<p>Just writing to see if you know about Barrow's new belief regarding the decent of Robert I. The theory is that Nicholas, the son of Donnchad mac Gille Brigte, earl of Carrick, married the daughter of Niall Ruadh O'Neill, giving the following genealogies:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Niall Ruadh O'Neill
<ul>
<li>Brian mac Neill O'Neill
<ul>
<li>Domnall mac Brian Ó Néill, the kinglet who arranged the crowning of Edward de Brus</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Niall Ruadh O'Neill
<ul>
<li>x inghean Neill Ruaidh O'Neill
<ul>
<li>Niall mac Donnchada, earl of Carrick
<ul>
<li><i>Marthok</i> inghean Neill, countess of Carrick
<ul>
<li>Robert I, King of Scots &amp; Edward, Lord of Galloway/Earl of Carrick</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This makes Donal O'Neill the granduncle of Edward, which would help explain Edward's probable fosterage with him. Anyways, Barrow arrived at this conclusion after consulting with a genealogist named B. MacEwen. It's in the new edition of his Robert Bruce book. It would also potentially make King Robert the great, great grandson of <a href="../../../r/o/r/Rory_O%27Connor_bdb0.html" title="Rory O'Connor">Rory O'Connor</a>, as Niall Ruadh's wife was his daughter. It was mentioned <a href="http://archiver.rootsweb.com/th/read/GEN-MEDIEVAL/2004-10/1098720450" class="external text" title="http://archiver.rootsweb.com/th/read/GEN-MEDIEVAL/2004-10/1098720450" rel="nofollow">here</a> before the publication of Barrow's new edition. I haven't yet decided whether or not I buy it. "Nicholaus" seems a little far-fetched a name for that cultural millieu (... who else would have had that name?), and the idea that "Nicholaus" was just an attempt to culturize the foreign name "Niall" seems a pretty good explanation. On the other hand, the argument has convinced Barrow and does have its strengths. If true, it does make you wonder how "Scottish", as opposed to trans-channel, the Carrick world view really was. <b><a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalgacus_587c.html" title="User:Calgacus">Calgacus</a> (<i><a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalgacus_321f.html" title="User talk:Calgacus">ΚΑΛΓΑΚΟΣ</a></i>)</b> 21:23, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>By "all new", I hope you understand virtually the only differences are more illustrations and this genealogy part. He's left much of his outdated stuff in there, not that there's much of that though. It is a very important book still. BTW, do you have or know where I can find a full, high quality picture of William Brassey Hole's mural from the Scottish National Portrait Gallery? It has loads of individual profiles that could be used on wiki, as the copyright has expired. In case this artwork ain't familiar to you, it's where the picture in <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cin%C3%A1ed_mac_Ailp%C3%ADn_4954.html" title="Cináed mac Ailpín">Cináed mac Ailpín</a> comes from.

<p>Hello There! Thank you for your contributions to that page. However, <a href="../../../b/d/e/User%7EBdean1963_fc4c.html" title="User:Bdean1963">User:Bdean1963</a> was blocked for 1 day because of his revert war with me in that article, and has being clearly warned about such a disruptive behavior here in Wikipedia. You acted in good faith to revert the article and remove a whole section that so far more than 3 Wikipedians have already agreed that doesn't belong to the article, but unfortunately your edition was not respected. I have already informed the respective administrators to take note on <a href="../../../b/d/e/User%7EBdean1963_fc4c.html" title="User:Bdean1963">User:Bdean1963</a>'s behavior, and I encourage you to not be intimidated for this outrageous behavior and put the article back into his original state. Thanks. <a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMesshermit_7871.html" title="User:Messhermit">Messhermit</a> 19:34, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello! I have reverted the article back to your edition. Hopefully, <a href="../../../b/d/e/User%7EBdean1963_fc4c.html" title="User:Bdean1963">User:Bdean1963</a> will not create more troubles. I was never against creating a separate article, and in fact this has being proposed by more than 1 wikipedian. Please read the Talk Page and tell me your opinion of this dispute. <a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMesshermit_7871.html" title="User:Messhermit">Messhermit</a> 19:45, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As you can see, <a href="../../../b/d/e/User%7EBdean1963_fc4c.html" title="User:Bdean1963">User:Bdean1963</a> has not responded. I wonder why. I'm changing his "Legacy of the War of the Pacific" article for <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chilean-Peruvian_Maritime_Dispute_of_2006_e029.html" title="Chilean-Peruvian Maritime Dispute of 2006">Chilean-Peruvian Maritime Dispute of 2006</a> <a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMesshermit_7871.html" title="User:Messhermit">Messhermit</a> 14:28, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hello there! The creation of an article similar to the one dealing with Ecuador and Peru can be one of the many answers for you problems. However, remember that as of today neither side has declared parts of the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Ancon_2584.html" title="Treaty of Ancon">Treaty of Ancon</a> or the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Lima_1585.html" title="Treaty of Lima">Treaty of Lima</a> null and void, or that there was a historical dispute between both countries for a certain territory. Chile got <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arica.html" title="Arica">Arica</a> and <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tarapaca.html" title="Tarapaca">Tarapaca</a> in war, and Wikipedia cannot change that. Only minor groups of nationalist reject this, but that doesn't mean that we have an ongoing dispute with Chile. The Maritime Dispute is another separate subject in both political and international context, and I think is better to develop it into a full encyclopedic article that will eventually include Ecuador, one of the parties involved and another country that had (but solved) a similar problem with Peru. <a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMesshermit_7871.html" title="User:Messhermit">Messhermit</a> 16:10, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Now, I'm deeply concern with Bdean's attitude. As you can see he simply doesn't bother to discuss at all and keeps attacking my person instead of my editions. I'm afraid that any change would be reverted by him. I simply don't know how to deal with him. <a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMesshermit_7871.html" title="User:Messhermit">Messhermit</a> 16:10, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>... and this is just random: <a href="../../../b/d/e/User%7EBdean1963_fc4c.html" title="User:Bdean1963">User:Bdean1963</a> created this article Chilean-Peruvian Maritime Dispute of to avoid working in the one that I renamed <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chilean-Peruvian_Maritime_Dispute_of_2006_e029.html" title="Chilean-Peruvian Maritime Dispute of 2006">Chilean-Peruvian Maritime Dispute of 2006</a>. <a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMesshermit_7871.html" title="User:Messhermit">Messhermit</a> 16:14, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The tag Chilean-Peruvian Maritime Dispute of was created to reflect the contemporary nature of the maritime dispute (the conflict continues to this day and did not end in 2006!). Please note that <a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMesshermit_7871.html" title="User:Messhermit">User:Messhermit</a> developed the page <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chilean-Peruvian_Maritime_Dispute_of_2006_e029.html" title="Chilean-Peruvian Maritime Dispute of 2006">Chilean-Peruvian Maritime Dispute of 2006</a> after erasing the page I had created called "Contemporary legacy of the War of the Pacific" (as the editing history clearly indicates). The page was created in an effort to address <a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMesshermit_7871.html" title="User:Messhermit">User:Messhermit</a>'s concerns regarding the epistemological legitimacy of including the current maritime dispute on an entry dedicated to a 19th century war. Nevertheless, I continue to stand steadfast in my belief (shared by the majority of the scholarly community) that the <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_of_the_Pacific_ca2d.html" title="War of the Pacific">War of the Pacific</a> continues to shape international relations and domestic relations in the respective primary countries involved in the dispute (Bolivia, Chile, and Peru), despite historically naive and uninformed claims to the contrary. <a href="../../../b/d/e/User%7EBdean1963_fc4c.html" title="User:Bdean1963">User:Bdean1963</a> 13 February 2007</p>

<p>Hello there! I'm afraid that this user is once again attempting to create troubles, only that this time it involves the article of <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_Peru_a5bc.html" title="President of Peru">President of Peru</a>. To make a long story short:</p>
<dl>
<dd>I finished organizing the Presidents of Peru and added a small footnote that neutrally stated: "President Fujimori submitted his resignation to Congress". Apparently, anti-Fujimoristas Wikipedians want to add that he "resigned by fax", clearly a "Red Herring" fallacy with the clear intention to denigrate this action. Nevertheless, a civilized discussion is going on in the talk page of the article, and all of a sudden <a href="../../../b/d/e/User%7EBdean1963_fc4c.html" title="User:Bdean1963">User:Bdean1963</a> is creating problems once again by attempting to force his POV in the article.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Do you think you can help us to sort this problem? your mediation in the <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_of_the_Pacific_ca2d.html" title="War of the Pacific">War of the Pacific</a> was really helpful and I think that you can give us a hand once again.

<dd>Hello there! Thanks for your reply. <a href="../../../b/d/e/User%7EBdean1963_fc4c.html" title="User:Bdean1963">User:Bdean1963</a> has a clear Anti-Fujimori political agenda, and just by looking at his contributions you can confirm that indeed he is not looking for neutrality but to impose what he considers is "historical record". That's my biggest concern here: that Wikipedia becomes a heaven for people with bias and slander against certain countries or public figures. In this case, the fact that he faxed or submitted the resignation is not the problem - after all, He was impeached by Congress. But why is Bdean1963 so obsessed with the idea of introducing that detail? obviously, to divert the discussion to a more favorable environment for him, a clear "Red Herring" fallacy. 19:46, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The position of the entry follows immediately the entry about Donnchad being slain by Domnall: here</dd>

<dd><i>Donnchadh son of Mael Coluim, king of Alba, was slain by Domnall, son of Donnchadh. That same Domnall, moreover, afterwards took the kingship of Alba</i>.</dd>
<dd><i>Congal's son, king of Na Renna, was slain</i>.
<dl>
<dd>I think it's funny that this occurs directly afterwards. Did the Galwegians back Donnchad ... how does this relate to the emergence of Galloway and the principality of Cumrbia? I'm working on the fate of latter just now, like to say more, but have to try work it out. Just came across the latter this afternoon reading the Hudson article ... and thought ... hah! Oram and Broun missed that! Oram doesn't seem to know this guy, but devotes a lot of attention to Echmarcach because of his kingship of the Rhinns.

<p>We have a problem in WP Films lately: Categories and lists of films are being CfD'd and AfD'd and some deleted without any notification in the project page. I see now that Russian Empire films is gone. I wish I would have known in time to explain some things about it. Well, if you see another film related issued being in the process of deletion, could you please notify us? We are doing our best to organize the huge amount of articles, we have started a categorization sub-project, and I think we should have our say in such matters. I know there are still lots of messy and incomplete categories, but I think the best way to sort them out is to first let us know about it. The deletion process can be very helpful (and has often motivated great improvements in leaps), so long as we can participate in it.

<p>As far as I understand it, the early earls of Orkney are regarded as fictional characters, oft. created by duplicating later figures (e.g. Sigurd the Stout and Sigurd the Mighty). I've never really given Orkney my attention, and haven't mastered the material (hence why I don't touch the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_Orkney_0f1a.html" title="Earl of Orkney">Earl of Orkney</a> article) though. From what I see from the article, you're taking the best approach to <a href="../../../r/a/g/Ragnvald_Eysteinsson_4e03.html" title="Ragnvald Eysteinsson">Ragnvald Eysteinsson</a> that a wikipedian can take ... taking him as you find him; the flaws come in when legendary characters who may be inventions get integrated into larger historical narratives and people forget what the first modern historians actually based their interpretations of events upon. Bottom line, he is a work of fiction just as much as <a href="../../../a/c/h/Achilles.html" title="Achilles">Achilles</a> or <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romulus.html" title="Romulus">Romulus</a>. You can have a section (Reality?) talking about modern historical opinions regarding his existence, but that's about it.

<p>I dunno if that's an invitation for suggestions or not. I just let myself go with the tide of my inclinations ... which I think is always the best way if you want wiki to be fun. If you're gonna work on the long planned SEMAs article, then feel free to use as much or as little of my long abandoned <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalgacus_Early_Medieval_Northern_Britain_eaa3.html" title="User:Calgacus/Early Medieval Northern Britain">User:Calgacus/Early Medieval Northern Britain</a>, which could save you some time. When my article writing time frees up again in a month's time, I may (as well as continuing by bishops project) turn my attention to <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_I_of_Scotland_5d51.html" title="William I of Scotland">William I of Scotland</a>, Alexander Bur, and/or the Alexander Stewarts. I really think Columba is an important one to do too, core topic as it is, so hopefully (if you haven't), I can get around at some point to doing that. I'll try to proof-read Flann Sinna at some point. You could nominate it now if you wanted, so long as you were prepared to respond to all criticisms; FACture seems to be sometimes the only way of getting extensive peer review. BTW, I put your article on your namesake up at <a href="../../../t/o/d/Wikipedia%7EToday%27s_featured_article_requests_5310.html" title="Wikipedia:Today's featured article/requests">Wikipedia:Today's featured article/requests</a>, hope you don't mind. Would've put little Áed up too, but there's a lack of picture. There's one on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/immig_emig/scotland/western/article_3.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/immig_emig/scotland/western/article_3.shtml" rel="nofollow">BBC</a>, the copyright of which is expired; but it is small and is obviously an anachronistic depiction.

<p>Actually, yes, but not with templates. You're a Commons admin, and I guess that would make you an expert on transwikying stuff to Commons. I've been trying to clean out the backlog of images needing copied, but it's a bit tedious. If Commons is down, can't upload. If Wikipedia is down, can't find images to download. If the toolserver is down, can't get Magnus's commonshelper to work (and too lazy to do it by hand). If the upload server is having a bad day - and that seems to be around half the times I try - no downloads. It feels like I must be being really dim here and that I'm missing something obvious. Is there an easier way to do things, particularly in terms of grabbing the images off Wikipedia?

<dd>Glad I could be of any help. I'd like to point out one important issue though you probably already know this. When you are uploading "free images" from en.wiki to commons you are basically guaranteeing its "freeness"... So it is very important to review each and every image. People often upload non-free images to en.wiki with a free license. It would be advisable to keep a list of images you have uploaded via the tools somewhere on your userspace. -- <small><a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">Cat</a></small> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Cat_0d3e.html" title="User talk:Cool Cat">chi?</a></sup> 15:32, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>PS, the kings of Strathclyde; do you reckon these should be moved to Welsh names. At the time of creation I decided just to go with Gaelic so as not to complicate things or start making spurious judgments of the culture of each one. I think now I was wrong, and should prolly used Welsh as the default. If you wish to change them while I'm on wikibreak (coming soon), then go ahead. Otherwise I'll look at it when I get back.

<p>I see you are the main contributor to both MS mac Maíl Ruanaid and MS mac Domnaill, so you are probable the person to ask: AFM seem to referr to both of these kings as Máel Sechlainn (Maelsechlainn) - is this a corruption of the AFM text or could there be any other reason? I've noticed that you haven't mentioned this version of their name in the heading (with Máel Sechnaill Mór etc), so I take this is not really a name used other places than AFM??</p>
<p>Secondly, and this might be impossible explain to someone with no knowledge of Gaelic whatsoever, is the meaning of the "prename" <i>Máel</i> and <i>Maíl</i> the same?</p>
<p>And thirdly, in popular tradition the norse king of Dublin, Olafr/Amlaib, is often referred to as Olaf the White. Do you know when this identification of characters started? I just wrote a piece for no:wiki <a href="../../../../no/o/l/a/Olav_Kvite_7689.html" class="extiw" title="no:Olav_Kvite">no:Olav Kvite</a>, where I have tried to deal with Amlaib Conung/Olaf Ingjaldson/Olaf Gudrodson in the same article while stating that the identities between them is uncertain. So far it has became more or less a translation of <a href="../../../a/m/l/Amlaib_Conung_7bf4.html" title="Amlaib Conung">Amlaib Conung</a> with additional references, but I'm working on it.</p>
<p>I don't expect you to be my own personal oracle in these things, but from the number of contributions I see you have made in these articles, I thought you might be the person to ask.</p>
<p>BTW, thanks for the links to Ó Corráins articles you sent me before, they have been most helpful.

<dd>Thanks for your quick and thorough reply. Good answers tend to bring more questions though, so don't be suprised if I knock on your door again. I've more or less started my private "irish medieval history" project on no:wiki, we really didn't have much on the subject, mostly some spin-off articles from the previous work on scottish history. Strange really, considering the norse presence in Ireland at the time. I noticed reference to some sort of "history of ireland"-project on en:wiki, but there doesn't seem to be to much activity? As it is, I'm doing bits and pieces, one day an article about a king, the next about a battle and then the week after that some ancient kingdom. With the present speed no:wiki should be up to date on irish medieval history in time for the <b>bi</b>millenial anniversary of Clontarf.</dd>

<p>Thanks for your reply concerning that map-link, and for letting me use the maps on your subpages. The proper templates for overlaying had not been implemented in no:wiki, but I've got a template wiz friend of mine working on it&#160;:-). It seems I can't copy your code, so I have to do the work from schratch. If you would like to take a look at the work in progress it is found in <a href="../../../../no/f/i/n/bruker%7Efinnrind_Kladd3_1ea5.html" class="extiw" title="no:bruker:finnrind/Kladd3">no:bruker:finnrind/Kladd3</a>, as part of my draft article on Ireland in the early medieval period.</p>
<p>Since you invited me into your sandbox I had a look around. Good to see that you are working on Eóganachta, I had a look at the article in the mainspace and concluded not to translate it. Would it be ok if I translated the first part of your draft article as an article for no, I believe that would suffice (for now - I'll translate the rest whenever you post it in mainspace.)<a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinnrind_eadf.html" title="User:Finnrind">Finnrind</a> 18:14, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry, I missed that one. Frankly I don't think it's all that problematic from an attribution point of view (although we'd have to ask a copyright guru to be sure).

<p>Hi Angus,</p>
<p>Thank you for the help.</p>
<p>This was the first time i add anything on wiki...i hope im not blocked by entering unallowed material!!</p>
<p>But i dont seem to understand why my link was deleted from the x12 &gt; external links.</p>
<p>My goal is not to get my page highly ranked, becasue it already is highly ranked within the keywords my target audience enters. The thing is that one of our custoemrs asked us:"why dont you have your product listed on wikipedia?!!"...</p>
<p>And upon their request I am doing so...and I have noticed that a product called "stylus studio" is on the list of the external links..and even other software product links.....so, how come they get the privilege to add there link and me NOT!...just wondering..</p>
<p>How can i make our software product available on wikipedia search?..Its not advertising...Its a product in the market that i want our clients to find when they search it up on wikipedia..</p>
<p><br />
Another thing...I am feeling lost a bit here...what is it that i need to know about wikipedia?</p>
<p>1- The welcome page 2- This talk page for when i encounter a problem..?</p>
<p>Thank again for the help&#160;:)...</p>

<p>What a coincidence, I am adding more to the sucession as we speak&#160;:) Hopefully sometime soon I will have finished with adding the main content and begin polishing it for FA. By the way, what do you think of the 'Insginia' section? I don't know what to make of it, whether it has any relevance or if I should just remove it?

<p>Thanks for the link, I really haven't looked much into FA previously. If your answer on the discussion page was "Indeed yes!" Máel Sechnaill did cooperate with the norse, then I'm not sure I can find a reference for that in AF either. The only ref. I find about MS actually having contact with them is him sending messengers to them while they are feasting on some poor norwegians (Annal FA 235).</p>
<p>As I see it, the present article on MSmMR is claiming he was having an alliance with the norse, as opposed to the claims in Cogadh etc that he fought them. That's the reason why I put the citation needed mark in the article. Now it seems the norse where fightinh with MS against Cinaed, while all other sources (I have seen, and that's really not very many...) claims the opposite. <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinnrind_eadf.html" title="User:Finnrind">Finnrind</a> 00:56, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To be a little more specific: Do you have any objections to me editing tha Máel Sechnaill m MR article so that it no longer says that he had norse allies?? The argument about Cogadh should also be linked with the comment about Thorgest, and not the fighting of norse in general. <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinnrind_eadf.html" title="User:Finnrind">Finnrind</a> 10:10, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I did some additional revisions, my point was not to remove the reference to Cínaed but to clarify that MS on that particular occasion was fighting <i>against</i> the Norse. I hope you'll look it over and correct me if there's anything wrong.</p>
<p>I should have just fixed it right away, and left it to you to refix it if I had been in error. I suppose this time I was a little bit to humble, and thus made you waste some wikitime. Take it as a token of my admiration of your work here - I normally just translate articles you've written, without wasting time checking sources (as I do with others). This time there was a slight misleading (in my opinion) emphasis, which should have been clarified by myself, instead of me nagging you about.&#160;;-) Thanks, <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinnrind_eadf.html" title="User:Finnrind">Finnrind</a> 23:06, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
