	    <p>Hi, I thought i would update you on the first part of my travels. I have tried to keep it short.</p>
<p>EASTERN EUROPE</p>
<p>After I left my employment I had a week off to sitesee London. I had a TO DO list of all the things i wanted to see before I left. Unfortunatley I only got around to seeing the four walls of the house i was staying at as i was bed ridden for 4 long days!!! It was the end of May and London was still grey! Rained all week. I was not impressed as this was supposed to be my summer holidays!!!</p>
<p>And so the lovely rain followed me to Prague, Krakow, Zakopane &amp; Budapest. I was looking forward to removing my black coat but unfortunately that very same coat featured in a lot of my photos. I hated it. I wanted my tan!! but my the end of my travels the coat was my best friend. It was my rain coat, my wind coat, my blanket, my pillow and I even used it as a toboggan down a mountain of snow.</p>
<p>In Budapest I met Amber who was a first time traveller and had been holed up in the hostel dorm for 4 days waiting for people to arrive. (as the Tour company was incompetent! thats another story in itself!). One of the first and lasting comments she made was "I hate people" I had to ask her 4 times before i could believe what i was hearing. Consequently we became friends and I got to learn about Body Modifications, piercings, tattoos and more. My friend was a walking art gallery. We would be standing by the road and RANDOMS would just come straight up to her and yank her arms about as they viewed her tattoo covered arms and then nod with approval before walking off. (And boy did she have the best tatts i have ever seen in my life!!!!). Eventually we sat down and discussed how "I hate people" is not a good introduction line.</p>
<p>We also did the Bath thing that people do in Budapest, jumping from 32 degree pools to 40 degree pools and then the refreshing minus temperature pool! (i didn't dare jump in the minus deg. pools.)</p>
<p>And then one night Michelle and I decided to see the opera. We were told that the opera started at 7.30pm, so we ran from our hostel to the train station to the venue to arrive in time for the performance. The place was empty but we could hear music. We had the times wrong. So..... ...we loitered at the opera palace whilst reviewing the performance for the following night. And then out of no-where a lady approaches us and offers us her box seat tickets!!! Michelle and I walked into the Opera House in the front row of the box seat. After we got over our excitement, we noticed people with their hair done, immaculate makeup donning the best clothes etc etc, and there we are... In box seats.... In the opera palace.....wearing thongs, frayed jeans, no makeup, hair all messy, just the perfect travelling look. (oops, just a little out of place.?)</p>
<p>From there I made my way to Croatia! And WOW what a fantastic destination!!! Great people, great food and nice beaches and AT LAST SUN!!!. It has a very strong Mediterranean feel. Went to Plitvice Lakes National Park where i was practically walking over waterfalls.</p>
<p>Who would have thought that Sailing Croatia would top that experience! I cruised from Split to Dubrovnik and visited some islands in between. The boat experience was fantastic, we also had a good crew who cooked Breakfast and Lunch every day. My days were spent sun baking, cruising &amp; swimming, My nights were spent inhaling strong petrol fumes and being woken up by my 20 yr old male cabin buddy at 4.30am wanting the room for private use. (and one night at about 3am I had to use the bathroom, by the time I returned I was locked out!!) sneaky!!! you know who you are!</p>
<p>So that's my eastern Europe experience in a nut shell. I have attached some photos for your extreme viewing pleasure.</p>
