<p>Is the Anglican Church still established in the Maritime Provinces?

<p>The Anglican Church is not the established church anywhere in Canada at present but you've raise an interesting question, I believe it was established in some of the maritime provinces prior to Confederation. AndyL 21:33, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.biographi.ca/EN/ShowBio.asp?BioId=37580" class="external text" title="http://www.biographi.ca/EN/ShowBio.asp?BioId=37580" rel="nofollow">this biography</a> the Anglican Church was disestablished in Nova Scotia in 1850 with the death of John Inglis. AndyL 21:38, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The article itself says the Anglican Church was established in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and PEI, but doesn't say when or if it was disestablished there again, just that it was never established throughout Canada. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><sub>comhrá</sub></a> 22:35, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Perhaps you can research the issue and put the answer into the article? 70.49.88.25 19:52, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't think it was ever officially the established church of Manitoba but it came out west with the Hudson's Bay Company - for example there is still a seat dedicated to the chief factor of the HBC in St. John's Cathedral here in Winnipeg. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECantis_9141.html" title="User:Cantis">Cantis</a> 20:03, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I couldn't find this info on the ACC website and I'm not as familiar with the structure of the church as I am with the Catholic structure...I was wondering about the archbishops mentioned on this page. Is there a separate archbishop and bishop of Ontario, for example? Is the Archbishop of Canada different from the Primate? I see that the ACC website refers to him as "Archbishop", but of what? The reason I ask is that I was adding Canadians to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Bishops_and_Archbishops_4016.html" title="List of Bishops and Archbishops">List of Bishops and Archbishops</a> and I wasn't sure what to do about Anglican archbishops. Thanks! <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Bishop_face.html" title="User:Adam Bishop">Adam Bishop</a> 23:32, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>This gets complicated but...The Primate is never referred to as the Archbishop of Canada, just as Archbishop so and so (presently Archbishop Andrew Hutchison). Note that an ecclesiastical province is not the same as a political province; there are only four church provinces in Canada. the presiding archbishop of a province is (I think) referred to as a Metropolitan. Then there are dioceses, deaneries and finally individual parishes. Confused? I am, and I've been an Anglican since age one. Here are some links:</p>

<p>It would go something like this (I think) Parish with (I've heard all of these) Parish Priest, Rector or Incumbent, Deanery made up of a few churches (this layer not always present) co-ordinated by a Sr. priest an Arch Deacon, the Diocese with it's Bishop, Church Province with an Archbishop (The Metropolitan) and the Archbishop of Canada, The Primate Andrew Hutchinson then the Archbishop of Canterbury. Note that a lot of this structure is collegial and not really discipline based unless it's a matter of doctrine, which is controled by the national synod. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECantis_9141.html" title="User:Cantis">Cantis</a> 23:13, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The Primate of Canada, is titled Archbishop, and so addressed formally as The Most Reverend Andrew Hutchinson, and referred to as Archbishop Hutchinson or The Primate. As Primate s/he has no diocese. Properly, s/he could never be called the Archbishop of Canada. A Metropolitan Bishop, is also titled Archbishop, and is addressed formally as The Most Reverend N.N., and referred to as Archbishop or the Metropolitan. As Metopolitan s/he is responsible for one of four ecclesiastical provinces. And continues as the Diocesan bishop of whatever dioces s/he was in when elected as metropolitan (for example at a provincial synod). e.g. The Most Reverend John R. Clarke, is the Metropolitan Archbishop of Rupert's Land, and Archbishop of Athabasca. Before his election as Metropolitan he was The Right Reverend John R. Clarke, Bishop of Athabasca. Note that the Diocese of Athabasca is not the Archdiocese of Athabasca. That is in the Anglican Church of Canada unlike The Church of England or the Roman Catholic Church, becoming the Bishop of a particular Diocese doesn't mean that one then becomes the Archbishop. So the Metropolitan of Rupert's Land have come from various dioceses, in my memory, Calgary, Edmonton, Saskatoon, . . .</p>
<p>Note that the four Ecclesiastical Provinces in the Anglican Church of Canada are 1. British Columbia and the Yukon, 2. Rupert's Land, 3. Ontario, and 4. Canada.</p>
<p>The Metropolitan of Canada would be the Metropolitan Archbishop of the Ecclesiastical Province of Canada (which includes dioceses over most of the civil province of Quebec and all of Newfoundland and the maritime provinces.) For clarity's sake, I don't believe he would be normally addressed as Archbishop of Canada. The present Metropolitan of Canada is the Most Rev. Bruce Stavert, Archbishop of Quebec.</p>
<p>Also note that within the Province of Rupert's Land is the Diocese of Rupert's Land. The Diocesan Bishop of Rupert's Land (The Right Reverend Don Phillips) is currently NOT the Metropolitan Archbishop of Rupert's Land. (Though he could be one day, if duly elected).</p>
<p>And note, that neither the Primate nor the Anglican Church of Canada are "under the authority" of the Archbishop of Canterbury.</p>
<p>And in our diocese the responsiblities and positions are as follows</p>
<p>Parish -&gt; Incumbent (normally a Priest, sometimes a Deacon, or even a Bishop sometimes we call ourselves Rectors, but that's a whole other can of worms - look up Rector and Vicar in the Oxford English Dictionary)</p>
<p>Deanery-&gt; Regional or Rural Dean (an Incumbent chosen from among the clergy of the constituent Parishes)</p>
<p>Archdeaconry-&gt; Archdeacon (an incumbent normally a priest (I believe is appointed by the bishop, maybe elected among the clergy,) An Archdeaconry is, in this diocese (Calgary) composed of two deaneries.</p>
<p>Diocese-&gt; Diocesan Bishop (elected by clergy and lay Delegates to an Electoral Synod. One who is not already a bishop, must subsequent to election, be ordained or consecrated a Bishop.) <a href="../../../m/r/s/User%7EMrSeanBrook_2c77.html" title="User:MrSeanBrook">MrSeanBrook</a> 21:53, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>How can "The first Anglican clergy arrived in Canada as chaplains on John Cabot's expedition in 1497" really be true?

<dd>The latest changes (and reverts) were nothing to do with me. I'm not overly bothered by the wording, it just struck me as rather anachronistic when I first read it.

<p>Much as I appreciate the extra publicity for the parish of which I 'm a member, I question the appropriateness of this section.

<dd>Maybe. The discussion doesn't single any parish out in an ecclesiastical context but rather in cultural ones; in Australia, where awareness of Canada (much less the ACC) is next to nil, CDs of both SMM's choirs and the Elora Festival Singers are available in record stores, and the hymn tune Bellwoods is discussed in the commentaries on the 1975 Australian Hymn Book; Willan's music is sung throughout the USA (though little known elsewhere in the world) and much of it was composed for SMM; Gerald Moore's association with St Thomas is noteworthy in itself. It's difficult to think of any other parishes which have cultural significance beyond Canada in this way. (One might make a case for St Anne's with its Group of Seven murals, but again these artists are largely unknown outside Canada.) <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasalai_b16e.html" title="User:Masalai">Masalai</a> 10:40, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>By all means take a stab at it. One thing that can go is the over-the-top demand for citations that has just appeared. Matters of common knowledge and common sense certainly don't need to be cited even according to the most punctilious bibliographic standards. It is analagous to the law of evidence, where judicial notice is taken of facts that are generally known; and for that matter, while one's presumption that the birthdate one celebrates really is the anniversary of one's birth, that is indeed a matter of inadmissible hearsay, strictly speaking but no court in its right mind would insist on documentary evidence. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasalai_b16e.html" title="User:Masalai">Masalai</a> 03:17, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Of course it wasn't just Dean Cridge who decamped from the cathedral; he took the major part of the cathedral congregation with him; on the other hand, that was essentially the extent of it and apart from the Church of Our Lord in Victoria, constituted by Cridge and his congregation, there was little further development in that movement and one wonders if is all that notable in terms of the wider ACC. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasalai_b16e.html" title="User:Masalai">Masalai</a> 04:08, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have substantially revised this article, with the exception of this section. I question its appropriateness, since it is bound to be - if you'll excuse the expression - parochial in its outlook. As it reads, one would think that there were no notable parishes outside southern Ontario, which is plainly not the case. Unfortunately, I don't have the breadth of knowledge to determine, much less enumerate what constitutes "notable" parishes - but I have to think the pioneer church in <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barkerville.html" title="Barkerville">Barkerville</a>, St. Saviour's; the Cathedral in Victoria, and St. James' in Vancouver must count for historical and architectural reasons - not to mention some the earliest churches in Atlantic Canada.

<dd>Conceivably Quebec Cathedral for its age — it is the oldest cathedral building in the country by some decades — and St John's, Newfoundland, Cathedral, as the oldest Anglican congregation by some centuries. There wouldn't really be any other parishes that are notable in a secular sense or beyond Canada, which was the theme of the section. If Barkerville parish is notable in a historical sense then one would have to list several others that have comparable significance, including Stanley Mission in Saskatchewan but it starts to get somewhat out of hand. St James, Vancouver, is notable for its high church liturgy (its music isn't really up to all that much any more) but there are lots of equally high church parishes across the country) and conceivably its unusual architecture, but then unusualness in architectural style became almost normative in the decades immediately subsequent to its building and it wasn't St James that set that in motion. Victoria Cathedral is an imposing west front and a few bays of what would have been a substantial nave but since its completion was essentially abandoned one wonders how it is notable in its final form. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasalai_b16e.html" title="User:Masalai">Masalai</a> 04:20, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>("Nevertheless, in the latter half of the 20th century liturgies steadily drifted into greater homogeneity across the ACC and former disjunctions among high-, low- and broad-church sensibilities became blurred.") Well, it was an orphan sentence in that it began with the now superfluous "nevertheless," which referred to the formerly preceding discussion of "high," "low" and "broad." And the discussion of those issues is now certainly complete but it is also a mite vague, whereas there are other articles that discuss these very party issues in the wider Anglican church which were once very important indeed, and the sentence usefully alludes to them in terms of their decreasing significance in Canada. (And, cosmetically, at least, internationally as well — Peter Akinola's and Michael Nazir-Ali's copes and mitres would have been extremely unlikely a few decades back; it would surely nowadays be the contrast between formal liturgy of any kind and virtually no liturgy at all, as one perhaps finds more often in England than in Canada, that is of significance rather than the old high church/low church disjunction that matters in terms of liturgy. And literalness or liberalness in scriptural interpretation and adherence to or willingness to depart from tradition with respect to the contentious issues of women and gays, which comprehensively cross the old party lines, with parties as disparate as the Sydney Anglicans and the old Rome-oriented high churchmen finding unlikely common cause.) <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasalai_b16e.html" title="User:Masalai">Masalai</a> 04:36, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There has been much evolution in the grounds on which Anglicans contend, however contentiousness and schism remain an entrenched tradition. In my editorial activity, I tried to highlight the continuity of party contention (which always seem to be based largely on cultural differences) as well as the shifting fields of battle (from liturgy to ethics).</dd>
<dd>I tried to bring out the high-low-broad aspect in both the history section ("Expansion and division") and the last paragraph of the "Liturgy and service books" section.

<p>"ACC" does indeed often refer to the Anglican Consultative Council, but an article on the Anglican Consultative Council would also need to define the abbreviated term: "The Anglican Consultative Council (the 'ACC')." That is the contemporary, shorter, version of what used to be rendered as "hereinafter referred to as...." And in this article "ACC" has been defined to mean Anglican Church of Canada. This is the protocol in all legal drafting nowadays: in a contract one might say "Carolyn Parrish Fan ('Fan')" and thereafter consistently refer to Carolyn Parrish Fan as "Fan." In a statement of claim one might say "The First Plaintiff ('Fan')..." and thereafter be excused from continually reiterating "the First Plaintiff," which becomes extremely confusing when there are multiple plaintiffs, defendants, counter claimants, counter defendants, third party claimants, third party defendants, and so on. So no, it's certainly not incorrect to refer to the Anglican Church of Canada as the ACC provided that it is clear in the context that that is what one means and particularly if one expressly defines the abbreviation at the first mention of it. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasalai_b16e.html" title="User:Masalai">Masalai</a> 19:46, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh, it's certainly not only in a legal context; I only used that example because it is the one where absolute punctilio is essential. It applies in any formal prose. "ACC" has been defined as "Anglican Church of Canada" in this article and there is in fact no reference to the Anglican Consultative Council (a considerably more recent ACC in any event, and for that matter one in which the Anglican Church of Canada has been expressly invited no longer to participate). You could check the Anglican website Anglicans Online, whose directory for the Anglican Church of Canada also uses "Anglican Church of Canada (ACC)" though, alas, without the quotation marks: <a href="http://anglicansonline.org/canada/index.html" class="external free" title="http://anglicansonline.org/canada/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://anglicansonline.org/canada/index.html</a> <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasalai_b16e.html" title="User:Masalai">Masalai</a> 22:09, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Using an argument from legalistic English is not appropriate to Wikipedia. The stylistic rules of scientific English and journalistic English are more applicable because both styles do not consider an article in isolation. In scientific English, one can not simply define a term de facto and de novo as if the outside world did not exist. In journalistic English,the principle of common usage and common understanding prevail with the arbiter being the 'common person on the street'. I have not seen a newspaper article in Canada ever refer to the ACC. It is always Anglicans or Canadian Anglicans. To expand on this, Canadian newspapers refer to the Conservative, Liberals and NDP when reporting political stories without regard to the legal names of these parties. You'll never see a newspaper article print Nicely Done Potatoes ('NDP') and then continue referencing internally this de novo meaning. Simply put, the new definition is not commonly understood. Removing technical jargon and writing in plain English is one of the tenets of Wikipedia . Wassupwestcoast 00:39, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Except that you are wrong: the Anglican Church of Canada <i>is</i> commonly abbreviated ACC. Again, I refer you to the Anglicans Online website, where indeed the reference is to the Anglican Church of Canada (ACC), and thereafter the ACC. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasalai_b16e.html" title="User:Masalai">Masalai</a> 00:42, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I fully agree that within the organization the Anglican Church of Canada uses the jargon ACC <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>. The issue at hand is one of style. Legalistic styling is ill suited to Wikipedia. What the website Anglicans Online chooses to do is only partially of interest. The question is one of common useage and understanding. An editor of any news publication would red-line ACC without blinking and wonder what the reporter was thinking.

<dd>Moreover, the tone and standard of language in newspapers hardly rises to the frequently repeated abjuration that Wikipedia articles must be encyclopedic. Plain English is good; it doesn't have to be simple to be plain. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasalai_b16e.html" title="User:Masalai">Masalai</a> 03:08, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>"Anglicans": Oops. You did go ahead and replace "ACC" with "Anglicans." But the ACC is not the only Anglican denomination in Canada. So you have introduced a quite unnecessary element of ambiguity. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasalai_b16e.html" title="User:Masalai">Masalai</a> 03:11, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>To me, it reads much more clumsily to write the name out in full repeatedly, rather than using a perfectly obvious abbreviation (speaking as a non-Canadian). <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Underdown_0d41.html" title="User:David Underdown">David Underdown</a> 10:14, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Precisely. Shall we proceed to revert back to what Mr Wassup considers "jargon" and the rest of us consider a "perfectly obvious abbreviation," then? I hope this doesn't become a tiresome revert war. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasalai_b16e.html" title="User:Masalai">Masalai</a> 16:42, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, three against one: I'm all for consensus. I've re-edited and placed ACC where appropriate. I might be slow on the uptake but I hope this "Anglican Church of Canada" vs. "ACC" is not a proxy debate in the Anglican schism controversy. It has occurred to me that referring to the Anglican Church as the ACC can be seen as an attempt to disestablish the ACC as the official church. Again, newspaper style in Canada refers to Anglicans meaning the Anglican Church of Canada and not to any splinter movement. Now that would be tiresome.

<p>"Prior to this, General Synod had adopted "l'Église Episcopale du Canada" in 1977 and amended the canons to reflect this in 1983[1] when it became clear that francophone Canadians were baffled by the term "Episcopale" but well understood the term "Anglicane." This sentence doesn't actually make sense — I presume it is intended to indicate that the ACC became "Episcopale" in 1977 and "Anglicane" in 1983 but I can't check it in the footnotes because the references to the Handbook are incorrect. I believe it was Carolyn Parrish Fan who dealt with this in the first instance: could she perhaps re-check it now? <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasalai_b16e.html" title="User:Masalai">Masalai</a> 20:16, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We still don't have this citation correct. If Ms Fan has access to the canons, would she mind correcting the footnote? <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasalai_b16e.html" title="User:Masalai">Masalai</a> 18:20, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
