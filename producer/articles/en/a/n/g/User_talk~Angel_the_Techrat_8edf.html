<p>The nick-names were right, I had been watching the show. Plus you removed important info. Fractyl</p>
<ul>
<li>Your nicknames are <b>not</b> right. The kana is nothing like what you're trying to say the nicknames are. The dialogue pronounciation matches the kana. Very clearly.Angel the Techrat 19:46, 3 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Brachiosaurus is refered to as "Brakio" on the show, I don't know kana, but it doesn't match the actual names said. User:Fractyl
<ul>
<li>Perhapse you should make sure you're not just missing the last half of the full name Brachiosaurus.Angel the Techrat 21:08, 3 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm sure, it's Brakio. Had you even watched it, to ask? Fractyl
<ul>
<li>Yes. And it's either bu-ra-ki-o-sa-u-ru-su or just bu-ra. Kana is completely phonetic. They spell it just like they say it.Angel the Techrat 21:59, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Care to tell me exactly what the details were? I had just rewatched "Legion of Doom" after a while and noticed the similar voice Moebius had. If it was coincidence, I apologise.

Thankyou...Kyle's father? Tsk, what a let-down, but no surprise given it's flipping TKR, thank god their boss did'nt like the idea and they toyed with Garth Knight. I am more of the opinion a corrupted Devon would have provided good emotional and dramatic weight, despite the risk of more fan resentment.<a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr._R.K.Z_7e8e.html" title="User:Dr. R.K.Z">Dr. R.KZ.</a> 09:01 AM, 6th March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think it'd be a lot more professional if you could provide the kana (or maybe show me the source, so I can use my l33t <a href="../../../c/h/a/Character_map.html" title="Character map">character map</a> skillz to work out the kana)&#160;:)—<a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong"><font color="blue">Ryūlóng</font></a> (<a href="../../../r/y/u/User_talk%7ERyulong_923f.html" title="User talk:Ryulong"><font color="gold">竜龍</font></a>) 21:59, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I was thinking of doing that after working on putting a kana column in the table for all of them, in addition to just the combos mentioned below. But if you want to do so, go ahead. You're better at wiki code than I am. (And..it's a LOT of kana.) I've got scans at <a href="http://thundershot.net/angel/6006.jpg" class="external free" title="http://thundershot.net/angel/6006.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://thundershot.net/angel/6006.jpg</a> and <a href="http://thundershot.net/angel/6007.jpg" class="external free" title="http://thundershot.net/angel/6007.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://thundershot.net/angel/6007.jpg</a> It was really one of the most interesting parts of the whole book. I've been meaning to work on an analysis of the pictures and such around it since I saw someone had already done the list of animals a while ago. Angel the Techrat 22:14, 8 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A kana column (for the GaoX part) would be good. I'm going to be indisposed for a few hours, so I would just use {{<a href="../../../n/i/h/Template%7ENihongo_517c.html" title="Template:Nihongo">nihongo</a>}} in the Gao name column. I'll do a clean-up sweep (or bug someone else to do so) later.—<a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong"><font color="blue">Ryūlóng</font></a> (<a href="../../../r/y/u/User_talk%7ERyulong_923f.html" title="User talk:Ryulong"><font color="gold">竜龍</font></a>) 23:09, 8 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Okay, all done and ready for a runthrough to put it into the hepburn system. Incidently, what can I do to make the hepburn vowels with macrons show up on wikipedia in my browser, and what method do you use to input them when typing? I can't see them in wiki except when in the editing field, and they're not on my charmap to get the alt-# from to type them.Angel the Techrat 01:54, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You clearly don't understand. If YOU created the comparison image, you NEED to say that.

<dd>Then by all means, please tell me how "Created by retinting character art image to match in-game color samples by User:Angel the Techrat." could possibly be <b>any</b> more <b>clear</b>. Either that, or tell me how to manually delete whatever trash I've apparently uploaded. Angel the Techrat 01:49, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><s>I was replying to you. I didn't need an explanation about how you created it, I needed you to POST THAT YOU CREATED IT. The fact that you did is irrelevant to the original post and the reply. The post was intended to tell you to not tell me who made it, but post it.</s> Now settle down just a wee-bit. Also, you don't even know which image I am referencing - I'm referencing one where you instead of sourcing an image, you removed a source tag and said "Nintendo made it".

You referenced <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:FUSION.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:FUSION.jpg" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> at the begining of this item. And I certainly would not have phrased something as ham-tongued as "nintendo made it". I sourced images at the time as they were advised to be sourced. If two people are having different interpretations on the matter, I'm tired of being caught in the middle, and I did notice you personaly seem to have managed to eliminate at least 70% of the other images in the Metroid Items article that others put in place well before me. It's not worth fighting over. I'm trying to back down from this, but I don't know how to delete what's been uploaded. If you'll just answer the question how, I'll simply make it go away. You seem to want me to give you some kind of other website where you will find the image of the Fusion suits and you won't. I made it, as is stated in the image summary, by retinting to the different augments, and this <b>is</b> the only place I've uploaded. At this point, I'm just extremely sorry I made it. If you're talking about some image other than the one <b>you</b> referenced at the begining of this item, then why am I remiss in knowing what you're talking about?

So be it. I have absolutely no way of finding out who the actual original artist that drew them for Nintendo is, and I doubt anyone else can easily find that information either. Remove the picture or tell me how to remove it. And why do you keep removing the text I've tried repeatedly to put into it's summary to phrase it better? Angel the Techrat 02:26, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Instead of overreacting unnecessarily, you could source it. Read <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> - the creator must clarify that they created it, and if they found the image on the web site, they should source it. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 15:58, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The image used was not <b>on</b> another web site when I used it. The imaged <b>I</b> used as a source originaly was an image that was already <b>here</b>. On the page. I just made a better one, depicting the powered up suits, back at the begining of January. The previous image isn't here anymore. I went back to look for what source might've been used on it, but it was apparently deleted because no page referenced it any longer. I don't understand why you keep talking about overreacting. I screwed up. All I want to know is how to remove my screwup so it's not a screwup any longer, and you both keep beating me toward a destination I can't seem to reach. The image looks bad on the page now, anyway, because almost all of the other suit images have been removed. Why have the most comprehensive image be of the base suit and upgrades that have only been in one game? Angel the Techrat 21:12, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
