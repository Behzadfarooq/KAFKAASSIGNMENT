<p>Thanks. I was wondering something. Do you think that, in <i>BITP</i>, <a href="../../../o/d/d/Odd_Della_Robbia_49ea.html" title="Odd Della Robbia">Odd</a> should fall in love with <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elisabeth_Delmas_1152.html" title="Elisabeth Delmas">Sissi</a>? --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngie_Y._d0dc.html" title="User:Angie Y.">User:Angie Y.</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, at first I didn't think that the OddxSissi shipping was <i>real</i>. But apparently some episodes hinted at that and that's good enough for me. By all means, make Sissi hit on Odd or vice versa. That could actually provide for some funny backstory to defray the nerves of the Kadic fire. Ulrich would probably be relieved and the reaction of Hervé would be <i>priceless</i>. MAKE THEM FALL IN LOVE! --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 15:35, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Ya really think so? How should we make that occur? --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngie_Y._d0dc.html" title="User:Angie Y.">User:Angie Y.</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>It shouldn't be that tricky. Have Sissi get trapped in VERY tough spot during the fire (think extreme, like the clock tower on the Administrative Wing. Don't know how she would get there, but it's a good thought), and then have Odd enter in a blaze of flamming glory (so to speak) and save the damsel in distress. To drive home the point, have Ulrich run away to Natsumi in Sissi's plain view. The combination of Odd's rescue and Ulrich's desertion should be enought to hit off a relationship between Odd and Sissi, or at least drive Sissi to start hitting on Odd. (Also, have Hervé try to save Sissi, but fail horribly so that she ends up hating him more when he makes advances). --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 15:48, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Nice! Like how Odd saved Samantha in <i><a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_Bottom__%28Code_Lyoko_episode%29_cb55.html" title="Rock Bottom? (Code Lyoko episode)">Rock Bottom</a></i>? --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngie_Y._d0dc.html" title="User:Angie Y.">User:Angie Y.</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Basically yes, although Odd needed Ulrich's help for that rescue (remember Ulrich karate-kicking in the locked door? Awesome scene). In this case, you'll have to devise a scenario in which Odd can do all the heroics himself without aid. I can help you if you like&#160;:). --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 18:56, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, you made an introduction and that was a pretty good stab at it, but you kind of left out the Summary, Recap, Memorable Quotes, Trivia, Next Episode, and See also sections. I'm not saying that your work is bad, indeed that was a great introduction, but the article isn't even close to being "done" in the true sense of the word.

<dd>All right. I think I figured out what is going wrong here. I never get my confirmation emails, so I never get the activation links, so I never get to do anything on my account. That's a problem.

<p>Do you think that any of the main characters from Code Lyoko are adherents of any religion? I've been giving this matter some thought, and I've arrived at the following almost-but-not-quite-conclusions.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Jeremie:</b> Atheist?</li>
<li><b>Aelita:</b> Agnostic or Indifferent?</li>
<li><b>Yumi:</b> Shinto or Amida Buddhist?</li>
<li><b>Odd:</b> Roman Catholic?</li>
<li><b>Ulrich:</b> Luteran or Roman Catholic?</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, my reasons for these almost-but-not-quite conclusions</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Jeremie:</b> Call me stereotypical, but Jeremie seems like the braniac science-loving logician who is ready to sit down and give you 10 reasons why God doesn't exist.</li>
<li><b>Aelita:</b> She got her memory purged by XANA, so she has no idea as to what God or religion is, at least until her memories are restored. After that it's hard to say. She remembers up to being (what, 12 years old?) she could have been brought up in a Roman Catholic or Huguenot Church, but I bet her mother would have done that. Franz Hopper seems like an atheist. I should know this scenario. My mom raised me on church while my dad played no part in religion.</li>
<li><b>Yumi:</b> She's from Japan, so you'd think her family would be adherents of a Japanese religious sect such as native <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shintoism.html" title="Shintoism">Shintoism</a> or the imported <a href="../../../b/u/d/Budhism.html" title="Budhism">Amida Buddhism</a>. They could possibly be Christians descended from survivors of the Ieysu massacres, but I've yet to see a crucifix in their home.</li>
<li><b>Odd:</b> He's Itallian and Italy is where the <a href="../../../v/a/t/Vatican.html" title="Vatican">Vatican</a> is. There aren't too many choices when it comes to Itallian religion.</li>
<li><b>Ulrich:</b> He's from Germany, the land the brough forth <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_b8dd.html" title="Martin Luther">Martin Luther</a>. He could have been raised on <a href="../../../l/u/t/Lutheranism.html" title="Lutheranism">Lutheranism</a> or he could have been raised on Germany's other predominate religion, <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholicism_4982.html" title="Roman Catholicism">Roman Catholicism</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the same time, I should raise the point that CL, in general, seems very atheistic in persuasion. I've never seen a church (or any other worship structure, for that matter), no characters has professed religious faith, and they don't even say "OMG" (except for once in <i>Garage Kids</i>). The only references to Christianity were "Christmas" and "Saint Valentines Day."</p>
<p>I don't know Angie. What do you think of all this? --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 04:55, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Whoa. All of that is too hard for me to sink in. Jeremie certainly <i>acts</i> like he's <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheist.html" title="Atheist">atheist</a>, Aelita died and rose again... yup, all too hard for me to sink in. Though I can imagine <a href="../../../y/u/m/Yumi_Ishiyama_c57b.html" title="Yumi Ishiyama">Yumi</a> practicing Shinto (think <a href="../../../r/e/i/Rei_Hino_c27e.html" title="Rei Hino">Rei Hino</a>), I don't think this concept has been addressed. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngie_Y._d0dc.html" title="User:Angie Y.">User:Angie Y.</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>CL seems to have a religious vaccuum of sorts anyway. France itself has declined from its Christian roots (as well as most of Western Europe) and is going atheist. I actually saw a news broadcast on CBS where a former Roman Catholic woman from France said "Breaking away from the Church is like growing up." Instead of going to church, she goes shopping. Anyway, sorry that I couldn't phrase this easier. I actually delayed sending you this for five days in order to figure out a simplified organization of my findings. Although, you brought up a parallel I hadn't noticed. Aelita died and rose again, much like Jesus Christ did. Of course, Aelita skipped the three-day waiting period thanks to Franz Hopper&#160;;) --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 01:27, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>And Aelita as a kindergartener was <i>so cuuuuute</i>! =D Just like Natsumi! --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngie_Y._d0dc.html" title="User:Angie Y.">User:Angie Y.</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>I heartily agree. The creators effectively made Aelita to tug peoples' heartsrings (didn't you just want to cry when the French Secret Police raided The Hermitage, and then when XANA killed her?). I like Aelita as a preteen, but as a little kid she was so heartwarmingly innocent. That is why "Mister Pück" was my favorite episode. That episode had so much action and tragedy and Aelita getting the snot beat out of her that it could appease any fan. But the most touching aspect of that installment was the very end. It was so peaceful and serene to have Aelita finally sleep normally with the doll in her hands. The last words of the episode were so heartwarming and uplifting and innocent. ("Come on Mister Pück. Let's go for a walk in the garden"). Yes, I'm obsessing, but it was so wonderful I left the TV set feeling uplifted. Innocent Aelita is so wonderful a character. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 01:54, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Now there's a fanfic I wasn't expecting. The minute I read about the javelin hitting the Krabe I knew that a new member had joined, but I didn't expect Sissi, and then later on Jim! It adds a great twist to the story, and having William lurking as that back character...this makes for good conflict. This fanfic is clearly hitting on the OddxSissi shipping, and doing a good job of it. Sissi has become completely reformed!

<dd>An artist must take his time, but I'm assuming that there is a power greater than you that is pestering for these drawings.

Trouble is, I've got crushing Summer reading assignments for British Literature and I'll be gone to New Mexico for two weeks starting next Friday.

<dd>I don't blame you, especially considering what he called you in his banishment message on his talk page. I wonder why he wanted to kiss and make-up though. He doesn't seem to be that kind of guy.

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>1: How happy were you while you worked wit KFan?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2: How happy have you been being banned?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you ever felt distinctly happier during one of these periods, that should affect your decision. If you were happy working with KFan, you might <i>consider</i> (but not necessarily) acqueisce his request. If you were more happy the other way, you might want to continue ignoring him. Only you can answer this question, but you might want to think on it.

<dl>
<dd>If you feel that strongly about him, I recommend that you just don't even consider reentering his service. Besides, I get a distinct impression about KFan. He seems only to apologize when his long term interests are suited to it. I think he wants you back for some reason. I don't know what it is, but he probably wants more punching socks. I find him to act nice towards other users to draw them into his wiki. Once they are there, beyond the help of Wikipedia, he can do whatever he pleases with them. You can see this with bishops in the Middle Ages, they almost always did something righteous when their interests would benefit. My advice: Ignore KFan and move on. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 02:32, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You'll probably be happy that you did. In fact, your banishment was probably a blessing in disguise. Apparently a terrorist group calling itself "The Roman Empire" led by a shadowy "Emperor Octavian" has declared war on most wikis on editthis.info, including Code: WIKI. It's given every wiki a month to surrender to their control or else The Roman Empire's allies will crush them.

<p>Up until now, I think that Code Lyoko is bit "local." What I mean is that we never see beyond the characters' city. XANA always attacks the school, and sometimes the city. But we know nothing about the country, etc.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, XANA will continue to attack the kids, but since he's free he can now do A LOT more. Do you think that his plots will get more ambitious and he will start attacking real-world cities and innocents? I'd love to see an episode where XANA blows up the <a href="../../../e/i/f/Eiffel_Tower_5c34.html" title="Eiffel Tower">Eiffel Tower</a>, as cliche as that would seem.</p>

<p>Well, I dunno. First off, let's consider the facts we know. XANA escaped from the supercomputer, Aelita has her memories of her previous life back... --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngie_Y._d0dc.html" title="User:Angie Y.">User:Angie Y.</a></p>

<dd>That's a good start. Since XANA is free he'll obviously have more power (think of Agent Smith in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Matrix_9295.html" title="The Matrix">The Matrix</a>). Since Aelita's memories are back it will probably be interesting to see what else she knows. She vividly remembers her parents and the attack on The Hermitage by the Secret Police, but the writers might explore her psyche a lot more closely. And then of course we always have Sissi and Odd's new shipping to look forward to.&#160;:) --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 15:22, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, Odd certainly acted disarmed when he realized he had fallen in love with Sissi over the Internet. Despite his denial, there might just be something between those two. I wouldn't be surprised if they do <i>eventually</i> fall in love, but knowing the writers they would probably want that to be an evolving backplot that plays out over many episodes, not just happening all of a sudden.

<p>Hey Angie. I just read the new chapters of "New and Improved." You and Matt R. are doing a stellar job at this TV remake. That was some awesome action in Carthage. I'm supposing that eventually Samantha and William become team players. May I make some suggestions?</p>
<ul>
<li>I think it would be cool if you gave the name of the school Samantha came from. I suggest that you name it after a famous figure in French history. Try "Collegé Mitterrand" for example, named after one of France's former presidents who was known amongst his peoples as "The Sphinx." You could even use that nickname as a slang term the other students use for their school (i.e. "I go to The Sphinx Junior High").</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Have XANA materialized an army of his biggest monsters. I'm talking about Krabes, Tarantulas and Megatanks spilling out of the factory and into the cities.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Have XANA's materialized monster change targets. I'm tired of the school and the factory always getting wasted in the series and fanfictions. Have the monster go on a destruction rampage through <a href="../../../b/o/u/Boulogne-Billancourt_388e.html" title="Boulogne-Billancourt">Boulogne-Billancourt</a>, blow up some big office buildings, a TV tower, whatever and then, have the monster pick up a large center of human movement to the west. Namely, <a href="../../../v/e/r/Versailles_Palace_0771.html" title="Versailles Palace">Versailles Palace</a>. I think it would great to read about tourists running away from huge monsters blowing up a landmark. If you don't like Versailles, have them strike Paris instead. Hit the <a href="../../../e/i/f/Eiffel_Tower_5c34.html" title="Eiffel Tower">Eiffel Tower</a>, the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Arc_de_Triomphe_3ffe.html" title="Arc de Triomphe">Arc de Triomphe</a>, the <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panth%C3%A9on%2C_Paris_9ffd.html" title="Panthéon, Paris">Pantheon</a> and the <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louvre_Museum_917e.html" title="Louvre Museum">Louvre Museum</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Add another antagonist. After XANA's monsters blow up sizeable portions of the Paris metropolitan area, have the French government start an investigation into the source of the monsters. They'll search all the likely suspects: the Middle East, Asia, the Soviet bloc, etc. but when they turn up nothing on terrorists they'll search their own nation. Have the DCPJ (France's FBI) start peeping around the country and have them close to the Factory. Even better, have William discover the secret and tip off the DCPJ. Team Lyoko's biggest fear is having the authorities discover their secret. Having the DCPJ discover Lyoko would add a most excellent twist.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Name two DCPJ agents. Use French names. I suggest Agent Collet and Agent Vache, for example.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Focus more on the Team Lyoko charter members. I'm talking about Ulrich and Yumi. I feel as if they are background characters in this whole story and they shouldn't be. The stories of Odd, Sissi and Jim are great, but they shouldn't be told at the cost of Ulrich and Yumi.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, these are just suggestions. You can reject them, but I since you and Matt R. are expanding on the CL creators' character list, etc, I think these additions would really help your story. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 20:27, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're welcome. I actually finished another one last night and colored it in this afternoon. It shows Ulrich and Yumi outside their house when Natsumi gets attacked by XANA, reacting to their daughter's screams. I put a couple cameos in the drawing. When you see it, note Ulrich's car. It's actually the Renault Mégane II, a small family car in France. Now, this story takes placed during 2017 so by that time the Mégane II will be vintage, but <i>I</i> have no way of knowing what cars Renault will pump out in that year. Do you? &lt;LOL&gt;. Also, there's a TV skyscraper behind the family house with the word FRANCE 3 on the top, as well as that station's logo. Now, I can't make any promises but when my Dad walks in tonight I'm going to bug him about reconfiguring our wireless print network to scan properly. Then, I'll send you an email with the pictures I've done so far attached. That could either be tonight or sometime this week.

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for contacting me.&#160;:) I was beginning to miss your friendly face from my talk page. For ideas on <i>New and Improved,</i> I was recently thinking about some.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>There's a plot hole I accidentally handed to you and JG. You know how I thought the DCPJ should investigate XANA's damage to France? Well, obviously Jeremie would activate a time reversion if XANA blew up something. It's not the physical carnage the DCPJ should investigate, but the <i>human</i> carnage. Okay, we've never seen what happens to people when they die in Code Lyoko and an RTTP is activated. Don't go into gory detail, but just have it mentioned that during the cataclysm, about three thousand or so people died. When time goes back, all the physical damage will be replaced (i.e., If XANA levels Versailles, the palace will be repaired). However, those who died won't come back to life. In the past, people will wonder why 3,000 people just disappeared. For added urgency, have some government officials among them. That will get the DCPJ on the trail for sure.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Remember the religion thing I brought up? I think this would be interesting: After Jeremie has the world go back in time post-XANA attack, have him grieve over the dead (ideally, have <a href="../../../c/n/n/CNN_International_f00b.html" title="CNN International">CNN International</a> playing on one of the Interface side-screens before Jeremie activates the RTTP. Have the anchorwoman announce that authorities count 3,000 dead in the "terrorist attacks" [terrorism seems ideal, since these people have no knowledge of XANA]). While Jeremie grieves back in the past, he should look out the window and see the Eiffel Tower in the distance (if you had that tower destroyed, that is, other wise just have him look out the window) and say, "The physical damage was repaired, but what about the human damage? How can one rebuild a life? Let alone 3,000? They can't." Then, have Jeremie go to his buereau drawer and shift some clothes aside. At the bottom, he finds a crucifix and a copy of the Bible, both given to him by his parents. Explain that Roman Catholicism is not so much a faith as a birth-right in France, and that Jeremie is a closeted Catholic. Explain also that he styles himself as an atheist and doesn't really believe, and breifly touch on the fact that Jeremie just keeps these two items as keepsakes. Have Jeremie pick up the crucifix and stare at the Christ figure on it and say, "They say that you died for all our sins and that we are forgiven. Are they (the dead) forgiven? Did all of them die in vain today? Are they really all with you now? How can I believe that? Darwin, La Mettrie, d'Alembert, Dawkins, Freud, Joloit-Curie. They all tell me that you are false, part of the human mind, a psychological projection, nonexistant. I used to believe in you, even love you, when I was young...but now I have a new belief and a new love: science." Throughout the story, have Jeremie struggle with religion. Make Ulrich or Jim a devout Catholic and have them be Jeremie's go-to guy for God. This struggle between logic and religion could be an interesting backstory. How it ends I leave to you. Logician or Christian? Take your pick. I would go for a middle path, personally, where Jeremie decides that God and Jesus can exist and are real, but have him believe that God works through science. Namely, God jumpstarted evolution, etc. I would have Jeremie come to the conclusion that: "Of course God can exist. Of course I believe in him. But I'm as far from an Orthodox Catholic as you can get. You see, humans have a tendancy towards the logical side of thought. It just doesn't make sense to them anymore that God can go ZAP! and Adam appears. Therefore, maybe God puts his miracles, his miracles of life, earth and time, into scientific processes that his children can understand." But that is all entirely up to you.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If you are going along with the DCPJ story, you should know that ranks there are like police ranks. I'd have two Lieutenants work on the disappearance case. When they search possible targets for who would want to abduct 3,000 French nationals and leaders, have them look at France's "hot-spot" enemies, namely, countries that France has cheesed off in history. I'm thinking Algeria, Egypt, Lebanon and Vietnam. Those seem likely for places that want to stick a thorn in France's side.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I'd really like the DCPJ to discover the gang's secret in the Factory. When they do, how do you think they would react? Gut reaction: quarantine the place, arrest the gang (Jim and Sissi included) and shut down XANA once and for all. But is that what our two Lieutenants would do? Ideally no. Remember, along with police forces, the State has other helpful resources. Namely, medical teams. I don't know how the gang will do it yet (I'll construct that in my mind. When I figure it out I'll tell you), but have them convince the Lieutenants not to shut down Lyoko. Have the Lieutenants agree and place the gang under protective custody. Have the French government explore Lyoko, help out against XANA and get cracking on Aelita's antivirus.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Eventually, you could just have the French government get XANA under control or...no. I just thought of a great conflict. When the government gets knowledge of the Factory, have them descend on it and Lyoko. Have their most ingenious computer scientists crack the codes and have military personnel explore the sectors. Have that shadowy government reactivate Project Carthage as well. Now, the kids want to help the government, but the government won't let them since they're just "kiddies." Have the kids banned from the Factory and everything. Now, when the government gets Project Carthage back online and corrupts Lyoko and XANA to their will as computerized weapons (much as Franz Hopper envisioned them), have them...do something. Nothing lame like take over the world. I know, have those anti-France nations I mentioned earlier forming an alliance to set grievances right with their former Colonial occupier (France invaded all of those countries). Have the French government use, Project Carthage, Lyoko and XANA to get back at these countries: infecting computer systems, crashing stock markets, infecting banks and international reserves, destroy communications, disrupt electricity, making life miserable, what have you. The kids, Sissi, Jim and the two DCPJ Lieutenants, as well as Sam and William (<i>maybe</i>, if you choose) form an alliance to stop this. That could be fun. You could even have Jeremie and Aelita co-program a XANA-esque virus to shut down Carthage, Lyoko and XANA. That would be stellar.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are all the ideas I have going right now. When I get some more, I'll tell you. Please respond to tell me what you think of these! --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 21:58, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Nice ideas! =D Actually, we're planning on having XANA go, but Lyoko stays. And actually, I picture Jeremie as a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant.html" title="Protestant">Protestant</a> rather than Catholic. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngie_Y._d0dc.html" title="User:Angie Y.">User:Angie Y.</a></p>

<dd>Protestant, Catholic, I don't care. There are still a few Huguenots poking around France today. Why not have Jeremie be a Huguenot,or perhaps an Episocopalian? The religion conflict can still stay that way. As Protestants, you could have Jeremie's go-to guy for God (I'm leaning towards Ulrich for that role. His contributions to the story have been minor, if any) be a Protestant as well. As for XANA, you can still have XANA go. Just have some computer scientists (or the kids, preferably) zap him. That will be fine. Project Carthage in conjunction with a corrupted Lyoko is enough to send four countries spiraling into chaos.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In fact, now that I think about it, if you and Jedi General need something to do with Ulrich make him a devout Catholic or Protestant or whatever. You could even have a scene at night when Ulrich gets to his room, kneels down, pulls out a copy of the Bible, crosses himself and says the Lord's Prayer. It would add a whole new dimension to CL! At the same time, we must attend to Yumi. Her role in "Sworn to Secrecy" was major, and then it tapered off from there. Reintroduce her to the plot. I can already imagine some scenes where she walks to school listening to Green Day's <i>Boulevard of Broken Dreams</i> or Nightwish's <i>Nemo</i> on an iPod. Really delve into her personality. What makes her a near-goth? Why does she prefer black? Does it have to do with her parent's unstable marriage? Does it have to do with the stress of moving from Japan to France and putting down roots in this strange Western nation? Is it some darker area of her past? Give Yumi a split-personality: light and dark, agressive and passive. Make her a conflicted character. That would provide some atmosphere. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 23:55, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Um, badly, actually. I know this is going to sound like an excuse, but I swear it is the truth. Honest, don't hate me. It turns out (I'm quoting my Dad on this one) that wireless print networks don't support scanners, so I can't email you pictures. That leaves one of two options. A) I get my email fixed and join deviantART or B) I manually mail the pictures to you via United States Postal Service. However, I don't know your address and I DON'T WANT TO KNOW IT. I don't believe it's in anyone's interest (much less mine or yours) to start trading addresses over the Internet where unsavory characters can find them. Although the scanner...no, wait, I need a scanner for deviantART. If I didn't have standards I would curse right now. Um...I'll see if I can find a third world scanner at a library or something and tell you if I find one. Oh, I'm so sorry for this. I really am. Please don't hate me! However, I can still supply ideas for your fanfics and I'll get cracking on mine. I finally finished my summer reading assignments, so I have some free time before school starts up again. But, sorry I haven't contacted you for a few days. I realize it got to be so bad that you had to tell me. Curses! Well, I'm not in the sunniest of moods right now. I'll contact you in the morning. Sorry again! --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 02:07, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Get your email fixed ASAP and join deviantART. The second option, you sending me the pics through postage, makes me queasy and frightened. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngie_Y._d0dc.html" title="User:Angie Y.">User:Angie Y.</a></p>

<dd>Well, sending pics through post makes me queasy and frightened <i>for</i> you. I hope I haven't come across as a stalker of some sort, because I'm not!

<p>Yes. Apparently, dA has undergone a layout change that most people do not agree with. Plus, <i>my</i> scanner's not hooked up either! --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngie_Y._d0dc.html" title="User:Angie Y.">User:Angie Y.</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, we're both in the same boat now! Maybe if the deviants get a petition going they can get the dA admins to revert the layout alterations. I'm still trying to hunt down a scanner. My city's library was gutted and won't be open until 2008, and they had to pack most of their stuff away. I won't have much luck there. I wouldn't risk my school, since if they catch you using computers for unauthorized purposes you get punished severely. I'll see if I can convince my Dad to take me to his office so I can see if I can use his corporate scanner. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 16:10, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Angie, I was just wondering. Do you ever have dreams about the shows you get obsessed with (i.e. Code Lyoko, Invader Zim, et cetera)? I've actually had an Invader Zim dream, which was basically an entire replay of <i>The Nightmare Begins</i> from the beginning to the part where the Invaders are assigned SIRs. It had little deviations, but I was amazed at how vivid and accurate it was. Oh yeah, and I had the first-person view from Zim. Awesome! How about you? What cool dreams have you had? --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 22:56, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I had a dream a few night ago. It was a <i><a href="../../../c/o/d/Code_Lyoko_0294.html" title="Code Lyoko">Code Lyoko</a></i>-related dream. I was watching <i>New and Improved</i> (watching as in CL episode-watching) with David Gasman, Jodi Forrest, Barbara Weber-Scaff, et al.</p>
<p>We were doing a commentary on the proceedings on the movie. David had to pause it so he could get movie snacks. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngie_Y._d0dc.html" title="User:Angie Y.">User:Angie Y.</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Hey, that's pretty humorous! I like how David had to pause the whole thing in order to get some food. I have, unfortunately, never had the joy of experiencing a Code Lyoko dream, which is odd, since I think about that show a lot. Of course, humans have hundreds of dreams every night based on their thoughts, we just don't remember the vast majority of them. In that case, I'm sure I've had several CL-related dreams, but just can't remember them. And speaking of <i>New and Improved</i>, I hope you and Jedi General are hard at work on the next chapters. I actually had a new idea last night! Are you guys going to have <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Hopper_84c2.html" title="Franz Hopper">Franz Hopper</a> in your story? I think he would be a good addition, since he has extraordinary power over the Towers and can even create/possess monsters for the group. If you do want to do Franz, here's what we can do.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Go into his personal history. His name sounds Germanic, so say he was born in Germany or something, near Munich. (I don't know why Munich. I guess that's just because my uncle has good friends there). He was a genius like Jeremie in school, but was forced into the Hitler Youth during World War II. However, he detested what the Nazis stood for and fled to France before it fell to the Nazi war machine. He had to hide out near Paris until the war ended. After that, he became got a job at the Ecole Militaire and worked his way up to ranks to be a top computer programmer. Because of that, he was drafted to help create Project Carthage in 1974. That's basically it. In Lyoko, have him help the group by giving them their own monsters to command, and have Jeremie learn how to summon/command monsters as well. Of course, we don't want the group standing down and letting their monster slaves do the dirty work. Have the kids fight right up there with their monsters.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Here are some more ideas.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Give Aelita a weapon. She's used Yumi's Tessen fans in one episode, it couldn't kill her character to at least have a scythe or something like that. Give her a spear or something, a homing javelin. Something like that.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I figured out how the gang can coerce the DCPJ Lieutenants into helping them when the government kicks them out of the Factory. Jeremie can hack military mainframes, so he can hack other systems. Have him bring up the Lieutenants' profiles from the DCPJ database and read about them. He finds a dark secret in both their pasts, like an act of terrorism they committed before entering the DCPJ in exchange for a clean slate. Have Jeremie threaten the two Lieutenants with exposure of this information to the public if they don't cooperate. That should work.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>That's what I've got right now. I look forward to more great work =D --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 15:44, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>A weapon for Aelita sounds like a great idea! =D Maybe a <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shortsword.html" title="Shortsword">shortsword</a> or something <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess.html" title="Princess">princess</a>-like. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngie_Y._d0dc.html" title="User:Angie Y.">User:Angie Y.</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>The shortsword sounds good, but no magic wands or stuff like that. I like the look of Aelita running around with a serated dagger. Here's an awesome fight sequence: Aelita vs. a Tarantula in the Ice Barrier Sector. The Tarantual is too large and in the middle of a flat tundra. Aelita uses her Creativity to make an air-taxi block of ice. She flies over on it, jumps on the Tarantula's head and stabs it through the Eye of XANA with her shortsword. Yes...oh yes. -- <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab"><b><span style="background:#009;color:#fff">&#160;Jer<span style="background:#f00">emie</span></span></b></a><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJeremie%40theLab_fde1.html" title="User talk:Jeremie@theLab"><span style="background:#f00;color:#fff">@theLab&#160;</span></a></dd>

<dd>You saw Mulan, right? Remember the dagger that Genghis Khan Mongolian general guy was carrying? It was all curvy and squiggly on the blade.

<dd><i>Undertank</i>? AWESOME! I hadn't even considered Jim's vehicle. Seems fitting for him, to give him a tank. I see you took my idea for the monsters blowing up Paris. Sweet! You didn't really go into it much though...just Mr. Delmas saying "They're wreacking havoc around the Eiffel Tower and other monuments" and then having a really short news clip before some reporters get killed or something. In the next chapter, have Odd and Sissi inflitrate the city proper, which is now probably under Military control, to fight the monsters. That'll make for some great stealth scenes, since they don't want to get caught. Have them gaze on the smoking ruins of the Eiffel Tower (which was reduced to four molten steel stub legs and a bunch of wreckage my a Megatank) and the stone remnants of the Pantheon. Since there is no geographical way those two can get to the Arc de Triomphe in time and do fights, have one of those big Times Square-style news screens on a building side playing CNN International. Have them show an inset of the stone remnants of Napoleon's arch. Have Odd and Sissi overhear some military personel saying "Targets are moving on the Louvre!" Have them strike out overland, past the ruins of Notre Dame Cathedral on the City Island and start fighting monsters with flair before the military even arrive. The monsters will of course damage the Louvre. They'll destroy the I.M. Pei's glass pyramid entrance to the museum and the Denon Wing (where all the good paintings by Da Vinci, Carravaggio, etc. are located), etc. BUT HAVE SOME FIGHT SCENES IN PARIS! Also, have the two kids see some corpses and just get hit with the utter feeling failure and "Crap, this is what we tried to avoid. Noooo!!!!" That'll be AWESOME! Don't forget the whole religion conflict and Ulrich/Yumi. I noticed you incorporated those two a bit more. Excellent! You two are doing an awesome job. Keep doing what you're doing with Lyoko. I'll leave Lyoko plots to you and JG. I prefer to take on the real world. =DDDDDDD --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 02:02, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We need more suggestions! =DDD --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngie_Y._d0dc.html" title="User:Angie Y.">User:Angie Y.</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Suggestions? Got some right here! Actually, if you are interested I will give you a timeline for Odd and Sissi's Paris battles (if you want to do Paris battles, that is. I think you should, it would be thrilling)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Leave school grounds and walk through Boulogne-Billancourt (their Paris suburb), which was hit by the monsters earlier. Have Sissi comment on how the monsters' destruction of office buildings and houses looks like the Blitzkrieg.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The sneak past Military blockades by climbing some scaffolding on an apartment block undergoing renovations, then have them cross a plank that spans the street between that building and another office building across the street. They will infiltrate Paris via the Vanves district.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As the two walk through the trashed streets and ruined stores and apartments, they arrive at the Parc du Champ de Mars. Odd looks down the parkland expanse and says, "Oh...Oh good Lord...no." Sissi looks over. Both see the remnants of the Eiffel Tower, reduced to four molten stubs of steel, smoking. Have the top part of the tower (with the restuarant) buried in the river (but they can still see it). That makes a sort of parallel with Planet of the Apes where the protagonist sees the Statue of Liberty buried on a beach. Sissi and Odd just stare at the ruins. Odd hypothesizes a Megatank did it, and Sissi starts to cry out of a sense of national pride. Have Odd pick her up in a tender moment and continue on.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Someways into the city, the two come to a big square, an intersection between two major avenues. Scattered around with the flaming Renault cars, have Odd and Sissi see about fifteen corpses. Have Odd start to tear up, and focus on the fact that he and the gang had been trying to prevent this. Have him say something about that. Sissi averts her eyes to where she sees something. On one of the few undamaged buildings, there should be a huge plasma screen TV monitor. Odd and Sissi stare at it. <a href="../../../c/n/n/CNN_International_f00b.html" title="CNN International">CNN International</a> will be playing, with the British anchor (CNNI is based in London) talking about the attacks on France's capital city. I'll make up the soliloquy, right here.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"And French authorities are still at a loss for the sudden and unexplained attacks on Paris by what can only be described as "monsters". The epicenter of the attacks comes from in and around the Paris metropolitan area, with all indications being that the attacks began from the suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt. The city of Paris is now under martial law at this time in order to prohibit the land attacker's deadly spread. However, there are reports of flying monsters as well, which have begun to attack the outlying cities of Lyon, Marseilles, Calais and Bordeaux. Despite the damage to these cities, Paris has sustained the brunt of the attack. Our broadcast from the city is restricted. Many camera crews have...simply disappeared. However, from the footage we have pieced together all indications point to a massive attack against the city's municipal and cultural infrastructure. A number of metro tunnels have been simply obliterated and caved in, trapping several trains apparently packed with commuters. These monsters have also disabilized the majority of the city's water grid, and numerous power plants have been levelled. All traffic out of Charles De Gaulle and Paris-Orly International Airports has been terminated, after an apparent destruction of the terminals and airport grounds. Numerous highways and arteries have been severed as well. In addition to this, we have been informed that, along with the quarantine of the city, the entirety of the Parisian population has been isolated in the former city of lights, now turned into a war zone. What we are about to show you may shock some viewers. We urge you to remain calm. As you can see by these clips, this is what one would expect to see in a city in the Middle East, rather than an international capital in Western Europe. (Have clip montage of destroyed buildings, cars, etc.) Also...(anchor is handed a report, skims is, and opens her eyes wide in surprise.) We have just received word that numerous landmarks around the city have been completely razed. At this point, we are aware of the utter destruction of Notre Dame Cathedral, the Arc de Triomphe, the Pantheon, and, most recently, the world-famous Eiffel Tower, the former symbol of France and the city. Casualty reports are nonexistant at this point, but from what we have ascertained, they will be high. We are receiving preliminary reports that the offices of the president and prime minister believe this to be an act of terrorism on behalf of the so-called Alliance of the Wronged (you can go into this later, this introduces the concept of those countries I told you about (Algeria, Egypt, Lebanon, China, Vietnam) that wanted to set matters straight with France for colonization and oppression. These are the guys the French government wants to get back at by using Project Carthage to destroy their economies. Economy destruction will be fun for me to explore!), but nothing has been verified. The Alliance member nations of Algeria and Egypt have issued statements denying any involvement, and word from the other members Lebanon, China and Vietnam are expected within the hour. We ask everyone to remain calm in this time and- (suddenly, explosions are heard from the studio itself. The anchor looks frightened before the feed is cut. Sissi asks, "What just happened?" Odd says, "I hope it's not what I think it is..." Sissi: "What's that?" Odd: "XANA's monsters just hopped the border...into Great Britain." Sissi: "What's going to happen?" Odd: "Who knows? If XANA's cronies can hop the city, the border and the <i>continent</i> in two hours...in a day, who knows? Canada, South Africa, India, South America, Australia...they could all be overrun." Sissi: "What can we do to stop it?" Odd: "That's up to Einstein and the gang right now. You and me, we have to defend the homefront...even if there's not much homefront left to defend."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The two walk on. They encounter some Kankrelats along the way, quick street skirmish. They arrive near the Pantheon, now a smoking mass of rubble and a collapsed dome. There's a military command post here. The two kids hide behind the rubble of the Pantheon and overhear tactical discussion.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Well, communication is sketchy at best. Reports are infrequent...staticky. These...<i>things</i> must be wrecking our satellite frequencies. But, we have ascertained that most of the bridges crossing the Seine are now destroyed. General, this map shows you the areas basically controlled by our enemies."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Map (Odd and Sissi can see from their elevated perch), is basically all black (bad), with dots of white over the Pantheon, Vanves and the northern suburb of Montmarte.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Before the General can speak, a courier arrives. "General, we have reports from Perimeter 3. Targets are headed for the Louvre!" Odd and Sissi look at each other, and make a silent pact to reach the Louvre and defend it, the one remaining symbol of national pride.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>They have to walk, since Sissi points out that the subways were destroyed. The two head to the shores of the Seine River. There, leading to the City Island, are no intact bridges. They are all collapsed and in pieces in the water. Odd spots a docked motorboat, they take it around the island. Sissi points out the ruins of Notre Dame, high up on the bluffs. They dock the boat on the opposite shore, just a block from the Louvre.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The two walk down the Quay and enter the Lourve enclosure via the Parc des Tulieres. There are no monsters there yet, so Odd and Sissi sit on a bench in front of I.M. Pei's glass Pyramid (new entrance to Lourve). Have a quip on French opinion. Most Parisians hate the Pyramid, so have Odd stare at it and say, "Boy, Mitterrand (president who ordered the Pyramid built) and I.M. Pei were retards."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Suddenly, they hear stomping and thudding, some rolling. They see trees getting flattened in the Parc des Tulieres, with the reflecting pool water throwns up. Odd says something, as a whole legion of monsters appear. Three Tarantulas, Five Megatanks. They see the kids. The lead Megatank opens fire. The two kids dodge, but the beam slices the Pyramid with surgical precision and it collapses on to the subterranean lobby. Odd thanks XANA for that, but then starts fighting. You and JG let your imaginations go WILD here. Have a super deluxe awesome fighting scene here. Just make sure that some laser bolts break down the walls of the museum, and the kids are forced back from the plaza into the falling apart Denon Wing (falling down because of damage). Here, the kids will be fighting around falling rubble, exhibits, giant urns placed in the middle of the hall for display, etc. And, uh, have the <i>Mona Lisa</i> and a couple Carravaggion paintings get blasted. Odd and Sissi are going to lose the fight, but at this point Jeremie and the Lyoko gang get the RTTP accomplished. All the damage is repaird. France, Paris, London, the landmarks, the paintings all revert to their normal state. Remember, before Jeremie hits the activation key, the news (CNN America from Atlanta, since London is getting blasted by Hornets now) is playing. It briefly touches on the destruction of London, and hints at airborn invasions of Spain, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Then he says that approximate reports of deaths in Paris alone is over ten thousand. Jeremie sits in shock as the white bubble engulfs him.</li>
</ul>
<p>After the RTTP, Jeremie is in his room, looks at the Eiffel Tower, and does his whol religious spiel. Refer to an earlier conversation to see the details I gave you on that. Now, I hope you'll consider all of this! --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 02:53, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No problem! I just got hit with the inspiration after posting the first message and just stayed up for an extra hour typing that. So, basically you can cut-and-paste this and use it as a guide, expanding on it. Ideally, between each bullet or so, skip back to Jeremie and Lyoko across town. Jeremie can be watching TV, seeing occasional broadcasts (which don't reveal much, since camera crews keep getting blasted or escorted out of the city by military. Jeremie can just say, "This is out of control!" every once in a while.) Looking forward to the next chapters! And, I just confirmed this at Cartoon Network.com. You probably already know this, but I confirmed it with myself. <i><b>SEASON THREE PREMIERS TOMORROW NIGHT AT 6:30 PM!!!

<p>I am happy to say that you are monopolizing the human side of the characters in New and Improved, while I do that whole evil political thing. Well, allow me to stretch outside my speciality for a moment with an idea that hit me today.</p>
<p><i>Ulrich and Yumi are walking through downtown Boulogne-Billancourt (this is after the RTTP post-XANA attack on Paris). As they pass by that photo booth seen in "False Start," Yumi asks Ulrich where he is taking her. He says, "It's a surprise." This implies that Ulrich is taking Yumi on a night out in order to patch up their spotty relationship.</i></p>
<p><i>A few minutes later, they arrive at a corner nightclub called "RAVEFRANCE!" Yumi realizes where this is all going and grins while Ulrich takes her by the hand. In through the doors they go. Once Ulrich drops a couple Euros to the attendant for entrance fee, the two enter the dance floor. It is Industrial/Techno Night, hosted by <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_France_9a2b.html" title="Radio France">Radio France</a>. The two push their way between other ravers and begin dancing to DDR's "Mr. Wonderful." Here's the clip of the music: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiKAgwDiI8M&amp;NR" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiKAgwDiI8M&amp;NR" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. It's the perfect song to describe Yumi's current feelings for Ulrich.</i></p>
<p>That's what I came up with. Any ideas on how to expand it? You are always eloquent with shippings and emotions. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 01:35, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, I did plan on having Ulrich (finally) kiss Yumi after the date. And maybe he walks back to the school with a hopeful smile on his handsome face. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngie_Y._d0dc.html" title="User:Angie Y.">Angie Y.</a> 01:41, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sounds good. I think we should reverse the kiss. Yumi to Ulrich, since she is the one who was having problems with the relationship (remember that split-personality charater I suggested for her earlier?). That's a great patch. Did you see the clip? It's Invader Zim! --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 01:43, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sweet! Unfortunately, in Season 3, Ulrich and Yumi broke up.&#160;:'(</p>

<dl>
<dd>Who says New and Improved has to follow the show's continuity? The whole point of fanfic is to explore what's beyond possible. In New and Improved, Ulrich and Yumi can just have hiccoughs in their relationship do to Ulrich's lack of self-confidence and intriverted nature, and Yumi's split-personality and troubled character. This dance club patches that up partially. And "see you tomorrow." Um...ooh, I'll just play dumb American here (sorry!) SAYONARA! I assume this means bedtime for you. I guess I'll be off too.

<dd>Did I hurt your feelings? Sorry! But I am still a diehard Invader Zim and Code Lyoko fan, so we're even on that ground. By the way, you're on YouTube aren't you? I just happened to find an account called "Angie2343" who is 19, from the United States and her Favorites section is chock full of Power Rangers. I just decided that was too much of coincidence to <i>not</i> be you! I've actually thought about joining YouTube so I can leave comments, how is it there?

<p>For going to the rave with Ulrich, Yumi could wear the outfit she wore to the prom in <i><a href="../../../t/e/d/Teddygozilla_%28Code_Lyoko_episode%29_d6b7.html" title="Teddygozilla (Code Lyoko episode)">Teddygozilla</a></i>! =D <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngie_Y._d0dc.html" title="User:Angie Y.">Angie Y.</a> 19:35, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, I did it! I watched the whole episode and...it was <i>pretty darn good.</i> I'm glad I tried it, it was worth it. So as much as I am embarrased to admit returning to my inner child, yeah, you hooked me on Power Rangers! The fight scenes actually made up for all the dumb stuff in between. Would you allow me to make one critique and then I will have nothing but good things to say about the show? Very well.</p>
<p>It sort of strains belief. I know this show is aimed at age groups who are not disposed to perceiving plot holes, but that doesn't help. I mean, the general public knows about this crazy psycopathic woman who lives on the Moon, and she is allowed to do whatever she wants. Right, if the Power Rangers were in the real world, the United States government would have nuked the Moonbase by episode 2 to remove a threat to national security. And another thing, the Moon is like, 20 x closer to the Earth than it should be. If that was the case in real life, Angel Grove would be a puddle thanks to the havoc that proximity would wreack on ocean tides. Also, they complain about how heavy industry is the main cause of pollution. Not so. It's mainly combustion engine cars now, most factories have filters and the "smokestacks" really spew out steam. I mean, the Power Rangers are driving age but don't blame themselves in part for pollution. Look at the Megazord-thingy or whatever they call it. Does anyone have any idea how much gas it would take that thing to move 10 feet? Probably a whole oil field. And it is highly unlikely that people would put so much random garbage on a remote area in a park. The slang/insults sound like they were written by executives in a board room (funky down the tube?!?). That's it! I've vented.</p>
<p>Thank you for turning on my inner child! So, this makes 3 shows both you and I like! And also, yes, have Yumi wear her prom clothes to the rave club. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab"><b><span style="background:#009;color:#fff">&#160;Jer<span style="background:#f00">emie</span></span></b></a><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJeremie%40theLab_fde1.html" title="User talk:Jeremie@theLab"><span style="background:#f00;color:#fff">@theLab&#160;</span></a></p>

<dd>Good morning! I'll have to be off in a couple minutes, but I had other ideas for New and Improved. You saw False Lead on Tuesday, right? You definitely, at one point, have to have Aelita user her weapon to neutralize and shatter the Megatank's laser wall like she did in the episode. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab"><b><span style="background:#009;color:#fff">&#160;Jer<span style="background:#f00">emie</span></span></b></a><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJeremie%40theLab_fde1.html" title="User talk:Jeremie@theLab"><span style="background:#f00;color:#fff">@theLab&#160;</span></a></dd>

<dd>I know! The minute I saw Jim choke-hold both of the Secret Service agents the first thing I thought was, "Wow! Now Angie will be happy!" I really like Aelita in Season 3. She has really broken out of her shell of inconfidence since False Start. She's deactivated the Carthage switch in style, blown up several monsters, done some zero-G dives on the Vehicles, all kinds of stuff. I am supposing you saw the episode "Aelita" today. She seemed sort of...cocky, almost, in this episode, bossing Odd around and all that. Ever since she got a weapon she has gone from victim to awesome! <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab"><b><span style="background:#009;color:#fff">&#160;Jer<span style="background:#f00">emie</span></span></b></a><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJeremie%40theLab_fde1.html" title="User talk:Jeremie@theLab"><span style="background:#f00;color:#fff">@theLab&#160;</span></a></dd>

<p>I even came up with an idea for <i>New and Improved</i> that I should tell you about.</p>
<p><i>In N &amp; I, the memories of the events in <a href="../../../x/a/n/Xana_Awakens_f0fb.html" title="Xana Awakens">XANA Awakens</a> (mostly the bad) come to Sissi in the form of <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nightmare.html" title="Nightmare">nightmares</a>. After just one nightmare, she screams in the purest terror. Jim, Jeremie, Odd and Ulrich are the only ones who hear the scream. Oh, and Aelita, too. Sissi is in total shock, and she is crying so hard she can't get any words out except "betrayal" and "monster". The next morning, the group investigates this, and Sissi is calmed down by now, having slept someplace else. Jim knows of Sissi's shock, having once been a psychologist, but as always he'd rather not talk about it. Earlier though, it's discovered that Jim can absorb large amounts of electric power into his body, a side-effect from being in Lyoko, without fear of <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death.html" title="Death">death</a> by <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electrocution.html" title="Electrocution">electrocution</a>.</i></p>

<dd>By the way, I had an idea today. MoonScape took almost all of our ideas fro New and Improved (government agents, Aelita's weapon, etc.) but what they haven't taken yet is a Vehicle. Aelita needs her own personalized Vehicle! And I think I know just the thing. XANA and Franz Hopper can possess monsters. Aelita should program herself the power to possess monsters with another "green" energy orb and make it obey her. She could hitch a ride on a Manta, or Krabe or whatever, and get some convenient allies for the gang. But this power needs a penalty, or else the battles turn into quick possessions and they end too fast. Each time she uses this ability, she needs to sacrifice like, 25 life points.

<p>Your Werdnabot installment screwed me up. I checked your page and our conversation was archived! So, anyway, I checked out the link for Power Rangers. That's a forum, I can't find the episodes! But that's okay. Believe it or not, I added your YouTube account to my Internet Favorites and I can use that for episodes. I've seen "Clean-up Club (best monster award)", "Trouble with Shellshock" (2nd-best monster award), an episode involving some giant weed (wors monster prize) and "Life's a Masquerade" (Best giant ball of clay that causes earthquakes for some reason award). -- <b><a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab"><span style="background:#009;color:#fff">&#160;Jer<span style="background:#f00">emie</span></span></a></b><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJeremie%40theLab_fde1.html" title="User talk:Jeremie@theLab"><span style="background:#f00;color:#fff">@theLab&#160;</span></a> 02:12, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Haven't seen Madame Woe yet (how's she?), but the Octoplant sort of threw me off. Narcisism was her downfall, getting slashed by the Power Sword while looking at herself on a reflective glass building! I suppose she wasn't that bad, I mean, just by wrapping some roots around the planet she can make it explode (horrible science, but entertaining nonetheless). I like all the impermanent monsters (the ones who get blown up at the end of each episode). The permanent ones who live on the Moon sort of freak me out, and once we get into that new cast of Power Rangers (Kat, Aisha, Tommy, etc) the monsters <i>really</i> give me the impression of their creation via LSD. The closest these permanents get to being my "favorite" would be Baboon and Squat, since they created Shellshock. Ms. Psycopath-with-a-smoker's-cough-and-big-wand-she-can-chuck-between-moon-and-earth is just plain creepy. So how is Madame Woe? What episode is she in? <a href="../../../j/%21/_/User%7EJ%21_3ef3.html" title="User:J!"><span style="background:#009;color:#fff">Jer<span style="background:#f00;color:#fff">emie</span></span></a><a href="../../../j/%21/_/User_talk%7EJ%21_2233.html" title="User talk:J!"><span style="background:#f00;color:#fff">@theLab</span></a></dd>

<p>She actually is one of my <i>least</i> favorite monsters because of the way she looks (blue hair and a <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kabuki.html" title="Kabuki">kabuki</a> mask doesn't fit quite right to me) and her costume is too flamboyant. She was in <i>Peace, Love, and Woe</i>, where Billy gets a crush on a nerdy girl named Marge. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngie_Y._d0dc.html" title="User:Angie Y.">Angie Y.</a> 02:52, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You mean "Nobody in Particular?" That was a great episode! As horrible as it is to admit it, I laughed when that Manta shot Aelita in her hiney. When that happened, I knew she would get devirtualized. Interestingly enough, Aelita doesn't seem to get fazed by devirtualization at all, and came out looking prety stoic. Yumi usually punches the floor when she gets devirtualized, and Odd has an asthma attack or something. You know, I am beginning to think that Jim has had too many jobs for a man his age in life, even for a running gag. Secret Service agent, salvage diver, sewer maintenance, and now an Argentinian <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tango_%28dance%29.html" title="Tango (dance)">tango</a> dancer?!</dd>
</dl>
<p>You'll have to tell me what you think about this, but I believe that croissants are the show's next running gag. After seeing Jim (as Ulrich) get pummled by a blitzkrieg of about five hundred croissants, I decided that this French snack food is a joke. Today's episode was awesome, and a bit freaky! The giant cloud that turns people into stone actually raised some questions. When everyone in the city got petrified, weren't they clinically dead? Unless it was a superficial petrification, everyone's organs would've become rocks as well and technically they should all be dead. But this is Code Lyoko. No one dies in Code Lyoko! <a href="../../../j/%21/_/User%7EJ%21_3ef3.html" title="User:J!"><span style="background:#009;color:#fff">Jer<span style="background:#f00;color:#fff">emie</span></span></a><a href="../../../j/%21/_/User_talk%7EJ%21_2233.html" title="User talk:J!"><span style="background:#f00;color:#fff">@theLab</span></a></p>

<dd>They sort of revitalized the gag when Ulrich (as Jim) actually said "I'd rather not talk about it," but it is getting far too old to continue. If Jim is still saying that at the Season 4 finale, I will put an axe to the TV. The gag is still quasi-entertaining now, but give it another season and it will be flat. The writers must move on to croissants! <a href="../../../j/%21/_/User%7EJ%21_3ef3.html" title="User:J!"><span style="background:#009;color:#fff">Jer<span style="background:#f00;color:#fff">emie</span></span></a><a href="../../../j/%21/_/User_talk%7EJ%21_2233.html" title="User talk:J!"><span style="background:#f00;color:#fff">@theLab</span></a></dd>

<dd>I do believe Madame Woe is better than you made her out to be. Obviously the blue hair is out of place, but I think she is easily the best female villain, with some of the best attacks. The real high point was seeing the Power Rangers make world's ultimated 5-pronged crossbow/particle impactor and BLEW HER UP! I actually went back to watch that 5 times. I still think the Polluticorn is the best, but Madame Woe has earned my respect. In fact, the only low point of this episode were fat youth-center owner attempting to dance and having to suffer through the cliche nerd vocabulary. Right, I'm what some people could call "smart" but I would never talk like Billy does, that is just creepy. But other than that, stellar episode!

<dd>Not in this episode, but in "The Secret" he was the one who saved the Factory by defusing the detonator. I bet in Monday's episode he will prove himself in combat. I was sad to see the Mountain Sector go, however. I knew it had to be done because the creators are slowly, gently, annihilating Lyoko so the show can switch focus from Lyoko to the World Wide Web. I still think Jeremie should've created a back-up file of at least one sector to his special-access region of the supercomputer, but that's just me. I'm sure the writers would pass it off as "not enough RAM to handle it" even though with quantum super computers the conecpt of RAM is meaningless: memory is extended <i>far</i> beyond most systems. <a href="../../../j/%21/_/User%7EJ%21_3ef3.html" title="User:J!"><span style="background:#009;color:#fff">Jer<span style="background:#f00;color:#fff">emie</span></span></a><a href="../../../j/%21/_/User_talk%7EJ%21_2233.html" title="User talk:J!"><span style="background:#f00;color:#fff">@theLab</span></a></dd>

<dd>All I can say about this idea is...<i>bizarre</i>. I mean, Xana probably would do something like that, but there isn't a real love potion that he can take control of, is there? Or are you thinking of something like <i>Laughing Fit</i>?

<p>Hi! My name's K9, I've heard about your <i>New and Improved</i> thing from A@L, and I would like to contribute! Every time Aelita tells me a story, I always enjoy adding a character of my own. Usually (more like always) it's a girl - exact age unknown - named Kida. In a story I've been trying to tell myself, Kida is a girl who virtualizes into Lyoko or wherever, and she meets Ulrich in Lyoko and falls for him. But she's really shy and doesn't spend much time around boys, so she's not sure how to tell him how she feels. If you like her, I'll tell you what she looks like in Lyoko and on Earth. -- <a href="../../../k/-/9/User%7EK-9_LVR_113a.html" title="User:K-9 LVR">K-9 LVR</a> 20:27, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>She seems interesting. Tell me about her. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngie_Y._d0dc.html" title="User:Angie Y.">Angie Y.</a> 20:37, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Well...on Earth, she's this girl about as tall as Ulrich, with brown hair that just passes her shoulders. Her outfit choices are very simple; if she's planning on going somewhere, she wears jeans, and if she's not, then she wears sweatpants or something equally baggy. Sometimes she wears this oversized sweater that has sleeves over her hands. She cares little to not at all about fashion, Sissi could teach her a few things if she wanted to. It's just that, as Kida says often, "If it's comfortable, who cares?" Concerning her attitude, she likes music because when it's live, like if she's watching a band, she says she can "feel it in her bones." Also, she's really shy, and she tends to hold herself off from everyone else because of it, plus she doesn't have a clue on how to talk about something that really matters to her, or do something that she knows is important - on Earth, that is.</li>
<li>In Lyoko, she obtains a completely different attitude: she's more outspoken, she isn't the least bit held-back, and she will give suggestions if not outright do what she's thinking. Her warrior key has her with cloven hooves for feet, three-fingered hands (and I'm thinking of the Mr. Spock thing, merged to three), white hair the same length as her own, and a golden spiral horn in the middle of her forehead. I keep changing whether she has pointed ears or not, and all I've decided about her outfit is that it's skin-tight.</li>
<li>Then there are her thoughts on the Lyokians. She's seen them often enough to make decisions about them. Ulrich - you already know. Odd - she thinks he's funny. Aelita - loves the hair. Sissi - think's she's kinda stuck-up. Jim - gets the respect a teacher deserves, but nor much else. Jeremie - he's smart, she likes his accent, but she sees something between him and Aelita. Yumi - no real decision. And by the way, she already has an idea on what's going on: she thinks that there's an enemy that nobody else has discovered yet, and Jeremie, Aelita, Ulrich, Yumi, and Odd are the only ones that know and fight this enemy. Sound pretty close, huh? But she doesn't dare tell someone her idea, for fear she'd get laughed at, or worse, put off. She just doesn't persist in something like William does. Oh - she'd moved there, and she'd virtualized into a different world from a different town - once. But because of it, she remembers return trips with amazing clarity, and she's trying to figure out how she's going to bring <i>that</i> one up.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry if that's a bit long. But, well, I didn't realize that once I got myself started, I would think of so much stuff! So anyway, that's what I have. If you decide to use her, just let me know! If you decide not to use her for <i>any</i> reason, that's okay too. -- <a href="../../../k/-/9/User%7EK-9_LVR_113a.html" title="User:K-9 LVR">K-9 LVR</a> 00:24, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So, about your new fanfic you mailed me, sound's interesting, at least for the utopian Earth thing. May I direct you to <a href="../../../u/t/o/Utopia.html" title="Utopia">Thomas More's <i>Utopia</i></a> to give you some ideas on how to make a Utopian Europe. Actually...If this destroys the plan you had for your story, disregard what I'm about to say but...Wouldn't it be cool if Earth was a <i>superficial</i> utopia? What I mean is, Western Europe (France, Great Britain, etc) was the only utopia? What if Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas were all dirty, dark dystopias that feed and support the Western European Utopia via their toil and sweat? Just an idea, but it adds a new dimension of darkness and plot possibilities. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab"><b><span style="background:#009;color:#fff">&#160;Jer<span style="background:#f00">emie</span></span></b></a> <a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJeremie%40theLab_fde1.html" title="User talk:Jeremie@theLab"><span style="background:#f00;color:#fff">@theLab&#160;</span></a>01:56, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey, Angie, has Jeremie@theLab told you that I have more Internet freedom? I read your fanfic this morning, and I think it's terrific! (although, to be honest, you need to work on your grammar.) When's the next chapter? As for me, I'm thinking of adding my story on that site so everyone can check it out! As soon as I can get a title, I'll do it! Would it qualify as a fanfic if none of the characters are exactly the same? The closest in my story is Odd. --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelita%40Lyoko_c6c3.html" title="User:Aelita@Lyoko"><span style="background:#FF9999;color:#a00"><font face="Script MT Bold">&#160;Aeli<span style="background:#fff">ta@L</span>yoko&#160;</font></span></a> 00:19, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Matt...Odd? Hey, here's an idea for a title for chapter 10, if you don't have any prepared: <i>Chronochaos</i>. Chrono means time, so that would basically translate as "Chaos in time." Considering how chapter 9 ended, that would work! --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelita%40Lyoko_c6c3.html" title="User:Aelita@Lyoko"><span style="background:#FF9999;color:#a00"><font face="Script MT Bold">&#160;Aeli<span style="background:#fff">ta@L</span>yoko&#160;</font></span></a> 23:45, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks, whoever you are. I think that this chapter could have Jeremie trying to fix the return trip thing and making it jump all over the place by accident. You know? Like, um...for example, Odd is walking down the street and suddenly finds himself back in the cafeteria, where he started. This could also be where the gang meets K9's Kida, as she can remember the return trips and would be helpful in solving the screwup. I hope you don't mind that I'm tossing a few ideas of my own into your story; the scenario you've got in chapter 9 with the return trip thing not working could never happen in my story (for very long, anyway) because the return trips are fueled by the towers charging time, so as long as towers keep getting activated and shut down the return trip will work. If it does break and start screwing up, it would only do so until it runs out of "charged time." --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelita%40Lyoko_c6c3.html" title="User:Aelita@Lyoko"><span style="background:#FF9999;color:#a00"><font face="Script MT Bold">&#160;Aeli<span style="background:#fff">ta@L</span>yoko&#160;</font></span></a> 16:28, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Any new CL art developments? <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngie_Y._d0dc.html" title="User:Angie Y.">Angie Y.</a> 18:50, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't have any "art developments," but I would like your advice on the name of one of my Xanadian girls. She has gray eyes and red hair. Her hairstyle is about halfway in between Sissi's 'do in the <i>Teddigozilla</i> dance and Aelita's natural hair. She has a slightly snobbish attitude, can behave very sexily when she wants to and has a very nasty temper. Her name used to be Lara, but then I came up with another girl with a similar name (one I like better), so now the redhead's name is Ginger. You know, like the spice girl...I seem to recall from the papers that <i>that</i> particular girl dropped out. If you like the name Ginger, tell me; I personally think it fits. If you don't, then give me a different suggestion. By the time I landed on Ginger, I was pretty well out of ideas. --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelita%40Lyoko_c6c3.html" title="User:Aelita@Lyoko"><span style="background:#f99;color:#009;font-family:Script MT Bold">&#160;Aeli<span style="background:#d00">ta@L</span>yoko&#160;</span></a><sup><a href="../../../a/e/l/User_talk%7EAelita%40Lyoko_9fc0.html" title="User talk:Aelita@Lyoko">(talk)</a></sup> 21:25, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Firstly, and incredibly, Code: Lyoko is going to be aired in Japan!</p>
<p>The reason why this is incredible is because in Japan, out of all the animation that's aired on TV, only 3% of the total is foreign.</p>
<p>For Code: Lyoko to recieve valuable airtime on Japanese networks is tantamount to it's quality.</p>
<p>Also, Moonscoop is branching out - it's purchased a multimedia company called 'Queen Bee' and in 2007 comes the most extraordinary development of all...</p>
<p>MOONSCOOP WILL HAVE IT'S OWN CABLE CHANNEL!</p>
<p>No word of a lie - this new channel (called Kabillion) will broadcast in France AND the USA this year.</p>
<p>And this is all due to the runaway success of our favourite show.</p>
<p>From Antefilms, to this. In three years. That's...just...WOW!</p>

<dd>No kidding! Not like I can watch any of it, but that is big news. Say...I thought of something else that you could toss to Matt about Code Lyoko Season 4. Remember from <i>Triple Trouble</i> when Odd was turned into three people? Well, that would mean that aside from the return trip, he has <i>three different memories</i> of the <i>same day!</i> Wouldn't that cause some kind of a challenge somewhere along the line? So one of the season 4 episodes could sort of follow up on that - like, a new minor ability born out of the triple memory. I mentioned the idea to my guitar teacher last week and he suggested a kind of increased insight. You know, different perspectives? That would be cool, especially for seeing through traps and illusions. Next time you talk to Matt, see what he says! --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelita%40Lyoko_c6c3.html" title="User:Aelita@Lyoko"><span style="background:#f99;color:#009;font-family:Script MT Bold">&#160;Aeli<span style="background:#d00">ta@L</span>yoko&#160;</span></a><sup><a href="../../../a/e/l/User_talk%7EAelita%40Lyoko_9fc0.html" title="User talk:Aelita@Lyoko">(talk)</a></sup> 23:39, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's gratifying to see a young person appreciate the classic Warner cartoons. They operate on more than one level. Not only are they funny and action-packed, they also provide a window into popular culture of the 1940s, especially on topics connected with radio and with the war. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 19:13, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
