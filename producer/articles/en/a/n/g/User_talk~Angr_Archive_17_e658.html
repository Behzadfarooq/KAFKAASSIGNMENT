<p>Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti’s body has not yet been recovered yet, you can check any media source, so how can you say hes dead? Please, unblock spinster678 and neville123. Nawab Bugti is not JIMMY HOFFA, remember that. When his dead body is found, whosoever wishes can pronounce him dead on wikpedia. In the meanwhile, please unblock these two users, its quite frustrating really since they’re family members of Nawab Bugti while all these other idiots are people who have nothing to do with Pakistan, let alone Nawab Bugti. Thankyou!</p>

<p>Hi Angr, I have come across your edits on more than a couple of occasions, and you appear to be familiar with image copyright tags etc. Well, I have got permission from artist Don Troiani's secretary to use "Sons of Erin", only on Wikipedia, from website <a href="http://www.69thnysv.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.69thnysv.org/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. They have sent me a higher resolution image for that purpose which I have now on my computer. If you could help me on this, with proper tags ect, that would be most helpful. Thanks. <a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEagleston_2372.html" title="User:Eagleston">Eagleston</a> 16:46, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the advice. I see other images on WP have a "copyright notice" attached to their upload info page. How can they still retain copyright and not others? <a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEagleston_2372.html" title="User:Eagleston">Eagleston</a> 17:08, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If the said image was a low resolution &lt;&lt;Promotional&gt;&gt; image by the artist. Then would it be OK to use it on <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_American_b5d5.html" title="Irish American">Irish American</a> page? And, will copyright still be held by the artist etc?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Memories of the AUM scare</span></h2>
<p>For about a week in mid January 2006, you edited some articles (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Chopin&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=35318680" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Chopin&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=35318680" rel="nofollow">Chopin</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Welsh_morphology&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=35001511" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Welsh_morphology&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=35001511" rel="nofollow">Welsh morphology</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=American_English&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=34726760" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=American_English&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=34726760" rel="nofollow">American English</a>) to remove calls of the "book reference" template, citing a then proposed (and later rejected) policy "WP:AUM". I'm not calling anybody a troll, I believe everybody acted in good faith. But in retrospect the entire incident sounds like a medieval witch hunt, or perhaps the parody of it in <i><a href="../../../m/o/n/Monty_Python_and_the_Holy_Grail_3131.html" title="Monty Python and the Holy Grail">Monty Python and the Holy Grail</a></i>. This time I guess it all ended with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Avoid_using_meta-templates/Archive_3#Developer_statement" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Avoid_using_meta-templates/Archive_3#Developer_statement" rel="nofollow">Brion Vibber's comment</a> on January 21.

I don't know if I have found all parts of this discussion. It's not easy to dig up history about Wikipedia. Have you tried to summarize these events? How much can you recall? Do you keep a diary about your WP life? (I must admit I don't, and I regret that.) Have you got any idea if more people were involved in removing book reference template calls, and how many articles could have been touched by this? When trying to analyze the monthly dumps, the template calls mean I can find data and know what they mean, but the substituted plain text is opaque. So not only did you waste your time doing these edits, but you also reduced the value of the articles. Book reference has since been replaced by the template "cite book", currently used in 36,300 articles, and the entire syntax for conditionals has been introduced. --<a href="../../../l/a/2/User%7ELA2_a404.html" title="User:LA2">LA2</a> 22:13, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm aware of all that. I use {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_book_c666.html" title="Template:Cite book">cite book</a>}} myself now regularly. When I wrote "Netoholic is certainly right that we have to avoid meta-templates", <a href="../../../a/u/m/WP%7EAUM_b93f.html" title="WP:AUM">WP:AUM</a> was marked as being policy, so I was doing my bit to implement it. I don't know who else might have been removing the old book reference template, nor do I know now what articles I removed it from, though you could certainly dig through my contributions from about that time if you really want to find out. It wasn't systematic: if I was reading an article and noticed the book reference template in it, I usually removed it, but I didn't make any especial effort to try to find them all and remove them. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> 06:58, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh crap, it looks like they changed it or made a mistake earlier or something.

<dd>Well, it all came from <a href="http://www.unicode.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.unicode.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.unicode.org/</a>, so I thought so. But it doesn't match up with the link Ptcamn supplied above, and neither do the two fonts I have that include characters between U+0242 and U+024F, AbRomanSerif and Aboriginal Sans. In both of those fonts, U+0242 is capital B with a stroke, U+024E is lowercase y with a stroke, and U+024F is empty. And since those are the only fonts I have installed, that's how they appear for me: &amp;#x242; is ɂ, which for me looks like capital B with a stroke, but is supposed to be a lowercase glottal stop, while &amp;#x24e; is Ɏ, which for me looks like a lowercase y with a stroke, but is supposed to be the capital. Very annoying, especially since there are so very few fonts that have this series of characters to begin with. Do <i>you</i> know of a free font that has them correctly encoded?

<p>I've found another set of errors in AbRoman Serif and Aboriginal Sans, and these are still there in the current version. According to Unicode 5.0, U+2C65 through U+2C6C are supposed to be, in order: small letter a with stroke, small letter t with diagonal stroke, capital letter H with descender, small letter h with descender, capital letter K with descender, small letter k with descender, capital letter Z with descender, and small letter z with descender. Instead, in these fonts, the small a and t with strokes come at the end of this series instead of the beginning of it. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> 20:04, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Two minor Irish questions</span></h2>
<p>Hi, Angr! It's been a while since I bugged you, hasn't it?&#160;:) I have just two really minor questions this time. If you could answer them whenever you have a spare minute, I'd be very grateful.</p>
<ol>
<li>How is <i>abhaile</i> pronounced? According to <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_orthography.html" title="Irish orthography">my pronunciation bible</a>, it's supposed to be <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/'aulʲə/</span>, but what I hear is more like <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ə'walʲə/</span> (which kind of makes sense, when you think that <i>abhaile</i> is a form of <i>baile</i>). Still, which is right (standard)?
<dl>
<dd>I say [ə'waljə], if that helps. <span class="internal" title="View my user page" style="white-space: nowrap;">-- <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvertype_f1b1.html" title="User:Evertype">Evertype</a>·<a href="../../../e/v/e/User_talk%7EEvertype_12bd.html" title="User talk:Evertype"><span title="Leave me a message">✆</span></a></span> 21:33, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>In sentences <i>Bheinn ansin</i> (I would be there) and <i>Bhínn ansin</i> (I used to be there), is <i>bheinn</i> pronounced exactly the same as <i>bhínn</i>? That is my impression based on the pronunciation guidelines. If they <i>are</i> pronounced the same, how would I know if the speaker means "would be" or "used to be"? If they are not, what is the difference?
<dl>
<dd>I say [vejŋ] and [vi:ɲ], if that helps. <span class="internal" title="View my user page" style="white-space: nowrap;">-- <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvertype_f1b1.html" title="User:Evertype">Evertype</a>·<a href="../../../e/v/e/User_talk%7EEvertype_12bd.html" title="User talk:Evertype"><span title="Leave me a message">✆</span></a></span> 21:33, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the tips, Evertype! Whether it helps or not depends on which dialect of Irish you are speaking. In order not to get confused to death, I stick with Caighdeán/Connacht (I may move on to incorporating other dialects in a few years). Which part of Ireland are you from?--<a href="../../../a/g/_/User%7EAg_Foghlaim_ee64.html" title="User:Ag Foghlaim">Ag Foghlaim</a> 21:48, 20 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree with Evertype's answers. <i>abhaile</i> is indeed basically "a-bhaile", it belongs to the class of Irish adverbs that begin with unstressed [ə]. And <i>bheinn</i> is an exception to the rule that <i>ei</i> is usually pronounced <i>i</i> before nasals; as we talked about last time, these forms of "tá" like to play by their own rules. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> 06:29, 21 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Darn, I knew I should have asked you about <i>all</i> forms of <i>tá</i> just in case! Anyway, I see that Evertype indicated above that he pronounces <i>bhínn</i> as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/vi:ɲ/</span>. What is that <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɲ/</span> sound? Is it the same as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/nʲ/</span>, <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ŋʲ/</span>, or something completely different (sort of like <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɲ/</span> in French <i>ga<u>gn</u>er</i>, maybe)? I don't see this particular symbol anywhere else in the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_orthography.html" title="Irish orthography">Irish orthography</a> article. And speaking of Irish orthography, I see that you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Irish_orthography&amp;curid=1347074&amp;diff=76949511&amp;oldid=76252110" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Irish_orthography&amp;curid=1347074&amp;diff=76949511&amp;oldid=76252110" rel="nofollow">added</a> a couple exceptions for the <i>ea</i> and <i>eo</i> combinations (which was very helpful to me, by the way). Two questions about that: are <i>(an)seo</i> and <i>seomra</i> not qualifying exceptions as well? Is the <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/o/</span> sound in <i>beag</i> really <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/o/</span>? On the tapes I listen to (with one of them, however, being Munster-based), it kind of sounds like <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/o/</span>, but it's not really the same <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/o/</span> as in other words. Am I just being too concious about such minor details, or am I just listening to the wrong tapes?</dd>
<dd>Finally, are there other (common) adverbs structured in the same way as <i>abhaile</i>?</dd>
<dd>As usual, there is no end to my gratitude for your invaluable help. If it weren't for you patiently answering my questions, I would have probably put my Irish studies to end soon after I started. With your help, it will be my first anniversary next week, <i>and</i> I am excited to report that I find myself understanding 40-60% of content of unabridged Irish texts (such as the <i>Lá</i> articles or articles in Irish Wikipedia), or 70-80% with a dictionary (although I'm not having that much success on the speaking front, nor is it easy for me to write in Irish myself yet).

<dl>
<dd><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɲ/</span> is basically like in French <i>ga<b>gn</b>er</i>. It's used in northerly dialects (Mayo (where Evertype lives) and Donegal) as the "tense" equivalent of <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/nʲ/</span>. <i>Seomra</i> has a long vowel AFAIK, but you're right that <i>(an)seo</i> is another exception; I forgot it before. The vowel of <i>beag</i> is certainly phonemically /o/ in most accents (though in Donegal it sure sounded more like /e/ to me), but phonetically it's probably rather fronted because of following a palatalized consonant. Keep in mind that the color (backness vs. frontness) of short vowels in Irish is almost entirely determined by the quality of the surrounding consonants. If when pronouncing <i>beag</i> you're careful to make the <i>b</i> properly palatalized and the <i>g</i> good and back, just get the height of the vowel right (mid, not high or low), and the color will almost take care of itself. There's a whole slew of adverbs starting with an unstressed [ə]: besides <i>abhaile</i>, there's <i>abhus</i>, <i>anseo</i>, <i>ansin</i>, <i>ansiúd</i>, <i>anall</i>, <i>anonn</i>, <i>aduaidh</i>, <i>aneas</i>, <i>anoir</i>, <i>aniar</i>, <i>anuas</i>, <i>aníos</i>, <i>inné</i>, <i>inniu</i>, <i>anocht</i>, <i>amárach</i>, <i>anuraidh</i>, <i>arís</i>, <i>arú</i>, <i>amach</i>, <i>amuigh</i>, <i>isteach</i>, <i>istigh</i>, and probably several more I'm not thinking of right now. Are you active at <a href="../../../../ga/index.html" class="extiw" title="ga:">ga:</a> at all? <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> 15:35, 21 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The reason why I thought <i>seomra</i> is supposed to be pronounced with short <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/o/</span> is because it is (kind of) a recommendation of the Irish People lessons (namely <a href="http://www.leyline.org/cra/languages/IrishPeople/Lesson12.html" class="external text" title="http://www.leyline.org/cra/languages/IrishPeople/Lesson12.html" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, but they do mention it's only true "in parts of Ireland").</dd>
<dd>I'll have to study more about the color/height concepts—I've never seen sounds explained in those terms—and it looks like they may be quite useful in my studies.</dd>
<dd>Also, thanks for the extensive list of the <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ə/</span>-adverbs. While I knew most of them, I didn't know them all, knew a couple of them wrong, and never thought of putting <i>abhaile</i> in the same row.</dd>
<dd>As for the ga:, no, I'm not really active, although <a href="../../../../ga/c/o/n/Speisialta%7EContributions_Ag_Foghlaim_9c53.html" class="extiw" title="ga:Speisialta:Contributions/Ag_Foghlaim">present</a>. I'm planning to increase my participation there as my Irish progresses, but that probably won't be for another year or so. For now, I'm just using the articles as study materials, tracking a few discussions, and adding interwikis when I see that an article I am reading lacks them. Nothing too grandiose&#160;:)--<a href="../../../a/g/_/User%7EAg_Foghlaim_ee64.html" title="User:Ag Foghlaim">Ag Foghlaim</a> 16:10, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Vowels have always been described in terms of <a href="../../../v/o/w/Vowel_height.html" title="Vowel height">height</a>, <a href="../../../v/o/w/Vowel_backness.html" title="Vowel backness">frontness/backness</a>, and <a href="../../../r/o/u/Roundedness.html" title="Roundedness">lip rounding</a>.

<dd>You are right, of course. "Color" is what threw me off; I was aware of the height, frontness/backness, and roundedness concepts.</dd>
<dd>By the way, I forgot to ask you this. Evertype gave pronunciations of <i>bheinn</i> and <i>bhínn</i> as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/vejŋ/</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/vi:ɲ/</span>. I am sure it was a simple oversight on his part, but just to make sure--all consonants in these two words are supposed to be palatalized, aren't they?--<a href="../../../a/g/_/User%7EAg_Foghlaim_ee64.html" title="User:Ag Foghlaim">Ag Foghlaim</a> 19:39, 22 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes. In fact, before front vowels like that, it would be difficult <i>not</i> to palatalize the /v/ sounds. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> 04:56, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Aside from the (in my opinion) oversized template, there is absolutely zero-point-zero content in Roermond/rewrite that is not in the main artcile (<a href="../../../r/o/e/Roermond.html" title="Roermond">Roermond</a>), and quite a bit of info in the main article that is not in the "rewrite". They even have identical spelling errors.</p>
<p>Would you please either move this article to your userspace or (more likely) tag it as an AfD article for deletion?</p>

<dd>What does this have to do with me? I made one minor edit to that article a year ago. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> 06:24, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Eeeek. Please accept my humblest and most abject apologies. I clicked the wrong link, and am now suitably mortified and embarassed. --<a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELing.Nut_3c51.html" title="User:Ling.Nut">Ling.Nut</a> 22:22, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Gosh I'm rusty! "newydda" sounds very informal, I think you'd need at least an apostrophe on the end. "Ni" at the end of the sentence, anyway. I don't think I've ever worked out comparatives for "newydd" before - possibly newydd, newyddaf, newyddach / new, newer, newest, but it just doesn't look right to me. I'd probably go more for somethng like "Ein testunau diweddarach ni", "our most recent articles". What do you think? -- <a href="../../../a/r/w/User%7EArwel_Parry_70fd.html" title="User:Arwel Parry">Arwel</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/w/User_talk%7EArwel_Parry_e253.html" title="User talk:Arwel Parry">talk</a>) 19:42, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
