<dd>Ahlan wa sahlan angrynight. I'm also glad that there is someone who writes on the Arab world, and on Arab literature. Are you familiar with Classical Arabic? I would love to have some questions about the dialect answered. For example, is the letter ج pronounced geem or jeem? Most Yemenis including myself pronounce it as geem and I believe that every other Arabic group(except the Egyptians) pronounce it as jeem. Anyway, I would appreciate your response. --<a href="../../../i/n/a/User%7EInahet_e93c.html" title="User:Inahet">Inahet</a> 07:34, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Assalamu alaikum, thanks for responding. Popular opinion is that Yemeni Arabic is the closest to classical Arabic see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Yemeni_Arabic" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Yemeni_Arabic" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. It's perhaps true, because the most common Yemeni dialect still retains most (if not all) the proper pronounciations of the Arabic letter of old. Yemenis still say qaf, ghain, dhaad, dhaa, while these letters are pronounced quite differently in other Arabic dialects. I, however, was unsure of the letter geem or jeem. And when I say classical Arabic I mean the Arabic of the Qur'an, and of the time and the place of the Prophet (PBUH). That is the reason why I asked. Also, there must be only one pronounciation of the letter geem in classical Arabic, so if you know please tell me.--<a href="../../../i/n/a/User%7EInahet_e93c.html" title="User:Inahet">Inahet</a> 01:30, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I know why I confused you. I forget to acknowledge that there were other Arabic dialects aside from the Quraishi Arabic that existed in pre-Islamic times. Thank you for making that clarification, it seems that I know less of Arabic than I thought. So I guess when say that Yemeni Arabic is the closest to Classical Arabic, they actually mean the classical Yemeni dialect?? Maybe? Also, this is for my personal curiousity, so please there is no need to do any research, I don't want to trouble you.</dd>

<p>Hi, As I know from various credible English dictionaries "Ghoul" is originally Persian still I'm not quite sure about it but it seems to be true because it exists in various <a href="../../../p/a/h/Pahlavi.html" title="Pahlavi">Pahlavi</a> texts much before Arab invasion of Iran.

<p>Have a look at rationale for fair use for how this fair use stuff works.</p>
<p>As long as</p>
<ul>
<li>the image is used in an article about the subject of the image</li>
<li>an approporiate tag, like {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EPromotional_2e75.html" title="Template:Promotional">promotional</a>}}, is on the image description page with source information</li>

<p>Hello, I saw that you are a native speaker of Arabic, so I would like to ask you if you could take a look at <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_invasion_of_Iraq_768c.html" title="2003 invasion of Iraq">2003 invasion of Iraq</a> and <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq_War_58f4.html" title="Iraq War">Iraq War</a>. There is a featured article in Arabic which we would like to know how it could be used the English one which is of course dominated by people who have either been there as soldiers or have their knowledge from western media. Someone also asked if the section about "related propaganda and phrases" could be amplified with information about the Iraqi side. Maybe there are also people who took photos in Iraq at the Arabic version? <a href="../../../n/a/m/User%7ENameme_d48f.html" title="User:Nameme">Nameme</a> 14:43, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can and will translate the article somtime in the next several days and post the translation in the talk page of the english article. I glanced over it real quick and it doesn't seem to suffer from systemic bias. Don't underestimate the value of US soldiers who were there though, there are plenty who can discuss aspects of the invasion which I doubt the Arabic article goes over since there weren't too many Arabs with the US forces when they invaded. I know one ex-army interrogator who naturally knows more about US army interrogation policy than most. I'll have you know bias pisses me the hell off no matter who it's from and I will strip any POV that I can see from the translation before posting. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngrynight_be7e.html" title="User:Angrynight">Angrynight</a> 15:52, 2 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We started a proposal <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiethics_d174.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiethics">Wikipedia:Wikiethics</a> to state the existing policies coherently and make suggestions on improving the editorial standards in Wiki. I thought you might be interested in contributing to that proposal.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a pro-porn and pro-offense lobby is trying to make this proposal a failure. They unilaterally started an approval poll although almost no one including me believe that it is time for a vote, simply because the policy is not ready. It is not even written completely.</p>
<p>Editors who thinks that it needs to be improved rather than killed by an unfair poll at the beginning of the proposal, started another poll ('Do we really need a poll at this stage?') at the same time. The poll is vandalized for a while but it is stable now. A NO vote on this ('Do we really need a poll now?') poll will strengthen the position of the editors who are willing to improve the policy further.</p>
<p>If you have concerns about the ethics and editorial standards in Wiki, please visit the page <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiethics_d174.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiethics">Wikipedia:Wikiethics</a> with your suggestions on the policy. We have two subpages: Arguments and Sections. You might want to consider reviewing these pages as well...</p>

<p>Salam,</p>
<p>Dude! is everything alright with you? How does a cute penguin confirm their image of a violent arab? Have you looked at your own username? And you are NOT the last straw. What you have seen on my talk page is because i refused to accept the fact that many scientists were persians, but rather arab like <a href="../../../g/e/b/Geber.html" title="Geber">Geber</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/h/Alhazen.html" title="Alhazen">Alhazen</a>, etc. Its non of my business, but unlike you whose main interest is in Islam; nearly all my contributions<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Jidan" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Jidan" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> were in the field of Arab science, science, or Yemeni related stuff. If you wanted to promote a nation or a civilization like the islamic civilization, than the best way is showing what they have produced in SCIENCE!!</p>
<p>Regarding yemeni related stuff, me and user <a href="../../../i/n/a/User%7EInahet_e93c.html" title="User:Inahet">Inahet</a> are the ONLY users who have bothered to improve yemeni-related articles. It will be realy nice if you also did something about it, instead of beeing concerned about silly nonsense stuff like a penguin picture on MY talk page. Anyway, I removed the Picture. <a href="../../../j/i/d/User%7EJidan_3a52.html" title="User:Jidan">Jidan</a> 13:14, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

My name is Salman and I have been editing articles in wikipedia for a while. I have been through all different kinds of things at wikipedia; see my talk page for more details. Others wikipedians and I also believe that I have improved a lot since the first time I started editing at wikipedia. I would like an opportunity to become an administrator at wikipedia because even though I have posted “I am willing to help whoever is looking for help in their work”, I haven’t been offered for help.

<li><b>Moral Support</b> Might I suggest withdrawing from this RfA, for if the oppose votes pile up, I'd hate to have you become jaded with the project and leave, as you seem to be a valuable contributor. Perhaps take a look at some recent RfA candidates who have succeeded in becoming admins to get a feel of what the community is looking for in a potential administrator. If you wait a while and get a better handle on what an admin is all about, I'm sure you'll see most of the oppose votes turn into supporting votes at a later date. <font color="#008000"><span style="cursor: w-resize"><b>hoopydink</b></span></font><sup>Conas tá tú?</sup> 02:26, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Dear candidate, thank you for offering to serve Wikipedia in this capacity. Please take the time to answer a few generic questions to provide guidance for voters:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</b> What sysop chores, if any, would you anticipate helping with? Please check out <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_backlog_317c.html" title="Category:Wikipedia backlog">Category:Wikipedia backlog</a>, and read the page about <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators_37b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators">administrators</a> and the <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_reading_list_6f0f.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' reading list">administrators' reading list</a>.
<dl>
<dd><b>A: I highly contributed to the Islamic pages at wikipedia, since they are very likely read these days by everyone. I wanted to make sure that the Islamic pages contain only Islamic information in a neutral way. I am going to continue editing at wikipedia for as long as possible.</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>2.</b> Of your articles or contributions to Wikipedia, are there any about which you are particularly pleased, and why?
<dl>
<dd><b>A: Well, I am really pleased with all most each and every article that had been written in detail by wikipedians. Whenever I need help with school work I always come to wikipedia for guidance and information about my project. I am very pleased with most of the articles written fully in wikipedia. The only thing I don’t like about wikipedia is that there are so many wikipedians around and there are still some articles that are incomplete so I am willing to contribute to the articles that are incomplete.</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>3.</b> Have you been in any conflicts over editing in the past or do you feel other users have caused you stress? How have you dealt with it and how will you deal with it in the future?
<dl>
<dd><b>A: Yes I have been, not a lot of times though. Recently I have been accused by our friend <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">Grenavitar</a> for violating the copyright rules of wikipedia and he blocked me from editing articles on wikipedia.

<p>Hi. I wonder if you wouldn't mind taking a look at the article above, and expanding it further, or especially <i>adding any sources appropriate for our English Wikipedia</i>. I've already built it from a one-sentence stub using the sum total of my knowledge on the subject. Specifically, someone raised questions about the etymology of Semitic definite articles that I just couldn't answer. This has been addressed, but the explanation and other statements really need sources to back them up! So I'm trying to recruit other Wikipedians with Arabic/linguistic expertise, such as yourself.

The image description page currently specifies that the image is non-free and may only be used on Wikipedia under a <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">claim of fair use</a>. However, the image is currently <a href="../../../o/_/_/WP%7EO_c91c.html" title="WP:O">orphaned</a>, meaning that it is not used in any articles on Wikipedia. If the image was previously in an article, please go to the article and see why it was removed. <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">You may add it back</a> if you think that that will be useful. However, please note that images for which a replacement could be created are not acceptable under fair use (see <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html#Policy" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">our fair use policy</a>).</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other unlicensed media, please check whether they're used in any articles or not. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angrynight_d57b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angrynight">my contributions</a>" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting "Image" from the dropdown box. Note that any fair use images not used in any <b>articles</b> will be deleted after seven days, as described on <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html#Images.2FMedia" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">criteria for speedy deletion</a>.
