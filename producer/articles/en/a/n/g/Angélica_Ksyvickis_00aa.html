	    <p><b>Angélica Ksyvickis</b> (born on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_30.html" title="November 30">November 30</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a> in <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santo_Andr%C3%A9_5402.html" title="Santo André">Santo André</a>, <a href="../../../s/%C3%A3/o/S%C3%A3o_Paulo_23d2.html" title="São Paulo">São Paulo</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazil.html" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>) is a <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazilian.html" title="Brazilian">Brazilian</a> <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_show.html" title="Television show">television show</a> host, <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singer.html" title="Singer">singer</a> and <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actress.html" title="Actress">actress</a>.</p>
<p>Angélica started her carreer at 4, when she won a contest to chose Brazil's most beautiful children at the popular variety show hosted by Chacrinha. At 13, she became famous when she replaced <a href="../../../x/u/x/Xuxa.html" title="Xuxa">Xuxa</a> as the host of the kids show Clube da Criança. Her popularity exploded when her hit single Vou de Taxi (remake of Joe le Taxi, by french singer <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanessa_Paradis_0325.html" title="Vanessa Paradis">Vanessa Paradis</a>) topped the brazilian charts. Vou de Taxi became a classic song and is remember by pratically the whole brazilian population even after more than 20 years since the release of the song. She also starred on the popular mini-serie <a href="../../../o/_/g/O_Guarani_b92a.html" title="O Guarani">O Guarani</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a>, she signed with the second most popular channel in Brazil, <a href="../../../s/b/t/SBT_dd19.html" title="SBT">SBT</a> and started presenting the kids variety show Casa da Angelica (Angelica's House), which was a big hit. Her popularity was bigger than ever and she also hosted popular teen game show Passa ou Repassa and TV Animal.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a> she signed a milionaire contract with media-giant <a href="../../../g/l/o/Globo.html" title="Globo">Globo</a> and started hosting her own show, Angel Mix every weekday morning, which was followed by Caça Talentos (Talent Hunter), a soap opera starred by her. The ratings were huge and she became even bigger than <a href="../../../x/u/x/Xuxa.html" title="Xuxa">Xuxa</a>, being the first time any TV female host had surpassed her in popularity. Sales of her merchandising and CDs were huge.</p>
<p>But soon, after the initial boom, the ratings begin to decline and she changed the format of the show several times. While in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a> Angélica was unbeatable among kids, in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a> she lost popularity to <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chiquititas.html" title="Chiquititas">Chiquititas</a> (that year, Angélica album sold 300,000 copies against 800,000 copies by the Chiquititas cast), but she was still very popular untill 1999. In 1998, she had 250 products with her name and made more money than <a href="../../../x/u/x/Xuxa.html" title="Xuxa">Xuxa</a> in licensing (the Angelica shoes by Grendene sold over 1 million pairs in 5 months; in the same period her cereal sold over 7 million boxes and her nailpolish sold 4 million). The sucess of her products were even more remarkable because unlike Eliana (3rd on the list) and Gugu (4th), she didn't promoted her product-line during her show.</p>
<p>Finally, she decided to end her carreer as a child show host and, with only three monts for her contract with Globo to end, she was chose as the host for Video Game, a five minutes segment on celebrity news show Video Show. Video Game was a game-show were two celebrities would compete against each other during the whole week. The segment made the Video Show rating double and what was suppose to be a 2001 summer-only 5 minute segment became a 20 minutes block (half of the show) which is still aired and still has big ratings every afternoon.</p>
<p>The success of Video Show made Angélica popularity climb a lot again and she was soon starring in lots of advertising campaign and appearing in magazine covers. She also hosted the first two seasons of Fama, brazilian version of <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operacion_Triunfo_7800.html" title="Operacion Triunfo">Operacion Triunfo</a>.</p>
<p>In 2003 her relationship with fellow host <a href="../../../l/u/c/Luciano_Huck_271d.html" title="Luciano Huck">Luciano Huck</a> became the biggest celebrity news of the year (they had already dated before) and after their marriage, they become the country favorite couple, starring in lots of advertising campaigns. They had a son, Joaquim, in 2005.</p>
<p>Since her well-received return to television hosting Video Show, <a href="../../../g/l/o/Globo.html" title="Globo">Globo</a> started to plan projects for her, but her own show finally started in April 2006. Estrelas (Stars) is a show where Angelica interview stars and show their intimacy (house, hobbies, etc). The show is the leader on it's time-slot and it's aired every Saturday after Caldeirão do Huck, her husband show.</p>

<p>Angelica had her first acting role on the succeful mini-series O Guarani at Manchete. During the late 80s and early 90s, she had roles in several <a href="../../../o/s/_/Os_Trapalh%C3%B5es_d7bc.html" title="Os Trapalhões">Os Trapalhões</a> movies (Os Trapalhões movies are always huge hits).</p>
<p>She returned to acting in 1998, she had a starring role in Simão, o Fantasma Trapalhão, Didi's (Os Trapalhões leader) movie and starred in her own movie, Zoando na TV. Both movies were very well-received by the public.</p>
<p>In 2004, Angelica was again one of the biggest TV hosts in Brazil thanks to Video Game popularity and Globo decided to release another movie with her in the leading role but the teen-oriented movie Um Show de Verão (which she starred with real life boyfriend Luciano Huck) didn't achieve the expected results, in part because it was PG-14.</p>
<p>In 1996, she starred on kids drama show Caça Talentos, which was aired daily after Angel Mix. While the show was a huge hit in the beginning, ratings soon started to decline and in 1999 it was replaced by Fada Bela, where she played a fairy. The show wasn't succeful either and was replaced by Bambulua, where she played a super-hero, which again, wasn't succeful.</p>
<p>At the end of 1996, at the peak of her popularity, she starred in a special and highly-promoted live special of popular sitcom Saí de Baixo and in 2001 she had a recurring role on soap opera Un Anjo Caiu do Céu, where she played an angel called Angelina.</p>

<p>After going to Globo and becoming a big star, the media became obsessed about Angélica: during the late-90s, they discussed her virginity (because, at the time, she only had two boyfriends) and her relationships with Marcio Garcia, Mauricio Manieri (who his drugs problems) and Luciano Hulk.</p>
<p>In 2004, rumours about Angélica and Luciano Hulk being a couple again started and they both declined, but paparazzi pictures of both of them in <a href="../../../a/s/p/Aspen.html" title="Aspen">Aspen</a> surfaced and ended at Contigo! cover. Since them, their marriage, the born of their first son and their vacations were all acompanied by gossip magazines.</p>
