<p>Well, don't be his tool and get in the middle. Don't take my side either. Take Wikipedia's side and that of professional historians, university professors. I'm just repeating what I have read and seen in books, or online. If he wants "his article" to obey his perceptions, then the article will stay limited forever. There is contemporary evidence of the Norse-Gaels' contributions to society and it is not "locked in the past", so to speak. I bet this editor would not object to the perpetuation of this ethnic stereotype in Scotch, Manx, Irish or Faroese lands. I daresay that he may be an ethnocentric bigot who can't agree with a "cohesive Celto-Germanic community" that includes <b>England</b>, begging the question on whether he is a Scottish nationalist. Wikipedia is a place to recite knowledge, not push POV agendas. <a href="../../../i/p/_/User%7EIP_Address_b0c3.html" title="User:IP Address">IP Address</a> 22:22, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm not trying to push any points in the article, just on the talk page in order to clarify the supposed ignorance of the other user and his newfound pal who enjoy mocking me. Why is there an objection to Richmondshire? The Bretons destroyed or corrupted the original framework and made it into their own, but please read up on the history of Richmondshire and its original people pre-1066. This district was exactly the same as shown on maps for the Norse-Gaels settling there! How is that so hard to understand? The Quakerism via Albion's Seed was merely to point out that not all traces of it died out with the Bretons or Normans. Surely, Richmond is a cultural backwater today. When there were Vikings who took over the Anglian district of Gilling...did Winchester give a rat's arse? The answer is that there is a convoluted set of circumstances which have blurred the region. I told somebody from Newbury in Berkshire that my family's from Wensleydale and she called it a CHEESE! WTF? Don't you see the ignorance I'm faced with? Please, go to school. <a href="../../../i/p/_/User%7EIP_Address_b0c3.html" title="User:IP Address">IP Address</a> 23:08, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The Norwegian colonisation of Northern England was inseparable from the Gaelic syncretism. There is a reason why a king of Norway is called <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnus_Barelegs_7215.html" title="Magnus Barelegs">Magnus Barelegs</a> and if you did more research, you would see the maps and atlases showing the settlement patterns. You would see how York and Dublin had a long process of unity which became fruition under <a href="../../../o/l/a/Olaf_III_Guthfrithson_ae2b.html" title="Olaf III Guthfrithson">Olaf III Guthfrithson</a> and it had an economic as well as social community. Are you stubbornly opposed to works of Oxford University Press, or professional historians of the Viking Age? Don't let present perceptions get in your way of learning <b>how things were</b>. Most people don't know that Norway went on Crusade either, but it happened. Please, educate yourself before judging.

<dd>Angus, would you care to see my newest edition of the Norse-Gaels article? It is more relevant and to the point, than what I composed before. <a href="../../../i/p/_/User%7EIP_Address_b0c3.html" title="User:IP Address">IP Address</a> 19:42, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My referencing the Kessler site was not to draw on the specific data, but to show that a multitude of sources show the same general idea (so, it is not strange) in regards to a Norse-Gael community all around the Irish Sea and its hinterland beyond the shores--as well as the (presently) Scottish Islands. I agree with you, that Kessler takes stances which are based more in approximates than definitives. <a href="../../../i/p/_/User%7EIP_Address_b0c3.html" title="User:IP Address">IP Address</a> 20:11, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, it is not strange to consider this. Such interactions continue to be source of common culture in Northern England today. That is why the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archdiocese_of_Liverpool_dc60.html" title="Archdiocese of Liverpool">Archdiocese of Liverpool</a> exists, for example. <a href="../../../i/p/_/User%7EIP_Address_b0c3.html" title="User:IP Address">IP Address</a> 20:19, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

With respect, I disagree with the view expressed elsewhere on the AfD that a book written in French that has not been translated into English, nor rated any mention anywhere on the internet on English (taking Google as a pretty good proxy for "the internet") can somehow be notable on English Wikipedia. Feel free to add an article to the French Wikipedia, if that is your wont, but as the consensus (which I don't understand you to dispute), even from the author of the article, is that this is "pseudohistory" - i.e., bunk - it seems difficult to divine a possible conceptual reason for notability in English for this article. <a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElectricRay_93ad.html" title="User:ElectricRay">ElectricRay</a> 00:32, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Angus, Yeah, I probably should have stayed out of it. I removed the totally disputed tag and then went back in and added the POV tag as a compromise which is rediculous. Isn't this where King Solomon splits the baby in half. I married an Armenian so I hear about these things. I am considered an "odar"(sp)(outsider) so resolution of this topic has as much chance as Jews and Arabs kissing and making up, imho. I am sure the tags will get switched back and forth a bunch of times today anyways, just watch. Its funny how Wiki's "prime directive" is NPOV but you can't swing a dead cat without finding serious POV edit wars going on in here. Human Beings, go figure&#160;:).

The scoundrel didn't even bother to paraphrase that baloney.--Eupator 17:13, 16 May 2006 (UTC)" and another "So Lucifer, you mean to tell me that in this freedom of speech paradise anyone can go and burn the turkish flag in ankara like we can do here in the US with our flag?

<p>I was actually willing to contact you about this. Please take a look at our history. I have tried so hard to close personal talk with this guy so many so many times. I declared i wont do any personal talk. I have sent him posts in good will to close the talk. he claimed that I am a turk undercover. I said I am not Then he just got stuck to a Phd issiue. He claimed that I am a liar. what is that? What it has to do with the topic. Lastly he is in the internet searching my Thesis to find my name. for what? Searching a persons name in a discussion page? <b>This is terorising and harassment!!!</b> he has a history on blaming people of being a stock puppet, Turk undercover, attacker. At least 3 or 4 people heard the same stories from this guy. he is doing that intentional to scare people of this page. and this is not the only page. All pages related to Armenia.</p>
<p>Enough is Enough</p>

<p>by the way just look two paragraphs up to see what I mean. here in your page fadix makes the same claims abut another person <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurobio_0326.html" title="User:Neurobio">Neurobio</a> 13:17, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>so this is hopeless. As you can see i am very new here. I started editing without really reading the guidelines. which is actually a mistake of course. initially I just looked at the "edit" page and copied the signature from other users. then I figured that on the top of each page it is written how to sign. You warned me and then i learned how to sign. the tracks are there that from that day on. I leave a valid sinature. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurobio_0326.html" title="User:Neurobio">neurobio</a> 14:15, 18 May 2006 (UTC) jut like that!</p>
<dl>
<dd>Do you really think that I care about your name or who you are? I told you, the point here is you having lied rather than you being a Turk, or what have you? I will never go as down as to make threats about one user and that you percieved that this was the cases, and this new member posting someones name in the talk page as a counterattack is at the very least suspicious. For a newbie, this 3 or 4 people that heard about the same story, you seem to know so perfectly all those baseless claims against my person circulating. You should be and are of course aware that sock users involved in the Armenian genocide page are abound and that some administrators have already been warned and are aware of the situation, so don't expect any decision against me, for the simple reason that many have been witness of what happened there and that there are as well Turks who are ready to support me, believe it or not. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 15:50, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I actually do not know the name of the lip reader as I am not a member of the Rangers supporters Trust, however I do know that the same lip reader was used by the Daily Record newspaper when they ran a headline about Lorenzo Amoruso racially abusing a player when Rangers played a team in Italy. I have seen the footage and am more surprised at how many people would rather keep this issue completely off this article, on the grounds that the Rangers Supporters Trust is deemed a biased source. --<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKaratekid7_2b23.html" title="User:Karatekid7">Karatekid7</a> 18:34, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Angusmclellan, thanks for your corrections, I will add more and source the rest when I have time. About Lutherian don't worry, he will possibly be blocked indefinitly by the Arbcom, the first to go. Also, I am pretty much sure that he is the one that created MobyPenis and PenisMoby. Well, will see, as I am pretty much sure that the Arbcom will confirm this by a checkusers. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 19:40, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello, you recently voted to delete the article on urbanates, citing that Wikipedia is not a neologism dictionary. I don't mean to try and unduly influence you here, but you should know that while the concept is obscure, the term has been in use for at least 50 years. It's certainly not a neologism, and if that's the basis for your vote, you may want to re-evaluate it. Or not. Just an FYI. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 23:30, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
