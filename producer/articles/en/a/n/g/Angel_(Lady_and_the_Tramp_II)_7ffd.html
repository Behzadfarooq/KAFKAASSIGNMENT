The Junkyard Dogs. From left to right: Francois, Sparky, Scratchy, Buster, Ruby, Angel and Mooch</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Although she is not the first <a href="../../../j/u/n/Junkyard_Dogs_38c3.html" title="Junkyard Dogs">Junkyard Dog</a> Scamp actually <i>sees</i>, Angel is the first Junkyard Dog Scamp actually met. Later, when Scamp escapes from his yard, he finds Angel in a back alley. He tries to impress her by pretending to be a street dog, but his act doesn't doesn't fool her for a minute. She seems to take a liking to him, but does not show it outright and tries to tell him, "Look, you don't belong on the streets. You won't last five minutes out here." Naturally he doesn't listen and follows her back to the Junkyard.</p>
<p>Angel's thoughts concerning Scamp in the Junkyard seem to range between a smug attitude and one of mild attraction. In any event she clearly prefers him over Buster, who suffers under the delusion that Angel is his girl. She, like almost everyone else, is alarmed when Buster suggests sending Scamp into Reggie's Alley, but she is the only one of the pack who shows any concern for him when he is in the alley. Her growing feelings for him are further increased when he risks his life to save her from Reggie and the dogcatcher.</p>
<p>At a park, Itchy recalls the colourful and untrue tale of <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tramp_%28Lady_and_the_Tramp%29_ff1a.html" title="Tramp (Lady and the Tramp)">Tramp</a>, the stray dog that could never be caught. He tells of how Tramp leaped over a waterfall to escape capture and was never seen again. Buster is angered by this and says that Tramp really went off to live the "cushy" house dog life with the "Queen of the Kennel Club Set"- namely <a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_%28Lady_and_the_Tramp%29_32c1.html" title="Lady (Lady and the Tramp)">Lady</a>. Angel tries to defend Tramp's actions, pointing out that Tramp did it out of love, but Buster is in no mood to listen.</p>
<p>Later when Scamp is in the freight yard (ironically where Tramp was first seen in the original movie), wondering why his dad would give up such a great life, Angel finds him, indicating that she may have been following him. It is here that she tells him her deepest secret: her longing for a home. Their discussion is cut short when a train catches them in the middle of a bridge. Angel saves Scamp from being hit by the train, and they end up falling into a river. She believes that he has drowned, and when she finds him alive she inadvertently expresses her feelings for him, causing her to backpedal quickly when he notices.</p>
<p>The two, their love now blossoming, take a walk through the same park that Lady and Tramp visited in the first film. They play with fireflies in the park, following them to the alleyway next to Tony's Italian restaurant. In another reference to the first film, Tony lays out a romantic dinner spaghetti and meatballs, which the puppies wolf down eagerly in contrast to the delicate manner of Lady and Tramp. It was decided by the directors to have fun with the scene as they could not do better than the original film (see Lady and the Tramp).</p>
<p>After the meal the two dogs find themselves in an area Angel calls "Snob Hill", a direct repeat of Tramp's description of the area in the first film. Here Scamp is almost found by Tramp but is able to hide. However, Angel hears that they are looking for Scamp and is shocked to find out Scamp's father is the Tramp. The two dogs see Scamp's family through the window and see how upset they are at Scamp's disappearance.</p>
<p>Scamp and Angel find that they both want what each of them has: Angel desires a family and Scamp desires the life of a stray dog. Angel suggests, similar to Tramp in the first movie, that they don't need any of it and should run away together.</p>
<p>The following day when Buster tells Scamp to steal a chicken from his own family in order to prove his worth as a Junyard Dog, Angel tries to reason with him, but to no avail. She breifly tries to reason with him in the alley during the confrontation between Buster and Tramp, and again in the Junkyard while Scamp is celebrating his newfound freedom. The last of these attempts leads to Scamp accidentally blowing open her secret desire for a home and getting her kicked out of the Junkyard Dogs. Scamp tries to go after her to apologize, but she is too deeply hurt to listen.</p>
<p>Scamp, having lost his collar previously, is picked up by the dogcatcher. Fortunately for him, Angel is passing by, discovers his plight, and runs to get help from Tramp. For her efforts she gets to help in the rescue and witness the scene as father and son are reunited. She is also present when Scamp returns to the Junkyard and gives Buster his comeuppance.</p>
<p>In the end, Angel is accepted into Scamp's family.</p>

<p><sup class="noprint">[<i><a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research"><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag may be based upon unreliable original research." style="white-space: nowrap;">original research?</span></a></i>]</sup></p>
<p>On the outside, Angel seems to be just like any other tough, streetwise street dog. But beneath that pretty-but-tough exterior hides a lonely and troubled heart. Unknown to her fellow <a href="../../../j/u/n/Junkyard_Dogs_38c3.html" title="Junkyard Dogs">Junkyard Dogs</a>, Angel has always wanted a family to live with, and indeed has already had five. Unfortunately it seems she has always been plagued by bad luck in this regard, as she explains to Scamp: “I could never get one (family) to stick. Someone would take me in, and just when I’d start to think, ‘Wow, this is my family’… they’d… move, or, have a new baby, or have an allergy… same old story, I’m out on the street.” Considering her own experiences, it is hardly surprising that she repeatedly urges Scamp to go back to his own family, insisting that he doesn’t belong on the streets.</p>
<p>She is hesitant to forgive Scamp after he accidentally blows her cover and gets her kicked out of the Junkyard Dogs. But when she discovers that he has been captured by the dogcatcher, she wastes no time in fetching help, and takes an active part in his rescue from the pound at the most crucial moment.</p>
<p>Ultimately, when Scamp has safely returned to his home, Angel shyly tries to leave unnoticed, seemingly because she fears having her heart broken again. But with a little encouragement from Scamp, she quickly changes her mind and chooses to stay, having at last found a place to truly call home.</p>

<ul>
<li>Angel’s personality and evident history is similar to that of Rita from the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warner_Bros._b6cc.html" title="Warner Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> show <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animaniacs.html" title="Animaniacs">Animaniacs</a>: both are strays who desperately want a home and have been through a series of homes where they just didn’t fit. To further the connection, Rita’s constant companion Runt is almost as inept on his own as Scamp. On the whole, however, the similarities are probably coincidental.</li>
<li>Angel shares her name with Experiment 624 from <a href="../../../t/h/e/Lilo_and_Stitch%7E_The_Series_b400.html" title="Lilo and Stitch: The Series">Lilo and Stitch: The Series</a>. Incidentally Stitch, whom Experiment 624 initially toys with but ultimately falls for, has destructive tendencies very similar (albeit differently motivated) to Scamp’s.</li>
