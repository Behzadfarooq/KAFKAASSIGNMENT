Mlshanks,first of all, your only reference you previosly stated was a link to an adult sex site. second it was you who "first" removed my posts on this discussion board. It is also you that has been removing content from the artcile that is well referenced. Prostitution in the philipinnes is illegal, and as such, under the terms of the United Nations that makes it "sex slavery". You say no such thing is happening, but would you care to explain the following arrests?...*<a href="http://www.preda.org/archives/2004/r04062801.html" class="external text" title="http://www.preda.org/archives/2004/r04062801.html" rel="nofollow">Inside The Brutal Sex Slavery Trade of Angeles</a></p>

</ul>
<p>As you also well know, the census is false, at no stage did the census include those trapped in sex slavery, nor did it include those from slums or other such things as the homeless. Its a farce. You yourself in your own post have admitted mass prostition in Angeles which is a crime under philipinne law, you admit it is a major center for sex tourists, as such it is valid to raise this in the article on Angeles. Angeles has a major center in child prostition and sex slavery, the references I have posted clearly show that, as such once again, wikipedia has a responsibilty for this to be added as part of the article. Instead of vandalising the article, why don't you let the moderaters make a desision on this. And I have also wrote to them on this matter. I should also point out that figures on child prostitution in Angeles is hard to be exact, because the organized crime that controls sex slavery in Angeles also controls the trade in other parts of the Philipinnes and that the children are shipped all over these places..as such the sex slaves in Angeles are transient, so no exact figure can be arrived at, as such the numbers vary on a daily basis.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/g/Talk%7EAngeles_City_2ca6.html" title="Edit section: Susan Bryce">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Susan Bryce</span></h2>
<p>The article on Angeles City, Pampanga, Philippines and its associated discussion page has been suffering a rash of vandalism by an Australian activist, Susan Bryce, a leftist "muckraker" who insists that this town, known for bars and nightclubs from it's old Clark Air Force Base days is the center of some nefarious sex slavery and murder ring. Not only has she posted a wide variety of unsubstantiated claims, but what little evidence she cites comes from poorly documented or flatly untrustworthy sources.....or items taken wholly out of context or which fail to support her claims. To add insult to injury, she has repeatedly remove the discussion comments of others, to insert her own silliness and insults on the editing page in violation of all Wiki rules and customs.</p>
<p>She repeatably has tried to block insert a nonsense text claiming hundreds of thousands of enslaved women work in and are killed in the brothels of Angeles City, number that do not square with either with census figures or common sense. Yes, there is prostitution in AC. There has been since the US military built the airbase. Doubtless there may be some exploitation of women... And now that the town has found a cash-cow in catering to foreign sex tourists from the US, EU, Japan, and Korea, they've kept it alive in a variety of nightclubs, bars, and hotels that cater to foreign tourists. It however is a government regulated "Grey trade" in that prostitution is mildly illegal (pimping rather more so), but the bar girls (Guest Relations Officers, or GRO's in the local lingo) are required to be licensed and health inspected weekly. And those engaging underage girls risk VERY real jail time or having their business closed down. Some do wind up in forms of debt peonage or having most of their money taken by bar owners and "mama-sans," but that's rather different than Susan's slavery claims. Not pretty, but infinitely better than the real sex slavery going on in Thailand, India, Turkey, and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Some of the nonsense Susan has repeatedly inserted include claims that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A woman or Child is raped or killed on average every six seconds in Angeles.The bodies of these dead women and children are dumped in the fields known as the "Killing Fields of Angeles".<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This would mean that 10 are raped or killed a minute, 600 an hour, 14,400 a day, or a more than 5.25 MILLION a year. Even if that's only one murder for every 99 rapes, that still means more than 50,000 murders a year. That's more murders in one medium-sized town than the Philippines reported in the entire country in the last 5 years. (<a href="http://www.pnp.gov.ph" class="external free" title="http://www.pnp.gov.ph" rel="nofollow">http://www.pnp.gov.ph</a>) The best part... Her cited "source" for this "fact" is an on-line petition SHE WROTE HERSELF. You gotta love that chutzpah!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Altough the exact figure of children held captive in forced prostitution in Angeles is difficult to establish, the figure is estimated at between 40,000 to 100,000.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So either the PI government is grossly wrong in their 2000 census, or between 22% and 37% of the total recorded population of the town are prostituted children!!! Mind you, that on top of her claims of nearly 200,000 ADULT prostitutes... numbers which taken together exceed the total recorded population of the town. Moreover, the article "cited" by Susan doesn't back her claims (see: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/72622.stm" class="external free" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/72622.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/72622.stm</a> ) where the BBC article says: "Mr Siazon said up to 40,000 Filipino children were involved in child prostitution." Not "in Angeles City," but in sum toto. So where does Susan get her additional 60,000 children from? Her fertile imagination? And why exactly is she sure that all Philippine child prostitutes are in Angeles City?</p>
<p><br />
So what can be done to put a stop to this vandalism? --Mlshanks 06:24, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

What remains is still a pretty alarming picture of rich western sex tourists exploiting an awful lot of children. See the UNICEF quote of the Philippines Department of Social Welfare and Development that "anywhere from 60,000 to 600,000 streetchildren are victims of child prostitution" in the Philippines as a whole while Angeles City is regarded as one of the country's top five spots for child prostitution. That doesn't read to me like a nice orderly place where the workers are "licensed and health inspected weekly". <a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPhaedrus86_4bd1.html" title="User:Phaedrus86">Phaedrus86</a> 07:42, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am constantly harrased by vandals on this page that constantly remove any additions i have added to this page on sex slavery in angeles. all additions are properly referenced including references from the United Nations, Britsh Broadcasting Commision, Philipinne Government Senators, Human Rights Organizations, etc.Ok,</p>
<p>I have started to add a section on "Human Slavery and Trafficking in Angeles". This is absolutly essential given the horrors of what is taking place in Angeles today. All the article is well cited from various recognized sources. Mostly I will uses sources from human rights organizations and will be inviting them to add more to the article as well. I will continue to update this article over time.</p>
<p>Whats needed here is a major section on the bruta;l prostitition trade in angeles including facts and figures. Another section is needed on the killing filds of Angeles where the dead bodoes of thousands of women and children killed by the gangs of Angeles are buries. Another section is needed on the corrupt police and government officials who support this shocking illegal prostitution trade.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by [[User:{{{1}}}|{{{1}}}]] ([[User talk:{{{1}}}|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/{{{1}}}|contribs]]).</small></p>

<p>This article on Angeles is total rubbish, Angeles is a city under the control of organized crime. Their operations include prostitution, money laundering, gun running, kidnap, snuff movies, extortion, drugs and a range of other criminal activities. It is estimated by Human Rights workers that the gangs rake in as much as $100 million a month through their criminal activities. I totally dispute this article and suggest changes that reflect the true nature of this brutal city and its shcking prostitution trade that has cost the lives of hundreds of thousands of women and children....susan bryce.</p>

<p>I have lived in Angeles City for more than twenty five years. The statements pertaining to killing fields could possibly have came originally from an an area on Clark AB where the local Aetna's would kill trespassers on Clark with blowguns and leave them. This was discovered when the base had the grass all mowed down. Any statements about child prostitution is extremely invalid as pointed out by another poster. Using lies put out by certain feminist organizations as a reference is totally invalid. Prostitution is illegal in the Philippines and it is not correct to say that Angeles City is filled with Prostitution. What is actually the case is that because the Philippines is a very poor english speaking country, many girls from all over the country have came to Angeles city and work in various clubs where they have a chance to go out with and associate with tourists. No girl is ever required to sleep with any tourist. It is very common as a result for long term relationships and marriages to develop. As a direct result of this, certain feminist organizations are strongly against Angeles City.</p>
<p>As stated recently by the Mayor of Angeles City, anyone calling a girl in Angeles City a whore with out proof will be criminally charged under Philippine law.</p>
<p>We do not want you putting this type of false information out about Angeles City as it will only result in an influx of Pedophiles which we don't want.</p>
<p>Pertaining to the quoted legal case about an Australian pedophile, the individual concerned has been found not guilty by the legal system in the Philippines and using that as a reference is improper.</p>
<p>The statement about the census is way off base. Every shack in the slums is registered with the local barangay for purposes of ownership. While the people living in the slums may not own the land, they own the improvements they make on the land and are very well protected by law.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Daddyo2 (<a href="../../../d/a/d/User_talk%7EDaddyo2_b91e.html" title="User talk:Daddyo2">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Daddyo2_e139.html" title="Special:Contributions/Daddyo2">contribs</a>) 21:44, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>Comment From Susan Bryce, also born in Angeles: I was born in Angeles and spent most of my childhood there. I lived not far from the base, in those days the roads were all dirst, the base was surrounded by razor wire, and thousands of bars providing women and child prostitutes to the military off the base. When the base closed, the government gave an undertaking to the people of Angeles that there would be no more sex slavery, but when Manila mayor took on the organized crime gangs in the ermita area and shut them down, they shifted their operations to angeles, From here they easily paid off corrupt government officials and have grown their sex slavery business to be a multi-billion dollar empire. No matter who you talk to in Angeles, they are sick of this sex slavery trade and what is happening to Filipino children. The churches constantly condemn the sex slavery trade and there are constant protests against what is happening. Pedophiles in angeles are a well oragized and highly financed group that will stop at nothing to keep this dirty business going. One thing they dont want is International attention, as such they want no mention of this sex slavery trade anywhere on the article about angeles<a href="../../../s/u/s/User%7ESusanbryce_e08e.html" title="User:Susanbryce">Susanbryce</a> 13:12, 27 December 2006 (UTC)Susan Bryce, 27 december, 2006.208.52.112.70 14:06, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have removed the sentence: "However, the census is misleading as it did not include the slum areas which may hold up to a population of 300,000. As well the census did not include women and children held captive in the brutal sex slavery trade in Angeles with figures ranging of in excess of 200,000. <a href="http://www.preda.org/archives/research/cpr/stribune060924.html" class="external text" title="http://www.preda.org/archives/research/cpr/stribune060924.html" rel="nofollow">ref</a>" as the reference cited does not have this information.

Here is the link to establish the sources..."Statistics and the State of the Philippines" by Gabriela and "Trafficking in Women and Prostitution in the Asia Pacific" by CATW - Asia Pacific. ....<a href="http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/philippi.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/philippi.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/philippi.htm</a> , if needed I can get both these agencies to contact the moderators directly to verify.</p>

I believe the angeles article should also link to this page on wikipedia about Apple Tours which was involded in the sex tourism in angeles....<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Apple_Oriental_Tours" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Apple_Oriental_Tours" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Apple_Oriental_Tours</a></p>

<p>I feel the section on sex slavery in Angeles should stay, but as the moderators have pointed out, it needs to be sourced and referenced better, and I will do this over the next few days. I feel the link..<a href="http://www.preda.org/archives/research/cpr/stribune060924.html" class="external free" title="http://www.preda.org/archives/research/cpr/stribune060924.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.preda.org/archives/research/cpr/stribune060924.html</a>... should be added to the article to highlight the varying figures on child prostitution in Angeles, with a mention that the trade is transient in that the sex slaves are shifted from different parts of the country, and very often trafficked to other countries....if you need a source on that ill get one. As i said, im new here, but if the mods can guide me, ill get back with the referenced spources to establish the article....</p>

<dd>First, you have not actually provided the sources for "Statistics and the State of the Philippines" by Gabriela and "Trafficking in Women and Prostitution in the Asia Pacific" by CATW - Asia Pacific, you have only provided a link that cites them. But from that link, it is apparent that those two sources are between 10 and 15 years old, and may not even be relevant anymore. Furthermore, the page you cited does not support the two statements (which I have removed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Angeles_City&amp;diff=96805114&amp;oldid=96771900" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Angeles_City&amp;diff=96805114&amp;oldid=96771900" rel="nofollow">here</a>). It does not say anything about the Yakuza being in <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angeles_City_7ada.html" title="Angeles City">Angeles City</a>, and it only mentions one case of a police officer assaulting anyone in Angeles. While this could possibly go in the article (although I don't think it is noteworthy), it is <i>not</i> the same as "many police officers and government officials are involved in the sex slavery trade and also have sexually assaulted or exploited girls".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Apple_Oriental_Tours_5dfc.html" title="Big Apple Oriental Tours">Big Apple Oriental Tours</a>, I have added a note on how Angeles City was a destination during the 90's, but I have seen nothing to indicate that it is still ongoing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The last link you have given would <i>maybe</i> be acceptable as further reading, but as it is a news article written to persuade, and gives no sources, I would not think it is acceptable as a valid source. It should definitely not be added to "highlight" anything, as it is not <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a>. If you can get proper sources for those statements, we can see about putting them into the article, but for the moment, they should stay where they are. -- <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESir_Escher_d410.html" title="User:Sir Escher">Sir Escher</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../s/i/r/User_talk%7ESir_Escher_9c8c.html" title="User talk:Sir Escher">talk</a></small></sup> 21:50, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The more I look at this article, and the sources "supporting" the section on human slavery and trafficking, the more I think this whole section should be removed, and a paragraph added to the history section about how in the 90's, Angeles City was a common destination for sex tours, and how many of the prostitutes were children. Most of the information I have been given pertains more to the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippines.html" title="Philippines">Philippines</a> than to Angeles City specifically, and is being taken out of context to defame the city. I would like the opinions of other editors on this, if anyone is following this. -- <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESir_Escher_d410.html" title="User:Sir Escher">Sir Escher</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../s/i/r/User_talk%7ESir_Escher_9c8c.html" title="User talk:Sir Escher">talk</a></small></sup> 22:04, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree. We could reduce that information down to a paragraph or so, with citations, but to actually have a larger section devoted to this we need more (and more recent) verification than provided. -- <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKesh_2f01.html" title="User:Kesh">Kesh</a> 22:12, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While Mlshanks removing the notes from the article and placing them here (below) was ill advised, given the current discussion and the state it left the article in, I accept the move for the time being. The consensus seems to be to permanently remove that section, and instead add a paragraph to the history section. -- <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESir_Escher_d410.html" title="User:Sir Escher">Sir Escher</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../s/i/r/User_talk%7ESir_Escher_9c8c.html" title="User talk:Sir Escher">talk</a></small></sup> 12:48, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For the new paragraph to replace the removed notes on the sex trade industry, I propose the following text. It can be cited properly once the wording is agreed upon. Note that it is only a draft, and should <i>not</i> be put on the article page until it is agreed upon and cited properly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the early <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>, Angeles City was known as a "Sex Capital" with tourists traveling to the city to visit <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prostitution.html" title="Prostitution">sex workers</a>, many of whom were underage. It was said that there were "sex tours" operating within Angeles City at the time, climaxing in a tour organization, <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Apple_Oriental_Tours_5dfc.html" title="Big Apple Oriental Tours">Big Apple Oriental Tours</a>, being charged in <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_federal_courts_1479.html" title="United States federal courts">United States court</a> with supporting the prostitution industry, though the allegations were never proven. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a> there was a police crackdown to clean up the nightclubs in the city. Little has been documented about the sex industry in Angeles City since that time, which may imply that the cleanup was successful.</p>

<p>Additional problematic text removed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>, it was estimated that of the 500 <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prostitution.html" title="Prostitution">sex workers</a> in Angeles City, 75% were children.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only is this material dated,; but it is mis-characterized, as the original article does not seem to apply to all of Angeles City's adult entertainment industry (which includes many MORE than 500 sex workers, albeit almost none under 18) but rather a specific area of town since cleaned up by the local government. see: <a href="http://www.sexwork.com/philippines/legalprost.html" class="external free" title="http://www.sexwork.com/philippines/legalprost.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sexwork.com/philippines/legalprost.html</a></p>

</blockquote>
<p>As above, dated material... (same source) No evidence of current issue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The United States, "State Department watch list of Asia Pacific countries", has placed the Philippines on the "Tier 2 Watch List". The report stated that the Philippine government did "not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking." <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>The quote does not directly address Angeles City...and while *dubiously* relevant to the article on the nation of the Philippines, is pretty much a "guilt by association" red herring.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the mid <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>, Angeles City was a popular destination for <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Apple_Oriental_Tours_5dfc.html" title="Big Apple Oriental Tours">Big Apple Oriental Tours</a>, where customers could "select [their] companion upon arrival in Angeles City.” <sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem is, this implies that Big Apple Oriental Tours was in some way involved in "Human slavery and trafficking in Angeles," which has NEVER been demonstrated. Quite the contrary, when NY state twice attempted to charge the business with "promoting prostitution," the charges were twice dismissed.

<p>One main problem with most of the reports about underage entertainers is the fact that the average Filippina looks about ten years younger a girl her age in the States or Europe. No girl is allowed to work without a Mayors Permit. To obtain a mayors permit it must be proven via the National Statistics Office in Manila that the individual is actually of legal age. Very stringent controls are established to ensure that no underage children are working in the various entertainment business's in Angeles. Oddly enough, a lot of girls enjoy pulling the customers leg so to speak and like to lead him to believe they are younger than they really are. It is a shame that reporters arrive here in Angeles City and believe everything they are told without actually researching the true facts of ages etc. One way that will usually let you know the true age of a girl is by talking about her children and how old they are. Then all of a sudden when you find out that the girl has children eight years old and up you realize that she is definately a lot older than 18. Daddyo2 16:19, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would like to bring the moderators attention to the following article..only 8 weeks old...Sunday Tribune Investigation September 24, 2006 By John Burke, Eoghan Rice ....<a href="http://www.preda.org/archives/research/cpr/stribune060924.html" class="external free" title="http://www.preda.org/archives/research/cpr/stribune060924.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.preda.org/archives/research/cpr/stribune060924.html</a></p>
<p>This artcile clearly shows sex slavery and child prostitution is still happening in Angeles and is in fact growing!</p>
<p>Or this article, Sex Tourism Is Big Money for Pimps and Politicians by Fr. Shay Cullen Thursday, Mar. 03, 2005 ....<a href="http://qc.indymedia.org/news/2005/03/2736.php" class="external free" title="http://qc.indymedia.org/news/2005/03/2736.php" rel="nofollow">http://qc.indymedia.org/news/2005/03/2736.php</a></p>
<p>Now, lets look at an article by The Government of Australia and Australian Law Reform Commission.... <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/alrc/publications/reform/reform67/ALRCR67CONFRONTINGSEXUALE.html" class="external free" title="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/alrc/publications/reform/reform67/ALRCR67CONFRONTINGSEXUALE.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/alrc/publications/reform/reform67/ALRCR67CONFRONTINGSEXUALE.html</a> This article states: ". When the Manila local government attempted to close down the sex industry in central Manila, many of the businesses moved to Angeles", now this supports my opinion that the article on Angeles history should show how the sex slavery trade moved from Manila to Angeles after the base was closed. Two: "Filipino population would regularly use the services of prostituted women and children. This is in addition to the masses of male tourists that flock to this growing international sex-capital."..Now, you notice how it says "growing"&#160;! This supports my claim that Angeles is getting worse for sex slavery. Three: "Girls are quickly forced into prostitution". Now, if you are "Forced" then that is sex slavery! that is a crime!. Four: the article also states, "Corruption in the police force and among politicians is reported to be prevalent". Now this is the Australian Government and the Australian Law Reform Commission saying this!</p>
<p>Also, the article on Angeles should include its history, as such the history section Must include a section on the sex slavery industry during the 90`s after the military base pullout. With that said, it should also include a section on sex slavery during the military base lease.....<a href="http://www.catw-ap.org/pros.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.catw-ap.org/pros.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.catw-ap.org/pros.htm</a> , now if you read this article, it clearly states, "WEDPRO found that of the total number of those in prostitution in Angeles City, 70 percent were in prostitution well before they were 18 years old".</p>
<p>I would also like to direct the moderators to look at the following article from "2003"...not the 90`s...which once again as the above article clearly shows the ongoing continuation of sex slavery in Angeles... <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/09/14/1063478066604.html" class="external free" title="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/09/14/1063478066604.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/09/14/1063478066604.html</a></p>

<p>Now, i was in Angeles battling the sex slavery trade at this time, when the base closed a clear indication was given by the government that the sex slavery trade would be shut down. But, when former Mayor of Manila closed down the sex slavery trade in Ermita, the organized crime shiften their operations to Angeles. As such, as part of the history section, it should show how the sex slavery trade was re-established after the base close, and in fact a more brutal way.</p>
<p>And if the moderators on a side note want to know why its so difficult to put forward my case, have a look at what happens here in the Philippines to human rights workers...<a href="http://www.gabnet.org/campaigns/mediawatch/2006/ms04052006.html" class="external free" title="http://www.gabnet.org/campaigns/mediawatch/2006/ms04052006.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gabnet.org/campaigns/mediawatch/2006/ms04052006.html</a> , i myself have been shot, stabbed, assaulted, see dozens of my co-workrs kiiled, threatened, paid off, I see major news networks afraid to write about Angeles because they live in fear of being bombed, killed, or having their family killed.</p>
<p>I feel i have clearly shown that there has been a massive ongoing sex slavery trade in Angeles through the many links i have posted. Iwill contact several Human Rights organizations and ask them to join in on this discussion, especially to provide current details, such as the 8 week old article above. I ask the moderators to continue this discussion and keep an open mind while I request Internation Welfare Agencies to join this talk. thanking you for your kind co-operation<a href="../../../s/u/s/User%7ESusanbryce_e08e.html" title="User:Susanbryce">Susanbryce</a> 12:49, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Susanbryce</b>, I've taken the liberty of moving your above comment into its own section, so it can get individual attention. If this is a problem, please let me know, or feel free to move it back to its original position. I think this deserves to be in its own section though, so everyone can see your latest contribution and discuss it.</dd>
<dd>Currently, I lack the time to investigate your links, but I want to review them and see how well they support your assertions. It may be several days (perhaps a week) before I have the time to really sit down and work on this, but I'm interested in reviewing your work here to see what information it provides us.</dd>
<dd>I would also encourage other editors to review this in the meantime and contribute their ideas here, so we can come to a consensus on how to address this topic in the main article from a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>. -- <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKesh_2f01.html" title="User:Kesh">Kesh</a> 04:39, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>ThankYou Kesh, I appreciate your taking my contibutions seriously and taking the time for this ,matter to be discussed. Also, I was thinking Kesh, do you think in fact it might be a good idea for a new seperate page to be set up on sex slavery in Angeles, with a link from the angeles page to a new page on sex slavery in Angeles? I would also like to trace the history of sex slavery in Angeles from the when it first appeared during the Clark Air Military base, to when it and clark were destroyed during mount Pinatubo explosion, then how the trade re=established itself back in Angeles from Manila. How it has grown since then, what actions have been taken against it, include links to welfare agencies in Angeles battling the sex slavery trade, information on HIV in Angeles, rapes, death toll, etc. If I look around Wiki, I notice a lot of pages that deal with this on their own, and I feel maybe this is the best idea here. For the record, I dont want this to be a personal attack or in any way, but, with that said, sex slavery is a major and the most dopminant part of life in Angeles, and it must be a part of the history and current history of Angeles and be dealt with in wikipedia. In the meantime, I will continue adding links and information to support my case here, thankyou....<a href="../../../s/u/s/User%7ESusanbryce_e08e.html" title="User:Susanbryce">Susanbryce</a> 14:46, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Now, I also want to go back to that absurd census figure of 267,788 people in Angeles. When we look at the above links, we see a range of figures but forward on child prostition with figures as high as 300,000 child prostitutes in Angeles. These figures directly provide proof that the census is a complete farce and I request that some addition should be made that shows that the census in inacurite and in dispute because it fails to include those women and children held prisoner in the sex slavery and human trafficking trade.<a href="../../../s/u/s/User%7ESusanbryce_e08e.html" title="User:Susanbryce">Susanbryce</a> 13:56, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

In adding this suggested section to Angeles on sex slavery, I suggest it be titled:</p>

<p>Im also going to suggest it includes the following sentence...."Angeles is regarded as one of the most desperate areas in the world for child prostition.

<p>Jack444 Most of this talk about sex slavery and child prostitution in Angeles City seems to be propaganda and a gross distortion. I have been to several cities in the Philippines including Angeles City.</p>
<p>These are my firsthand observations of Angeles City:</p>
<p>1) All the bargirls I talked with are willingly employed as a bargirl. Some of them like their job and others only do it for the money. Bargirls tend to tell customers stories to elicit sympathy in order to get bigger tips (my father is sick, the caribou died…). If a girl was being held against her will, a large percentage of the Western tourists would spirit her away and give her money to get home. 2) A bargirl can leave the bar and go home at any time. Their free time is unsupervised and they can come and go as they wish. Bargirls are frequently seen at the local mall before/after work shopping. If a girl saved her paycheck and tips… she could afford a bus ticket home in a few days. 3) The Angeles police enforce the regulation requiring all bar employees (bartenders, greeters, dancers, and guest relations officers) be 18 or older. Bars that fail to obey this regulation have been shut down and the owners and or supervisors jailed. 4) Foreign owned bars are professionally run and meticulously ensure all employees are over 18 years old. 5) A bargirl can refuse the advances of a customer (the girls are not even required to talk to a customer if they do not wish). 6) Most of the bargirls earn substantially more in a bar than alternative employment pays. 7) It is not unusual for a bargirl and a customer to form a relationship and setup house… or get married. 8) Almost all of the bargirls own cell phones and could call home, call a friendly customer, or the police at any time for help. 9) Tourists caught with underage girls (freelancers who hang around side streets near the “entertainment district”) are usually arrested by the police. 10) I have never seen a bargirl with a bruise or such injury. 11) I have never seen or heard of a 6 year-old prostitute as claimed in one of the articles above.</p>
<p>Other comments: 1) Voluntarily employed prostitutes who are free to come and go as they please cannot be categorized as “sex slaves”. Have some respect for the definition of the word slave. 2) Feminist organizations, activist, and charities are selling something just like any other business. Do you believe everything a salesman tells you? Think for yourself and read critically. 3) When feminists or activists do not get the response they like, they tend to start exaggerating and fabricating… just like any desperate salesman.

<dd>Everything you've posted, Jack, is personal experience which is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. We can't use that in determining what goes into the article. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to review those links on Monday, so it'll be longer before I can determine what information Susan provided would fit into the article.</dd>
<dd>I'm a neutral party who is only interested in helping resolve this dispute over the inclusion of "sex slavery" information in the article. Believe me, I'm going to be cautious about what (if anything) about this subject is integrated to the article.

<p>Kesh - thanks for looking at what I wrote. My comments about how organizations and interested parties behave was not intended to be disparaging, it was just common sense recognition of human and organizational behavior. If General Motors is not selling cars because competitors have a better product, they will hype various advertisements and bend the truth in order to entice (trick) customers into showrooms. You will never hear Exxon say they do not want to sell you more gas, and you will never hear the United Way say “everything is okay and we do not need anymore donations”. Organizations are a lot like living entities and will do a wide variety of things in order to grow and flourish. Keep in mind while you are doing your evaluations, that the organizations publishing negative information about Angeles City have a vested interest in problems existing. These organizations trying to attract donations – and horror stories attract more donations.</p>
<p>Various organizations cannot stand the fact that women are voluntarily seeking employment as prostitutes and men are voluntarily purchasing these services.</p>
<p>Now about the facts: The Salvation Army article posted above claims there are 150,000 prostitutes working in Angeles City. Another part of the article said prostitutes are forced to see 100 customers a week.</p>
<p>I looked at the official provincial website of Pampanga, under the “People” pull-down menu (<a href="http://www.pampangacapitol.com/pampanga.html" class="external free" title="http://www.pampangacapitol.com/pampanga.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pampangacapitol.com/pampanga.html</a>) and they say the population of Angeles City is 280,000 people. How can a mid-sized industrial city with a diverse economy including manufacturing, agriculture, food processing, and tourism have 150,000 prostitutes? Furthermore, the tourist bar district in Angeles City is not very big and located on one strip Field/Perimeter. If there were 100 bars located there (an estimate on the high-side), each bar would need to employ 1,500 prostitutes, which is physically impossible even if they had three shifts per day because the average bar is not very big.</p>
<p>Let’s do some simple arithmetic to get a feel for the numbers claimed by the Salvation Army: 150,000 prostitutes x 100 customers serviced per week = 15,000,000 customer visits per week. Assuming a middle-aged man can have sex 2 times per day (which is a generous estimate), or 14 times per week on average, you would need 1,071,429 sex tourists patronizing Angeles City on any given week to keep that number of prostitutes employed at the claimed workload. Now let’s assume the average tourist takes a two week vacation; that would give us a tourist turnover of 26 = (52 weeks in a year divided by 2 week vacations). Now for the grand total number of tourists needed to validate the Salvation Army’s “facts”… 1.07 million tourists with a turnover factor of 26 which gives us 27,857,143 tourists.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at the tourism statistics from the Philippine government website (<a href="http://www.tourism.gov.ph/dot/downloads.asp?file=summarybyprovince2.XLS" class="external free" title="http://www.tourism.gov.ph/dot/downloads.asp?file=summarybyprovince2.XLS" rel="nofollow">http://www.tourism.gov.ph/dot/downloads.asp?file=summarybyprovince2.XLS</a>). In 2005 584,778 foreign tourists visited the Philippines in total, and 76,133 visited the entire province of Pampaga. In the unlikely event every tourist visiting Pampanga went to Angeles City and visited the girlie bars, we would have a gap of 27,781,010 tourists. Based on my quick analysis, at best, the Salvation Army “facts” are off by a factor of 366.</p>
<p>For the Salvation Army numbers to fit the number of available tourists, the average tourist would be required to have sex 5,123 times per week (15 million customer visits divided by 2,928 available customers). The available tourist figure was arrived at by dividing the total number of tourists visiting Pampanga by the turnover rate of 26 (76,133/26).</p>
<p>Another way to look at the numbers is to take the total number of tourists per year visiting Pampanga (assuming they all go to Angeles for the girlie bars, which is not likely) and divide by the two week average vacation and this will give us 76,133 / (52/2) = 2,928 available tourists at any given time. Now if we take the total number of prostitutes claimed by the Salvation Army to be working in Angeles and divide that by the number of available tourists we get (150,000 prostitutes divided by 2,928 available customers) = 51. This means there is a ratio of 51 prostitutes to each customer. Assuming the average customer hires two prostitutes a day, which is overly generous, the maximum possible available tourists would only hire 41,748 girls per week (2,982 x 14). These simple arithmetic calculations show that even when we push the numbers (all tourists in Pampanga go to the girlie bars in Angeles, and each tourist hires two girls a day), the Salvation Army claims simply do not work because the average prostitute would only be hired once every 3.6 weeks (150,000 / 41,748). How could a prostitute earn a living if she only works once a month? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Jack 4444 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jack_4444_03c3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jack 4444">contribs</a>) 00:57, January 21, 2007 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>The customers of the sex slavery trade in Angeles are both Foreign and local. According to Wikipedia there are over 80 million people living in the Philippines of which I would assume there are at least 20 million adult males....<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines</a> , also the Foreigners in the Philippines are there not just only on tourist visas, but also there on residency visas, retirement visas, business visas, investment visas, work visas, etc, as such none of the foreigners on these visas are included in the tourist figures.<a href="../../../s/u/s/User%7ESusanbryce_e08e.html" title="User:Susanbryce">Susanbryce</a> 13:02, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>A short paragraph in the History section referring to prostitution in Angeles City has been deleted twice in the last 24 hours by anonymous user 210.4.102.229. This deletion is unwarranted. The <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balibago.html" title="Balibago">Balibago</a> area has long been known as the red-light district of Angeles city, so the fact that prostitution occurs there is no secret. The extent of child prostitution and human trafficking is less well publicized, but in my opinion deserves to be. The facts are well documented and are, again in my opinion, difficult to refute. I think it should remain included in the Angeles City article.</p>
<p>It is impolite to delete material without discussion. If repeated it is regarded as vandalism, and if deletions persist can result in the editor being blocked. I would much rather it doesn't come to that.

<p>It seems that any factual presentation of the tourist areas in Angeles City is hampered by the rules that wiki runs on. No Original Research means that even though I have 2 decades of experience in the Philippines, my knowledge is useless on wiki. Verifiability is next to impossible in regards to a subject that almost nobody cares to officially document. I'd like to know how we can have a useful article that is not blown up with sensational OMG "facts" such as Susan Bryce likes to give us.</p>
<p>I personally just walked down Fields Ave in Angeles City less than 2 hours ago from lunch, and didn't see a single bar guarded by armed men or surrounded by razor wire. Generally, shotgun and sub-machinegun armed men are only on the streets during martial law. Been a long time since that happened in Philippines. The local police also put out armed officers on street corners when military exercises bring in hundreds of foreign troops. That is also a rare occurrence.</p>
<p>But damn, the above is personally observed things and worthless to us isn't it? What now? <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorwinSF_b073.html" title="User:CorwinSF">CorwinSF</a> 07:03, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>It's absolutely horrible to say that one of the main industries in Angeles City remains prostitution. I have lived in this city for 30 years and I've seen how the city rose from ashes after the Pinatubo eruption and it's so unfair to say this statement. I'm honest to say that there's only one area in this city called "Fields Avenue" where prostitution is rampant but hey, this is just one stretch of a street so <b>no one can generally state that prostitution indeed remains an industry here</b>. We know the fact that there's prostitution in every city in the Philippines so let's be fair in adding this statement as it is destroys the city's reputation of doing it's best to maintain the economic status it's now enjoying. Please do come to the city and observe and by then, you can compare how prostitution can be worse elsewhere. 75.180.219.137 21:51, 21 March 2007 (UTC) FairGuy<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_75.180.219.137_5578.html" title="Special:Contributions/75.180.219.137">75.180.219.137</a> (<a href="../../../7/5/2E/User_talk%7E75.180.219.137.html" title="User talk:75.180.219.137">talk</a>) 21:49, 21 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>Every city has prostitution, indeed. To say that Angeles is a center of prostitution is a hyperbolic statement. One needs to live in this booming city before anyone can make a horrific statement as such. Let's stop generalizing this as the city is bigger than what anyone thinks and to stigmatize is such a biased thing to do. Why not go to Pasay, Cebu, Mindoro, Laguna and other key cities in the Philippines and by there, you'll discover that prostitution can even be worse elsewhere in the Philippines. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_75.180.219.137_5578.html" title="Special:Contributions/75.180.219.137">75.180.219.137</a> (<a href="../../../7/5/2E/User_talk%7E75.180.219.137.html" title="User talk:75.180.219.137">talk</a>) 02:15, 30 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>Everyone has the right to make write-ups regarding one town or city but have they lived in the city where I lived for 30 years??? Do reside in the city first before you come up with an impartial judgment. The problem with the media is that they're creating a media hype trying to exaggerrate things and the only bottom point is to destroy the good reputation the city is trying to maintain to finally eliminate the bad impression people may have on it.</p>

<p>What you up to putting back the said paragraph. You merely rely on the negative things you hear about the city. Prostitution in the city is just situated along one short stretch of street here we call "Fields Avenue" and this we call the red-light district. Funny thing is this area is less than a percent of the entire city. To put a generalized statement that Angeles City is a center of prostitution is exaggerrated, horrible and biased. Please be fair enough to this entry just as you have in your entries in the key cities of the Philippines like Pasay, Cebu, Manila, Laguna and Olongapo where prostitution is also rampant. 75.180.219.137 FairGuy</p>

<p>But then again, would you regard that all documentations in either the form of an article in a newspaper or features on television for real? These are just blown out of proportion. 260,000 people live in this thriving city and I assure you that 99.9% of these don't work in the category you call "prostitution." In fact but no offense meant, bar-girls working here come from Cebu, Bicol and Ilocos regions in the Philippines and what you're adding up in this entry only goes to show how narrow-minded people can be to draw quick judgment on this city. You're only trying to make it appear that the city is doomed and immoral.

<p>Id like to suggest to the moderators an additional section to be added to the article on Angeles. Angeles has enourmous problems and massive human rights violations as we already know from the sex slavery and human trafficking and organized crime. But another major issue in the city that is also gaining international attention is children in jail in the city.

<p>ANGELES DISTRICT JAIL, PAMPANGA PROVINCE</p>
<p>GENERAL CONDITIONS FOR MINORS</p>
<p>- Minors in Angeles Jail are detained in a small (3 meters by 7 meters approx) unventilated concrete cell. There is no window in the cell, and the minors have no access to an electric fan which many of the adult cells have and which is necessary in the constant oppressive heat.</p>
<p>- The minor's cell is in a block containing over a hundred convicted adult prisoners. During the day there is free access for all prisoners (including the minors) to mix freely throughout the block.</p>
<p>- The same cell is always used to house male minors regardless of the number in the jail. Reports from adult inmates indicate that the same cell was used for up to 15 minors at a time. The maximum the Preda Jail Monitoring Team has seen in the cell is eight minors.</p>
<p>- There is no bedding or basic sanitary items supplied by the jail. There is a separated concrete cubicle in the corner of the cell with a toilet. The children are not given any change of clothes, and commonly wear rags.</p>
<p>- Recently there have been reports of a Hepatitis and TB epidemic in the Jail.</p>
<p>- The children have a maximum one-hour a day of exercise. They have to request this each day. They can then have access to a small basketball hoop in the yard. The minors are allowed five hours a day to walk freely around the adult block, and mingle freely with the convicted adult detainees.</p>
<p>- There is no mental stimuli of any kind provided for the children.</p>
<p>- The food budget per child/per day is 30 Pesos (equivalent to US .55 Cents a day). The children Preda talked to reported being underfed and hungry.</p>
<p>- There is little effort made to rehabilitate the minors who report visits from a social worker on average less than once a month.</p>

<p>According to the information submitted to the Working Group by the source, Manuel Flores (10 years of age) and Felix Cusipag (12 years of age) have been detained at Angeles District Jail, Angeles City, for two months without charges, legal counsel or any regard for their legal rights. No arrest warrants were issued at the time of their arrest and no court order was given for their detention.The source further reports that none of these children has been provided with competent legal counsel, as required by Philippine law.</p>

Funny!!! This also happens in other cities in the Philippines. Your're blowing the news out of proportion to make it look like Angeles is indeed a center of prostitution. I hope you get to live in the country, get to see the condition of every city her, open your eyes and then you'd see what my point is. We hope that Wikipedia would be "fair enough" about this.</p>

I advise anyone to inquire at the office of the city mayor to get proof of such an insignificant and false allegation. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_75.180.219.137_5578.html" title="Special:Contributions/75.180.219.137">75.180.219.137</a> (<a href="../../../7/5/2E/User_talk%7E75.180.219.137.html" title="User talk:75.180.219.137">talk</a>) 00:02, 3 April 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
<p>User 75.180.219.137, Stop removing information off the article that you have no right to do. If you do not agree with something, you must first put forward your case here and the Editors will decide, not you! You must support your case with researched facts from reliable sources. You do not own this site or the article, so please obey the rules here. this discussion on sex slavery has been going on for a long time here, and the Editors approved. If you do not agree, then please put forward your case in the discussion area and let the editors decide, and in the meantime stop removing information from the article.<a href="../../../s/u/s/User%7ESusanbryce_e08e.html" title="User:Susanbryce">Susanbryce</a> 05:26, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>If you believe that sex slavery is going on in this thriving city, then why not put the same situation in other entries of cities where prostitution is also rampant? Don't you think that would be fair for everyone. Susan, I've been everywhere in the Philippines and there are much cities far worse than Angeles but have they attempted adding prostitution in their entries? The answer is N-O because it's not gonna help the article at all. I'm a concerned citizen of Angeles and there are a number people doing their means to help alleviate this condition in this city.</p>
<p>Las Vegas is a regarded as the "Sin City" but has it ever been mentioned that prostitution is rampant there? Same with Manila, Pasay and Cebu, was there a topic in their entries to tell more of it?</p>

First of all, the following statement.... Since the early days of Clark Air Base, Angeles City has become <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_trafficking_in_Angeles_City_a7f1.html" title="Human trafficking in Angeles City">known</a> as a centre for <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prostitution.html" title="Prostitution">prostitution</a>. This industry increased greatly after the end of World War II.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>....was originally put there by the Editor, not me, see above. It was put there after extensive discussion on this subject, see above. If you dont agree, then argue your case here instead of just removing the information. Second, why are you talking about las vegas, manila, etc. this is an article on Angeles. Third, why remove the section on "children in jail", this is not connected to the sex slavery trade, it is a different issue, well cited, and has every right to be there. If you believe it to be wrong, then cite your evidence here! why remove the section on welfare groups in angeles, if you believe this to be wrong, then cite your evidence here! Wikipedia is an Encyclopedia, its here to reoprt the facts, not personal opinion, when one looks at Wiki, we notice, it reports on the genodice in Cambodia during pol pot, or the genocide in Uganda during Idi Amin, or the genocide of the Jews during Adolf Hitler, is wikipedia going to remove all that because some people dont agree? Once again, if you dont agree, its up to you to argue your case using well cited sources..something you have failed to do. An ivestigation here states clearly..."The city grew up around the huge US Clark Air Base and, although the base closed in 1992, prostitution is still the only industry in town" <a href="http://www.preda.org/archives/2004/r04062801.html" class="external free" title="http://www.preda.org/archives/2004/r04062801.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.preda.org/archives/2004/r04062801.html</a></p>

I have cited my sources on dozens on times including bbc, united nations, amnesty international, preda, australian government to namr just a few. The editor has already reviewed and approved... here is hios statement from above on the prostitution link.... " A short paragraph in the History section referring to prostitution in Angeles City has been deleted twice in the last 24 hours by anonymous user 210.4.102.229. This deletion is unwarranted. The <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balibago.html" title="Balibago">Balibago</a> area has long been known as the red-light district of Angeles city, so the fact that prostitution occurs there is no secret. The extent of child prostitution and human trafficking is less well publicized, but in my opinion deserves to be. The facts are well documented and are, again in my opinion, difficult to refute. I think it should remain included in the Angeles City article.</p>
<p>It is impolite to delete material without discussion. If repeated it is regarded as vandalism, and if deletions persist can result in the editor being blocked. I would much rather it doesn't come to that.

Thanking you kindly for your reply Addhoc, im sorry, i think what happened was that sources were originally there, but in the continued debate, with things being constantly added and removed, some sources were not correctly readded. Im always happy to discuss this subject in a friendly manner and arrive at a consensus of opinion here, something which I thought we had previously been done. With that said, im always happy to find a middle ground, kind regards, Susan Bryce.<a href="../../../s/u/s/User%7ESusanbryce_e08e.html" title="User:Susanbryce">Susanbryce</a> 14:35, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>What we're disputing here is the prostitution in Angeles, which just like in any other progressive city, is rampant. OK let's agree upon that it be added. But then, another entry about children in jail is being added. It is insignificant. Why are you guys trying to mess this entry up? It used to be not included before. Even if there's a link to this, why do we have to place it when, in fact, being a citizen of this city, I'm not even aware of it. Please be considerate and fair enough as we, the people of Angeles, are truly affected by this news which is somehow fabricated and exaggerrated. It destroys the city's reputation of fighting prostitution. I hope that when you add something nasty, you add something what good the city offers as well. Be impartial enough to do so. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_75.180.219.137_5578.html" title="Special:Contributions/75.180.219.137">75.180.219.137</a> (<a href="../../../7/5/2E/User_talk%7E75.180.219.137.html" title="User talk:75.180.219.137">talk</a>) 23:38, 3 April 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>Well, what I present is not an opinion, it is an "objective and impartial" observation as I have lived in this city since birth. Do you know how it feels when someone you don't know ran into you and tell you "you're a prostitute because you live in Angeles." Respect our city just as you want to be respected the same way. To state that "Angles is a center of prostitution" is demoralizing. But to add another article about jail issue is more than enough to insult and degrade our citizens. Again, what I'm saying here is not a personal opinion and one doesn't have to document it so just to prove you that it's a fact.</p>

<p>It has occured to me that some people are associating the former US military base with prostitution, and in some ways that was true, But, I feel we should also add a section to the article that it created thousands of very good jobs both directly and indirectly, it provided much needed foriegn aid, charity, education, and pumped an enormous amount of money in Angeles, so im thinking ill come up with some citations and hopefully we can look at adding a section on that.<a href="../../../s/u/s/User%7ESusanbryce_e08e.html" title="User:Susanbryce">Susanbryce</a> 13:45, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The topic "children in jail" was added before but then was deleted right away. Now, why add it again? Would it help improve the article? If you're doing this, then do it with other entries as well where prostitution and human traficking is much worse than Angeles. Susan, I just arrived here in the US last month for a vacation. But I was born and still a true-blooded Kapampanga. Stop insulting our constituents. We're doing our best to uplift the economy and lives of the people there.</p>
<p>Ok, im prepared to find some consensus here, ill leave out the children in jail section, BUT, the section on welfare groups MUST stay! no negotiation on that, it has every right to be there, they do a great job under very difficult conditions and they should be appluaded for their work. And i really cannot understand why anyone would want that removed unless they are supporters of child prostitution. The article lists barangays and famous people, so it can certainly list welfare groups and their good work in the community. Now please find some consensus here, in the meantime I also suggest you read the rules on wikipedia, <a href="../../../s/u/s/User%7ESusanbryce_e08e.html" title="User:Susanbryce">Susanbryce</a> 12:44, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I did not get your point why you should point it (welfare groups) again when, in fact, it wasn't here at all prior to the deletion of all absurd sections like children in jail, which obviously is happening (even far worse) around the Philippines. I don't get your thinking as well why you should be giving us (advocates of the city's economy) a condition that should the "welfare groups" be removed, you'll be authorized to put back the section on the "children in jail." I and the rest of the citizens of Angeles are, in every way, in a lose-lose situation as this terribly destroys our dignity. Susan, you don't know what it feels like to be insulted to be given a 'stigma,' especially when the city you live in is being called a sin city. You apparently don't see how we do our best to uplift the lives of the people in our city. Granting that you place the "welfare groups" section back which you feel should be applauded, it would STILL appear that the city is nothing but a prostitute-infested place. You're emphasizing that it's good to know this but in reality, it's not helping us in every way. I hope you'd be sensitive enough to remove this once and for all. It's not used to be in this entry before, so why add it now?</p>
<p>Should we also stay quite about the holocaust? should we stay quite about what pol pot did? should we stay quite every time there is an atrocity in the world? staying quite and saying nothing only serves to prtect the pedophiles and the child sex slavery industry in angeles. we have suffered enough through decades of this atrocity. the city hall is completely under the control of these gangs. the only way this will be shut down is through world media attention, time and time again it is world media attention that has solved the worlds worst attrocities. and every day, right around the world there are more news articles, documenteries and activists exposing the atrocities of Angeles, and that international media coverage is going to get worse, and it will stay there in history, so you would be much better to spend your time writing the the city hall and the president putting pressure on them to shut down the sex slavery in Angeles, because the longer it continues the more worldwide media attention on angeles, and it is you that is doing a diservice to our people. how many more children must be raped and killed while people say nothing. these charities and the work they are doing has saved the lives of thousands! they are the real heros of angeles. they work has been commended all over the world, including nobel peace prize nominations. as the saying goes: "Evil men prosper when good men do nothing".<a href="../../../s/u/s/User%7ESusanbryce_e08e.html" title="User:Susanbryce">Susanbryce</a> 10:28, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Then I commend you for that, Susan. But then again, you need to rephrase them in such a way that it won't look like that Angeles has nothing to offer but prostitution. You didn't say anything good about the city, do you? Now I want you do some research to place the city in good light. I hope it's not too much to ask from us citizens of Angeles. We'll wait for that.</p>

<p>See what I've told you, Susan? People of Angeles would still vehemently deny the one you added because they konow better than you do. You're not a local of the city so to say horrible things about our city is totally absurd and it goes to show how persistent you are to destroy Angeles. Now, if you want people to stop editing this entry, which truly affets us, be SENSITIVE enough to place facts in such a way not to hurt anyone's feelings. So come up with citations or good things to say about our city and adding a section on that would be much much better. Again, we are waiting for that.</p>

<p>What are you up to anyway, Susan? You're not a local resident of Angeles at all. So who cares what you're putting on this entry? Tell us at once what you really want? You seem not to answer a simple question. If all you care is to destroy our city, then let us know at once so we'll shut our mouth once and for all. Please make a clean-up on this entry, otherwise, not only the people of Angeles, but the entire Philippines would hate you for that. Please reply so we'd have a better consensus as to how make this entry much better and beneficial for all.</p>

<p>The only way for this mess to stop will be for the article to be locked ans a third party editor to decide and for everyone to obey the Final descision of that Editor<a href="../../../s/u/s/User%7ESusanbryce_e08e.html" title="User:Susanbryce">Susanbryce</a> 20:57, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, we will stop as long as you stop demoralizing our city, Susan. Let be a good role model then.</p>
