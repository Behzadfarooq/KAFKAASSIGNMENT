<p>Hey Angus, wondering if you know something about Domnall Bán being "Earl of Gowrie"; the claim occurs in many internet sources, but I've never come across it in any proper sources. Seems to me intrinsically unlikely, as Gowrie was the core province of the medieval Scottish kingdom, containing centers such as Scone and Perth. Do you have any idea why this idea exists? The claim is still contained in the wiki article, <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domnall_III_of_Scotland_5f99.html" title="Domnall III of Scotland">Domnall III of Scotland</a>, though it is uncited. I notice this article is one of the few early Scottish kings articles that have not been brought up to proper standards, so I don't take this as a sign of it being correct. Regards, <b><a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalgacus_587c.html" title="User:Calgacus">Calgacus</a> (<i><a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalgacus_321f.html" title="User talk:Calgacus">ΚΑΛΓΑΚΟΣ</a></i>)</b> 14:26, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The only thing of relevance in pp. 164-5 is a citation of himself to p. 156. There he quotes the foundation charter of Scone Abbey where King Alexander grants a portion "of my oats and my bere and of the cain of my hides and cheeses" from, according to Duncan, the king's manors of Gowrie "as much as from my earldom as from my royalty". On page 126 Duncan says "Ethelred and Alexander were invested in the earldoms of Fife and Gowrie respectively", but gives no evidence. Bannerman ("Macduff of Fife") has since shown that Ethelred was not earl of Fife, and as you say Duncan has now changed his mind about Gowrie. What strikes me is that if Gowrie were a mormaerdom, the Scottish king would have no desmesne land in Scotland-proper that wasn't part of another historically attested comital province, excepting the Mearns, which is very far north, appears to have been a royal forest and was a mormaerdom in the reigns of Domnall III and Donnchad II. He doesn't seem to say anything about Gowrie in the reign of Domnall, so I think I'll just have to assume for now that someone writing between Bower and those Victorian amateur peerage historians made it up. <b><a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalgacus_587c.html" title="User:Calgacus">Calgacus</a> (<i><a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalgacus_321f.html" title="User talk:Calgacus">ΚΑΛΓΑΚΟΣ</a></i>)</b> 04:25, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Wouldn't mind writing that article on Domnall Bán, but don't feel I should without having access to Duncan's <i>Kingship of the Scots</i>.

<p>I don't really have any thoughts except on the first, which I've wondered about previously. I would favor "of Deira", except that it doesn't tell the reader that he ruled Bernicia as well; "of Northumbria" lets us know that he ruled both, even though the term itself may be an uncomfortably fitting anachronism. "Of Northumbria" seems to be a simple and clear way to identify all the kings who ruled both the components of the territory during the period, same with Aethelfrith and Oswald, for instance. I don't have a strong feeling about it, but in the past I've favored the "of Northumbria" designation. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 00:04, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Regarding your suggestion <a href="../../../d/b/u/User_talk%7EDbuckner_Expert_rebellion_ca73.html" title="User talk:Dbuckner/Expert rebellion">here</a> that rcp be listed, as you'll probably know the outburst linked seems to have been sparked by <a href="../../../j/o/h/Talk%7EJohn_MacDonald_II%2C_Lord_of_the_Isles_7591.html#Prose" title="Talk:John MacDonald II, Lord of the Isles">this disagreement</a>. As shown in the section below that, I hope as a first step to improve the tag concerned. It was undoubtedly applied with the best of intentions, but has contributed to the loss of a prickly editor who had contributed a considerable amount of work of excellent basic quality, even though much is sorely in need of copyediting.

<p>On 3 September 2006 you tagged the article <a href="../../../a/n/e/Anecdotal_cognitivism.html" title="Anecdotal cognitivism">Anecdotal cognitivism</a> with <a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENotability_8ef7.html" title="Template:Notability">Template:notability</a> and <a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup_258a.html" title="Template:Cleanup">Template:cleanup</a>. I agree 100% with the clean-up tag. The notability tag is more problematic. The discussion of a scientific term, maybe especially a 19th Century one as this one is, is not within the guidelines enumerated by the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENotability_8ef7.html" title="Template:Notability">Template:notability</a> tag. However inartfully the editor expressed himself/herself, this <i>methodology</i> was the one that <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Darwin_74f3.html" title="Charles Darwin">Darwin</a> employed, as well as <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Romanes_8725.html" title="George Romanes">George Romanes</a> and others, and it is in stark contrast to the <a href="../../../b/e/h/Behaviorism.html" title="Behaviorism">Behaviorism</a> research model that was the predominant one in the XXth Century. I believe that it is important to document the history of science, especially since the pendulum often swings back, a classic example is <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continental_drift.html" title="Continental drift">Continental drift</a>. Are you aware of any guidelines for <a href="../../../h/i/s/Category%7EHistory_of_science_9a0c.html" title="Category:History of science">Category:History of science</a> articles? Unless you object, I will remove the notability tag but keep the clean-up tag. The work of historiographic researchers like Colin Allen, D. Jamieson and M. Bekoff needs to be reviewed, and the connections to modern <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethology.html" title="Ethology">Ethology</a> need to be explored in the literature. No, I am not suggesting original research, just a review of what exists.

<p>Bal o dia ar on obair, a Angus! You're a treasure; its sheer delight on my part to come across such well-written, incisive and deserving articles on Wiki! My health, however, is still not good; frankly I have being suicidal on a number of occasions over the past few months. Yet tomorrow is always a new day.

<p>Nice work on <a href="../../../c/e/r/Cerball_mac_D%C3%BAnlainge_d801.html" title="Cerball mac Dúnlainge">Cerball mac Dúnlainge</a>! Thank you for recommending the O'Corrain article, which I will enjoy reading. I am working on a couple of writing projects surrounding Ragnar and I'm trying to figure out if Thora was Ingjald's wife (and thus Olaf's mother) or his mother (and thus Olaf's grandmother). The text of the Penguin Classics version of <a href="../../../e/y/r/Eyrbyggja_saga.html" title="Eyrbyggja saga">Eyrbyggja saga</a> doesn't agree with the Norse versions available online. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriangotts_9359.html" title="User talk:Briangotts">(Talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Briangotts_3847.html" title="Special:Contributions/Briangotts">(Contrib)</a> 20:58, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for the recent message regarding sources on Death toll of the Enlightenment. Looking over the article, all of the statistics are sourced.

<dd>Perhaps the title of the article is the thing that is problematic - I think it is commonly accepted that a number of modern governments have been genocidal or at least engaged in mass executions of those whom they considered threats. It seems that a catalog of such events is an appropriate article for Wikipedia. I chose the title under the presumption that the most definitive philosophical character of the modern state is its origin in Enlightenment philosophy - which characterizes the modern conception of the state in both its good points and its bad points - I can see how the article could be perceived as an attack on the Enlightenment because it illustrates a negative aspect of it - although I would be the first to agree that there are many positive aspects, as well. It seems as though there might be two ways to go with it - recast the title and introduction as relating to the modern secular state, without focusing as much on the Englightenment, or restricting the examples to governments more immediately associated with the 18th century thinkers - most obviously the French Revolution, reign of terror, etc. - or maybe doing two separate articles - one on each topic. What are your thoughts on that? --<a href="../../../t/b/o/User%7ETbook_a701.html" title="User:Tbook">Tbook</a> 14:58, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I have posted it in user space at <a href="../../../t/b/o/User%7ETbook_Enlightenment_0ad6.html" title="User:Tbook/Enlightenment">User:Tbook/Enlightenment</a> so that we can continue to talk about it.

<p>I am taking these accusations of lack of process for using IRC quite seriously. Whether IRC should or shouldn't be used: the fact is it is used, and not just by me. Instead of debating whether using IRC is against procedure, I've proposed a procedure for when sysops use IRC to listen to Move Requests, which for now I've put on the village pump (policy) page: <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28policy%29_070f.html#Requesting_administrator_assistance_on_IRC" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)">Wikipedia:Village_pump_(policy)#Requesting_administrator_assistance_on_IRC</a>. —<a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPengo_70fc.html" title="User:Pengo">Pengo</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/e/n/User_talk%7EPengo_b6eb.html" title="User talk:Pengo"><i>talk</i></a> · <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pengo_3e19.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pengo"><i>contribs</i></a></sup> 00:44, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
