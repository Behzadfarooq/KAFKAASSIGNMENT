<p>ACS (Barker Road) has had a young but interesting history. The establishment of <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Chinese_School_%28Independent%29_add7.html" title="Anglo-Chinese School (Independent)">Anglo-Chinese School (Independent)</a> in 1988 resulted in the <a href="../../../p/s/l/PSLE_803e.html" title="PSLE">PSLE</a> cut-off score being raised from 200 to 230 points by <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>, tightening admission criteria. This policy resulted in increasing numbers of students being made unable to continue their secondary education in the ACS family. By <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>, over 50% of students from the two ACS primary schools did not meet the criteria, which led to an outcry amongst pupils and parents. The <a href="../../../a/c/s/ACS_Old_Boys%27_Association_78b8.html" title="ACS Old Boys' Association">ACS Old Boys' Association</a> and the Board of Governors were faced with the dilemma of improving education standards against rejecting many from a 10 year education in ACS.</p>
<p>Requests made to the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Ministry_of_Education_%28Singapore%29_c50b.html" title="Ministry of Education (Singapore)">Ministry of Education</a> for the introduction of a second secondary school were turned down. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a>, MOE finally allowed the establishment of a full school to be set up with primary and secondary school sections. This piece of news was met with relief by many parents and Old Boys. The new school would thus be able to provide hope to those who would otherwise be unable to continue education in ACS. ACS (Barker Road) was formally opened in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a> as a full school and was later split up from the primary section in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a> which later became <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Chinese_School_%28Primary%29_ab24.html" title="Anglo-Chinese School (Primary)">Anglo-Chinese School (Primary)</a>. Both schools returned to the Barker Road campus in 2003.</p>
<p>Today, ACS (Barker Road) provides an all-rounded education to its students, with an emphasis on the nurturing of the individual. Firm steps have been taken towards academic excellence, with the school being recognised with value-added awards for three consecutive years. The school has also done particularly well in the sporting arena, having remained in the top 4 placings amongst its niche sports.</p>

<p>The decision was taken in the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990s</a> to redevelop the Barker Road campus as simple renovations were not enough to meet the needs of the new century. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>, ACS (Barker Road) moved out of the campus after a closing ceremony on 4 November. To accommodate an increase in student intake, the campus would be expanded and redeveloped. A contentious issue developed after a controversial plan was undertaken to dismantle the historic clock tower facing Dunearn Road due to safety concerns. This minor conflict was eventually resolved and the dismantling went ahead. A replica now stands 20 metres away from the old clock tower, with the original clock mechanism installed in the new tower.</p>
<p>The 5.2-hectare campus now contains the Primary and Secondary blocks of <a href="../../../a/c/s/ACS_%28Primary%29_2d2e.html" title="ACS (Primary)">ACS (Primary)</a> and ACS (Barker Road) respectively. In between the Primary and Secondary buildings is an Administrative block housing the general office as well as the libraries of both schools. The landscaped, open-air Student Plaza links the three buildings together. The cafeteria, <a href="../../../p/o/p/Popular.html" title="Popular">Popular</a> bookstore, CCA rooms and Music Studios are located one floor below the Plaza. The Arts Centre contains the Mrs Lee Choon Guan Concert Hall, Tan Cheng Siong Drama Theatre and the <a href="../../../l/e/e/Lee_Kong_Chian_3a5e.html" title="Lee Kong Chian">Lee Kong Chian</a> Auditorium which can seat 830, 270 and 1,200 respectively.</p>
<p>The Sports Complex also sits on the campus, which contains the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaw.html" title="Shaw">Shaw</a> Pool, a cafe overlooking the pool deck and the Tan Chin Tuan Sports Hall. The Sports Hall has 3 basketball courts, a racket centre, full recreational facilities including a gym and changing rooms. The Pool has 8-lanes and is Olympic-sized. The Transport Centre/Carpark is located below the Complex, which includes pick-up and drop-off bays as well.</p>
<p>Barker Road Methodist Church and the Methodist Centre (housing the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodist_Church_in_Singapore_b3fd.html" title="Methodist Church in Singapore">Methodist Church in Singapore</a>) have also been relocated to the redeveloped Barker Road campus. ACS Oldham Hall has also been renovated with improved facilities, such as air-conditioning in some rooms, a cafeteria, and the capacity to house 500 boarders. The Barker Road campus was designed by SAA Architects Pte Ltd and the entire project cost was <a href="../../../s/%24/_/S%24.html" title="S$">S$</a>95 million, out of which <a href="../../../s/%24/_/S%24.html" title="S$">S$</a>15 million had to be raised by the school. In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, the campus won the CIDB Award for Construction Excellence.</p>

<p>The performing arts, clubs and societies have taken a fresh approach, and have been active on the national scene. Since 2006, Drama has been earmarked as a niche area for growth in the school, following in the footsteps of <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Chinese_Junior_College_8563.html" title="Anglo-Chinese Junior College">Anglo-Chinese Junior College</a> which has offered the Drama Elective Programme to its students. Media related CCAs have also made a significant impact on a national level. At the 2005 <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore_Youth_Festival_3b90.html" title="Singapore Youth Festival">Singapore Youth Festival</a>, the school was awarded:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drama@ACS (Gold)</li>
<li>Chinese Orchestra (Gold)</li>
<li>Dance@ACS (Silver)</li>
<li>Concert Band (Bronze)</li>
<li>ACS Madrigal Choir (Bronze)</li>

<p>The UYOs have also been an integral part of ACS (Barker Road)'s history, with the Scouts achieving the first Frank Cooper Sands Award in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>. The Boys Brigade, NPCC and NCC (Sea) have since achieved numerous accolades since the school's founding in 1994. These achievements have resulted in the school being awarded the Sustained Achievement Award as well.</p>

<p>Apart from the various CCAs, the school recognises the academic talents in the pool of students. From exploring mysteries of the Sciences, to appreciating the Arts, the school has consistently been doing well in subject competitions. This is especially evident in its Humanities winnings, winning the Gold Award from 2005 to 2006 in Ngee Ann Poly Grand Olympiad Treasure Hunt.</p>

<p>This programme was first introduced in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, with the aim of developing the brightest minds and talents in the school in the Academic and CCA fields. The programme aims to nurture and harness the potential of students in the top 2 classes in Sec 1 to Sec 3, particularly in the areas of Cognitive Development, Talent Development, Social &amp; Personal Development and Leadership Development. Lessons are designed to engage students in problem-solving, independent and self-directed learning. Pupils of these classes have also been given various opportunities to serve in the school or community.</p>
<p>The students in the programme are stretched beyond the regular academic cirriculum as they are expected to become leaders in the society. They are given exposure through the Geography Trip to Germany &amp; Poland and events like the World Expo in Aichi,Japan.</p>
<p>Students who are talented in certain areas are given opportunities to groom their talents by representing the school in various national and international competitions such as Odyssey of the Mind in Colarado,USA and the ACJC Geography &amp; Chemistry Quiz. These students are also given the task of organising the annual school-wide maths fair.</p>

<p>The Arts Education Programme aims to encourage greater appreciation of the different cultures in Singapore and their musical traditions. The programme also aims to develop the school's growing strength in Drama. Drama workshops, dance workshops and viewing of theatrical productions are organized for students to cultivate appreciation in theatre and enable them to acquire a basic understanding of its demands. Performances of different art forms and groups are also organised to expose students to a certain culture.</p>

<p>The programme seeks to nurture independent learning, responsibility and develop life-skills of self-discipline and accountability. Lessons are given online to the student, during which he does not need to come to school. Thus students experience and familiarise themselves with new platforms for learning which are pervasive in institutes of higher education.</p>

<p>The Outdoor Education Programme (OEP) helps to instill values that would not necessarily be taught in the classrooms. The aim of this programme is to therefore inspire students to reach their potential and learn essential lifeskills. As part of this concept, level camps are organised annually. These include:</p>
