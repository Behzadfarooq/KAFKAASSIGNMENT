<p>In its strictest sense <b>Anglo-Indian</b> refers to any tangible or intangible thing with both <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">English</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">Indian</a> provenance or heritage. Though this page discusses a specific community, in the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_world.html" title="Western world">West</a> the term Anglo-Indian is sometimes used in a more general sense to describe people who have <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multiracial.html" title="Multiracial">mixed</a> <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demographics_of_India_eac4.html" title="Demographics of India">Indian</a> and <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_people.html" title="English people">English</a> ancestry.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <b>Anglo-Indian</b> community is a distinct minority community originating in <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> consisting of people of mixed <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">Indian</a> ancestry whose native language is <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a>. Originally, Anglo-Indian's British ancestry is bequeathed <a href="../../../p/a/t/Paternal.html" title="Paternal">paternally</a>. However, in countries such as Canada and England, there has been a large influx of Indian immigrants, starting in the 1960's-1970's. As a result of assimilation, mixed Anglican and Indian backgrounds are becoming more prevalent with Indian ancestry descending from the <a href="../../../p/a/t/Paternal.html" title="Paternal">paternal</a> side.</p>
<p><i>Article 366(2)</i> of the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution_of_India_8f96.html" title="Constitution of India">Indian Constitution</a> defines an Anglo-Indian as "a person whose father or any of whose other male progenitors in the male line is or was of European descent but who is domiciled within the territory of India and is or was born within such territory of parents habitually resident therein and not established there for temporary purposes only".<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> Under this definition, the <a href="../../../m/e/s/Mestizo.html#India" title="Mestizo">mestiços</a> (mixed <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portuguese_people.html" title="Portuguese people">Portuguese</a> and Indian) of <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goa.html" title="Goa">Goa</a> are also included.</p>
<p>Anglo-Indians formed a small portion of the minority community in India before <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_independence.html" title="Indian independence">independence</a>, but today more live outside India than within. The community has historically been concentrated around towns and cities that were important railway terminals, as a large proportion of them worked in the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_Railways_05c3.html" title="Indian Railways">Indian Railways</a> and the postal and telegraph services. Their numbers in India have dwindled significantly as most emigrated to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>, and, to a lesser extent, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Indian_3dd1.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The first use of the term was to describe all British people living in India, regardless of whether they had mixed blood or not. This usage changed to describe Anglo-Indians as people who were of mixed blood descending from the British on the male side and women from the Indian sub-continent - including the countries now known as <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan.html" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangladesh.html" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> - on the female side. Over generations Anglo-Indians intermarried with other Anglo-Indians to form a community that developed a culture of its own. <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Indian_cuisine_4753.html" title="Anglo-Indian cuisine">Anglo-Indian cuisine</a>, dress, speech and religion all served to further segregate Anglo-Indians from the native population. They established a school system focused on <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English language</a> and culture and formed social clubs and associations to run functions like their regular dances at occasions like Christmas and Easter.</p>
<p>Over time Anglo-Indians were specifically recruited into the Customs and Excise, Post and Telegraphs, Forestry Department, The Railways and teaching professions - but they were employed in many other fields as well. A number of factors fostered a strong sense of community among Anglo-Indians. Their English language school system, their Anglocentric culture, and their Christian beliefs in particular helped bind them together.</p>
<p>Originally, under Regulation VIII of <a href="../../../1/8/1/1813.html" title="1813">1813</a>, they were excluded from the British legal system and in Bengal became subject to the rule of Mohammedan law outside Calcutta - and yet found themselves without any caste or status amongst those who were to judge them. In <a href="../../../1/8/2/1821.html" title="1821">1821</a>, a pamphlet entitled "Thoughts on how to better the condition of Indo-Britons" by a "Practical Reformer," was written to promote the removal of prejudices existing in the minds of young <a href="../../../e/u/r/Eurasian_%28mixed_ancestry%29.html" title="Eurasian (mixed ancestry)">Eurasians</a> against engaging in trades. This was followed up by another pamphlet, entitled "An Appeal on behalf of Indo-Britons." Prominent Eurasians in Calcutta formed the "East Indian Committee" with a view to send a petition to the British Parliament for the redress of their grievances. Mr. John William Ricketts, the first noble pioneer in the Eurasian cause, volunteered to proceed to England. His mission was successful, and on his return to India, by way of Madras, he received quite an ovation from his countrymen in that presidency; and was afterwards warmly welcomed in Calcutta, where a report of his mission was read at a public meeting held in the Calcutta Town Hall. In April <a href="../../../1/8/3/1834.html" title="1834">1834</a>, in obedience to an Act of Parliament passed in August <a href="../../../1/8/3/1833.html" title="1833">1833</a>, the Indian Government was forced to grant government jobs to Anglo-Indians.</p>
<p>Since the <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railway.html" title="Railway">railway</a> was first introduced to India, Anglo-Indians were involved with it. This work in a way gave them a specific social niche of their own, since in the traditional Indian <a href="../../../c/a/s/Caste.html" title="Caste">caste</a> system castes were often identified with a particular profession, but evidently there was no caste connected with working on railways.</p>
<p>During the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_independence.html" title="Indian independence">independence movement</a>, many Anglo-Indians identified (or were assumed to identify) with British rule, and, therefore, incurred the distrust and hostility of Indian nationalists. Their position at independence was difficult. They felt a loyalty to a British "home" that most had never seen and where they would gain little social acceptance. (<i><a href="../../../b/h/o/Bhowani_Junction_2cd9.html" title="Bhowani Junction">Bhowani Junction</a></i> touches on the identity crisis faced by Anglo-Indian community during the independence struggle.) They felt insecure in an India that put a premium on participation in the independence movement as a prerequisite for important government positions. Some Anglo-Indians left the country in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a>, hoping to make a new life in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> or elsewhere in the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_of_Nations_38fc.html" title="Commonwealth of Nations">Commonwealth of Nations</a>, such as <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> or <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>. The exodus continued through the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> and by the late <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a> most had left with many of the remaining Anglo-Indians still aspiring to leave.</p>
<p>Like the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parsi.html" title="Parsi">Parsi</a> community, the Anglo-Indians are essentially urban dwellers. Unlike the Parsis, the mass migrations saw more of the better educated and financially secure Anglo-Indians depart for other Commonwealth nations.</p>
<p>There has been a resurgence in celebrating Anglo-Indian culture in the 21st Century, in the form of International Anglo-Indian Reunions and in publishing books on Anglo-Indians. There have been six reunions with the latest being held in Melbourne in 2004. The next reunion is set for August 2007 in Toronto. Among the books on Anglo-Indians recently published include '<b>Anglo-Indians Vanishing remnants of a bygone era'</b> (2002). '<b>Haunting India'</b> (2003) and '<b>Voices on the Verandah'</b> (2004) and '<b>The Way We Were'</b> an Anthology of Anglo-Indian culture published in 2006.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Indian_3dd1.html" title="Edit section: The present community">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The present community</span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution_of_India_8f96.html" title="Constitution of India">Constitutional</a> guarantees of the rights of communities and religious and linguistic minorities permit Anglo-Indians to maintain their own schools and to use English as the medium of instruction. In order to encourage the integration of the community into the larger society, the government stipulates that a certain percentage of the student body come from other Indian communities.</p>
<p>There is no evident official discrimination against Anglo-Indians in terms of current government employment but it's widely perceived that their disinclination to master local languages does not help their employment chances in modern India.</p>
<p>Anglo-Indians distinguished themselves in the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_of_India_a68a.html" title="Military of India">military</a>. <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Vice-Marshal_cb7a.html" title="Air Vice-Marshal">Air Vice-Marshal</a> Maurice Barker was India's first Anglo-Indian Air Marshal. At least seven other Anglo-Indians subsequently reached that post, a notable achievement for a small community. Countless numbers of others have been decorated for military achievements. Air Marshal M.S.D. Wollen is often considered the man who won India's <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a> war fighting alongside <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangladesh.html" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> Anglo-Indians made similarly significant contributions to the Indian Navy and Army.</p>
<p>Another field Anglo-Indians dominated was education. The most respected matriculation qualification in India, the <a href="../../../i/c/s/ICSE_5b99.html" title="ICSE">ICSE</a>, was started and built by some of the community's best known educationists including <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Anthony_065b.html" title="Frank Anthony">Frank Anthony</a>, who served as its president, and A.E.T. Barrow who served as its secretary for the better part of half a century. Most Anglo-Indians, even those without much formal education, find that gaining employment in schools is fairly easy because of their fluency in English.</p>
<p>Several charities have been set up abroad to help the less fortunate in the community in India. Foremost among these is CTR (Calcutta Tiljallah Relief - based in the USA), which has instituted a senior pension scheme, and, provides monthly pensions to over 300 seniors. CTR also provides education to over 200 needy children.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Today, there are an estimated 200,000-400,000 Anglo-Indians living in India, most of whom are based in the cities of <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delhi.html" title="Delhi">Delhi</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calcutta.html" title="Calcutta">Calcutta</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangalore.html" title="Bangalore">Bangalore</a>, and <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bombay.html" title="Bombay">Bombay</a>. Anglo-Indians also live in <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cochin.html" title="Cochin">Cochin</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madras.html" title="Madras">Madras</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goa.html" title="Goa">Goa</a>, <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucknow.html" title="Lucknow">Lucknow</a>, <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agra.html" title="Agra">Agra</a>, and in some towns of <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Bengal_be5b.html" title="West Bengal">West Bengal</a>.</p>
<p>Most of the Anglo-Indians overseas are concentrated in <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_f75d.html" title="USA">USA</a>, and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>. Of the nearly million or so and their descendants who have found safe havens abroad, some are settled in Asia including <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan.html" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> and <a href="../../../m/y/a/Myanmar.html" title="Myanmar">Myanmar</a>, and also in European countries like <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switzerland.html" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>, and <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>. The community in Myanmar frequently intermarried with the local <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Burmese_2fd3.html" title="Anglo-Burmese">Anglo-Burmese</a> community but both communities suffered from adverse discrimination since Burma's military took over the government in the 1960's.</p>
