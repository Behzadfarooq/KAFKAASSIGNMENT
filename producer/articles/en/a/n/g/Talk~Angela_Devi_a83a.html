<p>This may or may not mean a whole lot considering the nature of the internet and the adult entertainment business, but I just noticed something. Angeladevi.com was removed on April 30th like the note on the site originally said it would be, but I just typed it in, and now Angeladevi.com redirects to Foxes.com. What's up with that?</p>

<p>WHY does it still say she is dead on here? Stuff like that is the reason that people say wikipedia is horrible and not trustworthy at ALL. since when do we put up info that hasnt been proven by reliable sources? the sources used for her death are NOT reliable, and this is bogus information. Until it is CONFIRMED thru real arizona police or other means, it should say there is SPECULATION that she is dead, but not saying it as its fact. Please change this, or I will. Sept 25 CQuest</p>
<p><br />
I did some back tracking on the history of this article in wikipedia and noticed some edits were made on April 2th 2006 that stated that Angeladevi.com would not be alowing new memeber to sign up, and will be closing at the end of that month, as it did. I personally saw this around April 10th or so, and wondered what was going on. I looked on Wikipedia, and it stated that she died..but I never saw a death notice on the site. The edits made on April 2nd didn't allude to her death either, however somehow someone was able to get a screen shot of the notice which supposedly appeared on April 1st. A screenshot. That never sat well with me. I find it hard to believe that a message as such would only appear on a site for one day..AND someone would get a screenshot of it, and post it days afterward. This is a load of crap. And someone from Atlanta (ip 70.190.192.183) keeps changing info or vandalizing this page, which to me all adds up to hacker activity all around. This site. Angela's site perhaps. Her myspace page. Her account on freeones. All of it.</p>
<p>So I'm removing her death date until someone shows something otherwise. I will however leave documentation of all the info surrounding the rumors.</p>
<p>that is all.</p>

<p>Siamus, boy ... my memory has never been good, and darn it ... I should remember all about this as I followed it dutifully.</p>
<p>But be assured, that there was a death notice on her site. If my memory does serve me correct, I think it didn't appear until Sunday April 2nd or the following day on Monday the 3rd.</p>
<p>And then yes, it did disappear within a day, 24 hrs. no doubt. This much I remember as well.</p>
<p>What I do forget, is whether the the first message, the one on Saturday April the 1st, had the death notice. I believe I don't remember it that way.</p>
<p>But yes, there was a death notice, and it vanished within 24 hrs. replaced by what I <i>believe</i> to be the orignal notice on Saturday the 1st.</p>
<p>This is a dictionary, and I know we can only post what's verifiable.</p>
<p>Just trying to help ...</p>

<p><br />
Even if there was a death notice, one has to be suspicious. But also, nothing has been verified publicly. You don't say someone is dead for one day and take it offline, unless it was somehow untrue...or if someone is trying to cause confusion purposefully. As I said before..angeladevi.com redirects to foxes.com now. So foxes is still banking off her name. Hello??</p>
<p>But I do realize that this is an encyclopedia, and not a tabloid..which is why I left as much info about all of this intact as I should. My only thing is stating that she is dead without any real public announcement. Can't do it.</p>

<p>I noticed that her measurements read 36DD-23-33 and 91-58-84 cm. That cant be right. According to the cm measurements, if u convert it to inches she measures 36 - 23 - 33 inches and not 36DD. Assuming she has a 24 inch band size her correct bra size would be 30DDD. So in which case her measurements should be 30DDD-23-33. Can anyone clarify this?</p>

<p>Angela died March 31, 2006 right? Now I am sure in all this time, there has to have been a funeral and burial or she had to have been cremated. I looked on findagrave.com, and I used both her real name and stage name yet nothing was found of her. I'm starting to believe Angela is alive and she left the industry. 67.173.101.98 06:03, 23 August 2006 (UTC)BigBoi29</p>

<li>Findagrave.com is hardly a reliable source. On the front page of findagrave.com says you can search 12 million grave records. It also says <a href="http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/ref/abouttx/census.html" class="external text" title="http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/ref/abouttx/census.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> at the webpage of the <a href="http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/" class="external text" title="http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/" rel="nofollow">Texas State Library and Archives Commission</a> that the US census estimate in 1900 was over 76 million. By this point in time, pratically all of the people born in 1900 will be dead and in a grave somewhere. 76 million is a hell of a lot much bigger number than 12 million. Hell, the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/us.html" class="external text" title="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/us.html" rel="nofollow">CIA Factbook</a> says the current mortality rate is 8.26 deaths per 1000 people, so given that the current US population is nearly 300 million people, that means about 2.5 million people each people die and are interred. Twelve million grave records is equal to roughly 5 years worth of deaths in the U.S. <a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabercil_a2ff.html" title="User:Tabercil">Tabercil</a> 17:18, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I've gone through and done some general cleanup again. The entry is not a place for wild theories and speculation. Also, using a picture of her pointing a gun at herself is in pretty poor taste, considering the circumstances surrounding her death. I've reverted back to the old picture. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadratic_e732.html" title="User:Quadratic"><b>f(x)=ax</b></a><sup><a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuadratic_9bf1.html" title="User talk:Quadratic"><b>2</b></a></sup><a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadratic_e732.html" title="User:Quadratic"><b>+bx+c</b></a> 21:39, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am going to put an end to this...Angela Devi (Angela Shanali Dhingra) is not dead.</p>
<p>I have this from a reliable source in the porn and modeling industry, who's name will not be revealed, that Angela Devi is not dead. She retired her name herself and moved on with her life to get married and move into another business venture.</p>
<p>The police report is 1000% FAKE. There was no funeral so this is why no death certificates, obituaries and no reports of her death was found.</p>
<p>I hope this puts to rest all stories of her death.</p>

<p>How credible is Lukeisback.com regarding it's information in general? I know nothing about the guy personally, but can we accept what he posts on his site as "truth". Can the section regarding Angela's death be label as such? I viewed the police reports when they were first posted. They do look real and as far as I can tell the people in it exist, but at the same time..why did this not turn up in a more well known, more reliable source?</p>

<p>Though I'm of the opinion generally that we are looking at a suicide, one sentence in the police report does bother me-- that "Angela saw a Dr. Seuss about the suicide attempt <b>and was prescribed Wellbutrin</b>."</p>

<p>I think that this Police Report is phoney. There are lots of holes in it and all the pages could have easily been made up. Pages 1 and 2 are easily forgeable. The other pages contain a few laughs:</p>
<p><b>Page 3.</b> Officer J Nicholls enters the building and notes in his report that the suicide note was faxed to the family by the police?!!</p>
<p>He says that the two dogs were placed outside, (prior perhaps to Angela committing suicide?)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><b>Page 4.</b> We are to believe that page 4 is valid. It appears to be plain paper, with yet another description of the victim through the eyes of yet another officer. It is entitled DEATH UNDER INVESTIGATON and I could have done this myself. An unknown Officer,</p>
<p>Officer O'Meara</p>
<p>Detective Nichols</p>
<p>Detective Kirkham</p>
<p>We are now up to 5 officers on scene for a reported suicide. Hmmm.</p>
<p>Does W/F mean White Female?</p>
<p>This Officer also mentions a bag with 115 missing Xanax pills and I have to ask myself what state I would be in if I took 115 of these pills? A quick check on this pill and overdosing would cause any of Nervousness, Anxiety, Rage, Euphoria.. would you still have it together to take your life?</p>
<p>But, to add to the authenticity of this page, you simply type CRIME SCENE SPECIALIST SIGNATURE AND ID# and scribble your name and badge number underneath.</p>
<p>To finish it off, you also add SUPERVISOR/REVIEWER SIGNATURE AND ID# and scribble your name and badge number underneath.</p>
<p>I'm sorry. That's not very cop or official.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Page 5.</b> This is from yet another officer. Officer T Koerner, along with recruit Goodson attend.</p>
<p>Now that is seven officers.</p>
<p>Koerner mentions a canine as being heard inside the house. But previously on Page 2, Nichols says that the two dogs were placed ouside?</p>
<p>This report is just not rigorous enough to be a credible police report. This officers mentions all the players by first name!</p>
<p>Someone please tell me why the fire department had to be called? Several firemen checked to make sure she was dead?? LOL!</p>
<p><br />
<b>Page 6.</b> Now another officer, M Yavello, is involved. His behaviour is bizarre. For a possible suicide attempt, he arrives first but decides to wait for another officer to arrive. In the meantime, he parks his "fully marked SPD patrol car" up the street to observe the house!</p>
<p>This report is chatty and tells a story that mentions all the players by first name. Very unprofessional and not at all as clinical as you'd expect a police report to be.</p>
<p>Oddly, this police officer describes Angela as a white female with a dark brown complexion. There isn't a police officer in the world that could describe Angela as white, but two separate officers here do!</p>
<p><b>Page 7.</b> This continuation states that Firemen have the skill to determine that the time of death was approximately 1017. That's Fire Captain A. Bajaras and Firefighters K.Yule and D. Gonzales. Also Medical Experts. It's the background to a cheesey 70's TV programme!</p>
<p><br />
<b>Page 8.</b> Now Angela strikes me as being a bit brighter than this. She wants to do another suicide but doesn't want her best friend or her boyfriend to know. So she asks her best friend how to commit suicide by hanging?? LOL! ROFL!</p>
<p><b>Page 9.</b> A ridiculous sketch of the Living Room. For as long as you have wathced TV cop shows, you see photos taken of the scene. Next, they'll add a picture of a tablet of stone, where Officer Flintstone.F had also recorded the scene.</p>
<p><br />
So that's eight officers and three firemen, for a suicide attempt\suicide. I believe this report is a load of balony. And so I still believe Angela is alive and well.</p>
<p>She wants Out of the business, but as I mentioned before, they've cocked it up. This is their latest attemt to mock up a story of her death. Shame on Lukeisback.com for carrying it but Luke is some kind of Porn afficionado and may have agreed with this stupid idea. It is grossy unfair of her and her advisors to carry on with this deception. The majority of her fans probably would have respected a normal decision to leave the industry. Just change your name and then deny that you are the same girl should anyone recognise you.</p>
<p>I think that the impossibility and the implausibility of Angela Devi dying has driven many to speculate and otherwise try to find out if she is indeed dead. And she probably now has more attention and more of a need to hide, then if she had 'gracefully' left the business.</p>
<p>What do you think? I don't think we should need to verify this rubbish police report. But if somebody can, then the Lieutenant might just be wrong!</p>
<p>Lt Columbo. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by LtColumbo (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_LtColumbo_1678.html" title="Special:Contributions/LtColumbo">contribs</a>) 21:39, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</small></p>
<p><br />
Talk about wild conjecture. While some of the information in the alleged report does seem a bit off or at least slightly odd, many of the criticisms leveled by "Lt. Columbo" are unfounded and inaccurate.</p>
<p>1. To start, the number of officers at the scene is hardly out of line for a suicide call. This is precisely the sort of circumstance where law enforcement officers tend to gather.</p>
<p>2. More than one patrol car is likely to respond, and each car might well have two officers in it.</p>
<p>3. Next, the responding officers will assess the scene -- especially when they do not have easy access to the property.</p>
<p>4. The presence of detectives (additional police) should be a no brainer, as uniformed police officers are not qualified to process any scene involving loss of life without detectives.</p>
<p>5. Also, concerning your criticism of the firefighters on the scene, this is again consistent with the protocol in many cities and suburban environments. In Scottsdale, EMTs are attached to the fire department, and this is who would have been in the rescue vehicle. The captain responding is likely a riding captain -- and firefighters are likely routinely dispatched to this kind of call (suicide and suicide attempt), as they are in most urban and suburban environs in the US.</p>
<p>6. The time of death listed in the report is the time when the paramedics made the determination that the victim was deceased; in other words, they observed no life signs at around 10:17. It does not involve any real expertise, as all that is required at this stage is to consult the EKG, check for pulse, make sure the pupils are fixed and dilated, and to observe the lack of any motion of the body. Given the lividity of the woman and her position, calling the time of death in this kind of instance is more or less a formality.</p>
<p>7. For the record, crime scene sketches are still routinely included as a supplement to photography (and one of the reports mentions that photos were taken as well). Any photographs taken would be included in the non-public version of the report available to law enforcement. Especially in a closed record state such as Arizona, you are not going to recieve anything more than a redacted version of the report. You will note the lack of date of birth, driver's license, and social security information, as well. These are not public information, although the crime itself is.</p>
<p>8. Finally, concerning the description of Angela as a white female, this too is not all that unheard of in parts of America. For record keeping purposes, some law enforcement agencies only differentiate between "white", "black", and "Asian" types. My understanding is that AZ law enforcement also includes "Latino" as a type. If the report was faked, wouldn't it seem more likely that the vict would not be described as "white", as this is a peculiarly "bureaucratic" description for an obviously Indian woman?</p>
<p>You might also be able to determine the validity of the report by using the badge information of the various first responders it includes. If the officers and firefighters (and the CSS mentioned) are real players with the same numbers, this adds to the likelihood that this is a valid police report, albeit a somewhat sloppy one. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.6.223.37 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.6.223.37_1378.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.6.223.37">contribs</a>) 14:17, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

I wrote to Luke about this a couple of days back. What I wrote to him:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Your posting about Angela Devi's death - how good is your information? Reason for this is that I'm monitoring the actress' article on Wikipedia, and there's a fair stream of comments about how she's not dead. What I would like to do is to try and conclusively put the entire issue to bed.</dd>
</dl>
<p>His reply:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The documents are conclusive on her profile on my site.</dd>
</dl>
<p>He stands by this report.</p>
<p>Now to add my two cents to the issue. From what was written, the officers who responded consider this to be a "routine" suicide. Why should they spend extra time and effort doing what is not needed? Expecting them to do anything more beyond the routine would be a case of the <a href="../../../c/s/i/CSI_Effect_6de1.html" title="CSI Effect">CSI Effect</a> at work.</p>
<p>As for these people who consider Angela to still be alive despite a lack of presented evidense to the contrary, I would consider their arguments to be the same as those made that <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elvis_Presley_0230.html#Elvis_lives.3F" title="Elvis Presley">Elvis lives</a>. I mean, what more do they want? Angela Devi might be considered by some to be a notable porn star, but Jane Q Public will see her as just another anonymous woman. - <a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabercil_a2ff.html" title="User:Tabercil">Tabercil</a> 03:23, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
It seems I am not alone in my belief that Angela is not dead, I noticed the exact same things that you did Lt. Columbo. Now this is not speculation or theory or anything, I really do believe Angela Devi is not dead, and that she faked her death to leave the business. I respect the fact that you want to leave the business and move on in your life, but there is something more to this that what is being said and Angela should have done something different.</p>
<p>I spoke on Yahoo messenger with Ahmo Hight who has worked with Angela on Foxes.com. She said on her Yahoo page that Angela was alive and well, but when I talked to her, Ahmo changed her story and said that Angela's photographer Woody (no last name given) confirmed her death. Now, part of me wants to believe that but another part of me is not buying this at all. I truly believe that Angela Devi is alive and everyone is trying to cover the fact that she left the business by saying she is dead.</p>
<p>I'm almost tempted to contact Sylvia Browne on this one. 67.173.101.98 20:51, 30 August 2006 (UTC) BigBoi29</p>

<p>It's not an Elvis thing - with Elvis, there was always a body and always lots of news and evidence that the burger-eating crooner was indeed dead.</p>
<p>Angela Devi had\has a fine body and I have a bit of a penchant for Indian women, but please don't let Mrs Columbo know!</p>
<p>But Angela, for me, at the end of the day, was just a product that got discontinued. But I must respect that she was more to a great many people, including those that actually knew her.</p>
<p><br />
<i>Isn't it odd that for someone that is\was obviously very well known, no one of any credibility has actually delivered any credible information on her death?</i></p>
<p><br />
It all seems to point to all of her friends and family (and perhaps commendably too) clubbing together to try to ensure she leaves the business and trying to ensure she gets to lead a normal life.</p>
<p>For me, it is just the mystery of it all that is very interesting. It always smelled fishy from the start.</p>
<p>With all the discrepancies on every page, with the doubt that I've probably cast on the Police Report and the realisation that this report could easily be mocked up. With your revelation, Tabercil, that lukeisback.com can prove nothing other than the Police Report document is on his website, can I suggest that we at least edit the word Police Report on the Wiki article to "Police Report"? That is, with quotation marks around it until the "Police Report" is in some way verified.</p>
<p>I sincerely doubt that the report could ever be verified and if it does get verified satisfactorily, I'll bring in some of Mrs Columbo's cookies.</p>

<i>I sincerely doubt that the report could ever be verified...</i></p>
<p>On the contrary, the police report could be verified rather easily. All that needs to be done is to contact the Scottsdale PD, provide them with the information in the PDF posted on Luke Ford's site and to request your very own copy of report #06-08603 (along with your check for $5). If the information provided results in a mailed police report from Scottsdale containing the same information, this means the report posted by Mr. Ford is genuine. Of course, this would just prove that one Angela Dhingra committed suicide; there is still the possibility that this Angela is not the same person as Angela Devi.</p>

<p>I found the following news article online regarding obtaining police reports in Scottsdale:</p>
<p>"Police stall on records requests By Mike Sakal, Tribune April 9, 2006</p>
<p>A day after the Scottsdale Police Department said reports would be readily available to the public with the help of new computer software, officials announced a 10-day waiting period for records requests.</p>
<p>A sign on the window of the department’s records office states: “Effective immediately, March 20, 2006. Requests for police reports will be mailed or available for pickup after 10 business days. We thank you for your continued patience.”</p>
<p>Records clerks and Scottsdale police detective Sam Bailey confirmed the new time frame for reports to be released, causing one local private investigator to complain the department is not complying with public records laws.</p>
<p>Arizona public records law says that when someone requests a public record, it must be provided promptly.</p>
<p>“Scottsdale always has been one of the worst in releasing public records, mostly its police department, and they’re getting worse,” said private investigator Rich Robertson of Mesa, a former Phoenix newspaper and television reporter.</p>
<p>Victims can get police reports quicker without having to pay for them, but a records clerk said if someone is arrested, they can’t get their report until they appear in court.</p>
<p>For everyone else, Scottsdale charges $5 for each police report, or 25 cents per page after 30 pages, according to the report request form.</p>
<p>Reports can be requested in person or through the mail at Scottsdale Police Department Records, 8401 E. Indian School Road, Scottsdale, AZ 85251-2855.</p>
<p>Bailey said the processing time for records requests allows records supervisors time to omit Social Security numbers, addresses, telephone numbers and names of other people involved in an incident.</p>
<p>“Our policy was a little lax before on letting people look at the records,” Bailey said.</p>
<p>“We’re being a little more careful about what we’re releasing in reports.”</p>
<p>As residents requested reports at the police department’s records office on Monday, some people were surprised at the new policy.</p>
<p>Les Rist of north Scottsdale requested reports on Monday from a vehicle collision on Jan. 30.</p>
<p>He said he was rear-ended, but was also being cited in connection with hitting the car in front of him.</p>
<p>Rist was told by the clerk he would have to wait 10 days for the reports.</p>
<p>“I think it’s terrible,” Rist said of the wait. “Ridiculous. My insurance company said they had requested the reports (of the accident) from the police department, but haven’t received them yet. I thought I would come down and pick them up and send them to the insurance company myself, but I can’t yet.”</p>
<p>However, Jason Richburg of Chandler, the general manager of Bandera restaurant in downtown Scottsdale, received quick service when he requested reports on Monday from a kitchen fire at the restaurant last month.</p>
<p>Richburg received the reports almost immediately upon request.</p>
<p>“I would be upset if I had to wait 10 days for a report,” Richburg said. “I don’t know about other people. I guess they have to wait longer. . . .”</p>
<p>Contact Mike Sakal by telephone at (480) 970-2324."</p>
<p>So, my suggestion to anyone with doubts is to contact the Scottsdale Police Department directly with the information provided, instead of us all speculating. Somehow I doubt anyone will do it.</p>

<p>Because I want to get to the bottom of this mystery. But I'm in the UK. I'm pretty certain that the Scottsdale PD won't take my cheque or my cash.</p>
<p>Needs somebody in the US to do it for us. Needs somebody trustworthy. Which means a Wikipedian!</p>
<p>I'm certain someone will do it, esp as it's only $5. But we need to agree on how the result from the PD can be 'authenticated' to the rest of us. Is it a photo of the response? Do we ask for two Wikipedians to obtain and then verify the same report or response to us by way of photo?</p>

<p>I read a lot of conspiracy theories online surmising she may have actually faked her death. Do we have any citations that aren't "lukeisback.com", etc.? I mean, real local news sources that reported a death of one Ms. Dhingra??</p>
<p>To answer your question Angela Dhingra's suicide never appeared on The Scottsdale newspapers or the Arizona newspapers nor appear in the obituary. Foxes.com did not cared much to have her pictures up on her website. Nonetheless Foxes.com just shut down everything the moment they learn about Angela's death and Angela's abandonment of taking some days off. Angela Dhingra last login to her myspace on January 24, 2006, in the report Angela moved into her new home in Scottsdale, AZ. Euan Black's house is 2 mintues away from Angela's house. Between those two months she may have planned her suicide either trying to suffocate in the car, bought pills from a undisclosed E-mail spammer or decided to buy a belt when she had everything at home. It is sad that she was all alone on the night of March 30, 2006 that between the hours of dusk 6 p.m. to 9 a.m. when found by the Scottsdale Police Department. So Angela was driven by her family, spirits or the relations of models, photographers and employees at Foxes.com. No evidence of when she was buried or cremated in Arizona or her family's home in Louisiana. Those cops who found her, Scottsdale Police Department only reply "The case is still under investigation".Duskrider 18:33, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

I hope she burns in hell more than she burns on a sickly website, ha aha ha ha. She is a crook with a lot scum in her mouth.</p>
<p>From what I have read of the police report and other pertinent material it seem that it was very possible that this was a case of homocide. We all know that Organise Crime indulge in these activities even at the extent of buying off law enforcement. We all might think that this is something of the past, but we can bet that these activities continues especially in the USA. Only the FBI might be able to give us the truth if they are so inclined. It could have been done by professionals inside the crime organisation or hired by the Crime Organisation. Usually when a girl desires to get out of the business or disagrees with her bosses namely the Organise Crime in Prostitution and such related business, legal or illegal, that the girl will be kill or rather be murdered. Of course, the murders would have been careful not to leave telltale signs or clues, unless the wanted the police to know.</p>
<p>I strongly believe that these cases always have an underlying criminal substratum inspite of what the local police would wrap up. They may see no further reason to investigate further due to political or other restraints; they would have to wrap up the nicely looking case of suicide. Of this the criminals are quite aware. There is always speculation unless there are thorough investigations that upholds the 'Law'. Most of us would agree that the law in not perfect or always perfect. The law is only upheld when it is highly motivated and determined to find nothing less than the truth. One more factor, she was ethnic Indian American woman not "status quo". From a political, sociological and historical points of views such women as Angela Devi may not have warranted the social protection from a 'status quo' law enforment body in predominantly so-called upper or middle class neighbourhood. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.158.103.29_5008.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.158.103.29">69.158.103.29</a> (talk) 08:24, 19 February 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
<p>TO THE PREVIOUS POSTER</p>
<p>Quote: - "Things people would do for money, it seems Angela has conned all of us and is alive. Maybe it would be good if she was really murdered".</p>
<p>1.Where is your proof, circumstancial or otherwise to back up your statement that she is alive?</p>
<p>2. Why then the groundless speculation alleging her murder by a criminal underground?</p>
<p>3.If you are so convinced of your opinion, why do you remain an anonymous poster?</p>
<p>4. Do you have anything significant to contribute other than what amounts to the same "schoolboy detective/conspiracy theory crap" you can read anywhere else?</p>
<p><br />
For the most part, this page has attracted many interesting comments from people who actually knew her (at one time or another) or have a genuine interest in both finding out the truth of her (probable) death and honouring her memory.Unfortunately, you do neither.</p>
<p>In your next post, try and do both you Moron.</p>

<p>Like someone said earlier, Angeladevi.com redirects to Foxes.com, but only after a period of about 3 weeks of just being a link that went nowhere. It's possible that Foxes is just trying to bank off of her name, but to me it looks more like they "own" the name..since Angela's site did mimick the original Foxes.com layout when it was still running. There was also no updates for a long time before that. Of course I can't say for sure that she's alive or not..but it does look like she actually quit.</p>
