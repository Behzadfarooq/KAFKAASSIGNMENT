<p>Summer Hamori is an extrodanarily gifted girl. She is talented in singing and also in liteture. born on September 20th 1993, (time exactly, unknown from 11:00 PM to 11:30 Pm) she was extremely cerebral from the start. She flew by Elementary school with flying colors considering the number of transfers she was forced to endure, and not long after her family moved to Texas where she was forced to tag along. She did not mope for long however for not even two years after she moved there she was noticed for her wonderfully high TAKS scores and allowed to take a college test to see how she would do. She loves to write and spends hours at a time typing up stories and riddles for her friends. When asked if she always liked to make stories she responded with "[Yes, but] I must have started hundreds of books and never got past chapter one! During second grade, however, I learned the importance of completing what one has begun." "She was not always so bright in first grade however," claims some of her friends, "but she was always nice and by second grade she caught up and went beyond expectations. Personally [we] think she was just trying to make up for falling behind in the beginning, but she [certainly] ran the extra ten miles!" Not everyone thinks she is so great though. A young girl who has chosen to remain anoymonous makes some far out claims. "She's not <i>that</i> smart. Everyone got all excited because she got commended on all her TAKS but a lot of people do. And I've [read] her books, and most of them are just okay, they're nothing special." So, Summer Hamori, brilliant, or just stuck up? I guess that's up to you to decide. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngel-or-Phantom_5fc6.html" title="User:Angel-or-Phantom">Angel-or-Phantom</a> 23:59, 12 February 2007 (UTC)Erik Smith.... Over.</p>

<p>Annie Oakley is famous beyond belief and yet more and more people seem to be forgetting her name. So here is a little background check: Annie Oakley was a girl who was quite gifted with the art of guns. It all started on a cold day when her family was running out of food. She snuck out with her dad's rifle and shot a rabbit clean through the head on her first try. Not long after she was entering competitions and winning a good deal of them. Annie Oakley grew up in an orphanage, but didn't let that keep her from becoming one of the best shots around! Erik Smith... over.</p>

<p>Joseph Smith was a prophet of the Church of jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, also known as the Mormon church. He showed great bravery, even when he was a kid. Not many people know about the sevire injury he recieved in his foot causing him to require having the bone removed. When the doctor asked him if he wanted some liquior to ease the pain during the surgery Joseph replied with "No, I do not want to drink it." He instead requested to have his father sit on his bed with him while the bone was removed and refused to take any drugs what so ever. A mormon from the start you might say (:! When he grew older there was much confusion amongst churches and Joseph was unsure which to join. While reading the bible he came across a passage talking about praying to God when you need help, and so he did. He found a nice peaceful place in a grove of trees where he kneeled and prayed. It is said that on that day and Angel appeared before him and told him not to fear, it also told him that one day he would be instructed to return to this spot where he would find the <i>golden plates</i>, or the original book of Mormon. He was told that if he remained true to God then he would become leader of the only true church and help bring the Lord's word back to the Earth which a few years after he did. Even after he was brutally insulted, publically humiliated, and locked in jail on multiple accounts when he was not guilty of what was charged, he stuck to his word and therefore even after he was unjustly murdered in a prison cell by a mod of anti-mormons the religion lives on even today.

           Dancee Dances
                  A tale told by Magna
</pre>
<p>On the Friday following Valentine’s Day, a dance was held at Dobie junior high school from 6:00 Pm to 9:00 PM. Although most of the time everything was normal (well, as normal as junior high schoolers can be) until Zack Dancee challenged a group of five guys to a dance off… and beat them all! “What I want to know is why they need five people just to accept my challenge!” Dancee remarks to his friends as he is seen leaving the dance. “Because, they know they have no chance of winning otherwise.” One unidentified friend responds. “You mean they’re afraid they’ll lose?” Zack laughs. “Who wouldn’t be?” The unidentified friend retorts as Zack walked away. The fact is as it remains, Dancee is the best dancer around Dobie. His last name says it all.</p>
<pre>
“He comes from a family of double jointed and highly flexible people. It’s in his deoxyribonucleic acid.” A viewer announces at the questioning looks of the people around her. “Anyone who challenges Dancee better know what they’re doing!”
</pre>
<p>So what do you think? Would you dare challenge Zack Dancee to a Dance-off?</p>
