<dd>Hmm... habe gerade in Dinneen nachgeschlagen; er gibt gar kein Plural dafür an. Nominativ war <i>iolradh</i>, Genitiv <i>iolraidh</i>. Von den Formen würde man eigentlich ein Plural <i>iolraidh</i> erwarten, aber ich weiß nicht, ob es diese Form wirklich gibt/gab. Plural von "Plural" ist sowieso selten; nur 5 unterschiedliche Googlehits für die moderne Form <a href="http://www.google.de/search?q=%22na+hiolra%C3%AD%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.de/search?q=%22na+hiolra%C3%AD%22" rel="nofollow">"na hiolraí"</a>--und die wurden nicht unbedingt von Muttersprachlern geschrieben! —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 21:22, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Stimmt, im deutschen und irischen gäbe es ja eigentlich auch selten die notwendigkeit, eine pluralform zu verwenden&#160;:))) Danke fürs nachschlagen!!

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Middle Irish</span></h2>
<p>Hi Angr, I've read that the term "Middle Irish" is considered "Pro Irish bias" amongst some (possibly most though I dont know but Id guess) Scottish Gaelic speakers and was wondering what your take is regarding the linguistic legitamacy of the term to describe the written language of Gaelic in Scotland up until the 18th Century? Also could you reccommend any good sources book-wise to order from the library as to Middle Irish, particularly in the context of Scotland? Thankyou.82.41.4.66 06:26, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't really have an opinion. Ethnologue calls the written language of Ireland and Scotland up until the 18th century <a href="http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ghc" class="external text" title="http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ghc" rel="nofollow">"Hiberno-Scottish Gaelic"</a> but that seems to be a neologism coined to avoid accusations of pro-Irish bias. I don't know of any books off the top of my head, but I can look up some references later. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 08:50, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Thanx for the reply and if you could come up with any more sources Id be grateful:}82.41.4.66 14:58, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The sources I can find generally say that the written Gaelic of Scotland was identical to the written Gaelic of Ireland up to the 17th century; however, that's not the language called "Middle Irish". <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Irish_f019.html" title="Middle Irish">Middle Irish</a> is the name for the stage up to the 12th century; after that, it's called "Early Modern Irish" or "Classical Irish" or the like (I see that our article needs to be updated in that regard). Since that's about the same time period as Scottish Gaelic begins to be attested, I suppose "Early Scottish Gaelic" or "Classical Scottish Gaelic" could be used, although that would cover up the fact that the written language of Scotland and Ireland was basically identical until the 17th/18th century. I suppose Ethnologue's term really is the most neutral, but as I say, I don't think it's particularly common.</dd>
<dd>I'm afraid I'm not finding much in the way of sources for "Hiberno-Scottish Gaelic" in Scotland. If you can read Irish, there's a chapter on Classical Modern Irish in <i>Stair na Gaeilge</i> (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-901519-90-1</a>), but it's more focused on the language in Ireland than in Scotland. I don't know of a history of Scottish Gaelic, though that doesn't mean there isn't one.

<p>Well, itll be some time before I can read and understand much Gaelic of either language (studying them on and off (mostly off) with internet resources and no teacher I mean.}), but if you could tell me the sources stating that both languages were identical as a written language up to the eighteenth century (and which ones are most reliable from a linguit's point of view) that would be just as useful, cheers:}82.41.4.66 17:45, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

The Scottish Gaelic chapter (by William Gillies) says, "in the ...

<dd>Regarding Image:1992 sunburst yellow flickr Vikas GarG.jpg, the Flickr source showed that the photographer released it under <b>CC-BY-ND 2.0</b>. Unfortunately, that isn't one of the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creative_Commons_Licenses_4308.html" title="Creative Commons Licenses">Creative Commons Licenses</a> that is acceptable at Wikipedia.

For Image:2006 copper red flickr Coffee Monster.jpg the problem <i>was</i> that you didn't provide a link directly to the Flickr page.

<p>In the AFD topic you wrote "It's convenient to have a place listing the users whose image uploads need to be monitored especially closely." I'm not referring to you when I say this, but I've had problems with these 'fair use inquisitors' who try rounding up every fair use image I and others have uploaded and delete them on the strictest set of premises and I don't feel comfortable with having users watching my every move.</p>
<p>While you certainly shouldn't look the other way when it comes to fair use, I don't think its fair to single out a group of people and constantly monitor their uploads just because they disagree with certain policies.</p>
<p>For the record, I'm not completely against GFDL; I've uploaded 16 GFDL images lately <b><a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberGhostface_739d.html#GFDL_Image_Gallery" title="User:CyberGhostface">here</a></b>. The purpose of the template is NOT for users against the policy or for deliberately sabatoging the rules, its for people who are frustrated with the low quality of some GFDL images when compared to fair use ones.</p>
<p>I hope I didn't come out as sounding hostile in writing this as from what I can tell you seem to be very polite in contrast to some of the more confrontational users I've had dealings with.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberGhostface_739d.html" title="User:CyberGhostface">CyberGhostface</a> 01:08, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi there. I contacted you once before about image copyright tagging, and I have another question. All photographic images on the page linked to above have been uploaded using the {{<a href="../../../c/c/-/Template%7ECc-by-sa-2.5_49da.html" title="Template:Cc-by-sa-2.5">cc-by-sa-2.5</a>}}, ie Image:Guardian Council 10.jpg, but I think that this may be incorrect and the source posted no longer exists. Iranian law states <i>copyright in photographs and movies lasts 30 years from the date of publication or presentation; and copyright in other images lasts for the life of the creator plus 30 years</i>. There is nothing that states that the tag used is correct, so what to do? Also, the user thinks I am specifically targeting him as I have political motivations, which I don't, so a third party may be helpful to diffuse any sticky situation. I simply look through fair use, and if I see that a user uploads many images under wrong licenses or with "fair use" that is incorrect, I look through that users upload log to look for other possible violations. If you can help, thanks in advance. --<a href="../../../g/r/c/User%7EGrcampbell_a0e7.html" title="User:Grcampbell">Bob</a> 22:20, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If the source is unavailable and the license can't be verified, cross them both out and tag the image {{subst:nsd}} and {{subst:nld}}.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">No consensus?</span></h2>
<p>Angr, given your constant opposition to every aspect of that proposal, I think you're hardly in a position to neutrally declare it a failure. Most posts (save yours) were generally supportive. I was on the verge of calling it a guideline (as you yourself had suggested), but I didn't know if a formal vote was necessary or whether I was the one who should have been making that call since I had proposed it in the first place.</p>
<p>This issue <i>will not go away</i>. We cannot let admins, especially those with an explicitly stated bias against <i>any</i> fair use pics whatsoever, define replaceability. We <i>need</i> it defined, or there is merely tyranny, RFCs and people leaving.</p>
<p>You yourself indicated that you were mostly comfortable with it although you wanted to eliminate the middle category. I made some changes to it that you never commented on, so I assume you were OK with them.</p>
<p>You're out of line here. Way out of line. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 03:40, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You could ask for a second opinion at the admins' noticeboard, but looking over the talk page I didn't see consensus emerging and I didn't see myself as the only person who had serious problems with the stated definition of replaceability. And when it's been almost a month since anyone has said anything at all, I think it's fair to call a proposal dead in the water. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 05:12, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Already did ask for a second opinion, under Kat's statement. Plus a message on Jimbo's page. If that draws no response (frankly, I'd like people to move beyond hashing the whole free-use/fair-use debate and define replaceability so we can all move forward instead), then I'll consider it rejected as it currently stands, and start working on a new version.
<p>What's <i>your</i> definition of replaceability, while we're at it? Give me something I can work with. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 05:19, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For me, a nonfree image is <b>nonreplaceable</b> if it's copyrighted 2- or 3-dimensional art, a still from a TV show or movie, or a photograph showing a unique historical event. A nonfree image is <b>not easily replaceable</b> (but still not completely nonreplaceable!) if it's of a no longer existing structure (bridge, building, etc.), an extinct or endangered animal or plant species, of a deceased person, or a living person who is in prison, under house arrest, or known to be reclusive.</dd>

<dd>I think you should distinguish between two senses of replaceability: first, replaceable in that it is possible to create a free image as the possible subject of the picture exists. and replaceable in that a free image might be found to exist or the existing licensing might be changed but no new image could be created. I would like some recognition of that in any policy. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 18:48, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Underspecification</span></h2>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I recently posted a link to an external source about scope underspecification, to the Underspecification entry. It was removed and I don't understand why: the website I linked to was not a personal site (and was certainly not my own, as was implied in the note on why it was removed), and the underspecification programme available there is not commercial; it was developed within the CHORUS project at Saarland University, it is free, and will be of interest to anyone working on scope underspecification.</p>
<p>I would have expected that this would be exactly the kind of external link the wikipedia entry would benefit from. Please let me know why it was removed, or simply restore the link. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Shievak (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Shievak_b7e3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Shievak">contribs</a>) 00:51, 15 February 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>Wikipedia's guidelines for external links are at <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>. The link seemed inappropriate to me because external links to Wikipedia articles are usually places where the reader can learn more about the topic, rather than places where they can download software that somehow relates to the topic of the article (unless of course the article itself is <i>about</i> that software). And while the site itself may be noncommercial, it seemed to me to contain "objectionable amounts of advertising" (to quote from <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html#Links_normally_to_be_avoided" title="WP:EL">WP:EL#Links normally to be avoided</a>). Finally, considering the link is related to semantic underspecification in natural language processing, I didn't think it was particularly relevant in an article about phonological underspecification in general linguistic theory. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 05:21, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Underspecification Again</span></h2>
<p>Thank you very much for your response. I included the link because the page provides a tool that is a unique resource for anyone working on scope underspecification. The content of the website is directly and symmetrically relevant to the topic of underspecification, and the fact that links are <i>usually</i> not to software doesn't seem like a sufficient reason to not include it.</p>
<p>As for advertising: the only parts of the website that seem even slightly advertise-ish are the title of the software and part of one sentence describing what the new version does. In my opinion, this is clearly not "excessive advertising", and it would be a misreading of the Wikipedia guidelines to claim otherwise. Further, the website doesn't promote, link to, or even mention anything commercial, which many sites linked to by Wikipedia can't claim. But am I missing something? Are you seeing something that I am not?</p>
<p>Finally, there's the matter of the topic: It is true that if the article is really about phonological underspecification then the link is not relevant. But that is not what this article is about: phonological underspecification was given as an <i>example</i>, but as the title suggests, the article is to cover underspecification in general. Thus, ideally, it would include information about a variety of areas. Hopefully a link about semantic underspecification will encourage others to edit the article to include a wider variety of information, and decrease the chance of readers being misled about the scope of the article by the dominance of the phonology example.</p>

<dd>Polish doesn't have five genders! It only has three: masculine, feminine, and neuter.

This gives 5 if you want to insist that a word must not change gender from singular to plural. However, if you also include how the counting words (one and two) are inflected you can at least see 6 categories in the table or perhaps 15!

<dd>It had a source but in an unorthodox format; the source was in one the fair use rational headers (number three I believe). It was used not to illustrate a living person but to show the two of them playing during their careers and illustrate their rivalry. The layout was probably confusing but the picture was poor quality compared to the original and it would be near impossible to find a a fair use pic of the two of them playing each other.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Gaeilge question</span></h2>
<p>Hi Angr&#160;:-) As your Gaeilge is better than mine, I could use some help with a question from another editor:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"do you know correct pronunciations for "Taranis" and "Eochaid Ollathair?" I know "Taranis" should be "Tha-ra-nish," but is the "i" pronounced "eye" or "ee," and on which syllable does the emphasis come? As for "Eochaid Ollathair," (spelling varies, of course), I believe the second part would be something like "oh-la-heer," but the first? I'm at a loss."</dd>
</dl>
<p>I would assume that, as with other words, emphasis of all of these is on the first syllable, and the "i" is "ih" or "ee", depending. But I'm not sure about Eochaid. With my shreds of Gàidhlig I can hazard an Ulster pronunciation, but thought better of possibly giving the wrong answer.

<p>Hi I have replaced the <a href="../../../f/i/l/Category%7EFilms_with_a_pedophile_theme_5ffb.html" title="Category:Films with a pedophile theme">Category:Films with a pedophile theme</a> for <a href="../../../l/2E/i/L.I.E._0330.html" title="L.I.E.">L.I.E.</a> Some people use the term pederasty, some pedophilia for child molestation of pubertal/post-pubertal children, though of course pedophilia itself (being sexually attracted to children) is not a crime. In the UK, the term paedophilia is universally accepted as the word that describes sexual attraction to children, including younger teenagers. Pederasty is seldom used in the UK, though pederast is sometimes used as a term of abuse. On Wikipedia we therefore must accept both terms. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sandel_9801.html" title="User:Tony Sandel">Tony</a> 10:37, 27 February 2007 (UTC)Tony</p>

<dd>Have you even seen the movie? There is no child molestation or indeed <i>any</i> sexual contact between the two main characters; and even if there had been, the teenager in question was 16 (i.e. above the age of consent in the UK and several U.S. states).

<dd>The article has pederast in the first line. That definitey means sexual activity, so I'm not sure you can make your assertions. There doesn't need to be explicit sexual activity on screen in a movie with a pederastic or pedophile theme. Because of the legal position, any such activity is frequently underplayed in movies that have a pedophile theme. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sandel_9801.html" title="User:Tony Sandel">Tony</a> 11:08, 27 February 2007 (UTC)Tony</dd>

<dd>Pederasty and pedophilia are not the same, and don't even have much overlap, so please don't lump them together. The character of Big John can be described as a pederast because he has had sex with boys under 18 (though not with the main character Howie). Pedophilia refers specifically to an attraction to pre-pubescent children, and there is no indication that he's attracted to pre-pubescent boys. The fact that some reviewers misuse the word "pedophile" doesn't surprise me, but it doesn't mean we have to follow suit. The article is already appropriately in <a href="../../../p/e/d/Category%7EPederastic_film_215b.html" title="Category:Pederastic film">Category:Pederastic film</a>, which is a distinct category from <a href="../../../f/i/l/Category%7EFilms_with_a_pedophile_theme_5ffb.html" title="Category:Films with a pedophile theme">Category:Films with a pedophile theme</a> for very good reasons. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 11:17, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've read lots about it. Nothing I've read convinces me that L.I.E. is any way pedophilia-related, except under an alarmist and unscientific definition of "pedophilia" that has no business in an encyclopedia. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 13:09, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've watched the movie again and listened to the director's and star's full length commentaries. I have overhauled the article as you will see. We can put aside our differences over pederasty/pedophilia as there are two clear instances showing that Big John is attracted to pre-pubescent boys. I've also confirmed that the boys were 15 not 16 and so were under age. The movie takes place in late spring and Howie's birthday is in July. Gary's age is never mentioned in the film though the commentaries say he is 15.<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sandel_9801.html" title="User:Tony Sandel">Tony</a> 01:31, 28 February 2007 (UTC)Tony

<h2><span class="mw-headline">To slash or not to slash?</span></h2>
<p>Yo, Angry Dude!! Shhh, don't tell anyone this but I've been rather hard at work (offline) on an extension of <a href="../../../s/e/s/Sesotho_language.html" title="Sesotho language">Sesotho language</a>.</p>
<p>I have a question about IPA pronunciation guides (I'm including them for every example I give and every mention of phonemes and formatives, and there's currently 1011 of them): what's the difference between slashes and square brackets? Everything I've seen suggests that the pronunciation guide for the language name in the language infobox should be enclosed in square brackets, not the slashes that are currently used. Also, if the IPA is isolated, is it acceptable to simply not delimit it?</p>
<p>One more question: what's the proper IPA symbol for the Sesotho superclose vowels i and u (they're higher than the English examples given in the table in the article - see <a href="../../../p/h/u/Phuthi_language.html" title="Phuthi language">Phuthi language</a> for a clue)?

<dl>
<dd>Strictly, the slashes are for <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoneme.html" title="Phoneme">phonemic representation</a> and the brackets for phonetic representation. It's usually best to use phonetic representation for languages other than English because you can't expect the reader to know all the allophones of the various phonemes. For the distinction between "ordinary" close /i u/ and "superclose" /i u/ I'd either use <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[i u]</span> for the ordinary ones and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[i̝ u̝]</span> for the "superclose" ones, or <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[i̞ u̞]</span> for the ordinary ones and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[i u]</span> for the "superclose" ones.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Fair use images</span></h2>
<p>Can I ask for advise. If somebody uploads an image without source of a deceased politician should I remove it from an article since it has no source or should I look for a source and look for a relevant fair use stamp for it? (I don't like fair use much personally.) I ask because of the actions of <span id="Mhstebbi" class="plainlinks">Mhstebbi&#160;(<a href="../../../m/h/s/User_talk%7EMhstebbi_650b.html" title="User talk:Mhstebbi">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mhstebbi_155a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mhstebbi">contribs</a> <small>•</small> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow"><span style="color:#002bb8">logs</span></a></span>). He never replies to anything on his talk page, consistently removed free images and replaces them with unsourced images but when he puts unsourced images on articles about deceased people and we have no free equivalent I am unsure whether I should remove the image.

<dd>When he replaces free images with unfree ones, revert him immediately and tag the images as {{<a href="../../../i/m/a/Template%7EImagevio_54eb.html" title="Template:Imagevio">imagevio</a>}}. When he adds unsourced images of dead people to pages that don't already have an image, you may either (1) look for a source yourself, or (2) tag the image with {{<a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_substitution_a63d.html" title="Wikipedia:Template substitution">subst</a><tt>:</tt><a href="../../../n/s/d/Template%7ENsd_37e6.html" title="Template:Nsd">nsd</a>}}. In the latter case, don't remove the image from the article, as it's possible he or someone else will add a source within the 7-day grace period, and <a href="../../../o/r/p/User%7EOrphanBot_88cf.html" title="User:OrphanBot">OrphanBot</a> will comment out the image from the article after four days anyway. But do keep the image on your watchlist to make sure no one removes the tag without adding an adequate source. Whether your course of action is (1) or (2) is entirely up to you, but if you do (1) then you're also at least partially responsible for writing a <a href="../../../f/u/r/WP%7EFURG_8725.html" title="WP:FURG">fair-use rationale</a>. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 05:12, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
