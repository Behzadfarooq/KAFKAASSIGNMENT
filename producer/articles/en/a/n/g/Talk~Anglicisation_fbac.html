<p>Loss of Anglicized names due to "national pride" or official pressure: Not sure Bombay/Mumbai and Peking/Beijing are good examples of this. "Bombay" to "<a href="../../../m/u/m/Mumbai.html" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>" was a real name change: the two names are etymologically differerent, although they do look like they could be related. As for <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>, there's nothing "official" about Peking becoming Beijing. The only <i>official</i> name for China's capital is 北京, and the Hanyu <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinyin.html" title="Pinyin">Pinyin</a> spelling of these characters happens to be Běijīng. While the PRC government may be promoting Hanyu Pinyin as its preferred Romanization scheme, this seems to be more about consistently representing the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandarin_Chinese_dfc7.html" title="Mandarin Chinese">Mandarin Chinese</a> language in Roman letters than dictating what appears on maps intended for non-Chinese speakers --- as evident from the fact that the pronunciation of some letters in Hanyu Pinyin bears no relation to their pronunciation in <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a> or indeed most languages using the <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_alphabet.html" title="Latin alphabet">Latin alphabet</a> --- e.g. q, x. In any case, Francophones seem quite happy with Pékin. What may have happened is that English-speakers caught wind of the Pinyin spelling and thought that some sort of name-change *had* occurred and for that reason started using "Beijing" (of course missing out the tone diacritics when writing it).</p>
<p>Sometimes a place name appears anglicized, but is not. In some cases, the form being used in English is an older name that has now been changed. For example, <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turin.html" title="Turin">Turin</a> in the <a href="../../../p/i/e/Piedmont.html" title="Piedmont">Piedmont</a> area of <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>, is named <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turin.html" title="Turin">Turin</a> in the original <a href="../../../p/i/e/Piedmontese.html" title="Piedmontese">Piedmontese</a> language, but now officially known as <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torino.html" title="Torino">Torino</a> in Italian. In some cases, <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/02/0206_060206_torino.html?source=rss" class="external text" title="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/02/0206_060206_torino.html?source=rss" rel="nofollow">link English-language media</a> overcompensates for this in the mistaken belief that the name being used in English was imposed by English speakers and is some sort of injustice. Locals tried to get Piedmontese included as an official olympic language, but were unsucessful. Well, I guess someone has to finish what Mussolini started.</p>
<p>Still-Anglicized place names are certainly not all Western European, and includes some where the name might be expected to be the subject of political contention (e.g. <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>)</p>
<p>Better examples of official de-Anglicization might be <a href="../../../i/v/o/Ivory_Coast_4413.html" title="Ivory Coast">Ivory Coast</a>, where the government insists that the name not be translated from the original <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a> (Côte d'Ivoire), or <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calcutta.html" title="Calcutta">Calcutta</a> becoming Kolkata. --- <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlagboy_79ae.html" title="User:Flagboy">Alex</a> -- 2005-07-29 17:45 UCT</p>
<p>Names were not changed by immigration officials in the United States. This is an urban myth that has been propagated for many many years. Immigration officials didn't write down names, but rather worked from manifests provided by the shipping companies. Any errors were made by the company, and not the Immigration clerks. Immigration officials were available who spoke the native languages of the immigrants. This is not to say that name changes did not occur. They did. It happened in my extended family when a grade school teacher told an great uncle of mine that he was spelling his last name wrong. My paternal grandfather changed the family's name for unknown reasons; but to say that name changes occured by government officials is simply untrue.<a href="http://uscis.gov/graphics/aboutus/history/articles/NAMES.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://uscis.gov/graphics/aboutus/history/articles/NAMES.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><a href="http://www.genealogy.com/88_donna.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.genealogy.com/88_donna.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a><a href="http://www.ancestry.com/learn/library/article.aspx?article=3893" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ancestry.com/learn/library/article.aspx?article=3893" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>
<p>It is also a bit of an overstatement to say "personal names have been heavily anglicised." The examples given of Johann/John, Piotr/Peter, Giorgos/George, and Yeshua/Joshua have been anglicised. These are all <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Biblical_names_47b4.html" title="List of Biblical names">biblical names</a>, and have analogs in all European languages via <a href="../../../k/o/i/Koine_Greek_17ca.html" title="Koine Greek">Hellenistic Greek</a> translation/transliteration of Hebrew names. It is possible to find analogs of these names in other Middle Eastern languages as well. There's examples of this, <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_I_of_Russia_4d2f.html" title="Peter I of Russia">Peter the Great</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Columbus_1595.html" title="Christopher Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a>, and the Pope's ruling name for three. However it seems like this phenomena primarily occurs with individuals of historical prominence, not average persons, and not recently practiced (with the notable exception of the Pope). If someone can cite some stats or examples of widespread anglicisiation of personal names, I think this section should be rewritten. I guess its ultimately a judgement call, but I lean against the characterization of "heavy." -- 70.106.209.48 05:37, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Isn't it good to rename this article <i>Anglici<b>z</b>ation</i>? I think Wikipedia has many more <i>-ization</i> entries than <i>-isation</i> entries. - <a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETAKASUGI_Shinji_1b69.html" title="User:TAKASUGI Shinji">TAKASUGI Shinji</a> 09:35, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>To quote "Anglicisation is a process of making something English". We spell things -isation in England, American's would spell it -ization. Hence, Americani<i>zation</i> is correct, Anglici<i>zation</i> is incorrect. <a href="../../../s/e/l/User%7ESelphie_7688.html" title="User:Selphie">Selphie</a> 09:46, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC) <a href="../../../s/e/l/User_talk%7ESelphie_978f.html" title="User talk:Selphie">*talk*</a></p>
<p>It doesn't make much sense, because Americans speak English, not American. This article is mainly about changing non-English words to English or English-like ones, and it happens both in England and America. This is clearly different from <a href="../../../a/m/e/Americanization.html" title="Americanization">Americanization</a>, adoption of American culture. Anyway, I'm not enthusiastic on Americanizing the spelling, and it's okay if majority prefer <i>Anglici<b>s</b>ation</i> to <i>Anglici<b>z</b>ation</i>.</p>
<p>I think it's better, like I said - it's talking about British English not American English and therefore the British English would be the correct spelling. <a href="../../../s/e/l/User%7ESelphie_7688.html" title="User:Selphie">Selphie</a> 12:12, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC) <a href="../../../s/e/l/User_talk%7ESelphie_978f.html" title="User talk:Selphie">*talk*</a></p>

<dd>Whatever the OED may or may not say I, as a true Brit (being of both English and Welsh extraction), would always consider the use of <i>-ization</i> as American (I mean -isation just comes off the pen/keybourd more naturally to a Brit, I'm sure the converse is true for an American, one doesn't even think about it). About not using <i>regional variants</i>, who's to say that your spelling is not a <i>regional variant</i>? Be that as it may, I do not see either usage as wrong <i>per se</i>, but should be at the discretion of the founder of the article. If the article is started as <i>Anglicisation</i>, then why change it? As long as it's made clear that alternative spellings exist, and as long as people are re-directed here when they use the alternative for a search, then why the grief? Your demands smack of <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_imperialism.html" title="Cultural imperialism">cultural imperialism</a> and personal opinion (even POV) to me.</dd>

<p>Eh? Did you not read what I wrote? Are you bound only to repeat yourself? I can also repeat <i><a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_nauseum.html" title="Ad nauseum">ad nauseum</a></i> if you like (but I think this'll be my last), <i>Whatever the OED may or may not say I, as a true Brit (being of both English and Welsh extraction), would always consider the use of</i> -ization <i>as American (I mean -isation just comes off the pen/keyboard more naturally to a Brit, I'm sure the converse is true for an American, one doesn't even think about it</i>. I don't dispute your practical knowledge of being American, so why should you dispute my practical knowledge of being British? I merely point out that as a Brit <i>anglicization</i> does not come as a <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural.html" title="Natural">natural</a> or <a href="../../../n/o/r/Normal.html" title="Normal">normal</a> spelling, whatever the OED may or may not say. I'm absolutely sure the OED gives definitive spellings for other words that you would heatedly dispute yourself!!!!! What <i>I</i> mean by a regional variant is that, what is a variant is dependent on what region a person lives in at any given time. Take the term <i>bloke</i> for example. You may consider it a British or Australian regional variant of <i>guy</i>. Whereas a Brit or Aussie would consider <i>guy</i> a regional variant of <i>bloke</i>. Everything is relative. I might add that there is no <i>standard English</i>. I live in <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finland.html" title="Finland">Finland</a> and the state actually controls the language, (i.e. decides what is standard <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finnish.html" title="Finnish">Finnish</a> or not, I believe the same is true in <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/r/German.html" title="German">German</a>), the same is not true of <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a>, <a href="../../../i/p/s/Ipso_facto.html" title="Ipso facto">ipso facto</a> anything goes in English, there is no such thing as correct English. Or if you like, there's no such thing as a regional variant, or perhaps all non standard <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parochialism.html" title="Parochialism">parochial</a> words are regional variants. Both definitions work for me. Chill out. If the meaning is generally accepted and <i>anglicized</i> is redirected to here, with the proviso that other spellings exist, then why the grief? I suspect <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_imperialism.html" title="Cultural imperialism">cultural imperialism</a>. I've been to your user page and have the impression that you consider anything other than <i>americanisations</i> <i>(<a href="../../../s/i/c/Sic.html" title="Sic">sic</a>)</i> <a href="../../../b/e/y/Beyond_the_pale.html" title="Beyond the pale">beyond the pale</a>, or why else all the references to <i>encyclopaedia</i>?--<a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 20:28, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

I'm just trying to say that Anglicization/Anglicisation isn't something limited to the UK, even if the language was invented there. As for having a governing body, English really could use one. As for the name of this article, I give up. And no, I don't hate British spellings/words, especially since I feel that the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28soccer%29.html" title="Football (soccer)">football (soccer)</a> article would be better at <a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_football.html" title="Association football">association football</a>, but that's just me. --<a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvice_796f.html" title="User:Evice"><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɛvɪs/</span></a> <a href="../../../e/v/i/User_talk%7EEvice_f753.html" title="User talk:Evice"><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/tɑːk/</span></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Evice_7d9a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Evice"><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/kɑntɹɪbjuʃənz/</span></a> 17:15, Jun 24, 2005 (UTC)

Just because most English dialects have more speakers that use -ise over -ize doesn't mean that the -ize variants can't be accepted. Similarily, I'm pretty sure that more Americans, including myself, use <i>gray</i> over <i>grey</i>, though <i>grey</i> is still acceptable.

Why bother to change any spelling if the spelling is an accepted English spelling, from whatever English variant. Personally I don't find your arguements compelling enough to warrant any sort of change. I tend to agree that an overseeing body for the English language would be a good idea, the problem really is that it would have to be an international body, and we would end up with all variants being accepted anyway.<a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 05:26, 1 September 2005 (UTC)

<p>Why are we accepting that <i>anglicisation is most commonly discussed in the more abstract context of language</i>? I'm not sure this is true, and is it not somewhat POV? I mean does it not depend on who's doing the discussing? I recently linked my <i>user page</i> here, because I mention that <a href="../../../g/w/e/Gwent.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> is <i>one of the most anglicised parts of Wales</i>, only to find that this article is all about language. I think that this article is unbalanced and doesn't reflect the true meaning or usage of the word.--<a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 05:45, 15 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Outside of the United Kingdom, I think it's much more commonly used in a linguistic sense. If there is something interesting to say about the other sense though, feel free to add a section or split this article. I don't know much about <i>anglicisation</i> as it applies to making things more English in a cultural sense, beyond the simple definition that I already included in the first paragraph of the article. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 23:23, May 21, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/g/Talk%7EAnglicisation_fbac.html" title="Edit section: Pronunciation?">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Pronunciation?</span></h2>
<p>Would the pronunciation of words in an Anglicized way count as Anglicization? For example, many U.S. cities have names originating in other languages, whose pronunciations have been mangled (to use a POV term) to conform to English conventions. Some of the most infamous examples are French names in the Midwest and Spanish names in Texas:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../v/i/n/Vincennes%2C_Indiana_d046.html" title="Vincennes, Indiana">Vincennes, Indiana</a> -- <i>vin-SENNZ</i></li>

<li><a href="../../../b/o/u/Bourbonnais%2C_Illinois_48b1.html" title="Bourbonnais, Illinois">Bourbonnais, Illinois</a> -- formerly <i>burr-BO-nus</i> before being "corrected" back to <i>burr-buh-NAY</i></li>
<li><a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Jacinto_County%2C_Texas_585d.html" title="San Jacinto County, Texas">San Jacinto County, Texas</a> -- <i>san juh-SIN-toh</i></li>

</ul>
<p>I wanted to get some opinions about whether this counts as Anglicization, before adding anything to the article. Onyourside 15:13, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would so say so. <a href="../../../a/n/_/User%7EAn_Siarach_8bef.html" title="User:An Siarach">An Siarach</a></dd>

<p>I could be wrong but the US pronuciation of Moscow as /Mɶsgau/ stems from the German name for Moscow "Moscau"? <a href="../../../a/n/_/User%7EAn_Muimhneach_Machnamhach_62bf.html" title="User:An Muimhneach Machnamhach">An Muimhneach Machnamhach</a> 11:25, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article is a ramble it needs to cite its sources (<a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>). There are lots of generalisations that have been added which are clearly a POV. Often this is to do with degree of the type covered by some/many/most which allows for lots of non-NPOV. Eg <i>often even with diacritical marks that do not normally exist in English</i> and others like this <i>With languages that use non-Latin alphabets, such as the Arabic, Cyrillic, and Greek alphabets, a direct transliteration is typically used, in order to secure faithfulness to the original pronunciation rather than conformance to the norms of English</i>. Who says so? If the word is directly translated from the native language into English then unless the grammar rules are the same as English the word will not be read that way. Besides it is not translation from one alphabet to another it is transliteration. Even if the word is from the Latin alphabet one needs to know for example that in German "W" is pronounced as a "V" if one is to have hope of "secur[ing] faithfulness to the original pronunciation" and unless one has learnt German this is unlikely to be true. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 12:09, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's not true at all. "Anglicize" means simply to make more like English. It's true that a common use is to describe anglicization of individual words when importing them into English, but it's also common to describe anglicizing other languages or even entire cultures; one of the two canonical quotes the OED has under its 'anglicize' entry refers to the British 'anglicization of India'.
