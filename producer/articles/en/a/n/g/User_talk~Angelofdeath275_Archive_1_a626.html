<p>Some other person tagged a pic from Angel Blade and labeled it pd-self. I made the screenshots myself. So, which tag am I supposed to use? Let alone you already changed the tags. "THROUGH FIRE, JUSTICE IS SERVED!" 03:58, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The correct tag is the one I used, {{<a href="../../../v/i/d/Template%7EVideo-screenshot_b51b.html" title="Template:Video-screenshot">video-screenshot</a>}}, or a similar one. There is a complete list at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags</a>, which is quite easy to use (in this case, for instance, I just searched for "screenshot", found the "Film and television stills/screenshots" section, and picked the most appropriate tag from it). {{<a href="../../../p/d/-/Template%7EPd-self_7b74.html" title="Template:Pd-self">pd-self</a>}} is used only when you are the creator of the complete work; just taking a screenshot of it is not enough. Unfortunately, copyright law is quite complex; the tags just reflect that complexity. --<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesarB_5f7f.html" title="User:CesarB">cesarb</a> 04:45, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have images of <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloodrayne.html" title="Bloodrayne">Bloodrayne</a>, but I am unsure which copyright tag to use because:</p>
<p>Bloodrayne: the images I have, you see them in the guide in the charcter section</p>
<p>Bloodrayne: you see these after you beat the game. A section called the gallery shows images of the game. like the hi-res images, and the "building blocks" (parts of an image in the game, etc.) what copright tag should i use? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngelofdeath275_0dd1.html" title="User:Angelofdeath275">Angelofdeath275</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngelofdeath275_c4bc.html" title="User talk:Angelofdeath275">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angelofdeath275_5751.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angelofdeath275">contribs</a>) 05:24, 17 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>edit: sorry the 2nd one was ment to be Bloodrayne 2...I believe the "2" doesnt work correctly.....but I'm still unsure about the one from Bloodrayne, because you never see this specific pic, it kinda looks like the characters were posed like this for the pics.

<dd>Well, if it's not from a in-game screenshot, it should be a different tag... If you cannot find the correct one at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair use</a>, you probably will have to use the "generic" one, which is {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFair_use_in_d68b.html" title="Template:Fair use in">fair use in</a>|article}}. --<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesarB_5f7f.html" title="User:CesarB">cesarb</a> 19:06, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I reverted your edits for several reasons, and I did <i>not</i> call them <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAND_6593.html" title="WP:VAND">vandalism</a>.</p>
<p>First, according to the guidelines of the <a href="../../../m/a/n/WP%7EMANGA_5d75.html" title="WP:MANGA">WP:MANGA</a> Wikiproject, which governs articles on anime and manga, trivia sections are to be minimized and avoided whenever possible. Second, they were incoherently written and would confuse anybody who was not already well acquainted with the subject matter.</p>
<p>Further, your edits read like personal commentary, which is unencyclopedic and against both the most foundational of all Wikipedia principles, the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Neutral Point of View</a>, and the policy against <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. Finally, they were speculative, which violates another of Wikipedia's key policies, the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability principle</a>. If you by some chance have not done so, then please read these pages.</p>
<p>As for my own talk page, it is currently filled with rants by a banned user who kept calling the Chinese Wikipedia administrators "COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT SPIES!!!" and the like. He is a blatant vandal, and his comments should not be considered an accurate reflection on my behaviour. The edits of his I was reverting were <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a>, which can be removed by anyone according to policy. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> <small><a href="../../../t/j/s/User_talk%7ETjstrf_3ddb.html" title="User talk:Tjstrf">talk</a></small> 09:46, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Go read the Tokyo Mew Mew mangas, and see the untranslated words for yourself. That would make question how tokyopop could have missed these words. I assuming you nerver read Tokyo Mew Mew which would make you think, not know that it isnt orginal research, so wouldnt know the untranslated words. Keep in mind that the target audience for tokyopop is around 10 yrs old, so i try to provide as much as possible. It is NO WHERE near orginal reseach if i have the mangas and always read them when im about to add something.. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngelofdeath275_0dd1.html" title="User:Angelofdeath275">"THROUGH FIRE, JUSTICE IS SERVED!"</a> 23:28, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, generally people look in an encyclopedia to learn about things they don't already know. People write articles about things they know, but they read ones about things that they don't. Our target audience is readers, not editors.</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, Tokyopop's motives are not for us to speculate at. They may do a poor localization job, but that is their prerogative as licensor.

<p>Yep, it was me again who changed the kanji in Blue Knight's name... Please, don't revert this anymore. I explained everything on the discussion pages for the articles. I was kinda surprised too, when I first watched episode 17 and noticed that the kanji "ao" wasn't the kanji I expected it to be. I went to some online Japanese-English dictionary, and there it was said that the kanji also reads "ao" and means "blue". But it's not the same kanji as in Aoyama's name. I think the purpose of using different kanji was to make the fact that the Blue Knight is Aoyama not so obvious. (Remember, in the manga, the names are WRITTEN in all their glory, and it would be kinda hard not to notice the similarity between the two names.) Using the same kanji in both names seems to be a common mistake, actually, as I've seen it numerous times on different TMM sites. So, I don't think that my edits can be considered vandalism, as I actually tried to correct the wrong information. Also, you may want to know my opinion on the "Chimera Anima(l)" thing. It is written on Tokyo Mew Mew discussion page. I'm anxious to see your comments. <a href="../../../y/u/m/User%7EYume_no_Kishi_995f.html" title="User:Yume no Kishi">Yume no Kishi</a> 20:44, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you... I went to your User Page, and there was a big surprise for me. Thank you very much. ^_^ You made me happy!</p>
<p>So, I wrote more stuff about Zakuro's weapon and attack name, and all this "cross" stuff. It still SHOULD be mentioned somewhere, I believe... Maybe write a note about it, without changind the attack's incantaton (like you did it with Chimera Anima(l))? Also, I tried to explain what does it look like when Japanese words are written in katakana, and how using the same letters when translating them into other language makes it look even more confusing. I think you'll like this explanation.</p>
<p>And there is one more thing that needs clarification. The connection between Masaya and Deep Blue. I kinda begin to understand what was really going on... but now all I have is Pie's explanation from episode 50. I think I'll need some info from the manga. It IS said in the anime who Deep Blue really is, but there are so many rumors about him that this topic is really confusing now. And the info in the articles is... well... not always correct.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">My opinion on all this hell that was here some time ago, and that'll probably return.</span></h2>
<p>Sorry that I write all this on your talk page, but I just can't remain silent.</p>
<p>Why almost <i>nobody</i> seems to see the difference between things? What we write about "reborn" are <b>facts</b>. You know, it's been confirmed by two mangas completely unrelated to "Tokyo Mew Mew", by your teacher... geez, every person who is Japanese or knows the Japanese language very well can confirm it! And I say <i>again</i> that it's just <i>stupid</i> to translate <b>the same word</b> two different ways in different mangas. And we've already explained why "reborn" does make sense.</p>
<p>What these people trying to write is their <b>point of view</b>, the thing that is not appreciated here in Wikipedia. <i>Of course, nobody will use the correct translation, if nobody points out which word is correct!</i> I wonder if it really hurts these people to admit that they're mistaken. "Used for years"... do they know how many translation errors were there in the "Sailor Moon" manga? They also had been used for years, just because people didn't know that they were errors! But then some people explained them, and now the mistakes are corrected almost everywhere.</p>
<p>Ian Miller, the owner of <a href="http://antares7.absoludicrous.net/" class="external text" title="http://antares7.absoludicrous.net/" rel="nofollow">DIES GAUDII</a> website, apparently was (and probably still is) absolutely hated by many Wikipedians. Why? - Because he stated the truth, just like we do now. Yes, the person who knows Japanese, who writes absolutely <i>wonderful</i> articles about "Sailor Moon", who always tries to cite as many sources as possible and to provide the most complete and understandable explanations on all confusing things, - he was hated by Wikipedia users who didn't want to accept the correct translation of the words.</p>
<p>I don't know how to protect our info in the articles. I really wish some of Wikipedia sysops knew Japanese - then we could probably explain the thing, and maybe they would be able to stop these people from deleting this stuff. Either we should wait for several years before more people prove our translation (seeing how long the "Sailor Moon" mistakes lived), or we should create our own website where we can write anything we want. Yes, I'll be able to restore the deleted info, if only nothing happens to my computer. But the constant arguing with the people who delete it cause me terrible headache. I don't understand what's wrong with saying that something was mistranslated. I'll repeat myself: I don't understand why delete this thing. Are we forcing people to use the correct translation? - No. Even if we leave the word "ribbon" in the articles themselves, it's still a mistranslation, so <i>what's wrong with stating it</i>?! Those who have their own sites are still able to write there <i>anything they want</i> - so why delete it from Wikipedia and say that we are stupid or something else? And I used to like Neko-Tokyo website...</p>

<p>I acknowledge that the character above is a fictional character. However, if you look at the banner you removed, you will also see a picture of a mermaid on it, because such creatures are among the primary focuses of the project. You will also note that the character in question is categorized as a mermaid. Because the project whose banner you have removed is probably going to be one which knows better than most others the facts on any content related to the character's status as a mermaid, and might be best able to ensure relevant links to similar pages on such creatures and, possibly, even improve the content related to such entities (for instance, in perhaps pointing out how the character is similar to or different from other versions of mercreatures, and even to the finless porpoise which she is genetically related to), which might help bring the article up to GA or better status eventually, it was thought relevant to include the article within the scope of a project which more directly deals with such matters. However, if you believe that you and your project are the only ones which could ever even remotely be able or interested in improving the article beyond it's current Start-class status, than the other project for whom I placed the banner you removed would certainly have no objections to not having to work with people who have already judged them to be worthless. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 15:42, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ouch.&#160;:/ Sorry about the tone of the above. Your response seemed a bit chastened, and I realized I may have overstepped propriety. Unfortunately, there is one project which deals with fictional characters which will not go named who seems to think that nobody else has any valid interest in any of their articles, partially because of what seems to be their own minimal understanding of categorization. I have been trying to assess their articles (none of which they have themselves assessed yet as far as I can tell) several times, for several projects, based on the categorization which they later change so as to retain "full control", as it were. I had just dealt with them a short time before you, and was regretably in, shall we say, less than a good mood at the time. Sorry for coming on as hard as I did above. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 21:55, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">My Crazy Idea</span></h2>
<p>Yeah, I was talking to Nihonjoe on his talk page, and he agrees with our translation, but unless we can provide a source we can't post this stuff (though I asked him to remove any stupid comments from those who don't believe).</p>
<p>I can see one way to solve the problem, but it's crazy.</p>
<p>We should contact Ian Miller, the owner of DIES GAUDII website, and ask him to write a comment about this stuff somewhere on his site. I know that he hates Wikipedia, for some users write stupid stuff about him, but I just can't leave this mistranslation here! Please, let's try! He wrote an explanation of Saturn's attack, I think he can mention the Tokyo Mew Mew stuff! I won't leave this mistake here! Never!</p>
<p><a href="../../../y/u/m/User%7EYume_no_Kishi_995f.html" title="User:Yume no Kishi">Yume no Kishi</a></p>
<p>And, by the way, it would be another proof for Saturn's attack, too. These pictures from the anime and the manga show the difference between the two words - a VERY good example!</p>
<p>...I swear, if only he agrees, I'll send him Hotaru Tomoe/Sailor Saturn wallpaper that I made... (He actually likes Hotaru.)</p>

<p>Speaking of "reliable sources".</p>
<p>Tokyopop's manga translation is most certainly <b>not</b> a <i>reliable</i> source, for Tokyopop is known for making stupid mistakes, and it's been proven many times, and not only by "Tokyo Mew Mew".</p>
<p>Fansubs also can hardly be count as a <i>reliable</i> source, for they also contain obvious translation errors (neither Honobono nor AnimeOne bothered to keep the puns in the Mews' attacks).</p>
<p>What does it mean? It means that <i>neither</i> "ribbon" <i>nor</i> "reborn" translation can be proven. That's it.</p>
<p>Funny, yes?</p>

<p>I'm tired of these edit wars. Let's just leave it alone until we find a reliable source; then nobody will be able to object. Let's calm down and continue improving other things. Nihonjoe will take care of people who add stupid stuff. At least he is on our side, and we know this. Let's focus on finding proof for our translation rather then reverting edits.</p>
<p><a href="../../../y/u/m/User%7EYume_no_Kishi_995f.html" title="User:Yume no Kishi">Yume no Kishi</a></p>
<p>Don't worry. I have a copy, you should have one, too. Now, go tell Nihonjoe that we won't fight anymore until we find some proof for this thing.</p>

<p><a href="../../../y/u/m/User%7EYume_no_Kishi_995f.html" title="User:Yume no Kishi">Yume no Kishi</a></p>
<p>Also, try finding good forums for Sailor Moon (yes, Sailor Moon, not TMM) or anime in general (and I mean GOOD forums, not fansites' stuff - this may be Genvid or something like that), and if there is a topic about other anime, try ask a question about this mistranslation here. (Just don't tell that we need info for Wikipedia; you'd better say something like "you know, I've heard this word in TMM was mistranslated everywhere, is it so?", and insert some kana.) That way we'll probably find a person who can prove it.</p>
<p><a href="../../../y/u/m/User%7EYume_no_Kishi_995f.html" title="User:Yume no Kishi">Yume no Kishi</a></p>
<p>I've come up with one idea regarding the Translation Errors section.</p>
<p>Keeping the info on discussion pages without placing it in the articles is very inconvinient. The discussion page for the main Tokyo Mew Mew article is extremely long, has already been archived twice, and it's very hard to keep the info on it in order. (That's why we want to place it in the article).</p>
<p>Finding sources will take some time. Some of the statements simply need to be reworded so that they'll be more understandable. And we still need to keep this section so that we'll be able to improve it.</p>
<p>There is one place besides the articles and their discussion pages, where the info can be put. Our user pages. Yes, I know that they're not the place for such things, but I still want to finish this project.</p>
<p>If I create a subpage from my user page and place the info there, we'll be able to continue improving it without keeping it in the article (user pages do not count as articles, do they?). Eventually we'll be able to return some parts of this section to the Tokyo Mew Mew article.</p>
<p>I <i>believe</i> that this mistakes stuff is rather important, as many fans are confused by mistranslations. However, this section really needs improvement. If we keep it <i>somewhere</i> in Wikipedia, we'll finish this project one day, and this info actually will make a really good article.</p>
<p>What do you think of this idea? Shall I go talk to Nihonjoe and ask him if it's ok to do so... or maybe we'll simply do it without asking permission?</p>
<p><a href="../../../y/u/m/User%7EYume_no_Kishi_995f.html" title="User:Yume no Kishi">Yume no Kishi</a></p>
<p>Well, I've done it anyway, and this way I was able to make a good backup copy of the section, saving to my computer both the page itself and the code. If we eventually get a permission to keep this stuff, I'll be able to recreate it.</p>
<p><a href="../../../y/u/m/User%7EYume_no_Kishi_995f.html" title="User:Yume no Kishi">Yume no Kishi</a></p>
<p>Yep, there is a link to my TE article project from my user page, and it's perfectly ok for you to edit it. If you don't want to edit it yourself, place the info about what needs to be changed/improved on the discussion page for this stuff, and I'll add it. <i>I really want to finish this project.</i> While we're waiting for the reliable info about "reborn", we can continue improving other things in the article. Pictures from the original anime and manga are good things to add into it.</p>
<p>...The reply from Ian Miller... Too bad you wasn't able to see how I was jumping around my computer, <i>screaming</i> with joy (my mom asked me several times what had happened, but I just couldn't explain it to her...).</p>
<p>Yeah, in his case, there also were some Wikipedia users who wrote stupid stuff about his ideas (like Fushi2 about ours... why, <i>why</i> I bothered to ask this person to create a Wikipedia account, <b>why?!</b>), but he at least has his own site where he can place the info. And we have to keep Wikipedia articles from vandals...</p>
<p><a href="../../../y/u/m/User%7EYume_no_Kishi_995f.html" title="User:Yume no Kishi">Yume no Kishi</a></p>
<p><b><a href="../../../y/u/m/User%7EYume_no_Kishi_TMM-related_92ed.html" title="User:Yume no Kishi/TMM-related">Here</a></b> we can place all interesting info related to translation errors and mistakes, so that we'll be able to add it to the articles little by little. I believe there is much more other stuff to add to this page. The TE section in the TMM article got really huge, so I think it needs to be shortened a bit.</p>
<p>Also, I believe there still will be some people who will say that the "Sailor Moon" manga is completely unrelated to "Tokyo Mew Mew", so this isn't neccessarily the same word (yeah, looking at all their lame arguments against "reborn", I think it's quite possible). So, it will be a really good thing if Ian Miller specifically mentions the Tokyo Mew Mew mistake in his article.</p>

<dd>BTW, if you read that article on DIES GAUDII, there are some <i>Japanese</i> sources that show the katakana for "ribbon" instead of "reborn" in Saturn's attack, but seeing how the only difference between the two words is a ー <i>chōon</i>, I think those are just typos.

Neither Wikipedia nor project WikiMoon state explicitly if she is related to Sailor Moon or not, and that's not a bad thing, actually. However, seeing how there is almost no deletion of POV statements in the article's history, I believe people who edit Sailor Moon articles are actually more mature than those who edit TMM articles here, and they just wouldn't add random info in the article. Now, here we have already seen edits done by people who change the info just because they've seen one or two sites where some incorrect statements are written, or they just trust Tokyopop's translations. Because of this, I believe that there will be some people who will insert into Deep Blue's article random theories about his origin, making the info very confusing. But I don't know if it's ok to provide an explanation, as it for sure will be marked as OR. Probably the best we can do is remove some lines from Pie's speech and place it in the articles. Citations don't count as OR, do they?</dd>

<dd>OBrasilo stated that "Paddy" is a misspelling, and I think it's true. The name "Puddy" seems to be derived from the word "Pudding", and also notice how it ends with "-y" - it's rather unusual for the Italian language, as they mostly use the letter "i" for this sound. So, "Puddy" is simply pronounced according to the English phonetics.</dd>

<dd>Tart's nickname... guess it's ok to leave it as "Tar-Tar" (it's been changed again) - I think this is how it would sound if it was derived from the normal English word "Tart" instead of it's Japanese equivalent "Taruto". Since he's called "Tart" in the article, better leave it as "Tar-Tar". And the "u" sound is usually almost silent, so it's not a big deal.</dd>

<p>I don't really understand what was going on in the anime before Deep Blue's awakening. It's just... screwy. Yes, at one point they tried to kill the Blue Knight... I need to at least reread some summaries (tired of watching the anime).</p>

<p>Yep, it was Episode 47, and seeing how even Pie was trying to kill the BK, I suppose they were ordered to do this. Now I don't understand anything at all...</p>

<p>Guess we'll never be able to finish DB's explanation... there are SO many people who try to delete "reborn", that we just don't have enough time for this thing...</p>
<p><a href="../../../y/u/m/User%7EYume_no_Kishi_995f.html" title="User:Yume no Kishi">Yume no Kishi</a></p>
<p>I think we need to hire some person who'll watch the "reborn" thing and keep it from vandals... then maybe we'll be able to work on improving articles...</p>

<p>Though it's amazing that some people even bother to create an account before deleting the "reborn" thing... too bad they either don't read the explanation at all or don't want to accept the correct translation...</p>

<dd>Maybe they thought that having an account would somehow protect them from being called "vandals" and such?.. dunno... I did create an account to fix the "ao" kanji, but I: 1) was 100% sure that I'm right; 2) was ready to show some proof (either a scan from the manga or a screenshot). And these people usually don't even write edit summaries...</dd>

<p><i>About that page I created for our TE stuff.</i></p>
<p>Even though I made it mostly for convenience, just to keep the info in some place where it can easily be found and can't be deleted for the OR, I think it would be good to continue working on it, too. Who knows? maybe it'll eventually make a good article... Too bad we can't use pictures there... but we can insert links to them instead, it's even better, because the page won't be too large. BTW, "Chimera Anima" needs a picture, too, to show that the word is really different from "animal", and a picture with "animal" in katakana I can find somewhere.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Also, I inserted a <b>huge</b> explanation of all Mew Mews' weapons and attacks there, and I would really like if you go to this page and point out which versions were used by Tokyopop, because the whole thing is messed up a bit.</dd>

<p>Seriously, the TE section in the TMM article needs to be shortened. It just... attracts too many people who don't like the very idea of keeping this stuff in the article... <a href="../../../y/u/m/User%7EYume_no_Kishi_995f.html" title="User:Yume no Kishi">Yume no Kishi</a></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Uniforms</span></h2>
<p>I come from Australia where it is compulsory for all schools (private or public) to have uniforms, if I had a choice of going to two similar schools (with similar academic standards) I would choose the one with the cuter uniform. In Japan, it is also compulsory for all schools to have uniforms, and schools in Japan are known for their cute uniforms. You're comparing Berry's decision from an American point of view where most schools don't have uniforms, and I think it is irrelevant when we are talking about a character who is Japanese and lives in Japan, where attitudes towards school and uniforms are different from the US. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECandy-Panda_1c75.html" title="User:Candy-Panda">Candy-Panda</a> 06:06, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well when you're forced to go to a school with an ugly uniform for 13 years, you don't feel unsympathetic towards a character who chooses to go to a school with a pretty one. Fanforums are biased, Wikipedia is supposed to be 100% neutral and what some fans say about some characters are irrelevant to an encyclopedia article. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECandy-Panda_1c75.html" title="User:Candy-Panda">Candy-Panda</a> 06:30, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"..Where did this come from? How does this relate to a manga originally intended for kids?...."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm just saying people who live in countries like Japan where school uniforms are compulsory can relate to wanting to go a school with a pretty uniform. In Australia you wear uniforms in elementary and secondary school so in total it can be 13 years of wearing ugly uniforms. I envy the purple school uniforms of <a href="../../../w/e/s/Wesley_College%2C_Melbourne_d7f7.html" title="Wesley College, Melbourne">Wesley College, Melbourne</a>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Yes they are, but I dont see you commenting on the rest of her "criticism" section. Whenever there is ovbious criticsm/reception on an article, a fans reception comes into play. It is rather hard to be neutral on fan's opinion. Plus, anime news network is a reliable source, so once again, I can't change that reaction to her choosing a school just because of the uniforms."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You're using it as a critisism of a character, when in reality girls wanting to go to schools with pretty uniforms is actually very common in countries where uniforms are compulsory, such as Japan, Australia and other places. It was probably the author's intention to make Berry a ditzy character, many magical girl heroines are. Berry is only 12 after all, it is fitting with the age of her character that she might be tempted by a pretty uniform, and forget about academic expectations. You can use Anime News Network articles as a source of information but NOT Anime News Network's forum posts. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECandy-Panda_1c75.html" title="User:Candy-Panda">Candy-Panda</a> 07:05, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>What would her dad think? There is no mention of what her dad thought. I believe your going too much into this....The whole thing is only on like 3 pages and not even fully explained so I believe you assuming many things..</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe you're the one going too much into this and assuming many things. You're mentioning the dad, who cares what the dad thought? He wasn't mentioned in the first 3 pages, his opinion about her choice of school doesn't need to speculated on in the "critisism" section. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECandy-Panda_1c75.html" title="User:Candy-Panda">Candy-Panda</a> 07:15, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>^^ quote: "I envy the purple school uniforms of Wesley College, Melbourne..." Your relating this too much of your personal experience about school uniforms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I'm sure many other girls would also be able to relate their "personal experiences with uniforms" to Berry wanting to go to a school with a pretty one. It's a normal thing in Japan, and you're using it against Berry.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, gee, um oh I dont know, maybe because when ever a kid is considering transferring to a school, a parent will almost always voice an opinion...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm sure her dad would have had an opinion on her transferring to a new school, it just wasn't shown in the manga because it was irrelevant to plot and people wouldn't find it very interesting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>..which goes back to is not even fully explained...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His opinion wasn't mentioned in the manga, it doesn't need to be mentioned here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apparently I need to explain to you why I wrote that section....I'm removing that banner you put because this discussion is rather flawed, so anything discussed here is not NPOV</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know exactly why you wrote that section, you're using "the fans" opinions to disguise your own, which is why that section is so heavily biased. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECandy-Panda_1c75.html" title="User:Candy-Panda">Candy-Panda</a> 07:38, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would have to say this is a rather dumb assummption. Go see forums about berry, and school uniforms. You reason for that section being biased is also rather badly thought out. I actually went to sites to see if should add something to it, and you are relating yourself to a 3 page "explaination" about it. Now, do you even have the mangas? You replies are implying you don't. If you havent seen anything sites about it, I suggest you dont assume that it is all biased.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bottom line is, Wikipedia is not a place for "opinions" whether they be the fan's or your own. Simple as that. "Opinions" are biased. Wikipedia is supposed to be 100% "neutral". You can't just go around to fan forums and fan sites and add their opinions to Wikipedia. If you want to write about fans' "critism" of Berry's character flaws, do so on your own userpage or fansite or whatever, Berry's Wikipedia page is NOT the place for it. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECandy-Panda_1c75.html" title="User:Candy-Panda">Candy-Panda</a> 08:02, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Tokyopop's manga + Mew Mew Power?..</span></h2>
<p>I think that the main <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokyo_Mew_Mew_9bc3.html" title="Tokyo Mew Mew">Tokyo Mew Mew</a> article is just <b>too</b> huge. Even if we cut out some parts of the TE section, the article is still pretty large. Mostly because of the description of all alterations in Mew Mew Power and Mew Mew: Amiche Vincenti, and also because of the TE section.</p>
<p>My idea is to take out the Mew Mew Power section and the TE section, and place them together into a separate article, like it is done in the <a href="../../../s/a/i/Sailor_Moon_f7f9.html" title="Sailor Moon">Sailor Moon</a> article. Of course, it would be better to do it after we finish with the damned "reborn" thing.</p>
<p><a href="../../../y/u/m/User%7EYume_no_Kishi_995f.html" title="User:Yume no Kishi">Yume no Kishi</a></p>
<p>"What would be a good title for the article about the other versions of the anime? I was thinking "International Versions of Tokyopop (anime)" since if I can get info about the spanish version, portugese version n such, but I'm not sure...hm.."</p>
<dl>
<dd>Or "Tokyo Mew Mew around the world"...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Well, I went to look at the Sailor Moon article again. It has a brief description of the thing in the main article, and a separate page for a more detailed description of the English version (Mixx manga and DiC/Cloverway dub). However, the Sailor Moon story is much longer than Tokyo Mew Mew, even without the Sailor Stars anime series, and Mew Mew Power is only the first half of the anime dubbed into English, so... Other versions aren't mentioned in the article at all.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, <i>Project WikiMoon</i> does have a section about "Sailor Moon" in other countries. Moreover, each dubbed version has a separate page with a detailed description of the alterations. In our case, all stuff can be placed on the same page.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In that case, the main TMM article can be shortened by cutting a part of the MMP section (and replacing it with a link to the new article) and cutting out the whole TE section and Italian dub section. I personally think that the TE section shouldn't stay in the main article, as it attracts too much attention because of its size and the OR banner, and it also will remain the main target of vandals, even if we find some proof for the "reborn" thing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>How are we going to keep the TE section alive, I have no clue. We're already hated by 90% of TMM fans for stating that "ribbon" was a mistake, and until somebody else says the same thing, they'll continue calling us... *cough* not very clever people. I came across one LJ, whose owner commented on our "reborn" explanation, pretty much the same way as most TMM fans do (i.e. "two Wikipedia users say it's "reborn" just because a character from "Sailor Moon" says this, and it's stupid..." etc.) This thing really annoys me, especially when these people claim that they know Japanese. Would you believe them? Geez, I said long time ago that I personally don't really know Japanese, yet I was able to notice the mistake. (I stared at that "Strawberry Check" pic for ten minutes, and then freaked out, realizing that the word was mistranslated <i>everywhere</i>.)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The TMM talk page needs archiving again. I think both parts of the mistakes discussion can be archived now.</p>
