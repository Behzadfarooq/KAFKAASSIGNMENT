<dd>Hey - I can't imagine there's much of any real historical interest in Angmering, but I suppose you never know what lurks beneath the surface...

<p>Hi. I noticed that you recently changed both BBC ONE and the BBC page to say that the station was taken off air at the conclusion of the Mickey Mouse cartoon. I've always understood that it was in the middle of the cartoon, hence the use of the phrase "rudely interrupted" and the re-showing fo the "unfinished" cartoon when the BBC returned. Do you have a reliable source that indicates that the cartoon finished? <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMintguy_20fd.html" title="User talk:Mintguy">(T)</a> 16:08, 12 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>If I recall correctly it weas a summer replacement for Saturday Superstore (or whatever it was in that era). It was a children's programme but probably appealed to adults (like me) in the same way Tiswas did. To be honest though, the only bit I remeber of it was the dubbed Flashing Blade, I think I used to just tune in just for that bit (this was when I used to work a saturday morning shift as a computer operator [lots of free time on my hands]) <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMintguy_20fd.html" title="User talk:Mintguy">(T)</a> 17:03, 16 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Looking through various sites on the web, it's listed as a children's programme.

<dd>Fair enough!&#160;:-) I was <i>very</i> young at the time, after all... I suppose I just didn't think that a dubbed version of <i>The Flashing Blade</i> would appeal to "the kids" and would have been more of an ironic affair for the adults...

<p>While I definitely appreciate you adding those, I'm afraid they are a bit redundant because of the Cast and Crew list links I've placed on every extant serial page. In particular, as I go through the serials, I'm going to be removing those sections as per the formatting I've been going by, so it may be wasted effort on your part. Again, I'm not saying you shouldn't, but I wouldn't want you to add them and then I remove them eventually. --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> 10:08, 17 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have just watched Mickey's Gala Premiere (which actually uses the spellings of both Premiere and Premier on screen). I downloaded the cartoon using peer to peer software and it completed downloading a short while ago.</p>
<p>The Garbo character does not say "ah tank ah go home".</p>
<p>The last words of the cartoon are the Garbo character saying "ah tank I kiss you now". It would appear that unless there is another Mickey Mouse cartoon in which "I think I go home" are used, that the original reporting of the last words being "ah tank ah go home" is actually wrong. I would imagine the fact that "ah tank ah go home" used to be a phrase identified with Garbo just much as "Ah vant to be alone" has lead to confusion over the years. Apparently Garbo is supposed to have said this once in a meeting with movie executives, and she meant going back to Sweden. Furthermore it would also appear that what I had previously believed, and is wideley reported, that the cartoon was interrupted is also wrong. So you appear to be correct about this.</p>
<p>In a way it's a shame, because the story of the BBC pulling the plug midway through the cartoon is more fun <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMintguy_20fd.html" title="User talk:Mintguy">(T)</a> 19:51, 22 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>You know, that "ah tank I kiss you now" rings a bell, I'm sure I've read that somewhere... At least we sorted out whether it was / wasn't pulled halfway through anyway. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngmering_21af.html" title="User:Angmering">Angmering</a> 19:57, 22 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Funny you should mention Garbo and 'I vant to be alone.' I've just watched the film 'Grand Hotel' (1932 if you believe what's on the Chinese packaging) and Garbo says 'I want to be alone' two or three times. Although she is playing the part of a prima-donna-type Russian dancer and hams up the accent, she doesn't say, 'vant' - so it's become apocryphal in that sense. That reminds me of all the excruciatingly wonderful imitations of Larry Olivier doing Richard III that we've seen over the years. Are they hammed up or what? Yet in the original film Olivier is pointedly underplaying the part - something quite striking in a Shakespearian actor of those days.--Storye book 13:32, 6 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To be honest I'm afraid I can't really remember what they were building behind Norfolk Terrace. I was also a Waveney person, but Norfolk was rather more photogenic in the snow, I thought. The biggest change recently has been the overhaul of The Hive / Union House, which they began at the end of last year and should - in theory! - have finished over the summer. I suppose I'll see tomorrow when I head back up for the start of my Third Year... <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngmering_21af.html" title="User:Angmering">Angmering</a> 16:27, 13 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. I've just added details to the <a href="../../../d/e/n/Dennis_Potter_d5dd.html" title="Dennis Potter">Dennis Potter</a> page, regarding <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Remembered_Hills_33b8.html" title="Blue Remembered Hills">Blue Remembered Hills</a> which was shown to great acclaim on the BBC on 30 Jan 1979. The play was published on VHS briefly by the BBC but it was deleted from their list long ago. I am currently trying to persuade the British Film Institute to re-publish Blue Remembered Hills 1979 under their own label. They hold an archive copy. If you are interested in supporting this effort, you can email Erich Sargeant, head of BFI Video, at erich.sargeant@bfi.org.uk with your views on the matter. They have already published Cathy Come Home and Jonathan Miller's Alice in Wonderland, because some of us nagged them to do that, so it shows they do respond to customer requests. Good luck. --Storye book 10:52, 5 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>''<i>Your original message:</i><br />
Any reason why you (well, I say you, I apologise if it was one of the other guardians of these pages!) have <i><a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Who_d5fc.html" title="Doctor Who">Doctor Who</a></i> stopping in 1984 and re-staring in 1986? True, there was an eighteen month gap between seasons twenty-two and twenty-three, but twenty-two ended in early 1985 and twenty-three began in late 1986. Although there was some worry at the time, the show was never cancelled, the twenty-third season was never anything other than delayed to the autumn rather than the spring, and the production office was never suspended or closed down.</p>
<p>The years it ran should therefore read: 1963-1989; 1996; 2005-</p>

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>This is a message to all users who were at one point of time or another actively involved in editing the "Years in television" articles.</p>
<p>I have developed a new format, that I am currently proposing to apply to all "xxxx in television" articles. If you could take a look at 1976 in television/Temp and leave your comments/objections/propositions at Talk:1976 in television/Temp, that would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>Please note that the Temp version is by no means final. It is there to give an idea of the new proposed structure. Please do not be critical of the actual layout; it will most definitely not stay unchanged.</p>
<p>Any ideas you might have will be quite welcome. Thank you for your time.—<a href="../../../e/z/h/User%7EEzhiki_e732.html" title="User:Ezhiki">Ëzhiki (erinaceus amurensis)</a> 21:11, May 27, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I posted a question at <a href="../../../c/o/m/Talk%7ECome_Dancing_4d5f.html" title="Talk:Come Dancing">Talk:Come Dancing</a>, but later, when researching the article's history, noticed that it was you who changed the 1998 end date to 1995. Could you, please, let me know what your sources were? Also, would you happen to have the exact dates of when the show started and ended? Do you know if it ran continuously from 1949 through 1995 (1998), or were there gaps? I tried to look this up myself, but the information I am finding is very contradictory. I am trying to perfect the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976_in_British_television_eebf.html" title="1976 in British television">1976 in British television</a> article so it could be later used as an example for other years, and would very much like to see it free of any mistakes.

<dd>I'm afraid I've forgotten now what my 1995 date source was... However, checking the page for the show on the official BBC website <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/classic/comedancing/" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/classic/comedancing/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, they too give the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a> date, so it might perhaps be best to go with that. I'm pretty sure though as it said by BillyH on the talk page that regular series stopped in 1995 and subsequent editions to 1998 were specials. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngmering_21af.html" title="User:Angmering">Angmering</a> 10:14, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<p>Are you certain the influence didn't come till later?
