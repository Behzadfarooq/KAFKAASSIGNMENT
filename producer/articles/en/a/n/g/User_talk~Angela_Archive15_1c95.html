<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_Archive15_1c95.html" title="Edit section: New languages">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">New languages</span></h2>
<p>I have been recently updating the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Requests_for_new_languages" class="extiw" title="meta:Requests_for_new_languages">meta:Requests for new languages</a> page trying to make it more clear what needs to be done to start a wiki in a new language. I'd like to have someone from the Board look it over to make sure I'm not being presumptious -- the previous procedure was confusing, apparently ad hoc and seems to have left requests in limbo for a long time.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'll have a look tomorrow. (update: I think the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Policy_for_wikis_in_new_languages" class="extiw" title="m:Policy_for_wikis_in_new_languages">Policy for wikis in new languages</a> needs to become official policy before that page can be sorted out).</dd>
</dl>
<p>Since you are also a developer, I presume you have the power to make a new language wiki?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't have that ability. Tim removed my shell access just before he quit.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If so, there are sixteen languages listed (in their own <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Requests_for_new_languages#To-be_created" class="extiw" title="meta:Requests_for_new_languages">section</a>) which should be created AFAICT from existing policy (which basically says just to propose it and, barring any objections, ask a developer to set it up). There are a couple others which would be ready for creation but have no proposed code (and no official ISO code), so soon enough, I'll make sure this silly little obstacle is overcome and they will then be ready. Since many of the people who are proposing new languages presumably don't know English (or de or ja or fr or other big wiki language) very well, if at all, they may be uncomfortable with finding and asking a developer, so I'm trying to streamline the process. Is there some other step that should be taken? There is a proposed requirement for five supporting users, but this isn't policy as of yet, so I'm assuming all it takes is one.</p>
<dl>
<dd>No one has opposed the proposed policy, so I don't think it should just be ignored.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Anyway, I'm willing to work with the Board/developers on ensuring the most efficient system to do this, but there doesn't seem to really be a system right now, so I'm kind of making it up -- it appears the only way to get a wiki in your language at the moment is to pester Wikipedia-l in English, which is a bad system for developers, proposers and everyone.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think pestering wikipedia-l is more likely to delay a request than help speed up the process.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If there's no barrier to creation I don't know about, is there a specific developer in charge of creating new wikis?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Basically, new wiki requests have almost always been decided by Brion. I don't know what policy, if any, he follows for this, but there haven't been many objections to that, which is why I expect people are happy enough for this to continue rather than trying to create a policy for it.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'd actually like to remove the mailing list requirement altogether, since that seems rather un-wiki (and appears to be neither followed, nor very effective when it is followed).</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Anyway, sorry for the rambling message, I just hate to see these requests (and the potential momentum behind them) linger on in limbo. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 00:56, Mar 2, 2005 (UTC) (it would probably be best to contact me on <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:TUF-KAT" class="extiw" title="meta:User:TUF-KAT">my meta page</a>.) Another question: one of the sixteen languages is Mikasuki (no en article), a Native American language with no ISO code. The proposer recommended nia, a generic code for unclassified North American Indian languages. Is it considered acceptable to use such a code? <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 01:00, Mar 2, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No. I think we need a better policy of what to do for wikis with no code so they remain consistent with each other. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 01:25, Mar 2, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Angela,</p>
<p>Ko has a dilemma: on one hand there are few users are active and experienced, on the other hand there is hardly found someone is willing to talk freely of e.g. following problems with which ko is confronted.</p>
<ul>
<li>It has happened pretty frequently that users move or redirect pages erroneously. There was even IP user who moved pages manually, since move action needs login, or since they will be anonym. It's not a matter of reason for moving article, but a matter of rules of move or redirect. It is common rule that history of moving article must be in any case kept. But that is not the case in point; history is not only lost, but also user who does this action appears unjustly as contributor of article. A very doubtful transaction! I do not think users who do it are not aware of this blunder. They are not newcomer. Moreover, I have recently edited much help pages and emended so that one learns easely rules and attentions like of move or of redirect. Although I've referred to this error, admins don't take any notice of it. Would you point out on <a href="../../../../ko/%EC%82%AC/%EB%9E%91/%EB%B0%A9/%EC%9C%84%ED%82%A4%EB%B0%B1%EA%B3%BC%7E%EC%82%AC%EB%9E%91%EB%B0%A9.html" class="extiw" title="ko:위키백과:사랑방">ko bulletin board</a> what admin should do in this and other case.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps a help page like <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_fix_cut_and_paste_moves_8038.html" title="Wikipedia:How to fix cut and paste moves">Wikipedia:How to fix cut and paste moves</a> would help? I don't think the problem is that "admins don't take any notice of it" but that there are not enough admins. I tried nominating a couple of users as admins there a while ago, but both refused the nomination. There's only one active admin. A wiki with over 6700 articles really needs more than that. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>I've also asked weeks ago for deleting a amount of pages as having violated copyright. They could be deleted by <a href="../../../../ko/%EB%AC%B8/%EC%84%9C/%EC%82%AD/%EC%9C%84%ED%82%A4%EB%B0%B1%EA%B3%BC%7E%EB%AC%B8%EC%84%9C%EC%82%AD%EC%A0%9C_%EC%A7%80%EC%B9%A8.html" class="extiw" title="ko:위키백과:문서삭제_지침">the deletion policy</a> I've recently also new edited.

<ul>
<li>Another problem: I've indicated that Allmessages must be revised since Mediawiki version 1.4 has been installed. But nothing has happened (e.g. see Upload page and Login). So far as I know, Brion VIBBER has one times corrected <a href="http://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki:Minoreditletter" class="external text" title="http://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki:Minoreditletter" rel="nofollow">Minoreditletter</a> <a href="http://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki:Newpageletter" class="external text" title="http://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki:Newpageletter" rel="nofollow">Newpageletter</a> on the Recent Change.

<p>I have reason to believe that a Wikipedian is being railroaded by another Wikipedian through the agressive use of sock puppets in a Request for Comment action. The Wikipedian that I think is using sockpuppets has already had a formal complaint placed against him last fall for the same behaviors.

<p>Hi, I've been told that you are the person to talk to if I would like to revoke my admin privileges. I'd like to do this as I'm leaving the project. This has nothing to do with being against the ideals of the project - they are wonderful and most likely achievable in some form, or anything to do with Wikipedia's perceived unreliability (though there are some issues that need to be worked on), or in fact anything to do with anyone I've encountered on Wikipedia! I just need to make a clean break with the project (though I might do he odd edit here and there). It's not fair for me to retain those privileges when I won't be contributing anymore.</p>
<p>I'd like to say that Wikipedia is <i>the</i> most amazing software project I've ever worked on. It will be wonderful when (and if) Wikipedia 1.0 gets released! Please, keep up the good work. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 13:48, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I and my family are being threatened by <a href="../../../c/u/m/User%7ECumbey_f99f.html" title="User:Cumbey">User:Cumbey</a>, who also believes I am hacking into the wiki database! Can you take a look; it is all about different interpreatations of <a href="../../../j/a/v/Javier_Solana_a15f.html" title="Javier Solana">Javier Solana</a>. She believes he is the antichrist, and has taken great offence to my removing this thesis from the article. --<a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 19:31, Mar 14, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The main threat is to tell the police here I have a stash of marijuana; this based on my interest on Rastafarianism. I think it is aamn empty threat as she doesn't know where I live, only in <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Ceiba_0958.html" title="La Ceiba">La Ceiba</a> in <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honduras.html" title="Honduras">Honduras</a>. Things are not like in the UK/US here. No-one wants the negative attentions of the police. She has absolutely no justification for thinking I am in possession of marijuana, i.e. just attacking. But to unjustly and without cause bring the police here is, in my opinion, a threat to me and my family. but it would not be appropriate to ring the police, I feel. I have no idea whether making false claims to the police is an offence here, I would guess so, but getting the police involved in one's false cklaims can do a lot of damage to the other party.</p>
<p>The other charge she is making is that I hacked into the wiki data base; she wants to see me go down for a long time for this. I know the Honduran authorities would not investigate this without hard evidence. At wikipedia she also accuses <a href="../../../h/i/e/User%7EHierarchypedia_2bac.html" title="User:Hierarchypedia">User:hierarchypedia</a> of being my sockpuppet. These last 2 spurious allegations make me question her mental health, which is partly why I am concerned.</p>
<p>She knows my name (from my talk page) and is threatening to smear it all over the net. She writes my name all over her talk page, and I removed all the references.</p>
<p>The basic problem as she sees it, I think, is that I am working for Javier Solana in order to remove the evidences she placed in the article proving that he is the antichrist. She has told me she is going to write to Jimbo Wales demanding to see the hard discs (to get evidence that I have been contaminating them, doctoring the evidence, etc, and also to demand that he reinstate her version of the Solana article. And I thought I was here to write encyclopedia articles. --<a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 23:16, Mar 14, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
She thinks I have befriended the new editors on the Solana article, because they are not telling the truth the way she sees it either. If she goes ahead with pursuing Jimbo she may then start to blame him for manipulating evidence, etc, as well. I think she thinks I am a personal friend of his (don't know him). I hope she will just go away, but am concerned she won't.</p>
<p>Anyway many thanks for your note. You were recommended as a good person to come to. I am at the end of my tether with all this. --<a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 23:33, Mar 14, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I now think Cumbey, in her threats to turn me over to the Police for supposed marijuana use, is persecuting me for my religious beliefs. While her threats have only come through email, the conversation about religion certainly began at wikipedia. I decided to express a Rasta philosophy, telling her it states clearly states in the bible that Haile Selassie is God, and her response was that I am mad, and to threaten to call the authorities about what she falsely alleges is my secret stash. I think given the conversation about Christianity and Rastafarianism. Religious persecution is unacceptable. There is nothing I have ever written on wikipedia which could be construed as meaning I use cannabis. What do you think Wikipedia's attitude to this might be.</p>
<p>She still seems to think I hacked in to wiki data bases. if she makes either of these allegations public I will sue her for damaging my reputation as someone who doesn't break the law. I have the resources, so at least I am clear about my potential response to her threats. As another user said, she is not acting like a Michigan lawyer should act.</p>
<p>I took your advice and have permanently retired from <a href="../../../j/a/v/Javier_Solana_a15f.html" title="Javier Solana">Javier Solana</a>. I have left the article in good shape, and with a lot of people working on it who are interested in Solana as a politician.

<p>Hi, Angie. I'd prefer telling you good news about the proyect, but that's no t exectly the case. I could thanslate most of interfce into quechua, but it's not enought. The principal matter is that... I'm the only one here&#160;:'(&#160;! Anyway, I've been looking at the other wikis and their systems. I've get to a conclusion: If we don't advance with the wiktionary (in quechua, <b>Wiksimitaqi</b>) idea's dead. So, I've made the request page for sysop switching as meta's new rules says, but nobody's helpin'. So, I've wonder if could you help with that matter. It's worst that wikipidiya, beacouse it has just a lonely page:the main page.

<p>Hi, Angela,</p>
<p>There is as yet no one who is a bureaucrat at Wikiquote, but things have been getting busier there, and I would like to become one, so that more people can become sysops. So far I remain the most active one there, but there are a few people who have been making extensive edits who I think should probably be made into sysops within the next few weeks. I recently felt the time had finally come to protect the Main Page there, because it was increasingly becoming a target for spam vandals and others.</p>
<p>I have <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User_talk:Jeffq#Interested_in_becoming_a_Sysop.3F" class="extiw" title="q:User_talk:Jeffq">already asked</a> one highly active user, <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Jeffq" class="extiw" title="q:User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>, if he would be interested in becoming a sysop, and he <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User_talk:Kalki#Interested_in_becoming_a_Sysop" class="extiw" title="q:User_talk:Kalki">has confirmed</a> that he would. In many ways I actually think he would make a better sysop than I am, because he seems more constantly online, has proven himself skillful at creating convenient layouts on many pages that he has worked on, and seems more willing to engage in much of the dialog that is necessary on any wiki project. If I was given bureaucrat status, I would immediately make him a sysop, and within the next week or so would probably ask at least two or three other users who have been active lately if they would be interested as well. Whether I am made a bureaucrat or not, I believe that Jeff Q and a few others certainly deserve to be given sysop status soon. ~ <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKalki_80e0.html" title="User:Kalki">Kalki</a> 19:17, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Happy Easter, Angela. A week has now passed, with a little to spare, and so far nothing but positive votes and comments for myself, Jeff Q, and the other users that I nominated a couple of days later. Though I had expected to be busy this week with other things, I had ended up being much busier than I thought, and the need and usefulness of more sysops at Wikiquote has become more obvious than ever. I am eager to start the process of adding to the ranks of admins there as soon as possible; If I am to be given bureaucrat status, I would like test out the ability with Jeff Q. The other users who were nominated, and who haven't declined the privilege would likely be due to become sysops by this Wednesday. Thanks for all your work everywhere in the Wikimedia realms. ~ <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKalki_80e0.html" title="User:Kalki">Kalki</a> 19:45, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Angela. Saw your reverts to this article. Just wanted to let you know that those changes were made in very good faith and intention: i) To remove the not factual unconfirmed reference that Bromberg was falling out of use, and little simplification of speech (German instead of German Language) -- I had to delete a link in order to do that, as text was not directly inserted and ii) include a more straightforward reference and to the point (I think) reference to the status of the city after 1945. I lived n Warsaw, visited Bydgoszcz several times and liked it very much&#160;:) Thanks. <a href="../../../b/b/i/User%7EBBird_9f27.html" title="User:BBird">BBird</a> 22:45, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. I’m writing in order to find out what I should do in case I have permission to use images. First I give you a little explanation:</p>
<p>I have been writing about Icelandic music in the Spanish version using album covers under the fair use criteria. Now as it seems to be out of the question, lots of images are in danger of being lost. But I got permission to use these images from both: musicians (2) and record companies (3). I have no intentions to use images to promote, but only to report (you know what I mean: I’m a Wikipedian!).</p>
<p>How should I proceede? The templates used for albums are designed to include image covers, so what clasification should I provide on each corresponding description page?</p>
<p>I particularly tend to upload images no larger than 250 px wide (JPEG) and I don’t think there is a reason to consider this as an infringement of copyright laws. I’m willing to exchange some ideas with you in order to avoid making egregious mistakes.

<p>Greetings Angela. I've been heading up <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImages_and_media_for_deletion_08f4.html" title="Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion">Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion</a> for a while now, deciding whether there's consensus to delete on the many humdrum cases that come up. But the debate on <a href="../../../a/u/t/Image%7EAutofellatio.jpg_1467.html" title="Image:Autofellatio.jpg">Image:Autofellatio.jpg</a> is a hot item now, with close to a hundred votes already, and it's quite a special case. I was wondering if I could solicit your help in counting the votes. It's going to be rather close, and I'm quite sure there will be many people crying "foul" no matter how the issue is decided. It's also rather complicated, with some users voting with very few edits to their name, and others with votes contingent on other decisions. If you're willing to help with the vote counting, I'd be delighted. If not, what neutral and respected person would you recommend?

<p>Thanks for your answer. I knew it was possible to include images of this nature only through fair use.

<p>Hi Angela,</p>
<p>Do you know how the older version of POTD used to work?.</p>
<p>Today, I came across a couple of users who include</p>
<dl>
<dd>{{msg:pic_of_the_day_{{CURRENTDAYNAME}}}}</dd>
</dl>
<p>on their user page. However <a href="../../../p/i/c/Template%7EPic_of_the_day_Tuesday_6035.html" title="Template:Pic of the day Tuesday">Template:Pic of the day Tuesday</a> and similar are stuck on POTDs from last November, because no one has been updating them since the move over the the newer auto-archive version of POTD. However, I noticed that you've edited some of these pages before <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolitude_2d63.html" title="User:Solitude">User:Solitude</a> took over.</p>
<p>I was thinking to replace each of the [Template:Pic of the day <i>Daynames</i>] with a redirect to <a href="../../../p/i/c/Template%7EPic_of_the_day_1344.html" title="Template:Pic of the day">Template:Pic of the day</a>, but I wasn't sure this would do the trick and it would lead to some double/tripple redirects. There also seems to be a set of MediaWiki:Pic of the day Tuesday, but I have no idea what they are for (interface messages?).</p>
<p>An alternative might be to update each user page linking to the older templates and then delete the POTD-Dayname templates. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 18:43, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think redirects would be better than deleting them. I never followed how the new version of them worked so I might not be the best person to ask about this, but as far as I can tell, redirecting them all to <a href="../../../p/i/c/Template%7EPic_of_the_day_1344.html" title="Template:Pic of the day">Template:Pic of the day</a> should work. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 10:14, Apr 9, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks Angela, I think <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolitude_2d63.html" title="User:Solitude">User:Solitude</a> left sometime around last December (which is a shame), but I spotted your reply on his talk page. My guess is he may have been the last one to know how the previous system worked. Nevertheless I'll take on the tidying up and hope I don't break anything that matters. Most people are using the new mechanism, so the only bit that gives me pause for thought is the MediaWiki link. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 11:38, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_Archive15_1c95.html" title="Edit section: Fair use and the Spanish version">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Fair use and the Spanish version</span></h2>
<p><b>Spanish version against fair use:</b><br />
On your last message you asked me whether there was a consensus against fair use images and that I could upload them in other versions.<br />
Yes, it was determined by November 2004 that fair use was no longer available there. Administrators next to several users voted in favor of using free-license images only. But before getting into deep details, let me tell you a little more of my work there and my thoughts:<br />
I started by mid 2003 and thought I could be an integral part at the Spanish version for one big reason: only 2% of Internet content is in Spanish and my topics of interest are mostly unavailable in my mother tong. So I immediately began to write articles about music, I started with Beck and Björk, and as I saw it was too much to write about I decided that I would devote almost entirely to Icelandic music and thus I would complete an entire area of interest. Of course I have other passions: astronomy and geology, next to some economics issues.</p>
<p>Several of my works there are huge, and I’m known for having written the largest articles, where 12 of them were selected as outstanding. As the time passed by I managed to published almost 500 articles of varied quality. But things started to get nasty: first I discovered that some images of the biographies had been deleted because I delayed in justifying their existence, then when I wrote about an article titled “Heavily Indebted Poor Countries” I was accused of discriminating poor countries and that it was unfair that I didn’t mentioned the rich countries that are heavily indebted as well. But the title of my article is correct because it was a definition from the Club of Paris, the IMF the World Bank and other creditor institutions. It is an official term used for countries that have a certain amount of income and their debts go beyond a particular percentage threshold. When I tried to give explanations I was ordered to delete my article, but I refused because of the ignorance about those topics and because of the disrespect embodied in a meaningless argument. I was about to drop out, but chose to go on. Later I found this of the fair use and that really annoyed me. I mean, don’t you think all Wikipedia’s versions should have the same rules? After all Wikipedia’s server is located in the USA and it doesn’t matter where you’re writing from. Everybody could lie and anyway, Internet reaches all the corners of the Earth. For instance, the German version is more restricted, and a German guy told me that some images there are prohibited due to copyright laws, but where is the solution in banning images on the German version if you could get the other versions there? Does the language make a difference?</p>
<p>I complaint about the decision against fair use on my version explaining that I couldn’t vote because I was out but at least I gave some arguments. I got an answer from a virtual foe I have there: he even questioned my attitude of having images at my user page saying that I should create my own Web site. Just imagine this: What could a person like this say about your user page? That is ridiculous. Anyway, I chose to go on again. But once more, things got even nastier: the same foe (an administrator) started to promote the deletion of some articles devoted to Beck’s singles. He said I was trying to create some sort of a “CD catalogue”, then when I gave my explanations and arguments in favor of the existence of those articles, besides telling him that they hadn’t been finished at that time, he answered back arguing that he agreed that some singles could be important, but he found the others “irrelevant”, a word that ruffled my feathers and reacted with a rather sarcastic sense of humor. Then he told me that those articles were “microstubs”. So, I know he’s editing under a biased position, but I’m the only one who seems to see this.</p>
<p>I’m currently working here, because I have more freedom and it is nice to count on people who are always extending a hand to help you out. It is beautiful and strange to explain, but my passion for writing articles has been revived here again. I will translate into English my Spanish articles and span my areas of interest in the future.</p>
<p>I no longer care about the Spanish version: it’s all up to them to make the right decisions. If they are willing to harbor these biased behaviors I don’t think it would be wise to support their attitude with further collaborations. And now everybody there is wondering why the Spanish version has been lagged behind by the English one…. I think you have the answer now.

<p>I’m <a href="../../../../ka/s/o/p/User%7ESopho_28e7.html" class="extiw" title="ka:User:Sopho">Sopho</a>, one of the two administrators of Georgian Wikipedia. Luckily Georgian Wikipedia is working quite well. During last few months several people started working on it and the contributions are praiseworthy.

He has been contributing to different Wikipedias (especially, in Esperanto) since 2002. He has elaborated more than 2000 articles. Now he’s working very seriously on Georgian Wikipedia and, in my opinion, he’s perfectly skilled for the position of an administrator. My usual professional activities and circumstances require from me taking “Wikipedia breaks”. One of them is waiting for me very soon and I think it would be useful and reasonable if <a href="../../../../ka/%E1%83%90/%E1%83%95/%E1%83%97/User%7E%E1%83%90%E1%83%95%E1%83%97%E1%83%90%E1%83%9C%E1%83%93%E1%83%98%E1%83%9A.html" class="extiw" title="ka:User:ავთანდილ">Avtandil</a> is also able to carry out some actions that right now are beyond his responsibility. <a href="../../../../ka/m/a/l/User%7EMalafaya_3c3f.html" class="extiw" title="ka:User:Malafaya">Malafaya</a>, the other administrator of Georgian Wikipedia, agrees with this suggestion.

<p>As usual, Angela, your efficiency and hard work put my efforts to shame. I'm sorry to have "hit the wall", so to speak, at a time when the Mediation Committee deserved better. Thanks for your work at RFM -- I'll do what I can to assist, but I'm feeling a need to take a break come on, before I lose my patience with some people here.

<p>Hi angela, i make serbian RC now look like in english Wiki. Thank you. But i have another question, how to insert some special characters at the bottom of the edit area.

<p>Hi there, Angela. At ka:, we currently have this slight "problem". Despite my effort of putting a localized version of LangKa.php at the Developer's Request page, that request has not been attended to date. Currently, we are introducing categories and surely it would be better if we started creating with the correct georgian name instead of english "Category:Whatever". So, my question is, could you work into changing the namespace Category: into georgian name <i>კატეგორია:</i>? We think it's better to start with just one change and evaluate the impact we will be having with other namespace changes as well. Thank you a lot -- <a href="../../../../ka/m/a/l/User%7EMalafaya_3c3f.html" class="extiw" title="ka:User:Malafaya">Malafaya</a> 00:12, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Angela.

I found out that this was on account of the &lt;h2&gt; tag that you had inserted with that welcome message.

<dd>Thanks, Angela. It seems there is a "slight" problem. We recently asked for namespace names change at <a href="../../../../ka/index.html" class="extiw" title="ka:">Ka Wikipedia</a>. Apparently, these namespaces are being the same for Wiktionary, meaning the Project namespace is called <i>Wikipedia</i> (in georgian) instead of an equivalent to <i>Wiktionary</i>. I'm deducing that if I ask to change to Wiktionary, also Wikipedia will have its namespace called Wiktionary. How can I change the namespaces names for Wiktionary alone without affecting Wikipedia?

<p>Hi.

<p>Hello. In the past, I think you've spoken in favor of having guidelines on the serial comma in the WP Manual of Style.

See also that editor's <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Davy_ccbc.html" title="Edward Davy">Edward Davy</a> for a very POV article. There are also edits on pages from before he signed up properly which I am suspicious of. I feel this guy could, with some proper training be a good editor, since seems to be an avid researcher. The problem is going to be to direct him to the Wikiway, if he will not take advice. I don't know enough about the topics he writing about to make edits of them. Its just the POV language of it all.

<p>I noticed from the last deletion debate about his eponymous article that you had participated and were presumably familiar with at least some of his self-promotional efforts. These have continued to the present in some less overt and I believe more deceptive ways, particularly through the use of two anonymous IPs to reinsert his name into articles and on requested articles (which he has denied, rather implausibly based on the contribution histories of those IPs). Particularly because you're one of the most experienced Wikipedians around, I would appreciate it if you would take a look at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Daniel_C._Boyer_0fed.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Daniel C.

<p>Anything you can do to help me trim the fat, so to speak, on the RFC would be appreciated, though I think the older stuff is necessary to show context for the present behavior. He's continued to turn this into a farce, btw, by trying to start an RFC on me because he claims references to his inclusion of his sister's name constitute a separate dispute from his self-promotion, as if writing about family members is somehow not included in <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_page_2e5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity page">Wikipedia:Vanity page</a>, but I already explained to him the main reason was to tie his username edits to the edits of one anonymous IP.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_comment/Daniel_C._Boyer&amp;diff=13750918&amp;oldid=13750835" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_comment/Daniel_C._Boyer&amp;diff=13750918&amp;oldid=13750835" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> I've spent far too much time on this mess as it is (though I'm glad I managed to document the bulk of his problematic edits in one place), so I would appreciate it if you or anyone else interested in reining him in could lend a hand. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 20:41, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Angela. It looks like the Wikisource issues have been solved for good.</p>
<p>Since it is now all over, I decided I should apologize to two specific people whom I am aware I drove crazy while the whole argument was going on, namely: you and Tim Starling.</p>
<p>I do apologize for bothering you overly much about this at the time. In the end, it turns out you were right anyways: Despite my view that the board can (and probably should) take action on basic policy issues, including multilingualism, you were nevertheless right to be very hesitant about interfering in the case of a project that had already been up and running for quite a long time.</p>

<p>Angela,</p>
<p>I've been working on an image that looks like it could be the great grandfather of your Iceberg. I really like the detail you have below the water. I wonder if you could share with me the image (I won't copy it) and tell me a little about how you did the changes to the underwater part? Who knows? You may indeed be a graphic artist!</p>

<p>Hey Angela: Aloha! Hola! Hi! Bon Jour! Uh La La! lol....I havent spoken tp you in a long time!</p>
<p>I wanted to ask you, someone told me that either you or <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_Knott_a4ea.html" title="User:Theresa Knott">Theresa</a> are the ones to bring promotional ideas to. Being Spice Boy, I have a lot of fashionable as well as practical items on mind that we can sell for wikipedia's promotion. By the way, I'd love being in the <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spice_Girls_4805.html" title="Spice Girls">Spice Girls</a>, which in that case would have been called The Spices instead as me being Spice Boy, well...LOL not only do I love dressing like a woman but I think each of them is HOT and I have their temperament (when not provocked into arguing, that is!)</p>
<p>So tell me, is it you or Theresa that I have to take my ideas to?</p>
<p>BTW I have given you a barnstar. I saw everything you do on your user page and out of my heart I gave it to you because you deserve it.</p>

<p>Hello I found your name among the names of administrators. i don't know why I intend to share the problem but I feel you can give a a hand to me.</p>
<p>A few days ago I joined wikipedia and started to make some scientific pages about the field I am expert it, which is loop quantum gravity. I made a few pages but after a few days I saw that some people have placed a VfD above it to vote about one of my articles. I was fine at all. there where some positive votes and some negative one. But after a while I realized that three users/admisn started to delet some positive votes, attacked to the point of others by calling them ignorant. I did not know what to do so I found vandalism in progress page and complained there. At that they they threated me to delet the page if I place another report about it in there and placed a vandal protection above the article and VfD, it which was directing people to the discussion page of the article and the sentence was something like this: the content of the pages is protected until the discussion in here (the link to the discussion page of the page -and not to the vote page) is in progree. people were discussion in there about the article but after 8 hours, the article by one of their friends was deleted. I complained in adalism and they again deleted the complain and finally blocked me for 1 day. i don't know what was wrong me. I do not have enough encouragement to write another article for wikipedia. Please read the discussion in here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Hamidifar" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Hamidifar" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> and the vote page and tell me how can i overcome the networking?</p>

<p>Hi Angela,</p>
<p>Don't worry if you don't have time but Andy Mabbet has returned with avengance (children cower in fear) he has systematically scoured my work and listed a few pages as copyright control after many edits from others also, I have admited my crime and removed the offending "stuff" apart from <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham_military_history.html" title="Birmingham military history">Birmingham military history</a> and <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gun_Quarter_2be6.html" title="Gun Quarter">Gun Quarter</a> where by I emailed <a href="http://www.virtualbrum.co.uk" class="external free" title="http://www.virtualbrum.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.virtualbrum.co.uk</a> and the webmaster made a favourable comment, I really don't want to lose the pages with their google p.r., all I ask is that you see that fairness rules as I still am a part time wikipedian, even if I have to re-write the entire pages.

<dd>A comment as one who has been peripherally involved in this (and I hope achieved an amicable edit with Nick on some Birmingham topics): I think a deal of this is about misunderstandings, and perhaps Nick might take explanation of the spirit of Wikipedia better from you than from users who have been in conflict.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>1) Copyright. I certainly don't condone a certain other user's specific pursuit of Nick's articles, but the copyvio flags were accurate in my view. The thing to remember always is that recent works are in copyright by default, and that permission has to be verified all the way up from the original creator. Maybe Nick has been misinformed somewhere along the line about how copyright works?</dd>

<dd>2) Neutrality. A central clash of attitudes across many articles is about Nick's work on Birmingham having a promotional tone. Other people see the content he writes - which most certainly is generally good in terms of factual content - as having a relentless "gee-whiz-isn't-Brum-wonderful" spin, full of <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_peacock_terms_1e8b.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid peacock terms">peacock terms</a>, and so they edit toward <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neutral_point_of_view.html" title="Neutral point of view">Neutral point of view</a>. He, however, sees this response as being anti-Birmingham vandalism.</dd>

<dd>Thanks, Angela. This feud is poisoning the whole atmosphere of Birmingham-related articles. Whoever started it (and I can't untangle the origin), it'd be helped by both sides sticking to Wikipedia practices such as citing sources and documenting via edit summaries. I think another important point - and this comment also isn't directed at Nick alone - is to edit courteously and specifically. If disputing an individual sentence, it causes bad feeling all round to simply revert to several versions back, erasing edits by other editors on unrelated points. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERaygirvan_e1df.html" title="User:Raygirvan">RayGirvan</a> 17:49, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

It is intesresting to note that you arrived in the Brummie discussion at the same time as one Andy Mabbett who was also (as he claimed, an editor of pudding magazine etc.)</dd>

<dd>"it causes bad feeling all round to simply revert to several versions back, erasing edits by other editors on unrelated points." ~ mmm, think how annoying it is when you carry out weeks of research on a subject to ensure it is correct and then create an article only to find it deleted just because someone doesn't like it, I can assure you that copyright is part of the internet, it is also part of education, I have absorbed thousands of words from all matter of subjects on the internet and books and T.V. and education and I could quite easily re-write much of it in a similar form, how do you think that innovation works... the internet is a tool for education, a prime example is an article I took from Virtualbrum, after contacting the owner he admited the text was taken from a plaque on a wall, where did that come from, a bloke in a museum that probably took it from a book that he read, about a family in the Gun Quarter that was written by a guy that lived in the same street that gathered the information from people he knew and a quick shifty through the city library archives.</dd>

<p>Ok, maybe it's not the right way for doing so. First of all, presentation: I'm Gatto Nero, user of the <a href="../../../../it/index.html" class="extiw" title="it:">Italian Wikipedia</a>. Second of all: sorry for my awful english, i will try to make me understand. And now, let's go with the explanation.</p>
<p>'cause some users - i'm one of them - are launching a project for helping local wikis connected to the italian one (sicilian, sardinian, friulian...), we started to "have a connection" with this local realities, and we began to note some problems. I'm writing to you for one of these. I paste here a text we were preparring to explain our problem. I would have had time to refine it, but now I suuggest we should hurry up a bit&#160;:D</p>
<dl>
<dd>"While helping in Wikipedia:Babel for some templates and declaring I was Sardinian, some other it.wiki users suggested me to have a look to sc.wiki. I entered it and logged in on May 17th and I started translating some articles. After a short time, I realised that another (anonymous) user had rollbacked the paged to a previous version, telling me, in English, not to intervene only to change the dialect but to only use SUL (Sardinian unified language). Since I'm not a linguist, I had a look to the suggested website and I noticed it is a study carried on in Nuoro province by an academic and his co-workers. This (not yet completed) study follows on a 2001 proposal by a commission of experts on behalf of Region Sardinia. The proposal has never been ratified. Some of the components of the commission have moved away from the results. Some other professors and co-workers are carrying on a SUL project in different regions (with different pronounciation as well). Some reference websites: Campidanese-Barbaricino [<a href="http://www.ditzionariu.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ditzionariu.org" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>], Campidanese [<a href="http://www.limbasarda.it/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.limbasarda.it/" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>], Campidanese-Cagliaritano [<a href="http://www.sardu.net/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sardu.net/" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>], Logudorese [<a href="http://www.faeddos.iofm.net/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.faeddos.iofm.net/" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>], finally Barbaricino-Logudorese "imposed" by the anonymous user [<a href="http://www.uls.it/321.page" class="external text" title="http://www.uls.it/321.page" rel="nofollow">inoghe|SUL</a>]). This is to show that I took really seriously what was indicated to me and I investigated deeply. I investigated on the past evolution of sc.wiki too and I noticed that other attempts to modify the main page have been frustrated by the same user in the same way. In the meantime I started a discussion page-village pump, to discuss about the language with all users. No one but the anonymous user showed up. Since the first discussions I noticed that this user is neither Italian nor Sardinian (all Sardinians speak Italian). I got no answer on the means he uses to edit articles in Sardinian (I made clear my background, both in terms of Sardinian and vocabulary used). Up to now he hasn't given either an opinion or a proposal but: "We use SUL Sardinian". But he isn't able to indicate me a SUL dictionary! I have advanced, IMHO, a more democratic and appealing proposal, even for (potential) new users. No answer. Tonight 24th May, without any consultation, this user has completely modified <a href="../../../../sc/p/a/g/Pagina_Printzipale_a671.html" class="extiw" title="sc:Pagina_Printzipale">the main page</a> and a new user showed up to help him. I'd like an opinion on the matter, on my behaviour in the past and in the future.. The fact a user is not Sardinian is meaningless, but as I don't feel authorised to impose my POV, he shouldn't as well (IMHO). The discussions can be seen on <a href="../../../../sc/z/i/l/Wikipedia%7EZilleri_3c05.html" class="extiw" title="sc:Wikipedia:Zilleri">sc:Wikipedia:Zilleri</a>. <a href="../../../../sc/t/e/m/user%7ETemugin73_dc51.html" class="extiw" title="sc:user:Temugin73">user:Temugin73</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Temugin is an active user of the sardinian wiki. <small>(<i>quite the only active user, i think, but this is n-NPOV</i>)</small>. Why are we writing to you? Cause one of these two anonimous users has become <a href="../../../../sc/m/6/4/User%7EM64_c87b.html" class="extiw" title="sc:User:M64">User:M64</a>, that you nominated admin for sc.wiki. Now we - I, at least - are a little bit worried about this: i don't think he's adapt for being an admin...</p>

<dl>
<dd>Hi Angela, thanks for the answer&#160;:D</dd>
<dd>I knew this situation could have been really confusing... 'cause at the beginning i was confused too. I'll try to make things clearer:
<ol>
<li><b>"Sides":</b>
<ol>
<li><a href="../../../../sc/t/e/m/user%7ETemugin73_dc51.html" class="extiw" title="sc:user:Temugin73">user:Temugin73</a> He was a quite brand new it.wiki user, but he works hard. Cause he's from sardinia, some user suggested him to help with sc.wiki, that's why he started work on it.</li>
<li>Some "ip-users" (i think two)... one of them shoud have been become <a href="../../../../sc/m/6/4/user%7EM64_c9f1.html" class="extiw" title="sc:user:M64">user:M64</a>. They're really push on the Unified Sardinian Language (USL/LSU). Really: they change the spelling of every page to make it use the ULS. They make it without a discussion, just change. I think that - in a complicated situation like this - this way of acting is not so <i>wiki-style</i></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>I object to what you have said here. I have acted only in a most polite way, and when Temu requests that I don't change his orthography any more I stopped. The portrayal that I am crazy antiwiki forcing LSU on people is strange, I think LSU is the best idea but if it is ddecided democratally to use a non-LSU I will be disapppointed but will not hurt the dicision. (m64)</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li><b>LSU problem:</b>
<ul>
<li>LSU is just a convention... a study that some professor made over the sardinian dialects. The problem is the Unified Sardinian Language... is not so unified. No-one except these doctors use it. The team that was working over USL splitted in more team, everyone working on a different version. There no USL-dictionary to be used by other users. How could other wiki-users write in a language they don't know?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>This is incorrect. The LSU is not a study. It is a set of regulations, which you can find in Sardinian, Italian, and English (I don't know if you can find the English version online, but the Sardinian and Italian versions you can). I am a native Sard speaker and I have checked. This orthography is the official in the province of Nuoro, which is 1 of the 4 old provinces of Sardinia (now there have been 4 new provinces added recently, so that complicates things a bit). This LSU is not developped just by this one professor but by a team of experts, including famous Sardinian language-experts like R Bolognesi and E Blasco Ferrer. It does not have strict guide (tell how to spell a specific word) but instead general rules (how to spell a specific sound), so a dictionary will not be nessecary. I am not sure these people have even read the pages of LSU because it makes so clear all that I have said before. It is taught in the schools in Nuoro as well, and used for the official doccument . It is true that it is not used by a large portion of population, but it is the only one existing standard for Sard. "unified" means dialect-neutrality, not that all people use it. And remember as I had said before, even though I think its best to use it, I will not try to force it. (m64)</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li><b>Some notes:</b>
<ol>
<li>Cause sardinian is splitted on 4 dialects (they are not so much), i started working on a template which will indicate in which dialect a page is written in. This template will give the possibility to new users to write the same page in one of the other dialects.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>The 4 dialects of Sardinian are splitted huge, so that one cannot always understand the other. I think it will confuse us all too much. (m64)</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Temugin suggested - and this is really wiki-love, i think (n-NPOV) - to use USL only on comunitary page, and let users use the dialect they want on articles page.</li>
<li>A study on a unified sardinian language could will be made once sardinian community will grow up. With only three users it's impossible.</li>
<li>I'm on Temugin's side (but i think this could be easily understandable&#160;:D)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Why I think M64 should not be admin? For all these reason: an admin should talk about an action BEFORE making this action. An admin should try to amalgamate different vision to make born a "community version". And i think that M64 is too much involved in USL studies (but it's my sixth sense... really n-Npov suggestion).</dd>
<dd>For all this reason, I'd prefer if sc.wiki have to have an admin for now - Temugin as admin. But now i think there must be only a temporary admin...</dd>

<dd>ps: I forgot! M64 seems not able to speak in italian, not in a specific sardinian dialect too. Yes, sardinian is not a dialect of italian, but we are deeply culturally, historically and geografically linked, so it's strange that someone is not able to talk in italian...
<dl>
<dd>He has confused me with this other anonymous user who says he speaks English only. I used Italian in discussion a lot here. (m64)</dd>

<dd>If I may chime into this discussion: I'm <i>not</i> a user of the sardinian Wikipedia either, but I partecipate in the project of the italian Wikipedia to support our "little sisters" (sc.wiki, fur.wiki and so on). In my opinion it is important that some "outsiders" of sc.wiki but with good Wikipedia experience take part in this discussion. Beeing maybe only 3 active users in total, it is no way representative that 2 users are in favor of "USL" and 1 is not. We need some people who will consider carefully the arguments of both sides and take part in the decision on how this project can be run. (I can help translating between italian/english; should we contact wikipedia-l about this?) I think that as long as this basic decision has not been taken, the project should be stopped and could even do without an admin. Once the decision has been taken, all those who have taken part in the discussion should decide on a new sysop whom they trust to stick to the decision taken. --<a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeonard_Vertighel_f7dc.html" title="User:Leonard Vertighel">Leonard Vertighel</a> 13:11, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I think it would be best to discuss the dispute on the mailing list, either Wikipedia-l or WikiIt-l and for the community to decide which users they want as admins there. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 13:28, May 27, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Also I do not mind the dis-admining. But I do not appreciate this non-Sardinian assuming expert on Sard language politics and attacking against me, remember Gatto Nero says he is not Sardinian. He has a lot of untruths and misconceptions. It upsetts me to portray in such a distorted way as a non-human or who is anti-wiki. (m64)</p>

<p>Hey Angela, Just saw you change <a href="../../../n/o/o/Noobcake.html" title="Noobcake">Noobcake</a> to a redirect. I was about to list it for speedy since the person adding the tag apparently neglected to do so. I also listed Mryano as a possible vandalism-in-progress, though I noted that it's likely he's just a new user experimenting. (I also left a welcome on his page.) Since you edited it, I won't list it. Just thought I'd bring you up to date.--<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeJ9919_0983.html" title="User:MikeJ9919">MikeJ9919</a> 04:58, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd already deleted <a href="../../../n/o/o/Noobcake.html" title="Noobcake">noobcake</a> earlier, but since he kept recreating it, I decided to redirect it since people are generally less likely to overwrite a redirect than to recreate a deleted article. I have no objection to it being deleted though. If you add a {{delete}} tag, you don't actually need to list it anywhere, since it will automatically be in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Category%7ECandidates_for_speedy_deletion_4c9c.html" title="Category:Candidates for speedy deletion">category:candidates for speedy deletion</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 05:03, May 28, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Excuse me, but you seem like a competent administrator. Some time in the past I performed "manual" moves before I became properly aware of the faux pas of doing so. Perhaps you can perform the delicate task of fixing the history of them in your capacity.</p>

<p>Hey Angela. Thanks for making me an admin, it's a great bonus to be able to fix all those nigglying grammar mistakes. Just one question, to change the interface, all I do is edit <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/LanguageGa.php" class="extiw" title="m:LanguageGa.php">m:LanguageGa.php</a>? Or do I need to download something/do something more tricky? Also, what's the story now with beaurocrats, I take it I'm not one, will I tell other admin-hopefuls to go to the requests for permission site?

<p>My anger over his edits was justified. By editing my user talk page (which has a personal association to me) he was attributing - or not attributing - speech to myself which I did not approve of. Whether or not my warning was allowable by wikipedia standards of conduct is irrelevant. I have not at any point waved my ability to control speech attributed to me (nor is that lawful) neither by virtue of public domain or by verbal contract nor have I waved my access to seek legal remifications should any sort of backlash (not that I expect it should) as a result of those comments attributed to me occur - regardless of wikipedia's bylaws which appear to ban the threat of legal sanction. - A clear violation of the right to habeas corpus in the United States. The law extends beyond the codes of an irrelevant encyclopedia.</p>
<p>Besides, by formally taking control of this IP address I am excluding the further "contributions" of former users who appear to have: 1. Created an imaginary country and 2. Vandalized various wikimedia articles. In short, I might be a mean nasty, irritable law school student with too much caffeine and too little sleep - but at least I am preventing further vandalism.</p>
<p>And all I expect in return is that I have the full, unabated control over everything that is said under my IP number - which is a right garunteed to me.</p>
<p>You have a nice day.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Forgive me for eavesdroping. Some points:
<ul>
<li>You do not have a <b>user</b> talk page. If you want one, you have to become a <b>user</b> first. Try clicking the "login" link somewhere at the top-right corner of every page. Indeed, if "someone else" is using your IP address, then it isn't really "yours", is it? How, exactly, are you going to "formally take control" of an IP address that others are also using?</li>
<li>Your understanding of law with regard to public access websites is somewhat faulty. <a href="../../../h/a/b/Habeas_corpus.html" title="Habeas corpus">habeas corpus</a> doesn't mean what you seem to think it does.</li>

<p>Hi Angela, don't know where to ask. My password for the account of the same name on <a href="../../../../ta/index.html" class="extiw" title="ta:">Tamil wikipedia</a> has been cracked and the e-mail address is also probably changed. I'm not able to access it. Before the password for this account is also changed, do something about it. There are several evidences linking this user id in en wikipedia with that. Also it has been linked to my e-mail id (sundarbecse in yahoo domain), since I've e-mailed <a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERavidreams_68c6.html" title="User:Ravidreams">User:Ravidreams</a> on both the Tamil wiki and the English wiki. Also, since I'm an admin there (and also here) it needs to be blocked immediately before any damage is done. -- <a href="../../../s/u/n/User%7ESundar_8811.html" title="User:Sundar">Sundar</a> (<a href="../../../s/u/n/User_talk%7ESundar_d2f1.html" title="User talk:Sundar">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sundar_568f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sundar">contribs</a>) 05:01, Jun 2, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Angela, after long discussions I have finally been reassured that sc.wikipedia will be a team work (including new users, of course). I have no objections for anyone with sufficient technical skills to become an administrator with full powers (M64 included). Thanks again for allowing us to talk. At the same time, I would like to candidate myself as administrator for the <a href="http://sc.wiktionary.org" class="external text" title="http://sc.wiktionary.org" rel="nofollow">Ditzionariu</a>. As for the sc.wiktionary, I'd rather wait until Sunday midnight in case someone may object and vote against me.

<p>My apologies, I didn't know we had a bureaucrat, but the issue I raised still stands. There have been many requests for adminship that he hasn't listened to. There are plenty of grammar mistakes all over the interface(thankfully I was able to correct a good few, but there's still plenty) and he won't correct them. Check out the <a href="../../../../ga/r/i/a/Vicip%C3%A9id%7ERiarth%C3%B3ir%C3%AD_4451.html" class="extiw" title="ga:Vicipéid:Riarthóirí">ga:Vicipéid:Riarthóirí</a> site to look at the requests for adminship, none of which have been granted, it looks as if the guy hasn't even looked at the page. Also, his Gaelic is sub-par, it would be better if admins in the Gaelic wikipedia could speak the language.</p>
<p>Also, I already set up an election for a bureaucrat, <a href="../../../../ga/t/o/g/Vicip%C3%A9id%7EToghch%C3%A1n_Maorlathacha_48a9.html" class="extiw" title="ga:Vicipéid:Toghchán_Maorlathacha">here</a>.
