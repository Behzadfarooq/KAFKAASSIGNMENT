<p><b>Ange-Félix Patassé</b> (born <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_25.html" title="January 25">January 25</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1937.html" title="1937">1937</a>) was President of the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_African_Republic_87d3.html" title="Central African Republic">Central African Republic</a> from <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a> until <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, when he was deposed by the rebel leader <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fran%C3%A7ois_Boziz%C3%A9_7b9d.html" title="François Bozizé">François Bozizé</a>. Patassé was the first president in the CAR's history (since 1960) to be chosen in what was generally regarded as a fairly democratic election (1993) in that it was brought about by donor pressure on the Kolingba regime and assisted by the UN Electoral Assistance Unit. He was chosen a second time in a fair election (1999) as well. However, during his first term in office (1993-1999), three military mutinies in 1996-1997 led to increasing conflict between so-called "northerners" (like Patassé) and "southerners" (like his predecessor President <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andr%C3%A9_Kolingba_efb9.html" title="André Kolingba">André Kolingba</a>). Expatriate mediators and peacekeeping troops were brought in to negotiate peace accords between Patassé and the mutineers and to maintain law and order. During his second term as president, Patassé increasingly lost the support of many of his long-time allies as well as the French, who had intervened to support him during his first term in office. Patassé was ousted in March 2003 and now lives in exile in <a href="../../../t/o/g/Togo.html" title="Togo">Togo</a>.</p>

<p>Patassé was born in <a href="../../../p/a/o/Paoua.html" title="Paoua">Paoua</a>, the capital of the northwestern province of Ouham Pendé in the colony of <a href="../../../u/b/a/Ubangi-Shari_a529.html" title="Ubangi-Shari">Ubangi-Shari</a> in <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Equatorial_Africa_82d4.html" title="French Equatorial Africa">French Equatorial Africa</a>, and therefore he has often mistakenly been assumed to belong to the Kaba ethnic group which predominates in the region around Paoua (Bradshaw 1998). Patassé's father, Paul Ngakoutou, who served in the Free French military forces during the Second World War and worked for the colonial administration in the Province of Ouham-Pendé after the war, was a member of the Suma subgroup of the Gbaya people and was raised in a small village to the northeast of Boguila, on the road to Markounda. Patassé's mother, Véronique Goumba, belonged to the Kare ethnic group of northwestern Ubangi-Shari. Patassé is thus a Suma on his father’s side and a Kare on his mother’s side. Nevertheless, because he spent much of his youth in Paoua he has always been associated with Ouham Pendé province and many of his most loyal political supporters have been <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kaba.html" title="Kaba">Kaba</a>. After attending school in Ubangi-Shari, Patassé studied in the Agricultural Institute of Marmilhat in <a href="../../../p/u/y/Puy_de_D%C3%B4me_3b44.html" title="Puy de Dôme">Puy de Dôme</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, where he received a Technical Baccalaureate which allowed him to enroll in the Superior Academy of Tropical Agriculture in <a href="../../../n/o/g/Nogent-sur-Marne_6048.html" title="Nogent-sur-Marne">Nogent-sur-Marne</a> and then in the National Agronomical Institute in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>. Specializing in zootechnology, he received a diploma from the Center for the Artificial Insemination of Domestic Animals in <a href="../../../r/a/m/Rambouillet.html" title="Rambouillet">Rambouillet</a>, France. He finished his studies in Paris in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a>, a year before the independence of the Central African Republic.</p>

<p>Patassé joined the Central African civil service in 1959, shortly before independence. He became an agricultural engineer and agricultural inspector in the Ministry of Agriculture on <a href="../../../1/_/j/1_July_1963_5949.html" title="1 July 1963">1 July 1963</a>, under President <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Dacko_bb6b.html" title="David Dacko">David Dacko</a>. In December <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a>, Dacko appointed him Director of Agriculture and Minister of Development. In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean-B%C3%A9del_Bokassa_c27a.html" title="Jean-Bédel Bokassa">Jean-Bédel Bokassa</a> took power in a coup d'état. Patassé was the "cousin" of President Bokassa's principal wife, Catherine Denguiade. Patassé gained the confidence of the new president and he served in almost all the many governments formed by Bokassa (exceptions including short periods of several months in 1974 and 1976). He served as Minister of Development (1 January 1966 - 5 April 1968), Minister of Transport and Energy (5 April 1968 - 17 September 1969), Minister of State for Development, Tourism, Transport and Energy (17 September 1969 - 4 February 1970), Minister of State for Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, Waters, Forests, Hunting, Tourism and Transport (4 February 1970 - 25 June 1970), Minister of State for Development (25 June 1970 - 19 August 1970), Minister of State for Transport and Commerce (19 August 1970 - 25 November 1970), Minister of State for the Organization of Transport by Roads, Rivers and Air (25 November 1970 - 19 October 1971), Minister of State for Civil Aviation (19 October 1971 - 13 May 1972), Minister of State for delegated by the President of the Republic for Rural Development (13 May 1972 - 20 March 1973), Minister of State for Public Health and Social Affairs (20 March 1973 - 16 October 1973), Minister of State delegated by the President of the Republic for Missions? (16 October 1973 - 1 February 1974 [at which point he left the government briefly for health reasons], Minister of State for Tourism, Waters, Forests, Hunting and Fishing (15 June 1974 - 4 April 1976), Minister of State serving as Agricultural Councilor for the Head of State (10 April 1976 -24 May 1976), Minister of State for Tourism, Water, Forests, Hunting and Fishing (24 May 1976 - 4 September 1976). After Bokassa's creation of the Council for the Central African Revolution (in imitation of Libya's government council), Patassé was named a member of the Council of the Revolution with the rank of Prime Minister in charge of Posts and Communications, Tourism, Water, Forests, Hunting and Fishing, as well as Custodian of the Seats?? of State (4 September 1976 - 14 December 1976). During this period Patassé followed Bokassa in briefly becoming a convert to Islam (October 1976 - January 1977) and changed his name to Mustafa Patassé. After Bokassa became Emperor Bokassa I, Patassé was named (7 December 1976) Prime Minister and Head of the first Imperial Government. He remained in this position until 14 July 1978, when a public announcement was made that Patassé had stepped down from office due to health problems. Patassé then left for France, where he remained in exile until the overthrow of Bokassa in September 1979. Shortly before Bokassa's overthrow, Patassé announced his opposition to the Emperor and founded the Front for the Liberation of the Central African People (Front de Libération du Peuple Centrafricain) or FLPC.</p>
<p>Emperor Bokassa was overthrown and President David Dacko restored to power by the French in 1979. Dacko ordered Patassé to be put under house arrest. Patassé attempted to escape to the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chad.html" title="Chad">Republic of Chad</a>, but failed and was arrested again. He was later released due to alleged health problems.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/g/Ange-F%C3%A9lix_Patass%C3%A9_0695.html" title="Edit section: 1980s: Return to politics and further exile">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1980s: Return to politics and further exile</span></h3>
<p>Patassé returned to the CAR to present himself as a candidate for the presidential election of 15 March 1981, after which it was announced that Patassé gained 38% of the votes and thus came in second, after President Dacko. Patassé denounced the election results as rigged, which they clearly were. Several months later, on 1 September 1981, General <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andr%C3%A9_Kolingba_efb9.html" title="André Kolingba">André Kolingba</a> overthrew Dacko in a bloodless coup and took power, after which he forbade political activity in the country. Patassé felt obliged to leave the CAR to live in exile once again, but on 27 February 1982, Patassé returned to the CAR and participated in an unsuccessful coup d'état against General Kolingba with the help of a few military officers such as General François Bozize. Four days later, having failed to gain the support of the military forces, Patassé went in disguise to the French Embassy in order to seek refuge. After heated negotiations between President Kolingba and the French, Patassé was allowed to leave for exile in Togo. After remaining abroad for almost a decade, of which several years were spent in France, Patassé returned to the CAR in 1992 to participate in presidential elections as head of the Movement for the Liberation of the Central African People (MLPC). The donor community, with the fall of the Soviet Union, saw no need to prop up the Kolingba regime and so had pressed for change helping to organise elections with some help from the UN Electoral Assistance Unit and with logistical support from the French army.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/g/Ange-F%C3%A9lix_Patass%C3%A9_0695.html" title="Edit section: 1990s: Return to power">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1990s: Return to power</span></h3>
<p>After the Kolingba regime foolishly sabotaged a first set of elections in 1992, which Patassé would have probably won, a second set of elections were held and on the second round on 19 September 1993, he came in first, defeating Kolingba, David Dacko and <a href="../../../a/b/e/Abel_Goumba_7317.html" title="Abel Goumba">Abel Goumba</a>, and took office on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_22.html" title="October 22">October 22</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a>. Largely thanks to the foreign pressure notably from the USA and technical support from the UN, for the first time the elections were fair and democratic. Patassé thus became the first president in the nation's history to gain power by such means. He had the support of most of his own Gbaya people, the largest ethno-linguistic group in the CAR, as well as the Kaba people of his "hometown" of Paoua and the Kare people of his mother. Most of his supporters lived in the most populous northwestern savanna regions of the CAR, and thus came to be called "northerners", whereas all previous presidents were from either the forest or Ubangi river regions in the south, and so their supporters came to be called "southerners". As a populist, Patassé promoted himself as a candidate who represented a majority of the population against the privileges of southerners who held a disproportionate number of lucrative jobs in the public and parastatal sectors of the economy. As President, Patassé began to replace many "southerners" with "northerners" in these jobs which infuriated many Yakoma people in particular who had benefited from the patronage of former President Kolingba. During Patassé's first six-year term in office (22 October 1993 - 1999), the economy appeared to improve a little as the flow of donor money started up again following the elections and the apparent legitimacy they brought. Unfortunately there were three consecutive mutinies in 1996-1997, during which destruction of buildings and property had an adverse impact on the economy. The first mutiny began in May <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>. Patassé's government successfully regained control with the help of François Bozizé and the French, but his obvious dependency on the French against who he had regularly railed, reduced his standing further. His subsequent use of Libyan troops as a body guard did nothing to help his reputation, either locally or with the donor community and the USA even closed their embassy temporarily. The last and most serious mutiny continued until early <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>, when a semblance of order was restored with the help of troops from <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burkina_Faso_dfc4.html" title="Burkina Faso">Burkina Faso</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chad.html" title="Chad">Chad</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/b/Gabon.html" title="Gabon">Gabon</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/l/Mali.html" title="Mali">Mali</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/n/Senegal.html" title="Senegal">Senegal</a>, and <a href="../../../t/o/g/Togo.html" title="Togo">Togo</a>. The Security Council of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> approved a mission for peace, MINURCA, in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>. MINURCA was made up of 1,350 African soldiers. These mutinies greatly increased the tension between "northerners" and "southerners" in the CAR and thus polarized society to a greater extent than before. In the presidential election of September <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>, Patassé won easily, defeating former presidents Kolingba and Dacko, winning in the first round with about 51.6% of the vote. Opposition leaders accused the elections of being rigged. During his second term, Patassé who rule had always been erratic and arbitrary, became increasingly unpopular. In 2000, he may have had his former prime-minister <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean-Luc_Mandaba_9c81.html" title="Jean-Luc Mandaba">Jean-Luc Mandaba</a> and his son poisoned on suspicion of planning a coup <a href="http://www.sangonet.com/ActualiteC3/Situationtendue14nov00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sangonet.com/ActualiteC3/Situationtendue14nov00.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. There were failed coup attempts against him in 2001 and 2, which he suspected Andre Kolingba and/or General François Bozize were involved in, but when Patassé attempted to have Bozize arrested, the general left the country for Chad with military forces which were loyal to him.</p>

<p>Patassé left the country for a conference in <a href="../../../n/i/g/Niger.html" title="Niger">Niger</a> in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, and in his absence Bozizé seized <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangui.html" title="Bangui">Bangui</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_15.html" title="March 15">March 15</a>. Although the coup was internationally condemned, no attempt was made to depose the new leader. Patassé is now living in exile in Togo.</p>
<p>Although nominated as his party's presidential candidate in <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_2004.html" title="November 2004">November 2004</a>, on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_30.html" title="December 30">December 30</a> Patassé was barred from running in the election due to what the constitutional court considered problems with his birth certificate and land title. He was one of seven candidates barred, while five, including Bozizé, were permitted to stand. After an agreement signed in <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libreville.html" title="Libreville">Libreville</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/b/Gabon.html" title="Gabon">Gabon</a> on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_22.html" title="January 22">January 22</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, all barred presidential candidates were permitted to stand in the <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_13.html" title="March 13">March 13</a> election except for Patassé, on the grounds that he is the subject of judicial proceedings. Patassé's party backed his last prime minister, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Zigu%C3%A9l%C3%A9_c556.html" title="Martin Ziguélé">Martin Ziguélé</a>, for president in preference to Patassé.</p>
<p>Patassé was accused of stealing 70 billion <a href="../../../c/f/a/CFA_franc_3beb.html" title="CFA franc">Central African francs</a> from the country's treasury. He denied this and in an interview with <a href="../../../a/g/e/Agence_France-Presse_c913.html" title="Agence France-Presse">Agence France-Presse</a> on December 21, 2004, he stated that he had no idea where he could have found so much money to steal in a country with a budget of only 90-100 billion francs. He was also accused of war crimes in connection with the violence that followed a failed <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> coup attempt, in which rebels from the northern <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo_6e9c.html" title="Democratic Republic of the Congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a> came to Patassé's assistance, but were accused of committing many atrocities in the process. Patassé, the Congolese rebel leader <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean-Pierre_Bemba_a8ec.html" title="Jean-Pierre Bemba">Jean-Pierre Bemba</a> (now the Vice-President) and three others were charged in September 2004. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4908938.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4908938.stm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> However, the government of CAR was unable to arrest them, so the courts <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cases_before_the_International_Criminal_Court_5c8e.html#Central_African_Republic" title="Cases before the International Criminal Court">referred the matter</a> in April 2006 to the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Criminal_Court_154c.html" title="International Criminal Court">International Criminal Court</a>.</p>
<p>In March 2006, the Central African government accused Patassé of recruiting rebels and foreign mercenaries, establishing a training camp for them on the Sudanese border, and planning to destabilize the country. <a href="http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=52162&amp;SelectRegion=Great_Lakes" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=52162&amp;SelectRegion=Great_Lakes" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://www.afriquecentrale.info/fr/news/news.asp?rubID=1&amp;srubID=4&amp;themeID=1&amp;newsID=3943" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.afriquecentrale.info/fr/news/news.asp?rubID=1&amp;srubID=4&amp;themeID=1&amp;newsID=3943" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>In August 2006 a court in the Central African Republic sentenced him in absentia to 20 years in prison after a trial over the financial misconduct charges.</p>
