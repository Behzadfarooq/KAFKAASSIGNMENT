<p>The route is best described as mountain-rural. Because the route passes through the protected Angeles National Forest, development is very limited. There are not many buildings between La Cañada Flintridge and Wrightwood save for Newcomb's Ranch, <a href="../../../c/a/m/Campground.html" title="Campground">campgrounds</a>, and <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visitor_center.html" title="Visitor center">visitor centers</a>. Other points of interest along the route include the <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mountain_High_e31d.html" title="Mountain High">Mountain High</a> ski resort and <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Wilson_%28California%29_a211.html" title="Mount Wilson (California)">Mount Wilson</a> (and its corresponding <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Wilson_Observatory_e622.html" title="Mount Wilson Observatory">observatory</a> and various radio/television transmitters). Depending on the local weather, i.e. no clouds or fog, impressive views of the Los Angeles basin are possible from the vicinity of Mount Wilson - the most significant limit of what can be seen is the density of the smog and/or marine layer covering the basin.</p>

<p>The westernmost segment of the highway, combined with <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angeles_Forest_Highway_7287.html" title="Angeles Forest Highway">Angeles Forest Highway</a>, is heavily travelled by southbound traffic in the morning (and corresponding northbound traffic in the afternoon) that is comprised of commuters who live in the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antelope_Valley_0170.html" title="Antelope Valley">Antelope Valley</a> and work in the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Los_Angeles_area_a039.html" title="Greater Los Angeles area">Greater Los Angeles area</a>.

<p>In contrast, the remainder of the Angeles Crest Highway is lightly travelled. Typically, this traffic is composed of vacationers, sightseers, and locals. Several snow ski resorts are located in <a href="../../../w/r/i/Wrightwood%2C_California_122f.html" title="Wrightwood, California">Wrightwood</a>, and surrounding mountain villages, so during the winter snow skiing/snow enthusiasts use this road as well.</p>

<p>Construction for Angeles Crest Highway began in 1929. It was originally intended to be a <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firebreak.html" title="Firebreak">fire access road</a>. In 1941 construction stopped because of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a>, after the war, construction resumed; the completed highway eventually opened in 1956.</p>
<p>Roads in the San Gabriel Mountains have a high number of single-vehicle auto and motorcycle accidents. As an example, in the predawn hours of <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_8.html" title="December 8">December 8</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, <a href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/NASA_van_rolls_off_California_mountain" class="extiw" title="n:NASA_van_rolls_off_California_mountain">a van plunged off the side of Angeles Forest Highway</a> at about 1 mile north of its junction with the Angeles Crest Highway, killing 3 of the 10 people in the van. The van was a <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carpool.html" title="Carpool">carpool</a> carrying workers of the <a href="../../../j/e/t/Jet_Propulsion_Laboratory_eec3.html" title="Jet Propulsion Laboratory">Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> from the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antelope_Valley_0170.html" title="Antelope Valley">Antelope Valley</a> to work in La Cañada Flintridge. It was determined upon investigation by the <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_Highway_Patrol_c03f.html" title="California Highway Patrol">CHP</a> that the driver fell asleep at the wheel of the van. The Angeles Crest Highway and Angeles Forest Highway have figured in various murders, not as scenes of the murder but as drop off points for the dead victims, including Linda Sobek, a model kidnapped and found dead in the area in 1994.</p>

<p>Intersections with other roads are few which can be problematic in the event of road closures due to acts of nature such as landslides and fires. At about the midpoint of the highway is the junction with the north terminus of <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_State_Route_39_394e.html" title="California State Route 39">California State Route 39</a>. However, access to State Route 39 is not possible as it is closed indefinitely to automobile traffic because of persistent landslides along its route. Therefore, travelers to the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angeles_National_Forest_c935.html" title="Angeles National Forest">Angeles National Forest</a> preferring the Angeles Crest Highway corridor should expect to be on the Angeles Crest Highway throughout much of its length, use available alternate routing where possible, or be willing to turnaround and 're-trace' their trip, at any point along its route if necessary.</p>

The Angeles Crest Highway closed since 2004.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Angeles Crest Highway is normally closed in the wintertime from Islip Saddle to Vincent Gap due to rockfall and avalanche hazards. However, the winter storms of 2004-05 caused several landslides and significant damage to the highway. Thus, the highway never reopened summer of 2005. Damage to the highway was estimated to be over 4 million dollars as of November 2005. Terri Kasinga, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Transportation, stated in November 2005 "It is definitely not going to open until next spring (of 2006)".<sup id="_ref-standish_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-standish" title="">[1]</a></sup> However, a March 2006 storm caused even more extensive damage to the highway including a complete washout of a large section of roadway, further delaying the reopening of the highway. Total construction costs now exceed 10 million dollars. Pending the availability of construction funds to repair this new damage, construction is anticipated to begin spring of 2008. As of now this portion of the highway has been closed since October 2004.<sup id="_ref-standish_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-standish" title="">[1]</a></sup> The closure of the highway has caused concern for the California Department of Forestry because it hinders firefighting.<sup id="_ref-gonzalez_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gonzalez" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="../../../c/e/l/Cell_phone.html" title="Cell phone">Cell phone</a> <a href="../../../r/e/c/Reception.html" title="Reception">reception</a> can be sporadic and, when available, signal strength and clarity is poor. Although the surrounding mountainous terrain is the primary reason for this, the limited presence of, and/or proximity to, cellular communication antennas (cell towers) to receive and transmit signals along the route contributes to the problem.</p>
<p>The Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act passed in December of 2004, protects the Angeles National Forest. Although anyone can park at the side of the road and access the <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilderness.html" title="Wilderness">wilderness</a> along the side of the road, doing so for extended periods of time, such as camping or hiking, requires a <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Forest_6469.html" title="National Forest">National Forest</a> <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Forest_Adventure_Pass_f472.html" title="National Forest Adventure Pass">Adventure Pass</a> available for a $5.00 fee.</p>
