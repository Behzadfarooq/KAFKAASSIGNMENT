<p>Hi Angr, I'm still learning the ropes and just saw that you did a lot of list cleanup today. I had totally missed the previous tanslations archive before&#160;:(. I've done several translations now but did my first proof-read yesterday. My question is this: After I proofread the article I took it off the list thinking this is what we are supposed to do so we know what's been done and what hasn't. Now, having found the archives, I'm not so sure anymore it was supposed to come off, unless the archives include only articles that still need proof reading. If the list includes all, whether proofread or not, how do we know which articles still need proofreading and which don't (other than checking around and clicking on user talk pages)? Please let me know and I'll put it back on the list if it's supposed to stay on. Thanks for your help. --<a href="../../../m/m/o/User%7EMmounties_8e5b.html" title="User:Mmounties">Mmounties</a> 14:40, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think there are rules about what is and isn't supposed to go into the archives. I just stuck a bunch of stuff there because the de-en translation page is huge and needs cutting down, and those things were more than a month old. I doubt anyone ever looks at them anyway; they're just there because you aren't supposed to permanently delete things. I wouldn't worry about it too much. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a> 14:49, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You are mistaken when you say the "grave accent is never used" on Italian placenames. Indeed, in many Italian reference works (such as atlases and dictionaries), it is standard to show stress when it is not on the penult (or when the word ends in two vowels, e.g. -ia) using a grave or acute. In principle, the grave is for open vowels and the acute for closed, but this distinction is not followed systematically.

<p>Hi Agr, that was a good question you asked on the missing articles/de talk page. How often do they do such dumps? (I've started to go through the list when I need a change of pace and eliminated some of the ones only listed there because of missing links.) Did I understand correctly that the last dump didn't even include all those they normally include because it would have been ridiculously many? Btw, I'm really grateful for the layout conventions on the pages across the wikis because it enabled me to, while I'm at it, to add the en: interwiki link to the other language articles as well that were linked from the German article. So now, after just a short time, I can say that I've modified cyrillic, japanese and other pages written in to me incomprehensible characters. &#160;:) Keep up the good work. I really like what we all got accomplished last week. --<a href="../../../m/m/o/User%7EMmounties_8e5b.html" title="User:Mmounties">Mmounties</a> 01:08, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know how often they do the database dumps. I'm not sure it's even organized. I too am under the impression the last dump excluded pages in German + three other languages excluding English, because there were over 2000 of them. And I too have enjoyed adding en: links to languages I can't read, thinking "Hmm.. this must be <b>Edit</b>... this must be <b>Save page</b>... I hope... let's see what happens..." <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<small><i><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a></i></small> 06:28, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I know you are not German, but if you have some time, would you mind having a look at this brand new notice board?

<p>What exactly do you mena, "stop adding original research to this page"? The added text about "Lord of the Dance" that you last deleted was well-sourced with four quoted links and well-balanced, with two sources on each side. It's only "original research" in the sense that all of Wikipedia is "original" -- it was written by someone with information to add, documented by external sources; and without it, the existing page for "Lord of the Dance" is less complete, omitting the highly controversial nature of the hymn. --69.76.70.190 04:05, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You're right, I'm sorry. I didn't look carefully enough the second time and thought you had simply reverted to your previous version, which <i>was</i> unsourced. I must say I never perceived the verse as remotely anti-Semitic, and that particular verse was a large part of the reason I had the hymn at my own wedding -- which, since I was marrying another man, would probably also have been called "a shame" by certain Christian "holy people". <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<small><i><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a></i></small> 06:32, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>With Userpages getting vandalized often, perhaps Wikipedia ought to just have it where only users can edit their pages. I figured I'd say this here since your page was a victim of many attacks. 144.126.161.43 03:50, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Angr, I just removed a request for expansion from the Noticeboard (Hesse-Hanau) because a search for Hanau hit an article about that town. I'd like to tag the sub-stub Hesse-Hanau for deletion. How do I do that? Thanks for your help. --<a href="../../../m/m/o/User%7EMmounties_8e5b.html" title="User:Mmounties">Mmounties</a> 18:21, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is <i>something</i> like a principality of Hesse-Hanau, see <a href="../../../../de/h/a/n/Hanau.html" class="extiw" title="de:Hanau">Hanau</a> and especially <a href="../../../../de/h/a/n/Hanauisch-Indien_2cc5.html" class="extiw" title="de:Hanauisch-Indien">Hanauisch-Indien</a>. However, I agree completely with the redirect as for now. To expand this would still be an interesting topic. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(è¨Žè«–)</a> 20:07, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, there was a <i>Graf</i> (count) of Hanau, so his lands would be called a <i>Grafschaft</i> (county), but even from the pages you pointed me to I'm not seeing evidence that there was a state called Hesse-Hanau distinct from the town of Hanau in the same way that the state of Hesse-Kassel was distinct from the city of Kassel. It would definitely be interesting to add more about the counts of Hanau to <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanau.html" title="Hanau">Hanau</a>, but I'm still not convinced there <i>ever</i> needs to be a separate page called <a href="../../../h/e/s/Hesse-Hanau_ef87.html" title="Hesse-Hanau">Hesse-Hanau</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<small><i><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a></i></small> 20:21, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am not certain about the territory of Hesse-Hanau, but it was large enough to be split between <a href="../../../h/e/s/Hesse-Kassel_03b4.html" title="Hesse-Kassel">Hesse-Kassel</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/s/Hesse-Darmstadt_01ac.html" title="Hesse-Darmstadt">Hesse-Darmstadt</a>.

However, I'm all for following the German example (as you did): the history of Hanau (even if it was <i>reichsunmittelbar</i> at some point) should be in <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanau.html" title="Hanau">Hanau</a>. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(è¨Žè«–)</a> 21:02, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Given the total number of edits, even though many of them were vandalism, you might have let the deletion vote run for more than 2 hours. Basically without a decent vote, the page is going to get recreated (not by me - I hasten to add) and I'm going to have to revert it six times a day. With a decent vote period at least there are grounds for deleting it on sight in the future.</p>
<p>My vote would have been <b>delete</b>. Anyway. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegapixie_ea09.html" title="User:Megapixie">Megapixie</a> 23:27, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
