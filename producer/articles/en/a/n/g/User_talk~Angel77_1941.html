<li>It is actually Fish Supper who has violated the 3RR (see below). Fish Supper accuses me of violating the 3RR. The first revert according to Fish Supper was actually when I reverted a one sentence change by Rev of Bru at 20:10). Fish Supper's first revert, on the other hand, changed the entire introduction, and I reverted this change only three times. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 21:21, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, The first revert was 18:53 as I mention above. Slrubenstein had made 6 by the time I reported this. Which is a clear violation of 3RR.</li>

<li>I believe it is relevant that I explained all my edits on the article's talk page, and Fish Supper provided no explanations for his/her revert. S/he characterizes my reverts as "unwarrented" when I provided detailed explanation for my changes. Needless to say, Fish Supper never responded to my explonation, or provided his or her own. Moreover, Fish Supper's edit summaries ("Naughty" and "Mouse Error") suggest vandalism. Clearly, Fish Supper is not concerned with the article contents, but only with reverting my work. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 21:21, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Fish Supper continues to revert any edit I make to the article. If this goes on, the effect is the same as if I were blocked from the article. Since I have always provided reasons for my edits, and sources when necessary or requested, and Fish Supper never does, this amounts to harassment. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 22:04, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>It would be a striaght forward 3RR by Slrubenstein however you are allowed to revert banned users. CheeseDreams is currently under an abcom ban.

<dd>What about (b)? As I said, at least Slrubenstein was discussing his edits on the Talk: page.

<dd>So? That is irrelevant. The 3RR policy is not "do not revert 3 times, unless you mention it in the talk page in which case you can revert as much as you like". It is DO NOT revert 3 times in one day, <i><b>ever</b></i>. So what about (b). Stop trying to come up with flimsy excuses and sidestepping of the issue and actually answer the question.</dd>

<dd>I remain unconvinced by your reasoning, although I do not deny that you are making a coherent argument. If you like, unban Slrubenstein. I make it a policy of not engaging in ban-wars.

<dd>I would not consider an unbanning by you to be "warring". I've made my position clear by banning. You would then make your position clear by unbanning. That's one "move" each. The fact that it results in Slrubenstein being unbanned if there's a "tie" is fine as I believe policy is that if there is a dispute as to whether someone should be blocked then we should err on the side of having them unblocked. It is only when one or both of us would seek to reassert our positions (by "reverting" to a different block state, for example) that it would be warring. Thus, you can ublock, but I won't reblock, and we'll be "even". --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDante_Alighieri_2b5c.html" title="User:Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDante_Alighieri_3f7c.html" title="User talk:Dante Alighieri">Talk</a> 23:56, Apr 19, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

This is the template to report violations from now on. Make a ***copy*** of the rest of this template ***above*** the "Report new violation" header, and fill in the fields appropriately. Do **not** edit **this** copy.
Note: "DiffLink" refers to a "diff" link from the history, not a link to a specific *version*; to get one, click the two radio-buttons on the appropriate adjacent history entries, then click on the "Compare selected versions" button, and then copy the URL of the page you are sent to, to get a  DiffLink. Doing this, rather than just linking to versions, makes it much easier for an admin to look at the violation you are reporting. See the example at the top of this page if needed.

<p>This is supposed to be your Talk page — a place for other editors to leave messages for you, and (possibly) for you to reply. The above is at best off-putting, and surely inappropriate. Aside from anything else, it merely duplicates large chunks of material that can be found elsewhere. I've deleted it from <a href="../../../n/e/w/Talk%7ENew_Testament_apocrypha_085d.html" title="Talk:New Testament apocrypha">Talk:New Testament apocrypha</a> and other article and User Talk pages; you're entitled to do what you want here, but you should be aware that it doesn't look good to those coming to leave a message. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 11:36, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
