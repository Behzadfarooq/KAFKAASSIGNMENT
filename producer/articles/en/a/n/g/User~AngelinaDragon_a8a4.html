	    <p>My name is Angelina; as I am sure you have guessed and I like dragons of just about any form. There are a few exceptions to this, but they are few.</p>
<p>I was born in Seattle, Washington in 1978 and lived in that state until 1998 then moved to Colorado and lived there until 2000 when I moved to the state of New Mexico where I have been living since.</p>
<p>I haven't always been known as Angelina, in fact it wasn't until recently that I have been going by my once unknown middle name. Later this year (2007) it will even be legally changed due to issues of identity theft. An adventure I rather not relive and do not recommend to anyone.</p>
<p>I have one son who was born in 2000 so it's quite easy to remember how old he is as long as people know what year it is. I don't really plan to have any more kids at this time, but that's not really saying to much since I didn't plan my first to the tune of I didn't know I was pregnant until contractions began at 4 pm. How could that be possible you ask? I was on (and am again) the drug Depo Vera (<a href="../../../d/e/p/Depo_Provera_caa1.html" title="Depo Provera">Depo Provera</a>) which is a birth control shot that is now given only in the hip every three months. Back in 1997 when I started getting this shot it was given in the hip or the shoulder and when I was living in Colorado in 1998/2000 the shoulder is where they would only give it to me, which they found out later, because of women like me becoming pregnant, giving the drug in the shoulder made it less effective. Because one of Depo's side effects is the loss of periods and my body did not show any signs of being pregnant I went the full nine months unaware of the growing boy inside of me. Of course I knew immediately what was going on once those contractions started having been through some animal medical school by then.</p>
<p>I am a certified Veterinary Technician; which simply means I can ask for a couple dollars more than a Veterinary Assistant and I have a little framed piece of paper. I have been debating recently about if I want to start Pre-Vet classes at UNM then decide where I want to take actual Veterinary classes or just work at the local zoo. Both are engaging and one could argue that I could do them both at the same time, but where would I work in my social life?</p>
<p>I have absolutely no idea what else you would want to know about me. I'm just another human being on this planet who is living out her life the best way she knows how. I may become famous someday, I may not. You might actually know me in real life or have talked to me online at one point or another, or perhaps not. You may like me, you may hate me, you may wish to stalk me or avoid me. You might not have even known I had existed until you happened across this article. Fact is I might not know who you are or that you exist. Or you could be my best friend, my brother, my sister or some other relative, the guy I love or the one I wish would just leave me alone. No one really knows when it comes to the Internet. That's the beauty of it, the absolute mystery of the person behind the keyboard.</p>
