<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I saw on your page a link to <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danish_beer.html" title="Danish beer">Danish beer</a> and a bunch of incomprehensible squiggles (which I took to be Danish). Would you care to expand the article on Danish beer? I'm curious to learn more about its character and history in general, and about more specific brewers than just Carlsberg. It's not something I know much about, so I thought I'd ask if you're interested; I'd definitely like to read more on it!</p>

<p>Hi there. I have a problem with a user called <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathrocker_4378.html" title="User:Deathrocker">Deathrocker</a>. This user was recently banned for removing sourced information from articles, and for making personal attacks at people who do not have accounts. This user is also on revert parole from an arbirrition case that led to him being banned for three months. This user is using a serious of ip adresses to revert any user, anmynous or registered that change anything on articles he deems as 'his' claiming it as vandalism or restricted user changes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=156.34.142.158" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=156.34.142.158" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=207.179.133.131" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=207.179.133.131" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=142.166.234.19" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=142.166.234.19" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=216.21.150.44" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=216.21.150.44" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=198.164.250.64" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=198.164.250.64" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=207.179.133.116" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=207.179.133.116" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=142.166.233.135" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=142.166.233.135" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. He also just used an ip to delete your post from my talk page and instead leave a personal attack <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A86.143.124.233&amp;diff=72794246&amp;oldid=72787176" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A86.143.124.233&amp;diff=72794246&amp;oldid=72787176" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>.</p>
<p>I ask if you can check these ips against his. I also ask if this user can be banned from these articles, as he has grown into a habit of calling admin abuse when he is banned, and removing large sections of text written by others on article discussion pages, claiming they are banned users. He has even done this to an admin, claiming admin abuse when the admin reverted him. This is on top of the persistant violations of his parole regarding personal attacks and using sockpuppets to perform massive reverts, which he openly admits to being his by signing them as himself <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A86.143.124.233&amp;diff=72794246&amp;oldid=72787176" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A86.143.124.233&amp;diff=72794246&amp;oldid=72787176" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>.</p>

<p>These were two editors that I was in arbitration cases with earlier this year (<a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Leyasu_595f.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Leyasu">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Leyasu</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Deathrocker_ddb8.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Deathrocker">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Deathrocker</a>). The arbitration committee placed limits on how often those editors can revert edits without being blocked. Leyasu violated the restrictions so often that he ended up being blocked indefinitely by another admin who wasn't previously involved in the dispute. That admin (<a href="../../../c/i/r/User%7ECirceus_e372.html" title="User:Circeus">Circeus</a>) posted on <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a> about that, and I and several others endorsed Leyasu's indefinite block. Earlier this month, Circeus added Leyasu to the <a href="../../../l/o/b/WP%7ELOBU_4a0a.html" title="WP:LOBU">list of banned users</a>, and no one has reverted that.</p>
<p>Deathrocker has been blocked a few times since the cases too, but he hasn't been blocked indefinitely. Leyasu claimed that Deathrocker is currently under a three-month ban, but that isn't true. Deathrocker has never been blocked for more than 1 month. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Deathrocker" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Deathrocker" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> I think Deathrocker is using IPs so that he won't be caught violating his revert parole, although he actually isn't violating it if he is reverting banned users.</p>

<dd>I think it was Deathrocker who changed your comment. His comment was right, but he was wrong to remove yours. It's pretty easy to figure out which one's which (Deathrocker or Leyasu) based on their typical editing patterns and IPs; they are in different countries, so their IPs would be substantially different. --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_Havaname_2e6d.html" title="User:Idont Havaname">Idont Havaname</a> (<a href="../../../i/d/o/User_talk%7EIdont_Havaname_2580.html" title="User talk:Idont Havaname">Talk</a>) 18:17, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Hi, I think page naming has led to some confusion, sorry about that.</p>
<p>The only page that I did delete was Long term abuse/Willy on Wheels, which was only a redirect. Note the absence of a "Wikipedia:" prefix on this page name; I deleted this because the absence of a prefix puts the redirect in the article namespace, and the WoW abuse page is not article material. This is simply one of many "cross-namespace" redirects that have been deleted recently. In short, <i><b>I did not delete "Wikipedia:Long term abuse/Willy on Wheels", only a redirect to it</b></i>.</p>
<p>The <i>target</i> of the redirect is the page I think you were looking for – the WoW abuse page itself, Wikipedia:Long term abuse/Willy on Wheels. (Note the "Wikipedia:" prefix this time). Wikipedia:Long term abuse/Willy on Wheels <i>was</i> later deleted, however, by <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a>, following a consensus to do so on <a href="../../../m/i/s/Wikipedia%7EMiscellany_for_deletion_06ab.html" title="Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion">MfD</a>. You may review the discussion that led to the page's deletion <b><a href="../../../m/i/s/Wikipedia%7EMiscellany_for_deletion_Wikipedia%7ELong_term_abuse_Willy_on_Wheels_2_9887.html" title="Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Wikipedia:Long term abuse/Willy on Wheels 2">here</a></b>.</p>
<p>The other pages you mentioned were deleted by <a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde">Cyde</a> and others following the conclusion of the MfD discussion. I assume their reasoning is the same as whoever nominated the WoW abuse page; I have played no part in the discussion, so I'm unsure as to the exact reasons. The WP:WoW redirect was deleted not by me but by <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a>. Since its target page no longer existed at that point it was eligible for speedy deletion (see <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#Redirects" title="WP:CSD">CSD R1</a>, "redirects to non-existent pages").</p>

<p>Thanks for that! I've spent the last couple of weeks writing a small program to help with vandal fighting (basically it reads through Recent Changes, picks out suspicious edits, and presents them to you one at a time), and yesterday I decided to try it out. From the response I've recieved, I guess it's pretty effective. Still needs improvement, though.

<p>First, sorry for such a late reply. I have been away for quite some time (:</p>
<p>Hm.. very interesting (: No, I didn't know that it meant that! It's very cool to find that out now though. I had mostly created it randomly, trying to make it sound like something from a North Germanic language. I initially had created the name before I went further into making my conlang, and before I had studied much Danish/Swedish/Norwegian.</p>
<p>So then, on to Stersken: Very sadly I have lost all my documentation (grammars, vocabulary, written texts) when my harddrive crashed recently. I can't afford at this time to get the data recovered therein. But I can tell you what I do remember from my head: it was indeed a mix or the North Germanic languages, with some English and German thrown in; the word order was most close to Danish and English; like German it showed four grammatical cases; as well, the definite article was suffixed to the noun.</p>
<table class="wikitable">
<caption>Here is an example declension of 'sprosk':</caption>
<tr>
<th rowspan="2">&#160;</th>
<th colspan="2">Singular</th>
<th colspan="2">Plural</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Indefinite</th>
<th>Definite</th>
<th>Indefinite</th>
<th>Definite</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Nominative</th>
<td>en sprosk</td>
<td>sprosken</td>
<td>sprösker</td>
<td>spröskern</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Accusative</th>
<td>ett sprosk</td>
<td>sprosket</td>
<td>sprösker</td>
<td>spröskert</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Dative</th>
<td>em sprosk</td>
<td>sprosksöm</td>
<td>em sprösker</td>
<td>spröskersöm</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Genitive</th>
<td>es sprosk</td>
<td>sproskes</td>
<td>sprösker</td>
<td>spröskeres</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>So, one can see the traditional Germanic Dative -m and Genitive -s suffixes. Also, a sort of joke by me was to split en/ett into Nominative and Accusative, respectively, as one can see in the table. There were no noun genders in my conlang. em/söm is just some fun irregularity that every language should have (:</p>
<p>I unfortunately only remember the pronouns and their declensions for I, thou, and it</p>
<table class="wikitable">
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>First Person Singular, I</th>
<th>Second Person Singular, thou</th>
<th>Third Person Singular, it</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>N</th>
<td>isk</td>
<td>du</td>
<td>den</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>A</th>
<td>mer</td>
<td>der</td>
<td>det</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>D</th>
<td>mer</td>
<td>der</td>
<td>dem</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The possessives were 'min', 'din' and 'dens' for 'isk', 'du' and 'den', respectively. Something that I have always wondered about is why there is a difference between the first person singular pronoun of North Germanic and other Germanic languages. I think it might have something to do with the orthographic 'g', which is sometimes pronounced as a <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voiceless_velar_plosive.html" title="Voiceless velar plosive">voiceless velar plosive</a>, or [k], which in extension often trades places with <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voiceless_palatal_fricative.html" title="Voiceless palatal fricative">voiceless palatal fricative</a> or <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voiceless_velar_fricative.html" title="Voiceless velar fricative">voiceless velar fricative</a> (German ich- and ach-Laute). Old Norse shows 'ek' for first person singular, but modern Icelandic shows 'ég'. I'm only an 'armchair linguist' (simply linguistics as a hobby, no formal study), though (:</p>
<p>I have one treasure you might enjoy. It's a story I wrote in Stersken about a pirate named Morsom Drepper. It is, as far as I know, the only surviving text I wrote:</p>
<p><b>An Moendagsoem var isk en Pyrat</b></p>
<table>

<p>The story is quite silly (:</p>
<p>In Stersken, as you may have noticed, the words show both influences from the <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_German_consonant_shift_54c8.html" title="High German consonant shift">High German consonant shift</a> and lack thereof. Some set phrases used in that text, that may not be clear: 'ladt' is the simple past form of 'läta' and 'den läta' is like German 'es gibt', literally "it lets .."; 'äje' - Ja! (but the pirate way); indefinite articles are used as relative pronouns.</p>

<p>Hi Mads, thanks for your comments regarding the newly started page on the Danish property bubble. I respect your opinion that the market may not be in a bubble, but I have to stress that the article doesn't say that it is. It merely says that some observers (including leading researchers in the Danish property market such as Jens Lunde) think that it might be a bubble. I'm somewhat pressed to see how you can think the current prices in CPH can be justified clearly there has been a significant correction going on since last summer. Some of it is showing up in the latest official stats. Living in CPH, and talking to friends and relatives my impression is that lots of stuff that happened in fall 2006, spring 2007 is not yet reflected. This is also supported by various aggregate data and data from real estate agents (which tends to have lower latency) such as Home, that claims that actual sale prices are now at 2005-levels. Sales prices seem to have decreased 15% in CPH while asking prices somewhat more. Nationwide I don't know how the state is or how the figures will turn out. I fully agree that the article needs more citations but I won't have time to fix it until next weekend. I can think of citations for all assertions in the article. Thanks for your suggestions!</p>

<dd>I find it interesting that you - as an economist! - have more faith in real estate agents (who after all earn their living by selling houses and obviously know that if buyers expect price falls they are not going to buy) than in independent economic organizations like <a href="../../../o/e/c/OECD_bdbe.html" title="OECD">OECD</a> and <a href="../../../i/m/f/IMF_5a61.html" title="IMF">IMF</a> who have warned about the Danish real estate market being in a bubble state (btw, history shows that the real estate industry often try to deny/downplay crashes, so it's not paranoia not to trust them.). As for the Nationalbank, it actually said "some areas" might be exceptions and honestly I don't even consider Nationalbanken as completely neutral, as it has an interest in</dd>

<p>ensuring stability of the economy so they clearly prefer "soft landings". Anyway, I agree the article needs citations (which I already said I would do in the weekend) but currently it has been put up for deletion for another reason (incidentally(?), by a friend of yours) because "Wikipedia is not a crystal ball". What about <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_housing_bubble_6566.html" title="United States housing bubble">United States housing bubble</a> - are you going to delete that as well as all the other "bubble"-articles? The same reasoning applies to that article. Para82 21:04, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
