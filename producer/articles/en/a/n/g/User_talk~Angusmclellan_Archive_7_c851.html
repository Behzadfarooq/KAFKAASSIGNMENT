Now you tell me why you deleted mine and give me a very good reson or i will tell every one i know to BAN WIKI! and do what i can to contest then legaly! and i found you have a list of 2006 video games a outrage as to my page being deleted and not theres you tell me why my page can't be here but you alow a page for each game made lol or is it cause you get bribed to keep them on<small>âThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Alex dergian (<a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlex_dergian_b126.html" title="User talk:Alex dergian">talk</a> â¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Alex_dergian_a87c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Alex dergian">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>as i said bribed well i don't care if you disalow me editing no will not do any thing with legal matters i did know you had that page but i will no long use this encyclopedia as the things you said just seemed like you can't talk about your self even thoght you do on your user page very much so having links to other projects you do and im sure other wiki person do the same so yeah you do advertise lol just have to let some one else do it for you or be aprart of wiki seem all to corrupt don't both talking to my acount infact delete it i really don't like wiki but as for the ip i am at work so there is no need to do a ip ban and if you did that would just be another show of how corrupt this encyclopidea is</p>

<p>The edit warring seems to have started on the 29th and has involved many editors. I don't really want to wait until this becomes too serious before taking action. I hope everyone will discuss on the talk page, so they can at least agree on what should be in the article. <b><a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="background:#009;color:#7FFF00">Nish</span><span style="background:cyan;color:#009">kid</span></a><a href="../../../n/i/s/User_talk%7ENishkid64_b4d4.html" title="User talk:Nishkid64"><span style="background:orange;color:navy blue">64</span></a></b> 22:24, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I still think that it's to be deeply deprecated and discouraged.

<dd>I couldn't agree more â but that's a matter of the application of the policy, not the nature of the policy. The same thing could be said of most Wikipedia policies: overeager or confrontational editors (including admins) can apply them inappropriately and in ways that exacerbate problems â and I'm on record concerning my opinion of <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a>.

<p>Mostly because so far I've not run into a situation where I <i>really</i> felt I needed the mop and bucket... In the case of the diff you showed, I was able to just post on their pages (though we'll see how effective that actually was since one party isn't around from the looks of it and the other is off asking <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo_Wales_1525.html" title="Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> if it is OK for him to remove content from his talk page). So far pretty much everything I've needed to do I've been able to with just editor privleges. I will say though that when I visited <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_ea9e.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets">Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets</a> a few days back and saw the backlog it was the first time I saw something that I could probably help with more if I had the tools than without, and that at least got me thinking about it.<br />

<p>Agreed, not a good idea. However, rather than redirect a Genus to a species I think it is better to point to the page where the Genus &amp; species are, for the user to select the one he wants.

<p>Dear Angus, Thanks v much for your kind remarks. I haven't quite finished with Beonna yet (only started on that a couple of nights ago). I agree most prefer Beonna (and I do) but the forms on coins and in texts vary: this was what I found based on the 'East Anglian Monarchs' category already existing and rather than fiddle (as I am a wiki novice rather) I thought I'd just fill in some articles and leave the outward form for consideration afterwards. I've been leaving any possible revision of the more famous guys (Raedwald, Aethelberht II, Eadmund) for consideration when I've filled in the rest, which should include minor notices for all the others not yet done between Wuffa and Edmund. Hope noone objects to that. Obviously Raedwald needs beefing up to his full stature and that will take careful thought... Meanwhile these tricky fellows in between! Thanks for whatever you're doing. I'll need to beg that reference on the B dynasty from you as I've mislaid it and can only quote J Campbell citing it.

<p>Hi Angus, I have just been cleaning up succession boxes on the East Anglian articles and realise (looking at the Monarchs page) that we have been crossing over in edits with different effects! I don't know if you would like to discuss this here or on another page, but it would be as well if we agreed before I go any further. I think we need to discuss several points in the succession dates etc. Points I'd like us to agree about: 1. The annalistic tradition that mentions Wuffa says that he is ruling in 571, not that he acceeds in that year - he should be ante 571. Comment? 2. On the annals basis, Tyttla should be 578-599, not 593, because although there is a Raedwald death annal for 599 there is a duplicate for 624 (probably about right) and so 599 was probably a scribal error for the Tyttla dies/Raedwald acceeeds annal. Comment? 3. Why is Raedwald put at 593 and not 599 as in the annal date? Do you have another source? 4. Why does Raedwald not continue to be king of East Anglia until 624 (the annal date?) Presumably the fact that he gained seniority in c616 or 617 didn't stop him ruling in East Anglia, any more than it stopped Ethelbert being King of Kent or Edwin King of Northumbria? Ive never heard anyone suggest otherwise (but might have missed some recent argument). 5. What evidence, if any, is there that Eni was ever a king of East Anglia? and particularly for his dates? So far as I can see, Eorpwald is Raedwald's heir (hence Sigebert's exile) and succeeds him? I can't see any justification for putting Eni anywhere except as a possible associate king of either Raedwald or Eorpwald, and I doubt if he is ruling during the 'Ricberht' phase because Anna his son is already married and Christian by c630 and Ethilric his (?eldest) son (in the Anglian pedigree) has a Christian marriage about this time. That suggests Eni's family is well-disposed to Christianity and makes unneccessary Bede's implication that Sigebert's recall involved a military conquest. So far as I know this is fairly orthodox thinking, but perhaps I have missed something recent again? 6. I aim to put Hun, Beonna and Alberht all together in one box, with three separate articles - okay with you? 7. Also running into problems in the 770s-780s. The proto-article on Aethelred puts him in the mid780s on numismatic evidence (none that I know of, except that if he is father of St Ethelbert (as in the <i>Life</i>) that is about right, and the evidence is Ethelbert's coin), but the Monarchs page ends him decisively in 779. Comment? The trouble is, I don't know if the original stubs were based on recent publication or coin finds which I haven't seen yet, or on very ancient encyclopoedias deriving from Victorian confident inference! If the former, I defer: if the latter, it should reflect modern scholarship instead. Perhaps your Keynes/Lapidge volume can help? Sorry this is long, but hope you can help me thrash it out. Thanks! <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalgamanus_f0f6.html" title="User:Walgamanus">Walgamanus</a> may also be interested: Ill post him to this site. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Steven_Plunkett_cb74.html" title="User:Dr Steven Plunkett">Dr Steven Plunkett</a> 19:31, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
The source of the articles is unclear. Of those which don't say, some are certainly based on the Early British Kingdoms website of David Ford Nash, some may be based on the 1911 Britannica, and others might use the Kessler website. I would recommend that you are ruthless in suppressing anything that seems implausible. I cleaned up early medieval and high medieval Scottish rulers, and retained almost none of the pre-existing material. The list of monarchs needs redoing. I can do the list. I've created a template which I think has the rulers in the right order, although I'm not very sure about Offa. Feel free to criticise:</p>

<p>Regarding the specific questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Wuffa: king from 571 according to Roger of Wendover (Yorke, p. 61)</li>
<li>Tytla: king from 578 according to Roger of Wendover (Yorke, p. 61); a scribal error seems a plausible explanation for the s.a. 599 entry.</li>
<li>None of my sources give an accession date for Raedwald more specific than x616 that I can see.</li>
<li>Yorke has Raedwald die x627, Kirby says before 624 is possible, Keynes gives the range 616x627 (hedging his bets).</li>
<li>I know of no evidence that Eni was king and your explanation seems eminently orthodox to me.</li>
<li>I'm all for combining things to make decent-sized articles!</li>
<li>For the period after Ãlfwald, confusion seems the word. Saint Ãthelberht's father supposedly royal father is shown as Ãthelred? on the template. The list by Simon Keynes in the <i>Blackwell Encyclopedia</i> does not include him; Barbara Yorke (<i>Kings and Kingdoms</i>, p. 67, table 6) does, following Beorna (but doesn't list Ãthelberht I, Hun or Alberht); Kirby (<i>Earliest English Kings</i>, p. 134) thinks that Beorna was followed by <u>Saint Ãthelberht</u>, who would thus have ruled from 779 to 794.

<p>Thanks so much for this very helpful response, which makes me feel more confident as it is more or less as I have it in Suffolk in Anglo-Saxon Times. I can now press on and be damned for it... In the latin, Wuffa is already in post by 571, so he should be ante 571-578. Tyttla 578-599. Although the annalist-copyist never mentioned Raedwald's accession, he obviously had a sleepy day when he copied out the same thing twice for Raedwald's death, but he had a 599 annal in his source which he never copied out the proper text for. That, I take it, was the end of Tyttla and the beginning of Raedwald. R has to be there well before 616 to be building up his power in Ethelbert's lifetime and getting baptized, sheltering Edwin etc. - and being strong enough to face up to Ethelfrith. I shall put him down for&#160;?599-624, and becoming 'Bretwalda' in 616-7. Really Eni shouldn't be in this list, but I suppose he can be listed as a&#160;?sub-king so people can find him,&#160;? active under R's supremacy. I've done some of this fiddling on the succession boxes. Incidentally the copyist went wrong again later and slipped all the annals for Sigebert etc, out by one event in the series: he still kept the right dates but put the wrong events next to them. I expect he was reading from one of those much-copied texts where the year is not directly opposite the annal entry. Should we really be using the term 'bretwalda???' It used to be frowned upon as term of Anglo-Saxon revisionism to evoke the idea of a crown of Britain. But leaving that aside, (as it will affect everyone else), as to the later period, the Oswald of East Anglia coin mentioned in the Aethelred stub is a <i>mistake</i>, because there <i>was</i> an O of EA in coins, but he is after Eadmund, a sub-Guthrum ruler in the <b>8</b>70s (not the 770s). He needs to go out here. So the stubs are full of stuff that just needs clearing out and start again. That's fine. Thanks Very Much, cheers. Hope you like the rest when it comes and let's reconsider everything when some more is done. Why not leave the Monarchs list till last and amend it at the end? <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Steven_Plunkett_cb74.html" title="User:Dr Steven Plunkett">Dr Steven Plunkett</a> 02:01, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Angus, looking at the Penda article (preparing for Aethelhere) it says at note 52 (in text) that Bede says Penda was decapitated. I can't find this, can you? In HE iii.24 he is interemtus or interfectus, but not obtruncatus or decapitatus. Do you know if it is elsewhere in Bede? <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Steven_Plunkett_cb74.html" title="User:Dr Steven Plunkett">Dr Steven Plunkett</a> 05:21, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>please, please stop creating these {{lang-ISO3}} templates. It is insane to create separate templates for the 5,000 or so languages in ISO. It is perfectly sufficient, and much cleaner to just use {{<a href="../../../l/a/n/Template%7ELangWithName_4339.html" title="Template:LangWithName">langWithName</a>}} directly. What you are doing is creating a crapload of templates that do nothing else but transclude another template. Which is a bad idea already for concerns of server load. I would even recommend scrapping that too, and spell out the langauge link in the text, as in</p>

<dd>why, thank you (I expected a "volley of argument" so to speak, hence my somewhat polemical approach, sorry) -- I think it will be enough to deprecate them, as I did on {{<a href="../../../l/a/n/Template%7ELang-de_4c75.html" title="Template:Lang-de">lang-de</a>}} already; if the deprecation doesn't raise too many eyebrows, we can always send a bot after them for replacement later. regards, <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(ð³)</a></small> 10:47, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Umm, that's where I have already looked, but I don't see much of a discussion there, let alone a consensus for the templates to be deprecated. All I see is Dbachmann's proposal to get rid of the lang-ISO1 templates with no feedback. If that's the only place where this issue was been raised, I suggest reverting the deprecation notices that have been placed in the {{lang-xx}} templates so far and waiting until a consensus is reached. Deprecating templates before anyone had a chance to say anything seems just... wrong.

<dd>Feel free to revert the changes. I do not feel strongly about the matter, apart from the certainty that creating many of the tagged templates was an error on my part and that the alternatives were deprecation or deletion ({{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-author_8ff7.html" title="Template:Db-author">db-author</a>}} says "created in error" which they were). There's no danger of an edit war. I spend many of my working hours arguing about (and usually against) the re-invention of the wheel, and the creation of unnecessary custom solutions to problems, so I really do not want to do things like that on Wikipedia.

<p>Hello Angus, sorry to keep bothering you, but... The problem with that AEthelred of East Anglia page was that it was for the guy in the 870s who just has coins, after Edmund and before Guthrum: and Not for the legendary father of AEthelberht KM, who fl 760s-80s if not merely mythic. So I have moved the existing page (stub) for Aethelred of East Anglia to a new title Aethelred II of East Anglia, and am about to create a new one for AEthelred I of East Anglia for my 8th century geezer. Unfortunately when I check this (AEthelred II) for links etc it comes up with your template and a long list of dates in the 770s etc, which are to the wrong page. here doesn't seem to have been a page for the first AEthelred. Sorry about this, not quite sure how one fixes it. But I'll go ahead and make my page for AE I now. Thought Id better let you know.

<ul>
<li>Thanks for that. Ive sorted them I think. Could you help a little more with the template? I think I want to express that Offa is overlord (but not exactly Bretwalda) in East Anglia through the 760s until 796, and similarly for Coenwulf, Ceolwulf and Beornwulf, parallel with the reigns of Aethelred I, Aethelbert II, Eadwald and AEthelstan (who should commence c 821). Is there some way of doing this in the boxes at the foot of the articles? Could you set up an example for Offa, for instance, through the reign of AEthelred I, and then I can copy and adapt for the others? I get the impression that you are the man for templates!

In fact this paper originally appeared in Sally M Foster, Ed., The St Andrews Sarcophagus - A Pictish Masterpiece and its International Connections (Four Courts Press, Dublin 1998) <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1 85182 414 6</a> (hbk) (or 4, pbk), 97-167. I remember because she spoke at the conference for a long time, and it was very illuminating. Possibly that ref is worth citing? I suggest rather than wading in and doing it myself as the article seems to be largely yours and I don't wish to tamper unnecessarily!

<p>I just received your welcome. I've been overloading my senses at Wiki since I found it these past two months and have only gotten brave enough to correct typos. I look at your credentials and mine are simply 50 years reading encyclopedias and dictionaries like they were novels. I admit a favoring for the flavor of history but that takes me to many other spheres. I worked at the UIUC when Netscape was still Mosaic and HTML had about 30 commands. I've been on hiatus and out of the loop since 2003 but I'm looking forward to sharpening my skills in the sandbox. So you are my go to guy? I would like to spend some time working with the deletion project if it would be helpful. But I could not figure out how to add myself to the list. Can you help me? Will I be notified of new additions or do I check back periodically? Thanks for making yourself available to us new folk. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarlabrownfeld_9c83.html" title="User:Marlabrownfeld">MarlaB</a> 08:37, 21 January 2007 (UTC)MarlaB</p>

<p>Angus, the contribution was not precisely *scanned* -- the source is simply my Master's Thesis. I edited it down, attempting to turn it into a readable form. I included endnotes and a bibliography. It is, essentially, all of the information I managed to track down on the subject of king David I during about six months studying him. I have since moved on to other subjects, and have little use for a paper on the subject. It is not technically copyrighted, and should be in the public domain. I hope it will be useful; feel free to do with it what you wish.&#160;:o) SlowwwwMoses 19:02, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm very glad it will be of some use. Sorry about the length -- you'll be happy to know that I edited roughly half of the paper out already. (I suspect if I had simply posted the entire thing, you wouldn't be nearly as understanding.) It is true that the historiographical section is still a bit long -- it was also the most time consuming to produce, as you might imagine -- but as you say, there is material in there that might easily be shifted around, especially the background material on Malcolm Canmore, Saint Margaret, Alexander I and Edgar I.</p>
<p>Oh, and don't worry about the questions! I'm only too aware of the problem of plagiarism and copyright infringement; my students are prime offenders, (the little bastards). Wikipedia must face those problems, and vandalism, in order to earn a reputation as a trustworthy source. Just look at what happened to the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Cannae_3437.html" title="Battle of Cannae">Battle of Cannae</a>, today. The <i>Battle of the Gay Poopers</i>, indeed. Ugh.

<p>I believe the traditional view is that the Halfdan you're talking about, the Halfdan of the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Heathen_Army_47c2.html" title="Great Heathen Army">Great Heathen Army</a> was the son of <a href="../../../r/a/g/Ragnar_Lodbrok_40a1.html" title="Ragnar Lodbrok">Ragnar Lodbrok</a> though of course that's controversial. I've seen him also conflated with <a href="../../../h/v/i/Hvitserk.html" title="Hvitserk">Hvitserk</a> but I'm not sure if there is any textual justification for this; they seem to have led quite different lives. Guthred seems to be a very mysterious figure and beyond his formerly slave status, I don't know much about him. Have you read Bernard Cornwell's <i>Lords of the North</i>? He is a major character. I think the book "Viking Empires" which is cited in <a href="../../../o/l/a/Olaf_the_White_4469.html" title="Olaf the White">Olaf the White</a> has some good discussion of the Kingdom of Jorvik generally. I'll take a look and see what I can find.

<p>I haven't looked yet as I'm a bit tied up with Sutton Hoo, but wasn't he the one who went off with Edgar's intended bride? She sold Stoke (the over-river half of Ipswich) to Bishop AEthelwold when he was re-endowing Ely in 970, and as Stoke has high ground and a clear view down the Orwell, a dedication to Augustine, and is next to Bourne (Cyril Hart's preference for Burna, St Edmund's place of consecration in 855), we like to infer (!) that she got it from Aethelstan and he had it as a royal estate inheritance: so, possibly a dwelling for him next door to the big harbour.

<p>I'd welcome your comments at the above FAC. I thought it would be a walk-in, but the unexpected lodging of a request for mediation in the middle of the FAC process seems to have caused some people to "object", though I see no offence to the criteria on that account (by all means respond that way yourself, by the way; this isn't canvassing but a request for informed opinion on the actual article). What I long for is someone who knows about history to give a response to the article itself. I know this is only a personal consideration, but I have buried myself in the subject for the past several weeks and might not be able to respond in so well-primed a way in a future FAC. It's not anyone else's concern, but I'm really up for this at the moment and would like to get the FAC out of the way, leaving people to discuss the title in the future, as they probably will do forever. (My view on the title is that even a group of Medieval historians wouldn't presume to mediate a definitive title for this king, so any Wikipedian who volunteers to do so is certainly brave: this king has never had a definitive name, as the article and the books on him show. I'm thinking of writing a book on him myself in the medieval kings "Choose Your Own Title" series.) <a href="../../../q/p/1/User%7EQp10qp_d299.html" title="User:Qp10qp">qp10qp</a> 14:27, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for your note and for visiting my talk. Good to see your interests- For a while I specialized in the Archeology of Britain (I started in London in the 60s with the Guildhall Museum). I went to Durham University-studying there Anthropology, Archeology and History. I settled out specialist in things Celtic due to my re-location to Munich and its proximity to early sites. Then on return to to the USA I found the best use of my skills to be in teaching and writing about Irish Studies- specializing in the Earlier Periods but becoming a generalist- that means mastering the messy politics... etc.....I took a detour into politics to prepare for teaching but have been in the relativly fresh air for a good while now having gotten my education and failing to convince politicians to embrace culture! I tend now to be more interested in celebrations, food ways, folk music and customs.</p>
<p>I have specialized in St. Brigid of Kildare primairly because I saw a need to gather all of the ancient or at least the older sources and make them availiable to those who were interested in the baseline information. It seems the world is awash in "new revelation" which is the best way I can describe it, so perhaps my work has a utility. No problem with "new revelation" if it is properly souced. I notice that there are indeed two Brigid pages which seems good. Saints lives are interesting in that they can be many things. The Brigid page (christian) needs a bit of work-repeats itself a bit- and there is some information which is not there. Association with plants....status of relics....and a few more bits. Some day I will see what I can add from my book. Trouble is - space limitations but there are some short things which might flesh out the article just a bit.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is a bit overwealming at first. I find much of the heavy process and beurocracy discouraging. But, if there is time I will see what I can contribute.Cbladey 19:36, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm currently planning on finishing the David I article. I see someone beat me to it. Not sure what to do now. The added text is very significant, but not that much of it seems to be written in a style appropriate to a wiki article. Virtually all of the "Political Context â Malcolm, Margaret and the âotherâ Canmore kings" looks discardable, for instance. I think some can be saved with some editing ... it certainly helps the historiography and personality sections. Do you think I should still proceed as planned? <b><a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalgacus_587c.html" title="User:Calgacus">Calgacus</a> (<i><a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalgacus_321f.html" title="User talk:Calgacus">ÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎ£</a></i>)</b> 22:09, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What should I do? I guess I can look to see what I can incorporate or something. The style is not very encyclopaedic ... and ignoring some factual inaccuracies (such as a confusion of CausantÃ­n, Earl of Fife as a ruler of Moray), the historiographic section is fun to read and interesting at times.

<dd>The author is an intelligent chappie ... some nice observations. I was planning on doing a similar thing with my dissertation on Cranes and Pygmies (which got a good first), but like this article, it reads like a paper rather than an encyclopedia article. Anything salvaged ... and it'd be a shame not to salvage lots of it ... has to be edited heavily in order to make it encyclopaedic and self-containing. Also, moving lots of it would rob the contributor of the credit. Any thoughts on that? Ignoring that, when I finish, we can start salvaging it. For instance, I'm gonna have to create sub-articles to get my article down to size - e.g. early life, davidian revolution. Other sub-articles could be create from this chappy's contribution ... such as Personality of David I. We could have a template on the bottom like on the <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> article or the <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_2730.html" title="George Washington">George Washington</a> article.

<dd>There are two major sections which need to be salvaged, the Margaret bit and the Historiography of the reign of David I part. The latter is most of the good part of the essay. I'm thinking that when I'm finished we should moved the <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_I_of_Scotland_9be5.html" title="David I of Scotland">David I of Scotland</a> article to Historiography of David I, King of Scots, paste my preprepared article on the redirect, and edit the new historiography article to be both encyclopaedic and including only the historiography, finding new homes for the rest as we wish.

<p>Ah, I see. Thank you. I do grow a bit suspicious of any sentence which contains the words "widely regarded" while it does not cite its sources, hence my edits of late. <a href="../../../d/i/e/User%7EDieOfGoodLuck_b0bd.html" title="User:DieOfGoodLuck">DieOfGoodLuck</a> 13:43, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for your message, Angus. I was pleased to know that it wasn't just me who found it all rather bizarre. It's rather unfortunate that people nominate candidates who have no real hope of passing because it inevitably leads to bad feelings. I understand wanting to nominate people you like but it's just not fair to lead inexperienced people to believe they have a shot at RfA when anyone who hangs around RfA these days would know that someone with less than 400 edits has no chance.

<dd>Hello Angus, and thanks for the thoughtful (as always) reply. I did'nt think of the copyright issue! Thanks for bringing it up. I'll continue, but will keep this in mind, and hopefully should trim it in time. As for the infinite ban idea, it arouse out of an ever growning anger at the number of Wikipedians driven off the project by both trolls and abusers. A way of blowing steam, to be sure, but a serious issue nonetheless.

<p>Any thoughts on what should be cut from the David article? It's tough ... the notes and bibliography take up over 30kbs, meaning that any cuts taking the whole thing below 80 would severely alter the article. And it's a hard thing to destroy one's own work.

<p>Thanks for you help. I'm gonna have to cut some of the text and divide many paragraphs, even though I really don't want to. Undoubtedly this will produce more typos and I'll have to do more work. Such is the FAC process. But the way it works is that FAC is the only way to be assured decent peer review and outsider perspective, and so is a necessary evil. BTW, I just sent you that material because I <i>thought</i> you were working on getting Flann Sinna to FA, but you should feel free to do whatever you want. Like I said, if you need anything from that source for any other figures, just ask. Oh, do you have designs on the St Patrick article? I'll send you the relevant article just in case.

<p>I believe that the EU warrants for arrest of 25 CIA agents is a stunning event. These warrants are lawful and may be applied in all EU states. This is a novel legal trend and I think it should be followed. I think that it should be archived. This is the beginning of a long process. I believe these names are probably aliases, but in any event this hasn't been reported in the mainstream press. I would like to leave the article on wiki for a month and improve it with other articles. If the arrest warrants are withdrawn then I would be happy to delete this article. <small>âThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThething88_4f52.html" title="User:Thething88">Thething88</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThething88_1154.html" title="User talk:Thething88">talk</a> â¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Thething88_1049.html" title="Special:Contributions/Thething88">contribs</a>) 19:25, 17 February 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>Rodel Itulrade Fair enough, your points were all valid. I simply thought that Itulrade is likely to feature heavily on the 12th book of the series, and thus readers curious about what is known could look it up on wikipedia rather than having to go through the entire wheel of time series themselves.-<a href="../../../d/e/z/User%7EDezza91_daaa.html" title="User:Dezza91">User:Dezza91</a></p>

<p>Hello Angus, I'm a bit of a "noobie" here so ... I attempted to add a stub regarding folk musician Andy Ramage who was influencial from late 60s through current times (Bitter Wythie, Harness, Glenfarg Folk Club). Your return comment indicated that I did not meet guidelines. I've contributed serveral things over the last couple of years without wading through guidelines and this is the first "push back" I received. I skimmed the guidelines in this case. Most are clear and reasonable but do not seem to be relevant to this case so any detailed feedback would be helpfull.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance. <small>âThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Wundermac (<a href="../../../w/u/n/User_talk%7EWundermac_2b51.html" title="User talk:Wundermac">talk</a> â¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wundermac_5e40.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wundermac">contribs</a>) 11:09, 20 February 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
<p>Hello Angus,</p>
<p>I hope I'm using this system correctly (note that my post in your discussion is marked as "unsigned" - take this as unfamiliarity rather than disrespect:-)</p>
<p>Thanks for the detailed response. Between my question and your response, I read through the music notability discussion and frankly it's a bit of a "bourach". The most obvious criticism is that the attempted guidelines seem to be well suited for mainstream recording and commercial work but not for less-commercial areas of musical activity.</p>
<p>My early understanding of Wikipedia was that it would not suffer the problems of conventional sources (e.g. exclusion of "less important" topics due to lack of space - as in a book) since it was digital and bits are cheap and available in vast quantity.</p>
<p>I have to think that if we applied this sort of thing to geography, only "important" and "notable" places would be recorded and written about. I would think that an on-lin resource would want to be as inclusive as possible in order to be something more than older-style references. Instead, we seem to be getting the same social engineering that occurs when something becomes sucessful - the creation of a priesthood who control the resource. In general terms, these development are similar to those seen in the commercial music scene - payola, play lists, pr/journo flacks etc.</p>
<p>Ah well - I'll leave the rant and go back to the drawing board on Ramage. I have a couple of reference books on Scottish music where I think he is mentioned. Perhaps I can also add a couple of recording references and his influence in developing club and festival activity in central Scotland.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>Hi there! You added a 'proposed deletion' template to the <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beauty_is_the_Beast_494e.html" title="Beauty is the Beast">Beauty is the Beast</a> article (stub). I removed it, my reasons are on the talk page.

<dd>The closings looked fine. Except non-admins can't do all the work that is required in a rename result, since the original category needs to be deleted once the new one is created and the members are transferred over. just tag it for speedy delete when you are done transferring members and that should be fine. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 21:11, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

There are other reasons to keep these, some of which <a href="../../../v/j/d/User%7EVJDocherty_0805.html" title="User:VJDocherty">VJDocherty</a> articulated and would suggest, like he did, that "no consensus" would have been a better result at this time. <a href="../../../s/h/s/User%7EShsilver_5f57.html" title="User:Shsilver">Shsilver</a> 15:10, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The administrator has come to an incorrect conclusion on this issue. Five votes to "Delete" and six votes to "Keep" is <b>not</b> a consensus to Delete.

<p>XfD closes are only glossed in exceptionally. I don't believe this was sufficiently exceptional to require any glossing.

<dd>Your comments on <a href="../../../v/j/d/User%7EVJDocherty_0805.html" title="User:VJDocherty">VJDocherty</a>'s talk page (which I should not have to track down) have it backwards. No one in the discussion referred to "overcategorization", the opponents of the category mostly just seemed to think it wasn't a significant honor, which is not the case. I have supported deleting categories in many discussions and I have cleaned up categories on hundreds of author pages to reduce overcategorization, so I know what this problem looks like, and this category isn't the problem. We can dig around and find other administrators to try to fix it, but you made the mistake, you should take responsibility for fixing it. <a href="../../../a/v/t/User%7EAvt_tor_cbb9.html" title="User:Avt tor">Avt tor</a> 17:06, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Saying that being a Guest of Honor is "not a significant honour" certainly is an argument from overcategorization. It may be significant to fandom, but that seems a rather poor form of argument. Everything is important to some group of people. I'll happily put things back the way they were if someone overturns the close.

<dd>No, it isn't.

<dd>It looks at DRV like you consented to undo your CFD close because you aren't an admin. I'd do it as an admin, and close the DRV, but I haven't been at CFD enough to fix the tag.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>You're entitled to your opinion, but I do think there is one way in which you are being glaringly unfair. <i>Long</i> before I was ever an admin, way back in Oct. 2005, I had already made clear that my standards at RfA were very conservative/very high. So they always been, and if you'll take a closer look at my own RfA, you'll see several supporters noticed my toughness even there. Think whatever you wish about my exchange with Mr. Lawton (indeed, Mr. Snow and I have come to a friendly understanding, so I feel happy about it), but I am quite firm in my view that my standards for&#160;!voting in RfA have not moved an inch from the hard line I took up long ago. I'm stodgy, but consistent. My tough standard is enforced on myself by my offer to be recalled, which stands.
