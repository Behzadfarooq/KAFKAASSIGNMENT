<dd>Hi, thanks for your help! I learned how to use the Post a comment feature and I got an account. It asked for email but I don't really use it much because I have ICQ so I left it blank. Is this ok? I have many questions and I hope you can help me. how I can put my name on screen after my message and where I can chat and make friends. Do you have ICQ?

<p>Hi Angela. I've recently been made a sysop, and I figured that I'd take my questions about it to the altar of the WikiGodess herself. First of all, about deletions - can a sysop just make a speedy deletion of a junk page without telling anyone? Second of all, the "Deletion of personal pages" under the "Speedy deletion page" - should a sysop just go and delete all of those? And finally, what's the real difference between a deletion and just editing a page and taking out all the text? Oh, and also, is there a standard cut-and-paste message for greeting newcomers? Thanks, <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_S_5f20.html" title="User:Alex S">Alex S</a> 15:51, 28 Mar 2004 (UTC).</p>
<dl>
<dd>Allow me to butt in...&#160;;D There is no standard greeting that I am aware of; I just swipe the one from <a href="../../../i/l/y/User%7EIlyanep_Welcome_Message_a70e.html" title="User:Ilyanep/Welcome Message">User:Ilyanep/Welcome Message</a> and edit the name. <a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFennec_d10b.html" title="User:Fennec">Fennec</a> 15:53, 28 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks Fennec and Angela for your answers. One more question. When is it appropriate to block a user? Is there a definitive blocking policy? Case in point is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=204.63.177.3" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=204.63.177.3" rel="nofollow">204.63.177.3</a>. I've rolledback several of his vandalisms (which is all s/he posts). Where do I go to suggest a ban/block/whatever the terminology is? <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_S_5f20.html" title="User:Alex S">Alex S</a></dd>

<p>Feel free to check it if you like, its at the top of my talk page. I get so much mail I have to archive regularly. And no, no one has responded other than you. I think the request for mediation is a bad idea, but it was really the only thing I could think of in order to get some assistance and be compatable with policy, w/o trying to push a quickpoll (which I think may be the real soloution). He has exceeded the 3 revert policy after having been warned <a href="../../../f/a/s/Talk%7EFascism_59c2.html" title="Talk:Fascism">talk:fascism</a>, w warning on his talk, now deleted (he deletes everything I put on his talk page w no response other than 'troll' in the edit summary), been unwilling to accept consesnsus regarding his <a href="../../../f/a/s/Talk%7EFascism_suggested_readings_1fd9.html" title="Talk:Fascism/suggested readings">Talk:Fascism/suggested readings</a>, has been abusive both in talk and in edit summaries, and has generally been a horrorshow to deal w. On <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_172_83ce.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/172">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/172</a> there is evidence that this is nothing new, and apparently is his standard. I wouldn't know, my only previous experience w him prior to this was pleasent, agreeing w him about a page he nominated as brilliant prose, and mildly asking him to tone it down when he insulted someones reading abilities, etc.. when they objected to a different article he had listed there. Anyhow the problem is big, mediation w me alone will not help much of anything, and I am mainly looking for advice. Sorry if I went about it the wrong way.

<p>re: "There is no such rule that each request must be made independantly, so this is a perfectly valid listing. and the talk page suggests that there are problems with the references you have cited. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 02:06, Mar 29, 2004 (UTC)"</p>
<p>The point is not that there is a rule per-se, just as the point to any given rule is not that there is a rule. The point is that the person who posted the request intentionally used non-debate strategy to achieve a goal that by any rational code of ethics should be purely a matter of debate.</p>
<p>Secondly, the talk page cannot suggest. It is an inaminate object. Someone suggested, a single person. You are a single person too. Perhaps you could have checked the references and formed your own opinion, instead of being an unwitting <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sock_puppet.html" title="Sock puppet">sock puppet</a>. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_baas_eec8.html" title="User:Kevin baas">Kevin Baas</a> 19:42, 29 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I wasn't voting, so there was no need for me to check the references. I was just pointing out the facts to assist the person who would be making the deletion decision. I do not appreciate you making personal attacks on me just because you're annoyed your pages got deleted. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 22:29, Mar 29, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am sorry if I appear to be making a personal attack. I am stating critical flaws in what you have said and done, and suggesting another courses of action to take in the future.</p>
<p>The facts had already been stated. Everything you said was redundant. Therefore your statement, since it does not present any new information, can only be construed as taking a side, and it was. That's what you communicated. That's what everybody heard.</p>
<p>You were influencing people's decision. Whether or not you voted is quite irrelevant. Voting is just one way to influence a decision, and the mere act of voting is of no importance. When one is concerned with voting, they are concerned with a decision being influenced. This same concern applies to what you said. In sum, metaphorically speaking, you did vote. (In fact, the administrator who deleted the pages said that there were five votes for deletion, which means that he/she construed your influence as a vote.)</p>
<p>The point is that, as you do not deny but in fact have affirmed, you influenced a decision without being aware of the circumstances. That is unethical. It is also against the deletion policy as stated on the wikipedia votes for deletion subpages.</p>
<p>You have chosen to go along with someone else's opinion and decry something that you have said that you know nothing about, and had chosen to know nothing about. Now you no longer have either of these choices. This is the natural consequence of this type of behavior. Whether it is good or bad? In any case, it is certainly dangerous. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_baas_eec8.html" title="User:Kevin baas">Kevin Baas</a> 23:06, 29 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There were 5 votes to delete without my comment being taken into account; Wile E. Heresiarch, Friedo, Hankwang, Denni and Taku all said delete. I expressed no opinion on this matter; I simply felt it was important to point out that the claims you were making were not true or not consistent with the talk page. I fail to see how you can take this to be a violation of any policies. For example, you said "due process of request for deletion of a page requires that each request be made independently". This is not the case, so I pointed this out in case a new sysop read this as a true statement and thought they could not delete it based on such a comment. You also said "author has submitted references", and I pointed out that the validity of these had been disputed. I did not say <i>I</i> disputed them. I just felt this information should not be left out in case the person deleting did not check the talk page and took this statement to be a reason that the pages should not be deleted. There is nothing wrong with someone noting that additional information is available on a talk page. Your objection to me doing this suggests you have something to hide and did not want people reading the talk page. I suggest you get over the fact these have been deleted and stop attacking anyone who may have been involved with it. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 23:34, Mar 29, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>By due process i mean that process which is intrinsicly deserved by a page. I was not refering to any written code.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Wile had already pointed out that he disputes the validity of the references, in his request. Noone else has disputed them, and no one has disputed that he disputed them. Your statement regarding this, therefore, was redundant.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Also, Wile already pointed to the talk pages, saying that more information was available there, again, in his request. So this statement, too, was redundant.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You did not say that any of the claims I was making were not true.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Furthermore, a request is not a vote. Congress does not submit a bill to the house and in that house claim a vote. Wile made a request. The dispute is whether that request is accepted, not whether or not he made the request.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Furthermore, the administrator who deleted the page notated that the keep vote was from the author of the page. The administator noting this communicates that she feels this fact to be significant. If this fact is significant, than the fact that the requestor votes for deletion is equally significant. If one is to be discounted on this association alone, they both are. (The whole reason for being of voting is that the creator and the requestor are a priori considered equally credible.) The administrator discounted the keep vote on this association alone, and therefore the requestor's request is not considered a vote and the requestor cannot vote. Therefore, either there are four votes not including yours, or there was injustice.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I am not attacking. I am simply stating what has transpired.</li>

<p>Dear Angie: Once again thanks for the advice! It was very well received. Usually, so many people get blocked in one day that I dont like going through every single deletion to find my own number. I guess I'll just work on whatever I am allowed to work with!</p>
<p>Seems like someone has de-blocked me from some pages. If it was you, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. Meanwhile, Im still blocked from other pages, such as my desired <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_female_boxers.html" title="List of female boxers">List of female boxers</a>.</p>
<p>Desire for that page was born out of what I saw that <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_boxers.html" title="List of boxers">List of boxers</a> only included male boxers so I renamed it to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_male_boxers.html" title="List of male boxers">List of male boxers</a>, having in mind there are about 60 more or less known women boxers, including <a href="../../../l/a/i/Laila_Ali_4658.html" title="Laila Ali">Laila Ali</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christy_Martin_207d.html" title="Christy Martin">Christy Martin</a>. And looking how we have <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_actors.html" title="List of actors">List of actors</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_actresses.html" title="List of actresses">List of actresses</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_male_superheroes.html" title="List of male superheroes">List of male superheroes</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_female_superheroes.html" title="List of female superheroes">List of female superheroes</a>, and that the page on <a href="../../../w/o/m/Women%27s_boxing.html" title="Women's boxing">Women's boxing</a> has a partial list that makes the article look, ugh I harte to admit since I wrote it but..<i>ugly</i>....</p>
<p>Anyways, I just wanted to say , thanks and <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> bless you! My heart goes out to you!</p>

<dd>I didn't see the talk:RfA poll/discussion until after your message to me. I've now added my two cents (do the English say two pence?) there as well, but thank you for taking the time to personally solicit my opinion too. As a non-voting observer, I believe you read the consensus correctly for Fennec, so well done. And I wouldn't hold out much hope that bureaucratship or any other task here is purely mechanical implementation of the community consensus. The consensus is easily drowned in the noise, and everything we do involves making a judgement about that consensus.

<p><i>looks behind him ... "Wasn't I just on Meta?"...</i> I was wondering, since you are a sensible and kindly person, and much more suited to gentle chastisement of newbies than I am, if you could help me out. I have just noticed (and fixed) a problem on Meta where an anonymous user has destroyed Unicode characters in an article, presumably because their browser is incapable of doing otherwise (assuming they've set it up correctly obviously).

<dd>Well, let's assume good faith and pretend the user is honest in their motivations; in that case, the rule does not apply, because she doesn't want to state a point, she wants to have cybersex. Legal concerns notwithstanding, the argument about wikichess is legitimate. Nor would I agree with deleting the userpage because it is offensive, because we've kept quite a few offensive userpages around (e.g. <a href="../../../p/a/e/User%7EPaektu_c57c.html" title="User:Paektu">User:Paektu</a>).

<p>Hi Angela. Thank you for your kind words and sound advice on my Talk page. I want to assure you that I do not hold a grudge against you or anyone else who voted against me on the quickpoll. I've followed some of your work here (specifically, on VfD), and I respect and admire your good work and dedication to the project.</p>
<p>The last couple of weeks have been quite stressful for me. I spent a lot of time and energy on the Jerusaelm issue, and I feel that I have achieved very little. This obviously led to a feeling of frustration. Even before reading your message, I decided to take some time (perhaps a few days) to cool off, see how things develop with <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, and make a decision on whether I want to continue working on Wikipedia, or take a longer break. (I'm not fishing for "please don't leave" here. Really.) If I decide to stay (and perhaps even if not), I'll probably follow your advice and create a summary of my position on the "Jerusalem as capital" issue, which I can then direct people to. I do not want to spend the rest of my life (or even the rest of my time on Wikipedia) arguing this issue. There are many other areas here badly needing attention.</p>

<p>Hi Angela. Recently I've been contacting the several <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor.html" title="Doctor">doctors</a> on Wikipedia, and I'm trying to breathe some life into the medical <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_751e.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject">Wikiproject</a>.

<p>In regard to the above, I've got some questions that you might be able to answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do I arrange for those nice "blue boxes" at the bottom of a collection of pages? They're {{msg boilerplate implements, but I'm not sure who's got control over these messages.</li>
<li>Are you aware of any medically grounded sysops around Wikipedia?</li>
<li>Might there be a case for one of us (not me!!!) achieving adminship for this effort?</li>

<p>Hope you had a good Easter! Thank you many times for your answer regarding a main page; and I apologize, if posting to this page is not the proper format to ask a follow up question; but as a newbie, please feel free to point me in the right direction.</p>
<p>In short: you wrote:</p>
<p>"Wikisource has all languages on one site, so you don't need a developer to do anything.

"</p>
<p>My follow up (newbie) questions are:</p>
<p>"where" do I create a Farsi main page? "how" do I link it to the portal page?</p>
<p>Is there a HOWTO/FAQ/man page or the like?</p>

Now, alex is asking sysopship on wikisources, and to be able to make people sysop wikipedia wide. I suppose the first request will be fulfilled by someone, under the motive he is sysop on maori, meta and wikibooks now. In case he is made sysop/bureaucrat on fr by some weird process, I promise I will abuse my steward power, using as support the 100% rejection of french people toward his candidacy as a sysop.

<p>G'day Angela, how are things?</p>
<p>I'm finally having another go at the Transwiki system, but I'm afraid I didn't get very far. The good news is I was stopped before actually doing anything, so there's nothing to fix. The bad news is I can't find a transwiki log in the 9/11 memorial. What's more, I can't find one in <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transwiki" class="external text" title="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transwiki" rel="nofollow">French Wikipedia</a> either, although that's the URL given in the <a href="http://meta.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transwiki#Example" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transwiki#Example" rel="nofollow">this Meta page</a>.</p>

<p>Hi. I note your recent edit at <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stardust.html" title="Stardust">Stardust</a>. I've had a slight preference for having the titles of the disambiguated pages visibile. I was wondering if there was some policy about <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">Wikipedia:Disambiguation</a> I've missed that link names should be hidden on disambiguation pages? Or is this at present more a matter of personal preferences? Also, I'll add my voice to those admiring your new user page design.

<dl>
<dd>I think I can answer that. The text in both the article being disambiguated and the disambiguation article itself should be whatever makes the article's text flow smoothly. Sometimes hiding the full link name to keep it the same as before the disambiguation is best; sometimes expanding the name in the article clarifies the article anyway. Different people have different styles, some work better. If you think you can make the text better than it is, you should. <b>Be Bold.</b> Did I answer the right question? --<a href="../../../s/s/d/User%7ESsd_e9c6.html" title="User:Ssd">ssd</a> 06:14, 19 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello. I was wondering if I might ask for a little help from an admin. In an attempt to take care of many articles pointing to the "Plateau" disambiguation page (when the vast majority should go to Plateau (geology), I tried to move a few things around without realizing that what I wanted to do required that an article be overwritten. I moved <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plateau.html" title="Plateau">Plateau</a> to <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plateau_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Plateau (disambiguation)">Plateau (disambiguation)</a> and now I'd like <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plateau_%28geology%29.html" title="Plateau (geology)">Plateau (geology)</a> to go to <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plateau.html" title="Plateau">Plateau</a>. After this is done I'd be happy to go through all the <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_6633.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere">Whatlinkshere</a> pages to confirm that everything is pointing to the right place, but I'm not able to move <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plateau_%28geology%29.html" title="Plateau (geology)">Plateau (geology)</a> to <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plateau.html" title="Plateau">Plateau</a>. If you could either do this or move <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plateau_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Plateau (disambiguation)">Plateau (disambiguation)</a> back and let me know why I shouldn't have done that, I'd appreciate it.

<p>I know it's sort of quixotic, since it's pretty clear that these two don't want to mediate. My reasoning is something like this - 1) a request for arbitration would likely have been rejected by the committee, because it wants to see other dispute resolution methods tried, and 2) since they qualified for a quickpoll, I wanted to propose a different remedy rather than letting someone else propose a ban (and possibly see it applied inequitably). So I'm trying to be a little creative and at least have the request for mediation made, after a fashion. Having made that request, if it's up to me the next time I will be requesting arbitration. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 04:54, 20 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Angela, Mav - I think we have agreement that for RfC user conduct disputes, the policy should be that removed=deleted. I have changed the RfC page and the template for listings accordingly. Based on this, we have the following old listings that I believe should be deleted:</p>

<p>Because I don't have the ability to delete pages, I must ask the two of you to handle this chore. Additionally, this means that I can't continue to handle the task of removing uncertified RfC listings in the future, and either you or other admins will need to take responsibility for this. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 21:16, 20 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Angela,</p>
<p>As a mediation "old hand", I hope you can answer a couple of questions that don't seem to be addressed by the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_mediation_71be.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for mediation">Wikipedia:Requests for mediation</a> notes. What happens if an editor doesn't respond to a mediation request? And is there a set timescale for mediation - i.e. 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month or whatever? Grateful if you could clarify for me. BTW, with regard to the mediation that I've requested, I have no preferences as to who the mediator might be - I will accept anyone appointed by the committee. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 13:39, 22 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Angela</p>
<p>I wonder if I could solicit some advice from a more experienced Wikipedian. An anonymous user has been adding what looks like personal information to <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_20.html" title="April 20">April 20</a> and <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_18.html" title="April 18">April 18</a>. I asked for an explanation, got nothing, reverted it, asked on talk and their user talk. Got nothing. This happened a few times, so eventually I banned them for 24hrs. When the ban expired they came back, repeated the changed and posted a single comment, signing themselves <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_03fe.html" title="User:Michael">User:Michael</a>. Michael was before my time, but I've seen a lot of comments about him. I was considering a 7 day ban, but the signature inclines me to make it longer. Any thoughts or other suggestions you have would be welcome. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 15:37, 23 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>and for the tips. I'm unlikely to be a large-volume contributor but I am tickled pink by the concept of the Wiki-, and will be interested to watch how it works, and doesn't. Not being much of a Nethead means I have to wade through some of the jargon-concepts clicking on every sublink (trolling, etc) and I've had to engage my philosophy circuits as well, which can only be good!</p>

In light of the almost breakthrough with John_Kenny could you perhaps make some comments? Maybe even have a look at my version of the article.</p>

<p>As expected, my update was reverted over. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Papua_(Indonesian_province)&amp;oldid=3396526" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Papua_(Indonesian_province)&amp;oldid=3396526" rel="nofollow">This is my edition of West Papua article</a>.) Unlike their current version, my version does <b>not</b> paint Papuans as dumb black men being lead by his nose by a mission teacher; nor being saved from the Japanese by the brave white man. The whole of WW-II was barely noticed by most Papuans, those that meet the Japanese (the soldiers who'd been conditioned for the conquest and to dish out brutal treatment) quickly decided to avoid the Japanese; and disappeared into the jungles (so to speak). Nor where the Japanese going to spend ten divisons of men searching the New Guinea highlands for a people that didn't want to know them. Nor does my version say Papuans never knew there was an outside world, they've been traders for tens of thousands of years for goodness sakes.</p>
<p>They have taken the start of a good article and turned it into a weird mix of Hollywood and reality, with subtle innocent looking edits like changing "had taught" to "who taught" combined with removing the next sentence "<i>The teachers who graduated from the college became the source and pioneers of Pan-Papuan nationalism.</i>". Suddenly 'nationalism' sounds like a mission teachers nutty promotion, instead of something qualified teachers started talking with fellow Papuans about.</p>
<p>Am I wrong for suspecting Wik &amp; John would have the article on their Watch-list and would revert any input Tannin or I ever submit again.? Both the pages "Revision history" record, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Wik&amp;oldid=3374478#Papua_(or_whatever)" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Wik&amp;oldid=3374478#Papua_(or_whatever)" rel="nofollow">comments</a> by John to Wik, as well as other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Tannin#West_Papua" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Tannin#West_Papua" rel="nofollow">comments</a>; seem to me to suggest something along those lines.<a href="../../../d/a/e/User%7EDaeron_489a.html" title="User:Daeron">Daeron</a> 06:01, 1 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

Given the overwhelming support of the WikiPedia doctors (at <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_WikiDoc_0c2a.html" title="User:Jfdwolff/WikiDoc">WikiDoc</a>) I'm trying to change policy concerning the naming of medical articles. <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemistry.html" title="Chemistry">Chemistry</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biology.html" title="Biology">biology</a> items largely follow the "professional" nomenclature, and in my view <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medicine.html" title="Medicine">medicine</a> should follow suit. <a href="../../../k/s/h/User%7EKsheka_e2cf.html" title="User:Ksheka">User:Ksheka</a> tried to have <a href="../../../m/y/o/Myocardial_infarction.html" title="Myocardial infarction">Myocardial infarction</a> cleared so he could move [[heart attack]] there, but was shouted down for policy reasons (this featured in <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirects_for_deletion_955c.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirects for deletion">Wikipedia:Redirects for deletion</a> recently).<br />
I have raised this on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Naming_conventions_(common_names)#Naming_conventions_for_medicine" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Naming_conventions_(common_names)#Naming_conventions_for_medicine" rel="nofollow">"naming conventions" talk page</a>, but so far only my WikiDoc pals have been responding affirmatively.<br />
How do I get debate started on this issue? Who should have final say? Who will oversee the policy change?<br />
Your help is warmly appreciated. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff"></a><br />

<dd>Most of the discussion took page on the "redirects for deletion" page, but this has now been deleted. I'll try to retrieve it... Where do you suggest I submit all the details of the discussion?</dd>
<dd>As for the WikiDoc—you're right that this belongs on a WikiProject page. I've used the subpage to get some sense of an agenda. I'll try to move the whole kaboodle to a suitably-named WikiProject somewhere during the next few days (depending on domestic responsibilities.<a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff"></a><br />

<p>Hi Angela,</p>
<p>I created a pages where the sysops are listed on nl.wiktionary.org and I made a link to the page on meta.wiktionary.org. I have a few questions though. Do I also need to make a request on nl.wikipedia.org? The people there don't know me. It would make more sense to put a request for comments on www.wiktionary.org, as that's where I have been contributing quite actively for more than a year now. Many thanks, <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolyglot_c84e.html" title="User:Polyglot">Polyglot</a> 10:12, 2 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dutch is my mother language. I added a comment on Wiktionary so people from there can comment on my application. I'll add a comment on nl.wikipedia.org as well. I'm only not sure where to do it. They seem to have a form that's going to create an email to all the sysops. I would prefer to add it to a page, like I did on en.wiktionary and nl.wiktionary. I'll add it to their beer parlour counterpart. I also invited them to come and join in. It's a bit lonely out ther for the moment. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolyglot_c84e.html" title="User:Polyglot">Polyglot</a> 13:08, 2 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, Angela! Thanks for leting me know that someone accused <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_in_progress_33dc.html#Romanm" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism in progress">me being a vandal</a>.

<p>Your stub quotes page is a thing o' joy. It looks to be very much <i>your</i> page though, so I didn't add to it. However, my observation of stubs is that they are like seeds. Some fall on the hard grounds, where they die. Some are carried off by birds to be pooped out in places like E2 or other wikis. Some grow into tiny little plants, but as tiny little plant seeds, that've done all nature intended. But some go on to be great articles, all because someone thought to leave a little stub. <a href="../../../d/w/i/User%7EDwindrim_6e1c.html" title="User:Dwindrim">Denni</a> 20:48, 2004 May 2 (UTC)</p>

<p>A while back, you told me that links to Wikipedia space were unacceptable in article text as part of why the Critical Theory box needed changed. I've changed the box, and I'm more satisfied with its current form anyway, but I was just wondering if this was a hard rule or not. Both <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> do have links to Wikipedia space. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 00:06, 3 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for the clarification. I will treat them as "to be avoided if at all possible." Speaking of which, have you looked at the new box, and is it more acceptable? I've taken out all references to the WikiProject itself, I think. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 05:28, 3 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok... I'm jealous... your new user page is way better than my new user page...&#160;:(</p>
<p>On another point, are you planning to restore your compromise on <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schnorrer.html" title="Schnorrer">Schnorrer</a>? It would seem the best time for me to protect the page rather than when one side or the other has made their revert.

<p>This requires deletion of the link-w/-history <a href="../../../b/o/_/List_of_people_by_name%7E_Bo_202e.html" title="List of people by name: Bo">List of people by name: Bo</a> so that <a href="../../../b/o/-/List_of_people_by_name%7E_Bo-Bq_eeef.html" title="List of people by name: Bo-Bq">List of people by name: Bo-Bq</a> can be moved back to it. The ideal is to do this when we are both on simultaneously, so that i can immediately run around eliminating the double redirects that will result from the move, but IMO use of the ones that will become double is <i>very</i> light, so there is little harm to doing the deletion, with or without the move, and letting the doubles (and the MediaWiki: changes) ride for part of a day.</p>
