<p>Hello Anglius an welcome to Wikipedia. I see from your edit history that you are frequently editing biographical articles, changing references to a 'partner' to read 'mistress' instead. People from all over the world read and edit Wikipedia â€” most of them will have beliefs and morals that are different from your own. As such an important maxim of Wikipedia is that articles should be written from a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Netural Point of View</a>. I suggest you familiarise yourself with concept of NPOV and the <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_tutorial_6edc.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV tutorial">Wikipedia:NPOV tutorial</a>, otherwise you will find yourself in revert battles all over the place. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 07:45, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So does that mean that you understand the necessity for NPOV editing, or will you instead continue to change 'partner' to 'mistress'? -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 19:41, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While I appreciate as reader and editor a number of your edits I wonder why you removed Beethoven from <a href="../../../r/o/m/Category%7ERomanticism_61d0.html" title="Category:Romanticism">Category:Romanticism</a>?

<dd>You are welcome, Mr. Schissel, and I thank you for your appreciation. I apologise, but Herr van Beethoven was already 'in' the category of "Romantic composers," and I had 'added' other gentlemen to "Romanticism." <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAnglius_e80b.html" title="User:Anglius">Anglius</a></dd>

<p>... .&#160;??? What?? --- (and I would have missed this if I weren't watching this page - are you in the habit of responding on your own page and not e.g. on mine, which would have produced the proper warning signal and which is why it's done that way?) It's two a.m. and I should probably respond later, but the reason Beethoven was both in - should be in again - <a href="../../../r/o/m/Category%7ERomanticism_61d0.html" title="Category:Romanticism">Category:Romanticism</a> and also <a href="../../../r/o/m/Category%7ERomantic_composers_98c6.html" title="Category:Romantic composers">Category:Romantic composers</a> (or if dropped from one, from the <i>latter</i>! not the former) is, as discussed in those talk excerpts I pointed out to you and which you've read, because the categories are defined differently, overlapping- not disjunct- <i>but</i>: with neither a super- nor sub-category of the other.</p>
<p>One reason not to remove blank lines is for legibility and comprehensibility. I can't read this without some formatting; if you can, feel free as it's your talk page. The best reasons to remove a category are if they don't apply (Romanticism does, Beethoven both inspired the movement and was influenced by it) or if a more specific category is already there (<a href="../../../r/o/m/Category%7ERomantic_composers_98c6.html" title="Category:Romantic composers">Category:Romantic composers</a> doesn't apply here - it's not the collection of composers who would appear under <a href="../../../r/o/m/Category%7ERomanticism_61d0.html" title="Category:Romanticism">Category:Romanticism</a>, to be logical-strict about it, it's about what are called Romantic composers by the caprice of language but that is not, as Mr. Newberry was right to point out, the same thing. Which is why I'm replacing the category links. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchissel_09fc.html" title="User:Schissel">Schissel</a>&#160;: <a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchissel_dfe5.html" title="User talk:Schissel"><i>bowl listen</i></a> 06:36, Jun 6, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I thank you for your advice, Mr. Schissel, and I apologise for any inconvenience. However, one must attempt to "save space." I agree, nonetheless, that Ludwig van Beethoven was influential in establishing the Romantic school of music. Other Romantic composers, Herr Schumann for instance, were not, and, therefore, do not belong in both categories. I would like inquire, sir, as whether Ludwig van Beethoven and Johannes Brahms could be considered to have been Viennese composers. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAnglius_e80b.html" title="User:Anglius">Anglius</a> 17:59, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Good day, sir. I see that you have been engaged in the task of sorting articles into categories, and thought it worth informing you of a technical matter relevant to the category system. When an article is added to a category by means of a tag such as "[[Category:Organists]]", it appears on the category pageâ€”in this case <a href="../../../o/r/g/Category%7EOrganists_e855.html" title="Category:Organists">Category:Organists</a>â€”sorted alphabetically according to the first letter of its title. For biographical articles, this causes categories to list their contents by first name, instead of by surname, which would usually be preferred, and is probably expected by the reader in most cases. It is, however, possible to specify a 'sort key' for the category, by using a tag such as "[[Category:Organists|Marchand, Louis]]". This causes the article to be sorted according to the surname of its subject. Indeed, it is possible to specify any 'sort key' one wishes, so that "[[Category:Organists|Hello]]" would sort the article on the category page as if it were titled "Hello". Such usage is necessary in certain circumstances, but for the greater part of biographical articles, convention dictates that the category tag's 'sort key' should take the form "Surname, First Middle etc." I offer my apologies if this explanation is unclear. Further information may be found at <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategorization_21c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Categorization">Wikipedia:Categorization</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/t/Help%7ECategory_8000.html" title="Help:Category">Help:Category</a>, if you should have need to consult the 'official' documentation. â€” <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilobite_212d.html" title="User:Trilobite">Trilobite</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETrilobite_e418.html" title="User talk:Trilobite">Talk</a>) 00:26, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello again, Anglius. I would quite understand if you were to ignore this message on the grounds that your "gynephobia" is no business of mine; however, since you have voted to oppose a candidate for adminship for this very reason, I thought it worth asking a question of you. First, let me say that I noticed your name amongst the contributors to various articles I have been looking at recently, and was initially pleased to see that you were an editor here. Your interests and opinions, as stated on your user page, contrast greatly with some of those held by most of Wikipedia's contributors, who tend to be young, liberal, secular, Western, male and somewhat technically-inclined (I include myself). Actually we are a fairly homogeneous group, and I was glad that a gentleman such as yourself had chosen to join us. Your manner of addressing people as "sir" on talk pages marks you out immediately as an interesting contributor. Having seen all this and thought it promising, it concerned me greatly to see that you had voted to oppose a request for adminship for what were, as far as I could see, purely prejudicial reasons. I understand that you "detest political correctness" and may not accept it as obvious that men and women could be equally competent at the tasks an administrator here is asked to perform (though I tend to think of the concept of political correctness as having more to do with terminology and the <a href="../../../e/u/p/Euphemism.html#The_.22euphemism_treadmill.22" title="Euphemism">euphemism treadmill</a>), but it puzzles me that you would actively oppose a female candidate for reasons that seem to be unrelated to the record she has established as a contributor. I have been a little long-winded, but here is my question:</p>
<dl>
<dd>What is it, in your view, that makes a woman an unsuitable candidate to be an administrator?</dd>
</dl>
<p>I do not wish to be critical of your opinionsâ€”although I may not share themâ€”I am simply genuinely curious as to why an apparently educated and intelligent person would hold such an opinion. I would be pleased if you could offer some insight, but will leave you in peace if you choose not to. â€” <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilobite_212d.html" title="User:Trilobite">Trilobite</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETrilobite_e418.html" title="User talk:Trilobite">Talk</a>) 20:01, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Salutations, sir. I appreciate your courtesy and recognition. I must admit that I dislike 'computers' but may be required to work with them. They are very unconventional machines, and it can be distressing for one to realise how wantonly untraditional and perverse the world is and how it is seemily in deteoration.

<p>You are a troll. Your combination of misogyny, homophobia, and bigoted bible-thumping has irked me enough that I must tell you this: <b>Stop fagging up Wikipedia.</b> You've done nothing but disrupt this community and exploit our tolerance of nutjobs such as yourself. Most of the people I've spoken to on IRC are are at least annoyed and at most want you dead. Your edits range from chauvinistic comments to changing dates without citing sources.

<dd>No, Mr. Greer, I am not a "troll," and I would appreciate if you would not speak to me in such vulgar language. I usually write references when I alter dates, at least whenever they needed.

<dd>Although I wouldn't be as blunt and straight-forward as AngryParsley, he does have a point. Your edit pattern seems quite odd and you've made changes which suggest the pushing of a POV (significant people &gt; significant men, for example). Also, edits with summaries such as "was <i>probably</i> born after" seem to look like they've come off unsourced, un-backed up knowledge (guess work on your behalf, basically).

<p>Anglius, I wonder if I can offer some assistance here, and I hope you will forgive the length of this message. It seems to me that several misunderstandings and difficulties have arisen. Part of the problem is that you appear to hold some highly unconventional views, such as considering women unfit for adminship. While this is somewhat offensive to most of us, it need not preclude you from contributing to and editing Wikipedia. I would like to think that the more diverse our contributors, the better the encyclopÃ¦dia can become, so if you are a legitimate contributor acting in good faith I would very much like you to stay with us if that is what you wish to do. It seems, however, that I may be in the minority in considering you a legitimate contributor. If you do turn out to be a troll, I will look a fool for suggesting otherwise, but it's a risk I'm prepared to take. If you are a troll, you are the most interesting I have encountered yet, because the more I look into your contributions the more evidence there appears to be that you are not one.</p>
<p>The other part of the problem is that many of us appear not to know quite what to make of you. A good example of an apparent misunderstanding of your intentions here concerns your use of inverted commas with people's usernames. I appreciate that to you it may seem odd to address everyone by their pseudonyms, but this is almost universal practice here, and your insistence on inverted commasâ€”while it may seem a minor matterâ€”can suggest a certain contempt, or a failure to take those with whom you are communicating seriously. Those who edit under a real name are in a minority here, and the practice of adopting a pseudonym for Wikipedia extends even to distinguished professors of philosophy and other experts in their fields. A particularly egalitarian spirit prevails here, in which contributors are judged on their merits and not on who they are or what qualifications they might hold in the 'outside world'. As I'm quite sure you will have noticed, this is a very unusual encyclopÃ¦dia; indeed, the manner of its creation is unprecedented. While articles themselves are generally written in a fairly 'professional' style, communications between users on talk pages are usually much more informal. As such, your formal manner is potentially confusing to many.</p>
<p>I would not presume to dictate to you how you should compose your messages; indeed, I am quite willing to communicate with you on your own terms, and being addressed as "sir" does not offend me in the slightest. However, others appear not to share this view. If you would like me to go into further detail about why you appear to many to be a troll I will happily do so. You may also find that the article on <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_troll.html" title="Internet troll">internet trolls</a> will shed some light on the matter, though much of it may seem a little esoteric to one who professes a dislike of computers, and is in any case not really applicable to these particular circumstances. Suffice it to say that given the open nature of this project, we are constantly faced with a minority who wish to disrupt and destroy what we have created. Some attempt simple vandalism, but this is easily corrected, while others are more insidious and make claims to be editing in good faith, while doing much to waste the time and try the patience of those who seek to maintain what we like to think of as a harmonious community, devoted to the task of writing an encyclopÃ¦dia.</p>
<p>If you intend to contribute material to Wikipedia in any area, provided this is done in accordance with our various policies on such matters as neutrality and verifiability, I am quite sure your work will be valued and appreciated by everyone. At the moment, it appears the three things you have become most widely known for are your opposition to an otherwise unanimous RfA on some very odd grounds, your formal manner of addressing people (which seems to be causing more of a problem than it should be), and your inexplicable removal of line spacing above headings, which I should point out makes the article's appearance no different to the reader in most cases, but does make its editable text somewhat illegible for other editors. I hope I have gone some way to explaining why you are receiving angry messages or accusations of trolling. If you require any further clarification or assistance I would be pleased to help you. â€” <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilobite_212d.html" title="User:Trilobite">Trilobite</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETrilobite_e418.html" title="User talk:Trilobite">Talk</a>) 20:43, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Anglius,</p>
<p>The reason why I closed your RFA early was because there was, frankly, no possible way that you would have recieved an 80% consensus. You had 34 oppose votes to zero support votes. Assuming you received no additional oppose votes, you would require an absolute minimum of 136 support votes to reach an 80% support rate. There was no reasonable chance of you reaching that, and as such I exercised my bureaucratic privileges and closed the RFA early.

<dd>Let me give you some good advice on how to go about doing much better on Wikipedia. I think you are far too proud and outspoken to fit in on Wikipedia. I am giving you this advice for your own benefit - it's your choice whether or not you take it. If you want to be more liked, you need to try to work on your articles in facts, not just searching for <i>facts</i> on Wikipedia which contravene your own moral standards or opinion. I also suggest that you refrain from speaking in such a formal tone - it does come across as highly patronising. This includes your addressing of people by "Sir" and "Madam", and your use of "inverted commas" around people's nicknames. I understand that the language you use to communicate on Wikipedia is used in <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a>, but your tone of voice is not evident on Wikipedia, and your use of this language does come across as patronising. Furthermore, I would suggest that you refrain from discrimination on any grounds, as it is highly frowned upon by the Wikipedia community. Your opposition of <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a>'s RFA based on her sex was one of the main reasons why your RFA was opposed. The other primary reason was your overly formal tone that you use. In other words, the main reason why you are not appreciated on Wikipedia is because you are too outspoken with your opinion. Please, just relax and try to remember that this is an objective encyclopedia, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">NOT</a> a censored one. Also remember that a large part of a project such as this is colloboration, and discrimination and apparent condescension do not assist in colloboration. Please bear my comments in mind, or you will not fit in very well on Wikipedia, and you will run into a significant amount of trouble in the future.

<dd>During an anti-humour spring clean, I ditched your foul user-page last week - and so I have only just read this query. In response - Item: <i>Bolleex</i> instead of the pompous <i>Bollocks</i>. Item: <i>How's she cuttin'?</i> instead of the insufferable <i>How do you do?</i> Item: <i>Holy Mary mother of God!</i> instead of the outrageous <i>Oh dear</i>. I do admit a flaw in my argument - the English never copped on, never learned their lesson - but it remains a truth universally recognised, that the English surrendered all authority over their own language when they got jiggy with it during the "Victorian" era, and swamped this beautiful thing in standardised spelling, diction, pronunciation and style. The champions of the language over the past century have been Irishmen in hedgerows and cow-pat burning Newfoundlanders. Besides, joinder of these issues is moot: modern English may be taking over the world, but when the aliens arrive they will be speaking in binary code, the language that American space-boffins have been teaching them by radio-wave since the first broadcast of sci-fi programs in the "so-called" 1950s.--<a href="../../../s/h/t/User%7EShtove_8f32.html" title="User:Shtove">shtove</a> 23:53, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What sort of social rank would one have to bear in their family, in order to be a descendent of either?</p>
<p>How far up the totem pole, would you say?</p>
<p>This is intended to have broad answers and based on gradients of time and population, not going into specifics about exact descendents. About how common is their descent in the English or British genepool today?</p>
<p>I've noticed that American Presidents don't descend from either king, but the most common recent royal ancestor shared by many of us is Edward III. How common is it for anybody in the English or British genepool, to have a Protestant royal ancestor?</p>
<p>There is a general cutoff, isn't there?</p>
<p>Is it because of fratricide in the Wars of the Roses, the Tudors' "new men", or the Union of the Crowns, or the parliamentary union under Queen Anne (I can't think of any non-royal family descent from the Hanoverians within the UK)?</p>
<p>I'm thinking that there is a big difference between Plantagenet and Tudor descents, that the commons in all likelihood have the former and the latter is held by the lords. (just generally speaking) Then again, Tudor descent in the Welsh must be higher in general. I am further curious about pre-Royal Tudor blood in Anglo-British people today, since the status and/or concept of Welsh royalty/nobility is rather hazy in my mind. I found the Blevins aka Ap Bleddyn family of Powys in my ancestry, but have no real idea on what to make of it--or any other Welsh "native aristocracy". I might be able to find Stewart descent somewhere, from way back when. What percentage of Hanoverian background do you think that German colonists had in America?</p>
<p>On the British side, I have to go as far back as Welf himself...but any recent genetic relationship with the Hanoverians or the counts of Nassau are completely obscure. How does one research those other colonial people, such as the Hessians?</p>
<p>UK genealogy is relatively easy when focusing on English (and French) ancestries. What would a "national person" of Jerusalem (or Antioch, for example) in Crusader times be known as?</p>
<p>We say "American" for those Founders, but was there such a nationality-term for the Crusaders in their own domains?</p>
<p>I guess the term is supposed to be Levantine/Outremer, or "Crusader" as our national heritage says "Colonist"...</p>

<dd>My dear sir, I would think that there would many people who are, sir-reverence, illegitimately descended from Edward IV. In addition, I read that one-quarter of the people in Europe are descended from Charlemagne (that is probably an exaggeration.) I think that one of the reasons that there are not that many legitimate descendants of English Kings after 1460 and Scottish monarchs after approximately 1530 is that they began to restrict the marriages of their children more (E.g. One should remember how angry Henry VIII became when he learned that his sister had married the Duke of Suffolk.) I apologise that I do not possess much time to discuss this at the present.

<p>True, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Byrd_2e6a.html" title="Robert Byrd">Robert Byrd</a> is younger than <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Byrd_185e.html" title="Harry Byrd">Harry Byrd</a>... and if the succession box said he was the oldest living senator (as <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clifford_Hansen_98e0.html" title="Clifford Hansen">Clifford Hansen</a>'s page says) then it would've been incorrect. However, it says, most Senior living senator, Robert Byrd took the oath on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_3.html" title="January 3">January 3</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a>, more than 6 years before Harry Byrd therefore he has senirotiy to him. In fact Claiborne Pell, James B. Pearson , Ted Kennedy, Daniel Brewster, George McGovern, Daniel Inouye, Birch Bayh, Fred R. Harris, and Walter Mondale are all still alive and have higher original seniority to Harry Byrd. He's 11th on the list. As for age, he is the 2nd oldest living U.S. Senator after Hanson. All of this information is and has been available at <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earliest_living_US_senator_cb49.html" title="Earliest living US senator">Earliest living US senator</a> which is the link in the middle the succession box that you could've clicked on.--<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_who1975_66e5.html" title="User:Dr who1975">Dr who1975</a> 19:30, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
