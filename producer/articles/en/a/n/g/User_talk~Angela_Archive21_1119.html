<p>Hi Angela, haven't bothered you for ages. Someone keeps editting Cape Verde to put a travel company on it (three or four links to sections of the same company). It is pretty low level stuff. About five people (lately me) keep reverting it but it is getting boring... have a look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cape_Verde&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cape_Verde&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Could you add the site to a blocklist somewhere to save everyone the trouble? I have tried leaving a request on a couple of the IPs to stop. --<a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a> <a href="../../../b/o/z/User_talk%7EBozMo_4fce.html" title="User talk:BozMo">talk</a> 06:48, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It doesn't seem widespread enough to add a block to the global blacklist since that affects not only all Wikimedia sites, but many third-party users of MediaWiki too. There's a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Spam_bdee.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Spam">WikiProject for Spam</a> now so it may be worth reporting it there. Otherwise, you can keep a check on this using <a href="../../../l/i/n/Special%7ELinksearch__.capeverdebreaks.com_219f.html" title="Special:Linksearch/*.capeverdebreaks.com">Special:Linksearch/*.capeverdebreaks.com</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 07:16, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Angela, I just saw several new Wikipedias were created, including one in Zeelandic. Great, but I can't find my articles anywhere, neither at incubator, nor at zea:. Where have they gone? ave they simply disappeared? I hope not... Regards, <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteinbach_5cf8.html" title="User:Steinbach">Steinbach <small>(fka Caesarion)</small></a> 18:51, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>PS I know you're not a developer but since you live with one and you were one of the very first to enregister at this Wikipedia I hope you can tell me...</p>

<p>I only recently stumbled across "Wikitruth". Could it be that this anti-Wikipedia site has been created by multiple hardbanned <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETed_Wilkes_458b.html" title="User:Ted Wilkes">User:Ted Wilkes</a> alias <a href="../../../d/w/_/User%7EDW_b2cc.html" title="User:DW">User:DW</a> alias <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightCrawler_eab6.html" title="User:NightCrawler">User:NightCrawler</a> and his many other sockpuppets? DW was under a hard ban since 2003 (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:DW&amp;oldid=1751194" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:DW&amp;oldid=1751194" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>) and "has been <a href="../../../b/p/_/WP%7EBP_c8aa.html" title="WP:BP">blocked indefinitely</a> from editing Wikipedia, per ruling of <a href="../../../a/d/m/WP%7EADMIN_f0df.html" title="WP:ADMIN">administrators</a>, <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a>", etc. in 2005. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:DW&amp;oldid=27381050" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:DW&amp;oldid=27381050" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:DW&amp;oldid=68892617" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:DW&amp;oldid=68892617" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. One of the criticisms against Wikipedia centers on Jimbo Wales and the <a href="../../../o/f/f/Wikipedia%7EOffice_Actions_5803.html" title="Wikipedia:Office Actions">Wikipedia:Office Actions</a> page which deals with certain legal issues. Ted Wilkes claimed to have much legal knowledge and used this knowledge in his mud-throwing campaign against arbcom member Fred Bauder. Wilkes, who plumed himself on being one of the best and most active contributors to Wikipedia, was blocked by arbcom ruling on 19 March 2006 for one year. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ted_Wilkes#Blocked_per_arbcom_ruling" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ted_Wilkes#Blocked_per_arbcom_ruling" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. Is it just mere coincidence that Wikitruth was started shortly after that date, on 20 March 2006? His alias NightCrawler had much trouble with you, ironically wishing you "WikiLove," etc. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Angela/Archive1&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1751029" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Angela/Archive1&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1751029" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/NightCrawler" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/NightCrawler" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. Significantly, you are attacked on the Wikitruth pages. Furthermore, administrator FCYTravis is one of Wikitruth's whipping boys, presumably because Ted Wilkes had some trouble with this administrator on the <a href="../../../n/i/c/Talk%7ENick_Adams_3fe6.html" title="Talk:Nick Adams">Talk:Nick Adams</a> page.

Wikitruth also frequently claims that too many vandals and trolls "game the system" on Wikipedia. Is it just by chance that Wilkes and his supporter <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">User:Wyss</a> frequently accused user Onefortyone of gaming the system, being a troll, the "most dangerous vandal", etc., falsely claiming that this user's edits were fabricated, unfounded, or unwarranted and therefore must be removed.

<p>Hi, I have some questions on the reason you gave for the Dangerous Scripts revision. "it's not encyclopedic to show how people can make danerous scripts"</p>
<p>There is an article on Wikipedia showing how to make Dry ice bombs which could cause permanent hearing damage, is illegal in some areas and could be construed as public endangerment if they're left unexploded. There are also articles on Amish Bombs and Spud guns with instructions on how to make them. Those are much more dangerous than dangerous scripts.</p>
<p>I would like to revert the page to its previous state if you have no objections.</p>

<dd>I do object, both because I don't believe adding these scripts is beneficial to the article, and also because there are no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> for this. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 07:29, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello Angela,</p>
<p>I created a wikipedia entry for myself stating my name, birthdate, and birth city. I even put up a picture of myself.</p>
<p>I didn't want to promote myself in any way, so I didn't include any links to my web sites.</p>
<p>I was in the procrastinating mood, so I didn't add much content at all, marked the article as a stub, and put a link to it on my website, asking people to go ahead and fill in the stuff themselves.</p>
<p>You deleted my article, Jon Ivy.</p>
<p>I do not have a big enough ego to be angry about deletion.</p>
<p>I do wonder why you gave no mention to me, in any way, as to WHY you deleted the article. I thought I was following the rules, and if not, could you tell me how I can restart my article without a fear of deletion?</p>

<dd>I deleted it because someone had tagged it <a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-bio_ac6d.html" title="Template:Db-bio">{{Db-bio}}</a>, meaning "it is an article about a person that does not assert the importance or significance of the subject."

<p>Angela, I just left this note also for Anthere but I think she isn't around. Could you answer perhaps? It is a long shot not a promise... Boz Anthere, On one other thing could you tell me roughly what WP's five year funding need is: $1m/year? $2m/year? I have a meeting in a week on another topic with a possible (not for Profit) funder who conceivably might be prepared to take on the whole cost on a "non-commercial, no editorial input" basis. I don't get in to see these kind of people often, but I don't mind sowing some seeds in their mind if you think this sensible?

<p>Hello Angela. I am contacting you because you have previously made me an sysop under the name "SWD316" on the Pro wrestling WikiCity located <a href="http://prowrestling.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://prowrestling.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I am in desperate need of being a Bureaucrat there as others have asked me about the lack of activity there and them needing sysop abilities. I personally also need to change my username from "SWD316" to "Moe Epsilon" there so everything matches on all the other wikis. If you could give me bureaucrat access there, it could surely help things run smoother.

<dd>I have no problem with waiting in regards for new users to build trust in the community. I didn't realize renaming on Wikia was impossible. If I make the account Moe Epsilon, could you make that an admin instead of SWD316? I don't like using the SWD316 name on any wiki now as it confuses others and myself.

<p>Hi Angela, I once asked because I wanted to find out how to create music templates, and you answered back <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Luis_Mar%C3%ADa_Ben%C3%ADtez&amp;diff=23793252&amp;oldid=22939158" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Luis_Mar%C3%ADa_Ben%C3%ADtez&amp;diff=23793252&amp;oldid=22939158" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Well, originally I created several templates copying the old format of <a href="../../../t/h/e/Template%7EThe_Beatles_af0c.html" title="Template:The Beatles">Template:The Beatles</a> which originally featured small pics <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:The_Beatles&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=19646116" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:The_Beatles&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=19646116" rel="nofollow">see</a>. But the music templates have changed its format and now pictures are no longer used. Therefore, some of the images I used on my templates became orphan and I got a message notifying this (you can still see this on my talk page). This is one of the templates I had created with pics <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:KUKL&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=48201458" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:KUKL&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=48201458" rel="nofollow">take a look</a></p>
<p>Well, the reason I'm telling you all this is because a few administrators from the Spanish version say that I'm lying and that I'm talking sillyness. They don't believe anything I say. So please, could you tell them the truth? I mean, that it was originally possible to put these pics, but now as this is no longer in use, there was no reason to keep them (and I agree). I'm being the target and my work has been vilified due to the fact that I have claimed accusations of censorship and other irregularities. This is the section I started to defend myself: <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Caf%C3%A9/Portal/Archivo/Miscel%C3%A1nea/Actual&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=5219935" class="external text" title="http://es.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Caf%C3%A9/Portal/Archivo/Miscel%C3%A1nea/Actual&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=5219935" rel="nofollow">here</a> (I'll provide you with a accurate translation) Kind regards, <a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuis_Mar%C3%ADa_Ben%C3%ADtez_469f.html" title="User:Luis María Benítez">Luis María Benítez</a> 00:00, 21 October 2006 (UTC)<br /></p>

<dd>What is it they don't believe? That the images were deleted? Or that they were originally in the template?

<p>They don't believe those images were used on the music templates, but I told them that you taught me how to create them, by providing a few links. So, I originally copied the format used on the Beatles template, which featured images from each member. I did the same with my templates (originally) and when the format was changed, I removed several images and therefore I got the notification (as you could see on my talk page) for the removal since they became orphan. They don't believe anything of this, and claim I'm lying!</p>
<p>It doesn't matter whether I show them that you taught me how to create this templates, that these images were deleted because they were no longer in use. They insist in saying that I'm lying and that those warnings are examples of my infringements to the rules.</p>
<p>And they claim that I had created sock puppets because my original username was <a href="../../../l/m/b/User%7ELmb_9b39.html" title="User:Lmb">User:Lmb</a> can you believe that? I had written several articles which obtained featured status under my previous user name, but they say I did it because I'm a vandal.</p>
<p>When I tell you what's going on over there, you will be very surprised. I'm sorry to bring this topic here, but they are mostly biased over there. This explains why I had to ask an administrator from the English version.<br />
This is due to the fact that I've been complaining and showing compelling evidence about censorship and irregularities on behalf of a few administrators, especially two of them. They delete discussions were evidence is presented, and make charges against me without any serious foundation. I've been blocked 3 times because of this and because I uploaded an "offfensive drawing" where I wanted to reflect how I feel.<br />
I will provide you with a translation and let you know more about how it all started (next Monday). Kind regards, <a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuis_Mar%C3%ADa_Ben%C3%ADtez_469f.html" title="User:Luis María Benítez">Luis María Benítez</a> 14:16, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>All these nasty people are administrators (that's how they talk). Visitante was another user who was kicked out because of writing a report about censorship on the Spanish version. As his line of argumentation lacked foundation in several topics, that report was heavily criticized, but nowadays, everyone who wants to point out either a biased edition or inexcusable cursing, is put you on the spot! About 10 days ago I started to keep tabs on a few administrators and I just went speechless: I felt like an UFO expert trawling through the secret archives of Area 51! He he he. I’ll let you know when I publish my report also in English. What do you think I should do if they keep on deleting my messages?

<dd>If the community there finds what you're doing offensive, perhaps you should just stop doing it? Are there any mediators of the Spanish Wikipedia?

<p>It's all rigged (is that the correct expression?). I have posted several messages where I ruled out all the charges against me, and provided some evidence about their behaviour, but they have all chickened out and deleted all those messages. That's something I never saw in the Spanish version. One of the administrators said that it doesn't matter what his colleagues could do (even if they infringed the rules). So, more and more people are moving to the English version. I never saw administrators here cursing as the Spanish administrators. All people who complained about this were blocked for the eternity, so this is leading to an exodus.

<p>I think I gave a fairly good explanation at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Halopedia_%28second_nomination%29_18c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Halopedia (second nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Halopedia (second nomination)</a> which was linked in the log - so I'm hardly covering things up.

If you are objecting to the use of the word "consensus" in the edit summary I'll take that as constructive criticism.

<dl>
<dd>I didn't quote the inclusion of other articles. It's the claim of consensus to delete when 8 out of 11 people want an article kept. Wikipedia usually errs on the side of inclusion, not deletion, so I don't see how this deletion is justifiable. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 03:36, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You didn't quote the inclusion of other articles, but the other people whom you stated presented "good arguments backed up by policy" did, and, as I stated above, your personal arguments were countered by <a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhatru2_6f16.html" title="User:Khatru2">Khatru2</a>'s. There were no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, and nobody provided any during the course of the AfD (despite requests to do so) which suggests there aren't any. Hence the article fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, and by extension <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> (and to top it off it isn't exactly NPOV). As I've said the word "consensus" in the deletion log may have been the wrong choice, but since the debate is linked anybody who is interested has access to the both the discussion and my rationale in closing. I can't imagine anybody who is interested enough to check the statement in the deletion log, that wouldn't be interested enough to click on the link, can you? I haven't protected it, so there's no reason it can't be recreated, but to keep it and strip out all the uncited information and opinion would have left one line which would have failed <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> anyway. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 11:12, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello Angela, I just wanted to state the reason I placed the posting in the discussion page.</p>
<p>The first being that in the past the Braham Kumaris members delete their talk pages and hide the history of events. The second being that the following actually is on topic, some of which they have sought to have deleted and others that have yet to be introduced into the article. So, that was the reason for placing it there, as the history will document there is a pattern of personal attacks upon anyone that brings forth these issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Child Abuse</li>
<li>Child sexual abuse</li>
<li>Ex-Member attempting suicide</li>
<li>Ex-Members committing suicide</li>
<li>Member being asked to break all contact with their families</li>
<li>Ex-Members having severe psychological problems due to the Tenets/Teachings/Indoctrination</li>
<li>Ex-Members not being offered any Exit counseling.....</li>
<li>Destruction</li>
</ul>
<p>So, I shall see how long it stays on his talk page. I don't delete what they place on mine. Regards<a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalkAbout_6f36.html" title="User:TalkAbout">TalkAbout</a> 15:51, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you're concerned about replies being deleted, you could keep your reply on your own talk page and rely on the other person having that page watchlisted and seeing the reply there.

However, <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Starling_d5f6.html" title="User:Tim Starling">Tim Starling</a> thinks it shouldn't be there since it's not a wiki (though Wikia have done it that way for years).

<dd>Thanx for the help, neither [callto://skypeID] nor SkypeMe:YourSkypeId works.</dd>
</dl>
<p>i know that this isnt a wiki, but neither is a link to an external website or an email address. this is a way of contacting the author of the post. If you find a method of making this work please post it here, thanx again for taking the time to respond. regards - simon ps.the site i would like to use this on is www.goplett.co.za</p>

<dl>
<dd>Don't put the &lt;nowiki&gt; tags around it. I just did that to demonstrate the code to you. [callto://skypeID] displays as [callto://skypeID] which does work. You can also do [callto://skypeID SkypeMe] which displays as [callto://skypeID SkypeMe] or the plain callto://skypeID on its own.</dd>

<dd>I thought you were asking me about using this <i>on Wikipedia</i>. I can't make it work on a non-Wikia site. You need to fix that yourself. Find wherever the mailto handling is and adapt that file, or install your own interwiki map. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 11:41, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Angela,<br />
Since your intervention regarding the forest fire (<a href="../../../t/a/l/User_talk%7ETalkAbout_f1a8.html#NPA" title="User talk:TalkAbout">User_talk:TalkAbout#NPA</a>) I replied to the post in a way I felt appropriate and received a return NPA on my talk page <a href="../../../b/k/s/User_talk%7EBksimonb_9590.html" title="User talk:Bksimonb">User_talk:Bksimonb</a>. As I see it I was merely advising that ranting on the article discussion page (that you removed) is not desirable. I would really appreciated it if you could let me know if you feel the NPA against me is bogus or if I did indeed go too far. I will then know whether to reject the NPA or apologise and accept it as appropriate. If it is inappropriate do I just delete it?<br />

<dd>I don't know what you mean by reject an NPA. <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">NPA</a> is policy and you need to adhere to it, not find ways around it to offend people. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a></dd>

<dd>Hi Angela, sorry that was a bad choice of words on my part and also ambiguous. I meant to ask what to do if I strongly suspect an {{npa2}} has been issued to me where no breach of NPA took place [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Bksimonb#NPA_to_Bksimonb" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Bksimonb#NPA_to_Bksimonb" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>] i.e. I have not actually intended to nor believe I actually carried out a personal attack or to offend.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dd>Certainly my response to talkabout [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:TalkAbout#NPA" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:TalkAbout#NPA" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>] was strongly worded and assertive but I thought it appropriate to make it clear to User:Talkabout that I object to,
<ul>

<li>Plastering the accusation on the article discussion page (forest fire).</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The allegations and presumption of bad faith have continued right up until the latest post by Talkabout, 'What I see here is that you are trying to work the system to hide your true practices, to suit your PR needs under a shield of "verifiable" sources approved by your members, while leaving others out that are quite legitimate.'</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I hope you appreciate that it is not much fun being targeted by a smear campaign and right now I would just like the personal attacks to stop. I have no personal interest in finding out who Talkabout really is nor do I see any need to abuse Wikipedia. All I have ever tried to accomplish is an article to normal encyclopedic standards because I am confident that in itself will result in a more balanced article on the BKWSU.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Right now the immediate problem (apart from the article itself) is a lack of civility on the talk page. I am trying to address this by what I understand to be the correct procedures. I would be grateful for any advice you can offer on how best to proceed.</dd>

<p>Hi Glen. I was just wondering how you knew <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDancingfordarfur_7f7c.html" title="User talk:Dancingfordarfur">this user</a> was editing through an open proxy. I saw Dancing for Darfur listed for speedy deletion and thought it was worth saving for the <a href="http://www.wikia.com/wiki/c:darfur:Dancing_for_Darfur" class="extiw" title="wikiasite:darfur:Dancing_for_Darfur">Darfur Wiki</a>, but perhaps not if the user is being problematic. I'd appreciate more information on this.

<dd>It was pointed out to me in the admin channel by an observant user. If you check their contribs <a href="../../../u/n/d/Special%7EUndelete_Dancing_for_Darfur_808b.html" title="Special:Undelete/Dancing for Darfur">here</a> you'll notice the backslashing... I dont know why but when users edit though open proxys they appear everywhere (I even tried to confirm).</dd>

<dd>If they're in <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darfur.html" title="Darfur">Darfur</a>, they may have a perfectly valid reason for using an open proxy. I'm not aware of any edits other than that article being created (and only once), so the block before they've had a chance to respond to the first warning seems unfair. It's only using open proxies maliciously that's a problem, not using them in general, unless there has been previous spamming of this domain that I'm unaware of. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 13:18, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The user obviously noticed the blackslashes, as he went to remove some of it, but just kept producing more of them.

<dd>(Edit conflict) Ok my apologies. Policy states <i>"Users are forbidden from editing Wikimedia projects through open or anonymous proxies."</i> and that they may be indef blocked by any admin at any time so I have never actually looked to see if they are used abusively or not.

<dd>Charlotte's point makes sense.

<dd>I'm extremely puzzled and disappointed by this whole situation. I contacted BuffyGuide through <a href="http://www.buffyguide.com/mail/contact.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.buffyguide.com/mail/contact.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.buffyguide.com/mail/contact.shtml</a> to ask whether they were interested in sharing the short summaries on Wikipedia. I offered to create a ghost account called 'BuffyGuide.com' which would represent the site and the respect work (since this was not allowed I created 'BuffyGuide'). I did this with premission and agreement because I told the web master that I did not deserve credit for adding these summaries to Wikipdeia when the much harder work was their creation. My workplace blocks access to email right now, but I'm sure I will still have those emails detailing our correspondence over this issue. I have explained the situation to the user, <a href="../../../a/c/t/User%7EActual_BuffyGuide_f720.html" title="User:Actual BuffyGuide">Actual BuffyGuide</a> <a href="../../../a/c/t/User_talk%7EActual_BuffyGuide_8df7.html" title="User talk:Actual BuffyGuide">here</a>, hopefully this whole situation will be cleared up, because to be honest I am very confused as to why I was told that using the summaries was fine after contacting the site through <a href="http://www.buffyguide.com/mail/contact.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.buffyguide.com/mail/contact.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.buffyguide.com/mail/contact.shtml</a>, and now <a href="../../../a/c/t/User%7EActual_BuffyGuide_f720.html" title="User:Actual BuffyGuide">Actual BuffyGuide</a> are stating that material has been used without permission? I will find those emails later when I have access to my email, and also email the web master again to find out what is going on?</dd>

<dd>At the time you felt Google searches can't help, but my work has now produced results that clearly show current use on reputable sites (plus other encyclopedias!). In addition, there is danger of my proposed move being rejected due to opinions that disregard basic WP policies. This is a prominent article with a foreign name which therefore erodes one of WP's most basic policies. I see you're an admin and would therefore like to ask you to spend a few seconds reading my nomination (quoted here) or a few minutes reading my responses to the erroneous arguments in the opposing votes:</dd>

<dd>By restricting Google searches to reputable sites, e.g. edu domains or UK or Canadian universities, it is very easy to prove that the current title is nonsense in addition to violating WP policy. <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28use_English%29_65c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English)">Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_(use_English)</a> says clearly <i>use the most commonly used English version of the name for the article, as you would find it in other encyclopedias and reference works.</i> Even highly educated people only very rarely say the French name in the middle of an English sentence. And Encyclopædia Britannica and other reference works therefore also obviously have the English title.</dd>

<p>Ah, yes I know.

If it only had that template it would possibly explain why it wasnt moved to the new username.

<dd>That's what's meant to happen when you rename a user.

<dd>Ok, forgive my confusion. It seems that the {{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUsernameBlocked_b445.html" title="Template:UsernameBlocked">UsernameBlocked</a>}} template was still on the page after the move (as one would expect) and Misza saw the <a href="../../../t/e/m/Category%7ETemporary_Wikipedian_userpages_417b.html" title="Category:Temporary Wikipedian userpages">Category: Temporary Wikipedian userpages</a> on the page and deleted it after a month (probably assuming it was an old page from a user since moved on). Ive removed the cat so it doesnt happen again <a href="../../../g/l/e/User_talk%7EGlen_S_ecf5.html" title="User talk:Glen S"><font color="#535353" style="background:yellow; border: outset #535353 2.5px;">&#160;Glen&#160;</font></a> 11:50, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps the category should be removed from the template to prevent it happening again. Just because someone is asked to change from a non-offensive name does not make them a "temporary Wikipedian" and it seems quite offensive to suggest that anyone with non-Latin characters in their name should be placed in this category and have their user talk page deleted as a result. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 12:07, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

We really don't want some pages to show up in searches. Oh, and again, as I've already noted on my talk page, it's not "userpages that belong to temporary Wikipedians", but rather "Wikipedian pages that are temporary", so there's nothing offensive in it (although I admit it reads ambiguously). <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisza13_4392.html" title="User:Misza13">M</a><a href="../../../m/i/s/User_talk%7EMisza13_b5fd.html" title="User talk:Misza13">isza</a><a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisza13_EA_ae0a.html" title="User:Misza13/EA"><span style="color:green"><b>13</b></span></a> 15:01, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Wow, that cat is huge! I agree that this is not being handled as it should. I know the "no non-Latin names" policy is relatively new; do you know why it was instated like that as it appears to cause some problems?

<li>I don't know why.

<ul>
<li>The no non-latin usernames is <b>not</b> "fairly new". It has been policy for at least a year but I'm not going to go look up the exact date. It is explained in the policy why it is used. See the talk page of the policy for a discussion on what the real issue is now, what will happen when universal login is activated for people with say, usernames with only Japanese characters? Since we don't know the technical details of the implementation, there hasn't been an obvious answer. Now, the "temporary wikipedian" category <b>is</b> fairly new and needs to be removed from the template or reworded at the very least. It is not being used correctly I agree. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 05:33, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>WikiCast is a project to support and asisst the development of 'free' content programming, that could be used for podcast or net radio, beased on wiki content or with a wiki related theme.</p>
<p>A longer term aim is to actually have some kind of stream, but at the moment is on programme production and ideas for programmes.</p>
<p>Given your prominent role in respect of Wikia, and your previous brodcasting experience (with the BBC no less&#160;:-)), your support and gudiance would be much appreicated.</p>
<p>WikiCast also has an IRC channel #WikiCast</p>

<p>Hello, I recently read about the mailing list story on the Wikipedia Signpost, and as the opinionated twit I am I felt the need to chip in my two cents. I don't know where the discussion takes place - I have a feeling I couldn't write your mailing list&#160;;) - so I'm pitching it in on your talk page - I hope you don't mind.</p>
<p>I have to say I think banning men from a mailing list trying to combat sexism is a spectacularily bad idea. The very successful debian-women project has both a majority prescence of men in the channel and on the mailing list, which I think is a good thing. As my English teacher said - "It's much easier to criticize the system if you're on top of it".&#160;;)</p>
<p>You are turning it into a battle of genitals as opposed to values. An attempt like this to polarize the debate as being between men/women as opposed to sane people/sexists or modern people/cultural backwardness will do the cause immeasurable harm, in fact I think the unavoidable overwhelming support by men towards your cause would be invaluable for a woman who feels insecure in contributing or becoming a closer part of the Wikipedia team, as women have said who have been involved in debian-women.</p>
<p>Good luck, and apologees if this is not the correct forum -- <a href="../../../t/o/r/User%7EToresbe_3891.html" title="User:Toresbe">toresbe</a> 06:51, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

As a new contributor to this discussion, having only just read my copy of Signpost, I have to say that most of what I see above, I am in agreement with. The idea of starting a ladies only Wiki is quite wrong, and IMHO, needs to be rapidly addressed by the board. I can understand your views and that you wish to discuss the issue of Gender Bias in editing, but to go and start your own Wiki simply to discuss these problems and to encourage female wikieditors to go do their best concerns me.</p>
<p>Why not use Wikipedia to discuss these problems, and since as the article states, you are using the foundations servers to host the list but not the wiki itself, that seems a bit wrong. Get all the benefit of the foundations servers, but exclude half the community from joining your service? That is to all intent and purpose, exclusionist. Seems to me like you are throwing your toys out of the stroller cause you can't get what you want on here. Just my 2 cents, feel free to fire a broadside if you wish! <a href="../../../t/m/a/User%7ETmalmjursson_5155.html" title="User:Tmalmjursson">Thor Malmjursson</a> 14:38, 12 December 2006 (UTC) <a href="../../../t/m/a/User_talk%7ETmalmjursson_5780.html" title="User talk:Tmalmjursson">Talk to Thorsteinn</a></p>

<dl>
<dd>Then maybe that is something you need to take up with Signpost and tell them to get their facts right. The article states that you are using the foundation's servers to host your mailing list but not the actual wiki. I quote:</dd>

<dd><b>"Wikimedia Foundation Trustee Erik Moeller said, "This is a positive initiative. I have only one issue with it, which is that the mailing list is on Wikimedia's servers, while the wiki is not. While we all trust you, of course, to do the right thing, as a matter of fair play towards others with similar ideas, it might be sensible to either host the list separately, or to move the wiki to Wikimedia's servers."</b></dd>

<dd>I know. I'm just so used to monobook. I've tried the other skins and don't like any with cologneblue being just so-so. Your site was disorienting before I got used to it. Also, I'm surprised you cache it. Looking at recent changes there's not much. Aside from yourself I see a few children scribbling and then some people from Wikipedia Review who tried to tell you that WikiChix is going to be infiltrated by men posing as women and I read that Wikipedia Review thing and they take that seriously there and it's not trolling to them. Your design though is nice looking as a website, just I was viewing it as a wiki: "What version is this? Where's special pages? Where's recent changes/history to see how up to date everything is?" <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnomo_6299.html" title="User:Anomo">Anomo</a> 12:23, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't actually remember why I did it since it was over two years ago. Perhaps it seemed to fit the style guide better which suggest not capitalising page titles.

<p>Hey Angela... I've been an on/off member of Wikipedia for a while and have enjoyed my experience... however, I would like to 'vanish,' as it were... since I have a lot of edits connected with certain topics, mostly in the Hinduism category, I understand my name cannot be entirely deleted... however, since Surya is actually my real name, I'd like this changed... so, instead of LordSuryaofShropshire... I'd prefer LordSimonofShropshire, while, of course, keeping LordSuryaofShropshire off-limits to any other users...</p>

<p>Hello Angela, I just read on the wikisignpost about the girls mailing list. And i have to tell you: As a woman, i feel insulted with the idea that i may need a no-men environment to feel confortable. Its this kind of bright idea that keeps women down, like if we are some kind of threatned species needing protection from predators.</p>
<p>And let me tell you the story about the Frauenbibliotek in the German university I work in: female and male students both pay the same tuition fees but males cannot access to a university venue. Reason for that? Because girls need a sexual-harassment free environment to study. But the funniest thing is that the women responsible for the loans is a lesbian, a buck of the worst kind. But I guess she must be on a contract not to look at the students...</p>
<p>And finally: what if men-wikipedians want a list of their own, to discuss cricket and boobs and chicks in general, free from judgemental opinions of girl-wikipedians? I tell you, if the students in my university wanted a library just for them, they would be lynched by the feminists.</p>
<p>To finish, these kind of idea, although good intentioned i'm sure, in the end just make diferences worse. Men and Women should be equal. Special treatment is, at best, a bad idea. At worse, an insult. Cheers, <a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMuriel_Gottrop_3ed2.html" title="User:Muriel Gottrop">muriel@pt</a> 14:01, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font color="green" face="rage italic">* Correct articles where the term 'gender' is overused, used incorrectly, or used pejoratively to pander to (what Christina Hoff-Sommers, Wendy McElroy and other more moderate feminists call) a "gender-feminist" POV.</font></p>
<ul>
<li><font color="green" face="rage italic">Correct articles where the term "gender" is used (without reference to NPOV dictionaries and other NPOV sources) to replace the term 'sex' as a ploy to pander to "gender"-feminist POV. <b>Correct the usages so that the proper definition is used without regard to</b> UNTESTED and often invalid 'gender theories', so distinctions can be made between 'gender' and 'sex', and so that the usage reflects some sort of NPOV take on a highly loaded term. Just because some widely criticized academic fields have used totalitarian tactics to force 'gender' and censor the usage of 'sex', in US humanities programs is no indication of the validity of this politically-loaded term. Consult NPOV sources such as dictionaries, opponents of "gender"-feminists and NPOV mass media sources to balance 'gender' POV with 'sex' POV.</font></li>
<li><font color="green" face="rage italic">Correct articles where the term 'gender' is being used gynocentrically as a front for 'oppression'-feminist political, legal or cultural power plays. For example, in <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminism.html" title="Feminism">feminism</a> (Status) there is no mention that for the male 'gender', military mortality is 98% compared to 2% for the female 'gender' (in Iraq)...but other forms of far less serious female "gender" oppression are implicated (covertly and most disengenously) as having something to do with the gender "oppression" of women. This kind of blatant, gynocentric "gender" bias is no less POV than the other forms listed here.</font></li>

<p><font color="green" face="rage italic">Said user has further edited the talk page suggesting that (the following quote is taken from the talk page):</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font color="green" face="rage italic">I suspect this project was created to pander to the points of view of <b>misandric, gender-ginning, 'patriarchal oppression' feminists (please see <a href="../../../w/o/m/Women%27s_studies.html" title="Women's studies">Women's studies</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misandry.html" title="Misandry">misandry</a> and <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminism.html" title="Feminism">feminism</a> ) who use the term 'gender' as a cunning, covert, and blatantly gynocentric weapon of war.</b> Many other more moderate feminists and non-feminists have challenged these blatantly gynocentric, and often misandric "gender feminist" ideologies. I insist on a non-sexist, non-'genderist', non-reverse sexist project...otherwise this project is just the usual type of cunning totalitarian tactic we see so much in other politically correct channels. To revert the above content just because none of the orginal authors of this project page like it is a POV stunt to have ones cake and eat it too. I am going to reinsert the content. I insist that before it is reverted again good NPOV reasons be provided. My aim here is some kind of GENUINE non-sexist, non-reverse sexist, and non-'genderist' NPOV...as may be shown well in <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexism.html" title="Sexism">Sexism</a> (drop in editor) 00:37, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="green" face="rage italic">The idea that the term <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gender.html" title="Gender">gender</a> (that is, the idea that at least some of the differences between the roles of men and women in society) is socially constructed, yet 'sex' (i.e. that any differences between men and women are essentially biological), at the very least, looks like misogyny|misoginist]] POV bias of the worst kind.

<p><font color="green" face="rage italic"><font color="black">Thanks Angela for changing that to a redirect. Is there a standard way to request that? Or should I just do it? I know how to do redirects, so is that what should normally be done in cases like this? Originally I was told to request speedy deletes. Then I was told that speedy deletion does not cover that type of cleanup, and to use prod. Now what you say about needing to keep the history (which makes a whole lot of sense to me) sounds like the best idea yet. But the one good thing about prod is that it gives people warning to fix it, talk about it, or whatever. Is there a prod for redirect? Or does the {{<a href="../../../c/o/c/Template%7ECocktail-micro-talk_7ec6.html" title="Template:Cocktail-micro-talk">cocktail-micro-talk</a>}} pretty much do an adequate job of warning. Maybe with just a bit of a wording tweak to indicate it will become a redirect instead of outright deletion? I would really appreciate your input. I want to do this the best way possible, and there will be a lot of these cocktail-related articles coming up for deletion within the next few weeks as our <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Cocktails_Cleanup_2899.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Cocktails/Cleanup">cleanup project</a> winds down.

Adding a request to removing them&#160;? Or asking for election to removing them&#160;? since they don't answer my questions correctly and they even not answer, Also they add the tag for requesting references even in the articles which have just about 4-5 words!

<dd>Hi Angela, the board will soon get an evaluation of the translators by the Allame Tabata'i University in Theran as well as by a second expert. We already have one evaluation that states that the articles are a translation and not an adaptation to fa.wikipedia, not machine translations ... well: the job was translation. When it comes to the layout - that can be fixed in good wiki manner. Well ...

<p>Hey Angela:</p>
<p>I just got finished over at [[WP:CHU}}, and I wanted to drop by and mention two things that popped to mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>When users ask to change username to fix capitalization or other issues where the new username is very similar to the old one, we have to do it for them if they are going to get it; the anti-imposter filter on new accounts will prevent them from creating something similar. For example, if I wanted to become EssJay, I would have to do it by rename, because the username would be blocked from creation by the software.</li>
<li>We have two templates that we use when we close requests: {{<a href="../../../d/o/n/Template%7EDone_f350.html" title="Template:Done">done</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENot_done_e69d.html" title="Template:Not done">not done</a>}}. They used to be only a convenience, but now the archival bot watches for those templates and won't archive a request until it finds one of those templates; we used to have it done based on time, but since requests can often wait several days to be acted on, we found it much easier to have it archived when the completion templates were added. So, if we don't add them when we close a request, it won't get archived until another bureaucrat comes through and adds them. (The clerks don't do that part, for transparency reasons.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Just wanted to point those two things out; glad to see you active over there again! <tt>:)</tt> <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">(<small>Talk</small>)</font></a></span> 10:43, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>How reliable are the dinosaur articles on Wikipedia?

<p>Hello Mrs. Angela. How are you doing? I have begun a discussion on the Image talk:Sarahvulva crop.jpg about the appropriateness of the image. I asked Mr. Jimbo Wales to participate in the discussion because I felt the need for the opinions of the original founders of Wikipedia (I'm guessing he's too busy). I think that there are some radicals who mold the Wikipedia guidelines, designed to be unlimiting to the users in their creativity, for their own purposes.</p>
<p>I'd really appreciate if you'd participate in the discussion, or comment. And if you think that the image is appropriate, could you still read what I have written? I believe they sound pretty convincing. Thank you so much! (<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikimachine_1c21.html" title="User:Wikimachine">Wikimachine</a> 22:09, 13 February 2007 (UTC))</p>

<p>Hi Angela - I'm pretty new to this Wikipedia game and am learning as I go. I hope you can see what I was trying to achieve with that box that you say was really a userbox. It's similar to the blue plaque on buildings where important people once lived: I was trying to put some kind of graphic symbol at the bottom of those subjects that had featured in the works of Monty Python which, although comical, was very intellectual in nature. Is there anything else I can do? I suppose I am simply talking about a 'Mentioned in the works of Monty Python' category of which all relevant articles would be a member. It's not graphical but I suppose it would do. Would that be possible? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnalexwood_c912.html" title="User:Johnalexwood">Johnalexwood</a> 22:16, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wikipedia isn't a random collection of trivia. The mention of Albrecht Dürer in Monty Python isn't relevant in the Albrecht Dürer article. I think you should just stick to the list and not try to spread this over other articles.

<p>Recently I came across info on OpenServing (from <a href="http://www.openserving.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.openserving.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.openserving.com/</a> and <a href="http://www.wikia.com/wiki/Openserving" class="external free" title="http://www.wikia.com/wiki/Openserving" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikia.com/wiki/Openserving</a>) and it seems quite similar to Wikia which also provides facility to create Wiki Format web site on Wikia Servers, so how are they are different, can you pls list the differences. Pls note I have posted a similar query on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Talk%7EWikia_f1a4.html#How_is_OpenServing_different_from_Wikia" title="Talk:Wikia">Wikia Talk Page</a>, so may you would like to reply there. Regards, Vjdchauhan 06:42, 21 February 2007 (UTC).</p>
<dl>
<dd>The differences can't be explained in that article since there are no reliable sources for it yet. I suggest you wait a couple more weeks until Wikia has an official description of it. The 300 openserves launched so far are basically in "stealth mode" while we try this out so there's not much to talk about yet. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 13:26, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your response. Who may know the difference so that the query can be re-directed appropriately (actually I wanted to share this new exciting Wiki thing with my known ones to whom I have already shared about Wikia Services and they will typically ask about the differences between the two so am eager to know more about it). Also no dedicated OpenServing page exists on English Wikipedia. Well below are the ones that I figured out pls check if that's correct and can expanded further:
<ul>
<li>Both Wikia and OpenServing websites will be hosted on Wikia Servers, but will they have common user database&#160;?</li>
<li>Wikia websites have UI similar to Wikipedia but don't have Voting button support.</li>
<li>OpenServing websites is also a Wiki format website but with a different UI and will have Voting button support as well but not sure how the site will look like as I am not aware of any OpenServing website.</li>
<li>Ad revenues from Wikia websites will go to Wikia Inc. Can Wikia Inc share the revenues here as well say between Wikia Inc, web site sysop/admins and another share for say social causes which may be driven by site-admins/City-Wiki-Chapters.</li>
<li>Ad revenues from OpenServing will go to the corresponding sysop/admins.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>An important open question: Can there be a near perfect overlap on Wikia website and OpenServing website e.g. same city websites.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Finally regarding City-Wiki-Chapters (sorry its off topic but wants to put it): Since Wikipedia/Wikia/OpenServing is fostering community formation can it facilitate creation of city chapters of Wikians as well as currently all Wiki communities exists primarily on Internet and have very little physical presence (exception being rare Wikimeetups). If this can be acheived then Wikians can start bringing positive changes to the society physically as well (this is very much needed in countries where social security is somewhat missing and on the otherhand there are resourceful people who can chip in and since Wikipedia is a meeting place for honest people, trust factor will be there as well). With this in place Wikipedians can contribute to society physically as well in both centralized and decentralized way and one can even introduce auditing.</dd>

<p>In the best of worlds all the people translating would be experts on the stuff they translate, but reality will often be slightly different. Regarding the section about you on <a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Board_of_Trustees" class="extiw" title="foundation:Board_of_Trustees">foundation:Board of Trustees</a>, we - the Swedish translators - have some questions and hope you'd like to take your time and help us.</p>
<ul>
<li>In what way is Wikia community-focused? Does it mean its focus is various already existing communities that could use a wiki as some kind of tool, or what? Since Swedish does not really have an equivalent of "community", not in any of the possible senses it is used here, we do need a bit of background to pick adequate wordings.</li>
<li>Business titles are often difficult to translate, since many countries/languages don't share US - or English speaking world? - conventions. <i>Vice President of Community Relations</i>... maybe you could explain in like two sentences what that comes down to? To me, vice presidents is not something you have several of and responsible for a field each - which is what this title sounds like to me. I am clueless, basically. It is very much not my field...</li>
<li>Regarding student assessments. Does it refer to university students, or kids? We have distinctly different words for the two, so we have to pick one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most parts of that page will probably be around for a fairly long time. It can also be expected to eventually be translated to lots of languages. I am convinced translators of different languages will often have the same questions regarding the source texts, so we should probably create some page om Meta where questions from translators and answers to them can be compiled. For now, if you would help us with our terminology struggle I promise to copy it to the relevant place on Meta, once that place is created. // <a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabj_f852.html" title="User:Habj">habj</a> 13:42, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I saw your message on ANNAfoxlover's talk page. Tell me, what do you think should be done with all the autograph books? I'm probably sounding zealous, but I would like to see them deleted. They don't seem to be of any use to Wikipedia. Sure, my own subpages don't help Wikipedia much, but at least they are of <i>some</i> use. Autograph books sound like the sort of thing you have to sign when going into a fancy restaurant to show that you ate there (not a brilliant analogy, but it's reasonable). <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcalamari_163c.html" title="User:Acalamari">Acalamari</a> 01:40, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Perhaps Araks just decided to change their username to ArazZeynili. Araks hasn't edited since September 2006 and ArazZeynili didn't edit before November 2006, so there's no overlap. Either that or ArazZeynili just liked Araks' user page and copied it. Maybe you should ask them if you're concerned about it. 14:25, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
