<p>agreed, the 'controvesy' and 'student organisations' sections are a little biased, but they should NOT be delteted. feel free to edit. as an uninvolved aprty, it is obvious to me that these should remain.</p>

<p>That is a terrible idea. They represent the students at Churchie and remain in those positions for a whole year. Their roles give them the right to be up there.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You made my point for me. They are there for a year, while Wikipedia is to remain timeless. Their role is that of a high school or middle school level student officer. That gives them notability to be included on school publications but absolutely no one has a "right" to be on Wikipedia. I have deleted the student names from this section. They should not be replaced until a full accounting has been given of the notability of the students named Pikachu, Yu-gi-oh, and Zoomer One. On a more serious note, please look at the article on <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stuyvesant.html" title="Stuyvesant">Stuyvesant</a>, which is a featured article. There is no listing of current students elected to student body positions. There are no high quality articles that have this. This is also not a problem. If you feel that their election gives them notability, please keep in mind that even people elected to positions in a city level government aren't considered notable by the standards at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.—<a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWAvegetarian_a804.html" title="User:WAvegetarian">WAvegetarian</a>•<a href="../../../w/a/v/User_talk%7EWAvegetarian_1514.html" title="User talk:WAvegetarian">(talk)</a> 06:57, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hahaha, the funny thing is that you take this so seriously hahaha. Mate, you need to find yourself a girl.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The sad thing is that you fail to understand that Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not a free webhost</a> for you to feel good about yourself. If you want to list the house captains and annually elected student officers you are free to do so on your own bandwidth. Wikipedia is an <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a>. It is the largest encyclopedia in history. It is truly insignificant who was the house captain in any given year. I am removing references to individual non-notable students one more time. If they are replaced I will file a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">request for comment</a> regarding this issue. I am certain that consensus would fall on the side of not including officers' names. Adding them back in would be seen as vandalism and would be a <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html" title="WP:BLOCK">blockable</a> offense as it would be going against consensus. As many people editing this article are probably doing so from school, this would lead to the school being blocked from editing. That would be unfortunate.—<a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWAvegetarian_a804.html" title="User:WAvegetarian">WAvegetarian</a>•<a href="../../../w/a/v/User_talk%7EWAvegetarian_1514.html" title="User talk:WAvegetarian">(talk)</a> 05:29, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>oooooo big man, if u find that sad, then ur a bit sad urself, there are many people our school, and thus many computers at many homes, thousands, ill always win</p>
<dl>
<dd>I advise you pay attention to where you are. This is not a playground; it is an encyclopedia. If you wish to play games that you can "win", I'm sure your grammar school's playground can accommodate you. You and your friends can't "win" here any more than I or the hundreds of thousands of other editors can "win." The community and the end users "win" by having encyclopedic content. We "win" by providing that. Your edits are moving the article further from the goal, thereby losing. Please join our winning team or stop playing games.—<a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWAvegetarian_a804.html" title="User:WAvegetarian">WAvegetarian</a>•<a href="../../../w/a/v/User_talk%7EWAvegetarian_1514.html" title="User talk:WAvegetarian">(talk)</a> 14:53, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hahaha ummmmm hate to tell you big fella but our grammar school doesn't have a playground. you should get your story straight, first you say no one can "win" and then you tell me to join your "winning team", nice one...... ...... ..... ehem ..... ..... anyway its obvious you dont really no wat ur talkin about, oh well, makes it easier for me to WIN. Oh and by the way, I'm not "playing", if you think this is "playing" perhaps you should go to your local playground and partake in your "playing" there.... but thanks for the heads up big fella</p>

<p>I was wondering what the concensus is on including a reference to this nickname for Churchie students is. It is a term that to my knowledge is commonly used amongst Brisbane students and by that measure should be included. If included it certainly should be made clear that the origin is apocraphyl and it's usage degogratry. 194.105.170.60 13:03, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Nah, i dont think you should put zoomers in, its definiatly not for an encycoldidia (or however you spell it) lol</p>
<p>Not mentioning that churchie boys are called zoomers is like not mentioning hitler was a nazi.</p>
<p>the term zoomer comes from an incident that apparently happened when a kid was dared to have sex with the head masters dog and hence did so, and the dogs name was zoomer.</p>

<p>I can understand the comments of the school webmaster on the sexual abuse section and the school not wanting it to appear. On the other hand, it is an important part of history for survivors which should not be ignored. From the perspective of an encyclopaedia, I suspect a paper encyclopedia editor would be more interested in balance than inclusion of relatively small and controversial facts. Why doesn't the perpetrator have a Wikipedia entry??? No doubt all encyclopedia topics have controversial areas. Can they be dealt with in a consistent way? --Blouis79 13:36, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
