<p>I'm gonna be busy for the next couple of days, but I'll happily give this a quick look when I'm back. The one thing I saw within a 30-second glimpse was that your "retrieved on" dates in the references section are ugly-ass American abbreviated forms. My personal preference is a good ol' <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_9.html" title="February 9">February 9</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> - no room for ambiguity or confusion, which the others might provide. Might just be because I'm a stubborn fart... I know it'd take hours, but hell, you asked. I'll get my teeth into it soon enough though. <a href="../../../s/e/e/User%7ESeegoon_a635.html" title="User:Seegoon">Seegoon</a> 18:17, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Could you please CFD Category:Lists of shows by Joss Whedon and Category:Lists of shows by Tim Minear? There are no parent categories named for either of those people and it makes no sense to parent the categories as they concern people and not just their shows. Also, the pages being linked are not lists, but <i>categories</i>, categories for shows.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how to phrase my reasoning and there's no way I can deal with my connection problems and with any input from the creator. I just don't think I can be civil and there's also the issue of whether or not to rename them or delete them.--<a href="../../../r/m/k/User%7ERmky87_07f5.html" title="User:Rmky87">Rmky87</a> 20:59, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was just doing a mate a favour - he doesn't know much about how to gain an FA, but edits articles a lot, and his first nomination didn't go that well. I'm hoping he'll learn how to get an FA etc., so am trying to help out. I wish I could comment as regards Nigel Kneale, though it seems ok to me - beyond citations, my skills are little. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> (as your experience will have shown) are also editors that are rather good in reviewing articles, so you could always politely enquire if they aren't busy, and whether they could have a browse at your article. The more the merrier that comment in my opinion. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a> I found helpful also.</p>
<p>I reckon all your Quatermass related articles could go for FAC - while you go for FAC on one, you could always nominate the other for GA at the same time. I've been tempted to nominate them already, but of course it holds you up in the event of you wanting to get it straight to FA. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuciferMorgan_f0d2.html" title="User:LuciferMorgan">LuciferMorgan</a> 22:04, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Quatermass II, as I've said many times, is definitely ready for FA nomination - when you want to nominate it, just ask those I've named to review the article to properly prepare it. I think you could get the other Quatermass related articles up to GA/FA rather easily - the one I think you might find difficulty on is the character of Quatermass, especially if you've never written an FA on a fictional character. <a href="../../../d/m/o/User%7EDmoon1_9743.html" title="User:Dmoon1">Dmoon1</a>'s FAs on Star Wars characters are rather good templates to use in rewriting a character article. If you end up getting really into getting these Quatermass related articles to GA/FA, you could always try to get them to <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_topics_0e92.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured topics">featured topic</a> standard - now that's a challenge. There's currently only 9 featured topics, but I think you could do it if you were interested. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuciferMorgan_f0d2.html" title="User:LuciferMorgan">LuciferMorgan</a> 22:17, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, Paul. I've given the article a once-over. It looks very good to me — I made a few minor edits, but nothing of substance. (There was some over-linking early in the article — as a rule, I don't think that we need to link common terms like "newspaper" — but that's not a big deal.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>One sentence that could be improved is the reference to the uneven quality of the six parts of <i>Beasts</i>. Since I don't have the original source, I can't clarify it, but it would probably be better to cite a particular critic's opinion than to use the weasel phrase "regarded by some critics". Similary, it would be better to name names for Kneale's double standard about alterations for adaptations rather than saying "it has been observed".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But overall the article looks great — certainly good enough for GA, or you could jump straight to FAC. If it does go on FAC, I'll try to help out with any suggestions the folks there make. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 21:45, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've nominated the article for GA, which should be passed by the time PR runs its course - I hope you didn't mind (withdraw the nomination the moment you nominate the article for FAC if it hasn't passed by then). I thought at the moment you're more concerned in expanding / improving Rudolph Cartier, more specifically the "BBC television" section which needs citations, so thought it could quietly pass GA while you're doing up that one. I know you already have a Gatiss related piece in the article, but is <a href="http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1937220,00.html" class="external text" title="http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1937220,00.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> any good, or have you already used it? <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuciferMorgan_f0d2.html" title="User:LuciferMorgan">LuciferMorgan</a> 05:39, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Despite there not being many sources, I still think Cartier could make GA if you wanted it to - length is never an issue with GA.

<dd>Yeah it looks real good - I rated it B. I don't like giving higher ratings than that - the other I could've given is A, but I think it'd be best if it passed GA first. I nominated Cartier for GA (hope you didn't mind) also, but didn't know where to put him - I put him under "Television" after (you could put Kneale there too if you wanted, but make sure you queue it where it would've been at the time I nominated it). You should make a GA trophy cabinet on your userpage somewhere I reckon - once you got all those GAs you can choose then which can make FA (Q2 and Kneale could sometime). <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuciferMorgan_f0d2.html" title="User:LuciferMorgan">LuciferMorgan</a> 00:02, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for warning me of the dangers of cut and paste - a lesson learnt I hope, though likely not.&#160;:) Definitely go for FAC with Nigel Kneale sometime, and once that successful FAC is over finally get around to getting Quatermass II ready for nomination. They're Doctor Morgan's orders lol - it doesn't really even need much work, it's just sitting there waiting for someone to nominate it. So once the first FAC is over, try another FAC soon after. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuciferMorgan_f0d2.html" title="User:LuciferMorgan">LuciferMorgan</a> 23:26, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Paul. I was wondering if, as Wikipedia's resident <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigel_Kneale_d66a.html" title="Nigel Kneale">Nigel Kneale</a> expert, you might be able to find the time to give <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Stone_Tape_2c79.html" title="The Stone Tape">The Stone Tape</a></i> article the onceover? I've beefed it up and expanded it and I think it might stand a chance of making GA but I'd appreciate if someone knowledgeable could throw their eye over it before I put it up for nomination. Thanks. - <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoe_King_c3f1.html" title="User:Joe King">Joe King</a> 18:54, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Paul, thanks very much for taking a look at the <i>The Stone Tape</i> and thanks very much for your kind words, much appreciated. I'm going to nominate it for GA this evening, so fingers crossed! <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoe_King_c3f1.html" title="User:Joe King">Joe King</a> 18:11, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
