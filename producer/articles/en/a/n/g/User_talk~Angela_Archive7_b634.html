<p>You're obviously one of the <i>de facto</i> elders around here, so I'm coming to you for advice. <a href="../../../m/i/h/User%7EMihaiC_d1f6.html" title="User:MihaiC">User:MihaiC</a> recently added to <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romania_during_World_War_II_30d2.html" title="Romania during World War II">Romania during World War II</a> (I quote verbatim) "Jews in Bukovina and Bessarabia were accused that they supported in an active way the soviet takeover of that teritories." This is undoubtedly a true (if poorly worded) statement, but the lack of agency makes it a slander: they "were accused" by whom? (Answer: well, by the fascists who killed them.) I'd like either to get this statement out of the article or get some serious discussion of any accusations, who made them, what historians have to say about the matter, etc. Frankly, I'd rather just get it out. I don't think every article on the history of WWII needs to deal in passing with a matter like this, although there is doubtless a place to take it up. I'm not sure it would be appropriate just to edit it out. I imagine that is how edit wars generally start. For the moment I am simply leaving it there in it's poorly worded state, hoping that speaks for itself, but that is not a long term solution. I am looking to you for a suggestion on how to proceed. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> 20:01, 13 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm sure you must hate being my source of information, but I trust you to keep up on these things. Do we know who The Fellowhip of the Troll is? Based on the name and a few comments I've seen, I had assumed it was <a href="../../../e/n/t/User%7EEntmootsOfTrolls_3b61.html" title="User:EntmootsOfTrolls">EntmootsOfTrolls</a>, but EOT was hard-banned, I thought. I was just hoping you had heard or discovered something about this--based on the last few days, I think it's obvious TFOTT is not a new user, at the very least, but someone returning, and based on my experience here I usually assume that means a banned user. Anything you know would be helpful, when you can spare the time.

<p>Hi Angela. Just a quick question. First to declare an interest, I have just signed-up as a Brianist via their website <a href="http://www.brianism.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.brianism.org" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> as they seem to have some pretty good ideas. Even so, I do not have a major problem if Brianism is deleted from Wiki since it is arguably too small to belong here.</p>
<p>My question is why you have disputed the factual accuracy of the article? (I think you added the notice, if I'm reading the history correctly.) As far as I can see the article just says what Brianists believe, as stated on their website. If the article represents the website accurately, which seems to be the case, where is the factual inaccuracy? I know Anjouli makes some claims on the talk page which others have disputed, but nobody has disputed the factual accuracy of the article as far as I can see. The issue seems to be simply that the "movement" is too obscure.</p>
<p>I was about to remove the accuracy message, but as a newbie thought it polite to ask first in case I am misunderstanding something. <a href="../../../s/p/e/User%7ESpellBott_96d8.html" title="User:SpellBott">SpellBott</a> 12:58, 14 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_Archive7_b634.html" title="Edit section: Voting on VfD">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Voting on VfD</span></h2>
<p>Hi Angela. I respect virtually 100% of what you do, but I must take slight issue with some recent remarks about counting votes for VfD. This is general by the way, and has nothing to do with the on-going Brianism debate.</p>
<p>Firstly, you have recently suggested that someone's vote should not be counted if they vote "keep" for everything - or at least everything they have voted for recently. Would you put a number on that? For instance, if somebody voted on only 3 things, surely you would not ask for their vote to be discounted simply because all three said 'keep' (or 'delete')? At what number would you do so? 20 votes? 100 votes? How about 100 'keeps' and '5' deletes? An inspection of the history shows that there are many users who have had only 'delete' votes within a given period. Do we discount them also?</p>
<dl>
<dd>No I certainly have not! I did comment on the fact RickK was voting to keep everything, but he was doing it to porve a point. Many people only vote keep. I don't have a problem with that. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Secondly, you have said Reddi's vote at Brianism (which is contrary to mine by the way) should not be counted as he has not given a reason. Very many people (including me!) often vote at VfD without giving a reason. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I see nothing in the Wiki guidelines that says a reason must be given for a vote to be counted, although it is recommended and frequently desirable. Often someone posts a reason and people simply add 'Keep' or 'Delete' beneath it. Probably no bad thing as it saves long arguments being identically repeated over and over. Do we ignore all those votes? Surely not.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Read the guidelines at the top of VfD. It states a reason must be given. The deletion policy confirms this fact. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>I am sure this is done with the best of intentions, but as a major star at Wikipedia I think you have a great responsibility to get it exactly right as many users will follow your lead. My concern is if we start coming up with <b>any</b> reasons to discount votes (other than the recognised one of having made some edits, which is unfortunately needed to keep the sock-puppets out) we are on morally thin ice.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's not actually about votes. I've explained this on the talk page of the deletion policy before, so won't go into it again (it's 6am so you'll have to excuse me for that). <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>People, some of whom may be less ethical than you, are likely to start coming up with reasons of their own for ignoring votes - some perhaps with merit and others just to force the vote the way they want. Voting the same way on everything may be mere caprice - or it may be one user's legitimate way of responding to the fact that he thinks we delete too much - an opinion to which he is entitled, although I disagree with it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This isn't just something I'm doing because I want to. These details are in the deletion policy! It explicitly states that so-called "votes" from users with less than a certain number of edits are to be discounted. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>I strongly believe that we should count <b>all</b> votes, other than those specifically excluded by the existing rules on having made edits. Some of these votes will be unconsidered, capricious or even random - but that is the price of freedom and democracy. As somebody said (may have been on NYPD Blue) "you have to let a few bad guys escape to be sure you don't jail anybody innocent."</p>
<dl>
<dd>I can only state again that it is not about votes, but about obtaining consensus decisions, adhering to policy etc etc. There is talk about reworking the policy to split VfD into a consensus making part and a vote making part, because at the moment there are a lot of people who think VfD should be nothing to do with votes whatsoever. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>If you plan to stick to your guns on this, I would suggest it be discussed in public forum and the guidelines on counting VfD votes changed (or not) once a consensus has been reached. - <i>But how on earth will we count those votes</i>&#160;:)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Please read the talk page and archives of VfD and the deletion policy. This '<b>has</b> been discussed. I am adhering to that policy and resent any implication that I am not. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>I apologise unreservedly if I have given the impression I think you do not adhere to policy. That was never my meaning or intention and I do no think that. Quite the contrary, you are an example to us all on following proper policy. I just wanted to have a friendly discussion about something that concerned me.</p>
<p>There were only two points:</p>
<p>Firstly, someone has been tagging votes with a note saying you said they should not be counted. I accept you were misquoted, as you say. Matter closed.</p>
<p>Secondly, the VfD page says "Explain your reasoning for every page you <i>list</i> here". It does not say "Explain your reasoning for every <i>vote</i> you make here, otherwise it may not be given much consideration." If the second version reflects policy better thant he first, then perhaps it had better be changed to avoid any misunderstanding in future.</p>
<p>I have never questioned that votes from non-editors should not count.</p>
<p>Hope that clears up my meaning and no hard feelings. <a href="../../../a/n/j/User%7EAnjouli_71d8.html" title="User:Anjouli">Anjouli</a> 08:25, 17 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Re <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medical_Scientism_891c.html" title="Medical Scientism">Medical Scientism</a>: It seems to me that this offers an excellent example of the virtues of permanently closing some articles and only re-opening them for editing with the approval of some kind of review panel. As it stands now, the article is unexceptionable (<i>naturellement</i>, since I wrote it&#160;:) ), but as soon as it is unprotected Mr NH will revert it to the absurd rubbish it was before it was edited. Thus, the article will either have to be deleted (and probably Mr NH banned as well), or else permanently protected. The ongoing battles at <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionism.html" title="Zionism">Zionism</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Zionism_3913.html" title="Anti-Zionism">anti-Zionism</a> are less clear-cut, but I think they show the same problem. Some articles will be the subject of revert wars <i>for ever</i> unless they are permanently protected. How is this compatible with the stated Wikipedia objective of creating a <i>complete and accurate</i> encyclopaedia? <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 08:30, 17 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>It's more than a troll fest. It's an absolute nightmare. We really need someone with clout to step in and set the pins up. The poll is getting us nowhere (I didn't set it up, and so LizardKing's sockpuppets are chiming in).

<p>Hi Angela. I have another picture question. The images "Dandelionsmall.jpg" and "Dandelionlarge.jpg" are not dandelion but salsify.

<p>I posted an (increasing less) urgent tech question some 5 hours ago at <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_e980.html#Only_Move-this-page_used_but_history_now_gone" title="Wikipedia:Village pump">Wikipedia:Village pump#Only Move-this-page used but history now gone</a> without sign of response. Could you at least glance at it &amp; recommend who to pose it directly to? Does it call for a developer? (BTW, thanks for the kind intent in not pointing out to me before that i was clueless abt how much could be done w/ "Move this page" w/o a sysop.

<p>I don't understand where the history of the original (i.e., <a href="../../../m/a/s/List_of_people_by_name%7E_Mas-Maz_736a.html" title="List of people by name: Mas-Maz">List of people by name: Mas-Maz</a> prior to today) is, or if lost, how that could happen.

<p>If you're missing my point, i am sure he will as well:</p>
<p>My understanding is that when one user uses "Move this page" to move A to B, and another then uses it to move B to A, the history of A will survive. Am i mistaken? (If so, i am quite satisfied to determine by questioning H. whether there is a better explanation than a server bug, but i discussing with them w/o being more confident that i understand the server specs is pointless and IMO divisive. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerzy_42e0.html" title="User:Jerzy">Jerzy</a> 02:04, 2004 Jan 22 (UTC)</p>
<p>Many tnx, A., that is the hx i was expecting, and i am reassured that anyone can get it, even if i still can't. (I'll check on it again.) I'll also look at Tim's msg; i started kicking myself for looking repeatedly at VP's long content on my slow link a couple or 3 hours ago.

<p>Thanks Angela. As you have no doubt guessed, it's only Jack (Sam Spade), doing his usual best to stir up trouble. He reminds me very much of someone that used to be here and got hard-banned but I can't remember who. RK? DK? Something like that. No matter. He will presumably be banned before too long. Except if he mends his ways, of course, but unless I miss my guess, that will be a cold day in hell. Cheers -- <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a></p>

<p>Angela, I cannot help but fear that some of your recent concerns regarding the arbitration committee are directed primarily at me rather than arising from broader issues of policy. Rather than dance around the point, I'd like to encourage you to join me in discussion of these concerns in a forthright and frank manner. I would welcome your reply here, on my talk page, or via email and would be happy to continue the conversation in any of those places or most any other of your choice.

<p>Angela, I respectfully object to your ban of "UnbannableOne" solely based upon his username. I submit that the only group to which the name "UnbannableOne" is offensive is that of admins who take an active role in banning. If he's causing problems, then fine, but I see nothing wrong inherently wrong with the name. Banning solely on a name that only *suggests* an attitude (without conclusively demonstrating it) sets, IMHO, a poor precendent with respect to Wikipedia's openness. -- <a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESeth_Ilys_3523.html" title="User:Seth Ilys">Seth Ilys</a> 17:46, 26 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

I am tired of him misusing his position as an admin to unfairly present a double standard on CbU. I added duplicate information, and you deleted it. He added duplicate information, and you revert me when I remove it. That is not acceptable. That is misuse of his position, and an acceptance of it by another admin. I never removed a complaint about me, I removed a portion of MY complaint against others un fairly clipped and placed in tannins complaint against me.

<p>There is a double standard on the wikipedia, and a clear hierarchy/clique. Thats normal, to be found everywhere. The problem is that it isn't acknowleged. The egalitarian spirit and anarchist ideals have combined with natural avoidance of stressful circumstances leading to poor rule enforcement for non-vandalism. These problems need solved, and your mediation committe is small, and ill motivated to this task. I am already seeking a name change, and I may have to leave the wikipedia on a rather sour note if harassment is steadilly ignored. Doing something is alot easier than you may think, but it requires a certain amount of effort. Thank you for your politeness, I've never found you otherwise. The problem is that if I am going to stay here I require a minimum of rule enforcement. And if the the wikipedia is going to grow, it needs to make people feel welcomed, not hated and shamed. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 03:42, 28 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Angela - good work on the Village Pump header msg. Slight glitch though in that it's throwing in a couple of blank lines. I went in and tried to remove any blanks, but this doesn't work. I think it's due to all the language codes at the end of the header. Can these be moved? I don't know what impact that will have so I'll leave it to you, but it would be good to remove the blanks. --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyDog_f746.html" title="User:HappyDog">HappyDog</a> 04:23, 1 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes - I still see them. That might have been me editing mediawiki to remove the blank lines, but it didn't work. Looking at the html I get the following code between 'For old discussion, see archive' and the TOC (although it only shows as 5 lines on the screen)</p>

<p>Good morning Angela</p>
<p>I <b>very strongly</b> disagree with what you did at meta. So, I reverted your changes. I do not think it is a good idea to make perfectly reasonable discussions, and wikipedia wide discussion disappear to replace them by discussions made by english people on the english wikipedia for the english wikipedia only. I am perfectly aware of why you did this, but unless we 1)declare that any article touched by a banned user at some point in their activity (even before being banned, and even if touched again by non-banned user) should entirely disappear, and that 2) meta is for english people only, this is not gonna happen. And till I am there, it is unlikely to happen&#160;:-)</p>

<p>Hello Angela,</p>
<p>Thanks for the welcome and the suggestions. I've only been signed on here for about 2 weeks - I'd never heard of wikipedia before but I saw something said about it on another discussion board, and it sounded interesting. And interesting it certainly is.</p>
<p>I've had a look through a lot of links in getting started and have now checked out the ones you mentioned. I noticed you did minor editing on a couple of things I've written which is helpful in learning how to format things correctly, so I appreciate that. As a clueless newbie&#160;:-) I've been flailing a little bit, but that's fine. I'm willing to learn. If you notice me doing anything inappropriate ... please just let me know.</p>

<p>You shouldn't have protected a vandalized version of the Gdansk article. The anonymous user, also known as Gdansk and as Caius2ga, is a known vandal trying to destroy a worked out compromise there. And his edit comments are <i>always</i> misleading. You should rather have blocked him. He was about to be banned some months ago, but left voluntarily. I suggest you unprotect <a href="../../../g/d/a/Gdansk.html" title="Gdansk">Gdansk</a> in an hour or two, so we can revert to the unvandalized version <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENico_e6d8.html" title="User:Nico">Nico</a> 06:44, 3 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>There is no need for mediation. He is a vandal, and no one agrees with him. His edits are an unacceptable violation of the talk page. Anyone else would have reverted his edits. If someone write "Muslims are idiots" on the <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">religion</a> page, you don't need mediation. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENico_e6d8.html" title="User:Nico">Nico</a> 06:52, 3 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>While the Gdansk article was certainly having problems before this edit war, I think protecting it on a version that a) doesn't bold the common alternate/former name Danzig; and which b) mentions before Danzig a largely unknown alternative name in a local language/dialect, is a rather bad idea. I haven't checked User "Gdansk's" edits more carefully than this, but if he is indeed caius2ga, he combines the addition of worthwhile material with a complete unwillingness to discuss issues or compromise with others, and a very strong POV. Sigh, I'm not sure what is to be done, but perhaps we could at least protect on a version that bolds <b>Danzig</b> and mentions the Kashubian name somewhere later (at least that mentions it after mentioning Danzig)... <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> 07:12, 3 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Whichever version I'd protected would have been the wrong one. I just protected whichever one it was on at the time. It is not supposed to express support for that version. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 07:18, Feb 3, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah, I know you weren't intending to express support for that version. But the very fact of protection does, essentially, privilege one version. At any rate, this page was protected for weeks before on a bad version. And now, with caius2ga back, it'll probably stay protected again for weeks on <i>this</i> bad version. Which is rather frustrating. As I said, I'm not sure what is to be done, at this point, given the protection procedure, which I rather wish gave more discretion to sysops to use judgment in determining what version to protect. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> 07:47, 3 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Even Wik and Cautious had accepted that Danzig should be bolded. I think the page now can be unprotected, as caius apparently has left (for today, at least). <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENico_e6d8.html" title="User:Nico">Nico</a> 11:17, 3 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hey, the dispute was not at all about whether Danzig should be bolded. I think about everyone had agreed on that until "user:gdansk" came in. If there'd been an edit war over the things we'd actually been arguing about (what the city should be called in the 19th and early 20th centuries, for instance), I wouldn't really care what version it was protected on. But it's grating for a quasi-trollish contributor to come in and get his version protected. Ah well. Let's see if he stays around. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> 00:37, 4 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>No worry Angel. The editor who added the content, added it both to vegetation succession and <a href="../../../e/c/o/Ecological_succession.html" title="Ecological succession">ecological succession</a>. Since it was not very...convincing...Lexor moved the content from the ecological succession page to its talk page, then came to me to ask if I could have a look. So I reworked the content (I added little actually, but improved the article a bit with the idea). It is only a couple of days later I discovered the same content has been added to vegetation succession. So, the history of this person edit is well in standing in the ecological article. Hope that is clear&#160;:-))) <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthere_36ed.html" title="User:Anthere">fr0069</a></p>

<p>I noticed the article when it was listed on VfD. No consensus was made and the article is left intact. So I put a warning to the article that factuality is disputed and no such name is wellknown in her alledged home land. I certainly did that, but it was wiped out along with its edit history. I will apologize if my expression made anger of you or someone else, but I just tryed to say what the article states are at least disputed. I hope it is a just innocent joke, but it can be used for some deception purposes. "Look! I am great, belive me". And, what I most want to know is that whether it is possible to revert some edit along with its history.

I've started writing a few other pages and if you want to contribute to any of those pages or do some editing that would be great.

I don't appear to be able to edit protected pages (there's no "edit this page" button or other indicator), a little "rollback" does not appear by lists of contributions, and I have no idea how to delete pages.

<p>None of the pages I have edited today contain the VfD stub. Most are pages that I would expect to be pretty permanent (Welcome Newcomers etc.) Are you sure you've got the right user?

<p>I am not linking to the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Wikipedia%7ECommunity_Information_Directory_ecb6.html" title="Wikipedia:Community Information Directory">Wikipedia:Community Information Directory</a> page, but to a boilerplate at Template:Communitypage. I found that there were a lot of similar but different links, and thought this would be a better approach. It doesn't matter if the page is moved or renamed because we can just change the boilerplate, or blank it if we want to lose it completely. --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyDog_f746.html" title="User:HappyDog">HappyDog</a> 00:25, 10 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah - having gone back to my watchlist I do agree.

<p>Hi Angela - We haven't met yet (I'm a newbie) and I apologize if this question has been put in the wrong place (but from what I'm read so far you look fairly competent and active, so I trust you to know what to with it). Well, I sent a test email from within my user account and it took _4_ days to get delivered to my mail box, which is uncommon. EMail header (and message body) shown below:</p>

<p>Your help is requested, since a Sysop of whom you are aware has alas abused his sysop powers.</p>
<p>In summary, the 168.../Lir edit war restarted at <a href="../../../d/n/a/DNA_396c.html" title="DNA">DNA</a>, but this time with the unfortunate twist that 168... has protected the page at his preferred version. (In case you haven't followed this particular saga at all, there was a series of three votes taken about which version of the two opening paragraphs should be used, and a version emerged which has the support of 6 out of the 8 participants. Basically, 168... and Lir insisted on their own versions.)</p>
<p>It is fine for the page to be protected (against Lir), but the "frozen version" should be the one that was agreed to by the community. (If you look at the edits, you will see that many people besides me have reverted back to this near-consensus version.)

<dd>No problem; I started doing it really just so as to work out for myself a philosophy behind what we were deciding in a consistent manner, and it sort of somehow became seemingly worthwhile. Gosh.</dd>

<p>Hi, Angela</p>
<p>I began today's session finding my userpage cleaned up by one Dittaeva. Then I visited a few of the Recent changes pages, and ran into a few comments by Dittaeva. Finally, I settled in to check my own pages before adding new material later. I guess I shouldn't have been surprised to see that Dittaeva had edited my article on the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intertropical_Convergence_Zone_2bdf.html" title="Intertropical Convergence Zone">Intertropical Convergence Zone</a>, and had added a very, very sweet link. Small world.</p>

<p>Angela, I laboured for over an hour and nine minutes to fix VfD after an unnoticed edit conflict. Attempting to be thorough and make sure nobody's work was lost, I posted a header warning people to please check that I'd properly and completely re-added their edits, and you let that stay up for all of <i>fifteen</i> minutes before replacing my notice with an innocuous and sure to be ignored banality.</p>
<p>"Please see the talk page for an edit conflict announcement from orthogonal" doesn't say there had been a conflict, that it was fixed, or ask anyone to check on the fidelity of the fix. For all the reader knows, it's self-evident general annoucement along the lines of "Edit conflicts bad, four legs good."</p>
<p>Text fidelity, as I've mentioned before to you, is something I take somewhat seriously, which is why I went to so much trouble to fix the edit conflict damage in the first place.</p>
<p>I wanted people to see the notice so they'd know that their edits were back, or I'd know from them that I'd missed something. You could easily have waited longer than fifteen minutes, or even replaced my notice with an easily clicked link rather than a text reference few will bother to track down.</p>
<p>I realize Wikipedia is all about editing boldly, but perhaps in the future you could pause a bit longer to consider others' feelings. Thanks. <a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrthogonal_2fa0.html" title="User:Orthogonal">orthogonal</a> 23:07, 16 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
