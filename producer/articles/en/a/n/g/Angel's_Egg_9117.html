<p><i>Angel's Egg</i> follows the daily life of a young girl in a surreal world of darkness and shadows.</p>
<p>The girl, whose name we do not learn, is the keeper of a mysterious egg. She spends her time collecting bottles and artifacts in a gothic, dead city. A man, whose name also remains a mystery, arrives in the dark town one day riding a machine and wearing a cross on his back. The two meet and talk, though their dialogue consists mostly of the single, repeated question "Who are you?".</p>
<p>Meanwhile, shadow fish appear within the town, and then the many statues which line it come alive and begin hunting the fish with spears.</p>
<p>Inside the girl's vast cavernous 'refuge,' which contains many strange fossils and her collection, the man tells the girl a tale similar to <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noah%27s_Ark_8421.html" title="Noah's Ark">Noah's Ark</a>. He waits for the girl to fall asleep and breaks the egg.</p>
<p>The girl reacts in anguish and follows the departing man, only to fall into a ravine of water and die. Her dying exhalation under the water blossoms into bubbles of 'eggs' on the surface. A symbolic ending of apocalypse and rebirth is mixed with a gradual reveal of the story's world which is highly abstract and ambiguous.</p>

<p>Because of the minimal dialog in Angel's Egg, much of the film's intended meaning is portrayed through visuals and symbols. Because of the surreal nature of the film (and no official explanation by its creators), it is open to multiple or even conflicting interpretations, as one can see below. Many or all of the symbols in <i>Angel's Egg</i> can be related to <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">religion</a>, specifically <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>. Mamoru Oshii also directed <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patlabor.html" title="Patlabor">Patlabor</a>, Ghost in the Shell, and myriads of other works that contain Christian themes and references. He claimed to be a Christian himself and trained in seminary for priesthood in his youth, but is rumored to have renounced the religion before working on Angel's Egg.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p><b>Angel Egg</b></p>
<p>In Japan, Angel Egg (<i>tenshi no tamago</i>) refers to a typical <i><a href="../../../t/a/c/Tachigui.html" title="Tachigui">tachigui</a></i> dinner, a stand-and-eat practice Oshii is fond of and he has explored in his 1987 debut live-action feature <i><a href="../../../a/k/a/Akai_Megane_0d5e.html" title="Akai Megane">Akai Megane</a></i>, before developing it as the central theme of his 2006 animation movie <i><a href="../../../t/a/c/Tachiguishi-Retsuden_6d87.html" title="Tachiguishi-Retsuden">Tachiguishi-Retsuden</a></i>.</p>
<p>However, for this film Oshii apparently adapted the idea of an egg to fit the <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2013:1-23;&amp;version=31;" class="external text" title="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2013:1-23;&amp;version=31;" rel="nofollow">parable of the sower and the seed</a>, and other teachings of <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Yeshua-Jesus</a>.</p>
<p><b>The egg</b></p>
<p><i>The Small Egg:</i></p>
<p>(1)1st interpretation: The egg can be seen as symbolizing the young girl's innocence. It is something which she protects and holds on to, but is ultimately stolen.</p>
<p>(2) Another interpretation states that the egg is the "spiritual seed" planted in a human <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soul.html" title="Soul">soul</a> via the <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel.html" title="Gospel">Gospel</a> of <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_Christ_21ac.html" title="Jesus Christ">Jesus Christ</a> - a special kind of <a href="../../../m/e/m/Meme.html" title="Meme">meme</a> which tries to take root in a soul. It is something she protects amidst a dark world, but it is eventually <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=50&amp;chapter=12&amp;verse=24&amp;version=31&amp;context=verse" class="external text" title="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=50&amp;chapter=12&amp;verse=24&amp;version=31&amp;context=verse" rel="nofollow">"reaped"</a> by the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christ.html" title="Christ">Christ</a>-like character- but only after she had journeyed with him and entrusted him alone with it. Eventually, she reaches "spiritual maturity" while passionately pursuing the path of the Christ, and thus bears fruit "many times what was sown", as the parable goes. This was indicated by the production of many eggs from her mouth.(Her spiritual fecundity or "witness") Thus, the small egg represents a "quanta", if you will, of the Gospel that was planted in her soul when she heard or saw something revelatory concerning God's <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salvation.html" title="Salvation">Salvation</a>. The egg was brought to life as a result of being "wooed" by man, and then once it was opened, she charged directly after the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christ.html" title="Christ">Christ</a> on the "narrow path" (Matthew 7:13,14)to spiritual maturity. The metaphor is equivalent to a mature plant producing heads of grain, but Oshii adapted Yeshua's parable to the production of eggs instead, possibly in order to tie in the metaphor of the dove and the ark as expounded below.</p>
<p><i>The Big Eggs on Tree Stalks</i></p>
<p>Near the end of the film, we see organic tree-like structures holding giant eggs with unborn birds inside. These likely represent the spiritual being awaiting the realization of its true form in the afterlife- where each of these <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saints.html" title="Saints">saints</a> are "glorified", attaining <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=47&amp;chapter=22&amp;verse=30&amp;version=31&amp;context=verse" class="external text" title="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=47&amp;chapter=22&amp;verse=30&amp;version=31&amp;context=verse" rel="nofollow">angelic forms</a>(flying birds being symbolic of <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angels.html" title="Angels">Angels</a>), as supported in the very end by: (1)the appearance of the giant eggs after her own had been cultivated by the Christ-figure. (2)the girl's angelic appearance as part of the <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godhead.html" title="Godhead">Godhead</a> (the giant eye-like thing).</p>
<p>The root-like growths holding the eggs were foreshadowed earlier by the Yeshua character as something like "a great tree, sapping the ground to grow and reach up, as if to grasp something...". The tree/egg combination, along with the Christ character's explanation of the tree of life, portrays it to be a symbol of Christianity. He gives the us the sense that it is the final stage of an evolving line of energy, matter, and eventually living things: initially emanating out from pure Spirit(Giant Eye descending), yet over the eons striving to return... to finally "grasp the hand that feeds it". The eggs, we see, were located at the tops of the tree trunks, grasping the unborn chicks. Thus, each of the giant eggs probably represented a human soul which would be preserved through the <a href="../../../l/a/s/Last_Judgment_d203.html" title="Last Judgment">Last Judgment</a>(on the ark of Christ), and so become glorified as part of the <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godhead.html" title="Godhead">Godhead</a>, as we see in the end. In other words, the giant eggs represent the second to last step of the ultimate aim of life, the universe, and everything. The very last step being the glorification or realization of the <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saints.html" title="Saints">saints</a> and assumption to the Godhead, as we saw in the end where the Godhead was populated by the stagnant(eternal) presence of the saints, with our little girl among them.</p>
<p><b>The man</b></p>
<p>The man in <i>Angel's Egg</i> physically portrays a <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christ.html" title="Christ">Christ</a>-like figure. In the beginning he is seen standing on a chess board, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201:18,%206:46;&amp;version=31;" class="external text" title="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201:18,%206:46;&amp;version=31;" rel="nofollow">facing</a> the giant Eye (presumably representing the Godhead, especially <a href="../../../g/o/d/God_the_Father_5aa3.html" title="God the Father">God the Father</a> capacity, since it was sending him out). He arrives in the girls life on a bizarre procession of organic (and phallic!) machines, which most probably represent <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> among others, in reference to <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2011:12;&amp;version=31;" class="external text" title="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2011:12;&amp;version=31;" rel="nofollow">Matthew 11:12</a>.</p>
<p>He carries a cross on his back and wears bandages on his hands, both of which are strongly reminiscent of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> mythos.</p>
<p>(1)1st interpretation: In this particular movie this figure is shown in a clearly negative light, first telling the girl that he would protect her and eventually stealing away from her the egg which she cherishes so lovingly. Following this line of interpretation, some have taken <i>The Angel's Egg</i> to represent Oshi's own fallout with Christianity.</p>
<p>(2)A different interpretation sees the figure in a very positive light: as being her companion and protector in a violent, illusory world, and bringing to fruition what she couldn't have done on her own. He uses the crucifix to do this, in reference to <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2016:24-25;&amp;version=31;" class="external text" title="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2016:24-25;&amp;version=31;" rel="nofollow">Matthew 16:24</a> He actually explains his motives for breaking the egg: Without opening it, one may never realize the potential of whats inside. He overcame her selfish tendency to keep the egg(gospel seed) <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205:14-15;&amp;version=31;" class="external text" title="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205:14-15;&amp;version=31;" rel="nofollow">hidden</a>, by wooing her companionship and trust.</p>
<p><b>The Fishermen and Fish</b></p>
<p>(1)1st interpretation: Fishermen and fish are popular, reoccurring symbols in <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> <a href="../../../m/y/t/Mythology.html" title="Mythology">mythology</a>.</p>
<p>(2)Another interpretation notes that in this particular case, the shifty fish shadows are those of the lobe-finned or <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarcopterygii.html" title="Sarcopterygii">Sarcopterygii</a> genera, which are almost entirely extinct as a group. Thus, the shadows can be interpreted as shades of once-living things, but now dissipating from nature- becoming extinct. To apply the spiritual metaphor, the shadows most likely represent <a href="../../../e/p/h/Ephemeral.html" title="Ephemeral">ephemeral</a> and even <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demonic.html" title="Demonic">demonic</a> forms. It fits well with the concept of demonic illusions, because just as demons are "fallen" <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angels.html" title="Angels">angels</a> (fallen, as in cut off and thus dissipating from God's creation, yet finding some sustenance in the propagation of <a href="../../../i/d/o/Idolatry.html" title="Idolatry">idolatry</a> of humanity. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2012:43-45;&amp;version=31;" class="external text" title="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2012:43-45;&amp;version=31;" rel="nofollow">see Mathew 12:43-45</a>) Supporting this idea, these mirages are zealously pursued by the spearmen, yet never tangibly grasped or attained, and thus no ultimate fulfillment is found. The spears are sharp projections attached to ropes. This most assuredly symbolizes the human <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spirit.html" title="Spirit">spirit</a> projecting itself onto its environment, trying to form soul-attachments and identities in ephemeral things- passions, pleasures, fears, vices, etc. In contrast, the fish enshrined in the Gothic church was colorful and vibrant, and the girl radiated white in its presence. Where the lobed-finned shadows represent shifty goals; ephemeral pursuits; all passing towards extinction... the colorful fish probably represents the <a href="../../../b/o/d/Body_of_Christ_e743.html" title="Body of Christ">Body of Christ</a>- living; thriving; growing; adapting; and steadily surviving...</p>
<p><b>The Water</b></p>
<p>The water is a subtle yet strong underlying <a href="../../../t/y/p/Typology_%28theology%29.html" title="Typology (theology)">Typology (theology)</a> present throughout the film. In the beginning, <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> descends into an "ocean" and the waters emanate out from the impact in waves, signifying the beginning of creation, where <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_Christ_the_Logos_08e8.html" title="Jesus Christ the Logos">Jesus Christ the Logos</a> is sent out to perfect the creation, "glorifying God" by gathering in human souls(in reference to <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=29&amp;chapter=55&amp;verse=11&amp;version=31&amp;context=verse" class="external text" title="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=29&amp;chapter=55&amp;verse=11&amp;version=31&amp;context=verse" rel="nofollow">Isaiah 55:11</a>), as we see in the film. The water most likely symbolizes Spirit, specifically the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Spirit_e4ea.html" title="Holy Spirit">Holy Spirit</a>. Initially the girl collects small amounts of it and stores it away(the best she can do on her own), but in a foreshadowing moment early in the film, she imagines herself to be fully immersed(after which the man shows up). In the end, the water floods everything, and she herself is drowned in it while pursuing the man- symbolizing <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptism_with_the_Holy_Spirit_0efc.html" title="Baptism with the Holy Spirit">Baptism with the Holy Spirit</a> while chasing the path of <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Yeshua</a>.</p>
<p><b>The Ark and the Dove</b></p>
<p>~Ark:</p>
<p>Near the beginning of the film we see the shadow of an ark, which presumably the girl frequented. As the very last twist, we see the ark again at the end- this time slowly panning out. This is yet another example of <a href="../../../t/y/p/Typology_%28theology%29.html" title="Typology (theology)">Typology (theology)</a>, in which the story of the Ark, regardless of its historical details, is taken as a narrative allegory. Oshi no doubt borrowed the idea from the <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistle.html" title="Epistle">epistle</a> of <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%203:20-22;&amp;version=31;" class="external text" title="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%203:20-22;&amp;version=31;" rel="nofollow">1 Peter 3:20-22</a> regarding the moment of salvation, where the ark represents the preservation of the human spirit(will and conscience) amidst a spiritual "flood" or baptism of the rest of the mind, while demonic influences are purged.</p>
<p>As the angle pans out in the last scene, we see a meta-ark, which also probably represents the salvation work of Christ on a larger scale. The entirety of the "remnant" of human souls is preserved through the <a href="../../../l/a/s/Last_Judgment_d203.html" title="Last Judgment">Last Judgment</a> by devoting itself to God through Christ, but not just a remnant of humanity, but also, a reconciliation of the entire universe is implied here. An idea likely inspired by the epistle to the Romans, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%208:18-27;&amp;version=49;" class="external text" title="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%208:18-27;&amp;version=49;" rel="nofollow">Chapter 8:18-27</a>.</p>
<p>~The Dove:</p>
<p>Drawing from the theme of all the 2nd interpretations above- While the ark represents Christ preserving the remnant of human souls (and the universe reconciled through them in a mysterious fashion- Romans 8:18-27)), the dove must represent the souls of humanity in general, sent out by God into human bodies, but in the process using free will to alienate themselves from "Him" by chasing after <a href="../../../i/d/o/Idols.html" title="Idols">idols</a>. According to what is implied in this film, this severs a person's connection from <a href="../../../e/t/e/Eternal_Life_1f9e.html" title="Eternal Life">Eternal Life</a> in God. (the birds forgetting the ark and Noah, becoming fossilized). In the largest dialog section, the Yeshua character presents a variation of Genesis 8, in which the bird forgot where it came from, and probably died in the waters somewhere. He then makes an equivalence between the forgetful bird and humanity(including himself, as "the son of man"). Shortly afterwards, they find the bird dead amongst the fossils, which symbolizes concepts found in <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians%202:1-3;&amp;version=31;" class="external text" title="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians%202:1-3;&amp;version=31;" rel="nofollow">Ephesians 2:1-3</a> i.e. "spiritual death" because of relational estrangement from God. This idea is supported further when the girl declares to have the bird alive and growing in the egg, which the Yeshua character treats with some skepticism because, as we see later, it was only a half-truth that she had the bird. Since the egg was the seed of the knowledge of salvation planted in her, it only became the bird <b>after</b> it was brought to fruition by Christ. Thus, the bird represents the human spirit initially created by God<i>(dove sent out from ark)</i>, fallen in <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sin.html" title="Sin">sin</a><i>(bird forgets God and fossilizes)</i>,but then reconciled again to God through the Son<i>(he uses the crucifix to reap what is sown, and the giant tree/eggs emerge)</i></p>
<p><b>Misc.</b> The girl, of course, represents a spiritually immature person- possibly also an actual child, since in the end she appears as part of the Godhead in a child-like form rather than in an adult form. She holds the egg in a way which looks like she's pregnant, which follows with the analogies above in which the gospel seed grows inside of a person, taking root in their soul, eventually "birthing" fruit, several times what was sown.<i>(Mathew 13:23)</i></p>
<p>While there may be a few more allegories to draw from the film, we have provided tentative interpretations of the main themes above. It is interesting to note that the deeper nature of the film has eluded the usual anime fan-base since its release. Due to the exceedingly esoteric nature of the spiritual allegories presented, having them explained by someone familiar with Christian theology still puts the viewer in a difficult position.</p>

<p>This was a 1987 <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian.html" title="Australian">Australian</a> <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction.html" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a> movie which alternates between live action footage directed by <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Colpaert_643d.html" title="Carl Colpaert">Carl Colpaert</a>, describing a small group of people travelling through a post-apocalyptic world, and sequences from <i>Angel's Egg</i> dubbed into English. The dialogue during the dubbed scenes is much expanded, and deviates strongly from the original Japanese script - for example the man and girl are clearly stated as being siblings, while originally they appeared to be strangers.
