	    <p>1, 2 and 4 are very good reasons to leave in my opinion. I'm not that strongly against fair use -- shouldn't articles about political parties contain their logos? 5 is not a problem at all -- let all people write about what they want to, as long as it meets our notability criteria. We should work on getting more people to write about historical and geographical articles, though, yes. —<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightstallion_a8d9.html" title="User:Nightstallion"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Nightst</span></a><a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightstallion_esperanza_7d46.html" title="User:Nightstallion/esperanza"><font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">a</span></font></a><a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightstallion_a8d9.html" title="User:Nightstallion"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">llion</span></a> <a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENightstallion_e2b1.html" title="User talk:Nightstallion"><i>(?)</i></a> 11:22, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, articles about political parties shouldn't contain their logos. The logos don't provide any essential information about the political party, so there's no reason to violate copyright like that. The "no fair use" policy is just about the only thing I like about de-wiki. I think my biggest problem with the fanboy articles is that they are predominantly <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, yet they are so well established that they will never be deleted on those grounds. Descriptions of fictional characters' personalities and behavior are based entirely on what the editor himself has observed, not on published sources. I'll add this to the page. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 11:41, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think we'll have to agree to disagree on fair use (though I agree that it's regularily overused in its extent). I concur with the OR problem of fancrufty articles, but would see no problems if they were cited; there's lots of websites about comics on the web which could be cited, I believe. —<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightstallion_a8d9.html" title="User:Nightstallion"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Nightst</span></a><a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightstallion_esperanza_7d46.html" title="User:Nightstallion/esperanza"><font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">a</span></font></a><a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightstallion_a8d9.html" title="User:Nightstallion"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">llion</span></a> <a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENightstallion_e2b1.html" title="User talk:Nightstallion"><i>(?)</i></a> 11:53, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well I'm not saying there should be no articles at all on comic strips and the like, just that there don't need to be articles on every single character and every single place -- or even "lists of minor characters" and the like. If verifiability were strictly applied, I think 90% of the fanboy content would disappear, but I seriously doubt verifiability ever will be strictly applied to these articles. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 11:57, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>Well, to talk about the next few points you raised... I couldn't agree more with #6, of course. What's fucking wrong with "ß"? I wouldn't quite go as far with #7, as there are a number of rather notable schools (in Austria alone, there are at least one or two dozen notable schools, either for their age or for other interesting historical details), but yes, there's definitely too many articles about them. I wouldn't be opposed to having many articles about trivial things in principle, but there's just so much more which hasn't got any articles or badly written ones... Ah well. Regarding #8, I was rather surprised about that, as well... I naturally also agree with #9; who wouldn't? And #10 is one of the lowest points in Wikipedia's recent history, I believe, both for the AGF as well as the censorship issues raised by this. —<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightstallion_a8d9.html" title="User:Nightstallion"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Nightst</span></a><a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightstallion_esperanza_7d46.html" title="User:Nightstallion/esperanza"><font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">a</span></font></a><a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightstallion_a8d9.html" title="User:Nightstallion"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">llion</span></a> <a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENightstallion_e2b1.html" title="User talk:Nightstallion"><i>(?)</i></a> 12:17, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmm, I was actually going to ask Angr about #6 when I found this lively month-old discussion here. It was always my understanding that we are supposed to <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28use_English%29_65c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English)">use English</a>, and that since the alphabet of the English language consists of only&#160;26 letters, all those funny foreign letters are supposed to be substituted (with established dictionary words such as "café" being obvious exceptions). Russian, for example, is <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanization_of_Russian_dc27.html" title="Romanization of Russian">romanized</a>, so, I figured, is the case with other languages whose alphabets are either non-Roman or heavily utilize diacritics. From what I see in #6, Angr disagrees, but there is no explanation of why. Surely, a policy you just don't like isn't a good enough reason for leaving, especially when it seems to be broken <a href="../../../s/k/a/Skagafj%C3%B6r%C3%B0ur_Municipality_e70a.html" title="Skagafjörður Municipality">left</a>, <a href="../../../j/%C3%A4/r/J%C3%A4rvenp%C3%A4%C3%A4.html" title="Järvenpää">right</a>, and <a href="../../../c/h/%C3%A2/Ch%C3%A2tillon%2C_Hauts-de-Seine_5b10.html" title="Châtillon, Hauts-de-Seine">in the middle</a>?</dd>
<dd>I hope Angr wasn't bombarded with the variations of this same question in the past to the point where he doesn't want to chew on this subject a minute longer, so if there is a link to previous discussion, I'll take it and shut up&#160;:) At this point, I am merely curious.

<dd>"Use English" means don't write your articles in any other language. It means use English names as the titles of articles where they exist (<a href="../../../v/i/e/Vienna.html" title="Vienna">Vienna</a>, not "Wien", etc.). It doesn't mean stick to the 26 letters of the English alphabet when writing about topics that don't have English names. Sticking to the Latin alphabet is a good idea, but the Latin alphabet <i>includes</i> letters like ß, ð, þ, and letters with diacritics. I <i>do</i> like the policy as it stands; what I dislike is (deliberate?) misinterpretation of that policy resulting in misspelled article titles. To me, having the article on Meißen at <a href="../../../m/e/i/Meissen.html" title="Meissen">Meissen</a> is simply misinformation: we're telling the readers something that isn't true. It's as bad as having the article on <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mississippi.html" title="Mississippi">Mississippi</a> at "Missisippi" instead on the grounds that <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=missisippi" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=missisippi" rel="nofollow">it gets a large number of Google hits</a>. As an encyclopedia, we're supposed to be combatting ignorance, not propagating it. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> 21:49, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>True, but isn't "ss" an accepted way to represent "ß"? "Ue" to represent "ü"? And so on? After all, by your logic there is no place called "Moscow", there is "Москва", and only that. I guess I just don't see <i>how</i> you draw a line between what's acceptable and what's not. I realize that it's probably the type of script (Latin/extended Latin is allowed, but other scripts are not), but surely there was a reason why the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Board_on_Geographic_Names_d84c.html" title="United States Board on Geographic Names">BGN</a>/PCGN co-developed a whole set of Roman-script spelling conventions for languages such as Faroese, Icelandic, and yes, German, and why these conventions are being largerly followed in academic circles? Conventions aside, why not propose clarifying the policy by including a description of the letter set that would be allowed in the article titles instead of just venting under item&#160;#6 on a subpage not many are likely to see?—<a href="../../../e/z/h/User%7EEzhiki_e732.html" title="User:Ezhiki">Ëzhiki (Igels Hérissonovich Ïzhakoff-Amursky)</a>&#160;•&#160;(<a href="../../../e/z/h/User_talk%7EEzhiki_95fa.html" title="User talk:Ezhiki">yo?</a>); 22:13, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"ss" is only an acceptable replacement for "ß" (1) in Switzerland and (2) where "ß" is typographically unavailable, such as when writing in all uppercase letters. The two do contrast with each other: <i>Masse</i> and <i>Maße</i> are different words in German and are pronounced differently. My logic does <i>not</i> say there is no place called "Moscow", only "Москва", because Moscow is the English name for Москва -- although perhaps my logic <i>does</i> say there is no place called <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blagoveshchensk.html" title="Blagoveshchensk">Blagoveshchensk</a>, only "Благовещенск", since Благовещенск doesn't have an English name. Nevertheless, the policy says to transliterate non-Latin-alphabet names into the Latin alphabet, and it says that Latin-alphabet names that have no English equivalent should be left alone. There's no point in my attempting to get policy clear on this issue, though; it's just far too contentious and consensus could never be reached. Every straw poll I've seen on the issue has always wound up split about 50-50, with lots of harsh words and ill feelings all around. I'm sick of articles with misspelled names (per point 6), but I'm <i>also</i> sick of all the fighting about the issue. So instead, I vent on a little subpage of my user page that I don't expect very many people to see. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> 05:49, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>Well, I don't seem to be going anywhere at the moment! My personal opinion is that encyclopedia articles should only be about things that exist in the real world. Computer games exist in the real world, therefore they are valid topics for encyclopedia articles. But characters and places <i>in</i> computer games do not exist in the real world, therefore they (in my opinion, not per WP policy) should <i>not</i> be the topics of articles. The same holds true of books and book series: <i><a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_5aec.html" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a></i> and each of the books/movies should have an article, but <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_%28character%29_66bc.html" title="Harry Potter (character)">Harry Potter (character)</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/g/Hogwarts.html" title="Hogwarts">Hogwarts</a> shouldn't be. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 07:33, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Glad to hear you aren't leaving anytime soon.&#160;:) I actually agree with you: <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lakitu.html" title="Lakitu">Lakitu</a> (blargh) is up for FA review; I actually recommended it be removed not only as a FA, but also as an article, since the existence of multiple published and reliable secondary sources is the most general litmus test for the inclusion of articles. I think one of my new goals is to help clean up articles at the computer and video games WikiProject (merges, redirects, removing fair use images, AfD, and so on). Just the other day I immediately removed a massive image gallery from <i><a href="../../../t/w/i/The_Legend_of_Zelda%7E_Twilight_Princess_d1f5.html" title="The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a></i>. Before the removal there was vague discussion on the talk page as to whether the gallery was "too big:" the response was that the images should stay because they are "beautiful." What part of official policy (FUC) do the majority of editors not understand? <i>EDIT: Do you have any recommendations as to how CVG articles should be structured?

<dd>There are guidelines for writing about fiction, but the computer and video game space is rather prone to the attention of enthusiastic fans, which make enforcing policy a quite daunting task.

<dd>I'm not sure there's anything particularly <i>wrong</i> with the current format; I was just hoping to gain perspective as to what could be a more "encyclopedic" format (I can't base format off of written encyclopedias as they don't cover popular culture). It's unfortunate, because I usually like operating within as strict guidelines as possible. In general, structure of CVG articles follows that of books and movies, gameplay section excepted, so perhaps the format is just fine after all. --<a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETristam_8892.html" title="User:Tristam">Tristam</a> 00:16, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Angr, I tend to agree with you on the whole about schools, it is tedious seeing endless articles about mediocre high schools or comprehensives. Having said that there are other notable schools apart from <a href="../../../e/t/o/Eton.html" title="Eton">Eton</a>, such as <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kings_School_Canterbury_9b1d.html" title="Kings School Canterbury">Kings School Canterbury</a> founded by <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Augustine_8634.html" title="St Augustine">St Augustine</a> in AD <a href="../../../5/9/7/597.html" title="597">597</a> - if only by virtue of being the oldest extant school in the world. If you allow Eton, then why not <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harrow_School_01a8.html" title="Harrow School">Harrow School</a>, whose famous alumnae include <a href="../../../c/h/u/Churchill.html" title="Churchill">Churchill</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/h/Nehru.html" title="Nehru">Nehru</a>. It is is to Eton as <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_University_9d97.html" title="Oxford University">Oxford University</a> is to Cambridge. Then to be partisan, one ought to include <a href="../../../a/m/p/Ampleforth_College_20d9.html" title="Ampleforth College">Ampleforth College</a>, known as the Catholic Eton. <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Paul%27s_School_4268.html" title="St Paul's School">St Paul's School</a> has the highest admission rate to <a href="../../../o/x/b/Oxbridge.html" title="Oxbridge">Oxbridge</a> in Britain (60% in 2005) and therefore more academically distinguished than Eton... and so on. People will only look up the schools they are interested in, or have attended themselves. I guess that is the democracy that is Wikipedia. I don't have to look at low brow articles unless I want to. I find the quality of writing on serious subjects at Wikipedia is of a high standard and also less prone to vandalism.(not being frequented by puerile high school morons).

<dd>I allow Eton because it's the only school I've ever heard of without actually having attended or visited myself. The other schools you mention I've never heard of.
