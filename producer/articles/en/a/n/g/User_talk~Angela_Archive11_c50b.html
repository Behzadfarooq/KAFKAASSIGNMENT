<p>Hi Angela. It was nice meeting you in Paris. I hope you make a safe trip back to England. As i told you, I am working on a book about wikis. So, if you can provide me with contacts of wiki users, especially in but not limited to the corporate world, that would be really helpful. Thanks again, and see you soon&#160;! <a href="../../../../fr/a/l/l/Utilisateur%7EAllyGator_28b9.html" class="extiw" title="fr:Utilisateur:AllyGator">AllyGator</a></p>

<p>Angela,</p>
<p>Sometime please have a look at <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedians_by_religion" class="extiw" title="m:List_of_Wikipedians_by_religion">WikiPedians by Religion</a>. In common with most Anglicans, the Church of England statutes and official the Church of England website [<a href="http://www.cofe.anglican.org/about/frame_means.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cofe.anglican.org/about/frame_means.html" rel="nofollow">What it means to be an Anglican</a>] I believe the Anglican church to be a Catholic Church upholding the Catholic faith. I have convinced a succession of Roman Catholic (who are 20 time more common at WikiPedia than Anglicans) to try to get what "Catholic" means to 70 million Anglicans included at en but each one goes off and another arrives. Now on Meta they keep listing me as a Protestant which I object to rather strongly. Am I not free to say what my religion is? --<a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a><a href="../../../b/o/z/User_talk%7EBozMo_4fce.html" title="User talk:BozMo">|talk</a> 10:04, 6 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Angela, Actually I did not ask for your opinion on the nature of the CoE. I asked you to do what a proper arbitrator should do: look at the facts and then decide. I have said that the CofE declares itself in statute and on website to be Catholic. I also as a practicising Anglican believe it to be Catholic. What I would like you to do (if your opinion) or obtain (if someone else's) is say why we should describe the CofE as Protestant. I know that every Roman Catholic document ever written says it was Protestant &amp; founded by Henry VIII but everything it writes about itself says the opposite (and founded by Elizabeth I). I know it welcomes protestants and is in communion with some protestant as well as Catholic Churches but that isn't the same as being Protestant. --<a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a><a href="../../../b/o/z/User_talk%7EBozMo_4fce.html" title="User talk:BozMo">|talk</a> 13:19, 6 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay, I am happy to ask BCorr and have left him a message. However, if you aren't happy to get involved or read the reply I posted to Toby Bartels could you reverse your own change to the list in favour of my neutral one (Anglicans listed as neither Protestant nor Catholic) until he has reached a conclusion. As I said I don't have much hope in a general NPOV position on Catholicism but I think this particular request isn't unreasonable.

<p>A few days ago, AndyL listed a request on the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_mediation_71be.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for mediation">Wikipedia:Requests for mediation</a> page between User:WHEELER and himself:</p>

<p>After discussing the matter with <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESannse_0094.html" title="User:Sannse">sannse</a>, it seems that the first step is to identify one or more members of the committee who are willing to mediate in this case, although before proceeding it will be necessary to clarify the goals of the mediation.</p>
<p>And just FYI, there has also been quite a bit of chatter on the WikiEN mailing list about similar issues.</p>
<p>If you are willing to act as the mediator in this case, please leave a brief note stating so at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_mediation_71be.html#User:AndyL_and_User:WHEELER" title="Wikipedia:Requests for mediation">Wikipedia:Requests_for_mediation#User:AndyL_and_User:WHEELER</a>.

<p>I noticed you removed what may be considered criticism of you and other trustees from <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/What_we_use_the_money_for" class="extiw" title="m:What_we_use_the_money_for">m:What we use the money for</a>. HC</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's not criticism. It was a non-factual statement. A</dd>
</dl>
<p>Since that page was protected, I feel that may have been questionable use of your admin powers on meta. HC</p>
<dl>
<dd>Firstly, I want to say that at the time I made the edit I didn't notice the page was even protected. I noticed it afterwards but saw from the talk page that it was only protected against vandalism, not from normal edits, so I didn't think there was any issue.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly, I disagree that this was in any way an abuse of power. It wasn't protected as the result of an edit war, but because it was a high-visibility target, like the <a href="../../../index.html" title="Main Page">Main Page</a>. Is the editing of that by admins regarded an abuse of power? No, it's not - protection from vandalism and non-trusted edits are is very different from protection due to a dispute. Also, meta has a different protection policy than the English Wikipedia. Many pages are protected over there simply because there are far fewer admins, so there is less chance vandals can be easily reverted or blocked. Pre-emptive protection is far more common, and editing of these pages by any admins is not unusual. We even give out temporary adminships very liberally for the specific purpose of allowing users to edit specific protected pages. All the financial pages, for example, remain protected, and during the elections Danny and Imran were given partial adminship so they could protect and edit the pages about the elections. A</dd>
</dl>
<p>Furthermore, you never discussed the change on the talk page. HC</p>
<dl>
<dd>I didn't think it needed discussing. I have nothing more to say that what I said in my edit summary. The statement that we use donations to send people to France is blatantly untrue and misleading. A</dd>
</dl>
<p>Please consider reverting your removal of my comments, and discussing the matter on the talk page with the community before acting.

<dd>Dear HCheney -- you have made a very strong allegation here -- basically claimimg that a Wikimedia board member has abused her administrative powers by removing criticism of her from a protected page. The short answer (which you absolutely should have investigated before adding to a page that is linked to from <i>every single en:Wikipedia page</i>!) is that the money was <i>not</i> used for that, so this was simply a factual change, and if you look at the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/meta:Protection_log" class="extiw" title="m:meta:Protection_log">m:meta:Protection log</a> you'll see that it was protected because of vandalism. A number of individuals made earmarked contributions which covered the travel cost, including me (I gave $15.00 out of my own pocket) -- in fact, the total donations made were almost the exact amount of Angela's train fare, and she paid for her own accommodations. <a href="../../../b/c/o/User%7EBcorr_b5f0.html" title="User:Bcorr">BCorr</a><font color="chartreuse">|</font><a href="../../../b/c/o/User_talk%7EBcorr_d88c.html" title="User talk:Bcorr">Брайен</a> 20:06, 13 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As an objective 3rd party I can't help think that one of the most important things about wiki is to introduce the website to others and to widen the sphere of users through intergrating our systems with that of other countries. If this should mean that somebody, nah, someone from the board of trusties for instance, should travel elsewhere in order to do this, surely the cost is justifiable in the spirit of the site. The cost these days of travelling somewhere such as France is insignificant when compared to the number of hours some people spend contributing to the venture that is wikipedia and no doubt the invaluable public relations obtained while on wiki business. This website is not simply about people writing and editing articles - surely it is about enabling a free source of invaluable knowledge to those who yearn to access it - if, in the tireless efforts of some, this incurs a minor cost (note the point about Angela self funding some of it) then surely this is a small price to pay for the benefits of supporting and intergrating with other wiki users europe (or world) wide and no doubt widening the wiki world, thus increasing the encyclipedic capabilities of the site - is that such a bad thing?? <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHelenmarie_9cf7.html" title="User:Helenmarie">Helen</a><a href="../../../h/e/l/User_talk%7EHelen_4c61.html" title="User talk:Helen">.</a> 21:23, 13 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are three subjects being discussed: your adminship actions, my comment, and our fundamental disagreement in Wikimedia policy. The latter is irrelevant, we can agree to disagree on policy issues. You have claimed that Meta has different adminship and protection policies then en:. I looked for this policy, but all I could find was <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Administrator" class="extiw" title="m:Administrator">m:Administrator</a>, which directed me to en's Administrator policies. Where does it state, directly or indirectly, that Meta admins are permitted to fundementally change the content of protected pages without discussion? --<a href="../../../h/c/h/User%7EHcheney_daf0.html" title="User:Hcheney">H.</a> <a href="../../../h/c/h/User_talk%7EHcheney_7a8d.html" title="User talk:Hcheney">C<small>HENEY</small></a> 01:29, 14 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What Wikimedia policy? There are no policies yet, so I fail to see how you can think we would disagree on them. Regarding protected page policy on meta, this is implied by the text on <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Meta:Requests_for_adminship" class="extiw" title="m:Meta:Requests_for_adminship">m:Meta:Requests for adminship</a> which explains how adminship is given out for anyone needing to work on protected pages - which shows that a page being protected is not meant as something to stop non-vandals working on it. That page also explains the policy for gaining adminship there. The policy doesn't need to say that admins are allowed to change the pages. The lack of a policy stating the opposite and the fact we give out adminship purely so people can edit protected pages implies that editing of them is, of course, allowed. As for your implication that I fundamentally changed the content of that page - I disagree; I removed one factually wrong sentence. I have explained why it was wrong and you have not suggested any reason it should have stayed there. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 01:40, 14 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As for the sentence being factually wrong, I have already addressed that above. However, I do not feel as so strongly to insist on its inclusion. However, even if from your own point of view you <i>feel</i> the sentence was factually wrong, I believe you were the wrong admin to remove the sentence. Would you be willing to agree not to remove other user's criticism (factual or disputed) of you from protected pages, and instead requesting another admin to remove it to avoid a conflict of interest? If you can agree, I would consider this matter done and over with. --<a href="../../../h/c/h/User%7EHcheney_daf0.html" title="User:Hcheney">H.</a> <a href="../../../h/c/h/User_talk%7EHcheney_7a8d.html" title="User talk:Hcheney">C<small>HENEY</small></a> 01:59, 14 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, Angela</p>
<p>As you know, requesting copyright-free images from musea or institutions isn't easy. As I'm working on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Gastropods_0d68.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Gastropods">Wikipedia:WikiProject Gastropods</a> and I'm writing biographies of famous malacologists, I send often emails to such musea, using the boilerplate text: request for an image. Most of the time I don't even get an answer, which makes me think there must be something wrong with the boilerplate text, such as not stressing the growing importance of Wikipedia, Wikipedia being used as a reference etc. On the other hand, requesting a picture from the Te Papa Museum, Wellington, New Zealand , I got this answer&#160;:</p>
<p><i>Thank you for your email.</i></p>
<p><i>We have had a discussion at this end and we certainly see Wikipedia as a very interesting project.</i></p>
<p><i>Unfortunately the terms of supply required by Wikipedia contravene Te Papa's terms and conditions as they currently stand:</i> <a href="http://www.tepapa.govt.nz/Images/TermsConditions.asp?language=english." class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tepapa.govt.nz/Images/TermsConditions.asp?language=english." rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>
<p><i>Te Papa considers every image request on a case-by-case basis. This is to ensure that image use is in line with the principles of Te Papa. While we would be happy to supply images for use in your article we do not want to lose control of any further use of these images.</i> <i>If you can see anyway around this problem I would certainly we open to any suggestions you may have.</i></p>
<p><i>Best wishes</i></p>
<p>I wonder if we can get around this problem. They don't want to lose control over their images. I think I know of a solution, but I don't know if it is within the GNU License.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are on the Internet patches to invalidate the right mouse-button. Downloading becomes impossible, but you can still print the page</li>
<li>In Dreamweaver they use snippets, little programs that you can use as you wish. In this case, I would propose that the image, on mouse-over or left-clicking, comes up as a pop-up (which, again so, cannot be downloaded). But I do not know if this is possible within Wikipedia. Perhaps work for a programmer&#160;?</li>
</ul>
<p>This way, the copyright holder would still remain in control of the image. But is this still within GNU Free Documentation License&#160;? <a href="../../../j/o/j/User%7EJoJan_2b10.html" title="User:JoJan">JoJan</a> 16:04, 16 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you. I want to say that I would make the same think as you did: As bureaucrat, I would give him sysop because he asked for this and I was the only admin on sr:... I didn't know that he had wanted to do that. (And some of people thought that I did that...) I think we would have more admins and bureaucrats very soon. <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">Nikola Smolenski (in Serbian Никола Смоленски)</a> is active on Wikipedia for a log time, but he didn't want to ask for permissions. Now, it is more easy because all of our basic needs can be written in Serbian. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillosh_e5be.html" title="User:Millosh">Millosh</a> 17:50, 17 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

I want to give him admin permissions, but after one month. He is working (except his very restrictive behavior) good. As I don't think that he would pass now, I think I would give to him permissions in a month. I hope that he would not be so restrictive then, but...

<p>Hello. I've noticed that things like VfD, Speedy Deletion and Stub are now categories, which seems a good idea. But does this mean that adding to the category is enough action?

<p>Even this page doesn't have enough sense (Latin namespace, Cyrillic text), we have (not only in this moment; in general, it is Serbian political problem) discussion about use of Latin alphabet. In this moment Serbs use 50:50 Cyrillic and Latin alphabet. One place (anywhere: on Internet or in real life) is Cyrillic or Latin only because at that place in that moment there are more pro-Cyrillic or pro-Latin people. I am using Cyrillic alphabet, but I know that Serbian Wikipedia has to have it's Latin pages. And the most of people in Serbia think like me or analogue (they use Latin, but they relise that Cyrillic alphabet is also important). But, the most active people in that field are those who want only Cyrillic or only Latin alphabet. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillosh_e5be.html" title="User:Millosh">Millosh</a> 15:10, 20 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>And about your name in Serbian. Transliteration of your name is Ангела. Literar transcription is Ејнџела. But, we have your name in Serbian and it is Анђела /and<sup>j</sup>ela/.

<p>Also, Avala promised that he would not be so restrictive in the future. He is working well. (I told to him to translate pages from Meta about resolving conflicts and I think he learned how to use his "power".) I want to give back to Avala admin permissions. I just need to talk with other bureaucrat, <a href="../../../../sr/%D0%BD/%D0%B8/%D0%BA/%D0%9A%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%7E%D0%9D%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B0_%D0%A1%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8_7576.html" class="extiw" title="sr:Корисник:Никола_Смоленски">Nikola Smolenski</a> about that. We would have four admins/bureaucrats and I think that there is no danger anymore.

<p>I think that I've created something that may be controversial: <b>substubs</b>. I saw a reference to it on <a href="../../../f/i/n/Wikipedia%7EFind_or_fix_a_stub_e7c5.html" title="Wikipedia:Find or fix a stub">Wikipedia:Find or fix a stub</a>, so I decided to make its existence official. The page I created is <a href="../../../s/u/b/Wikipedia%7ESubstub_c0ec.html" title="Wikipedia:Substub">Wikipedia:substub</a>, and the boilerplate message that I created is Template:substub. The whole idea is that a <i>sub</i>stub is even smaller than a normal stub, and must be treated accordingly. I was just wondering what you thought of the idea (but please read <a href="../../../s/u/b/Wikipedia%7ESubstub_c0ec.html" title="Wikipedia:Substub">Wikipedia:substub</a> first!), because you're a member of the Board of Trustees (so I respect you) and you seem so active with everything to do with stubs. Do you think I've created a monster, or is it a great idea? By the way, I've read some of your criticisms (11 archives!) and I just wanted you to know that I think you're doing a great job.

<dd>Thanks for your reply. I agree, <a href="../../../s/h/o/Wikipedia%7EShortpages_db96.html" title="Wikipedia:Shortpages">Wikipedia:Shortpages</a> does indeed list what are usually considered substubs. However, not many people actually go to <a href="../../../s/h/o/Wikipedia%7EShortpages_db96.html" title="Wikipedia:Shortpages">Wikipedia:Shortpages</a>. But if someone sees the boilerplate message {{substub}} at the bottom of a page then it practically <b>shouts</b>, "Hey! This page need to be fixed and expanded!" Try comparing how many people edit the pages listed on <a href="../../../s/h/o/Wikipedia%7EShortpages_db96.html" title="Wikipedia:Shortpages">Wikipedia:Shortpages</a> to how many people see that message and directly edit the page from there. My point (if I'm being unclear): a lot more people will see that boilerplate message than will go to the <a href="../../../s/h/o/Wikipedia%7EShortpages_db96.html" title="Wikipedia:Shortpages">Wikipedia:Shortpages</a> page.

<p>I saw your addition of <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheCustomOfLife_ae8d.html" title="User:TheCustomOfLife">User:TheCustomOfLife</a> and the related talk page.</p>
<p>I believe that referencing IRC discussion to justify such actions is, generally, inappropriate, because the IRC is not logged and no one can go look and see what was actually said. Therefore, such references can lead to misunderstandings. Perhaps next time you might encourage the affected user to make a request on <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFPP_fba0.html" title="WP:RFPP">WP:RFPP</a> as well as bringing up the matter on IRC. Also, I will move your comment to the proper section shortly.</p>
<p>On a related note, I believe you and I are in agreement that widespread use of page protection on user pages is a bad thing. I have begun a campaign of unprotecting user pages where there is no recent history of vandalism. I belive this is important, because protection of user pages of favored users undermines the egalitarian nature of the project. I expect there will be some criticism of these moves and hope you will provide some support when, inevitably, the criticism comes.</p>

<p>Ah yes indeed I do agree... somewhat. But on my screen (big, easy to read 20 pt text) it shows up as perhaps three paragraphs would in your (<i>teeny tiny, need glasses to read it</i>) text. Perhaps we can find a compromise, and finally put a end to this cross-Atlantic (+ Pacific + Asia/America) feud. 16 pt text might be ok. Or perhaps a separate POD with no text at all?

<dd>People cant be everywhere, and WP has gotten a bit more compartmentalized. As it should - its growing. Discussions, debates, issues, points can often be boiled down to a quotable.

I just wanted to thank you for your excellent work on the Mediation Committee pages. I'm back, but my editing is going to be a bit restricted for a few more days as I don't have access to a computer away from work at the moment. And I've done little editing on the requests page as it's rather difficult to keep up.... And perhaps you might be interested in being the next co-chair after my term or sannse's term is up? (I can't now remember which of us is stepping down first, but I believe it's sannse...)</p>

<p>I tried editing a page called "H.323" and "H.225". The proper name for "H.225" is "H.225.0". I made the reference changes to the H.323 page, but I cannot seem to find a way to change the title of the page for "H.225".

<p>Hey Angela,</p>
<p>I am currently attending OSCON 2004 in Portland OR, and I am going to be chatting to Dirk Elmendorf, chief technology evangelist and co-founder of Rackspace Managed Hosting about possible hardware donations. It was brought to my attention by a journalist from <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linux_Format_27fc.html" title="Linux Format">Linux Format</a> magazine that Rackspace almost always has cutting edge servers, and thus they must dispose of a great deal of almost cutting edge hardware. If I get some positive response, I plan on referring him to Jimbo and the board for further discussion. Please respond to my talk page. <a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurgundavia_571f.html" title="User:Burgundavia">Burgundavia</a> 17:23, Jul 29, 2004 (UTC) aka Corey Burger</p>

<p>Hi, actually I put this up for peer review a couple of weeks ago here <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_dbd4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment">Wikipedia:Requests for comment</a> but no-one has come along yet. Unfortunately this is an orthodox vs reform conflict. It is an article of Reform faith not to be interested in Jesus, while the orthodox view has always been that there was a respectable rabbi at the heart of the matter. The Nazarene Jews (Netzarim) are indisputably orthodox Jews and have been recognised by the board of the Orthodox Yemenite Beit K'nêsêt in Raanana, Israel – Beit ha-K'nêsêt Môrêshêt Âvôt (which is recognized by the Israeli rabbinate). This keeps them firmly lodged within the orthodox Jewish Beit Din system and they are thus recognised as an authoritative body by the state of Israel. Reform Jews just cant handle this fact. I accept that claiming they are a sect of Judaism is agitative, but to mention them as within Orthodox Judaism is a fundamental fact. As it is the highly detailed and researched article has been reduced to a stub with the phrase "who call themselves Jewish" slapping the face of what it means to be orthodox. If any group "call themselves Jewish" it is the reform movement. I would like to encourage a peer review of the situation as with the <a href="../../../y/e/s/Yeshu.html" title="Yeshu">Yeshu</a> article. <a href="../../../z/e/s/User%7EZestauferov_8a0a.html" title="User:Zestauferov">Zestauferov</a> 08:24, 31 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is a general question to those endorsing Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Guanaco2. Is anyone prepared to actually <b>certify</b> the complaint along with RickK? If not, RfC policy would call for the page to be deleted soon. If I delete the listing for RickK (which seems likely at this point), I would like to either delete Guanaco's as well, or have a clear basis under existing policy for deleting one and not the other. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 20:11, 3 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Guanaco is trying to get it deleted on the grounds that I'm the only person who has tried to discuss the issues with him.

<dd>Well, the wording says:

<dd>At this point, Neutrality is in the certification section with RickK, since Neutrality seems willing to take that stand, and this hasn't been reverted yet. I'm not always sure I see the point in RfC either, except that it fills a void in our dispute resolution process, and it's as good a solution as we've been able to devise so far. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 23:05, 3 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Angela, I hope you can help me.</p>
<p>I am trying desperately to find an admin who will delete my personal pages. I am quitting this project for good due to the fight to include a horrid, almost apologetic article on the subject of child pornography. In trying to make the article somewhat more neutral during the VfD period, I removed a number of external links and some horrendous photos, but left the text intact. User "Cecropia" accused me of "unilateral censorship" and reverted the edits. It seems that he's the one responsible for the photos and symbols in the first place, allegedly to prove a point. Others are crying "censorship" as well, although the consensus seems to be leaning toward "delete."</p>
<p>I've written "Tim Starling" in an effort to have the pages deleted, but I haven't received an answer. <i>Please</i> blank my pages at your earliest convenience and confirm the deletions on my personal e-mail account.</p>
<p>I appreciate your prompt assistance in this matter, and I thank you ahead of time for any help at all that you can give. - Lucky 6.9 22:09, 3 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Angela, since Lucky brought up my name: In the middle of a VfD, Lucky took it upon himself to unilaterally remove some images, evidently without reading the extensive talk on the subject. He became angered and cursed me (literally) and Wikipedia, and decided to quit the project, even though I had posted a link to further explain the importance of those pictures. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> | <a href="../../../c/e/c/User_talk%7ECecropia_0e8d.html" title="User talk:Cecropia">Talk</a> 22:18, 3 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Community on Serbian Wikipedia doesn't want to work on Latin project, too. If we are talking about copy-paste method, it can be a lot of job. But, the main reasons for that are political. And one more but: we need Latin pages for search engines at least. So, I have one possible solution. Secondary two-letter code for Serbian language is 'sp'. It would be good to make some engine for periodical (one per hour or one per 6 hours) transliteration from Cyrillic (sr) and Latin (sp) project. Latin pages would be "protected" by default. Is it possible and who is the person that I need to talk with about technical issues? --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillosh_e5be.html" title="User:Millosh">Millosh</a> 06:29, 7 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for deleting Fiend. I was hoping a very well-respected admin would be the one to do it. I've been sticking with deleting just the more obvious cases, but that one was obnoxious enuf, and, coming from a page that's protected, likely to be problematic enuf, that I decided to try and get a better idea of just where the bar is. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 03:24, 8 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Awesome. That's exactly what I had concluded was the most valid and compelling reason to just kill it--it didn't actually add anything to the dang 'pedia. The current <a href="../../../h/a/p/Happy_Noodle_Boy_337c.html" title="Happy Noodle Boy">Happy Noodle Boy</a> (especially--lot of hits) and Melissa Carr CSDs are the sort I really don't feel comfortable deleting, although I suspect some admins do. There's no way I'd delete the k&amp;r redirs that have been there for hours--for the most part I think the more redirs, the better--keeps articles from getting written in funky places, and gets people to what they're looking for. On the other hand, I have deleted two redirs (one tagged by someone else, once I just stumbled onto) in the last day or two because didn't accomplish either (or anything else, for that matter).

<p>Angela, I made a number of changes to <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/LanguageHi.php_today" class="extiw" title="m:LanguageHi.php_today">m:LanguageHi.php today</a>. Then I saw that changes to namescape may override these.

Is it possible to modify this table to display the current values of the fields.</p>
<p>I find that to change the namespace takes longer as I have to do each item, one by one. Also, while the changes seem to be operational on some pages - eg. while editing a page, they seem to be displaying old versions when just viewing a pge.</p>
<p>Is it possible for you to put the updated LanguageHi.php in production and if there is translated text in the name space, which is not there in the .php file, then to copy it there.</p>
<p>Also, is it possible to correct the 'skin' definition. In Monobook, the top bar keeps floating left so I have to use an old version to have an operational page (this is on win98 using IE6).</p>

Now, this is not my POV, it is what has been quoted. In my articule I wrote that she is a "Broadway Legend" and User RickK continues to delete that sentence because he says it's A point of view. I wrote to him in his talk page and I also told him the magazines and newspapers call "Chita" a Legend.

<p>Hi. I'm a relatively new user to Wikipedia. You seem like the sort of person to ask for help about this. Last week I came across an article called <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holomovement.html" title="Holomovement">Holomovement</a> that was (and still is) absolutely horrible. It is being maintained by a user, <a href="../../../t/o/g/User%7ETogo_1a1d.html" title="User:Togo">togo</a> who, as far as I can tell, is crazy. I took it upon myself to try to fix this situation and have taken several steps in that direction. I did some provisional research of my own and wrote a <a href="../../../i/m/p/Implicate_and_Explicate_Order_5209.html" title="Implicate and Explicate Order">new article</a> on the topic to redirect to. but togo won't cooperate with this redirect. i put in a request for comment, as well, but so far only one person (a friend of mine that i basically had to armtwist into it) has said anything. togo was unmoved by his comments. it just seems that this is taking much longer to deal with than it should. i was wondering if you could help me speed it up. –<a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloorsheim_2e7a.html" title="User:Floorsheim">Floorsheim</a> 09:12, 16 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have a few fashion ideas for wikipedia wear, but I havent gotten the time to write you about it, what with edits,new articles, shopping, excersicing, my brother's surgery, going wild and my past birthday (3 days ago, 32!!) It has been hard for me to do other than my quota of articles per day here. To add to it Ive received a lot of books as birthday present (Im doing research on <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arizona.html" title="Arizona">Arizona</a> women and on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> in particular these days) and two video game consoles, so imagine!But I will tell youabout my fashion ideas later.</p>
<p>Well, fashion Goddess, lets just say that, if I had a romantic interest in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, as a Beatle song might have said, "it would be you".</p>
<p>I am going to include you in my list of friends, and, if I havent given you a barnstar, I will.</p>
<p>Hope to hear from you soon!</p>
<p>Sincerely yours, "<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntonioMartin_6aa4.html" title="User:AntonioMartin">Antonio Ga-ga 4u Martin</a>"</p>

<p>Hi Angela,</p>
<p>My name is Jonathan and I just got connected to Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I noticed a comment you made concerning the licensing approach used on Wikipedia, and I thought you would be a good person to ask about something to do with licensing. I hope you don't mind.</p>
<p>Basically, I am trying to understand what the GNU Free Documentation Licence enables others to do with passages that are quoted from other works, like any article might quote from another on a fair use basis. However, the issue I have is not whether such things can be further distributed (there are no restrictions on that in this case) but instead how they can be ALTERED by others.</p>
<p>To be more specific, I am beginning to write some articles related to the Baha'i Faith. Now, the sacred writings of the Faith are available on a site called the Baha'i Reference Library and may be distributed for non-commercial purposes without restriction, such permission being granted by the copyright holder. However, it is not permitted to ALTER any of the content, that is, beyond normal formatting issues like font, appearance, etc.</p>
<p>To illustrate using a more familiar Christian example: I can quote from the Sermon on the Mount and distribute it freely without any restrictions for non-commercial purposes. What I cannot do is MISQUOTE it, or distribute a passage that says "Blessed are the warmongers", while attributing it to the Book of Matthew.</p>
<p>Does the GNU FDL protect and accommodate this? It doesn't appear that the invariant sections option is designed for it.</p>
<p>Please note that I am not trying to republish anything, simply to quote where it makes sense to the flow of the article, while providing a footnote and permalink back to the original location. An example would be as follows:</p>
<p>____The cornerstone principle of the Bahá'í Faith is the oneness of humankind. Bahá'u'lláh writes, "The earth is but one country, and mankind its citizens." In line with this principle, Bahá'ís believe that the unification of mankind in a single global social order whose boundaries are those of the planet is the inevitable destiny of the human race, towards which it is being compelled by all the forces of contemporary history.____</p>
<p>Obviously, the article could benefit substantially from this kind of quotation, but I don't know whether the GNU FDL will allow it, nor if it will sufficiently protect the Bahá'í sacred writings from the kind of abuse that could possibly occur.</p>
<p>If you could provide me with some advice about this, I would deeply appreciate it.</p>
<p><br />
Many thanks,</p>
<p><br />

<dd>Hi Angela,</dd>

<dd>Thanks for getting back to me. You did answer my question and you have put my mind at rest. And yes, I am only talking about short passages that would be integrated into the normal flow of the articles.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>Thanks very much for your help.</dd>
