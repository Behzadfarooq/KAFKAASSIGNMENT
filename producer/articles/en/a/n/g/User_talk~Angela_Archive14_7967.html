<p>Hi Angela,</p>
<p>I'm from <a href="../../../../af/a/f/r/Afrikaans.html" class="extiw" title="af:Afrikaans">Afrikaans</a> and also try to start growth at other South African languages. It seems you took up the issue of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Language_Services_d79c.html" title="National Language Services">National Language Services</a> with <a href="../../../n/o/d/User%7ENode_ue_1881.html" title="User:Node ue">User:Node_ue</a> at <a href="../../../n/o/d/User_talk%7ENode_ue_c819.html#Re:Wikipedia-l:_Banned_from_editing_except_on_en" title="User talk:Node ue">User_talk:Node_ue#Re:Wikipedia-l: Banned from editing except on en</a>. Could you be so kind as to let me know on my <a href="../../../../af/a/l/i/GebruikerBespreking%7EAlias_cfb7.html" class="extiw" title="af:GebruikerBespreking:Alias">Afrikaans talk page</a> about the outcome of whether or not those are copyios under South African law? Unfortunately we don't have the manpower of the en.wp and Internet connectivity isn't always equally available. If we can reuse the manpower spent here, it would be a nice bonus for us.

<p>Hi Angela. I want to let you know that I have started a new page at Wikisource called <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Wikisource:Scriptorium/Language_domain_requests" class="extiw" title="wikisource:Wikisource:Scriptorium/Language_domain_requests">Language Domain Requests</a> that is meant to permanently monitor developments related to your decision regarding language domains.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It wasn't my decision and it wasn't a board decision. This was a community vote, not the Board saying what should be done. There is clearly not consensus on this issue yet.</dd>
</dl>
<p>It has a special section for people to record current and future requests for language domains, and a completely separate section to specifically keep track of the current opinions of Wikisource's "heavy contributors" regarding whether to grant or deny language domains to those who have requested them.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for making the page. I hope it will help to create a consensus over this issue eventually.</dd>

<p>I have very deep respect and admiration for your incredible contributions to Wikimedia. When you have deep respect for someone, you give them the benefit of the doubt even when you deeply disagree with them, and that is the case here as well. My deep respect stands despite the fact that I think the board's handling of this particular problem was deeply flawed.</p>
<p>To put it simply, the board had every right to say, and should have said, that when there is clear interest by an entire language community for a domain in their own tongue within a language-intensive, text-based project, that it is not Wikimedia policy to deny such a request. Period. The Germans made such a request.</p>
<dl>
<dd>But what arguments are there that the Germans should decide this rather than allowing the whole Wikisource community to decide it?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The argument is simply that on a language-intensive, text-based project, when there is a clear desire from a language community, that this is a fundamental Wikimedia right (the commitment to full multilingualism) that should not be subject to vote at all. Do we subject NPOV, as a policy, to a vote? No, because it is a fundamental policy of Wikimedia. Available and needed language support should be a fundamental policy as well. In fact, from the very beginning I assumed that it was. <a href="../../../d/o/v/User%7EDovi_943a.html" title="User:Dovi">Dovi</a> 04:42, Dec 1, 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The current "Language Domain Requests" honors your decision in that it will continue to monitor the opinions of the heavy users with hundreds of contributions, and if and when there is a shift in attitude among them - it will then be possible to introduce language-domains under the criterion that you have spelled out. But there is no reason to be optimistic about this, for two reasons that are not likely to change:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most monolingual users who would actively participate in their own domains will not remain long in the current Wikisource, and will not become heavy users whose votes can be counted. <a href="http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/" class="extiw" title="hewikisource:">hewikisource:</a> is ample proof that Wikisource language domains work, but few if any of the contributors there now would have participated in the general wikisource.org environment.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Far worse is the fact that serious Wikisource contributors who do not see eye-to-eye with a certain heavy contributor tend to simply leave the project. (As you and I both did earlier on; had you yourself not left, a lot of things would be different there now.) This fact makes it all the less likely that the balance of opinion among the heavy contributors will eventually change. Your decision to count only the heavy contributors greatly strengthens the hand of a "benevolent dictator" on a small project in the long term.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I completely agree, but I don't see how the Board can fairly overrule the vote without looking heavy handed and as though they are ignoring the wishes of the community.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>As above, should "communities" (however small) have the right to deny language domains in text-based, language-intensive projects? I think this specific question is so fundamental to the very nature of Wikimedia that I would like to take it to Jimbo for his comments/advise, and perhaps he can help find some way out of this mess.</p>
<p>But because of the very deep respect I mentioned earlier, I will not do it without your blessing, because the board has after all made a decision. If you strongly think the matter should just rest, I will let it do so and that's it. But if you do not in any way mind my bringing this to Jimbo even after the board's decision, then I would like to. If the latter is the case (i.e. you don't mind), then please let me know the most efficient way is to contact him about this sort of issue.

<dd>We're going to be having a Board meeting on the 12th or 13th of December. I'll put it on the agenda for then if you are happy to wait that long before the issue is raised.

<p>What is the proper way to revert vandal images? I've struggled with images throughout my time on wikipedia and am finally giving up. Whenever I click on the (rev) (assuming this will revert the current image back to the version to the right of the (rev) link) link next to an image, I get the wrong version of the image I want. You can see my luck with images like <a href="../../../b/i/l/Image%7EBillgates.jpg_4c0e.html" title="Image:Billgates.jpg">Image:Billgates.jpg</a>. This is obviously quite the problem because I appear to be vandalising and get in disputes with other wikipedians when I don't want to vandalise at all, but am simply trying to use what seems an awkward system, that should be incredibly easy. What am I missing? Thanks. --<a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlockmeal_2b16.html" title="User:Flockmeal">Flockmeal</a> 01:47, Dec 1, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>A relatively new user Critical has added the POV banner to the <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_argument.html" title="Logical argument">logical argument</a> article. I tried to respond to her/his comments, but I noticed that the same user has added the same banner to a range of articles, including physical law and mathematical rigor. Now it's possible this user is trying to make a philosophical point: complete NPOV is not possible, but who knows what their intentions are. What do you think we should do?</p>
<p>Though I am an admin, I don't like the idea of restricting anybody, particularly, since the activities of said user are relatively harmless (I think). Please have a look at the logical argument talk page and respond. I've also alerted Charles Matthews and Chalst (who has an interest in the logic pages).</p>

<dd>Part of the confusion you express below, helas, is of my own making: The vandalized page I was trying to refer to is <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_fallacy.html" title="Logical fallacy">logical fallacy</a> not <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_argument.html" title="Logical argument">logical argument</a>. I get them confused, since I have made extensive contributions to both those pages and they're dependent on each other. But in any case the response is in the logical fallacy talk page.<a href="../../../c/s/t/User%7ECSTAR_0140.html" title="User:CSTAR">CSTAR</a> 14:53, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>'<i>About Users Critical and CStar</i></p>
<p>For the record, the user Critical ( <a href="../../../c/r/i/User_talk%7ECritical_a5f7.html" title="User talk:Critical">talk</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Critical_0a89.html" title="Special:Contributions/Critical">contributions</a>), who slapped the "disputed NPoV" sticker on some pages, has made his or her first edits tonight (or today) and within less than two hours has attacked eight articles for PoV, including (ironically given the CStar example given on the <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_fallacy.html" title="Logical fallacy">Logical fallacy</a> talk page), <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physical_law.html" title="Physical law">Physical law</a>. These were the only "edits" (plus weak justifications on talk pages in the same vein as this one). I don't think the PoV claim has merit. We may ask if this series of attacks is to be taken seriously.</p>
<p>For the following reasons I am thinking that these pages has been the victim of a tiresome semi-sophisticated troll and <b>the PoV sticker should be removed sooner rather than later, if not immediately</b>. We may note that <a href="../../../c/s/t/User%7ECSTAR_0140.html" title="User:CSTAR">CStar</a> ( <a href="../../../c/s/t/User_talk%7ECSTAR_c8e3.html" title="User talk:CSTAR">talk</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CSTAR_afbd.html" title="Special:Contributions/CSTAR">contributions</a>) after making edits, paused during the period user Critical made edits, and then CStar took up responding to these edits after the series of user Critical edits ends, as if there is only one user involved, and the user logged out, changed cookies and logged back in. Further, user CStar left a note on <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7ECharles_Matthews_4bd1.html" title="User talk:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthew's talk page</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChalst_00d6.html" title="User talk:Chalst">Chalst's talk page</a>, and <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">Angela's talk page</a> pointing to a supposed PoV accusation placed on the <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_argument.html" title="Logical argument">Logical argument</a> page, when in fact no such sticker has been placed. Perhaps the irony regarding the Physical law page is not so ironic. <a href="../../../h/u/_/User%7EHu_5903.html" title="User:Hu">Hu</a> 05:19, 2004 Dec 1 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have added the following paragraph to the above referenced pages:</p>
<p>I have responded to this on the <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_fallacy.html" title="Logical fallacy">logical fallacy</a> talk page, as well as on the pages of the above mentioned users.

The user asks for procedure, which is not provided by Wikipedia rules, and cannot be voted for by these rules, ie he wants to move the article to another article, which has a different heading, and therefore the most of the text belongs to be deleted, or edited out, as it does not correspond to the heading, and then to replace the whole original article by a text written by him. The parts of the article relevant to Strong AI were already transferred to the Strong AI article. He was asked to edit the article normally, and add his text, but he doesn't want to do it this way.

<dd>I said on the talk page that I would like you to mediate, though I understand if you refuse, as I see from this talk page how busy you are. In that case, I would be thankful if you would recommend another mediator. Also, concerning that article, I hope only the biggest problem to be solved, a repeated attempts to delete the whole content of the article by different means, instead of editing it normally, and accompanied frequent offenses, or then delete the article. Different from other comments here, I even didn't ask to solve the NPOV attack problem, ie that Paul Beardsell in his only edit recently added NPOV label again, without explaining the reasons anywhere, in spite that I asked him on his talk page, and after the NPOV conflict was solved by the rules of Wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Several months ago, Paul Beardsell added NPOV label on article, and wrote the reasons for NPOV on talk page. After that, all these questions were answered, with no objections by him in several months. I was afraid to remove NPOV label though, being afraid of new offenses by him. But then resently the user removed 30% of the article, and the NPOV label. Then I said that NPOV conflict must be solved first, made the appropriate changes in accordance with the answers on talk page, and had to remove the NPOV label. Shortly after that, as I said, Paul Beardsell added NPOV label again, in spite that nothing in the article was changed.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But I don't ask this problem to be solved, this is a minor problem compared to all much bigger problems regarding this article. I agree the NPOV label to remain, if this helps to avoid further conflicts with Paul Beardsell and Matthew Stannard. Again, so sorry for taking your time with these problems, I know you are busy, and I'm very thankful to you. <a href="../../../t/k/o/User%7ETkorrovi_0c02.html" title="User:Tkorrovi">Tkorrovi</a> 18:07, 4 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi - you recently added a new category Category:Artificial lakes. There was an existing category, <a href="../../../r/e/s/Category%7EReservoirs_e56e.html" title="Category:Reservoirs">Category:Reservoirs</a>, which seems mighty similar to me.

<p>Greetings! A while age you signed up to help tag images, so I thought I'd let you know what's been going on lately in the image-tagging world.</p>
<p>First off, things are moving slow, but at least they're moving in the right direction. (What I mean is, more images are tagged every month than the number of newly uploaded images without tags, so the net number of untagged images keep decreasing.) But judging from the progress on the lists at <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYann_Untagged_Images_164a.html" title="User:Yann/Untagged Images">User:Yann/Untagged Images</a>, most of the time it's just me tagging images. And it sure gets lonely out on the tagging prairie.</p>
<p>Second, I have basically rewritten the <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYann_Untagged_Images_164a.html" title="User:Yann/Untagged Images">User:Yann/Untagged Images</a> page. Hopefully that will make it easier for people to help, and will attract new recruits. What do you think of the new text and layout?</p>
<p>And third, there have been a <i>bunch</i> of new tags added in the last month. Check out <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags</a> for the new tags and new organization, mostly done by <a href="../../../z/o/n/User%7EZondor_d557.html" title="User:Zondor">Zondor</a>.</p>

<p>You really wouldn't believe the ribbing i get for visiting this place after i let it slip at work once, my colleagues don't know the www. address though which is good for my temperament!&#160;:) the joke is that my last job was as a senior at one of the largest domain name and web space providors in the UK and i was actually encouraged to use the net as much as possible... i do still try&#160;:) but i find it interesting the predudice towards the net that still exists in this country by some people. Birmingham is one of the least most internet sophisticated places in the UK especially for it's size, most potential users are most likely discussing the pro's and con's of the net down their local. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Boulevard_f817.html" title="User:Nick Boulevard">Nick Boulevard</a> 00:06, 19 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Angela: I had added some biographical text pertaining to the German WWII General FRANZ HALDER in the already-existing bio page. However, you apparently found my work, and (if I understand your note) you thought it may have been cut from some other article. I wrote the text myself, and tried to cut &amp; paste it in from my MS-Word document. This may not have worked. Please inform me BILLGARRISONJR@MINDSPRING.COM how I should retype my text to have it inserted back into the Franz Halder Wikipedia page.</p>
<p>What I thought my main problem was that when I try to create a new article, my sentences seems to run into the right-hand side margin for seveal feet. How do I click some "wrap around" button (or column width -- and what should it be?) so that my column width matches Widipedia's 8-9 inches or so?</p>
<p>Also, where is "spell check" when I'm writing an article?</p>
<p>Thank you for your review of this inquiry.</p>
<p>I've also writen articles on ABRAHAM ADAN and WALTER WARLIMONT. Someone has apparently incorporated wrap-around in them for me. -- BillGarrisonJr</p>

<p>Hi, I created an account from the advice of a friend. I've tried it out and I wish to be anonymous again - the insults, insinuations, and general unfriendly reception I've read is too much for me to tolerate. I do not wish to stoop to the level of name-calling and unsupported speculations. So far, I have not experienced anything beneficial compared to being just anonymous before. So, I would like to exercise my <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?RightToVanish" class="external text" title="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?RightToVanish" rel="nofollow">RightToVanish</a>.

<dd>Right to vanish really applies to people using their real name or a name they usually go by on the internet. Are you really bothered that your one page move be reassigned away from your four dots user name? Your other contributions are to talk pages, which you've signed, so those can't be removed as your signature will remain in the page history. There is no reason you can't go back to not using an account and forget about ".:." account that never really edited anyway, is there? However, if you do feel it is worthwhile to pursue this, the correct page to request that on is <a href="../../../c/h/a/Wikipedia%7EChanging_username_3d5c.html" title="Wikipedia:Changing username">Wikipedia:Changing username</a> as this is not something I can do for you. I'm sorry if you feel you have been insulted, but perhaps you would find if you continued to edit and built up some trust under this account, that this would change. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 06:46, Dec 11, 2004 (UTC)

I was only trying to help retain an <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_La_6ab6.html" title="La La">article</a> on vfd, but afterwards I was called a 'moron' and my motives were taken in bad faith. According to <a href="../../../a/c/c/Wikipedia%7EAccount_deletion_7b66.html" title="Wikipedia:Account deletion">Wikipedia:Account deletion</a>, it states that I can contact a developer and have my account renamed. It says that using my real name is a particular case and not the general rule. I would really like to have this account gone as a way to forget this whole incident occurred. It brings up very upsetting feelings for me every time I visit this site and become reminded of what happened. I humbly plead for my account's deletion to put my mind at rest. I feel very traumatized by the situation and would like to have peace of mind whenever I visit your site. Thank you for your time. .:. 07:34, 11 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Angela!</p>
<p>Did anything happen at the board meeting?</p>
<p>In the meantime, there is more to read about the ongoing Wikisource saga at:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Wikisource:Scriptorium/Language_domain_requests#A_constructive_proposal" class="extiw" title="wikisource:Wikisource:Scriptorium/Language_domain_requests">wikisource:Wikisource:Scriptorium/Language_domain_requests#A_constructive_proposal</a></li>

</ul>
<p>There is a big need for someone competent (i.e. not myself!) to update the translation of the Php codes at he.wikisource.org. Two other people have already asked that it be done, and someone good has volunteered to do it. Has the request been made correctly? <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Requests_for_permissions#Current_requests_for_permissions" class="external autonumber" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Requests_for_permissions#Current_requests_for_permissions" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></p>

<p>I've been to the Oyster Bar, Katz's, Grimaldi's and Peter Luger's.</p>
<p>When my friend visits from Sydney he always enjoys the HUGE Pastrami sandwich at Katz's (the place made famous for the fake orgasm scene in the movie "When Harry Met Sally".)</p>
<p>The Oyster Bar and Grand Central Station are worth a visit just to see the ceilings even if you don't want to grab a meal.</p>
<p>Grimaldi's has good pizza... but they only sell whole pies.</p>
<p>Peter Lugers uses the same beef in their burgers as the do in their aged steaks. Go at lunchtime and you'll get better service.</p>
<p>Not on the list is another place I take my friend from Sydney: If you like good South Indian food check out Banjara at 97 First Avenue in Manhattan (corner of East 6th street) where you can get both veggie and non-veggie dishes that are yummy. (There are less expensive Indian restaurants on East 6th Street between 1st and 2nd Avenues...some with live music in the evenings.)</p>

<p>Hi. I noticed you have worked on the <a href="../../../s/u/s/Sustainability.html" title="Sustainability">Sustainability</a> page.

<p>You've been around Wikipedia a while, and have always helped me with other issues, so I'm hoping you might have some suggestions with this. <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Gabriel_Uzquiano_89b8.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Gabriel Uzquiano">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Gabriel Uzquiano</a> has had speedy tags added a couple times, expressing concern that a prank is embarrassing the subject individual. I, and others, have removed the tags, which I guess is why I got the email that I have posted here (including my reply and their follow-up response). Any ideas of how to fix this? (I don't know what policy is on archived material, EG editting or deleting it.) Policies or precedents you can point me to? etc. Thanks <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 04:11, 19 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There isn't really a policy, but I think people's privacy ought to be respected. Would blanking the page so it didn't show up in Google searches be a solution if people are opposed to deleting it? <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 21:53, Dec 19, 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>See, I knew you'd be a good person to ask, because you'd probably come up with a good solution even if there was no policy or precedent to fall back on. I've replaced the page with a brief note to use the edit history if someone wants to view the discussion (mostly so a) it's less likely to get reverted as 'vandalism', and b) it doesn't get speedied as a 'blank page'). It solves the problem without doing anything as drastic as deleting it, which I think some people would object to on the grounds that then 'only admins' could review the discussion.

<dd>Sorry for swearing, but I just couldn't think of a better way of expressing great irritation. Also I have only just noticed the note at the top of that page, saying it is deprecated. Fine, but <i>how</i> can I get the right people's attention without going on to bothering others (eg you) on their personal talk pages? (I don't know what #mediawiki is. A newsgroup?) By editing locale files we are also doing Wikimedia a little favor, since the load on the server is lower when the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/l10n" class="extiw" title="w:l10n">l10n</a> is done through .php files as opposed to MediaWiki: namespace. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamir_2421.html" title="User:Ramir">Ramir</a> 08:16, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<p>Merry Christmas, Angela! I hope the holidays bring much peace and joy to you and yours. My concern regards the changes I've made to the W.C. Handy page. Upon my observation, I first thought the page was plagiarized and hence very well may have violated copyright. However, I was wrong. Yet, the information contained on the original page did not reference any source or citation, save for a brief, excerpted online version of a biography which was (and remains) in no wise exemplary. As a long-time resident of the area of Handy's birth, I have done research into his life and music. Motivated by what I perceived to be a poorly written article which was little better than a stub, I completely rewrote it, citing sources, and adding external links to current events that celebrate and commemorate his work. Referencing the previous article, there was (and which I incorprated in a revision) a reference to some of his works which I felt though only somewhat appropriate, would be better suited in a musicology article. They mentioned only one person's opinion - the writer - again, with no source citation of any kind. In my complete rewrite, I referenced the subject's autobiography, and several independent sources which are included in the external links. There is, in my estimation, a more fully complete picture of the breadth and character of the subject, and one which the casual visitor/reader would find fascinating. One example is that he started his own highly successful publishing company in an era of aparteid, and was widely acclaiamed by all. Though that detail was not necessarily of itself important, in context of the time, it was. And, seeking to present and offer understanding of the subject in context of his era and the current era was my objective. Please take a look at the article(s) and share your thoughts with me. Realize also however, that some minor formatting issues may be present, forwhich others more experienced will hopefully and gladly correct. The main thrust of my concern is for content, not mark-up.

<dd>No they are not feature suggestions (although some users might give some). They are generic suggestions.

Actually I made a page before about <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Wikipedia_b88c.html" title="Criticism of Wikipedia">Criticism of Wikipedia</a>. Some people thought it is not in correct name space.(Although I intended it to be an encyclopedic article). It was asked for delete. (Currently it seems that vote to delete will fail). So I am just asking that is the name space for <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUser_Suggestions_0c86.html" title="Wikipedia:User Suggestions">Wikipedia:User Suggestions</a> is 'incorrect enough' to be ask for deletion?</dd>

<p>Salve, Angela! I set up an account on Wikiquote a while back and for my user page put in a redirect to my Wikipedia user page. I'd like to change that now but can't access it to do so because when a redirect crosses over the blue link "Redirected from" does not appear. I'm wondering if you could blank or delete my Wikiquote user page so I could start over there? (I'm asking you because while I'm an admin here, I don't have privileges there.)<br />
Second, is there a list of Wikiquote admins? I tried to call up one using the "Special" function as can be done here, but it didn't work. Further, there is no page of recently created admins and the RFA page there was last edited eight months ago.<br />

<dd>Good question. A lot of it has been on the mailing lists, so isn't easy to point at. On the wiki, related pages include all those talking about having stable versions of articles since those could lead to an option for users to view only credible revisions of articles, so perhaps those, and their talk pages, might be good starting points, but there is no one place with all this discussion.

<p>Hi Angela, You are probably too busy to do anything about this, but I am upset. Some time ago I was extolling the virtues of Wikipedia to my 12 year old daughter and she and I together created a page for her school "Girls Middle School, Mountain View, California". I am upset because I just discovered that the page was deleted back in October. I found the discussion about deletion of the page and mostly the votes for deletion were because it was non-notable. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Girls%27_Middle_School%2C_Mountain_View%2C_California" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Girls%27_Middle_School%2C_Mountain_View%2C_California" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Girls%27_Middle_School%2C_Mountain_View%2C_California</a> for details. I note that you consider yourself to be a non-deletionist so I wanted to ask you about this. I also bring it up with you since you had earlier flagged the page as being a possible copright violation (and you were right) so my daughter and I rewrote it and tried to make it more relevent and descriptive instead of being a puff piece taken from the website of the school. So, I am upset that it got deleted as being non-notable - it certainly is notable to my daughter and classmates.</p>
<p>Another issue I have is that I did not even know that the page was marked for discussion and deletion. In fact looking at my watchlist, there is no mention of the page at all anywhere! Isn't there a mechanism for notifying people that have a page on their watchlist that the page is about to get deleted? Maybe there was a period of time when I did not log on and check my watchlist, but I don't think so. Is there any recourse? If I recreate the page will it just get deleted again?

<p>Hello love,</p>
<p>I really like the new user page look and the photo - very angelic&#160;:-). Sitting in an Internet cafe in a subway station -- 2 EUR/hour, but no IRC and no Firefox&#160;:-(. The interview went fine, though it took me some time to switch from technical answers to the social ones which the interviewer wanted. And I really should start ironing my shirts.&#160;;-) It took place in a small cafe which is part of the <a href="../../../w/d/r/WDR_99d0.html" title="WDR">WDR</a> TV station, and we had lots of background noises to deal with, so we had to do another take whenever someone started hammering... I'm off to McDonald's in a minute and then I'll head to the second interview, which is on the subject of weblogs as an <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astroturfing.html" title="Astroturfing">astroturfing</a> tool (colloq.

<p>Hope all is fine and dandy! Sorry to bring these here but... recently i have been finding many errors when editing the Brum related pages, these errors occur when i try to save my work, the reason given by wikipedia is that the servers are not 100%, is this classed as down time? anyway, i am sure i have seen requests for donations to help wikipedia survive as it grows to incredible, educational proportions.</p>
<p>This is fine but... a few random one off payments are NOT going to help Wikipedia remain an easily accesible power source which is quick and simple to edit, my suggestion would be to either:</p>
<p>a) remain free to view of course but for all members an anual fee of £5 (world equivalent) would be required to allow editors into the pages, this is a reasonable fee and would help with obvious expenses. I would definately be happy to pay this for the privelage to edit here.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think we should ever charge people to <i>edit</i>. People already give up their free time; they shouldn't be required to give up their money as well. However, see <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/membership" class="extiw" title="meta:membership">meta:membership</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 23:21, Jan 18, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>b) Keep wikipedia as it is but ask for a petition to be drawn up requesting educational funding with the signiatures and addresses of every single member of wikipedia worldwide, and with the donations from wikipedians a professional team from wikipedia could approach each and every government of contributing member countries with a view to keep Wikipedia free and accessible to every one regardless of creed, colour or religion (i'm talking about funding). After all Wikipedia is revolutionary in the sense that it is a mostly coherent mirror of society and would, i imagine, contribute vastly to people seeking information and eductaion online... for free!</p>

<p>I notice many wiki pages that i have edited are now being rated as high p.r. (importance) by google and other info sites are actually copying pages from wiki and pasting them as their own, this shows just how much wikipedia is regarded as a reliable and truthfull source for info.</p>

<dd>Angela, FYI, this is something that has been discussed at some length at <a href="../../../e/n/g/Talk%7EEngland_1e33.html#National_anthem" title="Talk:England">Talk:England#National anthem</a> way back in June 2004, and the consensus at the time was to describe the UK's constituent parts as <i>nations</i> rather than <i>countries</i>. Unfortunately WikiUser appears not to have accepted the consensus and is once again trying to delete the term "nations" in a number of UK-related articles. I don't think anyone would object to a change in terms if a consensus was in favour; perhaps WikiUser could propose an RfC to endorse such a change? -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 18:50, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That is not true. There was no consensus only abuse of me from the moment I joined and politely spoke to people. And you have targetted me for abuse constantly SINCE I JOINED. There is no possible debate about this. Britain is the nation. It is the law. And a fact that any British person from five up has known from 1707. Or look in any REAL encyclopedia. Come here with a scottish passport then. If people put "nationality scottish" on their census or other forms they will be liable for prosecution. This is supposed to be an encyclopedia!!!</dd>

<p>As I took the trouble to point out on the page: "People should note please that: Putting information in articles that is 300 years out of date again and again, month after month, amounts to vandalism.</p>
<p>The Wikipedia Foundation's Wikipedia is a vehicle for constant anti-British and anti-English racism. And I have every right to oppose such filthy and ignorant racism. If people keep up their bizzare racism I insist that the same filth is done to America. For example that it is listed here as having no right to exist and is really a fake country, actually consisting of British, French and Mexican territories."</p>
<p>If I go to every page that mentions the USA and change them again and again for months on end to say that American is a British, Mexican and French territory, or even do it once, they'd all go nuts and start banning me as they have 3 times-each time it was against the stated rules.<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiUser_82f9.html" title="User:WikiUser">WikiUser</a> 19:08, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, Angela! I am adressing you, because I know that you helped establish Serbian Wikipedia (plus you are one of the most active users here on en: ). I've been elected by our community to represent Serbian Wikipedia on English Wikipedia, as ambassador. Here are my <a href="../../../../sr/%D0%B0/%D0%BC/%D0%B1/%D0%92%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%BF%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B0%7E%D0%90%D0%BC%D0%B1%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B0_25c6.html" class="extiw" title="sr:Википедија:Амбасада">credentials</a>. Now, i've looked on en:, but haven't found if there is any procedure to register person as ambassador (like in diplomacy when you give credentials to president of given country&#160;;) . I'd appreciate if you could update me about this potencial procedure. --<a href="../../../o/b/r/User%7EObradovic_Goran_8d03.html" title="User:Obradovic Goran">Obradović Goran</a> <a href="../../../o/b/r/User_talk%7EObradovic_Goran_036b.html" title="User talk:Obradovic Goran">(<font color="red">t</font><font color="blue">a<sup>l</sup></font><font color="gray">k</font></a> 23:53, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Angela, By the way, I am interested that you've decided to "nofollow" all the external links on WP. I guess announcing to Robots not to trust these links in assessing the web amounts to an admission that open edit is a failure and the content of WP isn't really maintained/quality. Personally I think particularly longer term content of WP IS of generally okay quality so you should consider some cleverer approach on external links (e.g. have a admin vetted list of valid domains for outward links) but if you guys feel the show is falling apart I guess I am not in a position to argue. Very sad though. --<a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a><a href="../../../b/o/z/User_talk%7EBozMo_4fce.html" title="User talk:BozMo">|talk</a> 11:09, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I admit you are right about that. The vote isn't cast about what to do immediately (perhaps it would be paranoid to suggest the wording is chosen to avoid any reversal) and re-reading the votes cast I didn't read the words carefully enough first time. I guess the fact that this seems to have been done (and nofollow is "on") w/o discussion has got a bit up my nose; rather irrational: I guess I would have been happy if sysops or Jimbo had gone in a corner and done it without consultation.

<dd>Interesting reflection of how differently our brains are wired (you have astonished me on very other things in the past). IMHO it is clearly neither a technical nor an editorial decision but a political one. It is a public delaration that WikiPedia cannot be relied on even in the broad statistical sense which a search engine relies on sources. As said elsewhere, Britannia must have cracked champagne over this one. Roll on version 1.0 when presumably we'll be back to claiming we have usefulness as a source. --<a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a><a href="../../../b/o/z/User_talk%7EBozMo_4fce.html" title="User talk:BozMo">|talk</a> 10:04, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I don't see joining in efforts to reduce spam as a reflection on our own view of the quality of our links. If people want good links chosen by Wikipedians, they can go to a Wikipedia article and see that.

<dd>Search Engines only exist for people, they don't have a separate existence and they are integral to how the web works. Saying "this page is not reliable for search engines" and "this page is unreliable" is IMHO an identical statement. If you want to become a better web authority the fact you push engines around will get noticed by people with other serious reference sites like universities etc. That brings in people, and they will want to improve our quality. People find WikiPedia using "backlinks" on google on a site, especially on university sites. Backlinks on serious sites is the quickest way to find reference articles on a subject--<a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a><a href="../../../b/o/z/User_talk%7EBozMo_4fce.html" title="User talk:BozMo">|talk</a></dd>

I've also clarified <a href="http://br1an.net/2005/02/yahoo-employee-inserts-conspiracy.html" class="external text" title="http://br1an.net/2005/02/yahoo-employee-inserts-conspiracy.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<p>May be, should we incorporate this self-discipline into the policy itself, just a thought. Though the talk pages are technically under GFDL, I feel such issues ought to be resolved within our talk pages itself. The current fiasco anyway was a result of a misunderstanding, which could've been resolved very easily had we sought/gave clarifications. In any case, it has left an indelible mark (unpleasant) in me. It was definitely a damage on my online and to some extent offline reputation. I don't put the blame any individual to be completely responsible for this though. -- <a href="../../../s/u/n/User%7ESundar_8811.html" title="User:Sundar">Sundar</a> 06:00, Feb 8, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Brion told me there's already a feature called Live Preview in MediaWiki 1.5, so I've opened a name change section in <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilaf_Live_Preview_f724.html" title="User:Pilaf/Live Preview">User:Pilaf/Live Preview</a> as I can't decide by myself.

<p>Hello, It is the first time that I try to contact you. Since you are a member of the Board of Trustees of Wikimedia, I thought that you could help as judge in a Controversy that has been for a long time regarding the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Bank_e8a4.html" title="West Bank">West Bank</a> article. It is virtualy impossible to colaborate in it, since another user keeps deleting and preventing to stated something. It is not fair for us, that try to stated a NPOV that, another is imposing its opinion or ideas. Wikipedia must be a free and balance (not in the FOX NEWS Channel way) enciclopedia and it is not right that somebody try to impose its point of view. Thanks, my user name is <a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMesshermit_7871.html" title="User:Messhermit">Messhermit</a> and you can comparate both changes in the page History</p>

<p>I notice you seem to oppose deletionism, so... Lots of it is happening over at wikibooks. The way it works is typically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Somebody puts serious effort (blood, sweat, and tears) into a book/article/module/whatever.</li>
<li>Somebody is offended, and lists the article for deletion.</li>
<li>Votes are counted...
<ul>
<li>The author's vote is often discarded.</li>
<li>Simple majority is considered consensus.</li>
<li>Often, the offended person counts the votes.</li>
<li>Voting is always considered valid, even with very few votes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Deletion is performed
<ul>
<li>It is sudden, with no additional warning of how the votes were interpreted.</li>
<li>Often, the offended person does the deletion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I could go for 85% concensus with 95% statistical certainty. (so 17 of 19 would not do, but 1700 of 1900 probably would -- I don't have the tables handy) A reasonable shortcut to avoid statistical tables would be to always give the article some extra votes (15 perhaps) against deletion.</p>
<p>Sometimes things are even worse. The admittedly-unusual Cookbook:Human apparently had actual content, but did not get a vote. I suspect that the content was greatly in need of fixing, but I am unable to determine this now. (IMHO, all users should have access to deleted articles.) I have fixed a great many modules in the cookbook, and would have been happy to find an appropriate way to fix this one. (if you can ignore the awful pun, a tasteful way)</p>

<p>One of mine has just been deleted. It was about the humourous verse Boil it down widely known to writers to emphasise the need for concisness in writing, and was part of a section I had added to one of our tutorials on how to write. I have taken the week-end out before doing anything about it in order to cool down. My beef is that 1) the original request for deletion was made by an anonymous editor. 2) Nobody contacted me on my talk page to raise a query. Was the correct procedure followed here?</p>
<p>One of the respondents did make some suggestions as to where it might be better placed, but before I could do anything about it it was deleted. The problem seems to be that it was held to be no part of an encyclopaedia. But it was not ever meant to be an encyclopaedic article: it was part of a tutorial. Is there any means of splitting out essential tutorial links from the encyclopaedia proper? Clearly I put it in the wrong place and am glad to be corrected, but the tone of the language of the others fazed me somethat. There was, I gather, a Be kind to Newbies page. Maybe we ought to have a Be kind to experienced editors who make a mistake page as well.

<dd>"This should be no big deal" has been widely attributed to Jimbo. Do you disagree? I guess you can, but... non-admins are horribly restricted. I have a <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Requests_for_adminship" class="external text" title="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Requests_for_adminship" rel="nofollow">request for adminship</a> (on wikibooks, not here) because of this. Regular users can not move a page over a redirect if it has been blanked or otherwise changed. Regular users can not even view deleted modules, making such users unable to salvage the good from the bad and unable to investigate suspicious admin actions. Regular users can not even delete their own typos, like the module I initially created with a "Coobkook:" prefix. I see that somebody else had done "CookbookL". (the "L" being next to ":" on the keyboard) <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbertCahalan_d719.html" title="User:AlbertCahalan">AlbertCahalan</a> 19:31, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree that adminship should be "no big deal" for as long as it <i>is</i> a big deal to have someone's admin rights removed. If it were possible to remove bad admins, we could take the "no big deal" approach, but until then, it's quite reasonable to expect certain standards from a user before they can be an admin. Note that Jimbo's statement was made over two years ago, when the community was far smaller than it is now, and when the abilities admins held were far less. They couldn't even ban logged in users back then. This was also a year before the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">Criteria for speedy deletion</a> page existed, and when VfD was a single page that could be handled by a couple of admins. There were far fewer policies, so adminship was a much simpler matter back then. It was also a time when admins could check on other admin actions far more easily, since there were only 20 deletions a day, compared to over 800 in the last 24 hours! It may not have been a big deal in 2003, but I don't believe that statement holds true now. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a> 21:38, Feb 19, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Angela, can you make me a user at wikimediafoundation so I can correct typoes on Dutch pages? Thanks. Btw, I see you're busy with wikicities. I hadn't heard of that before. <a href="../../../c/e/_/User%7ECE_3c1b.html" title="User:CE">CE</a> 18:55, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Angela,</p>
<p>I wonder if you can change the label "Bahasa Sunda" which is automatically appears on interlanguage link to "Basa Sunda", because "bahasa" is Indonesian translation for "basa" in Sundanese.

<dd>Sorry, but this is not something I can do. Asking on <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Non-development_tasks_for_developers" class="extiw" title="meta:Non-development_tasks_for_developers">meta:Non-development tasks for developers</a> might be one way to get it changed. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 23:45, Feb 22, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
