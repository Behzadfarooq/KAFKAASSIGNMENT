<p>Anglicans traditionally date the origins of their Church to the arrival in England of the first Archbishop of Canterbury, <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augustine_of_Canterbury_bee9.html" title="Augustine of Canterbury">Saint Augustine of Canterbury</a> at the end of the <a href="../../../6/t/h/6th_century.html" title="6th century">6th century</a>. However, the origins of the English Church extend farther back, Christianity having first gained a foothold during the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Britain_2a7f.html" title="Roman Britain">Roman occupation</a> prior to the <a href="../../../5/t/h/5th_century.html" title="5th century">5th century</a>, possibly as early as the <a href="../../../1/s/t/1st_century.html" title="1st century">1st century</a>. The first recorded Christian martyr in Britain, <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Alban_6aca.html" title="Saint Alban">Saint Alban</a>, is thought to have lived in the early <a href="../../../4/t/h/4th_century.html" title="4th century">4th century</a>, and his prominence in Anglican <a href="../../../h/a/g/Hagiography.html" title="Hagiography">hagiography</a> is reflected in the number of <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parish_church.html" title="Parish church">parish churches</a> of which he is patron. Irish Anglicans also trace their origins back to the founding saint of Irish Christianity (<a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Patrick_4ddc.html" title="Saint Patrick">Saint Patrick</a>) who was a Roman Briton and pre-dated Anglo-Saxon Christianity.</p>
<p>Anglicans consider <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celtic_Christianity_3a66.html" title="Celtic Christianity">Celtic Christianity</a> a forerunner of their church, since the re-establishment of Christianity in the early sixth century came via <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Irish</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scottish</a> missionaries, notably <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Patrick_4ddc.html" title="Saint Patrick">Saint Patrick</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columba.html" title="Columba">Saint Columba</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> This distinctive form of Catholic Christianity remained, even after the <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synod_of_Whitby_7518.html" title="Synod of Whitby">Synod of Whitby</a> in <a href="../../../6/6/4/664.html" title="664">664</a> decided that the church throughout Britain should conform to the contemporary Roman customs introduced by Augustine and other missionaries to the Anglo-Saxons. This persistence of Celtic traditions, along with the implementation of <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Gregory_I_367c.html" title="Pope Gregory I">Pope Gregory I</a>'s instructions to Augustine to incorporate pagan customs and festivals into religious life and practice, meant that English Christianity assumed a distinctive indigenous character<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>While Anglicans acknowledge that the repudiation of papal authority by <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_VIII_of_England_590f.html" title="Henry VIII of England">Henry VIII of England</a> led to the Church of England existing as a separate entity, they also believe that it is in continuity with the pre-Reformation Church of England. Quite apart from its distinct customs and liturgies (such as the <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarum_Rite_5799.html" title="Sarum Rite">Sarum rite</a>), the organizational machinery of the Church of England was in place by the time of the Synod of Hertford in <a href="../../../6/7/2/672.html" title="672">672</a>–<a href="../../../6/7/3/673.html" title="673">673</a> when the English bishops were for the first time able to act as one body under the leadership of the Archbishop of Canterbury. Henry's <a href="../../../a/c/t/Act_in_Restraint_of_Appeals_084a.html" title="Act in Restraint of Appeals">Act in Restraint of Appeals</a> (<a href="../../../1/5/3/1533.html" title="1533">1533</a>) and the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Acts_of_Supremacy_7014.html" title="Acts of Supremacy">Acts of Supremacy</a> (<a href="../../../1/5/3/1534.html" title="1534">1534</a>) declared that the English crown was "the only supreme head in earth of the Church of England, called <i>Ecclesia Anglicana</i>," in order "to repress and extirpate all errors, heresies, and other enormities and abuses heretofore used in the same." The development of the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thirty-Nine_Articles_3b7d.html" title="Thirty-Nine Articles">Thirty-Nine Articles</a> of religion and the passage of the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Acts_of_Uniformity_9798.html" title="Acts of Uniformity">Acts of Uniformity</a> culminating in the <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabethan_Religious_Settlement_2ddc.html" title="Elizabethan Religious Settlement">Elizabethan Religious Settlement</a> resulted in a Church that describes itself as both Catholic and Reformed with the English monarch as its <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Governor_a6b4.html" title="Supreme Governor">Supreme Governor</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Reformation_c56d.html" title="English Reformation">English Reformation</a> was initially driven by the dynastic goals of Henry VIII, who, in his quest for a <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_consort.html" title="Queen consort">consort</a> who would bear him a male heir, found it expedient to replace <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papacy.html" title="Papacy">papal authority</a> with the supremacy of the English crown. The early legislation focused primarily on questions of temporal and spiritual supremacy, however subsequent legislation put a decidedly <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant.html" title="Protestant">Protestant</a> spin on Henry's agenda. The introduction of the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Bible_c217.html" title="Great Bible">Great Bible</a> in <a href="../../../1/5/3/1538.html" title="1538">1538</a> brought a <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vernacular.html" title="Vernacular">vernacular</a> translation of the Scriptures into churches. The <a href="../../../d/i/s/Dissolution_of_the_Monasteries_9b7b.html" title="Dissolution of the Monasteries">Dissolution of the Monasteries</a> and the seizure of their assets by <a href="../../../1/5/4/1540.html" title="1540">1540</a> brought huge amounts of church land and property under the jurisdiction of the Crown, and ultimately into the hands of the English nobility. This simultaneously removed the greatest centres of loyalty to the Pope and created vested interests which made a powerful material incentive to support a separate Christian church in England under the rule of the Crown.</p>
<p>By <a href="../../../1/5/4/1549.html" title="1549">1549</a>, the process of creating a new and distinct national church was fully initiated by the publication of the first vernacular prayer book, the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Common_Prayer_9e7e.html" title="Book of Common Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a>, and the enforcement of the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Acts_of_Uniformity_9798.html" title="Acts of Uniformity">Acts of Uniformity</a>, establishing English as the language of public worship. The theological justification for Anglican distinctiveness was begun by the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishop_of_Canterbury_1091.html" title="Archbishop of Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a> <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Cranmer_521e.html" title="Thomas Cranmer">Thomas Cranmer</a>, the principal author of the first Prayer Book, and continued by other thinkers such as <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Hooker_28e0.html" title="Richard Hooker">Richard Hooker</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lancelot_Andrewes_da02.html" title="Lancelot Andrewes">Lancelot Andrewes</a>. Cranmer had studied in Europe and was influenced by the ideas of the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reformation.html" title="Reformation">Reformers</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Calvin_f3ea.html" title="John Calvin">John Calvin</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Bucer_1193.html" title="Martin Bucer">Martin Bucer</a>, as well as the Roman Catholic theologian <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desiderius_Erasmus_12e7.html" title="Desiderius Erasmus">Desiderius Erasmus</a>.</p>
<p>During the short reign of <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_VI_of_England_55c4.html" title="Edward VI of England">Edward VI</a>, Henry's son, Cranmer and others moved the Church of England significantly towards a more Protestant <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calvinist.html" title="Calvinist">Calvinist</a> and <a href="../../../z/w/i/Zwinglian.html" title="Zwinglian">Zwinglian</a> position, which was reflected in the development of the second Prayer Book (<a href="../../../1/5/5/1552.html" title="1552">1552</a>) and of the Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion (originally numbering forty-two). This reform was reversed abruptly in the subsequent reign of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_I_of_England_3d2b.html" title="Mary I of England">Queen Mary</a>, a Roman Catholic who re-established communion with Rome. Under <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_I_of_England_2ce6.html" title="Elizabeth I of England">Queen Elizabeth I</a> the English church incorporatied aspects of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant.html" title="Protestant">Protestant</a> theology, and at the time it was regarded as a Protestant body mid-way between Zwinglianism and Lutheranism.</p>

<p>In the <a href="../../../1/6/t/16th_century.html" title="16th century">16th century</a>, religious life was an important part of the cement which held society together and formed an important basis for extending and consolidating political power. Differences in religion were likely to lead to civil unrest at the very least, with <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treason.html" title="Treason">treason</a> and foreign invasion acting as real threats. Elizabeth's solution to the problem of minimising bloodshed over religion in her dominions was the <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabethan_Religious_Settlement_2ddc.html" title="Elizabethan Religious Settlement">religious settlement</a> most compellingly articulated in the development of the <a href="../../../1/5/5/1559.html" title="1559">1559</a> Book of Common Prayer. This version of the prayer book combined elements of the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calvinist.html" title="Calvinist">Calvinist</a>, <a href="../../../z/w/i/Zwinglian.html" title="Zwinglian">Zwinglian</a> <a href="../../../1/5/5/1552.html" title="1552">1552</a> version with the more apparently Catholic 1549 version (which had made generous use of the traditional Sarum liturgy). The prayer book revision was buttressed by a revision of the Articles of Religion and mediating <a href="../../../r/u/b/Rubric.html" title="Rubric">rubrics</a> concerning vestments and liturgy.Many believe that Elizabeth's goal was a church with a fixed form of worship in which everybody was expected to participate, but a belief system that was formulated in such a way that most in the theological spectrum would be able to give assent. Article VI of the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thirty-Nine_Articles_3b7d.html" title="Thirty-Nine Articles">Thirty-Nine Articles</a>, by the use of negative terminology, subtly inverted the Protestant principle that all things must be proved from the Scriptures so that only those things which could be proved by an appeal to the Scriptures must be believed as articles of the faith. The bulk of the population acceded to Elizabeth's religious settlement with varying degrees of enthusiasm or resignation, but more militant Protestants (the so-called <a href="../../../p/u/r/Puritan.html" title="Puritan">Puritans</a>) and those who continued to recognise papal supremacy opposed it and were executed and cracks in the façade of religious unity in England appeared.</p>
<p>For the next century, through the reigns of <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_I_of_England_1562.html" title="James I of England">James I</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_I_of_England_350c.html" title="Charles I of England">Charles I</a>, and culminating in the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Civil_War_6bfe.html" title="English Civil War">English Civil War</a> and the protectorate of <a href="../../../o/l/i/Oliver_Cromwell_331c.html" title="Oliver Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a>, there were significant swings back and forth between two factions: the Puritans (and other radicals) who sought more far-reaching reform, and the more conservative churchmen who aimed to keep closer to traditional beliefs and practices. The failure of political and ecclesiastical authorities to submit to Puritan demands for more extensive reform was one of the causes of open warfare. By continental standards the level of violence over religion was not high, but the casualties included a king, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_I_of_England_350c.html" title="Charles I of England">Charles I</a> and an Archbishop of Canterbury, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Laud_ce91.html" title="William Laud">William Laud</a>. Under <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Protectorate_1120.html" title="The Protectorate">the Protectorate</a> of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_of_England_2192.html" title="Commonwealth of England">Commonwealth of England</a> from <a href="../../../1/6/4/1649.html" title="1649">1649</a> to <a href="../../../1/6/6/1660.html" title="1660">1660</a>, Anglicanism was <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disestablishmentarianism.html" title="Disestablishmentarianism">disestablished</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presbyterian.html" title="Presbyterian">presbyterian</a> <a href="../../../e/c/c/Ecclesiology.html" title="Ecclesiology">ecclesiology</a> was introduced as an adjunct to the episcopal system, the Articles were replaced with the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westminster_Confession_d687.html" title="Westminster Confession">Westminster Confession</a>, and the Book of Common Prayer was replaced by the <a href="../../../d/i/r/Directory_of_Public_Worship_cea2.html" title="Directory of Public Worship">Directory of Public Worship</a>. Despite this, about one quarter of English clergy refused to conform.</p>
<p>With the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Restoration_df9a.html" title="English Restoration">Restoration</a> of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_II_of_England_f8dd.html" title="Charles II of England">Charles II</a>, Anglicanism too was restored in a form not far removed from the Elizabethan version. One difference was that the ideal of encompassing all the people of England in one religious organisation, taken for granted by the <a href="../../../t/u/d/Tudor_dynasty.html" title="Tudor dynasty">Tudors</a>, had to be abandoned. The religious landscape of England assumed its present form, with an Anglican established church occupying the middle ground, and Roman Catholics and those Puritans who dissented from the establishment, too strong to be suppressed altogether, having to continue their existence outside the national church rather than controlling it. Restrictions and continuing official suspicion with some persecution continued well into the nineteenth century. The Elizabethan Settlement failed in that it was never able to win the assent of the entire English people, let alone the other peoples of the British Isles. Yet as the Anglican form of Christianity is now found all over the world it may possibly have succeeded beyond the wildest expectations of anybody alive in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.</p>

<p>The history of Anglicanism since the <a href="../../../1/7/t/17th_century.html" title="17th century">17th century</a> has been one of greater geographical and cultural expansion and diversity, accompanied by a concomitant diversity of liturgical and theological profession and practice.</p>
<p>At the same time as the English reformation, the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Ireland_72de.html" title="Church of Ireland">Church of Ireland</a> was also separated from Rome and adopted articles of faith similar to England's Thirty-Nine Articles. However, unlike England, the Anglican church there was never able to capture the loyalty of the majority of the population (who still adhered to Roman Catholicism). As early as 1582, the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Episcopal_Church_03b9.html" title="Scottish Episcopal Church">Scottish Episcopal Church</a> was inaugurated when <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_VI_of_Scotland_22b9.html" title="James VI of Scotland">James VI of Scotland</a> sought to reintroduce bishops when the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Scotland_1b71.html" title="Church of Scotland">Church of Scotland</a> became fully <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presbyterian.html" title="Presbyterian">presbyterian</a> (see <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_reformation.html" title="Scottish reformation">Scottish reformation</a>). The Scottish Episcopal Church enabled the creation of the <a href="../../../e/p/i/Episcopal_Church_in_the_United_States_of_America_dc8c.html" title="Episcopal Church in the United States of America">Episcopal Church in the United States of America</a> after the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Revolution_bd44.html" title="American Revolution">American Revolution</a>, by consecrating in <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeen.html" title="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a> the first American bishop, <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Seabury_df37.html" title="Samuel Seabury">Samuel Seabury</a>, who had been refused consecration by bishops in England, due to his inability to take the oath of allegiance to the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_crown.html" title="English crown">English crown</a> prescribed in the Order for the Consecration of Bishops. The polity and ecclesiology of the Scottish and American churches, as well as their daughter churches, thus tends to be distinct from those spawned by the English church - reflected, for example, in their looser conception of <a href="../../../e/c/c/Ecclesiastical_province.html" title="Ecclesiastical province">provincial</a> government, and their leadership by a <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presiding_bishop.html" title="Presiding bishop">presiding bishop</a> or <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primus.html" title="Primus">primus</a> rather than by a <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolitan.html" title="Metropolitan">metropolitan</a> or <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishop.html" title="Archbishop">archbishop</a>.

<p>At the time of the Reformation the four (now six) Welsh dioceses were all part of the Province of Canterbury, and remained so until 1920 when the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_in_Wales_2668.html" title="Church in Wales">Church in Wales</a> was created as a province of the Anglican Communion. The intense interest in the Christian faith which characterised the Welsh in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was not present in the sixteenth, and most Welsh people went along with the Reformation more because the English government was strong enough to impose its wishes in Wales, rather than out of any real conviction.</p>
<p>Anglicanism spread outside of the British Isles by means of emigration as well as missionary effort. English missionary organisations such as <a href="../../../u/s/p/USPG_96ef.html" title="USPG">USPG</a> - then known as the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Society_for_the_Propagation_of_the_Gospel_in_Foreign_Parts_cc26.html" title="Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts">Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts</a>, the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Society_for_the_Promotion_of_Christian_Knowledge_7467.html" title="Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge">Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge</a> (SPCK) and the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_Missionary_Society_5444.html" title="Church Missionary Society">Church Missionary Society</a> (CMS) were established in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to bring Anglican Christianity to the British colonies. By the nineteenth century, such missions were extended to other areas of the world. The liturgical and theological orientations of these missionary organisations were diverse. The SPG, for example, was influenced by the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_Revival_9c31.html" title="Catholic Revival">Catholic Revival</a> in the Church of England, while CMS was influenced by the <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evangelicalism.html" title="Evangelicalism">Evangelicalism</a> of the earlier Evangelical Revival. As a result, the piety, liturgy, and polity of the indigenous churches they established came to reflect these diverse orientations.</p>
<p>The growth of the twin "revivals" in nineteenth century Anglicanism - Evangelical and Catholic - were hugely influential. The Evangelical Revival informed important social movements such as <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abolitionism.html" title="Abolitionism">the abolition of slavery</a>, child welfare legislation, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prohibition.html" title="Prohibition">prohibition</a> of alcohol, the development of <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_health.html" title="Public health">public health</a> and <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_education.html" title="Public education">public education</a>. It also led to the creation of the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_Army_d822.html" title="Church Army">Church Army</a>, an evangelical and social welfare association and informed piety and liturgy, most notably in the development of <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodism.html" title="Methodism">Methodism</a>. The Catholic Revival, arguably, had a more penetrating impact. It succeeded in transforming the liturgy of the Anglican Church, repositioning the <a href="../../../e/u/c/Eucharist.html" title="Eucharist">Eucharist</a> as the central act of worship in place of the <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_office.html" title="Daily office">daily offices</a>, and reintroducing the use of vestments, ceremonial, and acts of piety (such as <a href="../../../e/u/c/Eucharistic_adoration.html" title="Eucharistic adoration">Eucharistic adoration</a>) that had long been prohibited in the English church and (to a certain extent) in its daughter churches. It also had an impact on Anglican theology, through John Henry Newman, Philip Pusey, and the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_socialism.html" title="Christian socialism">Christian socialism</a> of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Gore_2118.html" title="Charles Gore">Charles Gore</a>, as well as influencing other non-tractarian figures such as FD Maurice .</p>

<p>Contrary to popular misconception, the British monarch is not the constitutional "Head" but in law "The Supreme Governor" of the Church of England, nor does he or she have any role in provinces outside England and Wales. The role of the crown in the Church of England is practically limited to the appointment of bishops, including the Archbishop of Canterbury. This process is accomplished through collaboration with and consent of ecclesial representatives <i>(see <a href="../../../e/c/c/Ecclesiastical_Commissioners_c3c4.html" title="Ecclesiastical Commissioners">Ecclesiastical Commissioners</a>)</i>. The monarch has no constitutional role in Anglican churches in other parts of the world, although the prayer books of several countries where she is head of state maintain prayers for her as sovereign.</p>
<p>A characteristic of Anglicanism is that it has no international juridical authority. All thirty-nine provinces of the Anglican Communion are independent, each with their own <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primate_%28religion%29.html" title="Primate (religion)">primate</a> and governing structure. These provinces may take the form of national churches (such as in Canada, Uganda, or Japan) or a collection of nations (such as the West Indies, Central Africa, or South Asia), or geographical regions (such as Vanuatu and Solomon Islands) etc. Within these Communion provinces may exist subdivisions called <a href="../../../e/c/c/Ecclesiastical_province.html" title="Ecclesiastical province">ecclesiastical provinces</a>, under the jurisdiction of a <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolitan.html" title="Metropolitan">metropolitan</a>. All provinces of the Anglican Communion consist of <a href="../../../d/i/o/Diocese.html" title="Diocese">dioceses</a>, each under the jurisdiction of a <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop.html" title="Bishop">bishop</a>. In the Anglican tradition, bishops must be consecrated according to the strictures of <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostolic_succession.html" title="Apostolic succession">apostolic succession</a>, which Anglicans consider one of the marks of <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholicism.html" title="Catholicism">catholicity</a>. Apart from bishops, there are two other orders of ordained ministry: <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deacon.html" title="Deacon">deacon</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priest.html" title="Priest">priest</a>. No requirement is made for <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clerical_celibacy.html" title="Clerical celibacy">clerical celibacy</a> and women may be ordained as deacons in almost all provinces, as priests in some, and as bishops in a few provinces. <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican_religious_order.html" title="Anglican religious order">Anglican religious orders</a> and communities, suppressed in England during the Reformation, have re-emerged since the mid-nineteenth century, and now have an international presence and influence.</p>
<p>Government in the Anglican Communion is <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synod.html" title="Synod">synodical</a>, consisting of three houses of <a href="../../../l/a/i/Laity.html" title="Laity">laity</a> (usually elected parish representatives), <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clergy.html" title="Clergy">clergy</a>, and bishops. National, provincial, and diocesan synods maintain different scopes of authority, depending on their <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canon_law.html" title="Canon law">canons and constitutions</a>. Anglicanism is not <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congregationalism.html" title="Congregationalism">congregational</a> in its polity: It is the diocese, not the parish church, which is the smallest unit of authority in the church, and bishops must give their assent to resolutions passed by synods. <i>(See <a href="../../../e/p/i/Episcopal_polity.html" title="Episcopal polity">Episcopal polity</a>).</i></p>

<p>The Anglican Communion has no international juridical organisation. All international bodies are consultative and collaborative, and their resolutions are not legally binding on the independent provinces of the Communion. There are three international bodies of note.</p>
<ol>
<li>The <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lambeth_Conference_0b82.html" title="Lambeth Conference">Lambeth Conference</a> is the oldest international consultation.

<p>In the Indian subcontinent most Anglican churches have entered into formal union with Protestant denominations while remaining part of the Anglican Communion. These agreements, which date from the <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940s.html" title="1940s">1940s</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a>, led to the creation of the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_North_India_7ce8.html" title="Church of North India">Church of North India</a>, the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_South_India_5e7f.html" title="Church of South India">Church of South India</a>, the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Pakistan_ceee.html" title="Church of Pakistan">Church of Pakistan</a> and the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Bangladesh_868b.html" title="Church of Bangladesh">Church of Bangladesh</a>.

As a percentage of the total population in the region, these united churches are not significant, but aside from <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangladesh.html" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>, they are numerically very substantial.</p>
<p>Those which did not join with the union agreements in South Asia retained the name Anglican Church of India or adopted a similar one using the word "Anglican." The total membership of these churches has been estimated at 800,000. Most have recently entered into communion with churches of the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continuing_Anglican_Movement_af29.html" title="Continuing Anglican Movement">Continuing Anglican Movement</a> and have North American parishes.</p>

<p>There are a number of jurisdictions which identify themselves as "Anglican" but are not in communion with Canterbury. They therefore are outside the Anglican Communion. Several, such as the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_Church_of_England_8e3e.html" title="Free Church of England">Free Church of England</a> and the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reformed_Episcopal_Church_1cf1.html" title="Reformed Episcopal Church">Reformed Episcopal Church</a> in the United States left the Anglican Communion in the <a href="../../../1/8/0/1800s.html" title="1800s">1800s</a> in reaction to the inroads of the Catholic Revival and the controversy over <a href="../../../r/i/t/Ritualism.html" title="Ritualism">ritualism</a> which it produced in the church.</p>
<p>Later, during the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a>, disagreements with certain provincial bodies — chiefly in <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a> and in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> — over such issues as prayer book revision, the remarriage of divorced persons, the <a href="../../../o/r/d/Ordination_of_women.html" title="Ordination of women">ordination of women</a>, and the acceptance by the church of <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexual.html" title="Homosexual">homosexual</a> relationships led to another and quite different schism. These Anglican churches are usually termed "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Continuing_Anglican_Movement_af29.html" title="Continuing Anglican Movement">Continuing Anglican churches</a>" because of their determination to preserve (or "continue") the episcopate in <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostolic_Succession_e4cf.html" title="Apostolic Succession">Apostolic Succession</a>, as well as the faith, worship and teaching of traditional Anglicanism and historical Christianity which they believe the Anglican Communion to have deviated from. The older Reformed Episcopal churches maintained the lineage of bishops without accepting the idea that sacraments are valid only if administered by clergy in such a lineage.</p>
<p>There are also independent jurisdictions unrelated to the preceding schisms. The <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_England_in_South_Africa_9499.html" title="Church of England in South Africa">Church of England in South Africa</a> is conservative, long-established, and has a substantial membership. It is separate from the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican_Church_of_Southern_Africa_2379.html" title="Anglican Church of Southern Africa">Anglican Church of Southern Africa</a>, which is part of the Anglican Communion. Other churches, however, have adopted the Anglican name, the Book of Common Prayer, Anglican vestments, and — in some cases — the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thirty-Nine_Articles_3b7d.html" title="Thirty-Nine Articles">Thirty Nine Articles of Religion</a>, but have no historic connection to the Anglican Communion. Unlike the socially conservative Continuing Anglican churches and the Church of England in South Africa, some of these tiny jurisdictions are openly oriented towards the Gay and Lesbian community and do ordain women clergy.</p>
<p>Given the range of concerns and the grounds for schism, there is as much diversity in the theological and liturgical orientations of the Free Churches, the Continuing Anglican churches, and the independent Anglican bodies as there is among churches of the Anglican Communion. Some are Evangelical, others charismatic and Evangelical, and yet others are <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Catholic_1507.html" title="Anglo-Catholic">Anglo-Catholic</a>. What they have in common is a conviction that mainstream Anglicanism in North America, the United Kingdom, and elsewhere has departed from acceptable principles of belief and/or practice.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglicanism.html" title="Edit section: Catholic and Reformed">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Catholic and Reformed</span></h3>
<p>In the time of Henry VIII rather than theological disagreement, the origin of Anglicanism was based on questions of jurisdiction - namely, the belief of the Crown that national churches should be autonomous. The effort to create a national church in legal continuity with its traditions, but inclusive of the doctrinal and liturgical belief of the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reformers.html" title="Reformers">Reformers</a> was joined by a real concern to make the institution as hospitable as possible to people of different theological inclinations, so as to maintain social peace and cohesion. The result has been a movement with a distinctive self-image among Christian movements. The question often arises whether the Anglican Communion should be identified as a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant.html" title="Protestant">Protestant</a> or <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> church, or perhaps a distinct branch of Christianity altogether.</p>
<p>The distinction between Protestant and Catholic, and the coherence of the two, is routinely a matter of debate both within specific Anglican Churches and throughout the Anglican Communion by members themselves. Since the <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_Movement_bf89.html" title="Oxford Movement">Oxford Movement</a> of the mid-19th century, many churches of the Communion have embraced and extended liturgical and pastoral practices dissimilar to most Reformed Protestant theology. This extends beyond the ceremony of <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Church_593a.html" title="High Church">High Church</a> services to even more theologically significant territory, such as sacramental theology (see <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican_sacraments.html" title="Anglican sacraments">Anglican sacraments</a>). Nevertheless, while Anglo-Catholic practices, particularly liturgical ones, have become much more mainstream within the denomination over the last century, there remain many areas where practices and beliefs remain on the more Protestant or Evangelical side.</p>

<p>Unlike other Christian movements, Anglican doctrine is neither established by a <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magisterium.html" title="Magisterium">magisterium</a>, nor derived from the theology of an <a href="../../../e/p/o/Eponymous.html" title="Eponymous">eponymous</a> founder (such as <a href="../../../l/u/t/Lutheranism.html" title="Lutheranism">Lutheranism</a> or <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calvinism.html" title="Calvinism">Calvinism</a>), nor summed up in a confession of faith (beyond those of the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creed.html" title="Creed">creeds</a>). Instead, the earliest Anglican theological documents are its prayer books, which were themselves the products of profound theological reflection and compromise. It is within the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Common_Prayer_9e7e.html" title="Book of Common Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a> that Anglican doctrine was originally expressed in the selection, arrangement, and composition of prayers and exhortations, the selection and arrangement of daily scripture readings (the <a href="../../../l/e/c/Lectionary.html" title="Lectionary">lectionary</a>), and in the stipulation of the <a href="../../../r/u/b/Rubric.html" title="Rubric">rubrics</a> for permissible <a href="../../../l/i/t/Liturgy.html" title="Liturgy">liturgical action</a> and any variations in the prayers and exhortations. The principle of looking to the prayer books as a guide to the parameters of belief and practice is called by the Latin name <i><a href="../../../l/e/x/Lex_orandi%2C_lex_credendi.html" title="Lex orandi, lex credendi">lex orandi, lex credendi</a></i> ("the law of prayer is the law of belief"). Within the prayer books are the so-called fundamentals of Anglican doctrine: The <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostles%27_Creed_d1e6.html" title="Apostles' Creed">Apostles'</a> and <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicene_Creed_e8a2.html" title="Nicene Creed">Nicene Creeds</a>, the scriptures (via the lectionary), the sacraments, daily prayer, the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catechism.html" title="Catechism">catechism</a>, and apostolic succession in the context of the historic threefold ministry.</p>
<p>Beyond the prayer books of various provinces, however, there are other important principles that have had an impact on Anglican belief. The earliest are contained within the <i><a href="../../../t/h/i/Thirty-Nine_Articles_3b7d.html" title="Thirty-Nine Articles">Thirty-Nine Articles</a> of Religion</i>, as they appear in their final, 1604 form. Historically, Anglican clergy had to take an oath of subscription to the Articles, although the practice has become uncommon. Despite this, they have never been considered binding, but rather advisory. The degree to which each of the articles has remained influential varies. Arguably, the most influential of them has been Article VI on the "sufficiency of Scripture," which states that "Scripture containeth all things necessary to salvation: so that whatsoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be required of any man, that it should be believed as an article of the Faith, or be thought requisite or necessary to salvation." This article has informed Anglican biblical <a href="../../../e/x/e/Exegesis.html" title="Exegesis">exegesis</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermeneutics.html" title="Hermeneutics">hermeneutics</a> since earliest times.</p>
<p>Anglicans also look for authority in their so-called "standard divines" (see below). Historically, the most influential of these - apart from Cranmer - has been the sixteenth century cleric and theologian <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Hooker_%28theologian%29_58fc.html" title="Richard Hooker (theologian)">Richard Hooker</a>. Hooker's description of Anglican authority as being derived primarily from Scripture, informed by reason (the intellect and the experience of God) and tradition (the practices and beliefs of the historical church), has influenced Anglican self-identity and doctrinal reflection perhaps more powerfully than any other formula. The analogy of the "three-legged stool" of scripture, reason and tradition is often incorrectly attributed to Hooker.</p>
<p>Finally, the extension of Anglicanism into non-English cultures, the growing diversity of prayer books, and the increasing interest in ecumenical dialogue has led to further reflection on the parameters of Anglican identity. Many Anglicans look to the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago-Lambeth_Quadrilateral_9355.html" title="Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral">Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral</a> of 1888 as the "<i>sine qua non</i>" of Communal identity. In brief, the Quadrilateral's four points are the Holy Scriptures, as containing all things necessary to salvation; the Creeds (specifically, the Apostles' and Nicene Creeds), as the sufficient statement of Christian faith; the dominical sacraments of <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptism.html" title="Baptism">Baptism</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Communion_f177.html" title="Holy Communion">Holy Communion</a>; and the historic <a href="../../../e/p/i/Episcopalian_church_governance.html" title="Episcopalian church governance">episcopate</a>,</p>

<p>Within the Anglican tradition, there have been certain theological writers whose works have been considered standards for faith, doctrine, worship, and spirituality. While there is no authoritative list of these Anglican divines, there are some whose names would likely be found on most lists - those who are commemorated in <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calendar_of_saints_%28Anglican%29_76b4.html" title="Calendar of saints (Anglican)">lesser feasts</a> of the Church, and those whose works are frequently <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthology.html" title="Anthology">anthologized</a>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>The corpus produced by Anglican divines is diverse. What they have in common is a commitment to the faith as conveyed by Scripture and the Book of Common Prayer, thus regarding prayer and theology in a manner akin to that of the <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostolic_Fathers_b839.html" title="Apostolic Fathers">Apostolic Fathers</a>.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> On the whole, Anglican divines view the <a href="../../../v/i/a/Via_media.html" title="Via media">via media</a> of Anglicanism, not as a compromise, but "a positive position, witnessing to the universality of God and God's kingdom working through the fallible, earthly <i>ecclesia Anglicana</i>."<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> These theologians regard Scripture as interpreted through tradition and reason as authoritative in matters concerning salvation. Reason and tradition, indeed, is extant in and presupposed by Scripture, thus implying co-operation between God and humanity, God and nature, and between the sacred and secular. Faith is thus regarded as <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incarnation.html" title="Incarnation">incarnational</a>, and authority as dispersed.</p>
<p>Among the early Anglican divines of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the names of Thomas Cranmer, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Jewel_2793.html" title="John Jewel">John Jewel</a>, Richard Hooker, <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lancelot_Andrewes_da02.html" title="Lancelot Andrewes">Lancelot Andrewes</a>, and <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jeremy_Taylor_1ea9.html" title="Jeremy Taylor">Jeremy Taylor</a> predominate. The influential character of Hooker's <i><a href="../../../o/f/_/Of_the_Laws_of_Ecclesiastical_Polity_40bc.html" title="Of the Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity">Of the Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity</a></i> cannot be overestimated. Published in 1593 and subsequently, Hooker's eight volume work is primarily a treatise on Church-state relations, but it also deals comprehensively with issues of <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_interpretation.html" title="Biblical interpretation">biblical interpretation</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/t/Soteriology.html" title="Soteriology">soteriology</a>, <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethics.html" title="Ethics">ethics</a>, and <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanctification.html" title="Sanctification">sanctification</a>. Throughout the work, Hooker makes clear that theology involves prayer and is concerned with ultimate issues, and also that theology is relevant to the social mission of the church.</p>
<p>The eighteenth century saw the rise of two important movements in Anglicanism: <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge_Platonists_eb34.html" title="Cambridge Platonists">Cambridge Platonism</a>, with its mystical understanding of reason as the "candle of the Lord," and the Evangelical Revival, with its emphasis on the personal experience of the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Spirit_e4ea.html" title="Holy Spirit">Holy Spirit</a>. The Cambridge Platonist movement evolved into a school called <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latitudinarianism.html" title="Latitudinarianism">Latitudinarianism</a>, which emphasized reason as the barometer of discernment and took a stance of indifference towards doctrinal and ecclesiological differences. The Evangelical Revival, influenced by such figures as <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Wesley_f66e.html" title="John Wesley">John Wesley</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Simeon_bcb3.html" title="Charles Simeon">Charles Simeon</a>, re-emphasized the importance of <a href="../../../s/o/l/Sola_fide.html" title="Sola fide">justification through faith</a> and the consequent importance of personal conversion. Some in this movement, such as Wesley and <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Whitefield_1456.html" title="George Whitefield">George Whitefield</a>, took the message to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, influencing the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Great_Awakening_00b3.html" title="First Great Awakening">First Great Awakening</a>, and also created an Anglo-American movement called <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodism.html" title="Methodism">Methodism</a> that would eventually break away, structurally, from the Anglican churches after the American Revolution.</p>
<p>By the nineteenth century, there was a renewed emphasis on the teachings of the earlier Anglican divines: Theologians such as <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Keble_1a7d.html" title="John Keble">John Keble</a>, <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Bouverie_Pusey_36cb.html" title="Edward Bouverie Pusey">Edward Bouverie Pusey</a>, and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Henry_Newman_8a57.html" title="John Henry Newman">John Henry Newman</a> had widespread influence in the realm of polemics, homiletics, and theological and devotional works. Their work is largely credited with the development of the <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_Movement_bf89.html" title="Oxford Movement">Oxford Movement</a>, which sought to reassert Catholic identity and practice in the Anglican Church. Through such works as <i>The Kingdom of Christ</i>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_Denison_Maurice_0b77.html" title="Frederick Denison Maurice">Frederick Denison Maurice</a> played a pivotal role in inaugurating another movement, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_socialism.html" title="Christian socialism">Christian socialism</a>. In this, Maurice transformed Hooker's emphasis on the <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incarnation.html" title="Incarnation">incarnational</a> nature of Anglican spirituality to an imperative for social justice. Also in the nineteenth century, Anglican biblical scholarship began to assume a distinct character, represented by the so-called "Cambridge triumvirate" of Joseph Lightfoot, F.J.A. Hort, and <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooke_Foss_Westcott_90d3.html" title="Brooke Foss Westcott">Brooke Foss Westcott</a>. Their orientation is best summed up by Lightfoot's observation that "Life which Christ is and which Christ communicates, the life which fills our whole beings as we realise its capacities, is active fellowship with God."</p>
<p>The twentieth century is marked by figures such as <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Gore_2118.html" title="Charles Gore">Charles Gore</a>, with his emphasis on natural revelation, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Temple_%28archbishop%29_0d8f.html" title="William Temple (archbishop)">William Temple</a>'s focus on Christianity and society, and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_A.T._Robinson_cbfe.html" title="John A.T. Robinson">J.A.T. Robinson</a>'s provocative discussions of deism and theism. Outside England, one sees such figures as <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Porcher_DuBose_e99a.html" title="William Porcher DuBose">William Porcher DuBose</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Meade_1164.html" title="William Meade">William Meade</a>, and Charles Henry Brent in the United States. More recently, theologians such as <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeffrey_John_30a8.html" title="Jeffrey John">Jeffrey John</a>, <a href="../../../n/2E/t/N.T._Wright_f2e6.html" title="N.T. Wright">N.T.

<p>"Churchmanship" can be defined as the manifestation of theology in the realms of liturgy, piety, and - to some extent - spirituality. In Anglicanism diversity in this respect has tended to reflect the diversity in the movement's Protestant and Catholic identity. Different individuals, groups, parishes, dioceses, and provinces may identify more with one or the other, or some balance of the two.</p>
<p>The range of Anglican belief and practice became particularly divisive during the 19th century when some clergy were disciplined and even imprisoned on charges of <a href="../../../r/i/t/Ritualism.html" title="Ritualism">ritualism</a> while, at the same time, others were criticized for engaging in public worship services with ministers of Reformed churches. Resistance to the growing acceptance of Catholic ceremonial by the mainstream of Anglicanism and ultimately led to the formation of small breakaway churches such as the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_Church_of_England_8e3e.html" title="Free Church of England">Free Church of England</a> in England (1844) and the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reformed_Episcopal_Church_1cf1.html" title="Reformed Episcopal Church">Reformed Episcopal Church</a> in North America (1873).</p>
<p>Anglo-Catholic (and some Broad Church) Anglicans undertake public liturgy in a fashion that resembles that of the contemporary Roman Catholic Church, in sometimes an even more traditional manner (e.g., an "eastward orientation" at the altar). The Eucharist may be conducted by priest, deacon, and <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subdeacon.html" title="Subdeacon">subdeacon</a> dressed in their traditional vestments, using incense and <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanctus_bell.html" title="Sanctus bell">sanctus bells</a>, and with "secret prayers" said by the presiding celebrant. Such churches may practice <a href="../../../e/u/c/Eucharistic_adoration.html" title="Eucharistic adoration">Eucharistic adoration</a>, such as solemn benediction of the reserved sacrament. In terms of personal piety, such Anglicans may recite the <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosary.html" title="Rosary">rosary</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angelus.html" title="Angelus">angelus</a>, be involved in a devotional society dedicated to "Our Lady" (the <a href="../../../b/l/e/Blessed_Virgin_Mary_7f1f.html" title="Blessed Virgin Mary">Blessed Virgin Mary</a>), and seek the intercession of the saints. In recent years, prayer books of several provinces have, out of deference to a greater agreement with Eastern <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conciliarism.html" title="Conciliarism">Conciliarism</a> (and a perceived greater respect accorded Anglicanism by Eastern Orthodoxy than by Roman Catholicism), instituted a number of historically Eastern and <a href="../../../o/r/i/Oriental_Orthodox_4ce0.html" title="Oriental Orthodox">Oriental Orthodox</a> elements in their liturgies, including introduction of the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trisagion.html" title="Trisagion">Trisagion</a> and deletion of the <a href="../../../f/i/l/Filioque.html" title="Filioque">filioque</a> clause from the <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicene_Creed_e8a2.html" title="Nicene Creed">Nicene Creed</a>.</p>
<p>For their part, those <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evangelicalism.html" title="Evangelicalism">Evangelical</a> (and some Broad Church) Anglicans who emphasise the Protestant nature of the Church stress the Reformation theme of <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salvation.html#Christian_views_of_salvation" title="Salvation">salvation</a> by grace through faith. They emphasize the two dominical sacraments of Baptism and Eucharist, viewing the other five as "lesser rites." Such Anglicans tend to take the inerrancy of Scripture literally, adopting the view of Article VI that it contains all things necessary to salvation in an explicit sense. Worship in churches influenced by these principles tends to be significantly less elaborate, with greater emphasis on the Liturgy of the Word (the reading of the scriptures, the sermon, and the intercessory prayers). The Order for Holy Communion may be celebrated bi-weekly or monthly (in preference to the <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_office.html" title="Daily office">daily offices</a>), by ministers attired in <a href="../../../c/h/o/Choir_habit.html" title="Choir habit">choir habit</a> or more regular clothes, rather than Eucharistic vestments. Ceremony may be in keeping with their view of the provisions of the <a href="../../../o/r/n/Ornaments_Rubric_453f.html" title="Ornaments Rubric">Ornaments Rubric</a> of the historic English prayer books — no candles, no incense, no bells, and a minimum of manual action by the presiding celebrant (such as touching the elements at the <a href="../../../w/o/r/Words_of_Institution_74e4.html" title="Words of Institution">Words of Institution</a>).</p>
<p>In recent years, there has been a surge of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charismatic_Movement_2d1b.html" title="Charismatic Movement">charismatic</a> worship among Anglicans. Both Anglo-Catholics and Evangelicals have been affected by this movement such that it is not uncommon to find typically charismatic postures, music, and other themes evident during the services of otherwise Anglo-Catholic or Evangelical parishes.</p>
<p>The spectrum of Anglican beliefs and practice is too large to be fit into these labels. Many Anglicans locate themselves somewhere in the spectrum of the Broad Church tradition, and consider themselves an amalgam of Evangelical and Catholic. Such Anglicans stress that Anglicanism is the "<i><a href="../../../v/i/a/Via_media.html" title="Via media">via media</a></i>" (middle way) between the two major strains of Western Christianity. <i>Via media</i> may also be understood as underscoring Anglicanism's preference for a communitarian and methodological approach to theological issues rather than relativism.</p>
<p><a name="Social_issues" id="Social_issues"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglicanism.html" title="Edit section: Social issues">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Social issues</span></h2>
<p>Anglican concern with broader issues of social justice can be traced to its earliest divines. Richard Hooker, for instance, wrote that "God hath created nothing simply for itself, but each thing in all things, and of every thing each part in other have such interest, that in the whole world nothing is found whereunto any thing created can say, 'I need thee not.'" This, and related statements reflect the deep thread of <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incarnation.html" title="Incarnation">incarnational theology</a> running through Anglican social thought - a theology which sees God, nature, and humanity in dynamic interaction, and the interpenetration of the secular and the sacred in the make-up of the cosmos. Such theology is informed by a traditional English spiritual ethos, rooted in Celtic Christianity, and reinforced by Anglicanism's origins as an <a href="../../../e/s/t/Established_church.html" title="Established church">established church</a>, bound up by its structure in the life and interests of civil society.</p>
<p>Repeatedly, throughout Anglican history, this principle has reasserted itself in movements of social justice. For instance, in the eighteenth century the influential Evangelical Anglican <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Wilberforce_04a9.html" title="William Wilberforce">William Wilberforce</a>, along with others, campaigned against the slave trade. In the nineteenth century, the dominant issues concerned the adverse effects of industrialisation. Frederick Denison Maurice was a leading figure advocating reform in this respect, founding so-called "producer's co-operatives" and the Working Men's College. His work, instrumental in the establishment of the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_socialism.html" title="Christian socialism">Christian socialist</a> movement, influenced later Anglo-Catholics such as Charles Gore, who wrote that "the principle of the incarnation is denied unless the Christian spirit can be allowed to concern itself with everything that interests and touches human life." Anglican focus on labour issues culminated in the work of <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Temple_fc45.html" title="William Temple">William Temple</a> in the <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940s.html" title="1940s">1940s</a>.</p>
<p>A question of whether or not Christianity is a pacifist religion has remained a matter of debate for Anglicans. In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1937.html" title="1937">1937</a>, the Anglican Pacifist Fellowship emerged as a distinct reform organisation, seeking to make pacifism a clearly defined part of Anglican theology. The group rapidly gained popularity amongst Anglican intellectuals, including <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vera_Brittain_b4d4.html" title="Vera Brittain">Vera Brittain</a>, <a href="../../../e/v/e/Evelyn_Underhill_0e82.html" title="Evelyn Underhill">Evelyn Underhill</a> and former British political leader <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Lansbury_537b.html" title="George Lansbury">George Lansbury</a>. Furthermore, Reverend <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Sheppard_ef61.html" title="Dick Sheppard">Dick Sheppard</a>, who during the <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a> was one of Britain's most famous Anglican priests due to his landmark sermon broadcasts for <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio.html" title="Radio">radio</a>, founded the <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peace_Pledge_Union_8108.html" title="Peace Pledge Union">Peace Pledge Union</a> a <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secular.html" title="Secular">secular</a> pacifist organisation for the non-religious that garnered massive support throughout the <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a>.</p>
<p>Whilst never actively endorsed by the Anglican Church, many Anglicans unofficially have adopted the Augustinian "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Just_War_Theory_f72f.html" title="The Just War Theory">Just War</a>" doctrine. The Anglican Pacifist Fellowship remain highly active throughout the Anglican world. It rejects this doctrine of "just war" and seeks to reform the Church by reintroducing the <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacifism.html" title="Pacifism">pacifism</a> inherent in the beliefs of many of the earliest Christians and present in their interpretation of Christ's <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sermon_on_the_Mount_69ef.html" title="Sermon on the Mount">Sermon on the Mount</a>.</p>
<p>Confusing the matter was the fact that the 37th Article of Religion in the Book of Common Prayer states that "it is lawful for Christian men, at the commandment of the Magistrate, to wear weapons, and serve in the wars." Therefore, the Lambeth Council in the modern era has sought to provide a clearer position by repudiating modern war and developed a statement that has been affirmed at each subsequent meeting of the Council. This statement was also strongly reasserted when "the 67th General Convention of the Episcopal Church reaffirms the statement made by the Anglican Bishops assembled at Lambeth in 1978 and adopted by the 66th General Convention of the Episcopal Church in 1979, calling “Christian people everywhere ... to engage themselves in non-violent action for justice and peace and to support others so engaged, recognizing that such action will be controversial and may be personally very costly... this General Convention, in obedience to this call, urges all members of this Church to support by prayer and by such other means as they deem appropriate, those who engaged in such non-violent action, and particularly those who suffer for conscience' sake as a result; and be it further Resolved, that this General Convention calls upon all members of this Church seriously to consider the implications for their own lives of this call to resist war and work for peace for their own lives."</p>

<p>The focus on other social issues became increasingly diffuse after the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_World_War_e58d.html" title="Second World War">Second World War</a>. On the one hand, the growing independence and strength of Anglican churches in the global south brought new emphasis to issues of global poverty, the inequitable distribution of resources, and the lingering effects of colonialism. In this regard, figures such as <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desmond_Tutu_a927.html" title="Desmond Tutu">Desmond Tutu</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/d/Ted_Scott_985f.html" title="Ted Scott">Ted Scott</a> were instrumental in mobilising Anglicans worldwide against the <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">apartheid</a> policies of <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>. On the other hand, rapid social change in the industrialised world during the twentieth century compelled the church to examine issues of gender, sexuality, and marriage.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>This led to Lambeth resolutions countenancing <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contraception.html" title="Contraception">contraception</a> and the remarriage of divorced persons. It also led to most provinces approving the <a href="../../../o/r/d/Ordination_of_women.html" title="Ordination of women">ordination of women</a>. More recently, it has led some jurisdictions to permit the ordination of individuals in same-sex relationships and to authorise rites for the blessing of same-sex unions. More conservative elements within Anglicanism (primarily African churches and factions within North American Anglicanism) are opposed to these changes. Some liberal and moderate Anglicans see this opposition as representing a new <a href="../../../f/u/n/Fundamentalism.html" title="Fundamentalism">fundamentalism</a> within Anglicanism. The lack of social consensus among and within provinces of diverse cultural traditions has resulted in considerable conflict and even schism concerning some or all of these developments.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>These latter trends reflect a countervailing tendency in Anglicanism towards insularity, reinforced perhaps by the "big tent" nature of the movement, which seeks to be comprehensive of various views and tendencies. The insularity and complacency of the early established <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_England_2cc6.html" title="Church of England">Church of England</a> has tended to influence Anglican self-identity, and inhibit engagement with the broader society in favour of internal debate and dialogue. Nonetheless, there is significantly greater cohesion among Anglicans when they turn their attention outward. Anglicans worldwide are active in many areas of social and environmental concern.</p>

<p>A small yet influential aspect of Anglicanism is its <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican_religious_order.html" title="Anglican religious order">religious orders</a> and communities. Shortly after the beginning of the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_Revival_9c31.html" title="Catholic Revival">Catholic Revival</a> in the Church of England, there was a renewal of interest in re-establishing religious and monastic orders and communities. One of Henry VIII's earliest acts was their dissolution and seizure of their assets. In <a href="../../../1/8/4/1841.html" title="1841">1841</a> Marion Rebecca Hughes became the first woman to take the vows of religion in communion with the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Province_of_Canterbury_9ed0.html" title="Province of Canterbury">Province of Canterbury</a> since the Reformation. In <a href="../../../1/8/4/1848.html" title="1848">1848</a>, Priscilla Lydia Sellon became the superior of the Society of the Most Holy Trinity at Devonport, the first organised religious order. Sellon is called "the restorer, after three centuries, of the religious life in the Church of England."<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup> For the next one hundred years, religious orders for both men and women proliferated throughout the world, becoming a numerically small but disproportionately influential feature of global Anglicanism.</p>
<p>Anglican religious life at one time boasted hundreds of orders and communities, and thousands of <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious.html" title="Religious">religious</a>. An important aspect of Anglican religious life is that most communities of both men and women lived their lives consecrated to <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> under the <a href="../../../v/o/w/Vow.html" title="Vow">vows</a> of <a href="../../../p/o/v/Poverty.html" title="Poverty">poverty</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_abstinence.html" title="Sexual abstinence">chastity</a> and <a href="../../../o/b/e/Obedience.html" title="Obedience">obedience</a> (or in <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benedictine.html" title="Benedictine">Benedictine</a> communities, Stability, Conversion of Life, and Obedience) by practising a mixed life of reciting the full eight services of the <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breviary.html" title="Breviary">Breviary</a> in choir, along with a daily <a href="../../../e/u/c/Eucharist.html" title="Eucharist">Eucharist</a>, plus service to the poor. The mixed life, combining aspects of the contemplative orders and the active orders remains to this day a hallmark of Anglican religious life. Another distinctive feature of Anglican religious life is the existence of some mixed-gender communities.</p>
<p>Since the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> there has been a sharp decline in the number of professed religious in most parts of the Anglican Communion, especially in <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a>, <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>, and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>. Many once large and international communities have been reduced to a single convent or monastery comprised of elderly men or women. In the last few decades of the <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a>, novices have for most communities been few and far between. Some orders and communities have already become extinct. There are however, still several thousand Anglican religious working today in approximately 200 communities around the world, and religious life in many parts of the Communion - especially in developing nations - flourishes.</p>
<p>The most significant growth has been in the <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melanesia.html" title="Melanesia">Melanesian</a> countries of the <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solomon_Islands_abc3.html" title="Solomon Islands">Solomon Islands</a>, <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanuatu.html" title="Vanuatu">Vanuatu</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papua_New_Guinea_eb0d.html" title="Papua New Guinea">Papua New Guinea</a>.

Other communities of religious have been started by Anglicans in Papua New Guinea and in Vanuatu. Most Melanesian Anglican religious are in their early to mid 20s — vows may be temporary and it is generally assumed that brothers, at least, will leave and marry in due course — making the average age 40 to 50 years younger than their brothers and sisters in other countries.

<p>Anglican interest in <a href="../../../e/c/u/Ecumenism.html" title="Ecumenism">ecumenical</a> dialogue can be traced to the rise of the Oxford Movement, with its concern on reunion of the churches of "Catholic confession." This desire to work towards full <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communion_%28Christian%29_b4d0.html" title="Communion (Christian)">communion</a> with other denominations led to the development of the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago-Lambeth_Quadrilateral_9355.html" title="Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral">Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral</a>, approved by the Third Lambeth Conference of 1888. The four points (the sufficiency of scripture, the historic creeds, the two dominical sacraments, and the historic episcopate) were proposed as a basis for discussion, although they have frequently been taken as a non-negotiable bottom-line for reunion.</p>

<p>The second concerns dialogue with the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>. Long-term hostility between the two Communions was engendered by resistance among some English to the declaration of <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_supremacy.html" title="Royal supremacy">royal supremacy</a>, the confiscation of Church properties, the dissolution of the monasteries, the execution of priests and forced attendance at Anglican worship. There was a brief restoration of communion with Rome during the reign of Mary I. Her death marked the end of Catholic attempts to reconcile by law the English Church to Rome. Subsequently, <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Pius_V_cc8c.html" title="Pope Pius V">Pope Pius V</a>'s excommunication of Elizabeth I in 1570 and authorisation of rebellion against her contributed to official suspicion of the allegiances of English Catholics. This, combined with a desire to assert the claims of the established church, led to the promulgation of restrictive laws against their civil and religious rights. Elizabethan era restrictions were only relieved through several legislative reforms in the 19th century, cumulatively known as <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_Emancipation_5e59.html" title="Catholic Emancipation">Catholic Emancipation</a>. The last restriction on Catholics excluding them, and those who marry them from the Throne of the United Kingdom (and by extension the other <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_Realms_2bc3.html" title="Commonwealth Realms">Commonwealth Realms</a>) remains in effect.</p>
<p>In 1896 <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Leo_XIII_c277.html" title="Pope Leo XIII">Pope Leo XIII</a> issued <i><a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostolicae_Curae_b407.html" title="Apostolicae Curae">Apostolicae Curae</a></i> rejecting the Anglo-Catholic claims of the <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_Movement_bf89.html" title="Oxford Movement">Oxford Movement</a> and the Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral such as apostolic succession. In it the pope declared Anglican orders "absolutely null and utterly void." Despite the agreement reached by the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican_Roman_Catholic_International_Commission_3b94.html" title="Anglican Roman Catholic International Commission">Anglican Roman Catholic International Commission</a> (ARCIC) on the doctrine of the ministry in their <a href="http://www.prounione.urbe.it/dia-int/arcic/doc/e_arcic_elucid_min.html" class="external text" title="http://www.prounione.urbe.it/dia-int/arcic/doc/e_arcic_elucid_min.html" rel="nofollow"><i>Elucidation</i> of 1979</a>, this judgement was reaffirmed by Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, now <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Benedict_XVI_f9c4.html" title="Pope Benedict XVI">Pope Benedict XVI</a>, when he asserted <i>Apostolicae Curae</i> as an example of the infallible teaching office of the Catholic Church.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Some attempts at dialogue began in 1915, when Pope <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benedict_XV_c23f.html" title="Benedict XV">Benedict XV</a> approved a British Legation to the Vatican, led by an Anglican with a Catholic deputy. However, discussion of potential reunion in the 'Malines Conversations' eventually collapsed in 1925. Continued efforts resulted in the spread of the <a href="../../../w/e/e/Week_of_Prayer_for_Christian_Unity_8c8f.html" title="Week of Prayer for Christian Unity">Week of Prayer for Christian Unity</a> in both churches (and others), and the visit of <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Bell_%28bishop%29_8acd.html" title="George Bell (bishop)">George Bell</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_of_Chichester_8d14.html" title="Bishop of Chichester">Bishop of Chichester</a>, to Cardinal Montini of Milan, later Pope <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_VI_0ee4.html" title="Paul VI">Paul VI</a>.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Real rapprochement was not achieved until the warming of Catholic attitudes to ecumenism under the leadership of Pope <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_XXIII_e324.html" title="John XXIII">John XXIII</a>, whose foundation of the "<a href="../../../p/o/n/Pontifical_Council_for_Promoting_Christian_Unity_3a8a.html" title="Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity">Secretariat for the Promotion of Christian Unity</a>" encouraged Archbishop <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoffrey_Fisher_1438.html" title="Geoffrey Fisher">Geoffrey Fisher</a> to make a historic, though not entirely official, visit to the Vatican in 1960.

In 1966, Archbishop <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Ramsey_b1a7.html" title="Michael Ramsey">Michael Ramsey</a> made an official visit to <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Paul_VI_4529.html" title="Pope Paul VI">Pope Paul VI</a>, and in the following year, the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican-Roman_Catholic_International_Commission_efa5.html" title="Anglican-Roman Catholic International Commission">Anglican-Roman Catholic International Commission</a> was established. Its first project focused on the authority of Scripture, and the Commission has since produced nine agreed statements. Phase One of ARCIC ended in 1981 with the publication of a final report, <i>Elucidations on Authority in the Church</i>. Phase Two has been ongoing since 1983. The most recent agreed statement dealt with Marian theology, and was published in 2004.</p>
<p>Despite the productivity of these discussions, dialogue is strained by the developments in some provinces of the Communion primarily concerning the <a href="../../../o/r/d/Ordination_of_women.html" title="Ordination of women">ordination of women</a>, and the ordination of those in public same-sex sexual relationships as priests and, in one case, a bishop (<a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene_Robinson_d573.html" title="Gene Robinson">Gene Robinson</a>).

The same issue blocked the first attempt at a covenant between the Church of England and the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodist_Church_of_Great_Britain_6b58.html" title="Methodist Church of Great Britain">Methodist Church of Great Britain</a>, but such a covenant was eventually signed in 2003 <a href="http://www.anglican-methodist.org.uk/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.anglican-methodist.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.</p>
<p>The issue of apostolic succession, as well as the willingness of some North American dioceses to offer partnership blessings and priestly ordination to people in same-sex sexual relationships, have hindered dialogue between Anglicans and <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evangelicalism.html" title="Evangelicalism">evangelical</a> Protestant denominations.</p>

<p>Dialogue has also been less fruitful with churches of the Orthodox Communion. The International Commission of the Anglican-Orthodox Theological Dialogue was only established in 1999, and the Anglican Oriental Orthodox International Commission was established three years later. So far, most common ground has been established only concerning matters of the historic creeds. In a move parallel to the parishes of the <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pastoral_provision.html" title="Pastoral provision">pastoral provision</a> in the Roman Catholic Church a small number of United States Anglicans have been received into certain jurisdictions of the Orthodox Church while retaining the use of a revision of the Prayer Book liturgy authorised for use in the Orthodox Church by Patriarch Tikhon of Moscow in the early twentieth century.</p>
<p>Regarding mutual recognition of ministry, the Eastern Orthodox Churches are reluctant to even consider the question of the validity of holy orders in isolation from the rest of the Christian faith, so in practice they treat Anglican ordinations as invalid. Thus the favourable judgement expressed by the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople in 1922 and communicated by him to other Eastern Patriarchs (some of whom, including the Russian Patriarch, signed a contrary declaration in 1948) is in practice without effect. The Eastern Orthodox Church classifies Anglican clergymen who join it as laypeople, and, if they are to function as clergy, administers ordination to them. <a href="http://www.orthodox.clara.net/orthodoxy_and_anglicanism.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.orthodox.clara.net/orthodoxy_and_anglicanism.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
