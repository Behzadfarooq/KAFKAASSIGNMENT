<p>The <b>list of monarchs of Scotland</b> concerns the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Scotland_2d91.html" title="Kingdom of Scotland">Kingdom of Scotland</a>. According to tradition, the <a href="../../../s/t/a/State.html" title="State">state</a> was created by <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cin%C3%A1ed_I_of_Scotland_4067.html" title="Cináed I of Scotland">Cináed I of Scotland</a> in <a href="../../../8/4/3/843.html" title="843">843</a>, however modern historiography would tend to see his grandson <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantine_II_of_Scotland_35f6.html" title="Constantine II of Scotland">Constantine II of Scotland</a> as the creator of the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Alba_1365.html" title="Kingdom of Alba">kingdom of Alba</a> which became Scotland. The <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independence.html" title="Independence">independent</a> <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarchy.html" title="Monarchy">kingdom</a> changed in nature following the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Acts_of_Union_1707_b9a1.html" title="Acts of Union 1707">Acts of Union</a> in <a href="../../../1/7/0/1707.html" title="1707">1707</a>.

<p>Although genealogists divide the monarchs of Scotland into "Houses", based on continental European ideas of <a href="../../../d/y/n/Dynasty.html" title="Dynasty">dynasties</a>, it appears that the kings and queens of Scotland, insofar as they thought about their ultimate origins, traced their descent from <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fergus_M%C3%B3r_2d07.html" title="Fergus Mór">Fergus Mór</a>, the legendary founder of <a href="../../../d/%C3%A1/l/D%C3%A1l_Riata_541a.html" title="Dál Riata">Dál Riata</a> said to have flourished in the late 5th century. James VI is recorded as saying that he was a "Monarch sprunge of Ferguse race". After the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Restoration_df9a.html" title="English Restoration">Restoration of 1660</a>, when Jacob de Wet was commissioned to produce portraits of Scotland's past and present rulers for <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holyrood_Palace_0388.html" title="Holyrood Palace">Holyrood Palace</a>, the series began with Fergus Mór.</p>
<p>From the reign of <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macbeth_of_Scotland_3dd6.html" title="Macbeth of Scotland">Macbeth of Scotland</a>, Scottish monarchs most commonly employed the style <b>King of Scots</b> or <b>Queen of Scots</b>, with the exception of the final three: William III, Mary II and Anne used the style "of Scotland" rather than "of Scots" (see <a href="../../../s/t/y/Style_of_the_monarchs_of_Scotland_d485.html" title="Style of the monarchs of Scotland">Style of the monarchs of Scotland</a>). The Gaelic styles <i>rí Alban</i> (King of Scotland) and <i>ard-rí Alban</i> (High-King of Scotland) were in use from the time of Constantine II.</p>

<p>Although tradition makes Cináed I and his descendants kings of Scots, Irish and Scots sources continue to use the term king of the Picts for most of the 9th century.

In this period the kingdom was extended north and west. The <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mormaerdom_of_Moray_6235.html" title="Mormaerdom of Moray">Mormaerdom of Moray</a> was conquered in 1130, <a href="../../../s/u/t/Sutherland.html" title="Sutherland">Sutherland</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/i/Caithness.html" title="Caithness">Caithness</a> passed under Scots control from that of the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earldom_of_Orkney_7028.html" title="Earldom of Orkney">Earldom of Orkney</a>, and the descendants of <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somerled.html" title="Somerled">Somerled</a>, who ruled the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_the_Isles_4c49.html" title="Kingdom of the Isles">kingdom of the Isles</a>, were brought under Scots influence. While the kingdom was extended to include <a href="../../../c/u/m/Cumbria.html" title="Cumbria">Cumbria</a> and the Earldom of Northumberland during the reign of David I, while the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_England_1e4c.html" title="Kingdom of England">Kingdom of England</a> was weakened by civil war, the Scots were unable to keep these lands when David I died and the powerful and energetic <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_II_of_England_0faa.html" title="Henry II of England">Henry II of England</a> faced the inexperienced Malcolm IV.</p>
<p>This period also saw considerable changes in the practices of succession, changing from brother following brother, as seen from 1094 to 1125, to son following father, as in 1214 and 1249. The <a href="../../../m/e/i/Meic_Uilleim_e82c.html" title="Meic Uilleim">Meic Uilleim</a>, descendant of <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_fitz_Duncan_9c2f.html" title="William fitz Duncan">William fitz Duncan</a>, raised several rebellions to support their claims to the throne, but were eventually defeated.

<p>From the death of Alexander III in March 1286 until the accession of Robert II in 1371, the kingdom of the Scots faced repeated crises in the succession, interregnums, civil wars and invasions. This period saw the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Balliol_82b1.html" title="House of Balliol">Balliol</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Bruce_1c6b.html" title="House of Bruce">Bruce</a> families contest the throne, and invasions by the English kings <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_I_of_England_530d.html" title="Edward I of England">Edward I</a>, <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_II_of_England_c4d9.html" title="Edward II of England">Edward II</a> and <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_III_of_England_1878.html" title="Edward III of England">Edward III</a>.

<p>The death of Alexander III in March 1286 left Scotland without an obvious heir to the throne.

Margaret died in <a href="../../../o/r/k/Orkney.html" title="Orkney">Orkney</a> in late September or early October 1290, as yet uncrowned, leaving the succession disputed.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Cause_7f81.html" title="Great Cause">Great Cause</a>, while it involved many claimants to the throne, was in fact a dispute between two families, that of Bruce and that of Balliol.

<p>In 1306, Robert Bruce killed John Comym during a conference in Greyfriars Church, <a href="../../../d/u/m/Dumfries.html" title="Dumfries">Dumfries</a>. Bruce and his allies then opened hostilities against Edward I and his allies. The murder of Comyn placed his kinsmen and allies on the side of Edward I, and what had previously been a war between Scots and English became a civil war. Bruce and his allies eventually prevailed, and the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Edinburgh-Northampton_5ded.html" title="Treaty of Edinburgh-Northampton">Treaty of Edinburgh-Northampton</a> was signed on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_17.html" title="March 17">17 March</a> <a href="../../../1/3/2/1328.html" title="1328">1328</a>, making peace with England.</p>
<p>The Balliol family, represented by John's son <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_of_Scotland_1281.html" title="Edward of Scotland">Edward</a>, still claimed the throne, and had support from those dispossessed by Robert I in the wars. Edward Balliol's invasion in 1332 met with great success, and the child-king David II was sent to France since nowhere in Scotland was safe.</p>

<p>The inheritance of the kingship was contested in Scotland until well after the death of King MacBeth - it was basically elective, except that the choice of candidates was only from among the derbfine (those whose great-grandfather had been king), but in practice the winner was chosen by the biggest battalions (until, after 1296, Edward Longshanks concentrated minds - and it was English claims of overlordship which finally drove Scotland to accept the certainty of primogeniture as the basis of succession to the crown).</p>
<p>A highly detailed presentation of succession patterns of this realm is given at <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competitors_for_the_Crown_of_Scotland_9d1e.html" title="Competitors for the Crown of Scotland">competitors for the Crown of Scotland</a>. Many quirks of the succession rights are there.</p>
<p>The Scottish-Gaelic tradition followed that of the Irish-Gaels, i.e choosing from among the derbfine, agnates of the royal family, using the precautionary practice of <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanistry.html" title="Tanistry">tanistry</a>. Others claim, quoting Bede, who says he's quoting others ("alii dicunt"), that the Pictish tradition favoured matrilineal descent. That is, the head of the kingdom, as well as of sub-kingdoms and chieftaincies, etc., always inherited the crown through his mother, as a ranking princess royal, not through his father. (See, e.g., <i>The Lion in the North: A Personal View of Scotland's History</i>, by John Prebble <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-14-003652-0</a>&#160;; among other works.) Thus, you, as king, would not be succeeded by your own son but would normally be succeeded by your mother's other sons; then by your sisters' sons; then, your maternal aunt's sons; and so on, travelling through the female line of the royal house. This combination of male succession through matrilineal descent produced a cumbersome system under which the throne passed cyclically from brother to brother, then uncle to nephew, and then cousin to cousin, before starting over as brother to brother, uncle to nephew, etc. {See, e.g., <i>The Lion in the North: A Personal View of Scotland's History</i>, by John Prebble; among other works.}</p>
<p>On the other hand, the whole idea of matrilinear descent is thoroughly exposed as an unnecessary complication, by Alfred P. Smyth wielding Occam's razor in "Warlords and Holy Men" <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-7486-0100-7</a>, which argues for a more down-to-earth interpretation of the succession (such as we know it) to the crown of Alba. The Gaels and the Cruithne ("Prydyn", "Picts") had been contesting for years for control of Albania - Scotland north of the Forth-Clyde; the Britons of Strathclyde had by no means been subdued after Degsastan, and were still able to put an occasional king into Pictavia - in fact, the Britons of Dumbarton (AlClutha - the Rock of the Clyde) enjoyed overlordship in several periods, imposing kings on the Picts, their near-cousins. One of history's biggest "What-if"s argues that if the later Vikings hadn't needed the Clyde-Forth nexus between Dublin and York (believe it!) then the diocese of Glasgow might have become the religious centre of northern Britain, as it indeed was of Greater Cumbria - Kentigern vs Cuthbert.</p>
<p>The later status of Strathclyde as the tanist's toy kingdom suggests that at times Pictavia had been so used by the Gaels when in ascendancy - perhaps given to a British son-in-law as a sop.</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/%C3%A1/e/M%C3%A1el_Coluim_II_of_Scotland_70c6.html" title="Máel Coluim II of Scotland">Máel Coluim II</a> tried to get around this system by killing off all of the agnate heirs between himself and his grandson, Duncan; except for Prince <a href="../../../l/u/l/Lulach.html" title="Lulach">Lulach</a> of Moray, who was just five years old at the time and - more importantly - was rumoured to be half-witted (thus, he survived). <a href="../../../d/u/n/Duncan_I_of_Scotland_078f.html" title="Duncan I of Scotland">Duncan I</a> did become king, but Lulach's step-father, Mac Bethad - rendered "<a href="../../../m/a/c/Macbeth_of_Scotland_3dd6.html" title="Macbeth of Scotland">Macbeth</a>" in English - successfully claimed the throne in his own right and on Lulach's behalf. Lulach and Macbeth were from the most Pictish regions of the realm, basing their rights on the matrilineal Pictish order of succession - or so some say.</p>
<p>Duncan I's son, <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malcolm_III_Canmore_2a0c.html" title="Malcolm III Canmore">Malcolm III Canmore</a>, ultimately returned from exile in England and took the throne from Macbeth (1040-1057) and Lulach (the latter reigning 1057-1058, after the death of Macbeth in battle against Malcolm). Malcolm, married to Margaret Athelingsdaughter, whose womb carried the right-by-primogeniture to the throne of England, was succeeded by his brother, as Duncan II Bàn, who was deposed by his nephew, a fan of primogeniture, but then took the throne again from the youngling, until the youngster got the big battalions. So Malcolm Canmore was succeeded by four of his own sons - one of whom, <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Edgar_of_Scotland_693d.html" title="King Edgar of Scotland">Edgar</a> (1097-1107), changed the official language of Scotland from Gàidhlig (then still a Scottish dialect of Old Irish) to Inglis (then a language more similar to Northern English (Anglian) than the southern, "Saxon" dialects of English; the Viking invasions would soon re-write the dialect map). Gaelic dominance of Scotland ended during the reign of <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Alexander_I_of_Scotland_753a.html" title="King Alexander I of Scotland">Alexander I</a> (Alasdair I)(1107-1124), and the old Celtic system of derbfine + tanistry finally gave way to the more "European" system of primogeniture when Edward I of England began swashing his buckler, because it was seen how easily anyone with a claim to the throne through being of the derbfine could be corrupted by foreign gold; as the kings of Scots had married beyond their borders, so had their ideas of succession been adapted to foreign patterns.</p>
<p>In later medieval era, feudal succession patterns emerged in Scotland in succession patterns of fiefs, real estates and some hereditary territorial officces, and the royal succession floowed suit. Feudal <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primogeniture.html" title="Primogeniture">primogeniture</a> or <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proximity_of_blood.html" title="Proximity of blood">proximity of blood</a> was strongly as a basis of succession then. Daughters had a relatively high success when claiming the succession when there were no sons.</p>
<p>Edward I's decision in 1292 case supported the principle of primogeniture, in its cognatic form.</p>
<p>There have been alleged medieval renunciations to the crown of Scotland, validity of which were contested.</p>
<p>Illegitimate birth apparently left descendants with some sort of rights to succession, though not very strong. Obviously, legitimate birth was preferred.</p>
<p>When in fully Gaelic realms, inheritance through women was difficult, it was quite accepted in Scottish succession. After the accession of <a href="../../../d/u/n/Duncan_I_of_Scotland_078f.html" title="Duncan I of Scotland">Duncan I of Scotland</a> (the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Dunkeld_7470.html" title="House of Dunkeld">House of Dunkeld</a>), in all subsequent succession twists, grandsons and nephews from female descent were accepted candidates. In 1292 <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_de_Dunbar%2C_7th_Earl_of_Dunbar_f725.html" title="Patrick de Dunbar, 7th Earl of Dunbar">Patrick de Dunbar, 7th Earl of Dunbar</a> claimed the crown as the <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnate.html" title="Agnate">agnate</a> of the House of Dunkeld, being (a) the closest agnate, and (b) a candidate based on <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanistry.html" title="Tanistry">tanistry</a> of agnates of the house where Alexander III belonged to. He descended, in an allegedly legitimate unbroken male line, from a younger brother of King <a href="../../../d/u/n/Duncan_I_of_Scotland_078f.html" title="Duncan I of Scotland">Duncan I of Scotland</a> (who allegedly also was a younger son of <a href="../../../b/e/t/Bethoc_of_Scotland_2eb2.html" title="Bethoc of Scotland">Bethoc of Scotland</a>, the male line being that of Lords of Dunbar, originally Earls of Northumbria, later Earls of Dunbar (see <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_March_1f8d.html" title="Earl of March">Earl of March</a>). He however did not win the contest, as heirs who descended through female line but were genealogically closer, were preferred over him.</p>
<p><a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Balliol_b536.html" title="John Balliol">John Balliol</a>, son of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John%2C_5th_Baron_de_Balliol_6201.html" title="John, 5th Baron de Balliol">John Balliol</a> by his wife Devorguilla, daughter of <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan%2C_Lord_of_Galloway_fe09.html" title="Alan, Lord of Galloway">Alan, Lord of Galloway</a> by his wife Margaret, eldest daughter of <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_of_Scotland%2C_8th_Earl_of_Huntingdon_467b.html" title="David of Scotland, 8th Earl of Huntingdon">David, Earl of Huntingdon</a>, son of <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_of_Scotland%2C_3rd_Earl_of_Huntingdon_af56.html" title="Henry of Scotland, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon">Henry, Earl of Huntingdon</a>, son of King <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_I_of_Scotland_9be5.html" title="David I of Scotland">David I</a> was the primogenitural heir in legitimate, cognatic line. Adjudication deemed his right as the strongest, and accordingly he was crowned as the king.</p>
<p><a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Bruce%2C_Lord_of_Annandale_24f4.html" title="Robert Bruce, Lord of Annandale">Robert de Brus, Lord of Annandale</a>, son of Robert de Brus the Lord of Annandale by his wife Isabella, second daughter of <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_of_Scotland%2C_8th_Earl_of_Huntingdon_467b.html" title="David of Scotland, 8th Earl of Huntingdon">David, Earl of Huntingdon</a>, son of <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_of_Scotland%2C_3rd_Earl_of_Huntingdon_af56.html" title="Henry of Scotland, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon">Henry, Earl of Huntingdon</a>, son of King <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_I_of_Scotland_9be5.html" title="David I of Scotland">David I</a>, who had been Regent of Scotland sometime during minority of King and was occasionally recognized as a Tanist of the Scottish Throne, pleaded <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanistry.html" title="Tanistry">tanistry</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proximity_in_degree_of_kinship.html" title="Proximity in degree of kinship">proximity in degree of kinship</a> to the deceased King. His right apparently was regarded as the second strongest.</p>
<p>From the advent of feudal era in Scotland, the kingship of Scots evolved together with their right to succession of England inherited from the Anglosaxon royal dynasty through <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Margaret_of_Scotland_ef72.html" title="St Margaret of Scotland">St Margaret of Scotland</a>. After the Balliols, the rights, reckoned on basis of feudal primogeniture, continued to counts of Coucy and then to Bourbons of Vendome, uniting with the Navarrese crown in person of the future Henry IV of France. Currently it is held by <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice%2C_Duchess_of_Calabria_f9df.html" title="Alice, Duchess of Calabria">Alice, Duchess of Calabria</a> - as advertised in her son's website.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacobitism.html" title="Jacobitism">Jacobite claim</a>, based on feudal primogeniture (the prevalent Scottish succession order) descent from Stewarts, namely from Charles I, is detailed in a separate article and currently belongs to <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz%2C_Duke_of_Bavaria_f065.html" title="Franz, Duke of Bavaria">Franz, Duke of Bavaria</a>. They happen to represent also the claim from king <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_of_England_b476.html" title="Stephen of England">Stephen of England</a>.</p>
<p>When <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_II_of_Scotland_0b92.html" title="Robert II of Scotland">Robert II of Scotland</a>, the first <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stewart.html" title="Stewart">Stewart</a> on the throne, had succeeded, he made the parliament to confirm the succession order due to several reasons. First, his eldest children's legitimacy was questionable due to his problematic marital alliances. secondly, the Bruce succession set by force of arms was still something to get settled against competitors.</p>
<p>That succession order was Semi-Salic and stipulated all children of his two marriages eligble, despite any controversy in their births outside matrimony. First, all the male-line descent from him was entitled to succession (as in agnatic primogeniture) before any female or descendant through female descent could succeed. Then, after exhaustion of all males, female succession became allowed.</p>
<p>Indeed, in decades before the birth of the future <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary%2C_Queen_of_Scots_8791.html" title="Mary, Queen of Scots">Mary, Queen of Scots</a>, there existed at least two and possibly more male-line branches of Robert II's dynasty. The longest-surviving of them was the main royal line up to <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_V_of_Scotland_bb34.html" title="James V of Scotland">James V of Scotland</a>, but the second-longest survivor line, that of <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_of_Albany_4060.html" title="Duke of Albany">Duke of Albany</a> of the second creation, went extinct only some seven years prior (<a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Stewart%2C_2nd_Duke_of_Albany_0418.html" title="John Stewart, 2nd Duke of Albany">John Stewart, 2nd Duke of Albany</a> and count-consort of Auvergne, died as late as in 1536). Had they provided one more generation, Mary would have not succeeded her father, and the throne would have passed to Albany branch of Stewarts.</p>
<p>However, James V being the last-surviving male-line Stewart descended from Robert II, he was entitled to leave the kingdom to his daughter, in absence of other agnates.</p>
<p>At the time of Mary's birth, the next heir were Hamiltons, Earl of Arran and his family, all of them already from female descent.</p>
<p>After Mary's accession, it is unclear whether any Salic provision was any longer in force. That became never a practical issue, since the junior royal Stuart dynasty never developed any agnate cadet branch in a way that a female would have been before it in the order of succession. However, if the provision were left and Scotland yet a separate kingdom, Victoria's accession in England would have separated Scotland - as would have Elizabeth II's, too. They both had uncles of male line who would have been more entitled to succession in pattern devised by Robert II.</p>
