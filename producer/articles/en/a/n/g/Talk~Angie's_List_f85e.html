<p>As an employee of Angie's List I'd like to offer some suggestions to improve the Angie's List article and work toward <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>. (I'll refrain from from editing the actual page to keep any bias I may show out of the article):</p>
<ul>
<li>We are now in 124 cities and have over 500,000 members. <a href="http://www.ibj.com/html/detail_page.asp?content=408" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ibj.com/html/detail_page.asp?content=408" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>

</ul>
</li>
<li>In the first sentence, I think the qualifier "little more" is first of all an inaccurate portrayal of what the New York Times article says, unnecessary, and presents a negative point of view.
<ul>
<li>Replaced with the excact NYT quote~ <i><a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn"><span style="color:#0cc">ONUnicorn</span></a></i><sup>(Talk|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ONUnicorn_939c.html" title="Special:Contributions/ONUnicorn">Contribs</a>)</sup><small><a href="../../../p/%26/s/WP%7EP%26S_1d27.html" title="WP:P&amp;S">problem solving</a></small></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I would also ask that somebody change the category number to more than 250 categories. I wouldn't put an exact number since we are adding to and growing our category list all the time. It started with 150 and grew to over 250 last year. An Indiana Business Journal article quotes the number at 400 now. <a href="http://www.ibj.com/html/detail_page.asp?content=408" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ibj.com/html/detail_page.asp?content=408" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>

</ul>
</li>
<li>At the end of the first paragraph, it is true that there was once an Angie Cash fundraising program. However, I feel it is presented negatively by saying "resorted to." It wasn't a last resort. It was a way to open in new cities and have reviews for people to use right away. Please consider rewording this.
<ul>
<li>I agree the wording here is problematical. I've been searching off and on all-day for any sort of source that gives more detail about the program and haven't found anything except cached versions of old webpages. Do you know where we could go to read about this defunct program? I'm sort of unclear how exactly it worked.~ <i><a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn"><span style="color:#0cc">ONUnicorn</span></a></i><sup>(<a href="../../../o/n/u/User_talk%7EONUnicorn_f780.html" title="User talk:ONUnicorn">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ONUnicorn_939c.html" title="Special:Contributions/ONUnicorn">Contribs</a>)</sup><small><a href="../../../p/%26/s/WP%7EP%26S_1d27.html" title="WP:P&amp;S">problem solving</a></small></li>

<li>Angie's List does not control a company's ratings, the members do. The only reports Angie's List will not accept are those containing inappropriate language, or those that we discover are submitted by a company or a surrogate (friend or family member) on their own company or a competing company. If you have a verifiable and reliable source that says Angie's List actually chooses which reports to accept in an effort to control ratings, please provide that source, otherwise this statement should be removed.
<ul>
<li>I've asked for a source several times and <a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.163.255.34.html" title="User talk:24.163.255.34">24.163.255.34</a> keeps removing the request.

</ul>
</li>
<li>The 15,000 reports a month refers to the number that are actually added to the list and does not include any reports that have to be excluded for the above reasons.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Somebody added the comment that "Assuming it uses them all, it would take over 77 years for Angie's List to get, on average, a single review on each of the 14 million businesses in the United States." I don't understand what this has to do with anything. Angie's list doesn't claim to try to obtain reports on all 14 million business in the US. Angie's List doesn't even rate certain service industries such as restaurants and retailers at this time. We are also not in every city of the US yet.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Also, I don't understand why everything says that Angie's List "claims" when there are cited sources which provide this information. It is more than a claim, it is a verifiable statement.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps someone would like to review the current articles on <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insider_Pages_fba1.html" title="Insider Pages">Insider Pages</a> and <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yelp.html" title="Yelp">Yelp</a> to see what a more npov would like for this type of company (even though there are a lot of differences in the companies themselves). I also like the features section on those pages - anyone interested in starting that?<a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarahER_b941.html" title="User:SarahER">SarahER</a> 20:08, 1 February 2007 (UTC)SarahER</li>
</ul>
<p>Sarah, there seem to be many problems with those articles as well. For example, the InsiderPages article makes a statement that the company has laid off 2/3 of its work force and cites a blog which states that its getting its information from the competitors of the company. Hardly a reliable source. Recognizing that you are a competitor, perhaps you can contribute to the talk pages for those articles to get the editing process started, perhaps even suggesting that someone remove the Angie's List link since you seem to be of the opinion that such links are spam (I noticed that you removed the links to these companies on the Angie's List article. Personally, I'm not particularly interested in those companies since, as far as I know, neither of those companies have made grandiose statements about themselves as Angie's List has done in my opinion. Neither of them charge consumers, as far as I know, and as far as I can tell neither of them edit the reviews provided by users. Since you are in the industry, perhaps you know more about those companies than any of us editing this page. So get the ball rolling if you would--24.163.255.34 06:44, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>OnUnicorn: First of all, you should not have removed those links. They were clearly marked as what they are "critical reviews of Angie's List" When those links were added and then removed, the wiki article looked like an Angie's list press release.</dd>
<dd>Sarah: A neutral point of view requires that otherwise misleading "facts" be accompanied by some proper perspective.</dd>
<dd>Examples:</dd>
<dd>1. Saying you have 15000 reports a month sounds great until you consider what that means. So, you either need to add a fair perspective or delete the misleading fact. I choose to add a fair perspective. Delete the fact entirely if you want.
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>You may consider it a fair perspective but it's misleading. I think it would be more fair to say that "some submissions may not be included if they violate the membership agreement" and then let the readers draw their own conclusions from that. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarahER_b941.html" title="User:SarahER">SarahER</a> 17:09, 5 February 2007 (UTC)SarahER</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>2. Saying contractors can't post reviews on themselves is misleading unless Angie's List explains what exactly prevents a contractor from using surrogates to bypass this rule. As far as I can tell, nothing. Your own comment that "those that we discover are submitted by a company or a surrogate" seems to acknowledge the problem, but you don't say how you go about "discovering" this, or if you even try considering the fact that it is not in the company's interest to do so, considering the extra revenues from this pratice (more subscriptions) and the very high costs of trying to prevent it in any meaningful way.
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I believe it does say, with a cited source, how we go about discovering false reports. Every report is reviewed by an employee and checked for irregularities. There are many things employees are trained to look for, some of which are described in the Chicago Sun Times article. <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/business/duros/197949,HOF-News-right05.article" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.suntimes.com/business/duros/197949,HOF-News-right05.article" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> I realize you'll argue that this information comes from the company, but if you don't consider a newspaper article (or a business journal) a reliable source please let me know where you expect to find any reliably sourced information on any business. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarahER_b941.html" title="User:SarahER">SarahER</a> 17:09, 5 February 2007 (UTC)SarahER</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The term "resorted" is a fair interpretation of the New York Times article, and is a FACT, the wiki article does not say "last resort"</dd>
<dd>Angie's List does not incorporate every member submission. That is a fact confirmed on its own website. Readers of the article may draw their own conclusions. No one will ever find a reliable source that this is done "in a effort to control ratings" as it is virtually impossible to find sources of someone's intent. You say that the members not Angie's List controls ratings. Assuming the company does not pick and choose, by your own admission, you would need to state "the members and those we have paid to submit reviews control the ratings."
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>As I stated above, I think it would be more fair and appropriate to say that "some submissions may not be included if they violate the membership agreement" and then let the readers draw their own conclusions from that. We don't "pick and choose." Perhaps you would be satisfied with saying that "consumers" submit reviews and therefore control the ratings. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarahER_b941.html" title="User:SarahER">SarahER</a> 17:09, 5 February 2007 (UTC)SarahER</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Use of the phrase "claims to" or "according to" is this only way to portray "facts" that come from the company itself while still maintaining a npov. "Company profile" newspaper articles, which is what most of the cited sources are, rely almost exclusively on information from the company itself, which is why they always sound great. These articles are largely due to the efforts of the company's public relations departments. Business Journals are the worst at this and should not be considered any more reliable than any other source including blogs, in my humble opinon. Compare the New York Times article which profiles not a single company, but an industry. Anyway, the use of the term "claims to" is the only way to include the statement while still maintaining a npov.</dd>
<dd>Of course their is a case to be made that the whole article is merely an advertisement. You don't suppose that's why there is an Angie's List employee on this site checking on it? Perish the thought. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.163.255.34 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.163.255.34.html" title="User talk:24.163.255.34">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.163.255.34_c7a5.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.163.255.34">contribs</a>) 2007-02-01t22:10:45z.</small></dd>

<dd>I still believe "Assuming it uses them all, at that rate it would take over 77 years for Angie's List to get, on average, a single review on each of the 14 million businesses in the United States" is unnecessary and doesn't belong. This is not useful information about the company. See my above comment. &#160;:::The membership data and financial information all seems to amount to original research to me. Much of it is based on assumptions which are entirely incorrect.</dd>
<dd>This article is far from an advertisement and my intention isn't to make it one. My intention is to keep it fair, accurate and neutral. Of course someone is going to notice when untrue statements are made about our company on a well known site like Wikipedia.<a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarahER_b941.html" title="User:SarahER">SarahER</a> 17:09, 5 February 2007 (UTC)SarahER</dd>

<ul>
<li>I disagree 100% Angies List is only valuable if it does what it says it does "aggregate consumer reviews" If the consumer reviews only trickle in, it's worthless, and the company acknowledges that paid reviews are also not considered reliable.</li>
<li>Why don't you just release your financial information then?</li>
<li><i>What exactly is untrue about the current article? Saying generally that it is untrue or inaccurate is like President Clinton saying "I did not have sexual relations with that woman...these allegations are false" (a true statement, but designed to mislead others into beleiving that there is no truth to it.) If something is inaccurate, publish corrected and complete information on your website so we can reference it. You are selling the credibility of your list, yet there are a number of problems with your model that taints that credibility, 1) you paid for at least some of the reviews and do not disclose that on your website to new subscribers, 2) you accept advertising from those that are reviewed, creating a potential bias, 3) you determine which reviews to use and which ones not to use without publishing any information about how you determine that, 4) according to a reviewer on RateItAll.com, you forced a member give a contractor a B or better review when they did not want to, which if true explains why most of the companies have a B or better rating. If true, I think you need to fully disclose this policy, 5) there is a gaping loophole in your rule than contractors can't rate themselves, as pointed out in the article (a loophole which you have little incentive to close since it would drastically increase costs and the current loophole helps you sell more memberships, and 6) as mentioned in the article, what prevents Angie's List or its members from being sued by companies which are defamed? If the answer is nothing, then I would say that tempers the reviews significantly, unless you are not warning your members about that problem, which I'm sure your members would not appreciate when served with a summons.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>I do think the stated purpose is a wonderful idea, but Angie's List model doesn't even come close to acheiving that goal, although it may work on a small scale.<i><small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.163.255.34 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.163.255.34.html" title="User talk:24.163.255.34">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.163.255.34_c7a5.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.163.255.34">contribs</a>).</small></i></p>

<p>Some of the requests for citiation are just silly. If you have a source that says Jack has two dollars and another that says Jill has three dollars, you don't need another source to support a statement that says Jack and Jill have $5 between them.</p>
<p>Of course the expense section is somewhat speculative. Angie's List doesn't release the information as far as I know. However, I don't think its speculating to say that Angie's List must pay its employees <i>at least</i> what the law requires even though they may be paying much more and we don't know for sure if they are complying with minimum wage laws. The point of the section is to inform the reader about categories of expenses based in its stated activities. Without this section, it makes the $14 million in revenues seem like the company is highly profitable, even though this may not be the case. Releasing your revenues without releasing your expenses is a common way companies puff themselves up, even though they may be losing money Anyway, the expense section makes the article better and the section makes clear that these are not based on raw numbers.</p>
<p>Just so I understand where you are coming from, what "accusations" would you be referring to, Milo? It seems like you may be defining an "accusation" as a statement of fact that Angie's List doesn't like.</p>
<p>Your editing of this discussion page makes it much harder to follow a given topic, in my opinion. Intermingling helps us stay on topic. I do agree that signing would be helpful, so here it is--24.163.255.34 17:58, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Speculation doesn't belong in WP articles, if we don't know a fact we shouldn't mention it in an article, not try and guess what it might be. If a reliable source has made a guess, we can cite that, but we can't do speculation, or even analysis or deduction. To put a $23.5M number in the article, you must have a source giving it. I'd urge you to read <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> if you haven't already, it specifically forbids analysis or synthesis of existing facts.

<p>Milo, thanks for your opinion. Do you have some kind of authority here we should know about? If not, please refrain from your threats as anyone can revert anything you remove. Perhaps you aren't as up to date on Wikipedia policies as you think you are. As pointed out by earlier you should look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Ignore_all_rules" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Ignore_all_rules" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> before citing any Wikipedia policies. I reverted your edits because your demand for citiations is nonsense. It's adding perspective to a misleading fact, specifically Angie's List claims of $14 in revenue. "Revenue" is misleading without expenses you needed to incur to produce that revenue. This is an article about a company where almost every single source can be traced directly back to the company itself. Must we park our brains at the door and assume the company is going to release only neutral information? SUGGESTION: If you don't want what you call speculation in the article, I think we need to remove all revenue information and the 500,000 membership number from the article. The 500,000 number is clearly misleading unless clarified that it includes "members" using a free subscription. Revenue information without expense information is also misleading. Don't forget, there is an Angie's List employee (we assume) reviewing this article. If information is inaccurate, they can easily release information that we can cite to correct any error.</p>
<p>I also notice that you did not answer my question about what accusation are you referring to, or was that just a rant? If so, no problem. Rant away. I can take it&#160;:)--24.163.255.34 19:22, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

As far as I can see, this is not one of those instances. As I said on your talk page; readers are not stupid. If I have a source saying Jack has two dollars and another that says Jill has three dollars, I don't need to make a statement that Jack and Jill have $5 between them because the reader can figure that out on their own. For me to say that the fact that Jack has two dollars and Jill has three dollars so they have five dollars means they cannot possibly buy a sandwich from Subway that costs $6.25 is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> and <i>does not belong in the article</i>, no matter what <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">ignore all rules</a> says. ~ <i><a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn"><span style="color:#0cc">ONUnicorn</span></a></i><sup>(<a href="../../../o/n/u/User_talk%7EONUnicorn_f780.html" title="User talk:ONUnicorn">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ONUnicorn_939c.html" title="Special:Contributions/ONUnicorn">Contribs</a>)</sup><small><a href="../../../p/%26/s/WP%7EP%26S_1d27.html" title="WP:P&amp;S">problem solving</a></small> 19:52, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The "rules" <b>are</b> getting in the way of doing what is best. That is the point. The rule pertains to what is best for Wikipedia, not what is best for Angie's List. Continuing with the example if you have reliable sources saying that Jack and Jill have $5 between them and Jack has $2, I don't think it's original research to say Jill has $3, especially if another source says, "Jill has lots of money" It's just grade school math and adding persective on an otherwise misleading fact of "Jill has lots of money" since we don't know what "lots of money" means. Now original research would be "Jill is obviously greedy" "Jill is more frugal than Jack" or "Jill makes more money than Jack"</p>
<p>Your statement that "the reader can figure it out" is highly irresponsible when dealing with misleading facts cited in this article. IMHO. I think we can agree that what is best is "truthful, non-misleading information that a reader can turn to for reliable neutral information." Throwing in misleading facts from the company does a disservice to Wikipedia since it would just end up being another piece of the company's public relations strategy. Besides, if the reader can figure it out, why not just refer them to the Angie's List website and the articles. Obviously, that's not good for Wikipedia either, hense the ignore all rules rule.</p>
<p>Angie's List seems to beleive that it is okay to use non-"reliable sources" when reviewing companies. I guess turn-about is not fair play in Angie's world. Given that, it is my opinion that taking a few liberties with the normal "rules" is not entirely unjustified in this case.--24.166.174.10 20:41, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>With all due respect, you are merely repeating your "violation of wikipedia rules" argument. I wouldn't say there is "nothing" to back it up.

As to amount, do you not think its fair to presume that they pay their employees at least a minimum wage?

</dl>
<p>Would that include presuming the company is providing the reliable sources with neutral unbiased information or even accurate information? I don't know of any traditional print encyclopedia that would publish an article on a private company like Angie's List for many reasons ranging from lack of reliable information to "who cares?". Wikipedia does, and that is great. However, if we strictly apply the normal rules to this article (or any other profile of a company) that does not have to release accurate information to the public (i.e., those that are not required to make disclosures to the SEC), Wikipedia will become largely worthless as a reliable source of information on such companies. Hence, I beleive it is appropriate to perhaps not blanketly apply the "ignore all rules" rule but to be somewhat liberal in the application of rules where "reliable sources" are typically using an unreliable sources as their source, such as the case of articles where a company is profiled. As demonstrated, if inaccurate information is posted, the company can certainly correct it by disclosing accurate information and providing links to "reliable sources". Although I have viewed information provided by the company with critical eye (as we all should), I do not think I have not simply disregarded it in editing this article.--24.163.255.34 06:44, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We do not presume that the info provided by the company is unbiased. That's why we generally include the information as "the company says...". That the company actually said it is a fact and isn't disputed by anyone I assume including yourself. It's up to the reader to accept the infofrom the company or not. If there is public skepticism over numbers, that skepticism will be expressed by a reliable source and then may be included in the article. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 13:39, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think lying a strong word. I think the company is mostly spinning facts to make themselves look better, which is what companies do and probably why they are not to be considered reliable sources. I don't think it is appropriate to "collect facts to build a case against a company" but I also do not beleive one should blindly follow the company's spin, especially when there are inherent problems with that spin that can be demonstrated. Neither extreme would be a neutral point of view.</p>
<p>What part of the article accuses the company of "lying" in your mind and please explain just how "serious" they are.</p>
<p>I think this article was developing nicely and editors were reaching some consenus on disputed language without resorting to a flame war.

<dd>Actually, I think you were just getting happy with the article because there weren't enough eyes on it to keep you from ignoring policy and doing whatever you want. I came in when this article was mentioned elsewhere - if there are multiple editors who disagree with you (looks like it's up to three now including the original editor you were going back and forth with) and you still insist on your edits, even if they violate policy, it sure looks like you're the one who doesn't care what anyone thinks. To be honest, I don't even see this as a flame war - one editor doesn't want to follow NOR and WP:V.</dd>
<dd>I support removing any unsourced claims, and giving a chance to provide sources for the ones that are tagged now (you're using this time while it's protected to look for sources, right?). With nobody agreeing with Call Me 24 that I see, that would seem to be the prevalent consensus so far. Are we ready to have the article unprotected?

<p>I agree with CallMe. ONUnicorn probably doesn't agree. Milo doesn't agree, Mezule doesn't agree. Sarah claims to be an Angie's List employee, and I wonder if there are others are on here that just won't own up to that or are using multiple accounts. Wjohnson hasn't offered a firm opinion and neither has Icky-Wiki-God (other than on Jill). Milo, I think CallMe was referring to the "Don't be a dick" policy earlier, and Milo you are being a dick. Yes, I'm being a dick for citing the "do not be a dick" policy to Milo. I admit it. Nevertheless, he's being a dick and being subtle didn't work.</p>
<p>No one seems to be able to articulate a case for why CallMe is wrong other than "the rules" in which you ignore the "ignore all rules" rule in addition to the don't be a dick rule in certain cases.

<p>Financial</p>
<p>Because it is not publically traded, Angie's List is not required to release its financial information to the public. However, according to information released by the company, it has an estimated $14 million in annual revenue generated "primarily through advertising in its newsletter and by charging customers $4.95 a month, or $47 annually." Angie's List has not publicly disclosed its annual expenses nor overall profitablility data.</p>

<p>Milo, I'm glad you find the language acceptable, but let's give the other side a chance to express their views before we jump to the conclusion that there is a consensus. I think both sides might be a little too emotionally invested in this. You seem to be throwing more gasoline on this fire with you actions and comments, with little upside as far as I can tell. I quote the great Don Corleone "Never hate your enemies, it clouds your judgment" People who are emotionally invested in a position tend not to easily reach a compromise. Declaring a consensus exists when it doesn't reduces the chance of actually reaching one. So, let's all just relax and see what happens.--<a href="../../../i/c/k/User%7EIcky-Wiki-God_eff3.html" title="User:Icky-Wiki-God">Icky-Wiki-God</a> 22:34, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm ok with the changes. What makes you think I wouldn't be? I agree with Milo regarding the Alexa stats, but for a different reason. By itself I don't think it means much. You would have to compare it to the stats of competitors to be meaningful. The problem with that is Angie's List's competitors don't charge for access. So their traffic rank's are probably higher than if they would be if they too charged for access.</p>
<p>Some minor changes to the language may be "Since it is a private company... and in the quote I would replace the word "customers" with "[members]" Adverisers in their newsletter are Angie's List customers too. The word members seems more accurate.</p>
<p>Kudos to the Icky-Wiki-God for the suggestion, and for telling Milo that he's a being a dick in such a diplomatic manner. ONUnicorn - I don't think your version was quite like this and if I am wrong about that, please accept my apologies. --Call me 24 23:24, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Milo, the brackets are needed to indicate that it is not an exact quote. Brackets are also a wiki format which creates a link to another wikipedia page I beleive. Without the no-wiki format it will create a link rather than having brackets in the text. I'm not going to revert it, so I ask you to reconsider your change.--<a href="../../../i/c/k/User%7EIcky-Wiki-God_eff3.html" title="User:Icky-Wiki-God">Icky-Wiki-God</a> 00:21, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I propose removing the "77 years" line, without a source, it's original research. If a reliable source for it can be added, I'd be fine with keeping it.

<p>To keep in the spirit of compromise and consenus, if you delete it that line, how about changing the previous line to</p>
<p>Angie's List has not released data on the number of consumer reviews it receives per company listed, but does it does report receiving approximately 15,000 consumer reviews each month.[3]</p>
<p>This uses the 15,000 number but is less misleading than the current statement since it tells the reader that one can't tell the number of reviews per month without also knowing the number of contractors that are being reviewed.</p>

<p>Here are some more sources that might be able to help you other editors out:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1)In response to this statement, "According to the New York Times, companies like Angie's List suffer from few reviews per company listed" I found a source that shows Angie's List has up to 500 reports on some companies. There are not that many reports on all the companies, but I think this article does a good job of offering perspective and fair expectations. Older cities you can expect to find a lot of reviews in more popular categories, but in newer cities the list is still growing so you won't find as many. <a href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/spotlight_columnists/article/0,2777,DRMN_23962_4962239,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/spotlight_columnists/article/0,2777,DRMN_23962_4962239,00.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></li>
<li>(2) Here's a source that shows another step Angie's List takes in preventing reports from companies and their competitors. “Members are asked on each report to confirm that they have no link, or don't compete against the business.” <a href="http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/business/s_491183.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/business/s_491183.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></li>
<li>(3) This provides 2 view points so I think it's balanced and neutral:“Some business owners admit they are a tad leery that spiteful customers could attempt to distort a service experience and leave a negative comment without their knowledge. But Hicks' in-house staffers are skilled at picking out would-be saboteurs and are available to mediate disputes.'We have people who review the reports to make sure someone's not trying to stack the deck,' said Hicks, who said Angie's List employs 200 people in five offices nationwide. 'We vigorously police that stuff.' That's not enough for Gary Kearns of Dearborn-based Kearns Brothers Inc. home improvement business. Kearns, director of sales and marketing, checks the list to make sure customers accurately report the job. Kearns this week had 22 consumer reports posted on the site and carried an "A" rating.” <a href="http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061207/BIZ04/612070362/1013" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061207/BIZ04/612070362/1013" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> Also, in this article it says that this company received 22 reports in one week, so I think that shows that the reports are more than "trickling" in.</li>
<li>(4)More on keeping the list honest:"The limit is one review per business category every six months, to guard against ballot-box-stuffing. A staff of 200 keeps an eagle eye out for possible plants by business owners. But cheating is not a big problem, in part because the site attracts stand-up, community-minded people, Hicks said in a phone interview from headquarters in Indianapolis." <a href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/spotlight_columnists/article/0,2777,DRMN_23962_4962239,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/spotlight_columnists/article/0,2777,DRMN_23962_4962239,00.html" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> “Members are limited to reporting on a specific company once every six months to prevent users from skewing ratings, Hicks said.” <a href="http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061207/BIZ04/612070362/1013" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061207/BIZ04/612070362/1013" rel="nofollow">[12]</a></li>
<li>(5)“The fee doesn't bother Davis or many business owners, who claim there's less chance of abuse because people have to pay to leave a nasty comment.” <a href="http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061207/BIZ04/612070362/1013" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061207/BIZ04/612070362/1013" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></li>
<li>(6) And yes, the 500,000 figure probably does include some free members but there are no definite figures on how many are free and how many are paid. “New Angie's List locations launch as a free service to attract consumer reviews, but switch to a fee service once the content is built up, Hicks said.”<a href="http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061207/BIZ04/612070362/1013" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061207/BIZ04/612070362/1013" rel="nofollow">[14]</a></li>

<p>I hope some of this can help you improve the article. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarahER_b941.html" title="User:SarahER">SarahER</a> 01:15, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sarah, thanks for the contribution. Don't take my comments personally. You have a very tough job Sarah. I want to contribute to the discussion and address whether some of the stats and quotes you offer would be misleading. You know the old saying "there are lies, damn lies, and statistics." So I think we need to examine them a little bit before we just incorporate them into the article, particularly when the company seems to be the original source of all the information. I numbered your points above for clarity.</p>
<p>(1) That is a fair point, but it should need to address the age of the reviews too. One would expect the older cities have more reviews, but those reviews are probably not as current either. That's why the rate at which you receive reviews is important. It also does not address the average review per company listed and it seems like the people who sign up the day after they have to start paying don't seem to get their money's worth, because you don't tell them that all the reviews previously submitted were from free subscribers, which makes them less reliable according to Angie.</p>
<p>One of the articles you cite from December of 2006, claims that Angie's List gets only 5,000 reports a month nationally, as opposed to the 15,000 claim in the Wikipedia article. Please clarify which is accurate.</p>
<p>(2) That probably works as well as porn sites asking if the user is over 18. Come on Sarah, you kill your credibility when making statements like that. Adding that information to the article is going to make the company look foolish.</p>
<p>(3) Again, you are just saying "it's not allowed" You don't say how Angie's team of 200 prevents it. If a single company gets 22 reports in a single week when the average company only gets one a year (or whatever the number actually is) it looks like that company either a) has far superior market share than it's competitors, b) they do a great job of promoting Angie's List to their happy customers (which is still a distortion if true), c) they are simply cheating by submitting reviews themselves, d) or it is just an amazing coincidence few are likely to believe.</p>
<p>(4) Community minded people? How exactly did Angie determine that? That spin makes me dizzy.</p>
<p>(5) Why should the fee bother them, they are not supposed to be paying it? Wouldn't that also distort the ratings since some would like to leave a negative review, but not enough to pay your fee? Could you please confirm whether Angie's List has required its members who have disputes resolved through Angie's List to leave the contractor no worse than a B rating, as reported by a reviewer on RateItAll.com?</p>
<p>(6) "Probably includes some"? Doesn't Angie's List know that information as of any particular date?</p>
<p>It doesn't bother me that your company is spinning, that's what for profit companies are supposed to do. It bothers me that it spins while judging other companies and trying to portray itself as a version of Consumer Reports (a nonprofit that refuses all advertising and company samples or ANYTHING that might tarnish its reputation). At the same time, it is taking people's money and and making claims that so far have not been backed up by the facts. Despite another editor's statement that "readers are not stupid," some people can be and often are quite stupid and most people can be stupid or foolish or whatever term you want to use from time to time. Anyone really need a cite for that?</p>
<p>Remember a neutral point of view is the goal, not necessarily a neutral article. To illustrate the difference, I don't think an article about Stalin would need to be neutral in content to have a neutral point of view as he did deplorable things that history judges him for. Similarly an article about Mother Teresa would not need to be neutral in content to have a neutral point of view. --Call me 24 20:41, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Does anyone else have any input on incorporating my suggestions into the article? These sources are reliable so I'm not really sure what needs to be debated. If you have sources to back up your counterpoints, please let us know. Based on <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> I don't see why my sources shouldn't be used just because they include interviews with employees. They are reputable newspaper sources. Also, I'm not sure what your comment that we are "judging other companies and trying to portray itself as a version of Consumer Reports" has to do with this article. And where exactly are we judging other companies and portraying ourselves as Consumer Reports? What claims have we made that have not been backed up by facts? We are not just taking people's money, they are paying for a service which they find valuable. If they didn't find it valuable, they wouldn't pay for it. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarahER_b941.html" title="User:SarahER">SarahER</a> 14:44, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, I have input. Sorry Sarah, I agree with Callme. Sarah, your spin is really over the top and very misleading. Callme did you a favor by pointing out some of the ridiculous statements you wanted to add to the article. Your added spin of "These sources are reliable so I'm not really sure what needs to be debated" ignores npov which is the issue Callme is raising and the fact that only in the Wiki world might these sources be deemed reliable.</p>
<p>I also find it troubling that after almost a month, you did not address Callme's points, and instead sought help from others, which will probably be more Angie's List employees under different usernames. It seems the type of thing you would want to address if Angie's List wasn't a scam, especially points 1, 5 and 6. By the way, people have to pay Angie's List first before they know whether it is valuable to them or not, and like a patient getting a placebo, just because some may think it's valuable doesn't make it so. 64.151.41.50 06:45, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I really don't think that what Sarah is trying to do is spin the article, and it is a gross overstatement to say that any spin is over the top. If anything, she is trying to provide facts to accusations that have been made about the company in this article. Callme has made it painfully obviously that he or she has a serious issue with the company and has decided to use this forum to paint the company in a negative light. Any post or change made by Sarah was in direct response to an over the top negative comment or information that was posted without citation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Callme also continues to engage in hyperbole <i>(To illustrate the difference, I don't think an article about Stalin would need to be neutral in content to have a neutral point of view as he did deplorable things that history judges him for. Similarly an article about Mother Teresa would not need to be neutral in content to have a neutral point of view.)</i>, which really adds little to the discussion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Additionally, comments such as this: <i>By the way, people have to pay Angie's List first before they know whether it is valuable to them or not, and like a patient getting a placebo, just because some may think it's valuable doesn't make it so.</i> don't help the situation. It is not the job of the article to sway someone's position one way or another, but simply to provide individuals with information about the services that the company provides. Based on this information, that person can decide whether or not they want to join Angie's List.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I also think that it's ironic that you accuse Sarah of recruiting other Angie's List members to post for her, and yet both your IP address and that of Callme's both come from Kansas City.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I really think that at this point, the whole page should be removed because it's obvious that no middle ground is going to be reached.TCFC 20:26, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, ironic, but not as ironic as someone who is not an Angie's List employee checking the IP addresses of their critics? Whoops&#160;:)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Look, the article has been peer reviewed and all the statements are supported with reliable sources under WP policy. You wanted to add information and an objection was raised as to npov with explanations. Nearly a month passed and no one expressed support for your changes nor did you respond to any of the objections. So, quit crying about it. The simple solution would be for your company to be more forthcoming about the information it releases.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Again I say, Call me did you a favor, by pointing out the problems with your suggestions. Your cititations don't exactly create a positive spin for Angie's List from a member's perspective. One article states that you use your 200 employees to keep a watch out for those who would give businesses a negative review. The same article also states that that's not good enough for one business, who checks to make sure the information is reported accurately. Well, what happens if a business claims it isn't accurate or you think you have identified a member who posts a negative review you think is bogus? Hmmm? If you pull the review, its no longer the members, but Angie's List who determine the business' rating since you really don't know if it is bogus or not. So now you are in the business of judging which reviews are acceptable and which ones are not while at the same time accepting money from the businesses you review. You are accepting money from members on the premise that your system is honest opinions from those who use the contractors. You need to be more open about exactly what your policies are, and you wouldn't get so much grief. 64.151.41.50 01:10, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As I said before, it has become blatantly obvious that both you and Callme have a serious axe to grind with the company. What you fail to grasp is that this is not the forum in which those issues should be addressed. Callme has repeatedly posted information in the article that is nothing more than conjecture aimed at hurting the reputation of the company. I (and maybe others agree with me) feel that he or she is abusing what the purpose of this page should be (and just to be clear, I would feel the same way if Sarah or anyone at the company was using this page as a platform to promote Angie’s List).</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>IMO, the page should consist of two paragraphs. One containing the history of the company and the other being what the company publicly states that it does. It is not the job of you or me or anyone to determine <b>on this page</b> whether or not the company actually does what it says it does. If you are so concerned about questioning the way in which the company operates, I suggest that you take it up with the company directly, or go start a blog where you can question the motives of the company all you want. There are plenty of places on the internet where people can find both positive and negative information on the company, but this page should not be a harbor for either.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And I really don’t care if you can find cited information that questions what the company does unless you are willing to concede that for every negative entry on the page, there should be an equally positive review of the company posted. The problem you then run in to is that the article is rendered useless because it has become nothing more than a pissing match.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>At least Sarah has been honest from the outset that she is an employee of the company. I really think that it is ridiculous for you and Callme to attack her because she is trying to defend the company that she works for. I’m sure you would do the same if someone publicly attacked the way in which your business was run by posting incorrect and inaccurate information.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What are your motives here? You and Callme continually attack Sarah and her motives, but not one time has she done the same to you. It would be very easy for someone to accuse you of being a competitor or of simply being the operator of a company that received a less than flattering review on Angie’s List and is now trying to get back at the company. Other than those two reasons, I fail to see why anyone would be so hell-bent on trying to portray the company in a negative light.TCFC 14:26, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Sorry for adding a dose of logic into this discussion, but if those are the only two reasons someone would protray a company in a negative light, then all the negative reviews on Angie's List must be from competitors since the other reason doesn't seem to be applicable. There are two obvious alternatives you left out: 1. disgruntled employees or ex-employees and 2 former customers of yours that weren't too impressed with Angie's List. I suppose they could just be community minded, but who really buys that. They must have an agenda of some sort to protray a company in a negative light.</p>
<p>But let's move off this topic, because I'm pretty sure its against WP policy to attack others or question their motives and anyone can accuse anyone else of an agenda if they don't like their opinion. So how about everyone knock it off. There probably isn't a single person on here without any bias or an agenda of some sort. For all I know there are only two people on this board or a single person with serious case of multiple personalities.</p>
<p>So back to the article... TCFC, your opinion that you think the article should be nothing more than history of the company and public statements the company would seem to run afoul of the prohibition against adveritising, since that would be all that is left. Furthermore, NPOV does not require a positive statement for every negative statement. Try applying that standard to the article on Hitler. "He murdered millions in the holocost, but he was really nice to his puppy." You misunderstand NPOV means. There is plenty of positive things in this article about Angie's List, most of the sources cited cast the company in a very generous light, perhaps a little too generous in many cases. The parts you probably do not like have citations to reliable sources, so why don't you discuss what you don't like about the article. LonnieR 00:06, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you for your input 64.151.41.50. I can understand how you would think I would want to spin this article since I am an employee of Angie's List. If I were you I might think the same thing. However, I am trying to follow Wiki policy and guidelines which is why I sought out sources which are reliable and also why I have requested additional input. If anyone questions the reliability of the sources I provided because they may include interviews with employees (even Angie herself) please refer to <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>. You may be of the opinion that these are ridiculous statements, but that doesn't change the fact that they are printed in reliable sources and are actually written by someone outside of the company. I would welcome you, or anyone else, to offer additional sources to improve the article and work toward <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>.</p>
<p>I am offended that you assume I am soliciting other Angie's List employees to agree with me anonymously. I have been honest since the beginning. Call Me and I obviously have very strong opinions in opposite directions, which is why I asked for additional input on my suggestions. It seems you have a very strong opinion against Angie's List as well. I respect your opinions, but Wikipedia is not the place to express them. Please refer to <a href="../../../t/p/g/WP%7ETPG_5557.html" title="WP:TPG">WP:TPG</a> for the Talk Page guidelines. I would like to keep this discussion on track and productive. The purpose of the talk page is to discuss ways to improve the article, not opinions on the subject of the article.</p>
<p>I will try to respond to some of the objections and questions raised above where it is productive for the discussion and improvement of the article.</p>
<ul>
<li>1. True, some of the reviews will be older than others. We've been operating for over 11 years so there will be reviews that are 11 years old. That's still 500 reviews. Perhaps the company has been providing good service for the past 11 years and those 500 reviews demonstrate that. I may be more concerned with the most recent reviews, but it's still reassuring if a company has been getting good reviews that long. Regarding the fact that some reviews may have come from free members, the fact that we require all members to register helps maintain the integrity because it allows us to see who is submitting the reviews. I provided this source in response to this misleading statement in the article "companies like Angie's List suffer from few reviews per company listed." You can either add my source to create a balanced perspective, or you can remove this line completely.</li>
<li>2. This is part of our membership agreement. People caught violating are revoked from membership. It's just one of the steps we take. I've already cited sources for the other steps we take.</li>
<li>5. I'm not sure how your point is helping the article and there are no reliable sources discussing this policy. I will tell you that the member decides if he/she thinks the issue is resolved. If he/she is satisfied with the resolution it would not be fair to leave the original, negative report. Why would a company want to try to resolve an issue if the negative report would remain on their record?

<li>6. Yes, I could probably find that data (or someone could), but if it doesn't come from a reliable source what difference does it make? (Not that I don't consider myself a reliable source, but I wouldn't be for purposes of Wikipedia.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>64.151.41.50 stated, "By the way, people have to pay Angie's List first before they know whether it is valuable to them or not, and like a patient getting a placebo, just because some may think it's valuable doesn't make it so." People pay to sign up based on what they know and if they think it will be valuable to them. If they later decide it is not valuable to them they can cancel, ask for a refund, not renew, etc. Some find it valuable and continue to renew year after year. Others may not find it valuable, for various reasons (they aren't doing work on their house, already know good service companies, or may not like the information we offer). However, the opinion on whether or not Angie's List is a valuable service, does not belong in the article unless it is cited in a reliable source. I believe many of the sources I cited show people who find it valuable as well as people who don't. To find value in something is relative to personal needs and taste - I'm not sure this is an encyclopedic matter. Should it even be presented in a Wikipedia article?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Well, what happens if a business claims it isn't accurate or you think you have identified a member who posts a negative review you think is bogus? Hmmm? If you pull the review, its no longer the members, but Angie's List who determine the business' rating since you really don't know if it is bogus or not. So now you are in the business of judging which reviews are acceptable and which ones are not while at the same time accepting money from the businesses you review." You don't know what happens if a business claims a report isn't accurate and you have no reliable source that states our practice, so please don't speculate on this matter. I have also suggested several times that the line "though Angie's List ultimately controls a company rating" be removed because it is unsourced. It is based on this same speculation.</li>

<p>Milo, thanks for working on improving the article. I have a comment on your recent edit. The quote from the NY Times article refers to review sites in general, not Angie's List specifically. I think that somehow needs to be clarified. Also, it's not entirely accurate to say "smaller cities where it has been operating longer." Some of the cities where we've been operating longest and have many reviews I wouldn't call small (eg. Columbus, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Tampa Bay, Charlotte, Indianapolis, Boston). They may not be the largest cities, but small is misleading. Maybe that sentence would be better if we just eliminated the word "smaller." I'm open to feedback. Thanks! <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarahER_b941.html" title="User:SarahER">SarahER</a> 12:51, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Actually the article says that they have more LISTINGS not more REVIEWS in smaller cities where it has been operating longer. The previous version of this section is also more accurate and better writing. Few reviews per company listed is another way of saying that the reviews are thin or spotty.
