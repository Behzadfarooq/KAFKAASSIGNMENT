<h2><span class="mw-headline">IPA</span></h2>
<p>Hi, Angr! I noticed that you are busy with updating IPA symbols in the Irish language-related articles. I see that the articles become more precise (and useful!) after your edits, but I am having helluva time sorting out a good portion of the new transcriptions, and I probably am not alone.</p>
<p>Would it be too much to ask you to write an article similar to <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Phonetic_Alphabet_for_English_4b7c.html" title="International Phonetic Alphabet for English">International Phonetic Alphabet for English</a>, only for Irish? Or is there another place where I can look just for Irish-specific symbols without having to filter through loads of IPA symbols that are irrelevant to the Irish language?</p>
<p>I understand that to write <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Phonetic_Alphabet_for_Irish_8b10.html" title="International Phonetic Alphabet for Irish">International Phonetic Alphabet for Irish</a> is going to be a lot of work, but once it's up there, it will be invaluable to learners like me.--<a href="../../../a/g/_/User%7EAg_Foghlaim_ee64.html" title="User:Ag Foghlaim">Ag Foghlaim</a> 15:03, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd rather keep information like that at <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_phonology.html" title="Irish phonology">Irish phonology</a>.

<dd>Thanks, I see your point. I'd better come back when I can formulate my questions better. While I know that there is something missing at <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_phonology.html" title="Irish phonology">Irish phonology</a>--something that I need for better understanding of Irish IPA transcription--I for some reason can't pinpoint what it is. I guess I'd better go back to the drawing board, brush up on my linguistic terminology skills (or, rather, lack thereof), and figure out what exactly <i>is</i> that which I so desperately need&#160;:) Thanks for the to-do list clue, though; I'll keep it in mind.--<a href="../../../a/g/_/User%7EAg_Foghlaim_ee64.html" title="User:Ag Foghlaim">Ag Foghlaim</a> 15:19, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This might just be it! Figuring out the difference between <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">bˠ</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">b</span> wasn't terribly hard, but some of the other symbols were more elusive. If you could compile a table in image of the prototype above, you would have my eternal gratitude... or wait, did I already promise that to you in the past?&#160;:)</p>
<p>As for location, Wikipedia namespace should probably do fine, although I am not sure where exactly is the best place to put it. Wherever it's going to be, once it's ready, I'm going to print it out and meditate on it for the next few days&#160;:)--<a href="../../../a/g/_/User%7EAg_Foghlaim_ee64.html" title="User:Ag Foghlaim">Ag Foghlaim</a> 18:25, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is absolutely fantastic! How much do I owe you now?&#160;:)</dd>
<dd>I also have a related question. I don't remember if it was you who told me that or if I read it elsewhere, but, if I remember correctly, the pronunciation of letter "l" depends on its lenition/eclipsis. While in writing this letter is never modified, its pronunciation actually differs if it stands in a position where another lenitable/eclipsable letter would be lenited/eclipsed. An example would be <i>in aice leis an lampa</i>, which is along the same lines as <i>in aice leis an gcoláiste</i>. First of all, is that true at all, or is it something different that I completely misunderstood? Second, if its true, does the strict version of IPA provide any means to show the difference in pronunciation of letter "l" in various positions?--<a href="../../../a/g/_/User%7EAg_Foghlaim_ee64.html" title="User:Ag Foghlaim">Ag Foghlaim</a> 14:06, 13 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>How much you owe me depends on if you want to pay in cash or sexual favors... As for L, there are only some dialects where it's pronounced differently under lenition than otherwise. If you look at the table in <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_phonology.html#Fortis_and_lenis_sonorants" title="Irish phonology">Irish phonology#Fortis and lenis sonorants</a> you'll see rows for <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">Lˠ</span>, <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">Lʲ</span>, <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">lˠ</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">lʲ</span> in Old Irish, and their modern correspondents in the three main dialects. Under lenition, the modern counterpart of <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">Lˠ</span> becomes the modern counterpart of <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">lˠ</span>, while the modern counterpart of <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">Lʲ</span> becomes the modern counterpart of <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">lʲ</span>. (The same thing holds for N, by the way.) However, being dental consonants, L and N don't undergo lenition after the definite article anyway, so you use the unlenited pronunciation in <i>don lampa</i>. And L and N aren't affected by eclipsis at all, so <i>ár lampa</i> is no different from ordinary <i>lampa</i>. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 14:16, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Being straight myself, I think I'll prefer the cash option&#160;:) How about I make a cash donation to Wikimedia Foundation on your behalf? If you prefer another arrangement, I'll see what I can do.</dd>
<dd>Thanks for pointing me to the appropriate section in Irish phonology. I saw that you added it recently, but I didn't bother reading it thinking it was only applicable to Old Irish. That section and your comments above clarified the issue for me somewhat; now I only wish I could actually hear how these sounds are different in real speech! You wouldn't happen to know any Irish Wikipedians I could pester so they could record a "soundtrack" to Irish phonology and to the dialect-specific articles?--<a href="../../../a/g/_/User%7EAg_Foghlaim_ee64.html" title="User:Ag Foghlaim">Ag Foghlaim</a> 14:36, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>I apologize about the footnotes - I am using AndyZ's semi automated peer review and am not 100% sure how to add the footnotes. It was helpful when I went through peer review and I thought it was a shame no one was doing it now, so I tried to be helpful and did it for the 10 oldest requests without a semiautomated peer review. I tried adding a reference section to the <a href="../../../p/r/_/WP%7EPR_690c.html" title="WP:PR">WP:PR</a> page, but that did not work. I need to look at my old peer review and see how AndyZ did it - there was a link to a page with the semi automatic peer review on it and the footnotes were there.

<p>Hi, Angr! Sorry for bothering you again--it looks like I'm on a roll today! Just wanted to quickly check something. <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_phonology.html#Fortis_and_lenis_sonorants" title="Irish phonology">Irish phonology#Fortis and lenis sonorants</a> provides the transcription for <i>coll</i> and <i>sonn</i>. Per <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_orthography.html" title="Irish orthography">Irish orthography</a>, the vowels should be long, but I see that the phonology to-do list states that you are still to work on materials about "lengthening before fortis sonorants". Is that why the pronunciation is different from what Irish orthography prescribes? Would that apply to words such as <i>poll</i> and <i>donn</i> as well?

<dd>That section refers to the <i>Old</i> Irish words <i>coll</i> and <i>sonn</i>, and there was no lengthening in Old Irish. The modern Irish words <i>coll, sonn, poll, donn</i> do have lengthening (in the dialects where lengthening happens at all; in Donegal and Mayo it doesn't happen before ll and nn). —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 20:44, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's okay... your comments are good at letting me know what needs to be made clearer.

Incidentally, if you go to your CSS settings and set lang=ga and lang=sga to different colors or different fonts or something, you'll be able to see what's marked as being modern Irish and what is marked as being Old Irish. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 20:53, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Tapping and flapping</span></h2>
<p>Taps and flaps are two different things, and in English, we have taps, not flaps. Yes, many people mix the terms up, even in published papers, and "flap" is the more popular term to describe both phenomena when using one term to cover both, but that doesn't make that usage correct! This lax usage is explained in the <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flapping.html" title="Flapping">Flapping</a> article. In an encylcopedia article, isn't it much better to be accurate, than to just blindly follow the herd?<a href="../../../l/i/u/User%7ELiuLanDi_a0ad.html" title="User:LiuLanDi">LiuLanDi</a> 08:58, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Nope. As an encyclopedia, rather than a linguistics journal, Wikipedia follows whatever the most common usage is. Obviously it's important to explain the difference in the article where it's discussed, but because the phenomenon is known virtually universally in the linguistics literature as "flapping", we should stick to that terminology when discussing it in other articles too. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 09:01, 19 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Maybe I haven't read as much on the subject as you have, but without digging through everything I've ever read on it, I seem to remember quite often that when I've encountered either term, both are mentioned, and the writer states his preference before continuing the discussion. As for online mentions of the terms, Google hits: alveolar tap (190k), alveolar flap (212k), alveolar flap cleft (40.5k), so factoring out plastic surgery it looks like tap might be more common. Since I'm teaching in China, I don't have the resources to verify your statement "known virtually universally in the linguistics literature". And at present we aren't concerned with all of the linguistics literature, just English. You can't possibly argue that the term <i>tap</i> is not often found in the literature as well. Will you still be this dismissive?<a href="../../../l/i/u/User%7ELiuLanDi_a0ad.html" title="User:LiuLanDi">LiuLanDi</a> 11:38, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not saying taps are universally known as flaps. I'm saying the phonological process of North American English (and some varieties of Australian and Northern Irish English too) by which "pity" is pronounced <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ˈpɪɾi]</span> is almost universally known as "flapping", not "tapping". If you go to Google book search (which gives you a better idea of uses in the literature) and look for <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22flapping%22+%22American+English%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22flapping%22+%22American+English%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" rel="nofollow">"flapping" "American English"</a> you get 161 hits; <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22tapping%22+%22American+English%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22tapping%22+%22American+English%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" rel="nofollow">"tapping" "American English"</a> gets you only 107, and in most of those "tapping" is being used as a verb, not the name of the process ("Flap: A sound made by rapidly tapping the tip of the tongue to the alveolar ridge", "results from the tongue tip tapping quickly against the alveolar ridge") and usually in a context unrelated to the process ("one of the greatest advantages of a curriculum on dialects is its potential for tapping the language resources", "Once I was sitting on the subway when I heard a tapping ... When the tapping continued, the businessman sitting next to me poked my shoulder", "evidence that she had succeeded in tapping a more creole-like variety", "Tapping the vernacular") etc. If we could filter all of those out, we'd probably get about 1 instance of the phenomenon being called "tapping" for every 10 instances of it being called "flapping". —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 11:53, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Angr, you have one solid point: there's a lot of indiscriminate use of tap and flap in the literature. You win! &#160;:) But you shouldn't win, because taps and flaps are different! A tap should be when the tongue touches the alveolar ridge, and a flap should be when there is sliding movement across it. They have different sounds, and when I teach the tap in words like "pity" to my grad students, and they say it with a flap, it's ridiculous! I just tried Google Books but the damn Great Firewall of China is blocking it at the moment. Using "American English" is too general. That's why I used "alveolar". I still have to talk to you about diphthongs, so brace yourself! &#160;:) <a href="../../../l/i/u/User%7ELiuLanDi_a0ad.html" title="User:LiuLanDi">LiuLanDi</a> 13:04, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The trouble with using "alveolar" is it gets you too many general phonetics hits rather than hits relating directly to flapping as a phenomenon in (American) English. And about diphthongs, the same basic argument holds: the symbols <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/aɪ, aʊ, ɔɪ/</span> are simply those that are most widely used in IPA transcriptions (Kenyon &amp; Knott, Ladefoged, J.C. Wells, etc.). Using other transcriptions like <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɑi/</span> or whatever just because you think they're more accurate verges on <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> when it contradicts common usage. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 13:12, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

If you just use "tapping" "American English", then of course you're going to get the kinds of hits that you got—if you don't include "alveolar" with "tap" then "tap" could mean what it most commonly does. It's along the same reasoning that I filtered out "cleft" when it appears with "flap" because many of the hits were turning up talking about plastic surgery on cleft palates using some sort of skin graft "flap". Let's talk about the diphthongs on the GenAm page where the chart is.<a href="../../../l/i/u/User%7ELiuLanDi_a0ad.html" title="User:LiuLanDi">LiuLanDi</a> 01:13, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And if you do include "alveolar" with "tap" then you're going to get pages discussing the sound, not the phonological process. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 07:15, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

The reference there is not directly to the <a href="../../../a/l/v/Alveolar_tap.html" title="Alveolar tap">alveolar tap</a> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɾ]</span> itself, but rather to the phonological process of American English by which the phoneme /t/ is realized as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɾ]</span> in certain environments. The reason the Wikipedia article on that process is called <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flapping.html" title="Flapping">Flapping</a> is that "flapping" is by far the most common name for it in the linguistic literature. Searching Google Books for <tt>"American English" flapping</tt> and <tt>"American English" tapping</tt>, and then filtering out the false positives, establishes the predominance of the name "flapping" for the process. Searching general Google for <tt>alveolar tap</tt> and <tt>alveolar flap -cleft</tt> will mostly get you hits where the sound <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɾ]</span> itself, rather than the phonological process /t/ → <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɾ]</span>, is discussed. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 13:23, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Got it. Thanks. The day before yesterday in my class I was talking about "tap" and caught myself saying "flap"! Anyway, in a class where I can demonstrate it and can check the students' pronunciation directly, it doesn't much matter what we call it.<a href="../../../l/i/u/User%7ELiuLanDi_a0ad.html" title="User:LiuLanDi">LiuLanDi</a> 14:22, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Interesting question. I think both 'Puirt a Beul' and 'Puirt a Bheul' are correct depending on the usage and both are used on gaelic pages/websites which pop up in the google searches.

<p>Hi Angr, I see you were involved in deletion of the Category:Minority languages (the CfD was closed and the deletion is going ahead as I'm writing this, apparently). I came too late to influence the vote. I can see your argument, but somehow I still think it's a pity, for some of these cases. What do you think, would it be a good idea to re-create such a category on a regional basis, like Category:Minority languages of Europe etc.? That way, we could decide on a per-world-region basis whether having such a category makes sense. I think in Europe it does, but I totally agree it might be quite a different case in other parts of the world. Just a thought, and comments appreciated. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 21:09, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think "minority language" would have to be well defined first. I think it would be silly to include German, even though it's a minority language in France, and Danish, even though it's a minority language in Germany, since German and Danish have "home countries" where they aren't minority languages. Perhaps a <a href="../../../e/n/d/Category%7EEndangered_languages_3487.html" title="Category:Endangered languages">Category:Endangered languages</a> would make more sense. Oh, I see that already exists. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 21:15, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, yes, you're right, cases where a major language serves as a minority language outside its own country would of course have to be excluded - except where the minority dialect has its own article, of course, like <a href="../../../k/v/e/Kven_Finnish_392f.html" title="Kven Finnish">Kven Finnish</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvanitika.html" title="Arvanitika">Arvanitika</a>, or <a href="../../../e/l/s/Els%C3%A4ssisch.html" title="Elsässisch">Elsässisch</a>. The category would, I think, not be coextensive with the endangered languages one, since some minority languages are (thank god) still solidly alive. But maybe it's also just a big new can of worms we shouldn't open, I'm not sure yet. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 21:30, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
