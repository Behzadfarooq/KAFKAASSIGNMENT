<p><small><small>Welcome to Wikipedia! KF 20 Feb 2003 -- It's not bad. Stan 21:49 -- WikiLove, MB -- Celebrate the woman in you.&#160;:-) Anthère -- Congratulations, you have just been made a sysop! Sysops basically can't do anything. Eloquence 17 Jun 2003 -- Commiserations. jimfbleak -- Yours seems to have vanished. Koyaanis Qatsi -- You've hit the rare but deadly Simultaneous Edit Bug.&#160;:( Brion -- Don't let it go to waste...a migraine headache. Pizza Puzzle -- Beautiful. Koyaanis Qatsi -- Very bad. 172 -- I'm a developer not a developer. Tim Starling -- If you know how to, I would thank you very much. Davichito. -- Apologies. Jim -- Stephen Crane, John Steinbeck etc. Notheruser -- Amnesia ...it happens to the old. Menchi -- Who Moved My Cheese? Notheruser -- Link = Bad. Dragons flight -- I assumed it was allowed. LDan -- I didn't see anything. LDan -- Linking to Wikiquote is great. Hephaestos -- Answer the question of the simple wiki's true purpose. Stevertigo -- Money well spent...The link you posted does not work, but I believe you. Tiles -- Thanks for adding yourself to the Psychopathology WikiProject! Vaughan -- Off to meta...sv -- Love your user page! We seem to be going around and around in circles. What do we want and when do we want it. FearÉIREANN -- How is the logo contest going to be fair? Tonius -- I do use the preview button. Tonius -- I appreciate the help! Jwrosenzweig -- I was wondering about your redirect. StinKerr -- Thanks for the link to Ships Project I'm looking at it. StinKerr -- Good idea. go raibh maith agat. -Steve -- Er, "stating views" with RK is kinda like "just be nice to the hyena." sv -- And yes its a load of nonsense, yes, Go to sleep, Avoid the Wikidrug. sv -- Then dinna be controversial - e'be tirin'. sv -- What actions, Angela? 172 -- A historian shouldn't care when these pages turn into garbage, right? 172 -- Please, don't fall for the crap spewed by this user. 172 -- I disagree with your rather pacifist assertion. One should not argue with a fool, or people wont be able to tell the difference. sv -- Make whiners sysops, and soon the whole project goes right to hell. 142.177 -- Someday work cordially on an article if our pursuits on Wiki ever coincide. 172 -- Give a tantrum child responsibility, and that child will grow into its new role. sv -- I will say it to his face when I work up the courage. sv -- Otherwise you would, by emperical evidence, have to be on speed to keep this up. sv -- I thought that the summary of my comments was a parody. 172 -- It's nice to see that you are using the flower I gave you. MB -- I'm not trying to change your mind here... MB -- Could you try and help Nostrum out? His major mistake was messing with the wrong crowd. MB -- Interlanguage links don't have a "correct" place. AstroNomer -- Well, now--that depends on who's asking, young lady. sv -- D'ye see me point m'Dear? sv -- 不是! 不是! Some stubs are better than others. sv -- IL links/usefulness - I respectfully disagree. sv -- I dont ask for much, but I ask that you support his nomination. sv -- You must say "Listed on Votes for deletion" mav -- Your deletion was premature. Oliver P. -- I got cold feet immediately after I got a user account KRS -- Am I to assume that any reference to the birthplace of a famous individual is an irrelevant entry? Alex -- I'd say that qualifies you for an article. Stephen Gilbert -- Is this OK for the addition to Wikipedia:Deletion_policy Noel --I agree that it's not a good idea to discuss a single user at the pump Jwrosenzweig -- Maybe you could pester him a bit&#160;;) -sv --Languages suck. sv -- it's going to make conversion more difficult overall. Brion -- VfD- I'm horrified. so many people have left Wikipedia, but their departure also goes unnoticed. KF - meta ...its a sort of a wasteland, sv -- Dydw i dim dy difalch gwas? Sv -- yo simplemente lo nombrará "Griego" sv -- I just discovered Wikipedia a couple of days ago, I am realy amazed. -Steve -- Can't that page be protected? Alex756 -- What happened with your studies in Software Engineering? MB -- My intention is to arrange a philosophical discussion among the greats Tonius -- I really doubt it now. 172 -- admin status can be revoked in a matter of minutes. 172 -- maybe you'll feel like coming back? I hope so.... Noel -- You are a dedicated Wikipedian and I hope you'll be back.&#160;;-( — Alex756 -- What happened to your userpage? Viajero -- I quit. Angela. 25 Aug -- Please stick around! Viajero -- Do you know anything about aumism? Anthère -- I hope you decide to stick around -- you've always been a voice of sanity around here. Eloquence -- one voice of sanity is not enough when everyone else is mad. Angela -- Who is mad, I'll kill em&#160;;). MB -- I'd like to welcome you to the madhouse again. KF -- Perhaps I shouldn't let the vandals get to me Angela -- go mad yourself. Join the party. Has a banned user really been nominated for sysop staus? Oliver P. -- leaving Wikipedia is a sure sign of madness. Oliver P. -- Impeccable Vulcan logics. Menchi -- the wonders of Wiki will always overwhelm its imperfection. Menchi -- Missing Wikipedians . sv -- I am not Pizza Box. 212. -- When I am really mad at the french, I come here. I am terribly sentimental about people I appreciate&#160;:-) Anthère -- Take a good breath of the WikiLove flower above&#160;:-) Anthère -- Viajero, I really hope you’re not Lir. Angela -- I was wondering why you'd deleted yourself. Tut-tut-tut.&#160;;-) Martin -- I have made several dumb mistakes. kkawohl -- Kurt, read List of central issues and then bug the editors. EofT -- reverting RK's ban page is a serious mistake. It is revolting in the extreme to watch otherwise intelligent people fall for it. EofT. -- This is not a schoolyard. secret letters to himself no less. You are erasing the memory of Wikipedia. EofT -- Perhaps you should read Nineteen Eighty-Four again. EofT -- Wow, it certainly didn't take you long to get back into the heat of things MB -- To have you depart also without making some attempt to redefine what makes this mass of text acceptable as an encyclopedia, would be the true tragedy. We were here working together "for a reason", your friend EofT -- Thanks for sticking up for me. Alex -- I think 172 is fair game for this kind of joshing. Alex -- not that 172 is an evil dictator. I can see why you were thinking of leaving. Alex. -- you just sliped seven points further into Wikipediholicism (Q53)&#160;;) -- sannse -- I got 200 points for the question that cannot be asked. sv -- "huh?" %\ hm? what might have provoked her to leave? took a look at db query page. sv -- 不是.坏询问。-戴眩sv -- ps. 您怎么知道?感谢, 英国-生的甜妇女。 sv -- I'd like to show them to you. Wikibi -- Trolls request your review of ethics, as you have recently had ethical disputes with trolls. Yum! neh neh neh 142 -- You were the first to five us the info Anthère. -- there should be something that discourages people from removing the copyvios and then rewriting the page. Alex -- Systransoft.com was buggin or something. Faker SV -- Actually, yeah, I just realized that. MB -- Signing other people's comments is entirely reasonable Martin -- yup, that is ok to me&#160;:-) Anthère -- Thank you for the fix and the welcome! Fourprint -- I do not know if EoT is banned right now. It is just basic politeness to allow the different editors in a dispute to express themselves. Anthère -- I am an oil paper lamp. Don't forget to sleep to fill up the lamp. Anthère -- several users have been quite rude to newbies, some newbies have even left. If you can help at that moment, that will be very greatly appreciated Anthère. -- dont delete those! Jiang -- Please stop vandalising other peoples' work. Heine -- keep him from vandalizing them. RickK -- Everything under control? its late almost 9pm here! Stevertigo -- Thank you for letting me wade into the Heine user-page festival. Zippy -- I disagree with you...but only in principle. TravelingDude -- this looks like it should fix things. RK -- You just run rebuildlinks.php. Give me a day or two. Whoa, hang on. they're 300 MB. Okay, try this. Tim Starling. -- make sure they are good Simple articles hoshie -- it would be nice to avoid that happening. Noel -- I appreciate your patience, and I am amazed by your speed. Hawstom -- Thank-you for your advice, I'm a new user. Dr Blix. -- how do you get your handy statistics? Not manually, I'm sure Cyan -- either way is probably fine. Hephaestos -- The french user I told you about returned today. Anthère -- I went and did it again...I really am not trying to cause trouble. Tom -- I have posted a reply on VfD. Cyan -- I am just a "bit" disgusted. A big bit. Anthère -- True, but i'd meant it in a specific (unclear) way. Kwantus -- Eloquence has done this before...assumed the role of Wiki God. Jtdirl -- you are defaming me on another user's talk page. Eloquence. -- I can be a bit stubborn sometimes...Eloquence is a good and capable participant but his 'I am God' moments really really piss off a lot of people. Thanks for the support. FearÉIREANN -- The person playing God here are you, James. You have big problems. Eloquence. -- See what I mean about his God Complex! Typical Eloquence. FearÉIREANN -- Hello... this is really not the place to have this argument. Angela. -- I am proud to be in the last 11. Anthère -- its 8:15 am in London? Ah. listen to the body though. Oh jeesh what am I turning into...Heres a t-shirt: got sleep? sv -- how do you like it to be posted to the ML? Looxix. -- the other William Bowyer was a printer also. Hephaestos -- I have just added myself to the Cleaning department. Cyan -- I am confused ...I want to know if this is wrong for some reason. Cyan -- Check out the solution I devised. Cyan -- I have asked Brion to unmix the edit histories ...I don't want you to think I've been talking about you behind your back. Cyan. -- you could be right. I'm just anal retentive. Cyan. -- Re: grumpy. I always (try to) assume good faith. Cyan. -- Thanks for the welcome message and the link to the verifiability page. Rhsatrhs -- I was not aware that pages could be undeleted...Ancient Rome directory...I had real fun. Muriel Gottrop -- p.s Great user page you have! Muriel. -- Good move... a very good idea (and not just because I suggested it. FearÉIREANN -- sorry. I'm an idiot. I'm a moron and put a notice thingy up without knowing you had already deleted it. Evil saltine -- lol er... thanks&#160;:p Evil saltine. -- Still up eh? Zaijian. sv -- more work is required...Pity! David Martland -- it's very important not to click on cur or last David Martland -- Eloquence indicates that content has been deleted, which is all I really desire. I'll give way. Martin -- I took care of it. I like your talk page summarization technique so much, I think I'll steal it. Cyan -- I'll go tell Brion. Cyan -- Please don't mind the foul comment made to you ...True Wikipedians appreciate a lady like you here. -- Menchi -- lately, no matter what I do, it's wrong. RickK -- something we were all projecting back in the heady early days of the net. Kudos all around. Patrick Jennings -- I hate to clutter your nice page. Hawstom -- Your vigilance is appreciated. Opus33 -- I would like to protest. Anthère -- I have no idea what kind of dash I'm using. john -- You wanna hear about typical...Cimon Avaro -- Zaijian=SYL.&#160;:) If I meant that, I would have added myself SV -- various types of polymerization...appreciate it if you could glance over them. PolymerTim -- U sure my name is offensive. Illiterate Cow -- YOU ROCK!!! hoshie -- zuperlong UTF links are a problem, aint they? sv -- I certainly wouldn't have caught it if I hadn't been watching Recent Changes. He's blaming the "software". RickK -- Someone else keeps deleting my stuff...In case he deletes it again, I will print it here...please do something about this nusance? Corey -- I didn't do it. Adrian -- Thanks for talking to the person. Camembert -- your automated test inspired me. Bang on it with IE or something else. Merphant. -- unlike anything in my years of experience on the net...I assumed that you were directly involved. Robert Taylor -- Ho hum. Martin -- perhaps you would welcome a little cricket on your talk page. Anthère -- take a bunch of newbies, and teach them. Anthère -- This is such a wonderful page, I hesitate to tiptoe on it. Anthère -- he's a troll. RickK. -- otherwise, I will be fiiiiiiired. Anthère -- I have never seen it being spelled "metre". BL -- Thanks a LOT!!!! Ilyanep -- now I don't feel like a disjointed head! Graham -- I created the page.&#160;:) RickK -- he was added to list of composers by the man himself. Camembert -- Whoops.. nevermind. sorry. Evil saltine -- you're doing great job here&#160;:) Slawojarek -- I hereby officially authorize you to use SQL. Eloquence -- Gettin' a buzz. Brion. -- "it is" and it's mean the same thing. Jay. -- I googled him. Lunchboxhero -- my innovative kloodge is a mere stopgap pending deletion. Jerzy -- we call the pictured beast a grasshopper. Jerzy. -- Thanks for itsing Serbian articles. Nikola -- I did it the french way. Anthère -- I don't understand Wikkiways. jonhays -- Don't use minor edits. Kingturtle -- I'm becoming a bit of an addict,&#160;:). - Kaet -- maybe I'll get wiki with it. jonhays -- I do think I'll like it here. Shawn Dessaigne -- De nada. Youssef -- I also don't want to get into an edit war:-). KRS -- it was just spam. Tacvek -- I brought the limit down. Brion -- I consider it an abuse of power. 80.225.30.236. -- One can but hope. RickK -- I always let them where they already are. Traroth -- I didn't know there's a Greek Wikipedia! Gakrivas -- writing that lets administrators chose however they want to delete articles is dangerous. BL -- Thanks to you and BuddhaInside, the problem will be fixed. Cyan. -- Indeed -BuddhaInside -- You'd be banned within two seconds of someone telling Eloquence.&#160;;-) Cyan -- disabled notification for anonymous user talk pages. Eloquence -- Don't delete blah McDuck stuff. Secretlondon -- I've decided to refrain. sugarfish -- wonderful images...less than ideal. Martin -- Wik seems to have a war against me. Antonio Wik's unobtainable fantasy Martin. -- it meant a lot to me... doesnt mean Im abusing my powers. Antonio From the Heart Martin. -- I will not do 2 editions just to be sure my vote will be considered. Traroth -- good grief, I just realized that I can do just about anything. Mark -- you're not a real Wikipedian until you've been listed as a vandal or problem user. Angela. -- Does that also include being suspected as a banned user? Viajero -- I am very impressed about your dedication, your experience and your kindness. Without persons like you a project like Wikipedia would never develop. You deserve a lot of flowers. Chris K -- You have apparently scuttled my attempt. Jeantet -- I have been blocked. Nice name!! Angelo -- I took the liberty of unblocking them. Hephaestos. -- Grunt. Snort. sv -- thanks for all the support, babes! ...are you a firewoman? Antonio Unvirginal Martin -- The politically correct term is "fire fighter". Cyan -- I think the juxtaposition of the two quotes is funny. RickK -- Just writing to say Hello. Michael Reiter -- I have explained moving that vanity contributor from Vandalism in progress. Cyan -- There are too many stubs...I simply want to make a protest. wshun -- I see you've been hard at work! Noel -- ..."consensus" (whatever that means)...Alex756 -- glad you didn't really fix it to 1938. Jerzy -- worst of all is a righteous person who doesn't know he's wicked. Cyan -- It's good to have someone checking up. Someone else -- It isn't possible to move a page if there is already a redirect there? Adam Bishop -- sure, sysophood is fine with me. Stan -- I expected when I wrote Möller's law that it would be deleted shortly, no offense taken. Dante Alighieri -- I wrote Deletion fog to note a comment about the deletion log. Rickyrab -- Huh? I thought you said links to subsections didn't work? Noel -- Dunnnh! Finally my brain turned on, or something. Thank you, your grace. Noel -- i need to take a page out of the above comment by Dante...When i first started I had a VfD ...the 'elemental beast that is wiki , capricious and forgiving and appearing a draconian at times (according Cimron) is a hard creature to come to terms with. Norwikian -- Sorry for misrepresenting you on problem users. Martin -- might be a possible candidate for the main page. Viajero -- Google bears it out. Hephaestos -- are you sure this isn't Michael? Rickyrab -- I'm sure that Hephaestos is NOT Michael! Rickyrab -- Michael has had a number of aliases that are named after Hephaestos. Arno -- This is a cricket right? Anthère -- what was there to merge? TwoOneTwo -- Seems Berlios is down, muwhahhhaahahaaa. Cimon -- Nice flowers. Very soothing. sv -- delete these 5 pages. BCorr -- Did I put it somewhere I should not have? 2toise -- That probably means it's time to go to bed! 2toise -- I am curious to know how quoting Kant himself on counts as nonsense (unless you subjectively believe everything Kant wrote was nonsense?). Malenor -- Imagine my shock to look at the Recent Updates to see that someone else had edited Vista, California. Eric with a c -- I'm very glad of this experience. Good luck! Twice25 -- Please don't set that cricket onto me!! Norwikian -- OK, but if you ever have time. sv -- What'f I have? Wots it tooye? sv -- Didnt mean to get carried away...tie up some of me loose ends dear? sv -- Have fun at work...Ive never been one of those people to sit by VFD. sv -- that should be deleted as well. Smith03 -- I don't intend to unrevert; I didn't know there was discussion and consensus on it. Hephaestos -- I'll use the Cleanup page from now on. Hephaestos -- Don't feel guilty, you did your job. Tim Starling. Apology accepted. mav -- do I go on reverting till someone take "pity" and offer me a better title? Anthère -- Foo! Any TLA is going to have more than one expansion! Noel -- your hypothetical may not be as unlikely as you think. Noel -- sorry. I'll do it from now on. Evil saltine – I was not attacking you personally. And I apologize. Kingturtle -- Thanks, the main page now work well. Elnoyola -- I hope nobody saw it. Elnoyola -- We, the Hungarian editors cannot do anything about it. Ralesk -- But is necesary correct my terrible English. Miroslav Malovec -- I moved Frederik André Henrik Christian. No offense meant! Someone else -- some sleepless night I may avail myself of its soporific value. Someone else -- Spoilsport. Cyan -- It's all part of the fun of having an "alter ego" in the article namespace. Cyan -- is there some way of finding out if someone is using two or more usernames. G-Man -- I'll do that myself in future. MrJones -- Look again at the deletion log. Cyan -- He has a floating IP. why are things copied from www.conigliofamily.com not copyvios? RickK -- I find that inexplicable, very disturbing...and sad. Ark30inf -- I vowed not to allow that personal POV to get in the way. I defended the community against the antics of JoeM and BuddhaInside who were essentially trolling to try and prove hypocrisy and liberal POV here. I tried wikilove, I compromised, I tried to make suggestions. What do I see now? This community willing to be blatantly hypocritical. Ark30inf -- I will chill. I'm not angry just sort of sad. Ed Poor's vote just sort of tipped me over the edge. To me, NPOV is not dueling partisans, its people leaving partisanship at the door. Ark30inf --I was totally just about to do that. Cyan -- if regulars strongly oppose deletion, this needs to be debated further… I don't think saying that 2/3 voted for deletion is proper justification under our present policy. I'm not too heartbroken about it. Eloquence -- Indeed, it was Jimbo not Ed. Tim Starling -- When I unblocked the account, I was not a banned user. Anthère -- I thank you Angel for unblocking me. I hope Jimbo will not frown at …usually he has the final word. Anthère -- this all-capitalised style is a bit of an affectation. ONE makes no sense as it doesn't represent an acronym. Arwel -- Thanks for the quick reply on the issues around the main page. Pakaran -- are events listed on current events automagically added? Pakaran -- You are mistaken in saying the concept of a hereditarily finite set makes no sense. Michael Hardy -- there doesn't seem to be a consistent policy or a workable mechanism for recent deaths. David Martland -- I meant that like "a bad day and YET ANOTHER thing goes wrong. Sorry--twas underappropriate. 戴眩sv -- good work. I enjoy. god bless america. anon -- What's wrong with saying "public school"? CGS -- Good job! Lir -- I don't really mind what "space" it is in so long as people can see it. Adam Carr – Oops, sorry. Will put it right. 2toise -- Hang on - did you already fix it? Thanks! 2toise -- If it doesn't exist, it doesn't appear on the watchlist. Evercat -- It was a brilliant tactical move. --Two Halves -- I was trying to be funny, but thanks anyway and thanks for the good work you do around here. Smith03 -- get some sleep:)Smith03 – I wouldn't call reverting vandalism "editing". Evercat -- it made me hungry for Space cakes. I am compiling a list of possible Baby names, including 'Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark'. Paul Klenk -- I now have the handy link for later on my talk page, eh? Stan -- Answer on my talk page. Mav -- I should have removed it myself from the disputes page. Gustavf -- Well then, where are they? KF -- the policy on vfd seemed to be 'the more misspelled links, the merrier'. Will not do it again. 2toise – re: if you want to have a go at each other - do it elsewhere please Thanks! That's much better. Daniel Quinlan -- I want (on fr:) to merge two history. Looxix -- Thanks, I will be careful. -- Looxix -- I understand quite little (if not none) what 142 is trying to suggest. What is that 3 forks idea&#160;??? Anthère -- the content of some articles is not far from being insulting toward our intellectual abilities. Anthère -- be tough Angela. Do not ask Brion again wild deletions of the whole project. Anthère -- won't there be a "direct redirect" from link 1 to link 3? KRS -- I was added by the problem user I was reporting. Maximus Rex -- I already moved TOEFL … the SAT pages are kinda inconsistent … it's an issue of consistency vs. ease of use. zandperl --what about ETS? It's not worth an edit war over this…I'll go with what you say. zandperl – re: I am definitely not NPOV - &lt;chuckles&gt; ditto that. bitter grad student here, and you? zandperl --Thanks for your vigilance o panoptic one. Adam Carr -- No-one has any business editing another User's homepage. Adam Carr -- I tried, but this just isn't going to work out for me. Thank you for your assistance and support, you have been great. Ark30inf -- I'm not cut out for the encyclopedia wars. Its been a terrific experience, but one that becomes draining after a while when you're really not here to fight battles. Ark30inf -- Why is Jiang's version more sensible than mine? I am constantly subjected to this kind of nitpicking competitive pedantry. Adam Carr – delete the page. I made it as a vanity page. Kenneth Alansson -- if you revert, you'll be removing correct information … so I request that you don't. 80.255 -- Birmingham is not "in" the historic county of Warwickshire, any more than it is in Pangea. Andy Mabbett. -- My apologies for putting this comment here - unfortunately Pigsonthewing won't let me put it anywhere else. 80.255 -- A lie. Andy Mabbett -- Last night's kerfuffle over Warwickshire prompted me to take a look at some of the Welsh counties, and I'm horrified. Arwel -- some interactive discussion would help me. It may be a clear-cut and prosecutable fraud as well. Jerzy – I don't mind breaking thru my pseudonym individually to you. Jerzy -- should not you be in bed Angel&#160;? I corrected your page. No big deal you know&#160;:) Anthère – Wiwaxia essentially incorporated the entire GWB list of nicknames straight into George W. Bush. That greatly upset ark30inf …basically a joke in regards to neutrality. Minesweeper -- I left because of what many people do not do. Writing for the enemy should be demanded by the community… I don't think it really is. Ark30inf -- Nydigovoth is being a PIA. Viajero -- Daniel Quinlan stepped in to help out. Viajero -- I see a lot of deleting comments for no reason. Pakaran.-- I decided Datchet must be a house or castle or palace or widget or knick-knack. Tuf-Kat -- RickK, Wik and others are currently in the state of an edit war. Ruhrjung -- Something for the technical people, perhaps? David Martland -- Maybe there could be a refresh request page. David Martland -- The American Heritage Dictionary thinks it is pronounced 'Winzer'. Morwen -- we might say win-d-zor. David Martland -- Nydigovoth knows all the ropes. Viajero -- It was late last night and I got irritated by Nydigovoth's stupid antics. Viajero -- This list mania is really starting to annoy me. Muriel Gottrop -- I've called a vote on Mother Teresa. FearÉIREANN -- As far as I'm concerned, Warrington is in Cheshire. Arwel -- I would like this page to be unprotected. Kommiec -- Evil saltine had in fact done nothing wrong. Aplank -- I have considerable respect for your ability and neutrality. FearÉIREANN -- It has fallen off the radar screen. Fuzheado -- We have crossed the Rubicon... I've put the bold policy in place and let's see the arrows fly. Fuzheado -- For someone who has been accused of vandalism you sure are an angel! England to me seems like one of the most beautiful places in the world. Antonio Looking for an angel Martin -- There was never any danger that I was gone for good. Cyan -- I respect you and the work you do highly...I'm still a little nervous as a sysop, and don't want to abuse my power. Thanks for all you do here! Jwrosenzweig -- I appreciate your willingness to provide the second opinion: happy editing, Jwrosenzweig -- within 6 minutes of the creation of a new article called Friendliness Theory you voted for its deletion. Love, 207.112.29.2 -- I do not see why this city needs two boldface names. I can't change it since I am a known "Vandal" supposedly. 24.2.152.139 03:03 -- I wish Gdansk hadn't been unprotected. RickK -- Your continued hard work appreciated. Andrewa -- I've decided to be more circumspect about listing people there (only genuine Vandals and Visigoths). I am trying to rein Alun Ephraim in a bit and get him onto the True Path. Be careful of that Antonio - he has a Sweet &amp; Seductive way with words!!! Viajero -- this person has been causing trouble for anyone who writes on anything to do with Polish history. Adam -- Ark30inf seemed to be clearly upset with the article. I don't see what makes it "a monument to how bad Wikipedia can get". Wiwaxia -- wiwaxia, I'm no longer contributing to the project nor arguing about article content. Ark30inf -- I was not aware I was inadvertantly violating any rules. SD6-Agent -- Thanks, you beat me by a few seconds. Infrogmation -- I'm not a sysop on simple so I wouldn't know where to start. Cyan -- I don't know if hard-bans apply across Wikipedias. I guess that's an issue for Jimbo to clarify. Cyan -- Thanks, this 67 guy/girl is a bit rude! Muriel -- I am surprised by your edit of an intro I wrote. Moriori -- The "week in history" label was a compromise mav came up with. Jiang -- I've written and published an article about Wikipedia on Indonesia's online news site detik.com -- SihirHujan -- Wik immediately reverted it again. RickK -- there's already bad blood between me and Wik. RickK -- I don't think I even know what a proxy is. RickK -- I thought 1Angela was a lowlife causing trouble. Kingturtle -- just ask me to send you a "trick or treat" message Cimon Avaro on a pogostick -- You are my real angel&#160;!! Road Safety is a proper name of a field or management system. Cuye -- I do know that it is considered vandalism. SmartBee -- since I can't I might as well just vote as two people. SmartBee -- As if by magic, it now looks nice! vanden -- I've restored it for now, just to decipher what happened. Fuzheado -- I don't know all the pages in Wikipedia namespace by heart yet. Pakaran -- If it happens again, I'll re-block the address. RickK -- I was just coming to say the same thing. Adam Bishop -- O goddess of deletion, I seek your wisdom. Fuzheado -- seeing these oddball entries in there drives me a bit nuts. Fuzheado -- I guess I shouldn't have accused you of deleting my contributions. I'm sorry. ZyXoas -- Will be enough and enough with accordance to fair use rules, or not? Szopen -- Niceguy deleted the listings for Szopen and Nico. Viajero -- Martin no doubt would object ...while GrahamN would no doubt go ballistic and talk of cabals, undemocratic yada yada yada. But it is logical and sensible. FearÉIREANN -- he is trying to list every imaginable given name. Eclecticology -- it is very likely I know the password. Anthère -- You are cheating, and not respecting the policy. Anthère -- you are a sysop...to be at their service, trusted to respect the rules. Not even the sysops know all the rules, I am sure. But of course I forgive you. Anthère -- I am getting on quite well with them now despite issues of Polish nationalism etc. Adam -- This article has a grammatical error in its first sentence. Pakaran -- I took care of it. Cyan -- Is it an out of process deletion? Yes. Does it really matter? No. Are people going to make a big fuss? Yes. I'm all fussed out. Cyan -- This user, I have come to understand, is not our hardbanned friend EofT. Cyan -- I was sure that there was something else I had to do, just couldn't think of what. Zanimum -- Still trying to learn. Bmills -- How do you archive discussions O Wise One??? Viajero -- just thought mine was slightly nicer. Evercat -- It is nice to receive a welcome message from a real person. Gandalf61 -- Okay, you can try your SQL query now. Tim Starling -- That's why I get so mad at deletionists/axe-murders ~ender -- Much ado about nuthin'. Cyan -- I feel you have rewarded edit aggression. conradx -- I can assure you there was no personal attack intended against anyone. conradx -- there's seldom urgency about deleting things. JamesDay -- a listing on VfD is a poor welcome. JamesDay -- I forgot about the copyright/history issue. I'll fix it. Someone else -- we don't have to worry about how things got the way they are if everyone's happy with the way they are. Someone else -- I felt better knowing someone was looking over my shoulder. Gentgeen -- the localisation file on cy.wikipedia is nearly done. Arwel -- Indeed, this one does seem to have quite a bit to learn. JamesDay -- Yep, that's what I intended to happen; thanks! Khym Chanur -- Unfortunately there are two famous football managers called Peter Taylor. Mintguy -- My first Main Page edit... Stan -- Perhaps you could look and see if anything catches your eye. Viajero -- maybe it should really be kept, or maybe not. Tomos -- You're a sysop on meta, right? Could you take a look, I think Michael is vandalizing it? -- Cimon Avaro -- Well, I did mean to blackout Kwena. ZyXoas -- the good news is that I will have more time for simple perhaps. Antehre -- Niceguy is probably Nico. Viajero -- I was just wondering why the Google search engine doesn't show the results for newer articles. TopCamel -- Google takes a while to get new pages into their searches. RickK -- Do we really want to get into a legal battle over it? RickK -- I've contacted Ms. Greenberg, I will report on her response. RickK -- I was listed as a problem user for entirely frivolous and vexatious reasons. Adam -- Following Angela's advice (excellent advice as always), I have removed Problem Users from my watchlist. Mother Teresa ...seems beyond salvation by means of reasonble debate. Adam -- Normalizing that image -Nevermind. Daniel Quinlan -- The lovely picture labelled Trillium.jpg is not actually a Trillium. WormRunner -- I request that a reason be stated. TopCamel -- Illuminati Order, which you moved from vfd to vfd/copyvio, is being edited. Should it be reverted? Maximus Rex -- it is appreciated that you are helping a new Wikipedian. TopCamel -- I've been called a moron and brainwashed. Trontonian -- you might have to be a Canadian to understand why. Trontonian -- You are entitled to your point of view. DW -- that is an attack by you on me. DW -- I won't revert your deletions of Mathieugp. Trontonian -- I meant no personal attacks. I am well aware that this probably looks ridiculous from the outside. Mathieugp -- What you removed deserved to be removed. I have no complains. Mathieugp -- Please unblock the username Khranus. I'm getting tired of generating random IPs. Khranus -- please put Intel 4004 on front page. Wernher -- I'm still waiting to learn where his authority is for that. DW -- Where is your written authority to exclusively do that and where does that state that I can't? DW -- falls short of Wikilove, hugs, kisses etc. Don't you think? DW -- Please do what you think best regarding the Sandbox. Hephaestos -- Keep up the good work, Angela. Tim Starling -- Please participate in the new meta-article Naming conventions (Mormonism). BoNoMoJo -- You may want to add your voice to: Wikipedia talk:Don't include copies of primary sources mav -- are you sure your vote "Delete. The manual of style notes that this format is not advocated. on Time Dollars in VfD ended up attached to the vote-item you intended? Finlay McWalter -- Thanks for the undelete. I feel much better - kind of "validate" somehow. BTW, I blocked user:HeadCase. Uncle Ed -- P.S. Cunctator said I shouldn't have blocked him, so I unblocked him and his IP. Uncle Ed -- maybe Illuminati would find somewhere else to contribute, and wouldn't feel like I and a bunch of others were ganging up on him. Pakaran -- Never mind, he seems fairly quiet now. And BTW I no longer feel that he is a return of Khranus. Pakaran -- This was more wondering than my entry into Freemasonry! Illuminati -- It seems there are those who fear you more than they fear Jimbo Wales. It seems those include Ed Poor and Stevertigo. Cimon Avaro -- You're way scarier than Jimbo. Cyan -- Please investigate. PeterManchester -- By the way, love the British accent. Antonio Raven Martin -- my dyslexia really fooled me. Kingturtle -- As a Sysop, you have a responsibilty to account for your actions. DW -- Vandals can't get eaten by Anthère's cricket anymore? Mattworld -- It's very ill after having had to deal with Khranus and NightCrawler. Angela -- boooooo&#160;:-(( indigestion. Anthère -- I'm fairly confident that you shouldn't be feeding it either dog-poop or sad lonely little men whose fathers never loved them. Finlay McWalter -- I recall seeing crickets being fed chunks of potato. Chris Roy -- I didn't realize that flowers only give one wikilove. Alexandros -- now I can't protect. Crap. Sorry. Cyan -- Ditto for Freemasonry. Cimon Avaro on a pogostick -- I think that went well, don't you? Cyan -- The comment was supposed to be about Dolphin brain. Pakaran -- my concern was that the ice cream article now links vanilla sex. Pakaran -- I think writing articles is more productive than criticizing people. Pakaran -- Thanks for protecting Mecca. RickK -- Yes thanks. A little while is fine. Hephaestos -- Perhaps you could keep an eye on it. Viajero -- I'll take care of these. Minesweeper -- The basis of the truce was that I agreed to refrain from adding more, as long as you stopped deleting. The VfD process means nothing to me since it is necessarily biased towards the deletionists. Eclecticology -- If you didn't enjoy deleting articles you wouldn't be doing it. Eclecticology -- Everybody accepts that there are things that need to be deleted, but that is not the way do go about it without irritating people. There are other areas where our mutual co-operation might be more easily forthcoming, notably regarding transfers to Wiktionary. Eclecticology -- I will be content to leave the matter in stasis while Tim does his work. Eclecticology -- You should not get angry at this. Anthère -- I must have missed the end of the discussion/fight over the ambiguous date redirects. Why are 01-01 etc still around? Maximus Rex -- Cheer up Anthère -- It was late at night and I forgot the "move this page" feature existed. Thanks for keeping me honest. Rossami -- I am reassured. Trontonian -- I'm not getting Wikinoid, honest. Luckily I have work to do, so I won't be wasting your time any more for a few hours. Trontonian -- Keep cool, scream in the sand box&#160;! Anthère -- I too must apologize if any of my comments seemed personally offensive. To solve this I would propose a Transwiki: namespace on all projects. Any thoughts on this? Eclecticology -- I was being lesss bold than usual and trying to avoid upsetting Magnus Manske. Jamesday -- If you feel more than slightly keen on deleting it, let me know and I'll file it for use in another case. Jamesday -- Intel 4004 got a lot of attention, as intended and expected, and got better and more informative than it was at the outset. Wernher -- I think he will make me mad. Don't you sometimes have that feeling you are just loosing your time for irrelevant things? Anthère -- The Vandal link on your user page is dead. Noldoaran -- Why were you accused of being a vandal? You don't seem like the type. Noldoaran -- Thank you so much for your patience! You rock! Noldoaran -- I hope it was not my editing style that left you thinking that I needed all the links! Sverdrup -- Cunc didn't do that, but I'm not going to make a fuss. Someone's bound to be offended by the article sometime, and we'll do it all again. Whee! Cyan -- Uh oh. Deletion policy is out of step with the policy stated on Votes for undeletion. Cyan -- Nice to have a friendly word from someone like you on my first day. Texture -- I dunno, I might reapply for adminship eventually. Evercat -- Someone other than User:GH has squatted on the user name, forcing the anonymous IP formerly known as GH to claim the name AM. Cyan -- have posted my reply at Wikipedia:Conflicts between users. PMelvilleAustin -- I did that on purpose, 'cause, um, I wanted the noobs to bug you, not me. Cyan -- Thanks for implementing the "Angela plan" on the "AKFD". Someone else -- Thanks for your efforts, I do recognize that it's a lot of trouble. Martin refuses to accept the vote as valid. Someone else -- Something is wrong. Kingturtle -- If everybody and their brother can create garbage articles why can't I? RickK -- Could you take a look at Pages needing attention and remove the ones you feel have been fixed? Kingturtle -- What has happened with the Earthworm entry? I am reluctant to get in an edit war. WormRunner -- Ain't life grand? WormRunner -- I used an auto-translator at to make an article about the USA. It's a screwy auto-translation, but its better than nothing. WhisperToMe -- did you think that I was vandalising the England page? 82.133.114.121 -- It's really helpful that you clean up after VfD and elsewhere as diligently as you do. Just wanna say thanks on behalf of Wikipedia for your recognizable effort. I can't imagine not having a person with your exceptional organizational skill here. Menchi -- Thanks for deleting sub-pages. Peter Manchester -- Thanks for my graphic. Renato Caniatti -- Vloeimans is more famous than an average college professor. 146.50.173.228 -- Do you think wikipedia:informative will be satisfactory to the deletionist tendency, perhaps edited for seriousness? Martin – Someone misjudged the keep in Wikipedia majority for the lists of postal codes and deleted them. Jamesday -- I was wondering if we could rename Trillium to something like Sagittaria so it would not be confusing to anyone again. WormRunner -- The Polish comrades produced the text of the Protest. I don't know where they got it from. Adam -- The first version of the English translation was done probably by GH. szopen -- Can I apply for sysop rights at Project Sourceberg? Samuel -- I deleted it without actually comparing it. snoyes -- wikipedia'll have to decide whether it wants the ability to delete specific edits from the article history or whether the copyvio in the history is acceptable. snoyes -- I hadn't stumbled upon it yet. snoyes -- The fiction that you were blocking solely to maintain the peace is not tenable. You were in fact participating in the edit war. Eclecticology -- how do I keep the copyright police off my back? KellyCoinGuy -- Thanks for pointing that out. (And so nicely illustrated with colours and all&#160;;-)) snoyes -- I am dissapointed that AKFD has been deleted, and I would certainly have voted against it having been. JackLynch -- please don't misinterpret me as suspecting you as the archtype of whatever opposition there might be to what I've been saying. Why is the search not working tonight? That kinda sucks. JackLynch -- sure does, thanks Angela. JackLynch --What is the proper way for Wikipedia to credit the original source of an article? Joelwest -- Martin Luther is almost verbatim ripped off from a copyright source. Joelwest -- I am not convinced by Camembert's claim that there's no plagiarism). Joelwest -- I'm afraid I accidentally reverted Mother Teresa before I realised it had been protected. FearÉIREANN --Again, Angela, sincere apologies on the protected reversion. I just think a better solution would have been to go back to the point before the edit war. FearÉIREANN -- Thanks from ManicGypsy, lee, Hdk, Paul Darby, LDan, Stevertigo, KRS, Rvalles, Wenteng, Jose Ramos, hoshie, Anthère, Thoth, hoshie, Gryon, Cyan, Chris K, Guppy, Michael Reiter, Alter Ego, noeckel, Stan, Rick Davis, Madelinefelkins, Drernie, RickK, Joey, DJ Clayworth, Pakaran, Alun Ephraim, Arwel, AaronSw, Papotine, Evil saltine, Best Friend, BVC2000, Daniel Quinlan, JessPKC and WormRunner, Jmabel, Alexandros, jo, snoyes, Bmills, Jdstroy.</small></small></p>
