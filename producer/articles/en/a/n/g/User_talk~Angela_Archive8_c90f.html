<p>Hi Angela,</p>
<p>after much deliberation, Martin and I have agreed on <a href="../../../i/n/c/Wikipedia_talk%7EInclusion_dispute_5ef0.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Inclusion dispute">Wikipedia talk:Inclusion dispute</a> that these dispute headers aren't really such a good idea -- we should refine the deletion process instead. I'll work on the two-stage model I proposed in the next few days, in the meantime, please don't add / re-add any of these headers.<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">—Eloquence</a> 03:56, Feb 17, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>There's a new class of users who can turn other users into sysops. This could previously only be done by developers (such as myself). These users are called "bureaucrats". I've picked a few users from <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators_37b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators">Wikipedia:Administrators</a> who I think would make good bureaucrats, and you're one of them. Please don't take that as an insult.&#160;;-)</p>
<p>Do you want to be a bureaucrat? If you say yes, I expect you to keep an eye on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_385d.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship">Wikipedia:Requests for adminship</a> and turn users into sysops in accordance with community consensus.<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">—Eloquence</a> 04:23, Feb 17, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello. While going through zero-byte images to clear them out, I noticed that one of your images is zero bytes, presumably through some sort of upload problem: <a href="../../../i/s/a/Image%7EIsaac.jpg_fae9.html" title="Image:Isaac.jpg">Image:Isaac.jpg</a>. I haven't deleted it, since it's got copyright information on the page I didn't want to lose if you happened to still have it around to re-upload. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 11:11, Feb 17, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Angela, this is ludely. I'm from Argentina. I didn't copy in my article any material from these pages:</p>

<p>I've been working very hard during the whole day to complete the Argentinian page for my University Research project. Please, consider revisiting the decision of removing my modifications to the article because it is very important for me.</p>

<p>Hi Angela -</p>
<p>I'd appreciate it if you could stop by <a href="../../../d/r/u/Talk%7EDrug_addiction_ba44.html" title="Talk:Drug addiction">Talk:Drug addiction</a> and do a quick read of the conversation (if that description applies) between Anthony DiPierro and myself. The <a href="../../../a/d/d/Addiction.html" title="Addiction">addiction</a> page contains no reference to drug addictions at all now except for a link to <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drug_addiction.html" title="Drug addiction">drug addiction</a>, and a valuable external link is gone. I hope you can appreciate my dismay. I'd like your perspective as a neutral party - if I'm out of line, I certainly want to know.</p>
<p>I have no wish to take on a revert war. It is not good for the blood pressure, it is not fair to other sysops, and it is a thorough waste of time when I could be working on other articles. I'm here to learn, to teach, to have fun - not to play childish games.</p>
<p>Thanks for letting me vent.</p>

<p>I've been archiving my talk, not blanking it. I archive it as soon as I read it generally. I had previously planned to leave it until I reached 101 sections, and then archive, but lir said that was bad, so I have been archiving early and often so as not to impair the wikipedias bandwidth (as he said I was doing). The only thing I ever deleted (to my reccollection) from my talk (rather than archiving) was something I found to be semi-dangerous to me (an unfriendly reference to my name by cimon avaro).

<p>Regarding the citation you attached to the barnstar you gave Mav, I strongly object to your unqualified celebration of him as a "role model." Not that this will surprise you to read, but I think he's been a particularly bad role model with regard to enforcement of Wikipedia policies and with regard to NPOV representations of the behavior of individuals for public discussion. I should know. I don't doubt that he is an excellent role model in many respects, but not in the ones I mentioned, which are timely and very prominent at least in my mind right now. If you think this thing between me and Mav has been a big deal and reflected poorly on Mav or if you think it made him feel less appreciated than he truly is, then I can understand why you would want to remind him and the community of the good he has done with the award and the citation. But with just a little different wording, you could have done this in a way that wouldn't appear to deny that he had committed (whether accidentally or not) an injustice against me and fostered an imbrologio (i.e. if I had not been pilloried by Mav, other admins probably wouldn't be reverting me without discussion, and my wars with admins probably never wouldn't have happened). I suspect people haven't come to a conclusion yet about me and what happened, and to the extent they perceive there was nothing wrong in how Mav behaved, they are liable to perceive me as wicked and completely in the wrong. I don't want that. Yes, I'm sensitive about my reputation right now. I suspect you would be too. <a href="../../../1/6/8/User%7E168....html" title="User:168...">168...</a>|<a href="../../../1/6/8/User_talk%7E168....html" title="User talk:168...">...Talk</a> 19:09, 19 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for getting back, Angela. I can only speak from my perspective. If <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_DiPierro_ebfd.html" title="User:Anthony DiPierro">M. DiPierro</a> insists that there be a separate well-written and comprehensive article on <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drug_addiction.html" title="Drug addiction">drug addiction</a>, then let's make sure it is. I therefore took the time to add some value to the article, to the extent that including it as a section in <a href="../../../a/d/d/Addiction.html" title="Addiction">addiction</a> would have unbalanced that article and required it to be rewritten. I am satisfied that the drug addiction article now has some value beyond repeating what was on the addiction page. Not having heard from AP, I cannnot say if he wishes to continue the dispute or not. If he does, he will have to find a mirror to do so.</p>
<p>Thanks also for your offer of help - you just did. I've been wondering how to create archive pages, and wanting to set up a clipping section. I went to your <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_useful_stuff_0077.html" title="User:Angela/useful stuff">useful stuff</a> section - search over.</p>
<p>Just one question: in reading through one of the special pages, I noted a user who had found himself in trouble for, it appeared, changing/deleting information on his own userpage. Did I misinterpret, or are there really guidlines (beyond the obvious) for userpages?</p>

<dd>Because I know you'll catch some flak for it, I wanted to let you know that I do understand where you were coming from. Lir has a lot of potential and is getting much better (in what I've seen) overall, and I can understand the desire to want to encourage him by offering him the status he wants. I think your reconsideration that the timing still isn't right is wise, but I also agree that all of us would be wise to look at what Lir is doing, not what he's done. Sadly it seems that not all of what he's doing is productive enough to avoid censure from some, but perhaps it will change with time if we let him. <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 22:40, 20 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your comments 168, and James. Maybe it's just because I haven't personally clashed with Lir that I feel differently to most. I realise he gets in a lot of edit wars, but in my mind that seems somewhat disconnected from sysop powers, which I do trust him not to abuse. It was a silly nomination though. I should have realised that being made a sysop isn't really about being trusted anyway, even though it should be. But nominating Lir was not a good judgement call. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 22:55, Feb 20, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Angela, maybe you can help me out. I really can't understand how I'm supposed to proceed if I have an accuracy dispute with what is in an article, but no one to engage with. Please see item "Uqbar, and accuracy disputes" on the Village Pump, it leads to the article and talk page in question.

<dd>I'm sure I could simply write the article that "Uqbar" should have, so I gather that rather than marking it as needing attention, I should go ahead and write it? What's basically happened so far is that someone (either intentionally or not) has taken a fictional place and written about it as if it is real.

<p>Dear Angela, how are things? Im not around at the time but i stopped in a internet cafe to check things and i had an idea. In the Featuerd article page talk (sorry this damn keyboard doesnt have the rectangular parentesis) it has been suggested a new face to the page. We only have a suggestion that looks a lot like the Main Page. So i was thnking that, since you have such a nice user page, maybe i can convince you to design something. What do you say, very busy?

If I were on Wikipedia I sense that he and I would be reverting each other 24 hours a day.&#160;:-) One good thing came out of this thing, it looks like Eloquence wrote a Wikinfo import script and imported some articles the other direction for a change.

<p>It seems that the tendency is for folks to type Infosecpedia rather than InfoSecPedia, so I was planning to move the page.

<p>Hi Angela, I was just looking at your suggestion for the design of the thumbnail boarders. You say the "border is only down one side, which holds the image, caption and magnifying glass together, without the need to border the entire picture" but to me it looks similar to James F.'s one - i.e. it has a border round the image, caption and icon.

<p>You said <i>(right, well I quit anyway due to the idiotic claims that the AMA supports unilateralism, so no need to oppose my position here Perl)</i> You may wish to note the authorship of said claims, and their lack of support amongst actual member advocates. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 22:03, 1 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think that most of your comments about the AMA are really very good Angela but I wanted to ask you about your statement: ""Alex claims we are here to criticise the Arbitration Committee". Can you tell me on what basis you have that opinion about my "claims"? I do not think "criticizing" anything was a primary goal of the association. Certainly if the arbitration committee does something arbitrary it should be criticized and if a group of people can agree on the inappropriateness of their behavior that would help to improve that committee's future behavior (that is part of what advocacy is all about). However, I do not think that I ever said that that "Critiise the Arbitration committee" was why "we are here". Advocacy is, as you say, something that cannot be forced on people and it should not be organized in overly legalistic ways (though I do think that there have to be standards by which advocates operate). If you leave as "a member" I hope you will at least continue to participate (such as I have decided to do). I think you are right about trolls and there is a tendency for such groups to become like "clubs" but when I started it I thought that there was a hope that it could be a way for a group of like minded people to work towards common goals and help fellow Wikipedians. I feel when I say something people may be reading too much into it and are not talking to me about what I really mean because it appears to I have said. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex756_a868.html" title="User:Alex756">— Alex756 [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Alex756 talk]</a> 15:58, 2 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your comments. Being an advocate can mean to advocate for groups of people, not just individuals; in that way one can be advocating in a more public forum that might include mediation or arbitration. As far as becoming <a href="../../../l/o/b/Lobbyist.html" title="Lobbyist">lobbyists</a> I don't think that is really part of being an advocate's job here at Wikipedia; though what lobbyists do might be considered a kind of advocacy, it was not really a part of what I had in mind.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding the idea of keeping Wikipedia's rules fair and responsive was a reference to Wikipedia's rules regarding the Arbitration and Mediation Committees (I thought this was obvious) because, as you say — and I agree with you completely — the main goal of the association was (and hopefully is) to help people who are faced with the rules of these committees and the dispute resolution process (i.e. you may be advocating for a particular person or you may also be advocating the way some rule make it hard for the person to be treated fairly in an effort to get the rule changed or modified for that person as well as others who will follow them in the future). Obviously (and once again maybe only to me), I don't think that the AMA should be dealing with questions of naming conventions or other content-based Wikipedia rules, but rules dealing with member interactions and disputes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The primary goal of the AMA in my original conception of the "Office of Members' Advocates" was to be a resource center (hence the use of the word office in the name) that could help other Wikipedians faced with internecine disputes regarding volunteer behaviours. IT was <i>not</i> to become some kind of lobbying or politically motiviated organization with an agenda. Feel free to quote me on that. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex756_a868.html" title="User:Alex756">— Alex756 [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Alex756 talk]</a></dd>

<p>I agree with Alex that the AMA should not promote lobbying or a particular agenda.

It shouldn't be taken as an AMA viewpoint, and has been moved to the talk page. Generally, people have been treating the AMA page as a forum recently instead of using the talk page. I regret this problem, and would certainly welcome you back to the AMA if you wish to participate. The concept of the association is still relatively new, but its nature may make it a target for trolling behavior. In that case, any help in maintaining internal controls of the association itself would be appreciated. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 19:10, 2 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Can we have this article unprotected? There are 3 solid issues with the current version (Let better Szopen voice them):</p>
<p>Now, i see the article is protected. What are the issues with it?</p>
<p>Let's sort them out 1) Whether one should add emotional sentences like "despite all odds" into encyclopedia article 2) Whether Polish-German treaty guaranteed rights of both minorities (Polish in Germany and German in Poland) or only German in Poland (this is easier to check and verify) 3) Whether it is needed to add the "15 million" number when it is number of Germans expelled or who escaped from ALL eastern Europe in article treating on Poland alone. <a href="../../../s/z/o/User%7ESzopen_9055.html" title="User:Szopen">Szopen</a></p>

<p>There are extenuating circumstances. VfD is 110kb! Angela. 14:06, Mar 6, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, you're right. At the time though the move was not made (IMO) for size purposes. The move was made for "political" (deletionist vs. inclusionist) reasons. And it led to a revert war on vfd. I was trying to find a compromise that would keep edit wars off vfd. I made the edit comment the way I did because I didn't want to make tempers any hotter. Between me doing that and Texture deciding to be a good guy and not insist on his own way, it seems to have worked. The edit war stopped when I moved the discussion back. <a href="../../../m/o/i/User%7EMoink_dc9f.html" title="User:Moink">moink</a> 17:19, 6 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Forgive me for barging in on this conversation. It may not appear that way but anytime I see a two person exchange that runs six layers below the vote it is clearly not part of the VfD process. I tried to move our exchange to the talk page to keep it from continuing down the VfD page. Anthony didn't like it and twice I tried to find a different move to calm Anthony while keeping the exchange off the VfD. Nothing worked so I had no problem leaving it on the talk page or on VfD.

<dd>Ok, I think there has been some confusion here. I know nothing about any edit war. I just noticed that after I decided to move that stuff from VfD that moink had already once reverted that happening with the edit summary "vfd discussion belongs on vfd except in extenuating circumstances", so I thought I had better explain what the extenuating circumstances were that led to me moving it. It wan't in any way supposed to reflect support or otherwise for any previous move of the discussion. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 11:56, Mar 7, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The problem is that what you want is a browser glitch. I'm not sure what is the standrad in these kind of cases, but each browser handles them to its own. Let me see if I can explain it. =/</p>
<p>When you assign a width of 10px to the object/anchor, but the object is bigger than that size, the browser has to decide how does it render it:</p>
<ul>
<li>hide all content that is outside the boundaries of the width (ie: only render what is seen in those 10px)</li>
<li>ignore the width attribute (what MSIE does, and what should be done)</li>
<li>render the object with the attributes given but show the content outside of its boundaries (what Mozilla does, and what it shouldn't do -- the glitch)</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, AFAIK it can't be done.&#160;:( I will fix it later, have a compromise today, sorry.</p>

<dd>Thanks for note about weird image problem. I see that the 2nd, incorrect *description* page has been deleted and I guess it really is just somehow incorreclty displaying the same image in 2 places.

<p>Hi, Angela! Thanks for your attention to Ko-Wiki. I want to know precisely how I could improve the structure of the Korean-Wiki (above all the mainmenu on the left-side which seems pretty sorry in the Ko-Wiki, because translations from en. into ko. need to correct to better understand and some of them is yet in english).

<p>Dear Angela, oracle, true pythoness of the Wikipedia. Here i am to pest you with another question. Dearest Mr DiPierro pointed me, with his <i>lovely</i> manners, that we should delete copyvios from page histories, even if it means delete the page to recreate it again with a stub, or the original non copyrighted text. Ok, that is what is said in the header of copyright infringements page, but do we do this? And if so why? What is the point of deleting a page history just to remove proof of the copyvio?

<p>Thank you, Angela, for your comments and suggestions, you seem to be a reasonable and moderate person. I have already tried most the methods you advise and they seem to work with most of editors. But they DON'T work with Nico. He just have fun in reverting, destroying, entering into edit wars and insulting people. The problem is Nico makes no improvement into the articles, he only makes sure the German names of Polish cities are mentioned EVERYWHERE, he also makes sure the German names are mentioned in FIRST PLACE, he also erases alternative names in other non-German languages (Pomeranian/Kashubian, Silesian), he erases city lists, erases maps, erases 'Polish' features and defends 'German' features of the articles.. Nico also claims that most of Poland should be called Eastern Germany. That's why I have no doubt in calling him a Neo-Nazi poison mind. <a href="../../../g/d/a/User%7EGdansk_3407.html" title="User:Gdansk">Mestwin of Gdansk</a> 22:09, 14 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I just don't know what to do with Nico, he is destroying valuable work of other editors giving no improvement to the Wikiepdia content. His extremist activities are also chasing away moderate editors who could join the Wikipedia community. There is much enthusiasm among the new editors, but in the longer run the community must have some sort of anti-extremist policy. If Nico stays here and moderate editors go away, the extremist will win. I am of Polish origin I have (or had) many German friends. Because of Nico's insulting activities this changed radically my thinking about Germany and the Germans. Before I had freinds, now I have enemies. Because of Nico I started to boycott German products in my shopping, and when I see the German tourists in Poland I have a feeling that I want to smash they faces (not doing this of course). I have always considered myself a moderate but Nico's extremism is changing slowly my thinking into an Anti-Nico extremism. And this is exactly why I think we should get rid of Nico. For Wikipedia. For the community good. I hope it will work. <a href="../../../g/d/a/User%7EGdansk_3407.html" title="User:Gdansk">Mestwin of Gdansk</a> 22:20, 14 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>(Angela, I take the liberty to answer right here.) Mestwin, let me tell you that I'm sorry to read the above, let me also tell you that there is NO need for you to think that you have enemies instead of friends. I have been to Poland a number of times, and was always welcomed there, as I have worked together with Poles in Germany quite satisfactory. Half of my family lived in Breslau (yes I know what it is rightfully called today), and I think that it is high time to work together. If you read the "Eastern Germany" talk page, you will see for yourself, that there are quite a lot of "moderate" people around, and I trust that, with a little patience, the moderate view will eventually win the case. --<a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalapala_26b2.html" title="User:Palapala">Palapala</a> 22:48, 2004 Mar 14 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Angela,</p>
<p>I've amended the proposal on 24 hour bans for edit wars. In short, the amendment calls for a <a href="../../../q/u/i/Wikipedia%7EQuickpoll_1549.html" title="Wikipedia:Quickpoll">quickpoll</a> to take place before any such ban can be implemented.

<p>Angela, I hope you weren't too upset by my quiet presence. As might be read between the lines at <a href="../../../r/u/h/User%7ERuhrjung_40b8.html" title="User:Ruhrjung">User:ruhrjung</a>, I'm cautious (bordering to sceptic) with regard to wikipedia's chances to evade different kinds of perrils. As I see it, I made a study tour of the <s>arbitration committee</s> (ooops!) mediation process this night. My honest impression is that you lived up to the expectations one reasonably could have on you.<br />

<p>Hello, Angela. Thanks for your message back in January:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>You could certainly argue that people should use {{subst..}} rather than {{msg...}}. There has already been some dispute over this, so I expect you could push for the use of subst more than msg if you want. That way they do not appear as "meaningless-looking codes" after the article is saved. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 07:41, Jan 20, 2004 (UTC)</i></dd>

<p>And sorry I've taken so long to reply. I thought I could live with them, but finally a few days ago I exploded, and wrote an argument ("msg considered harmful") at <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia_talk%7EMediaWiki_namespace_d25f.html" title="Wikipedia talk:MediaWiki namespace">Wikipedia talk:MediaWiki namespace</a> which basically asked for "msg" not to be used.

<p>Yes, the bit about claiming consensus was just my silly idea of "humour".&#160;:) I'd like to reopen the debate, though. I've decided to test the somewhat idealistic view that the <i>status quo</i> can be changed if the arguments against it are strong enough, no matter how firmly entrenched it might be. Should I be advertising my debate on other pages, do you think? -- <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOliver_Pereira_ccc2.html" title="User:Oliver Pereira">Oliver P.</a> 02:07, 16 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, Angela! Recently I've tried to revise the All_Messages on ko-wiki. It seems to me a heavy work to find right transl. from en into ko.

<p>Hello Angela, sorry to contact you through the <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">Talk page</a>. I've had a tiny little edit war with <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrusadeonilliteracy_6eb4.html" title="User:Crusadeonilliteracy">User:Crusadeonilliteracy</a> on the correct spelling of <a href="../../../h/a/e/Haemochromatosis.html" title="Haemochromatosis">Haemochromatosis</a>. I know that us Europeans prefer the "ae"-spelling, but AFAIK Wikipedia uses American English and mentions the UK version only in the detail. I was wondering if you would support (and perform??) the move of <a href="../../../h/a/e/Haemochromatosis.html" title="Haemochromatosis">Haemochromatosis</a> to a current redirect page <a href="../../../h/e/m/Hemochromatosis.html" title="Hemochromatosis">Hemochromatosis</a>, as IMHO this is the correct spelling. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">Jfdwolff</a> 15:53, 22 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your comments on my <a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff">talk page</a>. Will there be any further guidelines on spelling (US/UK)?

It was a substantive revision, but I forgot to leave a summary and to uncheck the "minor edit" box. If you have the ability, perhaps you would like to remove the status of that revision from "minor". Future users who examine the page history might appreciate it.</p>
<p>Also, you might like to edit the summary of the revision made on 02:15, 2004 Mar 23; part of that summary is merely a notice to the mistake in the previous revision's summary.</p>

<p>For the record, the comment I remembered was "Personally, I'm not sure the supposed removal of legitimate information is always a bad thing. Not every legitimate fact, and certainly not every idiosyncratic opinion, needs to be included. It's an encyclopedia article, not a comprehensive collection of all the information that ever existed on Mother Teresa, or any other topic". In the context, I interpreted that as a defense of the repeatedly attempted removal of criticisms of Mother Teresa from the article. Furthermore, you stated that you believed that I would accuse you of being a "rabid MT apologist" if you intervened in the discussion, which is and was extremely unlikely, and which I considered to be clearly taking sides on who is being the aggressor in the dispute.<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">—Eloquence</a> 02:46, Mar 28, 2004 (UTC)</p>
