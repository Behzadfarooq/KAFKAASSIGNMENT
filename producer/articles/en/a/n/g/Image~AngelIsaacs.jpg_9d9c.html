<p>Angel Isaacs is widely recognized as the first independent National level Contemporary Christian Music recording artist and songwriter. She is the leading theologically educated Christian songwriter and recording artist. She received her BA in Mass Communication Radio/TV from Abilene Christian University (Abilene, Texas 1984). She was the 14th woman to ever receive a Master of Arts in Religion from David Lipscomb University (Nashville, 1997). She is the 3rd woman to ever receive a Master of Divinity from Lipscomb University (Nashville, 2006). As the first independent National level ccm artist and songwriter Angel was personally mentored by Dwight Liles, winner of 7 Dove Awards from the Gospel Music Association. She is currently enrolled in the University of Central Florida Non-Profit Management Master's degree and is studying Grant Writing and Fundraising to help the less fortunate.</p>
<p>Angel was born in Abilene, Texas into the Church of Christ, and into a tradition of accapella music (the Ch. of Christ is one of a few churches who do not believe in using instrumental music in worship). As a result she developed beautiful harmonies with her voice. Her respect for her background prompted her to remain an independent artist in the early years of Contemporary Christian Music while other artists of her caliber were signed by major labels. Angel forsook the fame and fortune and went her own independent way, writing songs from her heart and playing to small crowds at coffeehouses. Her Church of Christ heritage also led her to have the utmost respect for the Bible, for they patterned themselves after the original New Testament church and believed the holy scriptures were inspired by God.</p>
<p>Angel's father worked at Teledyne during the Apollo years of moon travel. Her father brought crates home one day and had his family, (Angel was 12) place their hands and fingertips on them. He knew these particular crates had been scheduled to be left behind on the moon and he wanted his family's fingerprints to be on the moon. He later formed his own electronics manufacturing corporation and plant and Angel's family has spent 30 years involved with the creation and manufacturing of electronics products, in Austin, Texas.</p>
<p>Angel married Robin Isaacs, who was twenty years older, and they raised a family. Robin was the first person in world history to use a computer to monitor the drilling of an oil well. He worked for Dresser Industries in the early days of computer pc's and was on the beta testing researcher's list for the first Intel computer chip. He had built a computer for the chip to go into and the second he received the chip from Intel he took the computer out to the oil field and hooked it up with sensors to a drilling oil well. After this he continued his work at Dresser, an oil-service Fortune 100 company in Houston, Texas, for another twenty years. He was known throughout the oil industry as the technology genius in using computers to monitor the drilling of oil wells. He developed a system used by Superior Oil in Lafayette, Louisiana (Mobil bought Superior), that was documented through a now famous Society of Petroleum Engineers paper as saving Mobil $24 million dollars per year, in 1983, through drilling optimization. A blowout on one well that ignored Robin's computer warning was well documented as costing Mobil $240 million dollars. Wells that were in the process of drilling were all monitored in real-time (the second they were drilled, say in Africa or the North Sea, or Oklahoma, the data showed up on Robin's computers through microwave and satellite links) and his system monitored dozens of wells located anywhere in the world, all at once. Robin's private opinion was that his system saved Mobil at least $100 million annually, for over a decade in drilling costs and in drilling optimization. He had retained the contractual rights to market his system to other oil companies and had developed his ideas in a period of history where the intellectual property laws gave ownership rights to the creator, regardless of employment. His goal was to set up his system world-wide and then use the income to allow him to research artificial intelligence and eventually mass transport (Yes, like in Star Trek, "Beam me up, Scotty!"). Robin's IQ placed him in the top 1000 humans who had ever lived, the top 1/10th of 1% of the most intelligent people ever on earth.</p>
<p>Angel and Robin purchased an estate from Vanderbilt University in Tennessee that had been in the family of Senator Edgar Evins and Congressman Joe L. Evins for fifty years before they gave it to Vanderbilt. This estate was an hour from Nashville in Smithville, Tennessee and consisted of 40 acres of prime forest, a canyon-like gorge with three incredible waterfalls, 2 million gallons of water per day, 6 stories and 15 stories high, a stream, a Mill pond and 20,000 sq. feet of ancient pioneer buildings. These buildings included a 7500 sq. foot, 4 story Grist Mill, a 5 story Granary to store corn and wheat for the Mill, a Chapel, a Guesthouse, and a log and stone mansion known as the Lodge, hidden in the trees at the top of a cliff overlooking the Mill pond and Mill buildings. Angel, Robin and the children moved from Houston to Middle Tennessee and Angel named their estate, "Chapelgate."</p>
<p>Over the next several years Robin worked on his technology, known as the "Drilling Data Center" with his customer Mobil Oil in Dallas, over the phone computer links from Chapelgate. Together, the family restored the ancient buildings spending 9,000 hours replacing broken windows, building staircases, painting, mowing, etc. etc. etc. until Chapelgate sparkled like a paradise. Angel had been writing Contemporary Christian Music songs since a year before they moved to Chapelgate when she won a Christian artist Songwriting contest held by KSBJ in Houston, judged by Morgan Cryer and recorded at Rivendale Studios by Kemper Crabb's engineers, "Heaven" - the second song she had ever written. Her prize was a trip to the Gospel Music Association's annual Christian artist retreat at Estes Park, Colorado. However, this was the summer they purchased Chapelgate and Angel chose to move with her family to Tennessee that summer instead. Soon, however she began driving into Nashville to attend the Fellowship of Contemporary Christian music recording artists bi-weekly meetings at Koinonia, at Belmont Church where Amy Grant attended. Angel met hundreds of Christian recording artists during this period of her life. She and her family decided to turn Chapelgate into a private hideaway for Gospel and Contemporary Christian Songwriters and Recording Artists. They built two stages in the Mill area, one outside and one inside the Grist Mill and held concerts and retreats. Many National Christian recording artists visited Chapelgate and many, including Independents, performed on Angel's stages.</p>
<p>The Isaac's family built a recording studio in the Lodge mansion using a $10,000. Akai 1212, the first home recording system. At the time they used the first Compaq ($7500) and the first Apple Macintosh ($7500) and the first Apple LaserWriter printer ($7500) and set the system up to use Robin's grand piano in the huge split level 1500 sq. foot living room (picture log walls, and a great fireplace at each end of the room). Angel and Robin had met Dwight Liles, one of the top National level Christian Songwriters in the 1980's through the Nashville meetings. Dwight worked for StarSong (and his best friend Niles Borup worked for Word) as staff Songwriters. Dwight had written "Living Sacrifice" for Chris Christian, had worked with Petra, Scott Wesley Brown, Dave Mullins, Sandi Patti, Keith Green, and dozens of other major artists winning 7 Dove Awards from the Gospel Music Association. Dwight produced Angel's first two albums with Robin as the engineer in the Chapelgate mansion. Angel's songs were played by radio stations across the country and she made television appearances, yet she still remained persistent in her desire to be an Independent artist and not work for a major label. She believed she could write from her heart and express her ideas about God better if she remained Independent. She wanted to simply live her faith and then write songs about what God taught her. She didn't think she'd be able to do this if she was signed to a major label, so she remained an Independent. Amy Grant and Gary Chapman, of Atlantic records came out to Chapelgate with Mike Blanton, Polaris films, and a crew and filmed Amy's "Lead Me On" video at Angel's incredible waterfalls. Amy Grant's "Lead Me On" video won the Gospel Music Dove Award for best video that year, 1989, and over the years became the No. 1 Christian Music video of all time.</p>
<p>On Christmas Eve of the next year, 1990, Robin Isaacs, while putting up their Christmas tree which he and their oldest son had cut from the forest, had an unexpected and sudden heart attack and died next to the Christmas tree. God performed the first miracle of this tragedy. Angel's family, her mother, father, brother and his family, and her sister and her family, had been driving from Texas to Tennessee for Christmas at Chapelgate for the past two days. They had been slowed by a snowstorm in Arkansas and were late. God timed their arrival on the doorstep of the Chapelgate Lodge mansion within 15 minutes of Angel and the children's discovery of Robin's death, arriving moments before the ambulance. At this point in time Angel's life shifted.</p>
<p>Over the next year one tragedy after another dominoed. Angel lost the business she had co-founded with Robin, one item at a time she lost all of her possessions, the grand piano, the diamonds, the Corvette, all the furniture, all the savings, and finally she lost Chapelgate. She had tried desperately to hold on and had trusted God to help her with Robin's software and technology but the answer seemed to be "No," because Mobil refused to cooperate with her and cut off her royalties and income. Angel had made a vow, however, the year before they had bought Chapelgate to love and walk with God and she kept doing this, even as bad things were happening to her.</p>
<p>The next five years, after losing Chapelgate, Angel moved her little family into a small apartment in Nashville, then home to her parents in Texas. She spoke with several intellectual property attorneys about the situation and they filed a lawsuit in Federal Court against Dresser Industries and Mobil Oil over the lost profits and ownership rights of the Data Center for $690 Million dollars. Angel walked with angel's among wolves during this period and watched helplessly as 20 of the world's best lawyers stole Robin's life work. The Federal judge, in a jury trial, dismissed the jury and decided that Angel owned the technology and software to Robin's system but Mobil and Dresser didn't have to pay a penny and Mobil could use the system royalty-free worldwide, as well as sell its services to all other oil companies. Robin's system eventually became absorbed into the Exxon-Mobil oil drilling technology and his concepts are still used by every oil company in the industry. When Angel tells the story, though, it has a different viewpoint. Before the judge made his decision she had quietly gone into the courthouse bathroom, knelt down on the floor in a locked stall, and prayed, "Dear Father, this trial is for almost a billion dollars, ...a billion dollars. Father, you know, it's pretty astounding, but this doesn't even have the power to tempt me away from you. I love you more. All I want is to go where you lead me. If you want to, you can take the billion dollars, Lord. If there is someway that you can use this situation for your glory then I give it to you. You can take every penny...yes, even if it means my hope of ever getting Chapelgate back, and, Father, you know how much I love Chapelgate." And that is exactly what happened. They took every penny and left her destitute, stripped clean, in their malice. Mobil and Dresser had each spent over a million dollars in attorney fees just to make sure Angel had nothing and Robin's Data Center, his lifework and his wife and children's security and inheritance, was their prize. When the trial was over Angel went outside into the hall and sat down, stunned, yet ok. In a few minutes she looked up and there, about 50 feet away, was a circle of all the powerful oil men and attorneys and they were laughing and slapping each other on the back in jubilation at the outcome of the case. Angel quietly prayed, "What do you want me to do, Father? Then she tried to think about what Jesus would do. She got up softly and went over to them. She held out her hand to the main attorney, while everyone was deathly silent, and said, "I want you to know that my Father made this decision here today, not you, my Father has chosen to allow you to kill me, (because they had taken everything she and her children had in the world, including all her income, Robin's Data Center, Chapelgate and every possession and hope for the future) ...somehow it is for his glory. I want you to know that and that I forgive you." Then she sweetly left a stunned group of men behind her, walked away, and went to her car outside in the courthouse parking lot. She always listened to Contemporary Christian Music on her car radio and when she got in the car and turned the ignition the radio came on loud and strong. "Well done, my good and faithful servant, well done," was the line of the song that filled the car around her, "Enter in to all the riches of the kingdom of heaven." Angel considers that to also be a miracle.</p>
<p>This began a decade of poverty for Angel and the children. At the same time Angel enrolled at Lipscomb University and worked on her first Master's degree in Religion while home schooling the children. She wanted to try to understand God better and to understand scripture, God's Word, better. Angel continued to love and follow God and to write her beautiful songs and she feels like God took special care of her and her family during their poverty. Angel's spiritual insight into God and the Bible, God's Word was sharpened and formed through not just the high places of the world but the low. Angel remained an Independent artist and performed at coffeehouses and small venues. She wrote over 150 Christian songs through the years of prosperity at Chapelgate and through the years of poverty. Her lyrics are based on her walk with God through blessing and tragedy and are some of the most beautiful songs with the deepest ideas and insight into God and the Bible, God's Word, that have ever been written. In her studies Angel gravitated, because of her Church of Christ heritage and their love for the Bible, towards the ancient languages of the Hebrew and Greek manuscripts the Bible was written in originally. After she graduated in 1997 with her first Master's degree in Religion she moved her little family to Orlando, Florida to finish raising them in the sunshine near the ocean. Her son, Sidney was home schooled and accepted at ACU (and graduated with a degree in computer science) after only completing the 9th grade, her son Tristan is in the Air Force serving his country in Iraq, her beautiful daughter, Cara is attending college, and Angel's straight from heaven youngest daughter, Skye, was raised mostly in Orlando. During this period in Orlando Angel spent over six years and over 10,000 hours studying the ancient Hebrew and Greek of the Bible scriptures. Because God had led her through both blessing and tragedy she read through a heart full of deep insight. She began writing her songs based on the ideas she studied in these ancient teachings of Christianity blended with the current theological ideas in her Master of Divinity program. All of Angel's songs are about what God is actually like and about what he has to say to us in his Word and in the world around us.</p>
<p>Today, Angel's songs are simply amazing in their beauty and insight. They are all from different points in her walk through light and darkness. They are are sincere, true, and written from places of high blessings and deep pain and loss, blended together. Her love for God pours through her sweet voice and through her incredible lyrics into her songs.</p>
<p>Angel calls her life story "The Chapelgate Adventure Story," and her songs have spread all over the internet, available at CD Baby, Best Buy, Apple itunes, WalMart.com, Rhapsody, and dozens of other music outlets, usually free. Just search for "Angel Isaacs Chapelgate" on Yahoo (or search for Angel Isaacs on CDBaby.com or go to her website ChapelgateAngel.com) and you'll find them.</p>
