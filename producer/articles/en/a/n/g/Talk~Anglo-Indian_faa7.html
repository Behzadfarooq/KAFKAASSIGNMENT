<p>ANGLO INDIANS AND THEIR INDIAN ANCESTORY and IDENTITY: Can anyone explain why Engelbert Humperdinck (the singer) seems to be in denial of the Indian side of his ancestory (an accusation that can be leveled at many other Anglo Indians)? I went to school in Mumbai (St.Mary's High School, Mazagoan)with a Patrick Dorsey who said he was a first cousin of Englebert's. To us he was as Indian as the rest of us. We were all dead proud of Englebert's achievments, thou' we may not necessarily have liked his music (it was music for our Mums and Dads, in an era of the Stones and the Beatles!). However, over the past 30yrs in England I've seen various interviews on telly with Englebert and in all of them he never refers to his Indian past (except in the interview with Mark Lawson) and constantly refers to himself as the Leicester Lad. The reality was that his 'lad' days were spent in the lap of luxury (the horrors of partition apart) in India. He also always talks about coming 'home'. England was his father's home, sure; but India was his mother's and it was the land of his birth. I would therefore argue that that aught to have been his home really.</p>
<p>Many Anglo Indians (a classification unknown to the English back home, incidentally) spoke of coming 'home' but when they got to England were considered 'Pakis' like the rest of us. I know of a fully paid up Anglo Indian, formerly from Cochin, a builder by trade who recently had to flee the Eltham area in S.E. London, known to be a rabid National Front (the right wing fascist party) stronghold, when he responded to call to his ad in the name of C.Dunn. I know he didn't feel at 'home' then!</p>
<p>I'll end by urging all Anglo Indians in doubt of their ancestory to also embrace their 'Indian-ness'. You may have been collaborators in the colonial project but India bears no grudge. All is forgiven!! India is on the ascendant again and if one needs to know some of your Indian ancestors' achievements, apart from giving the world it's numerals and zero here's something you ought to take note and be proud of: Q. We Indians are the wealthiest among all ethnic groups in America, and growing in the rest of the worldâ¦ even faring better than those of European descent, the Jews, Latin Americans and the natives. There are only 2.22 million Indians in the USA (1.5% of population).</p>
<p>YET, 38% of doctors in the USA are Indians. 20% scientists in the USA are Indians. 36% of NASA scientists are Indians. 34% of Microsoft employees are Indians. 28% of IBM employees are Indians. 17% of INTEL scientists are Indians. 13% of XEROX employees are Indians.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that you are both Indian and English/British. That is a reality you can be proud of.</p>
<p>Engelbert Humperdinck and Anglo Indians remember to embrace your Indian side too. Acknowledge your mother!</p>

<p>Cliff Richard is the son of an Anglo-Indian train driver. Are you sure you want to deny that he is Anglo-Indian? And Vivian Leigh might have denied it, Merle Oberon always did, but that does not mean she is not Anglo-Indian. Her mother's name was Yackjee.

<p>1. AIs (yes, they refer to themselves as AIs, not "Anglos") have reserved seats not just for MPs but MLAs as well (State Legislative Assemblies). I was a member of the AIAIA (All India Anglo Indian Association) that made the recommendations for MLAs appointments and I'm fairly sure we did one for AP (Hyderbad).</p>
<p>2. The AI community has made contributions to India that far surpass their numbers. How come none of this is covered? Any takers? They comprised most of the staff in missionary schools (probably 99.99% of people who had an English education in India were taught by an AI at some point). But that pales into insignificance when you look at the contributions they made to the railways, the Navy (particularly during the 1965 and 1971 conflicts), ports, customs, and sport. At one point in time, I understand, 7 of the Indian Hockey team members were AIs.</p>
<p>3. We don't seem to have any mention of their unique foods (ball curry and coconut rice with devil chutney, anyone?), the words and expressions unique to the community, the annual Christmas dances, other socio-cultural matters worthy of comment.</p>
<p>Any takers? <a href="../../../p/o/w/User%7EPoweroid_35e1.html" title="User:Poweroid">Poweroid</a> 20:45, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I added a great deal to the history section, which seemed to be quite empty.</p>
<p>I made two small edits:</p>
<p>The "Portuguese" in British India were described as European immigrants (or European Indians), whereas, in reality, "Portuguese" was an officially sanctioned name for any Anglo-Indian with Hispanic blood.</p>
<p>Also they were described as just having British fathers. This was not always so. The most famous Anglo-Indian poet, Henry Derozio, had an English mother.</p>

<p>1. Removed etymology of AI. The definitions in the opening para are sufficient summaries.</p>
<p>2. "It may also assist you henceforth in penning your lucubrations:....Well, Sir, I think I have submitted sufficient, and really, even upon a third and fourth perusal, I am at a loss to fix upon one...". I'm removing all of this. Please read the POV guidelines.</p>
<p>3. "An infusion of âsuperiorâ British blood would, it was thought, create a caste of Super-Natives..." There is no evidence that the Anglo-Indian community came about from anything other than simple inter-marriages/unions of British and Indians. To suggest the British consciously worked towards creating a community of mixed blood requires some evidence. Are we suggesting that British all over India worked at inter-racial unions with the sole intention of creating Anglo-Indians? I'm removing this.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding the above, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Francis_Burton_67ea.html" title="Richard Francis Burton">Richard Francis Burton</a> wrote that he had never witnessed or heard of a case of an Indian kept woman falling in love with her white protector. He also mentions that these women scornfully compared their English lovers to village roosters for the paucity and brevity of their sexual performances. As for marrying an Indian woman, that would have been considered 'going Native'. Taken altogether, not the soundest foundation for the creation of a 'super' race.

<p>4. " 1901 census of Calcutta....Anglo Indians have always been an integral part of Calcutta's society... first European settlement in Bengal at Hooghly, and set up a famous church at Bandel to bear witness to their Catholic piety...Hooghly waned, the Kintals journeyed to the new city of Calcutta..." What's with all the focus on Calcutta, Bandel, Hooghly? Sure, Cal has it's fair share of AIs - and AI history - but if we included a similar quantity of AI history from other provinces, from the Bombays to the Trichys the article would far exceed Wikipedia max sizes.</p>
<p>I'm reverting to an older copy of the article. That seems easier than making all the modifications above... and others. I've also left previous editor a message on his own talk page.

<dd>As stated in the article, the term AI refers not only to mixed race individuals but also to "persons not temporarily domiciled in India" of purely European descent; and to that extent, Anglo-Indians are self selected. Take for example <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Corbett_0555.html" title="Jim Corbett">Jim Corbett</a>, who strongly identified himself as an Indian and has been honored as such by the Indian Government and people. An interesting parallel to Corbett is <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Leakey_b2c8.html" title="Louis Leakey">Louis Leakey</a>, who clearly implies in his autobiography that he considered himself a <a href="../../../k/i/k/Kikuyu.html" title="Kikuyu">Kikuyu</a> and not an Englishman, as a result of growing up speaking the Kikuyu tongue to everyone but his parents, and thinking in Kikuyu at least into his twenties. Are there such things as Anglo-Africans ?</dd>

<dd>However it doesn't make sense to apply the term 'Anglo-Indian' to a person of European descent who happened to be born in India but moved away at an early age, and has no self identification as an AI; for example, <a href="../../../v/i/v/Vivien_Leigh_c566.html" title="Vivien Leigh">Vivien Leigh</a>, cited under 'Notable Persons' in the article.</dd>

<dd>Regarding Kipling, it is problematic to what extent he considered himself AI. It is significant that in the <a href="../../../j/u/n/Jungle_Book_644b.html" title="Jungle Book">Jungle Book</a>, the animals - Mowgli's best and only friends - reason and speak in much the same way as Kipling represents native Indians as doing, for example in <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kim.html" title="Kim">Kim</a>. Mowgli is a human adopted by animals, who prove to be better and wiser than humans. Ultimately Mowgli must return to his own heritage, but he preserves the lessons he has learned from that other 'culture', which have made him what he is. This perhaps speaks to the question as to what extent Kipling considered himself an Indian. Cspalletta 11:41, 23 September 2005 (UTC)-</dd>

<p>There does not seem to be a community of people called Anglo-Africans. A major distinguishing feature of the Anglo-Indian community is just that - they are a community. They've evolved their own expressions, foods, culture, and traditions. A person who happens to be born today of a British father and an Indian mother does not become an "Anglo-Indian" as the term is currently used. The "persons not temporarily domiciled in India" was part of a definition created a long time ago and is ripe for revision. Personally, I think it's time to coin a new definition to replace the AIAIA one. The new one should be built around what is the Anglo-Indian community today. Perhaps a second definition can be offered for those who may consider themselves to be of both British and Indian descent but who aren't from the Anglo-Indian community. <a href="../../../p/o/w/User%7EPoweroid_35e1.html" title="User:Poweroid">Poweroid</a> 12:43, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>A.I.s are established as a community and a person born today of mixed Anglo and Indian parentage does not share any of the cultural traits of that community. Yet, there is no other word to define them.

<p>I was reading a number of English books from the colonial and post-colonial period and they use the term "Anglo-Indian" to refer to British people settled in India, particularly Kipling. Shouldnt this definition be included as well?</p>

<p>This is a diffiult and confused subject. Some of the people cited, eg George Orwell, were surely not of mixed race. If being born in India makes someone Anglo-Indian, why not add Rudyard Kipling and John Masters for example? Then there are people of mixed Indian and British ancestry who would not consider themselves Anglo-Indian, such as the Newcastle born Michael Chopra or the former Conservative MP, Jonathan Sayeed. And how about Nasser Hussain?</p>
<p>In the light of this, I'm not going to add to or subtract from either list, but you could add Kevin Keelan, the former Norwich City goalkeeper, or another footballer, Ricky Hippolyte, who played for Crystal Palace in the seventies.</p>

<p>212.219.145.102 has made some very good points in his/her edit but I have a problem with the Indiachild.com as a reference source. Their entire content on AIs is about half a dozen paragraphs long (i.e. they aren't really any authority on the subject). But the real issue is that their content isn't even accurate. From their site: "Unlike the Parsis, relatively few have attained high levels of education, amassed great wealth, or achieved more than subordinate government positions". This is patently untrue and the Indian armed forces alone provides ample evidence in the form of the numerous Anglo-Indians who've been awarded military honours, titles and very senior positions. Bear in mind that the community was only about 200,000 strong at Independence and has been getting smaller since. While AIs accounted for less than 0.02% of the Indian population it's a fact that they accounted for over 5% of senior position in the Indian Navy alone... and 10% of Admirals in the Navy were Anglo-Indians. Their contributions in other areas is also quite marked.</p>
<p>The new edit also has: "The origins of the community can be traced to the the East India Company's policy to establish a mixed race population in 17th century India that would be Protestant and loyal to the the King and to the Company and perhaps also their long term employees natural wish to put down roots and start legitamate families."</p>
<p>So why are most Anglo-Indians Roman Catholic? There is no evidence that the AI community came about through a strategic plan. The way I see it is that there were three aspects to the formation of the community: 1) Intermarriages between royals and senior staff in the East India Company/British Government which were strategic military/territorial alliances (If my borther marries your sister it's unlikely you'll invade our princely state as we are now family) 2) Indian women getting pregnant by Europeans as a result of rape or consensual sexual encounters and 3) Natural marriages between western men settled in India who wanted to create roots there ...and agreeable Indian women.</p>

<p><i>The official definition of Anglo-Indian, however, is slightly wider: "Anglo-Indian means a person whose father or any of whose other male progenitors in the male line is or was of European descent but who is domiciled within the territory of India and is or was born within such territory of parents habitually resident therein and not established there for temporary purposes only".

<p>"What's with all the focus on Calcutta, Bandel, Hooghly?" Poweroid - Gosh, I don't think any serious student of British India would ask such a question. Calcutta was the capital of British India in the late 18th century, throughout the 19th century and right up until 1912. Founded in the 17th century, it was the capital of the first major province of the British empire in India. Bandel &amp; Hooghly are now more or less part of greater Calcutta.Your critique that if we were to include Calcutta we would have to start including places like Trichy has no logic. As the political and economic centre of the British Raj, to discuss how events unfolded in Calcutta (which always had a knock on effect for the rest of British India) is quite logical and fair.</p>
<p>That should answer your question.</p>
<p>"There is no evidence that the Anglo-Indian community came about from anything other than simple inter-marriages/unions of British and Indians." Correct! Very very correct! I was not trying to say that the British did it on purpose, nevertheless the British were in fact fearful of this fanciful outcome. I have included proof of this from the highest possible source.</p>
<p>"I'm reverting to an older copy of the article." That was a bit heavy handed my friend. The "History" section was pretty pathetic and empty, it only really had a little to say about 1947. At least now it carries (for a second time) information about what was going on in the 19th century, or do you think that nothing is better than something? Even information re AI's in India's former British capital is better than nothing. You're free to rub out whatever you like, but the question is, can you replace my information with something better? If so - I would love to read it!</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope I've made it all clearer this time.</p>

<p>I'm an AI from Ripon Lane (Off Elliot Road). I agree about the importance of Calcutta to the Raj. However, the focus of this article isn't the Raj, it's AIs, and they occur in considerable concentrations outside of Cal ... most of which cities don't even get a mention. If you wish to argue the history angle there is sizeable amount of history relating to AIs from outside Calcutta, their contributions to the world and to the AI condition. Without any of that the article is still very Calcutta focused. I don't have the heart to revert your current edit as you have obviously expended a large amount of time and effort. And I don't have the time to match your input with history of AIs from Hyderabad, Vizag, Khurda Rd, various TN raliway colonies, Agra, Delhi, Ranchi, the mining areas (how did so many get into mining anyway?) or cities now in Pakistan. Maybe I'll attempt a major revision to the article at another time.</p>

<p>1. If you disagree with the Indian Constitution's definition of Anglo-Indian feel free to tell us what definition you would like to use instead.

<p>&gt;&gt; Often Anglo-Indian can trace their origins to mean serving with serving in the East India Company and their policy to create a mixed race protestant community.</p>
<p>Two issues with that</p>
<p>1. I don't know any A.I. who can actually trace his origins that far with any degree of certainty. What's your source?</p>
<p>2. What's your source also for the claim that the EIC had a "policy" to "create a mixed race protestant community"?</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; However many Anglo-Indian also have Dutch, French, Danish or Portuguese bloodlines</p>
<p>No, they don't. Someone of mixed Dutch and Indian blood would be Dutch-Indian, not Anglo-Indian. There are various definitions of Anglo-Indian - from that of the All India Anglo Indian Association to that of the Indian Constitution - and none of them include decendants of assorted other European nationalities/cultures. I appreciate that these Eurasians who are not Anglo-Indians are even smaller in number than the A.I.s themselves and that aligning themselves with the A.I.s gives them numerous benefits - including access to preferentials seats in the Indian Legislative Assemblies and Parliament - but that does not co-opt them into a community and culture that is very distinct from their own.</p>
<p>Sure, you can take "Anglo" in the wider sense to mean Anglo-Saxon ethnicity but you may want to create a new term to encompass ALL Eurasians including the Anglo-Indian. The term, Anglo-Indian, however, is already taken and has a meaning and culture that goes back to before you were born :)</p>

<p>I don't think you can, unless you can show sources discrediting my info, there is no reason for an objection. Youâre presenting a one-sided view from Indian Laws, which was influenced historically influenced by the British to protect their Extremely Small Anglo-Indian Minority (0.00028 % / 100.00000 %). This does not represent the Past or Present actuality of the situation. Your trying to present a false illusion that ONLY Male British and Female Indians had kids, and thatâs how it is.
