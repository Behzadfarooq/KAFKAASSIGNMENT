<p>Also, if you aren't able to stop this mess, could you please pass this on to someone who can? I've tried mediation, and nobody there will help. I've tried contacting another admin, and that did nothing. This harassment has been going on for some time now and the poor response to it is IMO an embarassment to Wikipedia. The ability of Wikipedia to enforce its official policy is looking questionable right now, and if this continues on Wikipedia is going to lose my support. -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 07:27, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey Angr, I am sorry to bother you with this, but I have to because I know you are an expert on linguistics. I am trying to explain to <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFritz_Saalfeld_18b1.html" title="User:Fritz Saalfeld">User:Fritz Saalfeld</a> that band names are collective nouns and that they are singular. Since X number of members make up one band. For example, "<a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Radicals_e344.html" title="New Radicals">New Radicals</a> was an American rock band" not "New Radicals were an American rock band." Also the user keeps on saying that it should be plural because the name of the band is plural. I am not good at explaining things so can you help me out by explaining this to him and/or enlighten me further. You can find the conversation at both of mine and his talk pages. Thanks! <a href="../../../r/j/n/User%7ERJN_4c2b.html" title="User:RJN">RJN</a> 17:48, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry to bother you again, but I don't know who else to turn to. Can you tell <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFritz_Saalfeld_18b1.html" title="User:Fritz Saalfeld">User:Fritz Saalfeld</a> that "<a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Radicals_e344.html" title="New Radicals">New Radicals</a> was an American rock band" is correct usage in American English? He thinks that because the name of a band has "s" meaning it is plural. His rationale is that the band's name is plural. Please tell him that a band's name does not effect the grammar of the sentence. Thanks! <a href="../../../r/j/n/User%7ERJN_4c2b.html" title="User:RJN">RJN</a> 19:06, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Angr, just wanted to check with you as RJN apparently isn't very interested in discussing this. He claims "New Radicals", "New York Yankees", "The Muppets", "The Beatles" etc. are singular, which seems rather strange to me. I understand the concept of collective nouns, I'm just not sure these are collective nouns, especially since a page RJN posted stated that collective nouns are singular in form. Now he claims these are singular because they are collective nouns, which seems to be a paradoxon to me. Also, as <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_and_British_English_differences_6ac2.html#Singular_and_plural_for_nouns" title="American and British English differences">Singular and plural for nouns</a> states the plural form is correct in both British and American English ("Proper nouns which are plural in form take a plural verb in both American and British English."; and even gives an example with band names for this), I think this form should be prefered on Wikipedia over the singular form RJN keeps reverting to. --<a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFritz_Saalfeld_18b1.html" title="User:Fritz Saalfeld">Fritz Saalfeld</a> (<a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFritz_Saalfeld_515f.html" title="User talk:Fritz Saalfeld">Talk</a>) 19:12, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There isn't really an edit war going on here, I just found the changes he made somewhat strange, especially given the plural is used on several articles - including FAs - and I think it's unlikely that "New York Yankees", "The Muppets", "The Beatles" are grammatically singular. --<a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFritz_Saalfeld_18b1.html" title="User:Fritz Saalfeld">Fritz Saalfeld</a> (<a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFritz_Saalfeld_515f.html" title="User talk:Fritz Saalfeld">Talk</a>) 19:24, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Angr. I notice that you closed off the above AfD. Since there were only three users contributing to the AfD, I reckon it would be more appropriate to relist for more input. But maybe I'm biased, as I don't think this band deserves an article yet. What do you think?

<p>Another User:SimonP has thought it worthwhile to add that the article needs "cleanup".

<p>Despite my personal opinion that en.wikipedia is well beyond sanity in inflated category use, I've just tried to question one specific abuse: Should articles on languages be categorized according to membership in hypothetical/disputed/fringe language groups? I've taken Category:Dene-Caucasian languages as an example, but there are more, see the subcategories of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Category%7EProposed_language_families_1c4c.html" title="Category:Proposed language families">Category:Proposed language families</a>.</p>

<p>I'm writing to ask your assistance. Matt Crypto has taken it upon himself unilaterally to remove certain images from my user page and block editing. I cannot edit my own user page.

<dd>Your unblocking was unjustified. I wish you'd engage in discussion rather than just undoing it. She's being disruptive and unhelpful to the project.

<dd>She e-mailed me and asked me to unblock her. I looked at what she had done (removed Fred Bauder's comment from her user page, which was justified since comments are supposed to be left on talk pages), and looked at Fred's reason for blocking her ("Discourtesy, refusal to disuss significant issues") and Phil (Snowspinner)'s reason for extending her block ("Fred's earlier block + personal attacks against Fred"). Then I read all the comments she had made to Fred and found nothing that could be construed as a personal attack. Anger and incivility, perhaps, but no personal attacks. Then I read <a href="../../../b/p/_/WP%7EBP_c8aa.html" title="WP:BP">WP:BP</a> to see if anything she had done warranted a block. The only section of that page that is even relevant is "Disruption", which says: "Sysops may, at their judgement, block IP addresses or usernames that disrupt the normal functioning of Wikipedia. Such disruption may include changing other users' signed comments, making deliberately misleading edits, harassment, and excessive personal attacks. Users should normally be warned before they are blocked." She did not change anyone's signed comment (although <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AFred_Bauder&amp;diff=34248386&amp;oldid=34248042" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AFred_Bauder&amp;diff=34248386&amp;oldid=34248042" rel="nofollow">he did</a>); she made no deliberately misleading edits; she did not engage in harrassment as defined at <a href="../../../h/a/r/WP%7EHAR_a671.html" title="WP:HAR">WP:HAR</a>; she did not make personal attacks. Moreover, she was not warned before being blocked; she was simply <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Deeceevoice&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=34248734" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Deeceevoice&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=34248734" rel="nofollow">informed after the fact</a>.

<dd>Thanks for the response. I suppose we'll have to agree to disagree. IMO she's had plenty of warning- far more than any other user I can think of would be given. An RFC, an RFAr, and she still continues to try to turn Wikipedia into a battleground instead of an encyclopedia. She's a controversial user, to be sure, so any blocks of her will be controversial. I just wish the controvery didn't make it <i>de facto</i> impossible for her to be blocked, which is why I wish people would explain their disapproval of any such blocks instead of overturning them. I believe that the fact that she cannot be blocked makes her behavior justified in her own mind. I respect that you're doing what you think is right, I just wish it didn't involve overturning blocks. There have been blocks I've disagreed with but not overturned. To me, there's a difference between a controversial block and a blatantly unreasonable block. A blatantly unreasonable block should IMO be overturned easily by anyone who wants to, but I don't see that this block qualifies as blatantly unreasonable. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 18:45, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, she's a controversial user. No argument from me there. I think of her as Wikipedia's <a href="../../../g/a/d/Gadfly_%28social%29.html" title="Gadfly (social)">gadfly</a>. And I would not have undone the block if she had actually done something specific that's a blockable offense under <a href="../../../b/p/_/WP%7EBP_c8aa.html" title="WP:BP">WP:BP</a>. But I just don't see that she did. I do consider Fred's and Phil's blocks blatantly unreasonable. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">tɔk</span></a>) 19:00, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Given her unrepentantly combative behavior, multiple past warnings and blocks, and the fact that she's been around a long time and ought to know better, I see no problem with harsher treatment than would be given, say, a brand new user. She's here to fight a race war, not make an encyclopedia, and thus I see no problem with liberal blocks for disruption. I do see a problem with the de facto impossibility of such blocks, and the message it sends, which is why I wish people would discuss rather than unblocking. If you're very interested in "the letter of the law" of the blocking policy, note that it specifically advises bringing up disputed blocks with the blocking admin, rather than just unblocking. I see that you explained yourself, but only after unblocking. The block was a judgement call, not a blatant error, as I think was made clear by the discussion with people on both sides of the issue. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 19:29, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Her previous blocks were always for something tangible: 3RR violations. This one was for "discourtesy" (violating <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> isn't grounds for blocking) and non-existent personal attacks. And I absolutely reject the proposition that she's de-facto unblockable. Look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3ADeeceevoice" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3ADeeceevoice" rel="nofollow">her block log</a>: this is the first time that anyone has unblocked her other than because of collateral damage or to re-block her for longer.

<dd>Thanks for the barnstar! I don't mind answering questions at all. In fact, the questions you ask show me how to improve the articles, because sometimes you catch typos but aren't sure that's what they are, or you catch me being vague or self-contradictory. So don't hold back <i>too</i> much on the question-asking!&#160;;-) Beir bua! --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">tɔk</span></a>) 19:37, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks, I'll remember that&#160;:) The problem is, most of my questions are the ones a student would ask a teacher (which I do not have); they would do nothing to improve Wikipedia. And improving Wikipedia, not guiding clueless students, is the reason why we are all here. Still, if I have a question an answer to which would benefit both me and this fine encyclopedia, I will not hesitate to contact you. In other cases, I'll just hit the Reference desk&#160;:) Again, thank you so much. Please keep announcing new articles--unlike Bastique above, I have no clue what to watchlist on this topic&#160;:)--<a href="../../../a/g/_/User%7EAg_Foghlaim_ee64.html" title="User:Ag Foghlaim">Ag Foghlaim</a> 19:51, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I hope I’m doing this right, editing the page to reply to your comment—I guess I’ll have to re-read the manual to make sure! In the meantime...</p>
<p>I read the linked point about capitalisation and stand corrected, and will happily conform to the Wikipedia standard of header capitalisation from now on.</p>
<p>However, I’m fanatical about directed quotes and apostrophes; as long as Wikipedia allows them, I plan to fix every single one, one random article at a time. I just think that directed quotes and apostrophes look more professional, more like an actual published work; plus, aesthetically, non-directed quotes really, really bother me, and make me want to not use Wikipedia—which would be unfortunate, because I learn so much about so many things just by going through articles replacing quote marks!</p>
<p>Thank you for the welcome and I will certainly read the links you suggested.&#160;:-)</p>
<dl>
<dd>PS: I forgot to mention that I’m very careful to leave links that contain undirected apostrophes intact and use the | (pipe?) so that the directed version is only the displayed version.&#160;:-)</dd>

<p>I agree with the removal of the O-macron and t-cedille from French. The O-macron required when writing <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokyo.html" title="Tokyo">fr:Tōkyō</a> in French, but is technically part of the romanisation, so not all that useful on the English Wikipedia. The T-cedille was proposed by a linguist, but not used <a href="../../../../fr/c/%C3%A9/d/C%C3%A9dille_en_fran%C3%A7ais.html" class="extiw" title="fr:Cédille_en_français">(on the other hand, this might be why it does have a use in an encyclopedia)</a>. The ae is used when writing Latin words, however (and it is on the special charactes list on the French Wikipedia). In German the Y-umlaut is used in <a href="../../../../de/%C3%BF/_/_/%C5%B8.html" class="extiw" title="de:Ÿ">surnames</a>. The characters with a real umlaut shouldn't be used on the computers, but I though they might be useful in the article on Umlauts. The M in script was used for the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Goldmark.html" title="Goldmark">Goldmark</a>.

<dd>And I just put it back. I can readily find, and have added, sources supporting Celtic Pictish. It shouldn't be difficult, if it remains controversial, to find some published support for non-Celtic Pictish since the turn of the millennium using recent research. The best I could find was Marija Gimbutas in <i>The Living Goddesses</i> (1999), not exactly an uncontroversial work and not post-millennial. Sure, I found more, but they relied on positively ancient research. Lehmann's <i>Theoretical Bases of Indo-European Linguistics</i> (2005) is a good example of this sort of thing. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> 12:24, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's always difficult finding sources arguing against fringe theories like this, because while supporters publish lots, the majority who don't believe them just ignore the issue and don't bother publishing arguments against them. If Pictish is generally omitted from lists of Celtic languages compiled by modern scholars, then the implication is that they do not consider it to be a Celtic language, even if they don't discuss it explicitly. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">tɔk</span></a>) 12:28, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I confess to zero expertise in the matter - I only read the end results - but it seems to me that e.g. Price, Nicolaisen and Forsyth are not cranks. That being so, I don't see how the current orthodoxy can be any more of a fringe theory than Jackson's theory which preceded it. I understood that "P-Celtic Pictish" was also the long-accepted theory before Jackson proposed a non-IE Pictish alongside the Pretenic/Brythonic one. Re Jackson's theory on the <a href="../../../p/i/c/Picts.html" title="Picts">Picts</a> page, where you added a (fact) template, I know where he wrote about this, but I haven't read it myself. Wearing your Wiki-admin hat, is it considered the done thing for me to put in a ref to something I have not actually seen myself (i.e. Glanville Price says Kenneth Jackson says, so I can add "see Jackson, K.H. <i>whatever</i>")&#160;?

<dd>As I understand it (wearing my Celticist hat), the current orthodoxy is neither that Pictish is Brythonic, nor that it is non-IE, but that too little is known about Pictish to know what it is. That's what Ball &amp; Fife say in the introduction to <i>The Celtic Languages</i>, and also what my professors said when I was studying Indo-European linguistics in graduate school. In the introduction to a different book also called <i>The Celtic Languages</i> Donald MacAulay has a diagram making Pictish a sister branch to Brittonic under the heading "P-Celtic" (itself a sister to "Q-Celtic" under "Insular Celtic") but in the text never discusses this. Paul Russell's <i>An Introduction to the Celtic Languages</i> never discusses Pictish at all. Wearing my admin hat, I think it's fine to give the bibliographical information of a source you haven't read, though you should probably be careful not to put words in Jackson's mouth before reading him yourself. I also want to make it clear that I'm all in favor of saying that there are people who have argued that Pictish is Brythonic, and citing those sources, but I don't think it's NPOV to present that as the current <i>communis opinio</i>. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">tɔk</span></a>) 09:12, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You need to take a look at the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_languages.html" title="Iranian languages">Iranian languages</a> page. I am in a edit war with a certain contributor there. The page is on Iranian languages, yet the contributor keeps adding many paragraphs on the language history of Azerbaijan. It is rather nationalistic in its tone. Do we need over half the page on Iranian languages how Azerbaijan was once Iranian speaking? Shouldn't this be on the Languages of Azerbaijan page. He also quotes a government controlled language source. This is just a horribly written article. Who could take it seriously. <a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImperial78_63a1.html" title="User:Imperial78">Imperial78</a> 01:16, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, sorry I have to answer as Béarla, ach níl Gaeilge agam ach cúpla focal. I do have both of those <i>An Teanga Beo</i> books (as well as the ones for Corca Dhuibhne and Gaeilge Chléire). The source for the vocabulary is mostly the <i>Linguistic Atlas and Survey of Irish Dialects</i> by H. Wagner. The source for the phonology is listed (Ní Chasaide 1999). The source for the morphology I don't remember; it's just stuff I picked up along the way somewhere. That said, it's probably all in Mícheál Ó Siadhail's <i>Modern Irish: Grammatical Structure and Dialectal Variation</i>, I just haven't tracked down the specific claims to that book yet. The syntax stuff you added, so finding a source is up to you!&#160;;-) Beir bua --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> 22:29, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Ah, I have a source for that, though I need to sort it out more... I am a long way from Min na Leice at the moment, and the only source I have here is a copy of <i>Caisleain Oir</i>, so I was going through it and marking typically Ulster constructions out for citation in that section, but have suddenly been attacked by a rampant workload, so won't be doing it just yet. I think it's an excellent start as it is, and well done. The morphology is fine, as far as I can see. There were one or two things in the vocabulary list that struck me as odd, and that was why I was impelled to suggest the <i>Teanga Beo</i> book - "tinn" and "Gaeilig" instead of "Gaeilic".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>One more question: would it not be better, in general, for the vocabulary at least, to talk about variations relative to other dialects rather than variations relative to the standard language?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Oh, and while I'm at it, how do we refer to forms (such as the synthetic form, or the absolute form of verbs such as chím, which are in line with the pre-Caighdean Oifigiuil literary language?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, the article on initial mutations indicates incorrectly that <i>l</i> and <i>n</i> do not lenite; perhaps you are in a position to fix that? <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 23:04, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Angr. Can I ask you to mediate a dispute, <a href="../../../w/%C5%82/a/Talk%7EW%C5%82adys%C5%82aw_II_Jagie%C5%82%C5%82o_f1c8.html" title="Talk:Władysław II Jagiełło">Talk:Władysław II Jagiełło</a>. It concerns the naming of the Lithuanian ruler Jogaila, who also became King of Poland, as Wladislaus II. The current title is <a href="../../../w/%C5%82/a/W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw_II_Jagie%C5%82%C5%82o_0ac3.html" title="Władysław II Jagiełło">Władysław II Jagiełło</a>, which, along with other rulers of Poland, violates general wiki rules for naming monarchs (although Polish users a little while ago agreed amongst themselves to Polonize the names of all Polish monarchs, moving all the articles in correspondence with this decision). This I personally have little objection to (although others might), but Jogaila was not even Polish nor solely a Polish ruler, and the latter means he is not governed by "rules" "agreed" for Polish monarchs. I moved the page to <a href="../../../j/o/g/Jogaila_of_Lithuania_4ad4.html" title="Jogaila of Lithuania">Jogaila of Lithuania</a>. I may or may not have been wrong in the first place for moving it, but I saw this as uncontroversial, as my experience has taught be that it is far more common to refer to him by his Lithuanian name Jogaila, or the corruption thereof Jagiello, and seemed sensible on almost every other ground I could think of. This was objected to by some Polish contributors. Eventually, it had seemed that compromise was reached with <a href="../../../j/o/g/Jogaila_%28W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw_II%29_5c51.html" title="Jogaila (Władysław II)">Jogaila (Władysław II)</a>, but then another Polish user with admin powers (<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotrus</a>), whose intellectual integrity has been far from obviously displayed, reverted this back to the absurd name. Opinions seem hardened, good counter arguments are not being advanced, and the convo now is producing more heat than light. I'm very busy ATM, and am quite anxious to resolve this, but I can't see it happening. Can you help, or have someone help mediate?

<dd>Thanks! It's interesting translating articles on topics I know nothing about. But I do hope other people come along and edit them, because even after I've translated them out of German, they often still have content that makes it clear it was written in Germany (e.g. the Habitat section of <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garden_dormouse.html" title="Garden dormouse">Garden dormouse</a> or the number of Germans living in <a href="../../../l/l/u/Llucmajor.html" title="Llucmajor">Llucmajor</a>). --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> 10:21, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
