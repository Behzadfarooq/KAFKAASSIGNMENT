<p>I searched for people who mention symbolwiki in hopes of finding like minded people, and found a small comment by you. The concept of symbolwiki is dear to my heart. Thankfully, a similar symbol system already exists, though it has very little internet presence thus far. However, it is not defunct, just no font.

<p><tt>ZOMG you rouge steward!</tt></p>
<p>Remember that little test we did a while back, where you tried to desysop to see if the steward interface was still disconnected from en.wiki? At the time, since it didn't actually work, we didn't bother to do a "resysopping"; it seems a bit silly to me, actually, but I've now been asked about it, and expect I might be again in the future. Also, it seems to have befuddled Interiot's tool; it records me as a bureaucrat and checkuser, but not a sysop, even though my flag never faltered in the en database. Would you mind to "resysop" me just for appearances sake; I'd do it myself, but I suspect it would just land me on ANI for being a rogue bureaucrat. <tt>:)</tt> <span style="font-family:Sans serif"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <font color="#7B68EE">(<small><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">Talk</font></a> • <font color="#7B68EE">Connect</font></small>)</font></span> 07:45, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, I'm not sure I can since the bug that let me do that has been fixed, so now if I try to sysop you, it just says you already are one.

<p>hello, i am brand new to wikipedia, and am very confused as to the whole tagging buisness. I added a very famous pic of Christine and Léa Papin to the entry on them, and i credited the source, but i don't know how to tag the picture... The photographer is unknown, and the exact date is unknown, but the picture was taken circa 1927-1931. I think that the picture is considered to be "public domain", but I still don't kow what the hell I'm meant to tag it as, there is so much confusing info... could you please help me?</p>

<p>Hello, Angela!</p>
<p>I am still interested in working on an Activism project, but several users have commented that my vision, which includes suggestions of ways to contribute to various movements, is POV. So I've taken your suggestion, and am about to start working there. But I wanted to know something about the etiquette there. (I'm asking you because you are one of the few users who has done anything there. I have already asked Mark Dilley, but I wanted your point of view.) Is it supposed to operate in much the same way as Wikipedia? For example, can I add/improve/move content without getting permission first? A lot of the pages seem like personal essays or narratives rather than like professional, impersonal encyclopedia articles. Maybe that is just a reflection of the small number of authors?</p>
<p>I don't know if you are even active at all on Wikia Activism. You originally emailed me from an email address based there, though. Do you know if it is possible to create categories for articles within Activism? I don't see any ability to do this.</p>
<p>If you could give me some advice, I'd really appreciate it. Email is probably best, though you could comment on my <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Nabarry" class="extiw" title="meta:User_talk:Nabarry">user talk page</a> at meta.</p>

<dd>Wikia sites don't need to have an NPOV policy, though some of them do. I don't believe <a href="http://www.wikia.com/wiki/c:activism" class="extiw" title="wikiasite:activism">Wikiasite:activism</a> does though. You can move content between there and Wikipedia since both sites are GFDL, but make sure you understand the terms of that license. Wikia has a <a href="http://www.wikia.com/wiki/c:Template:Wikipedia" class="extiw" title="wikia:Template:Wikipedia">template</a> that you can copy for giving attribution to the original article at Wikipedia if you do copy content from here. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a></dd>

<dd>Thanks Angela. We really needed the image when I wrote this. Yesterday, though, I had a tour on Flickr and found very good images which the author has been happy to release under the GNU FDL. So we have now enough illustrations for <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blade_server.html" title="Blade server">blade server</a>&#160;:) The Intel image would still be welcome, if nothing else because all images we have now are of IBM servers, but that is not intentional; there's no bias toward one vendor or another.

<p>Hi Angela, You may recall that you originally enabled the Robert Priddy page on Wiki. On that page I have come under attack there with the following edit: " Contrary Viewpoints A Closer Look At Robert Priddy And His Claims Against Sathya Sai Baba by Gerald Moreno " He has threatened (on the Robert Priddy discussion page) me with deletion of my page and various links to my websites if I do not allow this 'Contrary Viewpoint' to stand. Well, I would accept reasonable and rational fact-based criticism of my work and my activities. However, as you can see if you open the Moreno website against me he not only unlawfully uses a photograph of myself and my son (which he has refused to remove after polite requests from my son), but he copies materials from my books and websites unlawfully, infringing copyright. I can provide full details of these infringements, if it is not obvious enough just by visiting his pages. Moreno attacks all critics of the self-proclaimed God the Father, Sathya Sai Baba, and goes out of his way to defame them and invade their privacy. He is a persistent stalker of critics of Sai Baba, phoning any person he can to try to dig dirt of them. Please look at one example on the webpage of a prominent critic of Sai Baba, Mr. Conny Larsson, <a href="http://www.saibabaexpose.com/vishvarupa.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.saibabaexpose.com/vishvarupa.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and not least also <a href="http://www.saibabaexpose.com/JoeFAQ.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.saibabaexpose.com/JoeFAQ.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Therefore, Thanking you for any assistance you may be able to offer to adjudicate in this matter. I would ask you simply permanantly to remove the entry by Moreno on the Robert Priddy page, without - as he suggests - altering any of the links to my websites in my page or on the Sathya Sai Baba main page. Only if he should remove from his pages all clearly defamatory statements against myself and the copyright photo and non-permitted use of my texts. Thanks, Robert Priddy</p>
<dl>
<dd>I suggest you send an email to info-en@wikimedia.org since people there will have more time to look into this. You can also use the article's talk page to explain your removals since otherwise unexplained deletions can be seen as vandalism, especially in cases of <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">auto-biography</a>, which are strongly discouraged. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 12:32, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You will see the determination of Moreno to try to stop you knowing what I wrote by the fact that he has deleted my request to you in your user paeg (see below on the discussion page). Just goes to emphasise my point. Moreno is a full-time stalker and defamer. Robert Priddy</p>

<dd>Thanks, but I can't write in Hindi. It would be better to give people a link to that page rather than fill up their talk page with a copy of it.

<p>Hi I can not figure out were to reply to you. Sorry if this is the wrong place.</p>
<p>It is part of the culture of football that each player has a song. I wrote down Luis's song. It is not rubbish. You might want to tell 40 000 people every week that sing it is rubbish. I once flew 6 000 miles so I could support my team in Istanbul by singing such songs.</p>
<p>Do you understand now that this is not rubbish and it is part of this players history at the club?</p>
<p>Please advise, Christian</p>

<p>As you may have gathered, discussions have been raging for about a week on <a href="../../../e/s/p/WT%7EESP_1b68.html" title="WT:ESP">the <i>Esperanza</i> talk page</a> as to the future direction of Esperanza. Some of these are still ongoing and warrant more input (such as the idea to scrap the members list altogether). However, some decisions have been made and the charter has hence been amended. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AEsperanza%2FCharter&amp;diff=59977509&amp;oldid=52572171" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AEsperanza%2FCharter&amp;diff=59977509&amp;oldid=52572171" rel="nofollow">See what happened</a>. Basically, the whole leadership has had a reshuffle, so please review the new, improved charter.</p>
<p>As a result, we are electing 4 people this month. They will replace <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoanneB_e69b.html" title="User:JoanneB">JoanneB</a> and <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">Pschemp</a> and form a new tranche A, serving until December. Elections will begin on <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../j/u/l/July_2.html" title="July 2">07-02</a> and last until <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../j/u/l/July_9.html" title="July 9">07-09</a>. If you wish to run for a Council position, add your name to the list before <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../j/u/l/July_2.html" title="July 2">07-02</a>.

<p>Hi Angela,</p>
<p>I was just wondering if you could have a look at a little problem I have... A while back, I created an account (Christopher Denman). I then created another account accidentially, "Christopher denman" (note the lowercase!), and didn't realise (therefore carried on using the new account). The issue is that I now have two accounts with their own separate edit histories. if you merged them I don't really mind which account becomes the "real" one.</p>

<dd>Hi... Thanks anyway. Fortunately I didn't have too many posts on my other account so re. the edit histories it doesn't really matter! However, would it be possible to delete the "Christopher Denman" account, or if that isn't possible to rename it to something very different, to avoid confusion?--<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_denman_693b.html" title="User:Christopher denman">Christopher</a> 07:21, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Could you please take a look at the <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordon_Griffith_1bc1.html" title="Gordon Griffith">Gordon Griffith</a> article, it is unique in that it is probably the most comprehensive source of information on its subject. I put together information from public primary and secondary sources that have never been placed in the same location before. It is my hope that this falls within "research that consists of collecting and organizing information from existing primary and/or secondary sources is, of course, strongly encouraged," however the word "synthesis" in the <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">no original research policy</a> still concerns me, since an article this extensive has never existed before.

<p>Hi Angela, I have a question to ask that only a WM Trustee could probably answer.

<p>Hello, I was just skimming through Wikipedians and it seems you have helped a lot of people and responded to various questions. My question is this: I want to upload an image. It shows two French actors performing a play and appears to be professional but I don't think it counts as copyrighted since it is <i>very</i> old, goes back to 1883. How should I tag it? I am really confused with all the different tagging categories. Is this picture free, unlicenced?

<p>Hi - I was wondering if you might have an opinion on the chances of getting Jimbo's attention with any of the stable version proposals (e.g. <a href="../../../s/t/a/Wikipedia%7EStable_versions_171e.html" title="Wikipedia:Stable versions">wikipedia:stable versions</a> or <a href="../../../s/t/a/Wikipedia%7EStatic_version_56df.html" title="Wikipedia:Static version">wikipedia:static version</a>). I think most of the proposed mechanisms are way too Nupedia-like, but I think the fundamental concept of separating the viewable version from the editable version of articles (without forking) is entirely worth pursuing. This recently came up at <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28proposals%29_6eab.html#Mark_articles_as_COMPLETE.2FSTABLE" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (proposals)">Wikipedia:Village pump (proposals)#Mark articles as COMPLETE/STABLE</a>. I outlined what I think would be a workable solution some time ago at <a href="../../../s/t/a/Wikipedia_talk%7EStable_versions_archive2_950e.html#forking_considered_harmful" title="Wikipedia talk:Stable versions/archive2">Wikipedia talk:Stable versions/archive2#forking considered harmful</a>. As far as I can tell, no progress is being made on anything like this and won't ever be unless there's some edict from the very top. The question is do you think this might be worth pursuing and, if so, how? I'd very much appreciate any advice you might have to offer about this. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">talk</a>)</small> 22:33, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think stable versions in general are worth pursuing, but I believe it requires technical changes, not a declaration from Jimbo. It's the people with PHP ability you need to talk to if you want something to happen with this. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 11:56, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I completely agree it requires technical changes, but it seems like it might boil down to a chicken and egg thing where no one's going to make the changes unless there's an agreement for how it's going to work but there won't ever be such an agreement if people can't see a prototype in action. You wouldn't happen to have any developers in mind, would you&#160;:). I could perhaps even personally develop the mechanism I outlined at <a href="../../../s/t/a/Wikipedia_talk%7EStable_versions_archive2_950e.html#forking_considered_harmful" title="Wikipedia talk:Stable versions/archive2">Wikipedia talk:Stable versions/archive2#forking considered harmful</a>, but enabling it at en.wikipedia would boil down to a policy decision. In any event, I'll run this by Brion and see what he says (although he's been a little prickly to various other suggestions I've made, so I don't have high hopes that he'll say anything remotely like "oh, great idea, I'll get right on that!"). -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">talk</a>)</small> 16:20, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Angela: I noticed some people on wikien-l that <a href="../../../l/i/g/Lightsaber_combat.html" title="Lightsaber combat">Lightsaber combat</a> had a lot of pushback because it is, well, not based on fact. I really think that anything that is still under copyright should be transwiki'ed over to Wikia - not to return until the copyright expires (which is usually so far into the future as to be "forever"). I think that <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blade_Runner_090c.html" title="Blade Runner">Blade Runner</a> would be an excellent example because it is a Featured Article that is about fiction - and I really like RoyBoy who had a lot to do with making that page FA. Even then entire <a href="../../../t/h/e/Themes_in_Blade_Runner_8147.html" title="Themes in Blade Runner">Themes in Blade Runner</a> is, well, speculation and analysis at best - not fact at all. My view is that all fiction under copyright (which is almost all science fiction except for Jules Verne), all TV shows and most films and books all belong over at Wikia. If you look at <a href="http://www.wikia.com/wiki/c:bladerunner" class="extiw" title="wikia:bladerunner">wikia:bladerunner</a>, you will see that the main "Blade Runner" page is just a copy from Wikipedia anyway. You know, <a href="http://bladerunner.wikia.com/wiki/Blade_Runner" class="external text" title="http://bladerunner.wikia.com/wiki/Blade_Runner" rel="nofollow">this thing</a>. It is out-of-date and is loaded with red links. It is all fiction or "fact" based on fiction. I realize that it appear self-interested for you to take a stand on such a proposition, but I was wondering: can you offer any reaction to such an idea?</p>
<p>One other minor issue: I pointed <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_David_Steele_6073.html" title="Robert David Steele">Robert David Steele</a> towards Wikia. He seems to be trying to create an activist community around <a href="../../../o/s/i/OSINT_beaa.html" title="OSINT">OSINT</a>, but his viewpoint is narowly US military. I am still trying to sort this out with him on the OSINT page and its talk page since this term is also clearly used by some civilians. This paragraph is just a heads up in case you run into him at Wikimania, which I think he plans to attend. -- 75.26.5.242 01:59, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't understand - what does the copyright status of the subject of an article have to do with anything? I see no reason there can't be an article on <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blade_Runner_090c.html" title="Blade Runner">Blade Runner</a> on Wikipedia. Obviously there is content which fits better on a dedicated <a href="http://www.wikia.com/wiki/c:bladerunner" class="extiw" title="wikiasite:bladerunner">Blade Runner Wiki</a>, but that certainly shouldn't mean Wikipedia should give up all of its fiction-related content. I think Robert Steele should get his own website since he doesn't seem to be very keen on collaborating. Wikia is about building communities, not just a dumping ground for Wikipedia's banned users.&#160;:) <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 11:56, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, Angela, I am a disgruntled (but polite) "perennial former Wikipedian"&#160;;-/ and I am curious about this particular AfD nomination.

<dd>and the sociopolitical infrastructure (and to some extent, the software infrastructure) of Wikipedia, as I try to briefly explain on <a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">my user page</a>. It seems you (Angela) are also becoming fed up with the rather cumbersome process for reverting the insertion of slanted information, misinformation, and disinformation in at least one (unimproveable?) Wikipedia article. It is tempting for me, as a disaffected former contributor who has left (or at least, is perennially leaving) because of frustration over quality control, to interpret this as an admission from a leading Wikipedian that the Wikipedia community cannot improve at least some articles which are important for the project. (BTW, I think it's important that accurate basic information about you be available somewhere for anyone researching policies/decisions in which you may have been involved.)</dd>
<dd>On your user page you say <i>"there are a lot of changes planned to the structure of the Foundation"</i>. Will these changes extend, as I hope, to changes in core policy and/or infrastructure designed to further the goal of building a high quality encyclopedia? Where can I read about these forthcoming changes? I would be grateful for any enlightenment you can offer!</dd>
<dd>I also have a question regarding an allegation on my user page, where I complain that apparently there is no Advisory Board which regularly reviews and updates Wikipedia policies as needed to adapt to the evolving nature of the project and its "threat environment". Is this true? Er... I just reread my own user page and I certainly came down rather hard on this (nonexistent?) Advisory Board, so I must admit that I really should have tried harder to find out who if anyone bears responsibility for reviewing core WP policies <i>before</i> I wrote my rant&#160;:-/ Oh well, if I was misinformed or unfair I will rewrite my user page again.

<p>Angela, I've only just heard of your decision to resign from the board of trustees. As one who enthusiastically voted for you each time, I am truly sorry to see you go. I don't know if you know this, but you were one of the very first Wikipedians to greet me back in early 2004.

<dd>I wasn't notable before I resigned, but people voted "keep" because I was on the Board and <i>not</i> because they actually thought I was notable. Therefore, I thought my resignation would leave them with no reason to vote "keep" this time. If I had actually been notable, the AfD outcome might have been the same this time, but considering how borderline it was and the complete lack of consensus regarding the article, I thought the resignation would be enough to change the outcome of this AfD. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 06:56, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>Well, my reasoning was that seeing as each biography page is a subpage it has links to its parent pages (e.g. in your case '&lt; Presenters | Angela Beesley') in a prominent position anyway.

<dd>I didn't notice those subpage links. Anyway, they're part of the software, not the content, so they're not guaranteed to stay and main namespace pages don't usually have those subpage links. They're also not going to be there is the content is mirrored elsewhere. The links I added are now within &lt;noinclude&gt; tags so they'll only be seen when that page is viewed by itself. I think all the pages should have those links so that they make sense independantly and not only when included in another page since they are in the main namespace and not in templates. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 12:44, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, and the thing which worries me is that as Wikipedia and the web itself continue to rapidly evolve, there is no genuine <i>leadership</i> at WP which can react effectively to problems which challenge core values or entrenched principles of Wikipedia political philosophy, if I might so put it. I fear that without intervention by some higher power, the cumbersome nature of the current WP process for consideration of changes of policy will lead to the ruination of the Wikipedia as an encyclopedia to which users like me can feel proud to have contributed. I've tried to make a start at explaining why I have come to such a dismal conclusion on my <a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">user page</a> and would be grateful for any feedback from you.

<p>Hello, Angela! I'm a user of Russian Wikipedia <a href="../../../../ru/l/o/k/User%7ELoKi_9e70.html" class="extiw" title="ru:User:LoKi">ru:User:LoKi</a>. Some time ago I tried to register in English Wikipedia, but the same username was occupied, so I made another - <a href="../../../f/e/u/User%7EFeuer_062c.html" title="User:Feuer">User:Feuer</a>. Due to coming <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Single_login_specifications" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Single_login_specifications" rel="nofollow">Single login process</a> I went to userpage of User:LoKi to see who he is and maybe try to discuss the matter of renaming his account, because I'm registered as LoKi in ruwiki, commons, meta, ruwiktionary and ruwikiquotes. But the page is empty and so is his contribution tree. It seems that the user has registered some time ago and has never done an edit since then. Is it possible to rename my <b><a href="../../../f/e/u/User%7EFeuer_062c.html" title="User:Feuer">User:Feuer</a></b> account <b>to User:LoKi</b> since the person doesn't need it? I would appreciate it much if you could do such a renaming. Also I usually make a redirect from "Loki" to "LoKi", and it would be great if you could free <a href="../../../l/o/k/User%7ELoki_0c78.html" title="User:Loki">User:Loki</a> (which is also empty) for me, but this second request is not so significant as the first one.

<dd>I disagree with the process of name stealing. If someone else registered that name, then they have every right to keep it. How do you know there is not an active user using that name on another language Wikipedia? Perhaps they made the name here for the same reason you are trying to and they want it for when single login comes in.

<p>Hello, Angela. I think that English Wikipedia has a big problem.</p>
<p>In the article <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Serbs_d101.html" title="List of Serbs">List of Serbs</a>, one can't find <a href="../../../i/v/o/Ivo_Andri%C4%87_3ee1.html" title="Ivo Andrić">Ivo Andrić</a>, the most famous Serbian writer, winner of the Nobel prize. He in deed was of Croatian origin, but he was declaring as Serb for entire his life and he wrote in Serbian. There is no one single Serbian child who hasn't heard about Andric, "the best Serbian writer". And many other people from other countries know that Andric is one of the most prominent Serbs. Now, when somebody sees that there is no Andric on the List of Serbs, what could he think? I have added him, but one user from Croatia reverted my edit. Now just imagine that somebody new to Wikipedia sees that there is no Andric and adds him, and somebody else reverts his edit. What would he think then? He would think that Wikipedia is just a stupid game or joke, and certainly not an "encyclopaedia" that claims to be the biggest one ever. &gt;:(</p>
<p>On the other hand, in the article <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Croats_4dba.html" title="List of Croats">List of Croats</a> you can find people who are not Croats at all, but are in some way connected with Croats or Croatia. How come that's not possible for the List of Serbs, too?</p>
<p>There is also <a href="../../../r/u/%C4%91/Ru%C4%91er_Bo%C5%A1kovi%C4%87_0513.html" title="Ruđer Bošković">Ruđer Bošković</a>, a scientist whose mother was Italian and father was a Serb. Obviously, English Wikipedia (just like Croatian Wikipedia) claims that he is a Croat! How interesting, I wonder how can somebody be a Croat if his ancestors are not connected to Croatia at all... Now, *this* is original research, isn't it?&#160;:)</p>
<p>You just can't believe how angry I am now. I thought that there are more people on English Wikipedia who do take care about the regularity of the articles. I have been to Croatian and Bosnian Wikipedias, they are just terrific, and I can tell you - English Wikipedia is obviously not much better!&#160;:( --<a href="../../../%D1%92/%D0%BE/%D1%80/User%7E%D0%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%92%D0%B5_%D0%94._%D0%91%D0%BE%D0%B6%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%9B_b2c7.html" title="User:Ђорђе Д.

<dd>Hello Djordje. I shall try to assist you since your question has lingered alone so long. It seems to me that you raise legitimate issues with the ideas on who is a Croat and who is a Serb. Your best option is to contact the people who revert your edits and try to resolve the issue. If that is impossible you will want to seek <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_eaa9.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation">Mediation</a> or <a href="../../../m/e/d/WP%7EMEDCAB_20f1.html" title="WP:MEDCAB">Cabal</a>.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_Archive20_8567.html" title="Edit section: RE: Johnny Lee Clary - Please help">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">RE: Johnny Lee Clary - Please help</span></h2>
<p>Hey there, my name is Nick, my username is Potters house and I have encountered a problem with trying to provide any information about Johnny Lee Clary. I have posted this post off to other staff members also. I am not sure if this is the best route to resolve this, but can think of no other way.</p>
<p>The article Johnny Lee Clary has been deleted. I have known Johnny through telephone conversations and email for a short time now (about 3-4 months). He recently came and shared his life story in for our church group for the first time just two weeks ago. Before I met Johnny I became interested in his story i.e. his conversion from the head of the KKK in the US, to being a Christian Minister who now teaches against race hate groups. I found the article <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Lee_Clary_510a.html" title="Johnny Lee Clary">Johnny Lee Clary</a> as it still is today, deleted, except for some small talk. If you read the talk you see what I have said at the time (notice I have gotten no reply, probable my fault as I don’t know heaps about WIKI policy). From my understanding Johnny Lee Clary was posting as The KingOfDixie and looks like he tried to change a few things on Wiki concerning the KKK. While this is a controversial subject, Johnny being the former leader of the KKK would probably know a thing or two and be able to contibute, but that’s another story. He eventually made an article about himself i.e. Johnny Lee Clary. Johnny being quite new to Wiki and ignorant of rules of conduct found himself at odds with some admins and had his site deleted.</p>
<p>Whilst observing Johnny over the last 3-4 months I have noticed that he is very outspoken against race hate groups such as the Neo Nazis, Skinheads, KKK etc. This, more often than not, lands Johnny in the hot seat. He has experienced persecution from racist groups for his departure from the KKK and voiced opinions against these racist organizations on his webpage, www.xkkk.org. Johnny has also received multiple death threats.</p>
<p>Because of his bold stance against these racist groups Johnny has become accustomed to hatred directed at him by those same groups. Johnny concluded that perhaps the guy who deleted the page <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Lee_Clary_510a.html" title="Johnny Lee Clary">Johnny Lee Clary</a> was a white supremist. I am hoping to clear this up. Before he told me this, I started to create J L Clary, after hearing nothing from posting in user talk on Johnny Lee Clary's article. I wasn't 10 minutes into the J L Clary article when it was issued a deletion notice, and then before I had time to reply (about 5 minutes) it was deleted! I was amazed. I told this to Johnny and he said the main reason he was told that he couldn't have an article was because he was not prominent enough.</p>
<p>Johnny has a very famous testimony and has been on multiple TV shows like Oprah, Donahue, Jerry Springer, etc, and even recently when he preached in our town he made front page news, a double spread on his life, and the local ABC interviewed him live, which is not bad for our town (LISMORE NSW Australia) See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Kerry&amp;dir=prev&amp;offset=20050327125109&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Kerry&amp;dir=prev&amp;offset=20050327125109&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Kerry&amp;dir=prev&amp;offset=20050327125109&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history</a> .</p>
<p>When <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Wilkerson_154c.html" title="David Wilkerson">David Wilkerson</a> came to our town hardly anyone knew or cared, yet <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Wilkerson_154c.html" title="David Wilkerson">David Wilkerson</a> is allowed an article (and rightfully so), but more people know of Johnny. As to whether he is famous or not, just Google search him and see all the TV interviews and radio interviews he does. He hangs with some of the most prominent Christian leaders in Australia. Besides this, just being the former KKK leader should be enough for an article (he doesn't even get a mention in the KKK one, and would be deleted). He was also a Pro Wrestler. So he is prominent in Christian circles, he is prominent amongst race hate groups, and he is also prominent in the WWE wrestling.</p>
<p>Johnny asked me to test the waters for him to see if he was being persecuted by someone from a race hate group. So I created some sites, John Clary <a href="../../../w/a/d/Wade_Watts_9977.html" title="Wade Watts">Wade Watts</a> and Operation Colorblind - the name of Johnny's Ministry. These have been fine until yesterday. I cannot understand why these sites are just issued a deletion notice? Just because they mention JLC? I was hoping to discuss these things but they are just deleted. The one on Wade Watts is about a black gospel preacher who was one of the leaders in the civil rights movement in the US and was good friends with Martin Luther King. He took Johnny Clary under his wing and even ordained Johnny as a minister (to this day Johnny is the only white man ordained in the All Black Baptist Church). But his article is up for deletion because I mentioned Clary and had a link.</p>
<p>That is why I am writing to you to see if you can help. It seems to me that the person(s) deleting all articles which even mention Johnny Lee Clary has an agenda. I thought that wikipedia admins had to keep a neutral stance on every article. It seems like this guy has a vendetta against JLC. Why delete the Wade Watts article. That is guilt by association and could be proof that all deletions are because of racial discrimination! I hope this is not the case and would think that it is politically motivated, as Johnny is a strong supporter of George Bush and Antaeus Feldspar of Kerry.</p>
<p>See:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Kerry&amp;dir=prev&amp;offset=20050327125109&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Kerry&amp;dir=prev&amp;offset=20050327125109&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Kerry&amp;dir=prev&amp;offset=20050327125109&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history</a> This shows how Antaeus Feldspar supports Kerry, which is fine, but Johnny is a strong supporter of Bush.</p>
<p>My hope is that Johnny will be able to have an article like any other famous person, minister, former KKK leader, or pro wrestler, and that Johnny and anyone connected with him and his ministry will in future have certain rules set in place that do not allow the wholesale deletion of the articles associated with him, but that they will be at least discussed.</p>
<p>I thank you for reading this long winded post. I have only been using WIKI for about a year myself so I need your help, I don't really know what else to do. I hope you can help. I personally think that Johnny's story is one that is beneficial to the cause of reconciliation between races and to the3 unity of society as a whole. It would be a shame if WIKI became known for having covert racists. Of course I hope that this is a misunderstanding and that all will be cleared up soon.</p>

<p>Hi there, Angela.</p>

Apparently, his request at Meta was redirected to our admins (me included). Correct me if I'm wrong but none of us at ka have the privilege to set bot status for a user.</p>
<p>Therefore, could you grant him the bot status? Or in case I can do it myself, tell me where I can find the option?</p>

<dd>There seems to be a little miscommunication about this, partly may fault: I only made a request at ka-wiki, where I got approval, and they would notify the necessary persons. At that point, I believed they had a local bureaucrat, which they apparently have not. I now made a regualar request at meta, and normally it should follow normal procedures there. Thanks anyway&#160;:-) --<a href="../../../t/u/v/User%7ETuvic_e68d.html" title="User:Tuvic">Tuvic</a> 16:14, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Somehow I've managed to end up with two accounts. Is it possile to merge them? The accounts are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Urbanterrorist</li>
<li>UrbanTerrorist - this is the one I use</li>
</ul>
<p>As to how I ended up with two - I know at one point I coudn't access my account, assumed it had either been deleted, or I'd forgotten what it was, and set up the second, which is the one I use all the time. The other has some history that I'd like to keep. I could just manually copy over the watch pages I guess - but thought I'd ask.</p>
<p>I just found out tonight how to get back into the old one, by accident (type in other words).</p>

<p>Hello, I was reading the WikiSym interview at <a href="http://www.riehle.org/computer-science/research/2006/wikisym-2006-interview.html" class="external free" title="http://www.riehle.org/computer-science/research/2006/wikisym-2006-interview.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.riehle.org/computer-science/research/2006/wikisym-2006-interview.html</a>, and I had a small idea after reading, "Another challenge is dealing with people who are portrayed in a Wikipedia biography and are unhappy—justified or unjustified—about something. This already consumes a lot of the time of the help desk and my impression is that there will be more and more cases.". Wondering what you think, since you have been helping people with this issue. I posted it here:</p>

<p>Hi Angela, thank you for your input yesterday on my policy proposal. I wanted to specifically exclude Board members, Stewards, Devs, ArbCom, and other higher level positions from it, or to be more cautious in the approach for those--would you recommend I change "board approval" for, for example, ArbCom members to be reviewed by perhaps ArbCom itself for Recall votes for those members? <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/o/User_talk%7ERootology_22b0.html" title="User talk:Rootology">T</a>) 20:18, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Regularly, ads icons are inserted in front of external links, that make it look like Wikipedia treats them special, promoting or endorsing those sites. This gets worse now with the templates used for external links to IMDb, MusicBrainz, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../m/u/s/Image%7EMusicBrainz_Album_Icon.png_101e.html" class="image" title="MusicBrainz spam icon"><img src="../../../upload/shared/1/1d/MusicBrainz_Album_Icon.png" alt="MusicBrainz spam icon" width="16" height="16" longdesc="../../../m/u/s/Image%7EMusicBrainz_Album_Icon.png_101e.html" /></a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:MusicBrainz_album&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=41410972" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:MusicBrainz_album&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=41410972" rel="nofollow">Diff of the latest insertion of an icon ad in the template for MusicBrainz external links</a></li>
<li>Last.fm spam icon (fair use) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Lastfm.gif" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Lastfm.gif" rel="nofollow">This external links icon ad for Last.fm</a> keeps popping up right and left.</li>
</ul>
<p>We really could use a specific, explicit point of policy against this (and a direct WP:ICONAD or WP:SPAMICON or something), that could be immediately cited in the edit summary for removing or reverting this spam without long discussions with each "new user" doing the spamming for those sites. We could also mention it in bold as a NoInclude warning in the related templates, so as to remove plausible denial to future offenders.</p>

<dl>
<dd>It's not really spam since it's not those sites adding them. There's already a policy about fair use images in templates, so that should cover it without the need for a policy specifically about icons. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a></dd>

Wikipedia is not very user friendly for people like me with too many policies all over the place, and I am afraid that my way of communicating will not be appreciated by beurrocrats.

<p>Hello Angela, many compliments for your user page! I am here to pose you a technical question about the incubator: I gave a helping hand to Test Emilian wikipedia [http:incubator.wikimedia.org/wiki/test-wp/eml], by copying and pasting some templates from <a href="../../../../lmo/p/a/g/pagina_prin%C3%A7ipala_0557.html" class="extiw" title="lmo:pagina_prinçipala">Lombard wikipedia</a>, where I am mostly active. Now I wonder if templates should be placed as subpages of test-wp/eml or not. So far I made up this:</p>
<ul>
<li>[http:incubator.wikimedia.org/wiki/template:PIA]. But, maybe, I should have done this:</li>
<li>[http:incubator.wikimedia.org/wiki/test-wp/eml/template:PIA].</li>
</ul>

<p>Hi, I came across this: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ck_lostsword#AWB_edits" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ck_lostsword#AWB_edits" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ck_lostsword#AWB_edits</a> and I think you are mistaken. Usual UK spelling is 'publicly', though <b>some</b> online resources list the -ally version as a variant. I would argue that correcting -ally to -ly is a good edit. The Wictionary link you give isn't active; maybe they have corrected it? Anyway, sorry to bother you but I am interested in this sort of thing. --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 23:28, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
