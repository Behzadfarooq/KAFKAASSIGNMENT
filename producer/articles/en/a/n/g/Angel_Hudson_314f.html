<p><b>Angel Hudson</b> was a <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_character.html" title="Fictional character">fictional character</a> in the popular <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> <a href="../../../s/o/a/Soap_opera.html" title="Soap opera">soap opera</a> <i><a href="../../../e/a/s/EastEnders_4f21.html" title="EastEnders">EastEnders</a></i>. He was played by <a href="../../../g/o/l/Goldie.html" title="Goldie">Goldie</a>.</p>
<p>Angel, the gold-<a href="../../../t/e/e/Teeth.html" title="Teeth">toothed</a> <a href="../../../g/a/n/Gangster.html" title="Gangster">gangster</a>, was an old acquintance of <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Trueman_bd16.html" title="Paul Trueman">Paul Trueman</a>. Paul owed him a large amount of money and Angel wanted to cash in his debt.</p>
<p><a name="History" id="History"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/g/Angel_Hudson_314f.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Angel was first seen in June 2001 when he attended a <a href="../../../p/o/k/Poker.html" title="Poker">poker</a> game that <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Owen_a645.html" title="Steve Owen">Steve Owen</a> was holding. His appearance was a huge shock to one of the other gamblers, Paul Trueman, and it soon became clear that the two had unresolved issues. Later during a break from the game, Angel approached Paul and told him that he wanted what he was owed: <a href="../../../p/o/u/Pound_sterling.html" title="Pound sterling">£</a>30,000.00. He told Paul that he had a week to pay up or he would make sure he disappeared for good!</p>
<p>Paul desperately tried to get the money together by stealing property from his mother, <a href="../../../a/u/d/Audrey_Trueman_ffe5.html" title="Audrey Trueman">Audrey Trueman</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/w/Pawnbroker.html" title="Pawnbroker">pawning</a> the goods and then gambling the money he was given. Inevitably, this failed and he ended up with less money than he began with. By the end of the week, Angel came to collect his money, and when Paul failed to pay, Angel gave him a severe beating and trashed his mother's <a href="../../../b/e/d/Bed_and_breakfast.html" title="Bed and breakfast">bed and breakfast</a>.</p>
<p>After more threats from Angel, Paul decided to <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackmail.html" title="Blackmail">blackmail</a> his brother, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Trueman_1bd9.html" title="Anthony Trueman">Anthony</a>, into giving him the money. Anthony was the local <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Practitioner_19ea.html" title="General Practitioner">GP</a>, a respectable man with a worthy profession, but he had a dark secret. When he was 15 years old, after a heavy drinking session, Anthony had driven a <a href="../../../c/a/r/Car.html" title="Car">car</a>, hit a pedestrian and then left the scene. Not wanting his brother to ruin his chance of a successful career, Paul had taken the blame for the crime and had subsequently served 18 months in <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prison.html" title="Prison">prison</a>. Paul threatened to tell their mother the truth unless Anthony gave him the money he needed. A fearful Anthony felt he had no choice but to oblige, so he took out a <a href="../../../l/o/a/Loan.html" title="Loan">loan</a> and Paul paid Angel what he owed him. Satisified, Angel left <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walford.html" title="Walford">Walford</a>, but told Paul they would meet again.</p>
<p>Angel returned in June 2002 with more orders for Paul. Angel had been accused of <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murder.html" title="Murder">murder</a> and was soon to stand <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trial.html" title="Trial">trial</a>. He was using his wife, <a href="../../../p/r/e/Precious_Hudson_d66f.html" title="Precious Hudson">Precious</a>, as a fake <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/alibi" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:alibi">alibi</a>, and he wanted Paul to guard her until she could testify. Paul had no choice but to oblige and so Precious moved into his home on <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Square_f1ed.html" title="Albert Square">Albert Square</a>. Paul was initially unaware that Precious was Angel's wife, so when she set about trying to seduce him, he had no qualms about taking her to bed. When he discovered the truth, he was petrified of what Angel would do if he found out about the affair. However, he soon had greater problems when Precious decided to do a runner, leaving Paul to face up to a furious Angel. Paul sped off to bring Precious back, whilst Angel held his father, <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Trueman_8433.html" title="Patrick Trueman">Patrick</a>, and his brother's girlfriend, <a href="../../../z/o/e/Zoe_Slater_5723.html" title="Zoe Slater">Zoe Slater</a>, hostage. Luckily, Paul managed to persuade Precious to return before Angel did any real harm. Their affair continued and it soon blossomed into <a href="../../../l/o/v/Love.html" title="Love">love</a>.</p>
<p>Later in the month, the family of the man that was killed by Angel tried to silence Precious by placing a <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bomb.html" title="Bomb">bomb</a> underneath her car. Luckily, no one was harmed, but a furious Precious told Angel that she'd had enough and would only provide his alibi in court if he promised to <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divorce.html" title="Divorce">divorce</a> her. Angel agreed, but days later Precious was <a href="../../../k/i/d/Kidnap.html" title="Kidnap">kidnapped</a> by the victim's family. They convinced her that Angel would never let her go and that the only way to get rid of him was to get him locked up. Precious agreed and at the trial she denied being with Angel at the time of the murder. Precious assumed that this would be enough to put Angel away for good, but was shocked to discover that he was found not guilty anyway.</p>
<p>Paul and Precious then decided to flee the country. However, Angel caught up with Precious before she could get away. He told her that her betrayal didn't bother him enough to kill her and he told her she could have her divorce on one condition — she was to stay away from Paul. If he ever found out she and Paul were together again, he promised that he would kill them both. Precious had no choice but to finish with Paul and leave Walford without him. Angel's last appearance was in July 2002.</p>
