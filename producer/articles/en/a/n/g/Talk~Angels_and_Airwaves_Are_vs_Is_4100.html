<p>Someone (an anonymous user?) kept editing this page to change "<b>Angels and Airwaves</b> are" to "<b>Angels and Airwaves</b> is". To my knowledge "<b>Angels and Airwaves</b> are" as a usage is correct because the band's name is plural and I cannot even imagine that it is correct to say "<b>Angels and Airwaves</b> is". Next time this page is reverted as "<b>Angels and Airwaves</b> are" to "<b>Angels and Airwaves</b> is", I am going to add dispute sign. For the last time, "<b>Angels and Airwaves</b> are" as a usage is correct because the band's name is plural and I am really getting tired of changing it. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_101_9f64.html" title="User:Alex 101">Alex 101</a> 20:49, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I'm not the guy who keeps changing it, but this has me pretty curious. I don't think it really makes a difference, they're probably both right. The first example I could think of off the top of my head is Mothers Against Drinking and Driving. MADD "is" a non-profit organization. Mothers Against Drinking and Driving "are" a non-profit organization. The first refers to the group as a single thing, the second refers to the people in the group. Both would probably be correct. In this case are we talking about the band or the people in the band? It's pretty much the same thing so I don't think it matters. I also just looked at what other people have written for the articles of other bands with these kind of names, some have "is", others have "are". Doesn't make a difference. --<a href="../../../z/2/0/User%7EZ2000_7228.html" title="User:Z2000">Z2000</a> 03:20, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure that people in the UK use "are" and people in the the USA use "is" for groups. So both and neither are correct, technically. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyale_171d.html" title="User:Crazyale">Crazyale</a> 00:01, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I really think it should be "is," not "are." Angels and Airwaves is not plural. It is a proper noun referring to a single entity, in this case a band, and therefore "is" should be used. Using a different word, like has, you can see the usage again. You would say "Angels and Airwaves has become quite popular among blink fans," not "Angels and Airwaves have become..." This same idea should be used with is/are in this context. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrewface_aaa6.html" title="User:Drewface">Drewface</a> 00:59, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's you think or your opinion, <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrewface_aaa6.html" title="User:Drewface">Drewface</a>, but, for sure "are" is right not "is". So leave it that way, you little vandal. The reason why "are" is right is because the word Angels is plural (as in more than one angel) and Airwaves (as in more than one airwave) is plural. Without the "s" it makes it singular (proper noun). Again, leave it like this: "Angels and Airwaves are", not "Angels and Airwaves is".

<dd>First off, I NEVER vandalized this site. Yes, the words angels and airwaves are plural within themself, but when they are used as the title of anything (could be a movie, band, book, magazine, persons name, etc), they are referring to a SINGLE entity. Think of something like "The Outsiders." (I'm referring to the movie here.) If you were talking about this movie, would you say "The Outsiders are a great movie?" NO. You would say "The Outsiders IS a great movie." Same concept applies for the name of this band. Angels and Airwaves IS the name of the band, and because it is the name of the band, the phrase, when used in this context, refers to a singular entity, and is therefore singular itself. I won't switch it to is right now, because you'll probably go and report me or something, but it really should be "is." <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrewface_aaa6.html" title="User:Drewface">Drewface</a> 17:07, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It should clearly be referenced as "Angels and Airwaves IS" as the sentence is only referring to the band as one entity. The plural form would only be put in place if the statement was referring to a group or collection of bands. In that case the plural form would be appropriate.

I think that both ways are proper in this case, but I think that this discussion is stupid, immature and full of shit. So, I just want to keep me hands out of this.

<blockquote>
<p>In British English, singular nouns that describe multiple people are often treated as plural, particularly where one is concerned with the people constituting the team, rather than with the team as an entity. The singular form is usually used in American."</p>

Good find, Mirv. According to what the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html#National_varieties_of_English" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">Wikipedia Manual of Style</a> has to say, I think American english (that means "is," not "are") should be used for this article. I think this because: 1. This is an American band based out of California, and 2. The rest of this article is written in American english If this was a British band, I'd vote to use "are." It seems that the majority of the people here are either for using "is" or don't care either way, so, once again, I say we go with "is." <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrewface_aaa6.html" title="User:Drewface">Drewface</a> 01:36, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank goodness someone is intelligent enough to use "is"—there are a few of us out there! Just because a band's name ends with "s" doesn't mean it's plural!

<p>I can't believe that this is an argument. Its simply UK vs US english. It's the same deal when refering to large companies. "Wendy's are based in .." vs "Wendy's is based in" UK refers to all the people in the company (are) while the US refers to it as a legal entity (is).

<p>You know to be quiet honest who realy cares about if its "<b>Angels and Airwaves</b> are" or if its "<b>Angels and Airwaves is</b>" the point is that this discussion page should not be about puntution or spelling or any bull$#it like that.The point is that it should be about releases and other headlined news not wastes of space like this.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The argument about "is" vs "are" has to do with making the article proper from a literary standpoint, which is part of what the talk page is here for: to give a place for people to discuss technicalities (spelling?) of the article. I do feel, however, that there is a lot in the above section that could be removed, and think that if someone could organize the opposing arguments in a cleaner layout it would be very helpful. Maybe I'll handle it sometime soon if there are no objections from anyone. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrewface_aaa6.html" title="User:Drewface">Drewface</a> 22:50, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
