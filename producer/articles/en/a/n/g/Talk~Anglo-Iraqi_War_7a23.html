<p>This page should not contain a one-sided view of the military treaty between the British and Iraq. Large parts of the world know how these treaties were negotiated and what they were for. Anyone who writes material about wars to uphold the sacred nature of British Treaties is creating nationalist nonsense material. They would have invaded with or without the military treaty. If anyone doesn't think so, look at the case of Iran. There was no treaty there and not any true legal justification at all. But the British not only went in with the USSR, they overthrew the government. Their actions can be justified reasonably by wartime necessity, but defending the military treaty and using it as a justification is wrong and has always played into the hands of nationalists.</p>
<p>That the British attacked first and deliberately without warning at the battle is well established historical fact. Its possible to argue a justification for their actions, but its not possible to pretend that it didn't happen that way. The Iraqi point of view must also at least be represented.</p>
<p>The strength of the British at the airbase has been consistantly misrepresented in British materials so as to make the defenders seem much more threatened than they actually were.</p>
<p>Its also silly to accept the offical British line that Iraq wasn't under military occupation during the war. When the British have large numbers of troops deployed across the entire country for years after there was any military need, that is military occupation. Most sources consider the occupation as lasting until October 26, 1947 when the all the troops aside from those at the airbases left. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 63.133.154.10 (<a href="../../../6/3/2E/User_talk%7E63.133.154.10.html" title="User talk:63.133.154.10">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_63.133.154.10_c1e4.html" title="Special:Contributions/63.133.154.10">contribs</a>) 16:56, 18 October 2005 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>I think that we both agree that the treaty was dictated by the British and was put in place to give them a at least the cover of a legal treaty to justify subsequent intervention in Iraq. I also agree that without it, the British would still have acted to protect their strategic and oil interests, as they did in Iran. That is what I am trying to say. Denying the existence of the treaty is nonsense. It existed regardless of its fairness or acceptance by iraqi nationalists.</dd>
<dd>To be surprised by an attack from a military force which you have threatened and made demands on seems to me to be either stupidity or arrogance. If you think the Iraqi forces were stupid by not expecting an attack then why not say so instead of complaining of British tactics? As for the weakness of the base's forces I have not challenged your assessment but tried to demonstrate the improvised nature of some of the defences.</dd>
<dd>I have tried to suggest that the British forces stayed in the country to maintain control, but they did this by supporting the pro-British government (and maybe by dictating policies) not by a formal military occupation with a British ruler. Unlike German occupied territories in Western Europe, nominally at least, the Iraqi monarchists were the government not a British military governor. <a href="../../../d/a/b/User%7EDabbler_9770.html" title="User:Dabbler">Dabbler</a> 17:30, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>- I dont think the intent is to deny the existance of the treaty, but to put sufficient language in to avoid the old problem of the British covering over their real intentions by using the sanctity of treaties.</p>
<p>- It is nonsense to claim that the British were not in military occupation of Iraq. They appointed "Town Majors" every town of signficance in the country including Baghdad, Kut, Habbaniya, Mussaiyib, Mosul... Every town had a military garrison watching over it. The troops in Iraq were deployed to control the entire country, not to guard any particular area like the oilfields.</p>
<p>- The fact that needs to be presented is that the British fired first. There were a whole series of provocations on both sides leading to the opening of hostilities which was by the British. When the British landed at Basra without permission, the Iraqis did not open fire. And I'm certain that if they had, they would find themselves denounced as aggressors for having opened fire first. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../1/5/2/User%7E152.163.100.13.html" title="User:152.163.100.13">152.163.100.13</a> (<a href="../../../1/5/2/User_talk%7E152.163.100.13.html" title="User talk:152.163.100.13">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_152.163.100.13_ecf1.html" title="Special:Contributions/152.163.100.13">contribs</a>) 20:48, 23 October 2005 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>The treaty issue is well covered in the article's current incarnation, it is obvious that it was imposed and used as a figleaf.</dd>
<dd>There was fighting between Iraqis and the British Indian troops landed in Basra. No one is demeaning the Iraqis for being aggressors, but I believe that you are demeaning the Iraqi forces by this insistence that they were too stupid to realise that the British might attack them if they threatened their base at Habbaniya. I am curious why you have such a low opinion of the Iraqis?<a href="../../../d/a/b/User%7EDabbler_9770.html" title="User:Dabbler">Dabbler</a> 11:49, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I can't tell from the article where the initial battle took place, Basra or Habbaniya? The text says "twelve days after the initial British landings in Basra, the Iraqi Army established itself on the high ground to the south of the base." Which seems to indicate the basra base, but later text made me think Habbaiya. Could somebody who knows please mod the above quote to make it clear.

<dd>Excellent question. I think it should be included in the general framework and not treated seperately. The Iraqis wanted German assistance and support - and got it. 129.69.160.219 16:00, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

An elaborate plan was created and carried out without a loss. Iraqi resistance was non-existent. With the town in British hands, the attacking force was dispersed elsewhere. The British did not think the Iraqis would counterattack. On May 22, in the early morning, the Iraqi 6th Brigade\3rd Division (800 men) with CV33 tankettes attacked. Iraqi artillery pulverized the two British companies holding the town in their trenches surrounding it. They were forced to pull back into the town. The three Iraqi battalions with tanks were as good as the British by accounts in combat but for one thing: steady morale. From 3 a.m. to 10 a.m., the two British companies held but were nearing their end in this urban type combat. Luckily, the Luftwaffe had failed to support this attack (although they did the following day!). At 10 a.m., the tables began to turn when two additional British companies arrived. The battle did not stop but raged onward until the Iraqis gave up at 6 p.m. The road to Baghdad was now open. It had been a near thing! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.82.226.40 (<a href="../../../7/0/2E/User_talk%7E70.82.226.40.html" title="User talk:70.82.226.40">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.82.226.40_b03a.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.82.226.40">contribs</a>) 01:32, 17 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>If the above is correct, it should be added into the article. Are there any references for German and Italian military involvement? What were their numbers? <a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolks_at_137_5f34.html" title="User:Folks at 137">Folks at 137</a> 21:22, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
