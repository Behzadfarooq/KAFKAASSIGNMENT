<p>I see that <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Church_593a.html" title="High Church">High Church</a> is simply a redirect to this page. Not my religion, and I don't claim expertise, but I've always been under the impression that, while Anglo-Catholics are necessarily High Church, one can be High Church without being an Anglo-Catholic. Can someone with more expertise clarify?</p>
<p>The Oxford Movement which ave birth to Anglo-Catholicism itself grew out of the High Church movement, which pre-dated it. They were conservative in politics and against emotion in worship, hence gaining the name "High and Dry." Indeed many High Churchmen were appalled at the enthusiasm shown by the young Tractarians, Newman and Froude. Of course the High Church article now links to the High church article. <a href="../../../m/n/j/User%7EMnJWalker_e36e.html" title="User:MnJWalker">MnJWalker</a></p>

<p>Okay, the contention is that Anglo-Catholic Central is too exclusive to the conservative, <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forward_in_Faith_0810.html" title="Forward in Faith">Forward in Faith</a>-style of Anglo-Catholicism. However, I put the link there in the first place, and I am definitely of the <a href="../../../a/f/f/Affirming_Catholicism_c248.html" title="Affirming Catholicism">Affirming Catholicism</a> school of Anglicanism. The reason for the link was that a number of people were cluttering the External links with hyperlinks to skillions of different individual Anglo-Catholic parishes, and ACC provides, to my knowledge, the most comprehensive directory. So basically, instead of having links to fifteen different parishes, we could link to one directory of many more than that. The reasoning for this was elucidated in the conversation above between myself and <a href="../../../e/c/o/User%7EEconomistUK_4282.html" title="User:EconomistUK">EconomistUK</a>, under the heading "Links". Please discuss. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarolynparrishfan_61da.html" title="User:Carolynparrishfan">Carolynparrishfan</a> 13:24, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't know why or why not Anglo-Catholic Central lists or does not list certain parishes that are in the Anglo-Catholic tradition, but I think a more genuine link would be one that lists all Anglo-Catholic parishes. To me, it would be the Anglican thing to do. I have seen other posts in Wikipedia with numerous links, with no custodian cleaning things up for them. I suppose that we who, like the ECUSA and the Anglican Church in Canada, are welcome to come but are told to be quiet just have to do so. I hope that people who go to the parishes allowed to be named in Anglo-Catholic Central will some day visit my parish, one not deemed worthy to be named, yet focused on the Lord's vision of justice, and joyfully Anglo-Catholic <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThurifer_93f8.html" title="User:Thurifer">Thurifer</a> 19:54 12 Dec 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not really. The Anglican Catholic Church is a denomination which formed in protest to the ordination of women in the Episcopal Church/Anglican Communion. Anglo-Catholicism is a movement with a primarily liturgical and theological focus; there are many Anglo-Catholics and Anglo-Catholic parishes within the Anglican and Episcopal Churches, who do not support further schism. In addition, many Anglo-Catholic churches are quite politically liberal; I attend an Anglo-Catholic church with several female priests and a Gay Christians Reading Group, neither of which (I think) would be welcome in an Anglican Catholic parish. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 22:37, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article presently says "Anglicans share with Roman Catholics a belief in the sacramental nature of the priesthood, the sacrificial character of the Mass, and the Real Presence in the Eucharist, but Anglo-Catholics lay great stress on these points to counter the tendency of Evangelicals to try to promote ideas such as lay presidency at the Eucharist".</p>
<p>This is misleading and wrong. The belief in the sacrifice of the Mass is not a belief of middle-of-the-road Anglicanism. The belief is specifically denied in the 39 articles and was unknown in Anglicanism until the Oxford Movement - Newman writes in his "Apologia" of a well-meaning typical Anglican who wrote a letter to correct Newman's use of the phrase "Sacrifice of the Eucharist" in a tract, which he assumed must have been a printing error in place of "Sacrament of the Eucharist". As for the sacramental priesthood and the Real Presence (in any Catholic sense), one cannot say that these are accepted Anglican teachings. The large Evangelical party in the Anglican church has never accepted either of them (and indeed the original reformers reduced the sacraments to two (Baptism and the Lord's Supper) on the model of the Continental Reformation). I am a Roman Catholic from Sydney and you would be hard-pressed to find an Anglican here in this Low church city who would believe any of these things. The article gives a false impression by presenting these doctrines as ordinary Anglican doctrines which the Anglo-Catholics merely put more emphasis on - rather, in large part they are doctrines held <i>only</i> by the Anglo-Catholic party in the Anglican church. This seems to me rather obvious bias to prop up the Anglo-Catholic position that the Church of England can be considered a branch of the Catholic Church (justifying their own existence within it) rather than as essentially Protestant.

<p>This states that "A minority of Anglo-Catholics (sometimes called Anglo-Papalists) consider themselves under Papal supremacy.." and that "A significant portion of Britain's present Roman Catholics are former Anglicans or their descendants." I do not think that the second sentence is meaningful or belongs with the first. A significant portion of Roman Catholics in Britain will descended from former Anglicans but whether those former Anglicans were originally Anglo Papalists is questionable. The paragraph seems to suggest that the Catholic church in England contains a large number of people who were, or whose familise were, originally Anglo-Papalists. This seems unlikely. Is there a citation for this?</p>
<p>Unless there are any objections, I am goint to remove this sentence. Glow worm64 19:03, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
