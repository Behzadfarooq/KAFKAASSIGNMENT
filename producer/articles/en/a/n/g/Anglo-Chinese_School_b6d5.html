<p>The <b>Anglo-Chinese School</b> (<b>ACS</b>; <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simplified_Chinese_5a6f.html" title="Simplified Chinese">Chinese</a>: 英华学校) is a family of six <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodist.html" title="Methodist">Methodist</a> schools in <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore.html" title="Singapore">Singapore</a> and one in <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indonesia.html" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>. In Singapore, the family consists of <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Chinese_School_%28Junior%29_32d7.html" title="Anglo-Chinese School (Junior)">Anglo-Chinese School (Junior)</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Chinese_School_%28Primary%29_ab24.html" title="Anglo-Chinese School (Primary)">Anglo-Chinese School (Primary)</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Chinese_School_%28Independent%29_add7.html" title="Anglo-Chinese School (Independent)">Anglo-Chinese School (Independent)</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Chinese_School_%28Barker_Road%29_ef59.html" title="Anglo-Chinese School (Barker Road)">Anglo-Chinese School (Barker Road)</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Chinese_School_%28International%29_Singapore_a00f.html" title="Anglo-Chinese School (International) Singapore">Anglo-Chinese School (International) Singapore</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Chinese_Junior_College_8563.html" title="Anglo-Chinese Junior College">Anglo-Chinese Junior College</a>. In Indonesia, ACS is represented by <a href="../../../s/t/b/STB-ACS_%28International%29_Jakarta_e7b4.html" title="STB-ACS (International) Jakarta">STB-ACS (International) Jakarta</a>.</p>
<p>The ACS family of schools have traditionally been single-gender schools that admit only male students. However, with the changing times, four schools - <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Chinese_Junior_College_8563.html" title="Anglo-Chinese Junior College">Anglo-Chinese Junior College</a>, ACS (Independent), ACS (International) and STB-ACS (International) Jakarta - have also begun admitting female students.</p>
<p>The school is also affiliated with other Methodist schools in Singapore, including <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodist_Girls%27_School_5b53.html" title="Methodist Girls' School">Methodist Girls' School</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/y/Paya_Lebar_Methodist_Girls%27_School_8df7.html" title="Paya Lebar Methodist Girls' School">Paya Lebar Methodist Girls' School</a> (all-girls institutions), Geylang Methodist Secondary School and Fairfield Methodist Secondary School (co-educational). The name is usually abbreviated as "ACS", with the junior college as "ACJC", and its students and alumni referred to as "ACSians" (pronounced ack-sians), or "ACS boys" (and girls, for ACJC, ACS (Independent) IB Programme and ACS (International)).</p>
<p>ACS has also become the first school in Singapore to have a flower named after it, the Ascocenda Anglo-Chinese School <a href="../../../o/r/c/Orchid.html" title="Orchid">orchid</a>, a hybrid created by the school to mark its 116<sup>th</sup> Founder's Day on 1 March <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>. <a href="http://www.acjc.edu.sg/AscocendaACS/AscocendaACS.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.acjc.edu.sg/AscocendaACS/AscocendaACS.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<p>ACS was founded on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_1.html" title="March 1">March 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/8/1886.html" title="1886">1886</a> by Bishop William Fitzjames Oldham, as an extension of the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodist_Church_51da.html" title="Methodist Church">Methodist Church</a>. Its first location was a dilapidated shophouse at 70 <a href="../../../a/m/o/Amoy_Street_97e1.html" title="Amoy Street">Amoy Street</a> with a total of 13 pupils. The name of the school came from the fact that it conducted lessons in English in the mornings and Chinese in the afternoons. By the following year, enrollment had increased to 104, and the school moved to Coleman Street. Within the next three years, its student population increased to 300.</p>
<p>Almost ten years after the founding of the Methodist Mission in Singapore, on 31st July 1895, a young Englishman, the Rev. E. Horley arrive in Ipoh and founded ACS Ipoh.</p>
<p><br />
Between <a href="../../../1/9/1/1914.html" title="1914">1914</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920.html" title="1920">1920</a>, under the leadership of the Reverend J S Nagle, the school introduced regular religious (or "chapel") services and <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physical_education.html" title="Physical education">physical education</a> classes. Afternoon classes were also established for academically-weaker pupils. In a bid to ensure continuity in school life and keep the school adequately staffed, Nagel encouraged ex-students, known as old boys, to return to the school as teachers. To this day, the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Chinese_School_Old_Boys%27_Association_c0f2.html" title="Anglo-Chinese School Old Boys' Association">Anglo-Chinese School Old Boys' Association</a> is a link through which many old boys continue to keep close ties to the school. The Anglo-Chinese Continuation School was started by the new principal, the Reverend P L Peach, in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1925.html" title="1925">1925</a>, for students who had to leave the school due to the newly imposed age limits on school-going boys by the government. Eventually, ACS was renamed the Oldham Methodist School. A <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secondary_School_7ce2.html" title="Secondary School">Secondary School</a> was opened at Cairnhill.</p>
<p>Between <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>, the <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japanese</a> occupied Singapore during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>. During the Occupation, lessons were suspended, and the school only re-opened its doors in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a>, a year after the Japanese surrender and once the buildings at Cairnhill and Coleman Street were made safe from damage sustained during the war. The pre-war principal, T W Hinch, who had been interned by the Japanese during the Occupation and had been sent back to <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> to recover, returned to the school in June. Among his first priorities was to set up "X" and "Y" classes, each with different levels of difficulty, for students who had missed years of their education due to the Occupation. In September, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950.html" title="1950">1950</a>, the Secondary School relocated from Cairnhill to Barker Road.</p>
<p>Also in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950.html" title="1950">1950</a>, Post School Certificate Classes, later known as Pre-University Classes because they were supposed to prepare students for <a href="../../../t/e/r/Tertiary_education.html" title="Tertiary education">tertiary education</a>, were set up, and the first batch of girl students were enrolled in ACS. However, students in the lower grades continued to be all male, a practice which persists to this day. Dr Thio Chan Bee, the first Asian principal of ACS, took the reins in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1952.html" title="1952">1952</a>. During his tenure, both the Cairnhill and Barker Road premises saw expansion, the latter with the building of the Lee Hall, a three-storey building housing 12 classrooms and 4 laboratories.</p>
<p>In January, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a>, the Oldham Methodist Secondary School merged with the Secondary School at Barker Road. The school completed the construction of the sports complex at Barker Road in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a>, with an Olympic-sized swimming pool (a first in a <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore.html" title="Singapore">Singapore</a> school) and a sports hall. In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a>, the Pre-University classes moved to the newly constructed Anglo-Chinese Junior College at 25 Dover Close East , off North Buona Vista Road, leaving the Barker Road site to the Secondary and Junior schools. The Junior School eventually relocated to new premises in its old neighborhood at Cairnhill, in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>, ACS celebrated its <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centennial.html" title="Centennial">centenary</a> with the publication of a hardback history of the school detailing its rich student and teacher life over the years, titled, <i>Hearts, Hopes and Aims</i>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a> saw another reorganization of the school. The Ministry of Education started its Independent School program that year. Independent schools are allowed to be privately funded and subject to less government regulation in setting out their curriculum. The school was renamed ACS (Independent); in 1993 the Barker Road campus was vacated and the school moved to Dover Road. After strong lobbying by alumni, the Barker Road site was retained for a second secondary school. At the same time, Anglo-Chinese <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_school.html" title="Primary school">Primary School</a> abandoned Coleman Street (the old building now housing the government National Archives) to share premises with the new Secondary School at Barker Road, now named ACS (Barker Road).</p>
<p>The Barker Road campus was completely rebuilt in the late <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>, with ACS (Barker Road) temporarily relocating during the project and ultimately split into primary and secondary school sections, the latter retaining the Barker Road suffix and the former becoming ACS (Primary). On <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_4.html" title="December 4">4 December</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, the two schools, ACS Oldham Hall, the Methodist Church in Singapore and the Barker Road Methodist Church moved back to the newly built campus at Barker Road with a state-of-the-art arts centre, a sports complex, church building with, Methodist centre building and ACS Oldham Hall building, all new. It was officially opened by Deputy Prime Minister <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Tan_Keng_Yam_6cc0.html" title="Tony Tan Keng Yam">Dr Tony Tan</a> on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_15.html" title="July 15">July 15</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>.</p>
<p>In January <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, ACS (International) was officially opened to the public. A completely private school, it recruits students both from Singapore and other countries. Its students will take the International General Certificate of Secondary Education in their fourth year, then go on to take a two-year <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Baccalaureate_b6c1.html" title="International Baccalaureate">International Baccalaureate</a> diploma from <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>. Before 2007, they will take the International <a href="../../../a/-/l/A-Level_2c81.html" title="A-Level">A-Levels</a>. ACS(I) has been officially authorised by the International Baccalaureate Organisation to offer the IB Diploma Programme commencing in January <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>. and is recognised as an IB World School.</p>
<p>ACS (Jakarta) formally joined the ACS family in July <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>. It is a co-ed IB School for students from Grades 1 to 12. It offers the IB Primary Years Programme (PYP) to Grades 1 to 6 and the Middle Years Programme (MYP) for students in Grades 7 to 9. It is the first school in Indonesia to be authorised for the PYP and the second for the MYP. At Grade 10, students sit for the IGCSE and students in Grade 12 either sit for the International A Level examinations or the IB Diploma.</p>
<p>Today there are seven schools under the Anglo-Chinese School umbrella. ACS (Junior) and ACS (Primary) are the primary schools while ACS (Barker Road), ACS (Independent), ACS (International) and ACJC provide secondary and <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-secondary_education.html" title="Post-secondary education">post-secondary education</a>. ACS (Jakarta) is the first unit outside of Singapore offering classes to boys and girls from Grades 1 to 12.</p>
<p>When Bishop Oldham started the school in 1886, he also took in some students as boarders. That boarding facility soon expanded and moved into larger and larger houses. First into Bellevue at Oldham Lane, then to Dunearn House at Barker Road. In 1986, when ACS celebrated its centenial year, the boarding school known as Oldham Hall moved into new premises within the ACS Barker Road campus. It moved back into the rebuilt premises in December 2002 and was renamed ACS Oldham Hall to emphasise its roots as a strong and vibrant member of the ACS family.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Chinese_School_b6d5.html" title="Edit section: Aims, characteristics, and reputation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Aims, characteristics, and reputation</span></h2>
<p>The school's stated philosophy is "To create conditions for students to embody excellence, to establish an environment for spiritual, intellectual and physical growth, to prepare pupils to meet the challenge of rapid change in society". This is reflected in the school motto, "The Best Is Yet To Be." The phrase is taken from the first line of the <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Browning_8d53.html" title="Robert Browning">Robert Browning</a> poem, <i>Rabbi ben Ezra</i> (<a href="../../../1/8/6/1864.html" title="1864">1864</a>), <i>"Grow old along with me! / The best is yet to be..."</i>.</p>
<p>ACS is considered one of the more prestigious schools in Singapore. This is because of its long history and also because many of its graduates have gone on to be successful in business as well as professional fields such as law and medicine. Although morally conservative due to its religious roots, the school has a reputation for producing students with strong background in English. The literary, debating and drama societies are particularly well-supported.</p>
<p>The school's students have often been stereotyped as of being arrogant and snobbish, and ACS itself has often been charged as being a school only for children of the <a href="../../../w/e/a/Wealth.html" title="Wealth">rich</a> and well-off. In the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a>, there was a minor flap in the local press about ACS students flaunting their wealth to other less privileged students and the world at large, and the term "<a href="../../../s/n/o/Snob.html" title="Snob">snob</a>" began being applied to them. As a result, the school initiated strict policies on how much money a student was allowed to bring to school, and even what kinds of watches or shoes would be permitted as part of the school attire, although such restrictions have been relaxed in recent times.</p>
<p><a name="School_Anthem_and_Crest" id="School_Anthem_and_Crest"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Chinese_School_b6d5.html" title="Edit section: School Anthem and Crest">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">School Anthem and Crest</span></h2>
<p>The school's anthem was written by teacher Henry Martyn Hoisington in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1926.html" title="1926">1926</a>. It is adapted from the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canadian</a> unofficial National Anthem, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Maple_Leaf_Forever_b633.html" title="The Maple Leaf Forever">The Maple Leaf Forever</a></i> and has served over the years as a means of bonding between students and alumni, evoking as it does memories of attending the institution.</p>
<p>These are the lyrics of the school anthem:</p>
<p>In days of yore from Western Shores<br />
Oldham dauntless hero came<br />
And planted a beacon of Truth and Light<br />
In this Island of the Main<br /></p>
<p>Here may it stand from year to year<br />
Emblem of grand endeavour<br />
The regions round echo the sound<br />
Of ACS forever!<br /></p>
<p>(chorus)<br />
Sing ACS forever more,<br />
Our ACS forever.<br />
God save our land and heaven bless<br />
Our ACS forever.<br /></p>
<p>Our students hail from China's Plains<br />
And the Land of Rising Sun<br />
We have many sons from India's Strand<br />
And the Islands of the Main<br /></p>
<p>Our hearts our hopes our aims are one<br />
No discord e'er will sever.<br />
We'll stand together for the cause<br />
Of ACS forever!<br />
