<p>Thanks for the information. I was not sure where I was supposed to post information regarding this type of issue.

<p>Thanks for the message, Angela. The reason I contacted you is that I have considerable respect for your ability and neutrality and think an outsider's observation on the article, particularly one of your calibre, would be invaluable. I understand and respect your decision totally, but I would urge you to think again. lol <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 04:34, 27 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is it time to bring back the conversation about allowing only folks with M number of edits and N days of existence to vote in VfD?

<p>Perhaps we should use this time also to introduce 5 days instead of 7, as the vote went? <a href="../../../f/u/z/User%7EFuzheado_f8f0.html" title="User:Fuzheado">Fuzheado</a> 07:37, 28 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Angela; Thank you for the mergering the Gia pages. For someone who has been accused of <i>vandalism</i> you sure are an angel!</p>
<p>I also wanted to say you live in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, I wanna go there badly, its a dream of mine to visit England someday. I have never been there but I know about aviation a lot so, what can I say, I love London Heathrow and Manchester airports, the only thing is Heathrow doesnt have my favorite airline, <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delta_Air_Lines_1541.html" title="Delta Air Lines">Delta</a>, Delta uses Gatwick. England to me seems like one of the mpst beautiful places in the world. I see why Madonna lives there and not here!!</p>
<p>Well, thats it for now. Thanks and <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> bless you!</p>

<p>There was never any danger that I was gone for good. The danger is that my Ph.D. supervisor may find out that I spent a month and a half editing Wikipedia for 8 hours a day instead of doing research. Oy. I think I've managed to break that habit, anyway. -- <a href="../../../c/y/a/User%7ECyan_b70d.html" title="User:Cyan">Cyan</a> 22:51, 28 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Angela, I'm sorry to drop this here but I really don't know what to do in situations like this. I respect you and the work you do highly, which is why I'm leaving a note here. I'm in a little tussle (perhaps it's over now) with <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexandros_406d.html" title="User:Alexandros">Alexandros</a> over <a href="../../../m/o/t/Mother_Teresa_71c4.html" title="Mother Teresa">Mother Teresa</a>. I think you and I both have successfully avoided the scrap that's built there between Eloquence and Jtdirl (and many others), so I'm hoping you can provide me with a neutral perspective. Do you mind looking at Mother Teresa's page history and the note I left at <a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexandros_41ca.html" title="User talk:Alexandros">User talk:Alexandros</a>? I'm still a little nervous as a sysop, and don't want to abuse my power, but I think what Alexander did today was really a harsh violation of Wikiquette, and I hate positions like this, where I want to know if I acted properly and if I should note Alexandros' actions, for example, on <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProblem_users_555a.html" title="Wikipedia:Problem users">Wikipedia:Problem users</a>, or if that would be too harsh. If you've no time, I certainly understand. If you do, though, I would appreciate your perspective on things very much. Thanks for all you do here!

<p>Hello, Since you seem to be an admin please check <a href="../../../g/d/a/Gdansk.html" title="Gdansk">Gdansk</a> and see my reasoning of removing the boldface from Danzig.

<p>Hi Angela, and thanks for taking care of the VfD entry of the <i>Criticisms</i> page, I was wondering how this should be handled, it's a new horizon for me and the deletion policy page didn't make it obvious IMO.

<p>Hi Angela, Thanks for smoothing out that earlier matter on <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProblem_users_555a.html" title="Wikipedia:Problem users">you-know-where</a>. I've decided to be more circumspect about listing people there (only genuine <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vandal.html" title="Vandal">Vandals</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visigoth.html" title="Visigoth">Visigoths</a> ;-)).</p>
<p>Normally, I try not to read other peoples' mail (!), but my eye caught the exchange above with Jwrosenzweig. I had a similar experience yesterday; made some dramatic deletions to <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialism.html" title="Socialism">Socialism</a> <i>twice</i> (which I restored <i>twice</i>). He is very new and very young (16) and has absolutely no sense of his own limitations (he described the Socialism article on his Talk page as "shockingly ignorant". (Yikes!) I am trying to rein him in a bit and get him onto the True Path (!) but I am not sure how successful I am being. In any case, I reviewed what Jwrosenzweig wrote to Alexandros and posted a similar message to I know we exort people to Be bold in updating pages but I want add a qualifier: <i>But-not-to-long-articles-on-complex,-controversial-subjects-with-many-contributors-and-long-histories.</i> Whew, what a mouthful!</p>

<p>Hi Angela, I posted this on Village Punp earlier but have had no direct response. Could you consider it?</p>
<p>Following Angela's advice, I created a new page <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Poland_%281939-1945%29_bce3.html" title="History of Poland (1939-1945)">History of Poland (1939-1945)</a>, and redirected the old page <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Government_f91e.html" title="General Government">General Government</a> to it. An anonymous user called 145.254.117.188 keeps un-redirecting the article, plus making edits to both articles which reflect a Polish nationalist POV and are in bad English. 145 has now taken to accusing me of being anti-Polish at my Home page and Talk page as well. <b>I therefore request</b> that <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Government_f91e.html" title="General Government">General Government</a> be deleted, and a new, empty, <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Government_f91e.html" title="General Government">General Government</a> be created and redirected to <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Poland_%281939-1945%29_bce3.html" title="History of Poland (1939-1945)">History of Poland (1939-1945)</a>, so that 145 can't restore the old text.</p>
<p>I gather this person has been causing trouble for anyone who writes on anything to do with Polish history.</p>

<p>From Ark30inf's response to me re the attempt at a rewrite at <a href="../../../g/e/o/Talk%7EGeorge_W._Bush_758a.html" title="Talk:George W. Bush">Talk:George_W._Bush</a>, he seemed to be clearly upset with the article even as it existed before the nickname information was settled in. This was the exact message he wrote me:</p>
<p><i>Wiwaxia, Here's what I think. I think this article is a monument to how bad Wikipedia can get and I urge you to continue adding crap to it until it bursts at the seams. Hopefully various news magazines will use this article as an example of what a Wikipedia article is and we can all be proud of the coverage. The page already makes it clear that Bush never did a good or non-controversial thing in his life. I am not touching this, not reverting this, not NPOV'ing this, I'm just LMAO at it. Maybe somewhere there is a liberal who can write for the enemy and likes tilting at windmills. Until then, keep shoveling it in.</i></p>
<p>From what I read, he sounded actually glad that something that would destroy an article was put in because the article was so terrible it needed to go! He seems to think that <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> portrays George W. Bush as a man who "never did a good", or at least "non-controversial", "thing in his life". When I look at the article, I do see mentions a lot of things about him that most people would place in the "bad" category, but some of them would obviously at least need to be mentioned in a complete article on George W. Bush. But I don't see what makes it "a monument to how bad Wikipedia can get". Ark30inf, what makes it sound like Dubya <i>never</i> did a good or non-controversial thing as (or before) president? I don't exactly see that. If you can think of any glaring omissions in the <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> article, bring them up. <a href="../../../w/i/w/User%7EWiwaxia_c8bb.html" title="User:Wiwaxia">Wiwaxia</a> 08:02, 30 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, I don't think he was glad. I think he was being <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarcasm.html" title="Sarcasm">sarcastic</a>. The issue is that you are focusing purely on adding negative information, including trivial information about nicknames which most people wanted deleted. Have you even thought about trying to make the article <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> or are you only interesting in promoting your own <a href="../../../v/i/e/Viewpoint.html" title="Viewpoint">viewpoint</a>? Perhaps there are some ommissions you could find to add to the article as you are more interested in it than me. Try writing for enemy as Arkinf suggested and think about whether the nicknames stuff actually adds anything to the article or whether it deteriorates it into something below the standard you would expect to find in an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a> 17:16, Oct 30, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Angela,<br />
You are my real angel !!</p>
<p>I think that the change of the article title from "Road Safety" to "Road safety" is a mistake, because "Road Safety" is a proper name of a field or management system, that include much more mere "roads" as you will see when I develop further the article, for example, it include legal systems for prevention (point systems in UK). Y the case of "Road safety" the interpretation of it is that "safety" is simply to qualify the word "Roads" , like a number of other’s qualifiers like "roads geometry", Roads design" etc. In short, "Road Safety" include much more that roads ! please consider and revert, if appropriated. <a href="../../../c/u/y/User%7ECuye_2237.html" title="User:Cuye">Milton</a> 17:14, 2 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Angela,</p>
<p>thanks for the welcome and the links you just added to my talk page. And also, thanks for prettifying my <a href="../../../l/o/n/Longest_English_sentence_961d.html" title="Longest English sentence">Longest English sentence</a> entry.</p>
<p>I do have a question. I'd already found the links, but have not yet assimilated them. Am I right in assuming that it is OK by community norms to add an entry not properly marked-up. Obviously it would be better if it is marked-up, but I am just learning how to do so. My first contribution was an extension of <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Tarski_518d.html" title="Alfred Tarski">Alfred Tarski</a> and I had no clue as to formatting. As if by magic, it now looks nice! I pressumed that it was OK to extend the wiki before I'd fully mastered the how. Please let me know if I am wrong.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Angela, thanks much re: ATV. I've restored it for now, just to decipher what happened, as I wasn't aware it was listed on any copyright vio page, and I didn't see an ital notice at the top of it either. Give me a day to reconstruct. It doesn't seem like a wholesale copyright vio (the English in the article seems too terrible to be that) but if it's largely a copy of another site then I'll take the correct action.

<p>O goddess of deletion, I seek your wisdom. :) I'm doing some research into the completeness of Wikipedia and am working with the complete list of 200,000+ article names. However, in the course of browsing through the articles, there are a disturbing number of what I would consider junk names -- AaA, <a href="../../../a/a/r/AardvarK_2f1c.html" title="AardvarK">AardvarK</a>, <a href="../../../a/b/b/AbboT_0dc3.html" title="AbboT">AbboT</a>. Are these names that should be deleted and just lost in the swamps of Wikipedia? Or are there good reasons to keep these silly permutations of lowercase/cap letters? <a href="../../../f/u/z/User%7EFuzheado_f8f0.html" title="User:Fuzheado">Fuzheado</a> 06:18, 4 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the explanation. I may be a slob in the real world, but in the virtual, database world, I'm anal. So seeing these oddball entries in there drives me a bit nuts.

<p>Hi, re /delete pages, I've long thought automatic protection was sensible. Martin no doubt would object as he has an 'issue' with the very existence of the pages (every so often I end up having to move a /delete page he had moved to become a plain talk page back to delete. Usually a mini-revertion war occurs a couple of times and then he stops) while GrahamN would no doubt go ballistic and talk of cabals, undemocratic yada yada yada. But it is logical and sensible.</p>
<p>Re the notice: the problem is that if people shoot down to the bottom of the page quickly they may not see the notice at the top. I'd suggest the page be 'top'n'tailed', ie a notice at both ends. I've put a few bottom notices in so that people cannot miss them. Feel free to use my notice if you think it suitable. Maybe finish the page with a double line at the end, again to draw attention to the fact that the page is no longer 'live'. But I do think the most sensible solution is simply to protect the page. That way it ceases to be live and no-one can claim any confusion. :-) <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 22:07, 4 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi: Thanks for the notice in Wiktionary Beer parlour about Greek names of states. I agree that this is more suited to a Dictionary environment than an encyclopedic one. As it stands someone has already established articles here for most (maybe all?) countries, and others are happily putting in translations in random languages. It's just a matter of time before someone indexes the Greek names.</p>

<p>sorry ? Doing what ?</p>
<p>You are cheating with the rules.</p>
<p>Unless I am wrong, at least 3 people want to see, at least temporarily undeleted. All three are old users. I am a sysop. I listed it on votes for deletions.</p>
<p>I am following the policy to the exact point. You are cheating, and not respecting the policy. So explain to me *exactly* where I am wrong and why you are right, and how is it you are quietly not respecting policies.</p>
<p>I think an answer and justification here would not be out of line. Or I will just know that the careful votes for undeletion I helped to set several months ago is just meaningless. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthere_36ed.html" title="User:Anthere">Anthère</a></p>
<p>You also forgot the initial person requesting the undeletion. That makes 4. I understand you do not want the page to be undeleted, but Angel, you are a sysop, not to force (I would like a gentle word, but it escapes me) your feelings on others, but to be at their service, trusted to respect the rules. I do not care either for that page, but if others want it to stay 5 days at vfd, their opinion should be listened to. What is the big deal for that page ? It is not insulting anyone, it is not defacing wikipedia, it is not hurting anyone, so where is the problem really to let it live for a couple of days ? Why bother ? And if I undelete it, why should I just feel my opinion and my actions are irrelevant ?</p>
<p>You are all here making so many rules, that no one but those spending hours here appear to remember the core of them. Those just stopping by, and rooming around, they can't know all these rules; not even the sysops know all the rules, I am sure. I am more and more often tiptoeing around, wondering if I am not breaching yet another rule, doing something the wrong way. I hardly dare approach votes for deletion any more, it appears to be changing all the time. I am not even sure I still have the right, perhaps this afternoon a new rule appeared saying someone should do at least 5 major edits per week to be able to vote :-) The whole day, I have been thinking of reverting an edit I strongly disagree with, and I did not dare.</p>
<p>I wonder how welcoming it is to a newbie. I wonder how many sysops dare doing the housecleaning. Seriously. I am serious here. really Angel :-( (but of course I forgive you)</p>

However, I have just come to the conclusion that axe-murderers may be even more devious than I had given them credit for. Unoppossed they would make for lousy editors. However in an environment that has many people who hate that mentality, it causes them to research and write articles - just to spite the axe-murderers.

<p>Hi Angela,</p>
<p>my apologies in advance for intruding into this natural habitat of yours. I noticed you've temporarily protected the page about the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002_Gujarat_Violence_5df6.html" title="2002 Gujarat Violence">2002 Gujarat Violence</a>. Since you've done so, I assume you have a basic familiarity with the subject, therefore I'll take the liberty to elaborate.</p>
<p>I feel you have rewarded edit aggression by doing so, as I attempted to commence a discussion with <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWik_19d3.html" title="User:Wik">User:Wik</a> whereas he responded by ignoring my subsequent queries and resorting to aggressive editing. You can verify this in the page history of the Talk Page talk:2002 Gujarat Violence</p>
<p>I am aware <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWik_19d3.html" title="User:Wik">User:Wik</a> has contributed to other (unrelated) sections on his native Poland, and have no judgement to make on those contributions of his. However I do believe his knowledge about India is rather limited and he appears ill-informed to say the least. Some folks have labelled him a Marxist political propagandist, as he initially named the topic a "pogrom" which is an inflammatory title that reflects either his bias or ignorance. However I'm not particularly interested speculating about his political inclinations or the intention of his edits. My concern is solely with the content, quality and style of a given entry.</p>
<p>The current version you've protected clearly lacks depth, while leaving much to be desired of the style of presentation as well as the quality of the English. As you can verify by comparing both versions, <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWik_19d3.html" title="User:Wik">User:Wik</a> and his friends' wishy-washy effort is written in an amateurish and puerile "some say this, some say that" mould - hardly appropriate for an encyclopaedic entry. Moreover, he presents even verified facts as "points of view"(even when the events in question happen to be generally accepted by most observers and verified by organisations such as the BBC, to which I have provided a link on the talk page).</p>
<p>I would therefore request you to check out both versions and consider releasing the page as not doing so would be tantamount to rewarding Mr. Wik and his friends' aggressive editing.</p>
<p>Thanks and regards,</p>
<p>-conradx</p>
<p>Angela, thanks for your prompt reply. The current version as it stands perfectly suits Wik, as it is his version. He therefore has no incentive to have a discussion on it. Moreover, he was the one who broke off the discussion and resorted to aggressive editing, a fact you can verify from the talk page.</p>
<p>I'm open to the "mediation" idea, however I don't believe it can take place with Mr. Wik's version of the page in place.</p>
<p>Also, I can assure you there was no personal attack intended against anyone, as I stated I am only interested in the content and style of the entry, not the intentions of the person editing them.</p>

Hi Angela, I was out of town for a couple of days, so I'm just seeing your message, but I'm happy to help and I will do my best to mediate.

<p>There's quite a bit of material on the places available, so it can end up being a list of counties and towns pointing to their descriptions at the time and now rather than simply source data. I ended up doing school work about such things in high school, so it'll be useful for one target audience if it does get developed. (shrug) If not, there's seldom urgency about deleting things. We could do with a better system for saying that a page needs to be reviewed later, though, so we don't simply forget about them if they aren't dealt with immediately. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesDay_889b.html" title="User:JamesDay">JamesDay</a> 07:13, 8 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>A list of counties and towns pointing to descriptions of them 900 years ago is a list we don't currently have. I'm assuming that the newbie may have an interest in writing those articles. If those articles get created, it isn't going to be duplicated content. If they don't, it'll be a duplicated list and time for uncontroversial deletion, one I'll vote for. No idea yet how interested this newbie will be, but we have discouraged further participation, because a listing on VfD is a poor welcome. On the tools side, thinking about what we need to do things more efficiently is why I suggested taking a break from deleting for a while. What would help you to work more efficiently? Where do you need two clicks and waits when one could be provided? One for me is when tracking vandalism, where I look at user contributions and have to go to history and find the edit, then get a diff to see what was done, instead of clicking directly on a link to show me what was done and whether it's still there. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesDay_889b.html" title="User:JamesDay">JamesDay</a> 08:11, 8 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm well aware that I can't remove myself from Problem Users, and I fully expected my self-deletion to be reverted at once. I did it to show up the arbitrariness of EdPoor's decision to remove all criticism of Aplank. I was listed as a problem user for entirely frivolous and vexatious reasons, and that was why I counter-listed Aplank . If he is entitled to have all criticism deleted, then so should I be.

I apologise for being, in a general sense, a problem user: I have a fairly short fuse in such matters, and I should stick to writing articles.

<p>Hi Angela. The lovely picture labelled Trillium.jpg is not actually a Trillium.

<p>I won't revert your deletions of Mathieugp, Angela. I appreciate your efforts. You can take out some of my comments, too, if you'd like. I thought Mathieugp's comments were an interesting example of a way of thinking peculiar to Canada, but on the whole I guess that doesn't justify breaching Wikipedia's rule, which certainly is well justified. I haven't looked at NightCrawler's comments, by the way, so I'm not saying that deletion was justified or unjustified. <a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrontonian_6c76.html" title="User:Trontonian">Trontonian</a> 00:16, 13 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hello. I am new to Wikipedia, but I had read the rules before signing in. I am not certain what personal attacks (by me) you removed. Could you please let me know what you removed, and why you did so on my page? I think I can admit I am the root of the problem in all this. :-) I meant no personal attacks. I just was so angry that the same few people kept putting back all kinds of unfounded and irrelevant comments bashing half the population of Quebec in a page supposed to describe who Quebecers are. In my last comments, I have suggested that Quebecois should point to Quebecers in a disambiguation page. The majority of English-speakers on this planet don't know anything about Quebecers in general and the word Quebecois is non-existent in Amerian, British or Australian English. I have open the door to Canadians expressing their views on the subject of Quebec politics in a page dedicated to this. In any case, I am sorry for all this. I am well aware that this probably looks ridiculous from the outside. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathieugp_c3f3.html" title="User:Mathieugp">Mathieugp</a></p>

<dd>I see you have replaced the cricket with my aster. I didn't realize that flowers only give one wikilove. I thought I would get wikicash, although neither of those is as important as real money. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexandros_406d.html" title="User:Alexandros">Alexandros</a> 22:25, 16 Nov 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You're right - I got an edit conflict and pasted the comment in the wrong place. Fixing now. -- <a href="../../../p/a/k/User%7EPakaran_a4a0.html" title="User:Pakaran">Pakaran</a> 04:52, 16 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The comment was supposed to be about <a href="../../../d/o/l/Dolphin_brain.html" title="Dolphin brain">Dolphin brain</a> - I put it in both. Fixed now, thanks. -- <a href="../../../p/a/k/User%7EPakaran_a4a0.html" title="User:Pakaran">Pakaran</a> 04:54, 16 Nov 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, my concern was that the ice cream article now links to things like <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanilla_sex.html" title="Vanilla sex">vanilla sex</a> - do you think this is worth a message to calmypal, separate from the beef most of us have with the lists he tends to add? -- <a href="../../../p/a/k/User%7EPakaran_a4a0.html" title="User:Pakaran">Pakaran</a> 04:58, 16 Nov 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, my concern was just generic "it makes the project look bad, and I don't know what people who are more religious than I am might think about it." I'll stay out of the whole thing until I get some sleep - I think writing articles is more productive than criticizing people on the other namespaces, and I need to remember that. -- <a href="../../../p/a/k/User%7EPakaran_a4a0.html" title="User:Pakaran">Pakaran</a> 05:20, 16 Nov 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, fair enough. I'll stay out of it. I guess it would be more of a concern if an actual article like <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanilla.html" title="Vanilla">vanilla</a> or <a href="../../../i/c/e/Ice_cream.html" title="Ice cream">ice cream</a> linked to <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanilla_sex.html" title="Vanilla sex">vanilla sex</a>. As an Agnostic, I am always very aware I need to err on the side of caution about what might offend people. -- <a href="../../../p/a/k/User%7EPakaran_a4a0.html" title="User:Pakaran">Pakaran</a> 05:32, 16 Nov 2003 (UTC)</dd>
