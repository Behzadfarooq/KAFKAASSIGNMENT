<p>The <b>Anglican ministry</b> is both the leadership and agency of Christian service in the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican_Communion_20fc.html" title="Anglican Communion">Anglican Communion</a>. Narrowly, the ministry can be defined as consisting of the <a href="../../../o/r/d/Ordination.html" title="Ordination">ordained</a> <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clergy.html" title="Clergy">clergy</a>: the <i>threefold order</i> of <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop.html" title="Bishop">bishops</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priest.html" title="Priest">priests</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deacon.html" title="Deacon">deacons</a>. More broadly, Anglican ministry includes many <a href="../../../l/a/i/Laity.html" title="Laity">laypeople</a> who devote themselves to the ministry of the church. Ultimately, all <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptism.html" title="Baptism">baptized</a> members of the church are considered to partake in the ministry of the <a href="../../../b/o/d/Body_of_Christ_e743.html" title="Body of Christ">Body of Christ</a>.</p>
<p>Each of the <a href="../../../e/c/c/Ecclesiastical_province.html" title="Ecclesiastical province">provinces</a> of the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican_Communion_20fc.html" title="Anglican Communion">Anglican Communion</a> has a high degree of independence from the other provinces, and each has slightly different structures for ministry, mission and governance. However, personal leadership is always vested in a member of the clergy (a bishop at provincial and <a href="../../../d/i/o/Diocese.html" title="Diocese">diocesan</a> levels, and a priest at <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parish.html" title="Parish">parish</a> level) and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consensus.html" title="Consensus">consensus</a> derived by <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synod.html" title="Synod">synodical</a> government. At different levels of the church's structure, laity, clergy and bishops meet together with prayer to deliberate over church governance. These gatherings are variously called conferences, synods, convocations, councils, chapters and vestries.</p>

<p>The effect of <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_VIII_1afb.html" title="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</a>'s <a href="../../../a/c/t/Act_in_Restraint_of_Appeals_084a.html" title="Act in Restraint of Appeals">Act in Restraint of Appeals</a> and first <a href="../../../a/c/t/Act_of_Supremacy_cf2e.html" title="Act of Supremacy">Act of Supremacy</a> was to establish domestic temporal authority over the Church in the English Realm. Thus, although the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_England_2cc6.html" title="Church of England">Church of England</a> was transformed into a <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reformation.html" title="Reformation">Reformation</a> church, it nonetheless maintained the principles of governance and organisation it held prior to 1534. This meant the maintenance of the historic threefold order, with bishops, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consecration.html" title="Consecration">consecrated</a> in <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostolic_Succession_e4cf.html" title="Apostolic Succession">Apostolic Succession</a>, ordaining deacons and priests. Thus, Anglican ordained ministry resembles that found in other churches of the Catholic tradition (see <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minister_%28Catholic_Church%29_1b39.html" title="Minister (Catholic Church)">Minister (Catholic Church)</a>). While the <a href="../../../p/u/r/Puritan.html" title="Puritan">Puritan</a> ascendency in England briefly introduced a parallel <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presbyterianism.html" title="Presbyterianism">presbyterian</a> polity, Anglicanism worldwide is defined in part by the historic structure.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican_sacramental_theology.html" title="Anglican sacramental theology">Anglican sacramental theology</a>, certain ministerial functions can only be performed by individuals ordained into one or more of the three <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_orders.html" title="Holy orders">holy orders</a>. There are two kinds of ministers in this sense. The <b>ordinary minister</b> of a sacrament has both the spiritual power to perform the sacrament (i.e. a valid sacrament) and the legal authority to perform the sacrament (i.e. a licit sacrament). An <b>extraordinary minister</b> has the spiritual power but may only perform the sacrament in certain special instances under <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canon_law.html" title="Canon law">canon law</a> (i.e. emergencies).

<p>In the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican_Communion_20fc.html" title="Anglican Communion">Anglican Communion</a>, the following are ministers of the sacraments ("clergy" refers to either a deacon, priest, or bishop):</p>

<p>Bishops provide the leadership for the Anglican Communion, in accordance with <a href="../../../e/p/i/Episcopal_polity.html" title="Episcopal polity">episcopal polity</a>. All bishops, constituting a worldwide <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_of_Bishops_42d8.html" title="College of Bishops">College of Bishops</a>, are considered to be equal in orders. However, bishops have a variety of different responsibilities, and in these some bishops are more senior than others. All bishops receive the title <i><a href="../../../r/i/g/Right_Reverend_ca08.html" title="Right Reverend">Right Reverend</a></i> at their consecration to the episcopate. The most senior bishops in the Anglican Communion receive the title <i><a href="../../../m/o/s/Most_Reverend_c919.html" title="Most Reverend">Most Reverend</a></i>. Most bishops oversee a <a href="../../../d/i/o/Diocese.html" title="Diocese">diocese</a>, some are consecrated to assist diocesan bishops in large or busy dioceses, and some are relieved of diocesan responsibilities so they can minister more widely (especially <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primate_%28religion%29.html" title="Primate (religion)">primates</a> who concentrate on leading a member church of the Communion). A few member churches of the Anglican Communion ordain women as bishops, many more have prepared the legislation for women bishops but have not yet ordained a woman to the episcopate (see <a href="../../../o/r/d/Ordination_of_women.html#Anglican_Communion" title="Ordination of women">Ordination of women in the Anglican Communion</a>).</p>
<p>Anglican bishops are often identified by the <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purple.html" title="Purple">purple</a> <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clergy_shirt.html" title="Clergy shirt">clergy shirt</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cassock.html" title="Cassock">cassock</a> they are entitled to wear.

<p>Each member church of the Anglican Communion is an independent body headed by a primate. A primate is the most senior bishop of a member church and receives the title <i>Most Reverend</i>. As well as being <i>primus inter pares</i>, the Archbishop of Canterbury is <i>Primate of All England</i>, the senior bishop in the Church of England. For historical reasons, the Church of England and the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Ireland_72de.html" title="Church of Ireland">Church of Ireland</a> (which is headed by the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishop_of_Armagh_2b1a.html" title="Archbishop of Armagh">Archbishop of Armagh</a> who is the <i>Primate of All Ireland</i>) also call their second most senior bishops <i>primate</i>: the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishop_of_York_2903.html" title="Archbishop of York">Archbishop of York</a> and the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishop_of_Dublin_e9fc.html" title="Archbishop of Dublin">Archbishop of Dublin</a> are the <i>Primate of England</i> and <i>Ireland</i>, without the <i>All</i>, respectively.</p>
<p>Although some member churches of the Anglican Communion title their primates as <i>Primate</i> or <i>Primate Bishop</i>, most churches use other titles for their primates. Following the style of the Archbishop of Canterbury, many Anglican primates are styled <i>Archbishop</i>. They are either named after the most important <a href="../../../e/p/i/Episcopal_see.html" title="Episcopal see">episcopal see</a> in the church (like the Archbishop of Cape Town) or named after the province they lead (like the Archbishop of Nigeria). The <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Episcopal_Church_03b9.html" title="Scottish Episcopal Church">Scottish Episcopal Church</a> uniquely calls its primate the <i><a href="../../../p/r/i/Primus_of_the_Scottish_Episcopal_Church_47e8.html" title="Primus of the Scottish Episcopal Church">Primus</a></i>. Other churches have followed the example of the <a href="../../../e/p/i/Episcopal_Church_of_the_United_States_of_America_5835.html" title="Episcopal Church of the United States of America">Episcopal Church of the United States of America</a> by calling the primate <i><a href="../../../p/r/e/Presiding_Bishop_6073.html" title="Presiding Bishop">Presiding Bishop</a></i> or <i>President Bishop</i>. These latter titles emphasize the collegiate nature of episcopate rather than the personal authority of the primate. The primates of the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_South_India_5e7f.html" title="Church of South India">Church of South India</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_North_India_7ce8.html" title="Church of North India">Church of North India</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Pakistan_ceee.html" title="Church of Pakistan">Church of Pakistan</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Bangladesh_868b.html" title="Church of Bangladesh">Church of Bangladesh</a> are called <i><a href="../../../m/o/d/Moderator.html" title="Moderator">Moderators</a></i>, reflecting their <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodism.html" title="Methodism">Methodist</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presbyterianism.html" title="Presbyterianism">Presbyterian</a> heritage. Some primates head a diocese, but some are relieved from diocesan responsibility to concentrate on leading the wider church (the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primate_of_the_Anglican_Church_of_Canada_d34b.html" title="Primate of the Anglican Church of Canada">Primate of the Anglican Church of Canada</a> for example).</p>

<p>All of the member churches of the Anglican Communion comprise one or more <a href="../../../e/c/c/Ecclesiastical_province.html" title="Ecclesiastical province">ecclesiastical province</a>, a grouping of dioceses for administrative purposes. In some provinces, one of the diocesan bishops has oversight of all of the other bishops of the province, and is known as a metropolitan bishop, or simply a metropolitan. Metropolitans are usually given the title of archbishop and <i>Most Reverend</i>. Some metropolitans have a fixed see (the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishop_of_Sydney_be72.html" title="Archbishop of Sydney">Archbishop of Sydney</a> is always metropolitan of the Province of New South Wales for example), while others may have any see in province (the current <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishop_of_Wales_2aed.html" title="Archbishop of Wales">Archbishop of Wales</a> just happens to be also <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_of_Llandaff_8c56.html" title="Bishop of Llandaff">Bishop of Llandaff</a> for example). The primate is often one of the metropolitans.</p>
<p>In some provinces, all of the diocesan bishops share a collegiate metropolitical authority and there is no single metropolitan bishop. This is the case in all nine of the provinces of the Episcopal Church of the United States, which has no metropolitans, and the single province of the Scottish Episcopal Church. In these churches, the Presiding Bishop or Primus respectively is a primate without metropolitical authority over the dioceses of the church.</p>

<p>The majority of bishops in the Anglican Communion are the spiritual, pastoral, and executive heads of dioceses. A diocesan bishop is the <i><a href="../../../o/r/d/Ordinary.html" title="Ordinary">Ordinary</a></i> of his or her diocese, and has wide-ranging legal and administrative responsibilities. Some dioceses can be very large and other quite small: the Diocese of Cyprus and the Gulf covers several countries and the Diocese of Bolivia covers the whole country, while the <a href="../../../d/i/o/Diocese_of_Sodor_and_Man_b957.html" title="Diocese of Sodor and Man">Diocese of Sodor and Man</a> covers just the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Isle_of_Man_10ef.html" title="Isle of Man">Isle of Man</a>.

<p>In larger or more populous dioceses, diocesan bishops may be assisted by one or more junior bishops. Where the role of an assistant bishop is a legal part of the structure of the diocese, he or she is known as a <a href="../../../s/u/f/Suffragan_bishop.html" title="Suffragan bishop">suffragan bishop</a>. Suffragans usually have a title named after a place within the diocese. For example, the <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_of_Jarrow_f35d.html" title="Bishop of Jarrow">Bishop of Jarrow</a> is a suffragan to the <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_of_Durham_bc2a.html" title="Bishop of Durham">Bishop of Durham</a>. Some dioceses divide into <i>episcopal areas</i>, with each assigned to a suffragan <i>area bishop</i>. For example, the <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_of_Toronto_8da4.html" title="Bishop of Toronto">Bishop of Toronto</a> has suffragans assisting him by providing certain delegated duties in four different geographical divisions. Sometimes a diocese may appoint a bishop as <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coadjutor_bishop.html" title="Coadjutor bishop">coadjutor bishop</a>, an assistant bishop who will become diocesan bishop on the retirement of the current diocesan. This arrangement allows for greater continuity of episcopal ministry but is not very common in the Anglican Communion. Where a diocesan has not been elected or appointed, a bishop or senior priest may act as <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vicar_general.html" title="Vicar general">vicar general</a> through the vacancy. Currently, the Diocese of Iran is led by a vicar general. Retired bishops or bishops who are pursuing ministry outside the usual episcopal ministry are usually licensed as <i>honorary assistant bishops</i> within a diocese (<a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Sykes_9ffd.html" title="Stephen Sykes">Stephen Sykes</a>, the former <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_of_Ely_9fd8.html" title="Bishop of Ely">Bishop of Ely</a> who is now Principal of <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_John%27s_College%2C_Durham_0836.html" title="St John's College, Durham">St John's College, Durham</a>, is an Honorary Assistant Bishop in Durham.</p>

<p>The overwhelming majority of ordained ministers in the Anglican Communion are <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priest.html" title="Priest">priests</a>, or <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presbyter.html" title="Presbyter">presbyters</a>. Priestly ministry is derived from that of bishops in that they are licensed to a <i><a href="../../../c/u/r/Cure_of_souls.html" title="Cure of souls">cure of souls</a></i> by a diocesan or area bishop. The collegiate nature of the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presbyterate.html" title="Presbyterate">presbyterate</a> is acknowledged every time a new priest is ordained as other priests share with the ordaining bishop in the <a href="../../../l/a/y/Laying_on_of_hands.html" title="Laying on of hands">laying on of hands</a>. All priests are entitled to be called <i><a href="../../../r/e/v/Reverend.html" title="Reverend">Reverend</a></i>, and many are refered to as <i>Father</i> (if they are male), but some senior priests have different titles. Most member churches ordain women to the priesthood. Priests traditionally wear a (usually) black cassock and/or clergy shirt - although many now wear clergy shirts in other colours or patterns. In worship, the traditional vesture for Anglican priests is their <a href="../../../c/h/o/Choir_dress.html" title="Choir dress">choir dress</a> of <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cassock.html" title="Cassock">cassock</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surplice.html" title="Surplice">surplice</a>, <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic_hood.html" title="Academic hood">academic hood</a> (if one has been awarded) and a black <a href="../../../t/i/p/Tippet.html" title="Tippet">tippet</a>.

<p>Archdeacons are the senior clergy in dioceses. They are usually priests, but deacons also occasionally serve as archdeacons (for example, when women have not been allowed to be ordained priests, or when a deacon is given administrative responsibility over other deacons). Archdeacons are titled <i><a href="../../../v/e/n/Venerable.html" title="Venerable">Venerable</a></i> instead of <i><a href="../../../r/e/v/Reverend.html" title="Reverend">Reverend</a></i>. Most archdeacons oversee a part of a diocese called an <i>archdeaconry</i> in conjunction with their parish responsibilities, although some may hold the title in association with specific administrative responsibilities. For example, in certain dioceses, an "executive archdeacon," assists the bishop in certain administrative functions while not holding a parish appointment. Archdeacons are responsible for the pastoral and practical management of the church within their archdeaconry or specific area of responsibility.</p>
<p>Not all member churches of the Anglican Communion have archdeacons. The Scottish Episcopal Church has the post of <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dean_%28religion%29.html" title="Dean (religion)">dean</a> which is the most senior priest in each diocese. A Scottish dean's role is similar to that of an archdeacon, but is addressed <i><a href="../../../v/e/r/Very_Reverend_a1a0.html" title="Very Reverend">Very Reverend</a></i>.</p>

<p>Each diocese has a <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cathedral.html" title="Cathedral">cathedral</a> that is the mother church and home to the diocesan bishop's <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cathedra.html" title="Cathedra">cathedra</a> or throne. Some dioceses have more than one cathedral for historical reasons. As cathedrals are sacramental, liturgical and administrative resource centres for their dioceses, their clergy are usually the most senior in the diocese. Different member churches of the Anglican Communion have different structures of cathedral clergy. The <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_England_2cc6.html" title="Church of England">Church of England</a> has perhaps the most complex system. In England, the senior priest of a cathedral is called the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dean_%28religion%29.html" title="Dean (religion)">dean</a> (until 2000, some used to be known as <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provost_%28religion%29.html" title="Provost (religion)">provosts</a> instead). The dean is assisted by other senior clergy who are called <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canon_%28priest%29.html" title="Canon (priest)">canons</a> or <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prebendary.html" title="Prebendary">prebendaries</a>. These have different roles within the cathedral community. For example, a <i>Canon Treasurer</i> is responsible for the fabric and finance of the cathedral, a <i>Canon <a href="../../../p/r/e/Precentor.html" title="Precentor">Precentor</a></i> is responsible for the worship of the cathedral and a <i>Canon Chancellor</i> is responsible for the archives and libraries of the cathedral. Some non-cathedral clergy are awarded the title of <i>Honorary Canon</i> or <i><a href="../../../p/r/e/Prebendary.html" title="Prebendary">Prebendary</a></i> as a particular distinction. Some cathedrals have minor canons who are similar in status to an <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curate.html" title="Curate">assistant curate</a> in a parish church. Besides cathedrals, the Church of England (and now also the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican_Church_of_Canada_1d0f.html" title="Anglican Church of Canada">Anglican Church of Canada</a>) has a number of <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collegiate_church.html" title="Collegiate church">collegiate churches</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_peculiar.html" title="Royal peculiar">royal peculiars</a> that function in a similar fashion, but do not have a bishop's throne.</p>
<p>Other member churches of the Anglican Communion have much simpler cathedral arrangements. Most other cathedrals are also parish churches. In the Scottish Episcopal Church, the senior priest of a cathedral is a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provost_%28religion%29.html" title="Provost (religion)">provost</a>. In the Anglican Church of Canada, a cathedral's senior priest is known as the <a href="../../../r/e/c/Rector.html" title="Rector">rector</a> of the cathedral and a dean of the diocese. Deans and provosts are titled <i>Very Reverend</i>, while canons and prebendaries (but not minor canons) are titled <i>Reverend Canon</i> or <i>Prebendary</i>. In many provinces of the Communion, the title of "canon" is a gift of the bishop, which may be given to senior or distinguished clergy - and, in some cases, to lay people ("lay canons").</p>
<p>Many Anglican dioceses group <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parish.html" title="Parish">parishes</a> within an archdeaconry into subdivisions known as deaneries. To distinguish them from the posts of cathedral deans they are often called <i>rural deaneries</i>, <i>regional deaneries</i>, or <i>area deaneries</i>, led by rural, regional, or area deans. These are appointed by the bishop from among the parish clergy in the deanery to act as a vehicle of communication between the parishes of the deanery and the archdeacons and bishops, and to facilitate collegiality among his or her colleagues through regular meetings (often called the <i>clericus</i>). Regional and rural deans have no special title, and generally hold the appointment on a rotating basis.</p>
<p>A <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commissary.html" title="Commissary">commissary</a> is a priest who acts in place of a bishop during his or her absence from the diocese.</p>

<p>Historically, parish <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pastors.html" title="Pastors">pastors</a> have been given the <i><a href="../../../c/u/r/Cure_of_souls.html" title="Cure of souls">cure of souls</a></i> of the bishop, and hence are <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curate.html" title="Curate">perpetual curates</a>, and the temporal <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freehold.html" title="Freehold">freehold</a> of the parish, and hence are <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incumbent_%28ecclesiastical%29.html" title="Incumbent (ecclesiastical)">incumbents</a> or <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parson.html" title="Parson">parsons</a>. Depending on the <a href="../../../t/i/t/Tithe.html" title="Tithe">tithes</a> they received, they were either <a href="../../../r/e/c/Rector.html" title="Rector">rectors</a> (receiving both the greater and lesser tithes), <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vicar.html" title="Vicar">vicars</a> (receiving just the lesser tithes) or perpetual curates (receiving no tithes). In time, the third category was merged in with vicars. Still today, each parish in England and Wales gives to its incumbent the title rector or vicar depending on the historical situation with tithes, but, as all clergy in these churches are paid from central funds, the distinction is meaningless. In some places in England and Wales, <i>team benefices</i> have been established. In them, a team of clergy is licensed to a group of parishes, and the senior priest is known as a <i>team rector</i> and other priests of 'incumbent status' are known as <i>team vicars</i>. A parish pastor without secure tenure but holding a bishop's licence is termed a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priest_in_charge.html" title="Priest in charge">priest in charge</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curate.html" title="Curate">temporary curate</a> or <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop%27s_curate.html" title="Bishop's curate">bishop's curate</a>.</p>
<p>In the rest of the Anglican Communion, most parish pastors are called rectors and/or incumbents. However, in some member churches where mission societies have been instrumental in their continuing development, parish pastors are called <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaplain.html" title="Chaplain">chaplains</a>. In some provinces, such as the <a href="../../../e/p/i/Episcopal_Church_of_the_United_States_of_America_5835.html" title="Episcopal Church of the United States of America">Episcopal Church of the United States of America</a>, a rector is the head of a self-sustaining parish, while a vicar is the head of a <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mission_%28Christian%29_bdc3.html" title="Mission (Christian)">mission</a> sustained from diocesan funds.</p>

<p>After <a href="../../../o/r/d/Ordination.html" title="Ordination">ordination</a> most clergy serve as assistants to parish pastors before taking up a lead post in a parish. As they have <i>cure of souls</i> they are <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curate.html" title="Curate">assistant curates</a>, although in many places they are colloquially known simply as "curates," in distinction from the incumbent, and their term of appointment as an assistant is known as a curacy. Some assistant pastors are experienced priests and deacons who for various reasons are not incumbents. They may include those who are in full-time secular employment and those who hold administrative posts within the diocese. In some parishes, such senior assistants are known as associate priests or ministers. Junior clergy in a cathedral or collegiate church are sometimes called <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canon_%28priest%29.html" title="Canon (priest)">minor canons</a>.</p>

Although deacons are fully members of the clergy (they wear <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clerical_collar.html" title="Clerical collar">clerical collars</a> and are styled <i>Reverend</i>), they are not permitted to preside at the <a href="../../../e/u/c/Eucharist.html" title="Eucharist">Eucharist</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/e/Blessing.html" title="Blessing">bless</a> people or <a href="../../../a/b/s/Absolution.html" title="Absolution">absolve sins</a>. As these ministries were, and in many ways still are, essential in the life of the church, deacons usually are ordained priests after about a year in the diaconate - they are <i>transitional deacons</i>. The term is somewhat misleading, since the order is never superseded - all priests are also deacons, and occasionally act in this role in worship. Most deacons serve as <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curate.html" title="Curate">assistant curates</a> in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parish_church.html" title="Parish church">parish churches</a>, a ministry that usually continues through into their ordination to the priesthood. Some deacons serve as <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canon_%28priest%29.html" title="Canon (priest)">minor canons</a> in <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cathedral.html" title="Cathedral">cathedrals</a> or as assistant <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaplain.html" title="Chaplain">chaplains</a> in a wide range of non-parochial ministry.</p>
<p>The responsibilities of deacons involve assisting at worship - particularly setting up the altar for the Eucharist and reading the <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel.html" title="Gospel">Gospel</a>. They are also accorded responsibility for pastoral care and community outreach, in keeping with their traditional role of manifesting the church in the world.</p>
<p>So-called <i>vocational deacons</i> are individuals ordained with the intent of staying in the order rather than seeking the priesthood. Such deacons often have secular careers. In these cases, the vocational deacon has the same responsibilities as their transitional colleagues, but without the element of aprenticeship. Many vocational deacons have careers in the social services, where they can manifest their particular ministry of care and outreach.</p>
<p>As different member churches of the Anglican Communion have different policies on the <a href="../../../o/r/d/Ordination_of_women.html" title="Ordination of women">ordination of women</a>, there are some churches (such as the <a href="../../../i/g/l/Iglesia_Anglicana_del_Cono_Sur_de_las_Americas_5441.html" title="Iglesia Anglicana del Cono Sur de las Americas">Anglican Church of the Southern Cone</a>) and some dioceses (such as <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican_Diocese_of_Sydney_702a.html" title="Anglican Diocese of Sydney">Sydney</a>) in which women may be ordained deacons, but not priests or bishops.</p>

<p>Certain <a href="../../../l/a/i/Laity.html" title="Laity">laypeople</a> may receive specific commission or authorisation from a bishop (often on recommendation of a parish or its clergy) to perform certain aspects of ministry. The rationale for licensing is that the ministry is considered too specialised or otherwise extraordinary to be carried out in the absence of individual evaluation and recommendation. There is variation across jurisdictions, but there are four common areas.</p>

<p>Although derived from the same name as deacons, deaconesses have often been considered lay ministers in the church (probably at least from the time of the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_Nicea_d0cb.html" title="Council of Nicea">Council of Nicea</a>, which agreed with this view). Deaconesses disappeared completely from the Western Church by the eleventh century. In 1836, <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodor_Fliedner_88ba.html" title="Theodor Fliedner">Theodor</a> and Friederike Fliedner founded the first deaconess house in <a href="../../../d/%C3%BC/s/D%C3%BCsseldorf-Kaiserswerth_729d.html" title="Düsseldorf-Kaiserswerth">Kaiserswerth</a> on the <a href="../../../r/h/i/Rhine.html" title="Rhine">Rhine</a>. In 1862, the <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_of_London_50d5.html" title="Bishop of London">Bishop of London</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archibald_Campbell_Tait_5e8d.html" title="Archibald Campbell Tait">Archibald Campbell Tait</a>, restored the 'ancient order of deaconesses' with Elizabeth Ferard by the <a href="../../../l/a/y/Laying_on_of_hands.html" title="Laying on of hands">laying on of hands</a>. Women were ordained deaconesses by the Bishop of <a href="../../../e/p/i/Episcopal_Diocese_of_Alabama_3613.html" title="Episcopal Diocese of Alabama">Alabama</a> (in 1885) and the Bishop of <a href="../../../e/p/i/Episcopal_Diocese_of_New_York_00e5.html" title="Episcopal Diocese of New York">New York</a> (1887), and gradually, more dioceses began to make deaconesses, but there was no clear consensus: some intended that deaconesses be in <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_order.html" title="Holy order">holy orders</a>, and others did not. In churches that now ordain women, the order of deaconess has largely died out.</p>

<p>Licensed lay adminstrators may be authorised by a bishop to assist in the distribution of Holy Communion. Normally the parish priest submits to the bishop at regular intervals a list of names of persons to be so licensed. In some dioceses or parishes, lay administration is limited to the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chalice.html" title="Chalice">chalice</a>, and lay administrators may also be permitted to take the consecrated elements from the church to the sick or shut-in to be administered there.</p>

<p>In many parts of the Anglican Communion, day to day parish ministry is carried out by catechists. A catechist in most parts of the Anglican Communion is someone who is licensed by the bishop on recommendation of the priest and local church council. A century ago, a catechist was a teacher paid by the Church, today a village catechist is primarily a pastor in the village. In most parts of the Anglican Communion, the priest comes for Holy Communion only when it is possible. The Catechist organises and conducts worship services on Sundays when there is no priest, and throughout the week, the catechist rings the bell that calls people to Morning and Evening Prayer. In most villages, the catechist also works with youth, educates parents and godparents for the Baptism of their children, rehearses those to be confirmed, and many other duties.</p>
<p>Some dioceses have training centres for catechists, in some dioceses catechists are trained by priests or by more experienced catechists.</p>
<p>Most catechists also assist in the distribution of Holy Communion when the priest comes to a village for celebration.</p>

<p>Lay people assist in the execution of the <a href="../../../l/i/t/Liturgy.html" title="Liturgy">liturgy</a> of divine services in numerous ways, as musicians, readers of the <a href="../../../l/e/c/Lectionary.html" title="Lectionary">lections</a> (not to be confused with "lay readers," above), intercessory leaders, and ushers (often called sidesmen or sidespeople).</p>
<p>Assistants to the sacred ministers form a distinct category of <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altar_server.html" title="Altar server">altar servers</a>, often organised into a guild. Their liturgical responsibilities include some or all of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>carrying the processional cross, candles, <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thurible.html" title="Thurible">thurible</a>, gospel book or bible, and/or other items in processions to and from the altar, and, in certain cases, at the altar;</li>
<li>assistance in receiving the <a href="../../../o/f/f/Offertory.html" title="Offertory">offertory</a> gifts of bread, wine, money, etc.;</li>
<li>assistance in the preparation of the altar and of the sacred ministers for the Eucharist;</li>
<li>holding the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missal.html" title="Missal">missal</a> or other books or items for the clergy;</li>
<li>ringing the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanctus_bell.html" title="Sanctus bell">sanctus bell</a> and/or swinging the thurible at appropriate times in the liturgy</li>
</ul>
<p>A distinct kind of assitant at the altar in services of the Eucharist (although he or she may be coincidentally ordained), especially in <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Catholic_1507.html" title="Anglo-Catholic">Anglo-Catholic</a> worship, is the <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subdeacon.html" title="Subdeacon">subdeacon</a>. The subdeacon is one of the three sacred ministers of the liturgy (the other two being the presider - a priest or bishop - and the deacon). He or she is responsible for reading the <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistle.html" title="Epistle">Epistle</a> (or other non-Gospel New Testament passage, normally the "second reading"), and assisting in specific ways in the setting up of the altar and other aspects of the liturgy. Unlike the other laypeople serving in the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chancel.html" title="Chancel">chancel</a>, who will usually be attired in an <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alb.html" title="Alb">alb</a> or <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cassock.html" title="Cassock">cassock</a>, the subdeacon wears a <a href="../../../t/u/n/Tunicle.html" title="Tunicle">tunicle</a>, a vestment distinct to the office, over the alb, sometimes with a <a href="../../../m/a/n/Maniple.html" title="Maniple">maniple</a>.</p>
<p>Laypeople perform a variety of ministries outside the context of worship - indeed, it is an article of Anglican belief that the Christian initiatory rite of baptism enables each believer to fulfill ministries specific to their skills and talents. Such ministry may include administration, teaching, finances, hospitality, childcare, visiting the sick, and so forth.</p>
