<dd>P.S. Yes, that's an oversimplified argument. Still holds water, though...
<dl>
<dd>I strongly disagree! Calling Quebec part of the Anglosphere seems quite misleading. It is linked to the UK through Canda's national government but that's it. It is culutrally and linguistically very different and prides itself in being Franco not Anglophone. It should, like parts of the US, be colored in two colors (semi-included).

<p>The definition at the top of the page includes Ireland, but in a number of places further down in the article, Ireland is implicitly excluded, or there is a reference to FIVE countries... -- <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonMoos_66b1.html" title="User:AnonMoos">AnonMoos</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>I think the first paragraph refers to Ireland as a "prospective" member, although I don't think that word is quite apt (since it implies movement toward "full membership," which does not appear applicable in this case). Certainly the criteria of a "majority Protestant Christian" population does not apply to the Republic of Ireland (the significant Church of Ireland, Presbyterian, <i>etc.</i> minorities notwithstanding); and the RoI is further distanced by the fact that it maintains an official policy of military neutrality (whereas the UK, Australia, NZ, US, and Canada more frequently perform cooperative military operations in foreign countries). —<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanaxp_4e21.html" title="User:Ryanaxp">Ryanaxp</a> 16:23, August 5, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, the page was as I described it from "20:11, 15 July 2005 " to "03:26, 5 August 2005", as you can see in the article changelog. I agree with you that "prospective" is inadequate to describe Ireland -- "partial membership" might be more appropriate... -- AnonMoos</dd>

<dd>Hopefully I clarified things... Pared the six nation "bloc" down to five, since it looked like we plain couldn't count, and reworked "'prospective members'" to "partial or arguable members." Incidentally, should we be using the term "bloc" at all? A couple paragraphs down it's noted that the Anglosphere *cannot* be called a bloc. Scare quotes or no, they look a little odd. --<a href="../../../g/e/e/Geek.html" title="Geek">Nentuaby</a></dd>

Explanation of drastic edit of this page: This article clearly violated the NPoV. Most of it amounted to a defence of the idea that Anglo culture is superior to other cultures; it was therefore ethnocentric and non-neutral by definition. Anyone familiar with recent debates in Britain about the European Union will also recognise several of the deleted paragraphs (e.g. the one about the euro) as typical tabloid-style arguments for why Britain should withdraw from the European Union. This is political propaganda that doesn't belong in an encyclopedia article. I have therefore deleted everything after the second paragraph.</p>
<p><a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBeroul_1593.html" title="User:Beroul">Beroul</a> 10:40, 22 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>It may not have been perfect; but in fact there was plenty of nuance in the discussions of the historical and political points. I'm reverting this. Please make changes piecemeal, instead of cutting the article in this way.</p>
<p>By the way, the 'ethnocentrism' argument is very poor. You yourself are arguing in terms of an 'Anglo' culture which is the whole premise.</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 12:54, 22 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have done a fair bit of editing on this now. I think it still needs to get clear to what extent 'Anglosphere' is anti-EU talk. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 15:50, 22 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is definitely a big improvement. I think my comment about 'Anglosphere' being used by some of its proponents as ethnocentric stands; James C. Bennett and the Anglosphere Society seem pretty clearly to be promoting the idea of Anglo culture as superior to others, and that fits the definition of ethnocentrism. 'Ethnocentrism' is not merely an Anglo concept; the same word is used in French (<i>éthnocentrisme</i>), Italian (<i>etnocentrismo</i>) and Spanish (also <i>etnocentrismo</i>), and no doubt other European languages as well. In pointing out this ethnocentrism, I'm not arguing solely 'in terms of an Anglo culture'. For example, the deleted paragraph about the euro, which asserted that Europeans are inclined to accept the euro because of some collective memory of a common currency that some of them had centuries ago, was just silly. I'm sure hardly anyone in France has heard of such a thing, and in any case <a href="http://www.radiofrance.fr/divers/thematiques/radioeuro/chiffre/index.php?numero=30070" class="external text" title="http://www.radiofrance.fr/divers/thematiques/radioeuro/chiffre/index.php?numero=30070" rel="nofollow">80 percent of French people continue to think in francs</a> rather than in euros. But this doesn't stop them from being in favour of European integration. Rather, I suspect that sentimentality about banknotes is a phenomenon peculiar to British nationalism, and would strike most French people (and most Americans) as strange.</p>
<p>I have revised the section on Anglo-European relations to reflect what I think is a more pertinent view of Anglo-French rivalry and mutual influence.</p>
<p><a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBeroul_1593.html" title="User:Beroul">Beroul</a> 02:05, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>OK - Bennett has an agenda, no question. The currency business was very questionable (aren't dollars Dutch, anyway? - an aside). <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 09:23, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I removed the term "journalist" with regard to James C. Bennett. It is true that he used to write a column distributed through United Press International (UPI), but that no more makes him a journalist than publication of "A History of the English Speaking Peoples" made Winston Churchill an historian. Bennett is more of an entrepreneur than anything else, but it seems unnecessary and potentially confusing to label him in any way - certainly to mislabel him as a journalist.</p>

<p>'Columnist' would be more accurate. I think it is better to identify him in such a way - it explains that he is not a historian. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 19:02, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>He had a column for a few years -- does that make him a columnist? Plenty of people have columns -- for example, an economist like Paul Krugman writes for the New York Times. Does that make him a columnist, or an economist, or an economist with a column? As far as I can ascertain (based on reading Bennett's book and the website of the Anglosphere Institute), Bennett is not primarily a columnist any more than Krugman is a primarily a columnist.</p>

<p>This article reads like a big chunk was deleted from it. Is the Anglosphere a proposed entity? Does it already exist? If so, what does it do, or what would it do? The article spends all this time talking about criticism without really explaining what it actually is.</p>
<dl>
<dd>If you like, it is a debating topic in <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_relations.html" title="International relations">international relations</a>. The article has not been heavily cut, but has been re-arranged, so that the rather tendentious historical argument that such an entity exists is now later. It was once earlier, but then read like POV advocacy. So, it does all seem to need working on. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 09:29, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry, really no qualities there. The USA has a British-derived legal system, but nothing like a British political system. Canada is not a supporter of the USA in Iraq, friend though it may be. And so on.</p>
<p>We really have to do this the encyclopedic way. We can't present a selective view, on its own. We can say 'advocates point out ...

<dd>Others would argue that Ireland has more in common with the other Catholic countries in Europe; that it has more in common with other small and recently independent states such as Norway and Finland; that it (or both it and the UK) has more in common with other NW European countries than with eastern or southern European countries let alone with the US. All these classifications depend to a large extent on what you're looking at. The idea of the "Anglosphere" selects characteristics that appeal to its inventors and proponents in order to argue a particular ideological point: that all these countries are part of one distinct political and civilisational area and should seek closer political collaboration. And of course, all the many factors which argue against this are ignored. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 18:57, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

On the other hand, it seems like the key link in the Anglosphere concept is Britain and not the US (a painful admission, to be sure) and obviously Britain and SA have much stronger links. So... does that mean SA belongs while other ex-colonies like India do not? To be clear, I'm not arguing against inclusion, but the article doesn't make the case for it beyond a single quote. It appears to have popped into the article w/o comment, perhaps as a counterweight to the argument that the Anglosphere concept is racist. -Bert <a href="../../../1/7/1/User%7E171.159.64.10.html" title="User:171.159.64.10">171.159.64.10</a> 04:37, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, the 'Anglosphere' is not really a clean cut concept, I'm sure. The attempts to tack South Africa and Ireland in are sort of pushing the bounds of the idea, no doubt. Roughly speaking, try using the sentence "Country X goes to war against Country Y" with any of the five "real" members of the Anglosphere as country X and country Y, it's pretty much farcicle, whereas says "<a href="../../../h/a/n/Hans_Island_6c1d.html" title="Hans Island">Canada goes to war against Denmark</a>" sounds highly unlikely, but its somehow different. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 15:57, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I wouldn't include South Africa in the restricted definition, since while English is an official language (one of 11) and I assume important for business and government the number of people who would speak it as a primary language must be quite low. Whereas Ireland I'd suspect is the totally different, as far as I can tell most people speak English as their first language despite the significant efforts devoted towards promotion/restoration of Irish Gaelic. <a href="../../../j/u/a/User%7EJuan_Incognito_13b6.html" title="User:Juan Incognito">Juan Incognito</a>Juan Incognito</p>

<dd>South Africa's relationship with the UK has varied throughout the years. Broadly speaking, from 1900 to 1948 SA was as politically close to the UK as any of the 'White Commonwealth' such as Australia or Canada. After 1948, SA government changed hands; a much less UK/Commonwealth oriented policy followed. At this time the policies of apartheid were brought into operation, eventually leading to South African isolation. Since multi racial elections in 1994 I don't think we can really say that relations have gone back to the pre 1948 levels of closeness.</dd>

<dd>Yes, that sounds about right - including South Africa in this concept is pretty dubious. The Anglosphere really is <i>essentially</i> Australia, Canada, New Zealand, UK, USA.

<dd>I think that it's important to realise here that the 'Anglosphere' is not a concept which necessarily exists — it is not a 'club' like the European Union or even the Commonwealth. Governments have not 'chosen' to be part of the Anglosphere. It simply refers to a certain ideology — that these five, six or seven countries represent one civilisational area and should seek closer collaboration. Of course, life in Ireland is very very similar to life in Britain — essentially people speak the same language, live in the same types of houses in the same types of towns and villages, go to the same types of pubs, eat the same types of food and to a great extent behave in a very similar way. If we see the 'Anglosphere' as a cultural union linked to England, I'd say that Ireland has a more valid claim to 'membership' than the United States does.</dd>

<dd>To my mind, the reason South Africa is part of the Anglosphere but India isn't is that South Africa, unlike India, has a significant population of <b>monoglot</b> English speakers. Although most educated Indians can speak English quite fluently, it's actually fairly rare in India for someone to speak <i>only</i> English. In South Africa, on the other hand, it isn't; and that's what puts SA together with the UK, Ireland, Canada, the U.S., Australia and New Zealand. To look at it a different way, what proportion of South Africans are likely to speak English to their own mother or grandmother?

<p>The main thing holding this Anglosphere concept together seems to be the English language (despite national variations).</p>
<p>As many Indians living in New Zealand have reminded me, the most populous english-speaking country is India. Yet, somehow, the status of India has got less attention than that of Quebec, even though Quebec is far less significant.</p>
<p>The picture, I feel, needs to be changed. Only white/european countries are represented, which makes the Anglosphere is nothing but a racist concept.</p>
<p>I think if one is to take this article seriously, there needs to be more thought put into which countries do in fact speak English rather than the few that are mentioned here. Another unlikely candidate for inclusion into the 'Anglosphere' is the netherlands. A very large segment (over 50%) of the population there can speak English.</p>

<dd>I disagree with your over-emphasis of the language element. It is a flawed basis to base the concept on; the Netherlands is most certainly not, and has never been accepted as, a part of the Anglosphere, despite widespread knowledge of English. There is substantial cultural homogoneity and interchange between the UK, Canada, US, Australia, etc - principally stemming from their common Anglo-saxon (for want of a better term) basis. India might be broadly English-speaking, but it is not Anglo-saxon, nor does it enjoy the same degree of political support and integration as these others. That is the rationale for its exclusion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regardless, this page presents an explanation of a concept which has been evolved by others. Whether the concept of the Anglosphere is a useful one or not is a matter which we can debate. But so long as this article summarises the position accurately and with NPOV then it can be taken seriously. It is one's own choice whether one takes the concept seriously.</dd>

<dd>The <i>Albion's Seedling</i> bloggers have often written about India. Jim Bennett and co. don't regard the Anglosphere as a hard-and-fast group where nations are either in or out, but as a network in which some nations are closer to the center than others, and the regard India, Singapore and some other Asian nations as quite 'Anglosphere-ish' (to coin a really ugly word).

<dd><i>Can speak english</i> is very different from <i>always speaks english</i>. The reason Quebec gets so much attention here is because in spite of being in Canada, it's only very marginally in the anglosphere (if at all). As much as I hate to say it, the anglosphere isn't racist at all, it's just linguist- because if someone <b>only</b> speaks english, you know what they're up to. It's a distrust of foreign people, but exclusively on their language (or possibly culture, but not race). But Indians speak stacks of other languages, which is a major drawback to getting the trust of the Anglosphere. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 16:14, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>A countries primary language directly influences it's cultural sphere. If and when English becomes the primary spoken language of India, it's culture would be in the Anglosphere.

<dd>See my comments above in the section about South Africa. To my mind, what keeps India out of the Anglosphere is the very low number of monoglot English speakers, or of people likely to speak English to their own mother or grandmother. English is widely spoken in India, but it's widely spoken as a second language, as the language of education. It's not very common as the language of the kitchen or the language of people who can speak no language other their own native language. In the seven Anglosphere countries, it is. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> 12:38, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've just reorganised the lede and the next two sections, one of which is now gone. I added some stuff, but mostly moved existing text around. Any comments, fixes or improvements please?</p>
<p>This article still needs some work. It's repetitive, and contains lots of unsourced claims. (I've only added 3 "citation needed" markers so far, but I suspect there are dozens more to come.) Of course, one of the problems is that we are covering three things in one article: the basic idea of the Anglosphere, the Bennett/Steyn/blogosphere version of the concept, and the somewhat negative reaction to their concept from the academic establishment. Maybe trying to differentiate between these would help?</p>

<p>As the article says, the word "anglosphere" was coined by <a href="../../../n/e/a/Neal_Stephenson_f694.html" title="Neal Stephenson">Neal Stephenson</a> in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Diamond_Age_65a8.html" title="The Diamond Age">The Diamond Age</a></i>, a SF novel set in the not-too-distant future. Its setting includes an artificial island named Atlantis, near Shanghai; the inhabitants of that island are called "Atlantans". As a recently-removed paragraph said:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Neal Stephenson originally used the term to describe fictional Atlantans who, when immigrating to London, were "poor in equity but rich in expectations".</dd>
</dl>
<p>A major theme of the novel is the idea that some cultures are naturally superior to others. (Stephenson shows sympathy for the idea, but does not fully endorse it, IIRC.) In fact, one of the two main cultures in the book is consciously patterned on <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_era.html" title="Victorian era">Victorian era</a> middle-class Britain. The Atlantans come from that neo-Victorian culture. So the later meanings of Stephenson's word are not entirely distant from his meaning.</p>
<p>Should we say anything about Stephenson's original meaning in the article? I'm undecided.

<dd>If Stephenson has had nothing to do with the evolution of 'Anglosphere' as a geopolitical term, then I wouldn't be inclined to mention the details of his book. If his was the first use of the word though, I'd give him credit for it in much the same fashion as we do at the moment. Perhaps if anyone felt strongly about it, we could include a footnote to this credit, in which we could mention the whole Atlantan thing. I think that you'd have to go into more detail about who Atlantans are; I was pretty mystified when I first came across the reference.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Stephenson's meaning has absolutely nothing to do with the subject of this article. This article deals with anglosphere as a geoploitical construct, any other meanings should be treated seperately. Verifiability is irrelevant - if it is nothing to do to with the topic at hand, it ought not to be included alongside it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>These quibbles aside, the sentence fails to define its terms to such a degree that it is to all intents and purposes meaningless. What is an 'Atlantan'? What on earth does 'poor in equity mean'? Mystifying readers is not the best policy to pursue; I don't think that it is a point that can be disregarded in the manner you have done. First use is etymologically interesting but has little or no bearing on the substansive topic.</dd>

<dd>I beg to differ -- verifiability is not irrelevant but goes to the heart of the matter. The statement not only provides the first usage of the term in Stephenson's work (which is cited above that, so it's hardly irrelevant) ... but expands briefly about the fictional class of Atlantans which, arguably, parallels notions of '<a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanticism.html" title="Atlanticism">Atlanticism</a>' and actual elements of class distinction/struggle implied in the term <i>Anglosphere</i>. Similarly, that paragraph deals with the various meanings and interpretations for the term, so it's completely within context. Just because (largely) you and perhaps a pliant editor find the content 'mystifying' (which I do not agree with), that does not mean it is not relevant to the topic at hand. Feel free to add to it or tweak it, but I find it wholly germane. Cogito ergo sumo 00:00, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Verifiability is a Wikipedia policy which operates to exclude unsourced information. I can pull a sourced figure out of a hat, let's say the number of AIDS sufferers in Brazil according to the World Health Organisation; this is now a verified statistic - does that mean it belongs here? No, because it is irrelevant to the discussion - including it clouds and obfuscates the issues at hand.</dd>

<dd>I have absolutely no familiarity with the concepts and themes of Stephenson's work. If there is a parallel with Atlanticism, then draw it. Avoid confusion, rewrite the sentence so that it defines its terms; after all, many, many people have never read a word of Stephenson's in their lives. But if there is no substantial link with the geopolitical concept, then a treatment of Stephenson's definition properly belongs in a seperate article.</dd>

<p>Hey everyone. Just passing through, and I noticed that the UK's musical exports aren't mentioned in this section. The UK is a very important part of Western music. Groups such as <a href="../../../c/o/l/Coldplay.html" title="Coldplay">Coldplay</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Ferdinand_%28band%29_d84f.html" title="Franz Ferdinand (band)">Franz Ferdinand</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Chemical_Brothers_5f38.html" title="The Chemical Brothers">The Chemical Brothers</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/t/Fatboy_Slim_8cef.html" title="Fatboy Slim">Fatboy Slim</a> are all quite popular in the United States, and all are from the UK. I refrained from putting them into the article because I thought that surely there are a number of other British groups who are currently just as popular, and I wouldn't want to give such a potentially incomplete account. So - next person who feels particularly energetic, mind incorporating this issue into the text? I'd do it, but I have more pressing issues elsewhere.

<p>This may sound a bit strange but coloring the entire US blue and talking about it as though it was a homogenous Anglo-Saxon society is wrong. In the South west for example religion is Catholic, history is Spanish colonization and Mexican governance until the 19<sup>th</sup> century, New Mexico has Spanish as its official language and calling <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">LA</a> Anglo-Saxon seems quite questionable. The article should differentiate between New England and the East Coast vs. the South West and Hawaii. When you include the US you include <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawaii.html" title="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>, <a href="../../../p/u/e/Puerto_Rico_f6b0.html" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Mexico_2a18.html" title="New Mexico">New Mexico</a>. I for example happen to live in an American city that flies the Spanish and Mexican flag on the same height w/ the US flag in the country of the missions and padres, <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>. I just think there needs to be more disucssion over the heterogenous nature of American society and perhaps not all of the US should be colored in blue; perhaps Hawaii and New Mexico should be colored in say, green and blue while the east coast would be solid blue. Ignoring the huge cultural difference between US regions, however, seem misleading. Otherwise, it's an interesting article though!

<li>The Anglosphere is just ment to state that the US is an Anglophone country with some cultural similarities, not that it is an Anglo nation. Also I beg to disagree that the dominantly Catholic and Italian/French/Irish Northeast (especially New England) would be solid blue (presuming blue=English). It's arguably the least anglo area of America. We'd also have to come up with a different color for the dominantly German Midwest. Finally, New Mexico has Spanish as a co-official language along with English. -DCR</li>

<p>I think there should be more mention of the cultural shift in the Anglosphere from English dominance to American. This is especially apparent in Australia, and to a lesser extent Canada, within the 20th century (although of course Canada has always had a very strong US influence, for obvious reasons). A serious factor in US global dominance in cultural production, the military and economics has been the "transference" of former British/English colonies to the USA. Thanks to the British Empire, English has been spread far and wide, and this just happens to the USA's dominant language. It is about the only time in world history that two global powers in succession have shared the same language (or one of the few). --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacRusgail_89f3.html" title="User:MacRusgail">MacRusgail</a> 20:33, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think it's worth also mentioning language as a strong factor in migration. Although this is in the process of changing, a great deal of the UK's immigrants came from colonies which spoke English to some degree, in Africa, the Caribbean, South Asia, Hong Kong and even the "Antipodes". Likewise, people from the British Isles (a phrase I hate, but it suffices for now!) tended to go to parts of the (ex-)Empire, and the USA, rather than non-English speaking parts of the world although there was once a large English speaking colony/ies in Argentina, and a few in Chile, and the Mediterranean fringe seems to be turning into an English suburb! --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacRusgail_89f3.html" title="User:MacRusgail">MacRusgail</a> 20:46, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This word may have been made up in a science-fiction book and it may have parallels in other languages, but I question whether it is in use. No newscaster on CNN or the BBC would use it without explanation, if at all. Perhaps an entry for this belongs, instead, in Wiktionary, with a note to the effect that it is more a virtual word than one that is in use. I suggest it no more exists in English than Francosphere.</p>

<dd>I wasn't aware of the "CNN or BBC newscaster" test of notability. I dare say a good many terms defined in Wikipedia would fail that test. <a href="../../../k/o/r/User%7EKorny_O%27Near_aa91.html" title="User:Korny O'Near">Korny O'Near</a> 22:27, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think it must exist&#160;: ask the average Brit where the film or TV show he is watching was made, or the music recorded or the last foreign team he watched play ( except for soccer ) or where he has family over seas. The most common answer to any of these questions would be the Anglosphere. 145.253.108.22 15:49, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, but s/he would almost certainly not use the word 'Anglosphere'.
