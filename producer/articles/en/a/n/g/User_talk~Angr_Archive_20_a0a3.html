<h2><span class="mw-headline">Image deletions</span></h2>
<p>I'm disputing what you've written on <a href="../../../s/o/m/Image_talk%7ESomluck.jpg_1238.html" title="Image talk:Somluck.jpg">Image talk:Somluck.jpg</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/m/Image_talk%7ESombatMetanee.jpg_2b5a.html" title="Image talk:SombatMetanee.jpg">Image talk:SombatMetanee.jpg</a>. Particularly on the Somluck ruling, I'm angry and hurt because you've called me a liar, which I recognize won't bring the image back. And perhaps you assumed good faith in believing with all your heart that you are looking at a screenshot, but in that regard you are quite wrong. Anyway, I just wanted to let you know that I'm still disputing the tagging of those images and have issues I'd like to see addressed. I do thank you for taking the time to view the images and offer a response on the talk page, and delete them from their respective articles. That attention to detail is appreciated. ‚Äì <a href="../../../w/i/s/User%7EWisekwai_3dd2.html" title="User:Wisekwai"><font color="black">Wise<i>Kwai</i></font></a> | <small><a href="../../../w/i/s/User_talk%7EWisekwai_5593.html" title="User talk:Wisekwai"><font color="blue">Talk</font></a></small> | <small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wisekwai_0770.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wisekwai"><font color="blue">Contribs</font></a></small> 07:38, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I didn't call you a liar, but I'm sorry if it came across that way. I believed you were mistaken about the nature of the image. It happens all the time that someone puts {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EPromophoto_9608.html" title="Template:Promophoto">promophoto</a>}} onto images that aren't publicity photos. ‚Äî<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 07:53, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Okay, I can see how you might've thought I made a mistake, and I accept that.

<dd>Over on <a href="../../../s/o/m/Image_talk%7ESombatMetanee.jpg_2b5a.html" title="Image talk:SombatMetanee.jpg">Image talk:SombatMetanee.jpg</a>. I'm afraid I used some pretty harsh words that I now recognize were most uncivil and unassuming of good faith. For that, I sincerely apologize. I realize that the work you are doing is not personal, but I still let my attachment to the article about <a href="../../../s/o/m/Sombat_Metanee_b105.html" title="Sombat Metanee">Sombat Metanee</a> and image get the best of me. I'll work in the future to be better. Your actions have actually prompted the article to be improved (the whole idea of discouraging fair-use images), even if the image is not restored, so for that I should thank you. Again, I'm sorry. ‚Äî <b><a href="../../../w/i/s/User%7EWisekwai_3dd2.html" title="User:Wisekwai">Wise</a></b><i><a href="../../../w/i/s/User_talk%7EWisekwai_5593.html" title="User talk:Wisekwai">Kwai</a></i> 17:52, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's okay.

<dd>Once again, I am seeking advice on how to proceed with Image:Somluck.jpg and <a href="../../../s/o/m/Image%7ESombatMetanee.jpg_aa6b.html" title="Image:SombatMetanee.jpg">Image:SombatMetanee.jpg</a>. Suggested improvements have been made to <a href="../../../s/o/m/Sombat_Metanee_b105.html" title="Sombat Metanee">Sombat Metanee</a> that would accommodate that image. Criteria already exist for the Somluck image to be undeleted and included in an article about <a href="../../../f/e/a/Fearless_%282006_film%29.html" title="Fearless (2006 film)">Fearless (2006 film)</a>.

A quick check revealed he had visited many of the images I had uploaded, adding this tag, and failed to notify me in every instance. I considered this "sneaky." (And you know I think that kid <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChowbok_9a99.html" title="User:Chowbok">User:Chowbok</a> is crazy-wrong, but at least he notifies.)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Deleting RFU images</span></h2>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Is there any way, when deleting an image that I or someone else marked RFU, that you can retain the talk page for a few days? At least when there was a discussion about it. I'm thinking specifically of Image talk:Stephanie Kralevich.jpg, which has been specifically referred to at my RFC and a couple other places, but generally I think leaving the talk page up temporarily will help people feel their arguments weren't simply ignored. ‚Äî<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChowbok_9a99.html" title="User:Chowbok"><span style="background:black; color:white; font-weight: bold;">Chowbok</span></a> <a href="../../../c/h/o/User_talk%7EChowbok_a1df.html" title="User talk:Chowbok"><span style="color:black;">‚ò†</span></a> 17:28, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi!

<dd>Hmmm... When I was in Florida in April 2001 the hotel had a rule saying: "No naked chests indoors at shared places (like restaurant)." Of course that is not a law, but it shows the ethical code of the people of Florida. I am pretty sure, that the law enforcement people in Florida would have arrested me for showing the shape of certain organs publicly... So clearly -according to your own source: <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#CENSOR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#CENSOR</a>- Wikipedia can temporarily show such obscene material, but Wikipedia must not allow that, since its content has to comply to the law of Florida. --<a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHomer_Landskirty_2f11.html" title="User:Homer Landskirty">Homer Landskirty</a> 18:09, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can't find the link now, but somewhere Jimbo has said we could show hardcore pornography on the Main Page (if we wanted to) without breaking any laws of Florida or the U.S., so I wouldn't worry about Pavel showing the bulge in his boxers. Pictures of living people don't violate U.S. fair use laws, but they do violate Wikipedia's fair use policy, which is much stricter. And celebrities almost never punch amateur photographs who want their picture. ‚Äî<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 18:31, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for explaining. Don't you think that's rather a strict interpretation of the rule? In the case of an important politician, including an image does more than just show what they look like- it is important that this person be recognisable. The <i>fair use replaceable</i> tag requires that a free image could "<i>reasonably</i> be found or created". There are few free photos of British politicians available on the net (I have looked extensively and uploaded what I have located to the relevant articles). Although it is <i>possible</i> to obtain a free image (as the person is still living) it would be extremely difficult without knowing the agenda of that politician and finding a Wikipedian with a camera who happened to be in the area and was willing to post the resultant image. I don't think this qualifies as could "<i>reasonably</i> be created" and hope you will reconsider your policy. <a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe">WJBscribe</a> 20:20, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You've listed a number of images for deletion on my talk page, which I uploaded in good faith. I accept that those by Ron Eggert are probably not now acceptable, but those taken by Liz Leyden were, at the time I downloaded them, described as available for any use, with copyright waived. I know her site doesn't say that now, but surely once the image rights are released, the copyright can't then be reapplied retrospectively. If you look at the dates of these uploads, they were uploaded many moons ago, thanks, <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimfbleak_6698.html" title="User:Jimfbleak">jimfbleak</a> 06:36, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, I wasn't doubting your good faith at all, and I know the images were unproblematic at the time. But Wikipedia policy has changed, and now images have to be completely freely licensed in most circumstances. Permission to use on Wikipedia but not for third parties <i>isn't</i> good enough anymore! You're right, once rights have been released, they can't later be claimed back. If the Liz Leyden pictures were described as copyright-free at the time you uploaded them, you can change the license to {{<a href="../../../p/d/-/Template%7EPD-because_6699.html" title="Template:PD-because">PD-because</a>}} with a statement explaining the situation. ‚Äî<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 07:46, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Smithsonian Images</span></h2>
<p>Thank you for providing the explanation on <a href="../../../c/y/m/Image_talk%7ECymophyllus_fraserianus.jpg_188c.html" title="Image talk:Cymophyllus fraserianus.jpg">Image talk:Cymophyllus fraserianus.jpg</a> regarding the three images that you tagged earlier today. Nevertheless, I have to admit that you ruined my day by bringing these issues to my attention. <b>:(</b> Over the last few months, with a considerable investment of time, I have uploaded several images from the Smithsonian's <a href="http://persoon.si.edu/PlantImages/" class="external text" title="http://persoon.si.edu/PlantImages/" rel="nofollow">Plant Image Collection</a> (a/k/a the U.S. National Herbarium Plant Image Collection). I discovered this source while searching for free plant images on the <a href="../../../u/s/d/USDA_96b6.html" title="USDA">USDA</a>'s <a href="http://plants.usda.gov/about_plants.html" class="external text" title="http://plants.usda.gov/about_plants.html" rel="nofollow">PLANTS Database</a> when I noticed that some of the images actually linked to the U.S. National Herbarium Plant Image Collection. Rather than tag the images I found on the USDA website with <i><b>{{PD-USGov-USDA}}</b></i>, I instead tried to be more precise and tag the ones that linked to the U.S. National Herbarium Plant Image Collection with <i><b>{{Smithsonian}}</b></i>. Unfortunately, I did not notice at the time that the Smithsonian tag was a "fair use" tag (i.e., not a public domain tag) and did not really think through the fair use rationale.</p>
<p>With respect to the images that are linked to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Species_of_Special_Concern_in_Rabun_County%2C_Georgia_962b.html" title="List of Species of Special Concern in Rabun County, Georgia">List of Species of Special Concern in Rabun County, Georgia</a>, the fair use rationale that the plant is difficult or impossible to find growing in the wild may be sufficient (I plan to update the profiles on those particular images to set forth the fair use rationale). However, there are other images not related to the List that now concern me.</p>
<p>My plan is to "self police" my Smithsonian uploads, but I wanted to get your thoughts before I did anything drastic by reviewing a sample image upload. Image:Trillium discolor.jpg was uploaded on November 29, 2006 for the purpose of providing the plant's image for the {{Taxobox}} in the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trillium_discolor.html" title="Trillium discolor">Trillium discolor article</a>. I found the image on the USDA's PLANTS Database <a href="http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=TRDI5" class="external text" title="http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=TRDI5" rel="nofollow">here</a> and discovered that the USDA's image linked to the U.S. National Herbarium Plant Image Collection <a href="http://persoon.si.edu/PlantImages/rptDisplayRemote.cfm?myPlantName=Trillium%20discolor" class="external text" title="http://persoon.si.edu/PlantImages/rptDisplayRemote.cfm?myPlantName=Trillium%20discolor" rel="nofollow">here</a>. So rather than list the source as the <a href="http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=TRDI5" class="external text" title="http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=TRDI5" rel="nofollow">USDA's PLANTS Database</a> and use {{PD-USGov-USDA}}, I listed the source as the <a href="http://persoon.si.edu/PlantImages/rptDisplayRemote.cfm?myPlantName=Trillium%20discolor" class="external text" title="http://persoon.si.edu/PlantImages/rptDisplayRemote.cfm?myPlantName=Trillium%20discolor" rel="nofollow">Smithsonian's U.S. National Herbarium Plant Image Collection</a> and used {{Smithsonian}}. I do not think that this plant is difficult or impossible to find growing in the wild, so I am not sure fair use will hold. Thus, I am inclined to remove the image from the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trillium_discolor.html" title="Trillium discolor">Trillium discolor article</a> and then mark it for speedy deletion with {{db-author}}. Am I over-reacting or are there other options? I hate to think that the time I spent finding these images was a wasted effort, but I also want to make sure that I haven't made inappropriate image uploads. --<a href="../../../t/l/m/User%7ETlmclain_4c55.html" title="User:Tlmclain">Tlmclain</a> | <a href="../../../t/l/m/User_talk%7ETlmclain_3ea7.html" title="User talk:Tlmclain">Talk</a> 16:15, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not sure how much I can help you. If the photographer was an employee of the U.S. government (including the USDA) and took the photograph as part of his official duties, the image is public domain, even if it's being used on a Smithsonian webpage with Smithsonian's copyright statement. If you can be fairly sure the photo originated with the USDA, then, you can change the tag to the public domain one. ‚Äî<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 16:19, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>not to be a jerk here, but why don't you stop being lazy and find a proper picture instead of just posting up templates? Why are you forcing other people to find a suitable pictures when you are the one with the problem with it? I have no idea where i could find a fair use picture, but i personally think that you should look if you are going to try to delete those two pictures. <a href="../../../d/p/o/User%7EDposse_bcc1.html" title="User:Dposse">dposse</a> 17:55, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Instead of deleting images without a fair use rationale, why don't you ADD a rationale? It would be a lot more useful than deleting images from articles. I know its easier to delete something than to fix it, but making a useful encyclopedia isn't supposed to be easy. If its too much work to fix the rationale, take the time to write on my user page before you delete something. Its a nice courtesy. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Arthur_Norton_%281958-_%29_421a.html" title="User:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )">Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )</a></p>

<dd>Why, and above all <i>how</i>, should I add a rationale I myself can't believe? Also, when I delete an image without a fair-use rationale, it's because it's been tagged as such for at least 7 days. In most cases, the tagger has notified the uploader, who then has 7 days to remedy the situation. If still no rationale has been added, the image gets deleted. ‚Äî<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 06:02, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Nice work on the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_nominals.html" title="Irish nominals">Irish nominals</a> thing. Very impressed. But there's one thing I need to pull you over on.</p>
<p>You've mixed up the strong and weak plurals. Functionally it makes no difference - "a rose by any other name" etc. Nonetheless I've researched it and everywhere I look, strong plurals are those whose nominative and genitive plurals are the same, and weak ones are those whose genitive plurals equal their nominative singulars. I figure one of us is gonna have to change it!!! So, you or I?</p>
<p>Good job nonetheless. Do you have a background in lingusitics?</p>

<p>Hello, Angr. I found an image of Dr. <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Hancock_8b64.html" title="Ian Hancock">Ian Hancock</a> and added it to his page. I noticed that you are the major contributor to the page. I see that you have described him as a ‚ÄúRom scholar.‚Äù I am not an expert on the subject, but would it not be more correct to say he is a ‚ÄúRoma scholar.‚Äù As I understand it, <i>Rom</i> is the singular for one Roma person, whereas <i>Roma</i> is the word for the people. He is <i>Rom</i> but he is also a scholar on the subject of the <i>Roma</i> people. ‚Ä¢<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanMS_20a7.html" title="User:DanMS">DanMS</a> 23:55, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Is he really a scholar on the subject of the people? He's a linguist, not a sociologist or anthropologist. The article originally described him as a Romani scholar; I changed it when I added the Romani form of his name so that there would be separate links to <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romani_language.html" title="Romani language">Romani language</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roma_people.html" title="Roma people">Roma people</a>.

<p>I spent a couple of hours doing this page plus lots of redirects to it from unused yet popular related phrases and you deleted it without telling me first. You say the reason was because the page had only internal and external links which is true but I disagree that it had no encyclopediac content since those links are content and useful for someone trying to learn english. Wikipedia doesn't cover this topic well and I had thought to try and improve it so that people typing in various phrases related to learning english (e.g. study English) could at least be redirected to the Learn English page to get some idea. What is the point of deleting all that work and replacing it with nothing!</p>
<p>The idea that Wikipedia has to rigidly stick to being an Encyclopedia is wrong when many people are starting to use it as a first stop search engine before using Google. Pages that just provide internal/external links to other pages are very useful and encyclopediac content can always be added later.</p>

<p>Two questions: Why did you delete it (the summary is not exactly verbose, and if a barely-above thumbnail size picture does not qualify for the exemptions as stated on the corresponding DVD cover copyright tag, what then, ever does? Why even have the tag?)? Second, what the hell is watchlisting images worth, when people can just delete them (without telling me as the uploader, too!) and the watchlist feature doesn't notify me? <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadMaxDog_2e4c.html" title="User:MadMaxDog">MadMaxDog</a> 08:57, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The DVD cover tag states that DVD covers can only be used to discuss the DVD in question. In particular, they cannot be used to illustrate the person appearing on the DVD cover. Since the image was being used in a way inconsistent with its tagging, it is deletable under <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#I7" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#I7</a>.

<p>greetings! i noticed this morning in my watch list that the talk page for an image I uploaded had been edited. when i got there, i found the archived "discussion" of your comment, along with the image having been deleted. now that its gone, i can't tell if the image page itself had been marked as a candidate for speedy or even regular deletion, however, i feel that this deletion was carried out too quickly and without enough input from wikipedians other than yourself. i'd love to hear a little more from you on why you think it should have been deleted without anyone else getting the chance to comment. ‚Äì <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFrijole_583e.html" title="User:Frijole">F Äij√∏l…õ</a> <sub>( <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFrijole_3407.html" title="User talk:Frijole">t…êlk</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Frijole_5bcc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Frijole">¬¢<small> ò</small>…¥‚Ä† Äi<small>Œ≤</small>s</a> )</sub> 19:37, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The image was tagged for speedy deletion the moment you uploaded it, because you marked it as a fair use image of a living person, which automatically adds the {{<a href="../../../a/u/t/Template%7EAutoReplaceable_fair_use_people_2fb5.html" title="Template:AutoReplaceable fair use people">AutoReplaceable fair use people</a>}} tag. In other words, it had been tagged for speedy deletion for 12 days; under normal circumstances it would have been deleted already after 7 days. It's unfortunate there was no real discussion of the matter, but Wikipedia policy is quite clear on the issue of images of living people: if a free image <i>could</i> be made, then fair-use images are not to be used. And since Wikipedia is not limited to the U.S., it really isn't unreasonable to expect a Wikipedian in Japan to be able to take a picture of Mr. Kandagawa, especially since Japanese Wikipedia has an article on him (which will give them an incentive to do so).

<p>You deleted <a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Fairchild channel-f.gif">Image:Fairchild channel-f.gif</a>. After reading <a href="../../../f/a/i/Image_talk%7EFairchild_channel-f.gif_7533.html" title="Image talk:Fairchild channel-f.gif">Image_talk:Fairchild_channel-f.gif</a>, I'm genuinely curious about policy -- there's obviously a presumtion that a tagged image will be deleted, right? Because the talk page indicates no kind of consensus. Also, there's no real response to the proper claim of fair use - I take it, with your deletion, you think the 1-1 "vote," as it were, is tie-broken by you, and you endorse Chowbok's argument in favor of deletion?</p>
<p>But the person who uploaded the image made it pretty clear that "...it is a product that has not yet been released to the market, or is sold only in extremely limited quantities, or has been <b>off the market for a long enough period of time that only limited quantities exist</b>." Chowbok seems to agree, suggesting eBay (photos from eBay, of course, would be off limits), or "collectors shows" that may or may not have the item in question. Which would seem to make it hardly "pretty simple" to replace...</p>
<p>Also - what context was the image being used in? Did you find its context "unfair"? Could you have instead improved the context of the image?</p>
<p>Or is there not really consensus needed on these types of deletions? <a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJenolen_a9f9.html" title="User:Jenolen"><font color="blue">Jenolen</font></a> <a href="../../../j/e/n/User_talk%7EJenolen_d50e.html" title="User talk:Jenolen"><font color="red"><b><sup>speak it!</sup></b></font></a> 12:48, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As ever with deletion debates, there is no "voting". When only two people have participated in the discussion, the closing admin simply has to decide who has made the more compelling argument. In this case, Chowbok's argument that the device is not hard to find and that an image exists on Flickr that only needs a license change was more compelling than Maury's claim that a copyrighted image of the device is unreplaceable. ‚Äî<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 12:52, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

The <a href="../../../r/e/f/WP%7EREFU_0b3a.html" title="WP:REFU">WP:REFU</a> criteria, ever helpfully, suggest that we would <b>allow</b> fair use of photos of items that have been <i>off the market for a long enough period of time that only limited quantities exist</i>. Nowhere in that sentence does it talk about the replaceability of the image. And that's not what Maury claimed. This claim - that the item had been off the market for a long enough period of time, etc. - was, in fact, <b>unchallenged</b> on the talk page. (If I can go to Target or Wal-Mart and buy something, limited quantities probably don't exist. If I have to go to eBay and "collectors shows," I would say limited quantities probably exist. Oh, and this particular console hasn't been made since the 1970's...)</dd>

<dd>Further, do you have any idea when it comes to the context the image was being used in? As I think we've learned from this debate, no Wikipedia fair use claim can really be removed from the key issue of the context of the useage. Anything? Or did you look at the page using the image?</dd>

<dd>Again, I'm just curious -- since there was no consensus for deletion, it just surprises me that stuff like this gets nuked. And while it doesn't surprise me that you'd find a Chowbok argument automatically more persuasive, I just don't see the actual facts in this image's case supporting it. It's just annoying that this appears to be another example of a Wikipedian trying to meet our <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pretzel.html" title="Pretzel">pretzel</a>-like fair use standards, and arbitrarily falling short. <a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJenolen_a9f9.html" title="User:Jenolen"><font color="blue">Jenolen</font></a> <a href="../../../j/e/n/User_talk%7EJenolen_d50e.html" title="User talk:Jenolen"><font color="red"><b><sup>speak it!</sup></b></font></a> 13:25, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If Maury's claim was based on <a href="../../../r/e/f/WP%7EREFU_0b3a.html" title="WP:REFU">WP:REFU</a>, then unreplaceability certainly was what was at issue. <a href="../../../r/e/f/WP%7EREFU_0b3a.html" title="WP:REFU">WP:REFU</a>, however, is neither a policy nor a guideline, and is unlikely ever to become either, so any argument for keeping a fair use image that relies on <a href="../../../r/e/f/WP%7EREFU_0b3a.html" title="WP:REFU">WP:REFU</a> is already pretty tenuous. The issue of context arises almost exclusively with replaceable fair-use images of <i>people</i>; images of devices really do only show what the device looks like. The image was used in an infobox at <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fairchild_Channel_F_d3d2.html" title="Fairchild Channel F">Fairchild Channel F</a> and decoratively at <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976_in_video_gaming.html" title="1976 in video gaming">1976 in video gaming</a> at <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_video_game_consoles_%28second_generation%29.html" title="History of video game consoles (second generation)">History of video game consoles (second generation)</a>. No use where a free image of the device wouldn't be adequate.</dd>
<dd>Also, keep in mind that all aspects of Wikipedia's fair use policy revolve around the basic premise that fair use images are allowed only under limited, strictly defined circumstances. For this reason, it seems reasonable that when a fair use image is being considered for deletion, one errs on the side of deletion when the debate is underdiscussed or consensus is lacking. This is of course different from the policy in the case of free content such as articles, where "no consensus" defaults to "keep". Fair use images really require a compelling reason to be kept, and the discussion on the image's talk page revealed no such compelling reason. If you really think that wider discussion might have resulted in a different outcome, feel free to take it to <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a>. ‚Äî<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 13:46, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How does this fail the criteria? It is sourced, it has rationale, it's promotional released from United Artists, and to my knowledge you can't find a "freely licensed image" of Roger Moore as James Bond. That's the point to the picture. It's not illustrating Roger Moore so much as it illustrates Roger Moore as James Bond. How can Wikipedia really call itself a good encyclopedia if it decides to delete images that are far more apt for articles. We allow and apparently reward (FA) images of Natalie Portman as Queen Amidala, but not Roger Moore as James Bond? It's placement on Moore's article may be questionable for our fair use purposes, but surely you can fix that without resorting to a warning of deletion? Right? Maybe I got it all wrong. Perhaps you can state your case to me again. <a href="../../../k/1/b/User%7EK1Bond007_3a91.html" title="User:K1Bond007">K1Bond007</a> 18:37, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you look at <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Moore_988b.html" title="Roger Moore">Roger Moore</a>, the image is in the infobox at the very top of the page, in other words, it's being used to show what Roger Moore looks like. As such, it is replaceable because a free image of him would do the same. If you want to argue the image is being used to show "Roger Moore as James Bond", it has to be used in a different way -- in the "James Bond" section of the article, for example, or in the article <a href="../../../f/o/r/For_Your_Eyes_Only_%28film%29_7f7f.html" title="For Your Eyes Only (film)">For Your Eyes Only (film)</a>. But not in the identificatory infobox for Roger Moore. Compare this with the article <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natalie_Portman_22ce.html" title="Natalie Portman">Natalie Portman</a>, where the infobox contains not a fair-use image of her as Queen Amidala, but rather a freely licensed photo of her made at an awards ceremony. ‚Äî<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 18:42, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So, as I stated, you went to delete it instead of just moving it yourself to make it sure it still qualified? When I uploaded and put it on that page it was used correctly. I can't babysit it 24/7 ensuring that it always qualifies and I shouldn't have to - that is the point of a collaborative project. I'm grateful there are people out there like yourself watching images to make sure they meet the criteria, but this was a simple fix. Seeing as I moved the picture on Moore's article, I would appreciate it if you could remove the deletion notice on the image page unless you still have any objections to its use. <a href="../../../k/1/b/User%7EK1Bond007_3a91.html" title="User:K1Bond007">K1Bond007</a> 19:19, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>K1Bond007: you are a sysop, so you should at least be aware of <a href="../../../i/u/p/WP%7EIUP_e163.html" title="WP:IUP">WP:IUP</a> (policy), <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">WP:FUC</a> (policy) and <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAIR_1f27.html" title="WP:FAIR">WP:FAIR</a> (guideline).</li>
<li>I checked the page history for <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Moore_988b.html" title="Roger Moore">Roger Moore</a> and found the following:
<ul>
<li>The image in question was placed in the article on August 6, 2006 (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roger_Moore&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=67989218" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roger_Moore&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=67989218" rel="nofollow">diff</a>) and moved to the top on August 18, 2006 (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roger_Moore&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=70418397" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roger_Moore&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=70418397" rel="nofollow">diff</a>).</li>
<li>This edit shows that K1Bond007 should have been aware that the image was in the infobox on August 28, 2006 (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roger_Moore&amp;diff=72464039&amp;oldid=72131607" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roger_Moore&amp;diff=72464039&amp;oldid=72131607" rel="nofollow">diff</a>). Fair use images are not permitted in infoboxes, this violates <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">WP:FUC</a> criterion 8 since images in the infobox can only serve a decorative purpose illustrating what the person looks or looked like, and if the person is still alive then the image in question fails our first fair use criteria. Images which are not in compliance can be deleted after 48 hours.</li>
<li>Yamla placed a hidden message (&lt;!-- Only freely-licensed images are permitted here. Please see [[WP:FUC]] before adding an image. --&gt;) in the article when this fair use image was removed from the article last time (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roger_Moore&amp;diff=86405971&amp;oldid=86310040" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roger_Moore&amp;diff=86405971&amp;oldid=86310040" rel="nofollow">diff</a> on November 8, 2006). The very next day an anonymous editor tried to place a image in the infobox (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roger_Moore&amp;diff=86824168&amp;oldid=86405971" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roger_Moore&amp;diff=86824168&amp;oldid=86405971" rel="nofollow">diff</a>). 12 days later the same image was back in the infobox (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roger_Moore&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=89081950" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roger_Moore&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=89081950" rel="nofollow">diff</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In my opinion the image in question is not suitable image for illustrating the actor in question in the character in question (<a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">fair use criterion 8</a>). I have placed a disputed tag on the image page and written a comment on the talk page. I will try to find a replacement and then orphan the image in question.</li>
<li>Finding a free image to place in the infobox was not very hard, I found one in <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Roger_Moore" class="extiw" title="commons:Category:Roger_Moore">commons:Category:Roger Moore</a>.</li>

<p>I just returned my blobbly little postcard image to the page on <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renaissance_architecture.html" title="Renaissance architecture">Renaissance architecture</a>, with an explanation that this is the <i>only</i> presently available photo of this building.</p>
<p>Yes, there is an exterior longshot- but the exterior is of no significance whatsoever in the history of Renaissance architecture. There are also numerous pictures of illuminated and early printed books that the library holds- these are of no architectural importance either. There is also an engraving of one of the library desks. .... What the article needs is a <i>really good</i> interior view (probably three different views) of this uniquely significant interior. As you are located about 8000 miles closer than I am, perhaps you would like to pop down to Florence and get some good shots.</p>

<dd>I'm sure there are Wikipedians in Florence who could take a picture of it for you. You might ask some of the people in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedians_in_Italy_96ad.html" title="Category:Wikipedians in Italy">Category:Wikipedians in Italy</a>. As it is, right now the image doesn't have any source or copyright information, and could be deleted in 48 hours for that reason alone. If you want to claim fair use on it (which will be difficult if you don't know at least what company produced the postcard or what year it's from), you'll also have to make a fair use rationale, which will have to assert not that no free image of the interior of the library is currently available, but rather than no free image of the interior of the library <i>could be made</i>. If one could be made, the picture is considered replaceable and will be deleted for that reason. I know it's frustrating, but part of Wikipedia's mission is to be an encyclopedia whose content can be freely reused, and having images of unknown provenance and date severely impedes that mission. ‚Äî<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 16:04, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
