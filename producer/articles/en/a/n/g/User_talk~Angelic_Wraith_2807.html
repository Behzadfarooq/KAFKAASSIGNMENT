<p>Please cooperate and understand that other Wikipedians, including myself sometimes, actually have a different style of editing than yourself — Many users wish to develop their work through several edits instead of one edit. There is nothing wrong with this. HereToHelp is a very valuable contributor to <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Macintosh_48d6.html" title="Apple Macintosh">Apple Macintosh</a> and WikiProject Macintosh and he is only trying to help. The legal section was requested by a user, and HereToHelp has been kind enough as to create it. Instead of removing information, change it and stop complaining - You have the ability to remove the POV of which you are concerned about. Thanks! — <a href="../../../w/a/c/User%7EWackymacs_1999.html" title="User:Wackymacs">Wackymacs</a> 21:26, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well I can understand your frustration at his amount of edits - but I used to be the same. It doesn't really annoy me, no - Because I usually just amend his edits on the current revision or work collaboratively with him. At the end of the day I think its pointless arguing or complaining over the way HereToHelp edits because you also have the ability to improve his edits and don't need to go through every revision. Thanks for replying quickly. — <a href="../../../w/a/c/User%7EWackymacs_1999.html" title="User:Wackymacs">Wackymacs</a> 21:43, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No, I'm not an administrator and don't actually want to be one (there's a userbox on my user page that says so too, hehe ). I have MacTracker application and Revolution In The Valley. I wouldn't count on using MacTracker as a reliable source because I've found a lot of information in there to be incorrect.

<p>You wrote the two following messages to me:</p>

<dd>If you have a good reason why you feel there was TMI on "Guilty Conscience," I'm up for listening. The reason I changed it, though, was because it made it seem as though Dr. Dre had been encouraging the man the entire time, which wasn't true. Not really a big deal, but neither is the added space.</dd>

<p>I will not reply to messages on my page that are not signed. Secondly, please do not post messages into sections that they are not relevant to.

<dd><i>As for posting things in sections they don't belong.. uh, well I clicked the "Click here to leave me a new message" button you provided. I don't know what you want.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>You clicked the right place, but you didn't put a title to your message, in which case your message becomes appended to the last section. In other words, you are posting into the section titled 'Drum and bass merge' - obviously not relevant to that section.

<p>Hey, man, that's cold! You should check some of my more major edits ;P</p>
<dl>
<dd>You're taking this the wrong way. I meant to say that everyone can make major edits. It's just that you also catch everyone's mistakes, too. And I appreciate that. <b>In no way did I intend to offend you.</b> It's just that considering how many times you fixed my edits, I felt badly that you did it unthanked.

<p>Nah man, I was just playing, I know you were sincere. Though, I was serious that I have made some serious contributions ^_^</p>
<p>Oh, btw, it's really easy to catch mistakes if you just use the compare button, because it highlights all changes in BOLD RED, so I know exactly what's been changed, and I don't have to re-read things I know are fine. It's a good tool.. I just wish there were more things like that on Wikipedia to make things easier &gt;_&lt;</p>

<dd>Whew, you had me scared. You can never tell when someone's being sarcastic on electronic communication. Maybe that could be one of those "better tools" Wikipedia needs. I never doubted your major efforts, it's just that spelling and grammar errors are the easiest way to make an article look bad, and you had fixed a lot of "how did I type that?" errors. --<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHereToHelp_1de7.html" title="User:HereToHelp">HereToHelp</a> (<a href="../../../h/e/r/User_talk%7EHereToHelp_c207.html" title="User talk:HereToHelp">talk</a>) 03:51, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>) I appreciate your... umm.. appreciation. The honor you do me flatters my... my honor, and (ok, that was a little humor for fun ^_^), and I know you mean it. At first I was a bit annoyed that you did lots of edits, but you've really made an effort to cut down on that, and it's really helpful :)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm glad you're grateful; I think the work you've been doing is admirable, and I don't mind "cleaning up" a bit. It also allows me to flesh out what you've already written; I personally find it very difficult to make new sections, partially because the page is so large, and the "edit" screen is a whole lot different than the "article" screen; after all, it's all text, and there are no pictures/formatting/colors which makes it a bit confusing.</p>
<p>That, I think, is one think Wikipedia would really do well to fix... people would make far fewer mistakes if they somehow integrated the Edit interface better. If that makes sense.</p>

<p>hey i guess i was wrong, dunno where i got the impression, but apparently Pac's the best-selling rapper. feel free to RV any references you find to it with Em (i did it in a coupla articles) <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrey_Stone_e7d3.html" title="User:Trey Stone">Stoned Trey</a> 02:19, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>it looks though, like Em's the 2nd-best. i'm checking a list and it says 20 million sold pre-Encore. if the wiki article's right (Encore's 11 million worldwide and CC's 3 million) that still wouldn't be enough to top Pac, who's sold 36.5 mil. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrey_Stone_e7d3.html" title="User:Trey Stone">Stoned Trey</a> 02:23, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>a lotta that stuff's true but obviously we're just looking specifically at his own solo record sales.</p>
<p>i'd say, we should mention that he's the second best-selling rapper behind Pac and then at some other point (further down) in the article mention that if you don't include Pac's posthumous albums Em's the top-seller. and of course we could mention his prime role in bringing 50 Cent and D12 to national attention. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrey_Stone_e7d3.html" title="User:Trey Stone">Stoned Trey</a> 08:09, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. I'm afraid I reverted your recent addition to <a href="../../../r/e/s/ResEdit_924a.html" title="ResEdit">ResEdit</a>. At first I just tried to clean it up and provide a source, but it seems that Thrica doesn't exist any longer, and there are very few live links left on the 'net. I also felt that it was only barely notable, so "it should also be noted that..." is putting it a little bit strongly! Apologies if it was your pet tool, but the temptation to add things to an article just because you liked them should be resisted if it really wasn't all that notable. Alos, the 4-bit icon stuff was a bit overly technical for a general encyclopedia article. I hope you won't mind too much, and understand my reasons.

<p>Do you really dislike the images of those N64 chips I had posted? I had them in a drawer from a broken N64 and scanned them for the article. I thought they added a nice visual touch to the specs.... I did tweak the caption you modified though, because it is related to info in one of the paragraphs about techniques to improve upon the system's texturing limitations (not directly related to the cartridge being 512Mbit). Thanks for cleaning up some of my poor wording, in both N64 and R100, btw. Nice to have a fellow technical proofreader around. --<a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwaaye_95d7.html" title="User:Swaaye">Swaaye</a> 18:37, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah the cartridge size was a big problem for sure. But from what I've read and heard about the architecture it feels like the overall system was designed around using small textures. The GPU's texture cache required the entire texture to fit within 4 KB. Obviously, that's a problem. Then if the devs want to use mip-mapping, well it's 2 KB. Developers I've chatted with have said it was perhaps the system's biggest flaw. Some creative developers like Rare, Boss, and Factor5 were able to work around the design by using large textures split into smaller pieces and multilayered scenes. There are reference links on the N64 page to a dev chat on Beyond3D I had about a year ago with an ex-Boss Games programmer (ERP). He actually talks about Panasonic M2 in a post on there too, if you're interest in that (would have to search for that, not sure where it was). There are also a few other devs on that forum who have worked with N64.</dd>

<dd>Regarding geometry rate, it was actually on par if not a lot faster than PS1. The crazy numbers Sony gave out for PS1 (750K polys/sec) were totally unrealistic for actual in-game rates. Nintendo just it told how it was with their 100K+ statement, and 100K was more like what PS1 could do at the extreme. That ERP fella said he and the Boss team managed to tweak the RSP's microcode to put out a lot more polys than the machine could do with the SGI microcode. The RSP was, at the time, quite a floating point triangle transforming monster, especially compared to PS1. Too bad it also had to do audio (ERP said devs tried to use the main CPU for audio instead if possible). He also said he profiled some PS1 games and was certain that World Driver Championship pushed more polys than any PS1 game. Quite an impressive game on N64 for sure, with its 640x480 support and no need for the RAM expansion!</dd>

<dd>Overall, N64's biggest probs were its cartridge design, texture cache, RAMBUS latency, and lack of a dedicated audio DSP (other processors had to pick up the slack). It was designed to be very cheap thru extensive integration, but also powerful enough to defeat the competition. It's also far more reliable cuz of the lack of the CD drive (saved them support costs). Big N always seems to design things with cost near the top in priority, moreso than the other companies.</dd>

<p>I reverted your reversion. Noting your comment that <i>It's just plain stupid to remove something which was placed for disambiguation, since "resolution" could be confusing in that context to many people</i>, I think you are confused yourself about what the article is discussing here. The 'resolution' in this context is the maximum dimensional size of the grafPort, which is +/- 32768 PIXELS in horizontal and vertical directions. This has absolutely nothing to do with colour depth, which can be considered a value in another dimension to either of these. Therefore "disambiguating" resolution as 'colour depth' is actually creating confusion! QuickDraw's grafPort size is not connected to colour depth at all - the same size limitations prevail regardless of colour depth (though the rowBytes value is constrained by colour depth, and does set up a dependency between the two in practice, but that's another issue). Hope this clears it up. If you still feel confused, feel free to contact me and I'll try and help sort it out. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGRAHAMUK_f38c.html" title="User:GRAHAMUK">Graham</a> 02:24, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>alright dude, don't have a period. i have an account i just haven't really been using it lately. i don't get why people are so reactionary about certain articles -- an intro is not for including unremarkable recent news like the Shady Convention and what people thought of Encore (compare to Nas's intro, for example -- it mentions <i>Illmatic</i> being viewed as a classic, but doesn't mention <i>Nastradamus</i> being judged as his worst album.) but i can argue this on the talk page even though i think it's pretty obvious what my point is.</p>
<p>and the guy who made the page into "The Full Biography of Marshall Mathers" should have his stuff reverted as well. no other rapper gets this kind of treatment, and the article should focus on him as an artist. 134.69.166.25 02:10, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>alright cool. by the way dude who's your favorite rapper (i'm just assuming you're into hip hop cuz you seem to like Em, correct me if i'm wrong)? as far as Em goes i like his MMLP the best -- sometimes it feels like he's going over-the-top with the anger (some would call it "angst") but he always balances it out with a lighter track after it seems like he's gone over the edge. lately i've been getting into <a href="../../../g/z/a/GZA_59c1.html" title="GZA">GZA</a> which's weird considering i didn't like what i heard from <i><a href="../../../3/6/_/Enter_the_Wu-Tang%7E_36_Chambers_872b.html" title="Enter the Wu-Tang: 36 Chambers">Enter the Wu-Tang: 36 Chambers</a></i> but i think <a href="../../../r/z/a/RZA_5347.html" title="RZA">RZA</a> produced some nice beats on <i><a href="../../../l/i/q/Liquid_Swords_a894.html" title="Liquid Swords">Liquid Swords</a></i>.</p>
<p>sorry for wasting your time if you ain't a rap fan, but anyhow.</p>
<p>Em better release a killer comeback album to make up for <i>Encore</i>, that's all i'll say. although i don't think it's as godawful as some people think -- it's got its share of decent and good songs, and even the shitty ones i sometimes listen to cuz they're funny in a stupid kinda way. 134.69.166.25 11:23, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>yeah Em always murders people on their own shit, as Nas put it -- "Renegade" is absolutely sick. and yeah i've heard the Benzino disses. like Nail in the Coffin the best -- rhymin' "industry" with "in the streets" and "What the fuck you stop for buddy, if you slew some crack/You'd make a lot more money than you do from rap." he's a sick battle rapper -- that's how he got known in Detroit in his early days after all.</p>
<p>the only thing is that he's always got in feuds with people he can easily destroy (with the possible exception of Canibus, but i haven't heard enough of his stuff and don't plan to) but i guess he hasn't really got any reason to diss anyone skilled. i can't think of an acclaimed rapper who disrespects him after all. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrey_Stone_e7d3.html" title="User:Trey Stone">Stoned Trey</a> 03:20, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

Now, I don't care about that much, but what I do care about is removing content (two images in this case) without any explanation whatsoever.

<p>G'day. One day your user page will come back to haunt you. Or at least embarrass you... I know, I know, you don't give a fuck - now. I just thought I'd let you know, since I'm now 43, but I was once 19 or so - but luckily I didn't commit any of my embarrassing sentiments to a database that will be preserved indefinitely. Just a thought! Anyway, did you ever get around to reading my lengthy discourse about QuickDraw?

<p>If I have a large number of changes to make, I often make them as separate edits. This has a couple of motivations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Making a large number of diverse edits with a large comment makes it difficult for anyone coming along later to see what relates to what.</li>
<li>The edit comment box is only of limited size. Making a larger comment would mean putting it in Talk and referring to it from the edit comment, which would be extra work.</li>

<p>Dan, I kind of laugh when a total stranger six years younger than me tries to regulate my online behavior and give orders. Don't you have anything better to do than tell me not just what to edit, but HOW to edit? Perhaps it has not occurred to you that I look at my page in its final form, read it to myself, and then if need be make a change. Much like I am doing now when I am editing my initial comment. Haven't you ever printed a paper out to proofread it? Its different than simply reading it on the screen for errors. Furthermore, I have not edited anything in about a week; certainly not today.

<p><i>Why are you reverting my edits... it shouldn't be linked, it should be written and then expanded upon.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>How do you expand it? It's the central character from <b>one</b> movie -- who makes a cameo in another -- and any and all information about the character comes from a single source, namely, whatever he does or is revealed about him in that one movie. Meaning, it duplicates the content of the movie article. All you can do, really, to pad things out is regurgitate a high-school-book-review-style plot summary of the one movie -- a bad practice your high-school English teacher probably warned you about.</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>If someone's searching for Holden McNeil, they're looking for the character, not the movie(s) the character has been in.</i> No, you can either be looking up the name because you've heard it in some context outside of <i>Chasing Amy</i> (someone made a reference to it) or because you want to know about the character. The former is satisfied by going to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chasing_Amy_c183.html" title="Chasing Amy">Chasing Amy</a>, since if you've never heard of name, the movie reference isn't going to mean anything, either; the latter provides you with <b>exactly the same information you already have</b>.</p>
<p><i>It's even linked on the</i> <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chasing_Amy_c183.html" title="Chasing Amy">Chasing Amy</a><i>, and all it does is redirect itself.</i> Speaking of "providing you with exactly the same information you already have" -- talk about a waste of time. In any case, that problem is easily solved by unlinking, which is what I did.</p>
<p>Let me quote from <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28fiction%29_a12e.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)">Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Major characters and notable minor ones (and places, concepts, etc.) in a work of fiction should be covered within the article on that work of fiction. If the article on the work itself becomes long, then giving such characters an article of their own is good practice (<b>if there is enough content for the character</b> [emphasis mine]).</dd>
</dl>
<p>Simply repeating what the original article says <b>in its first sentence</b> isn't enough. Come up with some actual content worth a separate article and I'll reconsider my actions.
