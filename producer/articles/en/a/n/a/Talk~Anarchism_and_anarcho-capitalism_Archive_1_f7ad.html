<p>On 20 May 2005, this article was nominated for deletion. Despite a clear majority arguing for deletion, the necessary concensus for deletion was not reached and the decision defaulted to "keep" for now. If this article is not substantially improved in a reasonable period of time, it may be appropriate to re-nominate it for deletion.</p>
<p>I will further note that the concensus was against the separation of this content as a separate article. I understand that it was broken out from another article for length reasons. The participants in this discussion found that argument unpersuasive.

<dd>In <i>Noam Chomsky on Anarchism</i>, the ardently anti-capitalist Chomsky writes, "Anarcho-capitalism, in my opinion, is a doctrinal system which, if ever implemented, would lead to forms of tyranny and oppression that have few counterparts in human history", although he adds that he finds himself, "in substantial agreement with people who consider themselves anarcho-capitalists on a whole range of issues". <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_totse"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/n/a/Talk%7EAnarchism_and_anarcho-capitalism_Archive_1_f7ad.html#endnote_totse" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/n/a/Talk%7EAnarchism_and_anarcho-capitalism_Archive_1_f7ad.html#endnote_totse" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></sup></span> Simon Tormey, in his book <i>Anti-Capitalism: A Beginner's Guide</i> places no anti-capitalist restriction on being an anarchist: "Pro-capitalist anarchism is, as one might expect, particularly prevalent in the US where it feeds on the strong individualist and libertarian currents that have always been a part of the American political imaginary. To return to the point, however, there are individualist anarchists who are most certainly not anti-capitalist and there are those who may well be."</dd>

<dd>Don't take "wiped out" out of context. He says he wants the distinction between "wage-receiver" and "wage-payer" to be wiped out. In other words, an employer is purchasing the employee's labor just as much as the employee is purchasing the employer's labor. The wages of the employee are coming from the labor of the employer. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 17:11, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>LOL! To be an employer doesn't mean you necessarily don't work. To be an employer means you own a means of production and you're letting someone else use that means of production and pay him for it. What Tucker wants is for the employee's wages to come from the labor of the employer. He wants the employer to have to work. I don't know WHERE you're getting that idea a person who owns a business works, then he's not an employer. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 17:30, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You're not letting him use it. You're ordering him to use it. I get your point though, but since Tucker says the hirers work and get their income from it, I don't think you should use the word "employers". He "supported private MOP" makes this point much clearer. Still, what's your problem? My version said "but was against prohibiting employer-employee relationships altogether." You took that out for some reason, I would have thought you wanted to keep it in to clarify things. -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfinity0_7a16.html" title="User:Infinity0">infinity</a><span style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="../../../i/n/f/User_talk%7EInfinity0_df0a.html" title="User talk:Infinity0">0</a></span> 17:41, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, you're not "ordering him to use it." LOL! He's free to borrow cash to purchase his own means of production --and at extremely low interest in an anarchist society.

<dd>It says: "Similarly, individualist anarchists also opposed this split between the separate classes of labourers and employers." First of all, "similarly" is very POV of you. Individualist anarchists are not similar to the communists who wrote the Anarchist FAQ. Second, Tucker never says he opposes "a split between the separate classes of labourers and employers." He opposes the idea of some people not working for a living. He wants everyone to have to work to survive. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 18:35, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>RJII, it's not implying that they are similar to the anarchist FAQ writers. It's implying that the opposition to class distinction is similar. How does it imply the former?

<dd>Pfft... You were the main contributor to the article... Do you have any specific complaints? The first sentence is true, and most of this article is just detailing the differences between anarchism and anarcho-capitalism.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Spooner and partnerships</span></h2>
<p>I put a disputed tag on the sentence where it is claimed that Spooner supports "cooperatives." He uses the term "partnerships." A "cooperative" in anarchism typically implies a collectivist situation. There was nothing collectivist about Spooner. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 21:19, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

No it doesn't. Co-operatives exist in today's capitalism too. -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfinity0_7a16.html" title="User:Infinity0">infinity</a><span style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="../../../i/n/f/User_talk%7EInfinity0_df0a.html" title="User talk:Infinity0">0</a></span> 21:23, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
A partnership is joint investment. Co-operatives is joint labour. Spooner wants the latter. -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfinity0_7a16.html" title="User:Infinity0">infinity</a><span style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="../../../i/n/f/User_talk%7EInfinity0_df0a.html" title="User talk:Infinity0">0</a></span> 21:24, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Why won't you allow use of Spooner's term? A direct quote prevents a dispute. It's the most NPOV thing to do. If you think Spooner didnt support join investment, you're wrong. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 21:25, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Joint investment is exactly what he's talking about: "The amount of money, capable of being furnished by this system, is so great that every man, woman, and child, who is worthy of credit, could get it, and do business for himself, or herself --- either singly, or in partnerships." <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 21:28, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Because you're linking it to the article on partnerships, which is NOT what Spooner means. In that context he is talking about workers - co-operatives. In a <a href="../../../p/a/r/Partnership.html" title="Partnership">partnership</a>, the people don't necessarily do work. In a <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cooperative.html" title="Cooperative">cooperative</a> they do. -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfinity0_7a16.html" title="User:Infinity0">infinity</a><span style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="../../../i/n/f/User_talk%7EInfinity0_df0a.html" title="User talk:Infinity0">0</a></span> 21:30, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So the link is the problem for you. Then use his term "partnership" and link it to "cooperative." I've yet to see a dual proprietorship where the proprietors don't work. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 21:31, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would like to add that the FAQ is reflecting the majority of anarchist opinion. Most anarchists are social anarchists and, consequently, reject individualist anarchism as a solution to the social question. If they did not, then they would be individualist anarchists! Similarly, individualist anarchists think the same about social anarchists. At its most extreme, we get Tucker denying that communist-anarchists were anarchists. So RJII's objection seems to be that an anarchist FAQ reflects the opinions of most anarchists! Which is, surely, the point of an FAQ? <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackFlag_0a78.html" title="User:BlackFlag">User:BlackFlag</a> 11:44, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's not the same thing as saying they oppose a distinction between employees and employers. What they oppose is employers earning money without working.

<dd>The distinction between people who employ and people who are employed is that and employer owns a means of production and the employed doesn't.

He says he wants the employer to not be able to sit back and pay someone to operate his means of production, but wants the employer to operate it as well --to work for his income.

You're making that up. The distinction is not that some are employees and some are employers, but that some don't work for a living and others do work for a living.

<p>Of course, there is no necessity according to the generalised definition. But a split/distinction specifically means that there is that necessity.

<p>I just extensively edited the article to render it more neutral and to make the flow of argumentation more natural. I know it's a disputed page, but I think all the changes are well-justified. One thing stood out like a sore thumb, though: There are lots of quotes from anarcho-capitalists to explain their positions, but few from regular anarchists to explain theirs. The quotes either (1) should go away or (2) should be balanced in a tit-for-tat. I'm not familiar enough with the important works to find appropriate quotes myself, so that unsatisfactory situation is untouched for now. -GRB</p>

<dd>Well I feel like an idiot. Both sides wrecked the efforts within a few hours. Looks like the regular anarchists deleted and falsified the information I added while the ancaps loaded the article down with POV statements. Maybe I'll try again in a month. -GRB</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Proudhon and "possession"</span></h2>
<p>In the <i>Theory of Property</i>, which is the last development of Proudhon's thoughts on the matter, he maintains both parts of the contradiction ("possession" and "property") that he created in the <i>System of Economic Contradictions</i>. Check p. 142-3 of Edward's <i>Selected Writings of P.-J. Proudhon</i> for a passage where he talks about the virtuous property owner who is noble precisely because he would uphold the notion of "possession." <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 20:27, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The passage cited above (p. 142-3), and the entire trajectory of Proudhon's work which, from the attempt to find a liberty in a "third form" in 1840, through the "economic contradictions" of 1846, and on into the sections from 1863-64 quoted in the <i>Selected Wringings</i>, emphasizes the harmonizing of contraries. The most serious problem with your position is that there are other passages, where he seems to insist on the permanent need to deal with the state, that <i>could</i> indicate not just increased "conservatism," but an abandonment of anarchism. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 17:00, 28 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think Proudhon recognizes that a State is going to exist regardless, due to human nature. He says: "By the word [anarchy] I wanted to indicate the extreme limit of political progress...The institutions of the police, preventative and repressive methods officialdom, taxation etc., are reduced to a minimum..." I think he wants to <i>approximate</i> anarchy as closely as human nature allows possible. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 17:14, 28 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The passage above also shows that he wants to approximate <i>possession</i> as much as possible. But what sets mutualists like Proudhon and Greene apart from any other anarchists is that they <i>individually</i> rejected <b>all</b> the systems currently available to them, instead <b>embracing them in harmony</b> or in tension. If you want to pick and choose among the things Proudhon accepts or rejects, you'll simply miss his method, which involves the "economic contradictions." At that point, BlackFlag's analysis is the most coherent one: in acknowledging the inevitability of both property and state, Proudhon is no longer an anarchist. I disagree, but I have to acknowledge that he's a very complicated sort of anarchist. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 17:24, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's hilarious. Even with just the excerpts presented in the <i>Selected Writings</i>, it's not at all hard to follow Proudhon's development. If you've bothered to read <i>What Is Property?</i> and the translated volume of <i>System of Economic Contradictions</i>, his general trajectory is clear. But here's the basics: In 1840, Proudhon argues that "property" in the common sense rests on a set of philosophical incoherencies, and is thus "impossible," or, by its own terms, is "theft." He posits "possession" as an alternative, acknowledging that Pierre Leroux had made a similar move, but had distinguished between two very different forms of "property." Proudhon objects to possible confusions, and, at that point, decides to abandon the old word. By 1846, he has thought about it some more, and begun to change his mind. The <i>System</i> is a transitional work, so it's a little less coherent, but he commented on it often enough in later work to clarify things. He's become attached to the notion that Justice, his most important principle, is a matter of synthesis. He asserts that "property is liberty" as an antithesis to his earlier statement, and attempts to harmonize the two. He acknowledges later that he didn't do a very good job until he tried again in the section on "Goods" in <i>Justice in the Revolution and the Church</i>. It took him some time to 1) work through his criticism of property to an understanding of its aims, with a view to eliminating its evils, and 2) decide that the terms of the dialectic never simply resolved into a sythesis. <i>Theory of Property</i> then lays out not only the complete theory by which property, made moral, provides the justice aimed at by the system of possession, but it traces the development of Proudhon's thought, so you can see how he got there. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 20:04, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've replaced the quote from the introduction by one from Proudhon's last work. As can be seen, he continued to oppose ownership in land. Now, that is from the book RJII quotes from. Makes you wonder how he managed not to notice that. It is a shame that RJII decides to ignore Proudhon's own opinion when it comes to his ideas. Or that of the editor who notes on the same page that RJII quotes that Proudhon was in favour of "limotation" on the size of land being owned/used to "small farm, one just large enough to support a peasant family." hardly much of a move away from possession to property... makes you wonder how reliable any of RJII's changes are, to be honest. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackFlag_0a78.html" title="User:BlackFlag">BlackFlag</a> 22:12, 28 March 2006
<dl>
<dd>Don't accusing me of bad faith. I have absolutely no vested interest one way or the other in what Proudhon's position is. What does it matter to me? I know that he was wasn't for ownership in vast expanses of land but in favor of smaller-scale land ownership, but that still makes him in favor of land ownership. He also supported a right of inheritance in land. How can you say he "continued to oppose ownership in land" and at the same time say he supported ownership of land "just large enough to support a peasant family"? Either way, that's still ownership in land. I provided a quote from a scholar that he switched from possession to property. Don't come down on me for it --come down on him if you don't agree. By the way, are you sure you know the difference between "possession" and "property"? <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 21:20, 28 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually, the scholar's quote was about Proudhon's "preference," which is a little different than saying he "switched" or abandoned the relation of possession. That's why it's necessary to read the actual texts carefully, and go to Babelfish and the French text occasionally. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 21:25, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>RJII quote's a book in which Proudhon himself states clearly that he is against property in land to maintain that he was, in fact, in favour of it. And he ignores the key issue of size which the editor makes. That is seriously distorting both proudhon and the editor. And he still claims that Proudhon was in favour of land ownership, even though I've provided a direct quote in which he states the opposite! Crazy. And RJII expects us to believe he has "no vested interest" in claiming that Proudhon supported land ownership? Please! It is just a coincidence that his change supported the "anarcho"-capitalist position? As for coming down on the editor, well the editor did not come here and selectively quote himself, did he? At least he provided Proudhon's own words on the subject. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackFlag_0a78.html" title="User:BlackFlag">BlackFlag</a> 22:34, 28 March 2006

Would he say that Proudhon was, in fact mistaken and did not really mean what he wrote? Which is why he included it in his book? And how does Edward's intepretation conflict with my one, once the relevant context is provided of Edward's? Edward was clear that Proudhon was referring to property used by a peasant family, i.e. land which was occupied and used. Even Edward does not support *your* interpretation of his argument.

<dd>"Theft" whatever. If something is theft then it had to have been someone's property in the first place in order for it to be theft. As assertion of theft is an assertion of property. But, even if he thinks it's theft he still supports it as a defense against the State. In other words, he's tossing out natural law deontology and choosing consequentialism.

<dl>
<dd>There's no need for "other words," since Proudhon is remarkably clear in <i>What Is Property?</i> Of course "theft" assumes property; that's the rhetorical strategy. He then supplements that with the much longer and more important analysis of property as "impossible." And there's more than just a pragmatics at work. Unfortunately, there isn't much from <i>De la création de l'ordre dans l'humanité</i> in the <i>Selected Writings</i>, but even what we do get shows the importance of the dialectic and various metaphysical speculations to Proudhon's political philosophy. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 19:22, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If Proudhon is advocating property as a defense against the state then, obviously, the state still exists. He is not discussing an anarchist society. Moreover, he did not advocate "property" in the usual sense, he advocated "property" spread equally through society, limited to (e.g.) the amount of land an peasant family could work. RJII ignores that little fact. Proudhon's argument about "property" being "theft" is that the land is the common property of all and anyone who takes more than they use personally steals it from the rest. Rent, as such, is also theft. Similarly, the capitalist steals the rightful property of the worker by making profits from their labour. He argued that workers should manage their own work and own the product of their labour ("capital" would be owned by those who use it, i.e. society as any new worker would automatically become an associate and have the same rights as existing ones). His later arguments do not contradict this. It is a shame I have to explain the basics of Proudhon's argument as RJII really does not understand Proudhon or seems like he wants to. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackFlag_0a78.html" title="User:BlackFlag">User:BlackFlag</a> 08:50 30, March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Of course the state still exists. Proudhon didn't think human nature was going to change overnight. He recognized that there would probably always be a state. "By the word [anarchy] I wanted to indicate the extreme limit of political progress...The institutions of the police, preventative and repressive methods officialdom, taxation etc., are reduced to a minimum." The best one can hope for is to minimize the ability of the State to encroach on individual liberty. One of the ways to do this by having "private property": "principal function of private property within the political system will be to act as a counterweight to the power of the State, and by so doing to insure the liberty of the individual." And, if you think he thought "land is the common property of all" then you don't know the first thing about Proudhon. He opposes the idea of collective ownership of land and any other communist notions. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 08:09, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would suggest you read "What is Property?" particularly Chapter III, part 1 ("The land cannot be appropriated"). Or how about these quotes from said work? "Every occupant is, then, necessarily a possessor or usufructuary, a condition that excludes proprietorship." The "right of the usufructuary is such that he is responsible for the thing entrusted to him; he must use it in conformity with general utility . . . the usufructuary is under the supervision of society and subject to the condition of labour and the law of equality." [page 66] This is because Proudhon believed that "property in produce, even if this is allowed, does not mean property in the means of production. . . [workers] are, if you like, proprietors of their products, but none proprietor of the means of production. The right to the produce is exclusively jus in re; the right to the means is common, jus ad rem." [page 86] So the land would obviously be owned in "common" and used by individuals based on possession/use. I can provide numerous other quotes on this matter, but I suppose RJII will (as usual) ignore them. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackFlag_0a78.html" title="User:BlackFlag">User:BlackFlag</a> 09:16 30, March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No he does not want the land to be owned in common. It's too communist and he detests communism. "Now in 1840 I categorically rejected the notion of the right of propery. Those who have read my first Memoir know that I rejected it for both <b>the group</b> and the individual, the nation and the citizen, and thus <b>I was not advocating communism</b> or State ownership." <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 08:24, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Who said he was advocating communism or state ownership? Not I. And he rejected the idea that the group would be a property owner because he was against property! Proudhon argued that the "right to the produce is exclusively jus in re; the right to the means is common." I wonder what he could have meant by that? Oh, that *is* a difficult one... Could it mean that the land was held in common and people could use it as they wanted? Subject, of course, to the "supervision of society" (I wonder what that could mean?). For Proudhon, "the land is indispensable to our existence, -- consequently a common thing, consequently insusceptible of appropriation." ("What is property", chapter 3). I wonder what he could have meant by that? "the land is . . . a common thing"? Difficult. Perhaps RJII could explain what this "really" means, as he is obviously such an expert on Proudhon. I'm sorry, but this is a waste of my time. RJII really has no idea what Proudhon's ideas were or even what anarchism is. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackFlag_0a78.html" title="User:BlackFlag">User:BlackFlag</a> 14:43 30, March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I really wish RJII would spend some time actually reading the people he quotes. If you look at "Equitable Commerce," Warren discusses what he considers to be valid rent -- namely the repaying of the cost to produce something and repay wear and tear. "The owner of machinery would receive nothing from the mere ownership of it . . . Rents of houses, lands, etc., being limited and determined by the same principle." So rent of a house would be the cost of maintaining it (so hardly rent at all). He even states that land "should be accessible to all without price," and any cost would be "the labour of buying and selling it." In other words, no rent as is understood today even for already occupied land. In other words, RJII is (yet again) wrong. I do wish he would find out about the ideas of the people he decides to quote, it would save me so much time! <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackFlag_0a78.html" title="User:BlackFlag">User:BlackFlag</a> 13:50, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What do you think that land "should be accessible to all without price" means? You say that this is not about rent, but surely rent is paying for land you use but do not own. If there is no rent for the use of land then it is an "occupancy and use" regime. If buying the land someone uses is based solely on the labour cost of the transaction then, clearly, the land itself is *not* owned and not being bought. As for not charging more than to cover cost, he is arguing that you do no pay for the *use* of something like a house (which cost labour to build). I will agree that Warren did not use the term "occupancy and use" (neither did Proudhon, etc.) but in practice that is what he advocated (or something so close it is difficult to determine a real difference). <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackFlag_0a78.html" title="User:BlackFlag">User:BlackFlag</a> 08:35, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's some crazy stretches and manipulations you're making there. Warren had no occupancy and use restrictions for owning land. He saw nothing at all wrong with buying land, keeping it for oneself, or selling it to someone else. What he had a problem with is profiting from selling the land. He even set up anarchists colonies like this (such as <a href="../../../u/t/o/Utopia_%28anarchist_community%29.html" title="Utopia (anarchist community)">Utopia (anarchist community)</a> and Modern Times. He would by large expanses of land then sell lots to people. The people couldn't just come in and move in for free on to unoccupied land. They had to buy a lot (under the agreement that they would sell it at cost when they sold it). <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 07:58, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You *really* do not understand what you are talking about. Yes, Warren bought land (he had too, he was not living in an anarchist society!). He then had to (according to his own principles) recoup his cost and so sold lots to this land based on the price he had to pay to do so! The reason why people could not move in for free was because he had paid for the land (as you note!) as he was living under a state which enforced private property in land! How things would work in a free society is somewhat different, surely?

<dd>Wow. You truly don't know much at all about Warren. Even for an anarchist society he supports buying and selling of land. Read <i>Equitable Commerce</i>. "Referring to the land question, Warren doubted the need for the assault upon legal land titles.

<p>What's clear is that, <b>in practice</b>, Warren seems to have followed the principle of occupancy and use. He didn't claim any further control over the property on which the Time Store had operated, although he lawfully could have, even if only to transfer "ownership" on the cost principle. Given that, including Warren among those who didn't follow the principle of occupancy and use isn't quite right, no matter his theoretical thoughts on rent. There probably isn't a simple, useful yes-or-no answer to this one. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 19:01, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In practice he bought and sold land when he was creating anarchist colonies. He got investors, purchased land, then sold lots to potential residents. Besides, what one does in practice is not that relevant in order to relay a person's philosophy. For example, Tucker opposed "usury" but he lived off of an interest-earning annuity as a result of an inheritance he received. Nowhere in Warren's philosophy can you find him placing a condition on occupancy and use for land. He had no such restriction. The same for Stephen Pearl Andrews. The occupancy and use idea didn't come until Tucker --I'm sure with some influence from Proudon. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 19:12, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Nowhere in his philosophy"? You're not trying to tell me you've read all of Warren's writings, are you? I'm quite certain you haven't skimmed the surface of Andrew's theoretical writings. Assuming you've been lucky enough to get your hands on them, they're pretty damned hard to wade through. I haven't read <b>all</b> of Warren or Andrews either, and I've been fortunate enough to get my hands on some very rare pieces. Why the bluster? If you really have no agenda except an interest in the individualists, then there's no reason to get defensive when other interested researchers disagree with you. But you're constantly tossing off these rash statements - no "occupancy and use until Tucker," for example - that obviously aren't supported by the depth of research you would need to seriously assert them. As for practice having nothing to do with theory, that's simply a POV. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 19:35, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Martin points out that Warren didn't have the occupancy and use restriction. That's being looked up now. When it's found are you going to argue against it? I'm not sure, but I think you're kind of new to Wikipedia, so I hope you realize that it's improper to take information out of an article if it's backed by a credible source.

<dd>If the primary sources do not support the claims in the secondary sources, then the "credible" nature of the secondary source is up in the air. Having checked Martin's footnotes very carefully against the primary sources, I've got a pretty clear sense of in what regards<i>Men Against the State</i> is credible. The fact that Warren does not specifically address the question of occupancy and use in <i>Equitable Commerce</i> might be telling, except for the practical details of his history (and to treat Warren as anything other than a practical reformer seems to miss the entire spirit of his career.) But we happen to know that: "<i>During Warren's first residence in Cincinnati, he obtained a lease for ninety-nine years from Mr. Nicholas Longworth, the well-known real estate owner, of a property extending from Elm to John Streets and from Fifth to Ninth Streets, giving him eight blocks of the best building land in Cincinnati. Upon this estate he built a few brick houses, in one of which he lived for several years. It was here at the corner of Fifth and Elm Streets, that he set up his first Equity store. After the store was terminated, the intensity of Warren's convictions deepened in regard to holding land for speculative purposes. Believing as he did that the only legitimate title to property is labor, that wealth acquired by the rise of land values, due not to any action of the individual owner but to social causes beyond his control, is opposed to the principle of Equity, he felt that he could no longer retain his title to an estate whose value would continue to augment without any effort on the part of the possessor. He therefore went to Mr. Longworth and returned unconditionally the lease he held, thus voluntarily depriving himself of property rights which, had he chosen to retain them, would, before many years elapsed, have made him a wealthy man.</i>" (Bailie, <a href="http://www.libertarian-labyrinth.org/warren/1stAmAnarch.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.libertarian-labyrinth.org/warren/1stAmAnarch.pdf" rel="nofollow"><i>The First American Anarchist</i></a> pp.16-17).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Secondary source tag</span></h2>
<p>I put a tag on the article because the "An Anarchist FAQ" is being used as a secondary source on this article. According to Wikipedia policy: "Partisan political and religious (or anti-religious) sources should be treated with caution, although political bias is not in itself a reason not to use a source. Widely acknowledged extremist political, religious and other websites — for example, those belonging to Stormfront, Hamas, the Aryan Nations website or the Socialist Workers Party — should never be used as sources for Wikipedia, except as primary sources i.e. in articles discussing the opinions of that organization or the opinions of a larger like-minded group, but even then should be used with great caution, and should not be relied upon as a sole source." I would call the origin website of the FAQ a partisan political source. So, it should not be used a secondary source. All statements cited by that FAQ should be deleted. What's especially troubling is that authoers of the FAQ who edit Wikipedia, when a source is requested of them, can simply add their original research to the FAQ and then attempt to cite the FAQ here (as we have seen above). <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 20:26, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

So the <i>FAQ</i> ought to be citable as a primary source <b>anywhere</b> where the question is "what do anarchists believe?"

<dd>If you quote him about the nature of anarchism in general, it is probably still a primary source. But all we're really doing here is exposing the inanity of the Wikipedia guidelines. If you can force the <i>FAQ</i> to fit only the "secondary source" category, then you can <i>game</i> it out of the entries.

<dd>LOL. I do have good faith. But, I don't have faith in a FAQ written by a a collective of Joe Blow Internet Anarchists. And, I don't think you should either. It doesn't <i>matter</i> what anarchists think, unless they're notable anarchists. Don't you realize that? There is a reason for the policy. One of the things the policy helps prevent is people like BlagFlag from doing original research, and then when source is requested of him, going and adding it to the FAQ and coming back and citing it. Are you opposed to the original research policy? <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 01:15, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What the policy actually prevents is doing <i>much of any research whatsoever.</i> The<a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> policy could be applied, by the rules, to the majority of material in any of the anarchism entries. The only synthesis that should exist here is one which is entirely uncontroversial. In the case of actively contested concepts like anarchism, you're not going to have that. You're also not going to have "notable anarchists," except in a totally skewed academic/Wikipedia sense.

<dd>Well, what can I say. An anarchist FAQ written by anarchists which is linked to and obviously well respected by most other anarchists is not considered a "primary" source? Given that this webpage is going to be published by a (if not the) leading anarchist publisher, I think we can say it is a primary source. I'm sick of this. This is my last post (on this page). I've leaving Wikipedia (see my user talk page for details). For those anarchists who remain, please keep up your essential work. I'm just sorry I don't have the time or energy left to help.

<dd>I wondered how RJII would rationalise barring "An Anarchist FAQ" once AK Press announced that on its webpage it was publishing it. He is claiming that it is "self-published"! Sadly, untrue. AK Press is not part of "An Anarchist FAQ" or vice versa, so it is *not* self-published (as anyone with some knowledge of the anarchist movement would know). Unless he means that as AK Press is an anarchist publisher and the FAQ is written by anarchists and about anarchism then it is "self-published"? Which means he is arguing that anarchists cannot be quoted on anarchism. Now that there is clear independent evidence that it *is* being published by a leading anarchist publisher it cannot be denied by RJII that it is a primary source (according to Wikipedia rulers, it reflects "the opinions of that organization or the opinions of a larger like-minded group"). Not that i think these obvious facts will make much difference as RJII's dislike of "An Anarchist FAQ" is well known. I'm sure that he will come up with yet another spurious reason for barring it now that this one has been debunked.

<dd>How pathetic. AK Press has publically announced it is going to be published and, as such, shows that the AFAQ is a primary source, i.e. reflects "the opinions . . . of a larger group" (and that is ignoring the numerous links and mirrors by other anarchists). It is written by *anarchists* and, as such, is a credible source on anarchism. The fact that AK Press is publishing it and it is mirrored and linked to by numerous anarchist webpages shows that other anarchists think it has credibility. I'm not aware that Bakunin, Kropotkin, Goldman, Berkman, etc., had "scholarly credibility" -- did they have degrees in anarchism? And I've read enough people with "scholarly credibility" make serious and obvious mistakes about anarchism. The simple fact is RJII hates AFAQ and seeks any spurious reason to bar its use. I'm sure if it were saying how "anarcho-capitalism" was a form of anarchism, things would be radically different. The facts are that AFAQ is about anarchism, written by well-known anarchists (the main contributor is a regular writer for Freedom and other anarchist papers). It is linked to and mirrored by many, many anarchist webpages. It is being published by a (if not the) leading anarchist publisher. It is a primary source, deal with it.

<dd>First known use was in 1854 by William Thackeray. But, it just meant the ownership of capital. And, it continued to only mean that for a long period of time. It didn't start referring to an economic system until the 20th century. So, yes, it is problematic to say that. Some anarchists never mention "capitalism." Also, when some do, they're just referring to ownership of capital --rather than a laissez-faire minimal state system it refers to now. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 17:12, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Terry M. Perlin, in <i>Contemporary Anarchism</i> quotes an early American individualist anarchist: "European anarchists are less introspective than us. They concern themselves more with the mass movement that we do; they fight the capitalist; we fight Comstock. Instead of participating in the trade unions, organizing the unemployed, or indulging in soap-box oratory, we rent comfortable halls and change ten cents admission...Instead of inspiring the workers with revolutionary ideas we teach them speculative theories of liberty." <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 18:54, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>"Capitalism is at least tolerable, which cannot be said of Socialism or Communism" -Benjamin Tucker (cited in Martin, <i>Men Against the State</i>) <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 19:32, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>There's a well-defined mutualist / individualist anarchist tradition that opposes "capitalism" (understood as what has developed <i>in the name of the free market</i>) with <i>genuinely free markets.</i> It appears in its simplest form in Tucker's "plumb line" anarchism and his opposition to "the four monopolies" which characterize, on his view, historical capitalism, and prevent the actual free operation of market principles. It is true that some proponents of "capitalism" mean something much like what mutualists mean by a "genuinely free market," which complicates questions enormously. There's no understanding the debate without grappling with the possibility that what we commonly think of as capitalism (the "actually-existing" variety) is not really a "free market." Formulas like Kevin Carson's "free-market anti-capitalism" are pleasantly clear, compared to specialized and purified definitions of "capitalism," because they at least make it clear that there is a question there. The term "capitalism" appears to go back to the early 19th century, and was, according to various accounts, used initially by opponents. We've actually been through this fairly recently, but I can probably dig up the sources again. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 20:45, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> notes uses of <i>capitalism</i> as early as 1854 <i>in English</i>, and for <i>capitalist</i> in the late 18th century. But <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Batchelder_Greene_060a.html" title="William Batchelder Greene">William Batchelder Greene</a> used "capitalism" in an essay in 1849, in the second part of <a href="http://libertarian-labyrinth.org/mutual/wbg-equality2.html" class="external text" title="http://libertarian-labyrinth.org/mutual/wbg-equality2.html" rel="nofollow"><i>Equality</i></a>, where he, characteristically, damns capitalism, socialism <i>and</i> communism individually, and calls for a mutualist <i>balancing of aims</i>. It's likely that Greene, who embraced a sort of irreducible "<i>tri</i>-alectics" about the time Proudhon started to really wrestle with the "antinomies," intended a pretty broad criticism. Later individualists, like Tucker, began with a fairly simple critique, complaining only of the "four monopolies," but as time passed individualists like Tucker actually became more critical of capitalism, abandoning as impracticable some of the more laissez faire elements of their schemes. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 01:20, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I kept that one setence and added much more..."<i>After the first generation of American individualist anarchists had passed away, a philosophy arose to claim the influence of individualist anarchism. Whereas the traditional individualists adhere to an intrinsic labor theory of value that conflicts with an ability to profit, the anarcho-capitalists believe that the value of goods and labor are contingent upon the price agreement at which one is willing to part with a thing and the price at which one is willing to purchase that thing. The value of a thing, to anarcho-capitalists, is the eventual consensus of subjective value judgements and therefore ultimately subjective (see subjective theory of value). This theory opens the door for profit in wage labor since one could purchase an hour of labor for less than what that hour of labor produced if such a price is agreed upon by both parties. For traditional individualists, the proper price of labor is identical to the full amount that it produced, and hence, not contingent upon subjective valuations --what one hour of labor produces ought to be paid with what one hour of labor of someone else produces. This differences in theories of value fundamentally accounts for the different directions traditional individualist anarchism and anarcho-capitalism take in regard to both wages and ownership of land.</i>"..so you're full of it. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 03:17, 12 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Don't lie. Those are your words but that's not what I put in the article. I changed that and added more .."<i>Despite this disagreement over fundamentals, many of the conclusions of anarcho-capitalists and individualists were similar, due to the fact that both groups agreed that property distribution and control should ultimately fall to the level of the individual rather than to that of the state or society. As such, both anarcho-capitalists and traditional individualist anarchists advocate private ownership of property, though the private ownership advocated by individualists can only legitimately come about as the result of one's labor --since land was not produced it cannot legitimately be bought and sold in its raw form. However, vacant land may be put into use, with the fruits of one's labor being regarded the private property of a person. This position on land, in various forms, is also shared by some early American liberals. Further, both philosophies argued for a free market to determine the distribution of goods, though the traditional individualists tend to reject institutions such as interest, rent, and profit as being antithetical to a free market relations since they regard this to allow the receipt of income without labor. They maintain that this is made possible by state- backed restrictions on banking and currency issuance as well as by state-backed titles to raw land). The anarcho-capitalists also oppose restrictions on banking and currency issuance, but do not oppose purchase and sale of raw land (and therefore do not oppose profiting from rent of land).</i>"...so obviously you're full of it. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 03:13, 12 July 2005 (UTC)

<p>"In modern times there is much controvesy over the legitimacy of various claims to the tradition of individualism. Collectivists argue that individualism is another side of the anarchist coin which both traditions share, since individualists argued so passionately for worker autonomy and control, and that anarcho-capitalist interpretations of the individualist tradition are misleading at best. They also point to some evidence, such as Tucker's repeated referances to himself as a socialist, his stated rejection of capitalism, and his belief that capitalism interfered with the free-market, as compelling reasons to reject anarcho-capitalist claims to the individualist tradition."</p>
<dl>
<dd>Same thing here. I significantly changed that and added more.. "<i>There is often controvesy over the legitimacy of various claims to the tradition of individualism. Some collectivists argue that they share a common bond with individualist anarchists in their opposition to profit. They also point to the fact that some of the individualist anarchists, such as Tucker referred to himself as a "socialist," and explictly opposed capitalism. However, it must be made clear that though Tucker refers to himself as a socialist, he, like other individualist anarchists in the American tradition, dismisses the idea of society owning property as a collective, as do the anarcho-capitalists. His idea of socialism, rather, was concerned with individual control of the full fruits of one's labor (no deductions for profit). Anarcho-capitalists do not regard profit in wage labor to be diminishing an individual's control over his "full produce" but to be the actual exercise of that control if one who labors decides to trade away part of that produce in order to receive, in exchange, employment by another. Like traditional individualists such as Lysander Spooner acknowledge, they hold that the way to retain one's full produce is to be self-employed. However, while traditional individualists regard self-employment as a way to both make more money and help erode the profit-making capitalist system, anarcho-capitalists see it as an option for an individual to make more money and perpetuate the capitalist system by hiring employee labor for less than its full produce. Anarcho-capitalists do not deny the difference in their respective theories of value and the implications that follow from those; traditional individualist anarchists are well established to be opposed to capitalism. Anarcho-capitalists, however consider opposition to collectivism and advocacy of private property are essential aspects of the individualist tradition that establishes an essential link between traditional individualist anarchism and anarcho-capitalism.</i>"...so again you're full of it. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 03:13, 12 July 2005 (UTC)

<p>Of course not. Anarcho-capitalism has a natural relationship to individualism, but the reverse is not true. Obviously this is a topic which needs to be broached, and shouldn't be broached on a main subject page (as its of minor interest). What's needed isn't a comparative table (yuck), or a big uninterrupted splurge of text, but a rational organisation of the topic under sub-headings, and the chasing up of sources. Nice idea for an article, but the article is unreadable at the moment.

<p>Kev, why are you deleting the whole redone page. If you have a problem with it, there are specific sections for each topic so that you can modify the wording. This is blatant vandalism.

<dd>Wikipedia is one big edit war. I'm merely supporting the process. Consensus is the last thing Wikipedia needs. Consensus is stagnation. The incessant conflict of ideas is what's good about Wikipedia. Anyone who is against an edit war is against the very concept of Wikipedia. Whether the edit warring happens is fast and furious or in slow motion over the course of years, it amounts to the same thing. But there's a right way to "war" and a wrong way. The wrong way is to do wholesale reverts of several edits instead of modifying and discussing. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 22:38, 12 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Where <i>do</i> you look up ISSN numbers? I checked the WP article at "ISSN", and the link to the official ISSN site from there, but couldn't find any place to look up what periodical a particular number corresponds to, or its URL if any. WP has an automatic hyperlinking of ISBN numbers (for books) that gives lots of choices to look them up, but nothing similar that I know of for ISSNs of periodicals. I suppose one could paste the number into Google and hope that there's some reference to it in the publication's site that would be picked up there. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan*</a> 15:41, July 15, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well at least you've got enough sense to simply ask, many public libraries and university libraries have ISSN searches. The library of congress has one as well, but it only searches their online material since ISSN is not a library of congress catalog.

I'm sure there is a more comprehensive one somewhere, but I've never needed it. And actually you were right, a google search would work as well.

<dd>She says that he "sees the need for a theory that goes beyond the individualistic, non-holistic aspects of rights theory and utilitarianism."

<dd>Nobody ever said that utilitarianism or rights based morality was a <i>limit</i> for individualism, merely that they are one means by which some individualists justify themselves (and not the only ones). Further, she explicitly states, "Marshall seems to be reading some of his own individualist, moral-extensionist presuppositions". That entails that he has individualist, moral-extensionist presuppusitions. So, if he is an individualist and an anarchist, what does that make him? Come on, think of a good way squirm around and mold that meaning to your preconceptions. BTW, have you finally given up on Larry Gambone, or are you going to continue to apply your keen sense of delusion to all the evidence above? <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 15:48, 15 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I'm finished with the Gambone thing. He says that Rothbard endorses anarchism. The system that Rothbard endorses is anarcho-capitalism. Case closed. No need to even go into your claim that Gambone is an individualist anarchist. Now on to the Marshall thing. Just because someone has some "individualist presuppositions" doesn't make one an individualist anarchists. Many "collectivist" anarchists aren't entirely collectivist unless they're purists, but primarily collectivist. Does Marshall support private property and markets? That's the kind of individualist anarchism this article is talking about. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 15:58, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Both philosophies favor individual private property including capital. However, individualist anarchists opposed titles to unused land, and income from the lending of capital, since that would be income without labor.</li>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Both individualist anarchists and anarcho-capitalists advocate "free banking" where any individual or group of individualists would be allowed to create and lend private currency. Traditional individualist anarchists, however, believe this would eventually lead to the inability to make a profit through lending due to competitive pressures.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Anarcho-capitalists have no ethical objection to wages being diminished by a profit allowance if both parties agree to such an arrangement. Individualist anarchists regard profit being deducted from wages as exploitative, but oppose forcibly intervening in such a contract.</li>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<li>Both individualist anarchists and anarcho-capitalists advocate private "defense associations" and private courts, though they disagree on some aspects of their jurisdiction.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The individualist anarchists tended to consider "<a href="../../../u/s/u/Usury.html" title="Usury">usury</a>" (i.e., profits from labor, rent, or interest) to be an unjust source of income made possible by government-backed monopolies. Interestingly, Tucker eventually argued that usury was possible even in the absence of the state, if vast concentrations of wealth had been accumulated due to government-backed monopolies. Anarcho-capitalists believe that profit earned through consentual interactions are permissible, and generally praiseworthy.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Source requested for Kev's claim regarind Gambone and anarcho-capitalism</span></h2>
<p>Kev, you say that Gambone does not regard anarcho-capitalism as indivualist anarchism. The quote your provided earlier was "For anarchists, capitalism is the result of the development of the state and therefore, all capitalism is in one sense, state capitalism." Where do you see anarcho-capitalism in that? What he's saying is that anarchists use the term "capitalism" in the sense of state capitalism. He says nothing of anarcho-capitalism. If you read his writings he usually refers to capitalism as "state capitalism," presumably precisely to avoid the confusion between stateless capitalism and state capitalism. Do you have any other source? That one clearly does not hold up. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 22:52, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Of course it holds up. He is stating that for anarchists all capitalism is state capitalism. That is a direct attack on the concept of anarcho-capitalism. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 08:33, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I found this from Gambone which further explains his point: " I am a classical anarchist, although I have a great deal of respect for Free Market Libertarians. (hereafter FML's) One difference has to do with the definition of capitalism. When Proudhon, the first anarchist theorist, coined the term, he applied it to those who had gained wealth from the use of governmental power or from privileges granted by government. Most of our FML friends, tend to regard capitalism the way Marxists do - they regard the essence of capitalism as exchange. Hence, anarchists are for free exchange but against capitalism and most FML's are for free exchange which they call capitalism, while at the same time they are opposed to government aided business - which they call mercantilism." My note: He's referring to modern libertarians as FML's, and he's right that classic anarchists used the term "capitalism" to refer to state-backed privilege rather than a free market situation. So, I'd say your using this guy as a source is a dead end. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 04:35, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Regardless of how the term is generally used, it fact remains that he stated explicitly that for anarchists all capitalism is state capitalism. Again, you can ignore this evidence if you want, but removing it in an attempt to bias the article is pretty low. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 08:33, 9 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>If it helps for you to understand, he was responding to a letter to him that said "Are you an anarchist or a libertarian? Although they mean essentially the same thing, here in the USA they fall on different end of the political spectrum. Anarchists would be considered ultra-left wing and libertarians definitely ultra-right wing. Libertarian ideas are very prevalent among business people here. They are pro-capitalist, meaning that they advocate the idea of unfettered capitalism...." One can definitely not conclude that he thinks anarcho-capitalism as anarcho-capitalists define capitalism as being incompatible with anarchism. He's making it clear that he opposes capitalism as traditional anarchists define it...which is state capitalism. He's making a very good point. The 19th century individualist anarchists also defined it that way. If you notice that whenever Tucker talks about capitalists he's explicitly talking about people that are working with the government to get favors. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 14:01, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm merely reinserting a previously written statement. It looks to me as though it is indicating that anarcho-capitalism arose after the first generation of american individualists had passed away, and after anarchism had split from Proudhon between the individualist tradition and the collectivist tradition. I would assume it is refering to Tucker and Bakunin, but I dunno for sure. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevkat_3df8.html" title="User:Revkat">Revkat</a> 17:27, 8 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>..."after anarchism had split from Proudhon between the individualist tradition and the collectivist tradition." This is what doesn't make sense. It's horribly written whatever it's trying to say. <i>Anarchism</i> didn't split from Proudhon. Proudhon *was* an anarchist --an individualist anarchist. Some individuals, including Proudhonians, rebelled against Proudhon's support of private property and a market economy --and developed anarcho-communism. I have to delete the sentence ..it defies understanding. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 17:34, 8 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The individualist tradition as it stands today did not begin with Proudhon, it followed him. To call him an individualist comes from subsequent reading of him and comparing him to those who described themselves as individualists and followed from him. Some might read the individualists as closer to Proudhon than the collectivists, but that is a subjective call and not something to base wikipedia on. The fact is that both traditions claim him, both claims are legitimate in that each tradition borrowed some stuff while rejecting others, and thus it is perfectly reasonable to conclude that after Proudhon there was a split in anarchism. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevkat_3df8.html" title="User:Revkat">Revkat</a> 17:54, 8 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Whatever. Even if that is true, this statement makes no sense: "anarchism split from Proudhon." Anarchism did NOT split from Proudhon. Proudhon WAS an anarchist. SOME ANARCHISTS split from Proudhon, but anarchism itself didn't split from Proudhon. The sentence defies logic. But, even if that is fixed, what it the point of the statement? Why is there? What does that have to do with individualist anarchism and anarcho-capitalism? It's bizarre. 18:29, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"It has been difficult for many to actually accept that such capitalists may actually oppose the state since they do not in any way participate in opposing corporations and state corporate-welfare in protests or direct action." This is a false statement. This is from the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalism</a> article: "<i>One social structure that is not permissible under anarcho-capitalism is one that attempts to claim greater sovereignty than the individuals that form it. The state is a prime example, but another is the modern corporation — defined as a legal entity that exists under a different legal code than individuals as a means to shelter the individuals who own and run the corporation from possible legal consequences of acts by the corporation. It is worth noting that Rothbard allows a narrower definition of a corporation: "Corporations are not at all monopolistic privileges; they are free associations of individuals pooling their capital. On the purely free market, such men would simply announce to their creditors that their liability is limited to the capital specifically invested in the corporation [...]."[13] However, this is a very narrow definition that only shelters owners from debt by creditors that specifically agree to the arrangement; it also does not shelter other liability, such as from malfeasance or other wrongdoing.</i>" Also, anarcho-capitalists indeed oppose corporate welfare. And the stuff about cowboys and pirates being examples of individualist anarchists that oppose private property is just bizarre.
