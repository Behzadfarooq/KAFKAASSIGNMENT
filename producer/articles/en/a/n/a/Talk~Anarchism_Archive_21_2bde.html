<h2><span class="mw-headline">Immediate Action Required</span></h2>
<p>This dispute has gone on for far too long. The information gathered in this discussion showed that the article has been left at the socialist point of view or that information on anarcho-capitalism should not be on this article and other similar complaints. To whoever has the authority: Remove the Protection Tag; the Two Versions Tag; and after experts on the subject have corrected and added information to this article, the Neutrality Tag must also be removed, which should then be replaced by the Controversial Issue Tag if needed. Any available experts on the subject should monitor the article daily and correct any false, outdated, or one-sided information as soon as possible. This is the best method for ending the dispute and it must be carried out within a week at the most.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">No Reason for Debate</span></h2>
<p>This entry has been the subject of edit wars for some time. It's time for the so-called "anarcho-capitalists" to stick to their own page and leave this entry alone. Anarcho-capitalism has never been a part of anarchism and it is simply factually incorrect for this entry to treat anarcho-capitalism with any seriousness. The Anarchist FAQ has throroughly debunked anarcho-capitalism as an ideology. Just because a few misguided individuals sabotage this entry with their nonsense about anarcho-capitalism doesn't mean that Wikipedia should allow false information to be posted as a live entry. People can check any anthology of anarchist writings at your library and find nothing about anarcho-capitalism. It has nothing to do with anarchism. There is no need to qualify anarchism as consisting of "left anarchism" vs. "anarcho-capitalism." Please get the correct version of this article online without the section about anarcho-capitalism. A link to the anarcho-capitalism section would be understandable, but a section in this version on anarcho-capitalism is simply inaccurate. -- Chuck0, Infoshop.org and Radical Reference</p>

<dd>Is anyone else disturbed by RJII's "edit wars are good" theory? Seems pretty clear he's just here to cause trouble. Gave up arguing rationally about two weeks ago. Oh well. If worse comes to worst, I'm sure I have more free time than you and thus have the edge in a <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_of_attrition.html" title="War of attrition">war of attrition</a>&#160;:P But I assure you I'll do anything to avoid this course. --<a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETothebarricades.tk_2bb0.html" title="User:Tothebarricades.tk">Tothebarricades</a> 19:43, Jun 21, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not here to "cause trouble" at all. I'm here to help correct the article. If that's troubling to you, that's unfortunate. Either way, whether it's interminable debate, or endless editing, there will be no resolution. There will always be anarchists who think somebody else's school of anarchism is not real anarchism (as in the traditional individualists who held that communist and syndicalist forms were not anarchism). So, the best we can do is edit endlessly without resolution. A dynamic article is better than a stagnant one. The point of Wikipedia is not for writers to appease other, but to provide dynamic, living articles, that anyone can edit. I, for one, will not the sacrifice quality and accuracy of an article for the sake of avoiding conflict or avoiding "causing trouble." If anyone would, then they shouldn't be editing an article. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 20:23, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I wanted it unprotected too, until I saw the capitalists want it unproctected as well, now I'm not so sure. Keep it protected because they'll surely go back to their vandalistic ways.

<dd>Well argument is the stuff of life - I have no problem discussing, collaborating with other wikipedians on this. But on this page for the last few months we have had the same 2 or 3 anarcho-capitalists pushing their POV and UNPROVEN claim that A/C is entered in the article as a 'school' or substantial subsection. Folk coming in have only really experienced this and little discussion on the other parts of the article. IMHO it is classic trolling as A/C's are abusive.,.. uncooperative and just go on POV rants without refering to unbias sources or evidence. -<a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMax_rspct_e7d2.html" title="User:Max rspct">max rspct</a> 22:37, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If integrity mattered, the <a href="../../../g/i/f/Gift_economy.html" title="Gift economy">gift economy theory</a>, would be a little more fleshed out. As it stands now, it is little more than a mantra. I suspect most participants in the anti-globalist movement are just exploiting an excuse to misbehave and enjoy a sense of belonging to a counter-culture, but there should still be some constructive thinkers able to contribute to gift economy theory, so that it can be subjected to critical analysis. There is not enough there to shake a stick at, nonetheless call an "economy".--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 02:26, Jun 22, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That is one thing we can agree on, I doubt any of us would be interested in anarchism if it was. The question is, are some anarchists intending a society that can only exist if all dissent is coercively purged, or has high levels of social ostracism. Many who think they would be the ones to survive the purge, may be like the vietcong dupes who thought they were fighting for something noble and ended up getting re-education camps, or worse.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 03:02, Jun 22, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I agree with Juanco. Let's go back to the following Neutral Disambiguation Page and avoid edit wars.</p>
<p><b>Anarchism</b> is derived from the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_language.html" title="Greek language">Greek</a> <i><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%B1%CF%81%CF%87%CE%AF%CE%B1" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:αναρχία">αναρχία</a></i> ("without <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archon.html" title="Archon">archons</a> (rulers)"). Thus "anarchism," in its most general meaning, is the philosophy or belief that rulership is unnecessary and should be abolished. For other usages, see <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Anarchism (disambiguation)">anarchism (disambiguation)</a>.</p>
<p><b>Anarchism</b> may mean:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_%28anti-state%29.html" title="Anarchism (anti-state)">Anarchism (anti-state)</a> - the theory or doctrine that all forms of government are unnecessary, oppressive, and undesirable and should be abolished.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_%28socialist%29.html" title="Anarchism (socialist)">Anarchism (socialist)</a> - philosophies, movements, and ideologies that advocate the abolition of capitalist exploitation and all other forms of authority.</li>

<dd>Get real, Max. The anarcho-socialists are just as intransigent. They too refuse to budge an inch on the definition of anarchism, and denigrate all objective sources such as dictionaries and even the words of their own luminaries. What you're really saying is that the anarcho-socialist clique temporarily had control of the article until people with a different point of view showed up again.</dd>

<dd>What individualist anarchist section? There isn't one. It isn't included as a school of anarchism. It's just mentioned in the internal conflicts section.

<p><b>LOOK</b> = Individualism vs. collectivism:<br />
<i>While most anarchists favor collective property, some, such as individualist anarchists of historical note support a right to private property. These include Benjamin Tucker and Lysander Spooner. Tucker argues that collectivism in property is absurd: "That there is an entity known as the community which is the rightful owner of all land, Anarchists deny...I...maintain that ‘the community’ is a non-entity, that it has no existence..." He was particularly adamant in his opposition to "communism," even to the point of asserting that those who opposed a right to private property were not anarchists: "Anarchism is a word without meaning, unless it includes the liberty of the individual to control his product or whatever his product has brought him through exchange in a free market—that is, private property. Whoever denies private property is of necessity an Archist." However, these individuals opposed property titles to unused land.</i></p>

<dd>Exactly. I'm the one who wrote that section in "Internal conflicts" since the POV collectivists anarchists didn't want individualist anarchism included as a school of anarchism.

<p>Hogeye/others, since you seem to have admitted the following: 1) There are multiple definitions of anarchism (as is evident by your forking) 2) You wish to avoid an edit war&#160;; on what grounds can you continue to oppose pointing the reader to anarcho-capitalism by means of a disambiguation note? <b>It is standard policy to do this if one meaning is more notable.</b> That anarcho-capitalism is less notable than what you call "<a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_%28socialist%29.html" title="Anarchism (socialist)">Anarchism (socialist)</a>" is clear, no argument necessary.</p>

<dd>It appears that the goal of this capitalist POV war is not to present their "anarcho-capitalist" "philosophy" in an acceptable, NPOV manner; but rather to dilute the definition of anarchism to the point where it loses all coherence and connection with anarchist tradition and history. It is reactionary in the extreme and not at all benign. For that reason alone I'm not comfortable with the "Anarchism (socialist)" nonsense.

<dd>"...or the narrower popular definition." - Unfortunately for you, Wikipedia <i>always</i> uses the "narrower popular definition" in favor of dictionary definitions (especially when most people would equate the two, since seeing capitalism as "cooperative" is a little off the wall).

<dd>I'm saying that an overall anarchism article is different from an article about anarcho-capitalism. Obviously. In free-market capitalism, any interaction between two people must be voluntary, and every trade mutually beneficial ex ante. That's cooperation. One man, one veto. That's <i>much</i> more cooperative than majoritarian-ruled communes.

<dd>Your dicdef is false due to selection bias. The "web" dictionaries you suggested on the fork VFD were of very poor quality. Additionally they were predominantly English-US. Pocket dictionaries are entirely unsuitable to resolve this issue. Additionally, most dictionaries you cite are poor in terms of contemporary usage. OED3 anarchy 1b is the most useful head for us, being "A theoretical social state in which there is no governing person or body of persons, but each individual has absolute liberty (without implication of disorder)." whose usage "1892 Daily News 27 Apr. 5/8 Anarchy means the placing in common of all this world's riches to allow each to consume according to his needs. Anarchy is a great family where each will be protected by all and will take whatever he requires." clearly indicates the common usage of anarchy to present a social state with no government and no disorder (OED3 headword: Anarchy, def 1b, usage 1892 Daily News). Compare, if we shall, to anarcho-capitalism (first use 1969) and particularly anarcho-capitalist (first use 1969, usage, "1969 Libertarian 15 May 3/1 The great majority of revolutionary anarcho-capitalists are highly enthusiastic about the Black Panthers and their potential for leading a black liberation movement." (OED3). These somewhat confused neologisms, whose usage has varied so greatly between 1969 and today that the prior sees the eager support of the Black Panthers and the contemporary sees the worship of the oligarchs of private government (or capitalists, for when money speaks with its iron tongue, that is a form of govern-ing). OED3, due to its etymological concern, acts as a very solid dictionary of international English. Anarcho-capitalism, being a usage strongly at odds with the chief social usage of anarchy in English, being, "the placing in common of all this world's riches to allow each to consume according to his needs," AND, as the smaller social movement, AND, as the more recent social movement, should be disambiguated on a seperate page. It is gross cultural imperialism to subsume international English behind the petty English of US college campuses, simply to tar the article with a brush whose colour you detest. <a href="../../../f/i/f/User%7EFifelfoo_12d0.html" title="User:Fifelfoo">Fifelfoo</a> 23:29, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Even your cherry-picked definition does not rule out capitalism. Anarcho-capitalism is definitely a theoretical social state in which there is no governing person or body of persons, but each individual has absolute liberty. Thank you. We can add one more dictionary which agrees that anarchism is anti-statist but not necessarily anti-capitalist.

<dd>You might try reading an introduction to a definitive etymological dictionary, like OED sometime. Usage is meaning, and the collection of distinctive and widespread usages is a key function of an etymological dictionary. Compilers of etymological dictionaries create definitions through analysis of first usages*, thus meaning that usage is very important. Usages prior to 1892 include solid references to the Narodniki's collectivism, Proudhon in his mutualist moment**, and prior to that, the sainted Godwin. Obviously one may make a case for Godwin's usage; whereas it is difficult to bend mutualism into the ultra-propertarian definition of anarcho-capitalism, let alone the peasant-communalism of the narodniks. [*first usages are important because they indicate the time that a usage became common, current or unique from other usages. Second usages are less important. **While Proudhon supported the interchange of possession in his mutualism, its stringing Odysseus' bow to claim that his mutualism is compatible with the freedom of private property declared by anarcho-capitalists.] <a href="../../../f/i/f/User%7EFifelfoo_12d0.html" title="User:Fifelfoo">Fifelfoo</a> 00:04, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Bottom line: The definition that you cited supports the <i>anarchism qua anti-statism</i> position. Your appeal to etymology is laughable, since anarchism comes from Greek meaning "without ruler", i.e. without a State. Perhaps you should look a little earlier than 1892 for 'first use.' LOL. BTW, I've already cited Proudhon's first use in 1840 in "What is Property." His def also agrees with the broad tent definition.</dd>

<dd>I oppose that because "Anarchism" is commonly regarded as referring to theory. It's <i>this</i> article that needs to deal with the various philosophical positions. If anyone wants to talk about a so-called "social movement" of collectivist anarchists, then that's why you would need another article with an alternative name. Anarchism is commonly thought of, first and foremost, as a set of philosophical positions. We shouldn't let a few POV'ers corrupt the meaning of the term to mean a "social movement" (by social movement I take it that they mean people demonstrating in the streets and/or throwing bombs) which necessarily consists only of collectivists anarchists, and necessarily excludes individualist anarchism and anarcho-capitalism. That's highly non-standard, and "original research." <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 00:08, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>CNT? FAI? Nabatniki? Who died at Genoa? Who made Prague into a good showing or a bloody nightmare (depending on your political views)? Who was blamed over Seattle? Who fought the German police in the 1980s? Who died at Haymarket? Anarchism's common usage refers to a social movement. Even within academic disciplinary political studies (three disciplines to mention: Politics, Political Economy and Social History), anarchism refers to a myasma of theory only in the first*, and to a social movement in the two second. [*The obvious critique of the disciplinary methods of politics in the West needs not to be given, the methodological presumptions against engaging social movements is obvious.

<dd>Encyclopedia Britannica says anarchism is "a cluster of doctrines and attitudes centred on the belief that government is both harmful and unnecessary." If that widely-disemminated and popular dictionary does not give the most common understanding of what is meant by "anarchism" then I don't know what does. Anarchism is most commonly regarded as referring to IDEAS ..PHILOSOPHY. Anarchism is philosophy.

<dd>Britannica is not a dicationary. Nor is any encyclopedia considered to be of sufficient quality to base any assertion and substantiate it*. Encyclopedia are created with reference to primary sources, and secondary sources of disciplinary qualities, not by reference to other encyclopedia*.

[*Obvious exception: assertions and encyclopedia entries directly related to encyclopedia as a topic.]
<dl>
<dd>A riot in Genoa has absolutely no influence on what anarchism means. A riot is a riot. A riot of anarchists is a riot of anarchists. Rioting itself is not anarchism.

<dd>If anyone, including any mediator, wants to see my positions they can in these discussion pages. I'm not going to rehash everything to a mediator. All this debate is getting really pointless. Actually, there may be a point to it. The point is to drag this out interminably and keep the biased article protected from being edited as long as possible isn't it? Wikipedia policy says that pages should not be protected "very long." This page has been protected for "very long." The protection, at this point, has become a violation of Wikipedia policy, and if not POV motivated, surely gives the outward appearance of a POV-motivated lockdown designed to keep a biased article from being neutralized. Wikipedia is supposed to be a place where anyone can edit an article. After this length of time, this lockdown is contrary to the spirit of Wikipedia. I refuse to take part in prolonging the lockdown, here or in mediation. If, and when, the article is unlocked, then I'll be back to edit it.<a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 22:34, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am really really tired of this debate. I started out editing anarchism on wikipedia because it was immediately the topic that interested me. However, I find myself devoting most if not all of my internet time to this article, when I would really like to be working on other articles. I don't want the article protected forever, either, but it's not going to get unprotected until we can work this out. Also, even if you are not with the Libertarian party per se, your admission of association (Hogeye) still shows that we have two unreconcilable POV's to work out. Mine and yours. How does it affect the definition of anarchism? I don't see why you're opposed to mediation...it's just part of the wikipedia process--it's not like they will TELL us what to do. Are you afraid of mediation because you are willfully making false claims, claims that you know to be false, only for propagandistic purposes? Only zealots ignore what they know to be true in order to promate what they want to be true -- if you are not a zealot, and truly believe in your own arguments, why not enter into mediation? If you claim to represent truth, then what do you have to lose? --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbamuth_eea6.html" title="User:Albamuth">albamuth</a> 08:57, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>mediation is often more about compromise than truth, although perhaps it will do a better job of achieving balance than the various polls and RfCs to, which are even less about truth, but if the mediation isn't binding, what progress have we made? Not only has the mediation process been inactive for months, I doubt it's decisions would be respected here. The text of your request for mediation, was a distortion, and a dismissal of the positions you disagree with, just as your poll questions on the issues were. The lack of intellectual honesty which makes mediation necessary, probably also makes it doomed to fail.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 09:21, Jun 26, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Question:</b> In 50 words, more or less, what do you object to, in the article in its present protected state?</p>
<p><b>Answers:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>It's protected, I think protected articles are contrary to wikipedian principles. <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedant_30ce.html" title="User:Pedant">Pedant</a> 21:06, 2005 Jun 25 (UTC)</li>
<li>The POV definition of anarchism. All other objections follow from that. E.g. the omission of various schools, mischaracterization of what anarchists think/believe. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 22:39, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>That it's an article about one particular meaning of anarchism, referring to a specifically anti-capitalist movement, rather than about the broad range of philosophies that can be considered anarchist under a more inclusive definition. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan*</a> 01:17, Jun 26, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Its dissimilarity w articles on the topic which can be found elsewhere, and that this dissimilarity is based on a wikipedian socialist POV lobby, rather than more balanced references than other sources. This article is proof of failings of both the wiki ideals and anarchism. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">¸,ø¤º°`°º¤ø,¸</a><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESam_Spade_3418.html" title="User talk:Sam Spade">¸,ø¤º°`°º¤ø,¸</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Emailuser&amp;target=Sam_Spade" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Emailuser&amp;target=Sam_Spade" rel="nofollow">¸,ø¤º°`°º¤ø,¸</a> 01:23, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The article is not balanced between the two main schools of anarchism, the individualist and the collectivist with prominent mention of anarcho-capitalism in the individualist camp. This lack of balance gives the impression that the well written history and origins of anarchism are "owned" by the collectivist school. The lack of recognition of this primary divide between the individualist and collectivists, does not provide a proper location for the key issues that divide them. Is property coercive and is collectivism (which seems to require some kind of enforcement) coercive? --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 06:46, Jun 26, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>It could use some polish here and there, but basicly it's a good article written in a neutral style. Considering how many different branches of anarchism there are it does a good job covering them all. // <a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELiftarn_fddd.html" title="User:Liftarn">Liftarn</a></li>
<li>I have no problems with the range of topics it covers, but would rather that anarchism be presented via <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolutionary_epistemology.html" title="Evolutionary epistemology">evolutionary epistemology</a>, to show the development and addition of ideas. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbamuth_eea6.html" title="User:Albamuth">albamuth</a> 18:36, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>So you don't mind discussing the evolution of anti-statist liberalism into anarchism (e.g. Bastiat, Molinari,) and the evolution of socialist anarchism into anarcho-capitalism in the 20th century? <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 28 June 2005 14:19 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Just like in evolution, some branches of the meme-pool are dead-ends, and never become a permanent part of it. Unlike biological evolution, influences and sources for the ideas (memes) can be positive, negative (as a reaction against), or even complementary (parallel but not conflicting concepts). For the article, it is not necessary to list every author that influenced anarchist writers (even Isaac Newton would be mentioned), but those authors that framed the concepts that the anarchist movement inculcated and retained. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbamuth_eea6.html" title="User:Albamuth">albamuth</a> 29 June 2005 03:34 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, what you call "socialist anarchism" never developed into "anarcho-capitalism." To delineate direct relation of one writer's ideas to another, you have to look at whom they cite and refer to. In the absence of citation (original research), you must see if that writer's ideas became part of the memeplex for what we are describing (anarchism). Does Rothbard draw on the tradition of previous anarchist writers? Is there a movement that follows his ideas? If they call themselves anarcho-capitalists, but no anarchists follow those ideas, then it is fair to say that the anacho-capitalist movement follows Rothbard's ideas and that anarchists do not. Therefore, an article about a social movement that expouses a political philosophy called anarchism need not mention Rothbard, but an article about anarcho-capitalism should. Theory: if in <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a> speciation occurs when two segments of a population become so differentiated that they cannot breed together, then in <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_philosophy.html" title="Political philosophy">political philosophy</a> speciation occurs when two segments of a social movement become so at odds that they cannot purposefully collaborate/agree (take the SWP and the IWW, for example). Caveat: ideologies are not species and memes are not genes, therefore their origination and evolution is not fully analogous. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbamuth_eea6.html" title="User:Albamuth">albamuth</a> 29 June 2005 04:17 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It looks to me like Godwin, and even Proudhon to some degree, evolved from classical liberalism. Anti-statist liberalism, Proudhon's mutualism, and Bakunin's socialism are all strains of anarchism. Tucker took some of Bakunin's exploitation theory, and a lot of Herbert Spencer's moral theory, mixed in some Ayn Rand, I mean Max Stirner egoism, creating individualist anarchism. Later, Rothbard synthesized individualist anarchism and Austrian economics to get modern anarcho-capitalism. Your focus, Alba, on only one strain exposes your biased POV. At any rate, it's clear that a history-only article would not break the impasse. It just reframes the issue from "what is the definition of anarchism" to "what should be included in the history of anarchism." <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 29 June 2005 07:21 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Why the current article is far superior to the one being pushed by POV warriors</span></h2>
<p>In particular problems include: (1) the template, which is skewed to over-emphasize anarcho-capitalism and indicates not only that anarcho-capitalism is a form of anarchism (which is a point of contention), but that it is a form of individualism (which is another point of contention) (2) Its claim to take no point of view on which philosophies are a form of anarchism, when in fact the forms of categories it displays and its presentation is biased to the anarcho-capitalist position that they are a form of anarchism. (3) its timeline, which labels someone who never considered himself an anarcho-capitalist as such, and falsely labels bakunin the first anarcho-socialist when many consider mutualism to be a form of socialism, (4) its inclusion of Molinari in the development of modern anarchism, when in fact molinari was not identified with the anarchist movement until the anarcho-capitalists came about 100 years later and revisited history to claim him, (5) its political chart, which is blatantly AC pov that puts Tucker and Proudhon inbetween socialism and capitalism despite the fact that Tucker called himself a socialist, and implies that anarcho-capitalism is in fact a form of anarchism or that capitalism is compatible with anarchism, two claims that defy the history of anarchism and are under contention, (5) its claim that individualist feminism is a form of anarchism, when in fact many individualist feminists are not anarchists, (6) its inclusion of anarcho-capitalism in "schools of anarchism", when it should be placed separately, (7) its heavily biased individualist anarchist section, which along with the individualist anarchism article have been under the control of anarcho-capitalists of late, (8) its "anarchist schools chart", which oversimplifies and misrepresents aspects of both collectivist anarchism (most do not believe in crime) and individualist anarchism (their support of both land and property is qualified, and it is not neutral to claim that this answer is either simpy "yes" or "no", further, Tucker did believe in expropriation in certain instances), (9) the ridiculous contention that anarchists support polycentric law, part of the problem of including anarcho-capitalism outside its own section which misrepresents anarchism as a whole in order to cater to a small sub-movement hostile to anarchist tradition, (10) the ludicrious claim that the "capitalism vs. socialism" is the most controversial conflict between anarchists, when in fact anarchists by and large ignore anarcho-capitalism as an irrelevant attempt to subvert their tradition, further, the presentation in that section is obviously from AC pov (11) the linking of Tucker with panarchism, (12) the inclusion of several sections dealing specifically with AC perspectives, which are already detailed in their article and over-emphasize a relatively small movement, (13) its inclusion of an entire section dedicated to anarcho-capitalist books, which would be as silly as putting such a section in there for all possible anarchist sub-movements and claimaints, and again over-emphasizes anarcho-capitalism, (14) the general tone and direction of the article, whose main purpose is so obviously to emphasize the personally favored philosophy of its editors that it would be hard for them to deny without appearing to be either total idiots or complete ideologues.</p>
<p>For all of these reasons I will not accept any attempt to overwrite the current article, the product of years of work, with this heavily POV anarcho-capitalist replacement. Now will I stand by as such a highly biased piece of writing is used to try to alter the current article which is -more- than fair to this particular sub-movement given its standing in regards to traditional anarchism. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 30 June 2005 03:54 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Most of Kev's points are redundant, i.e. are simply different formulations of the core definitional dispute: 1,2,6,10,12,13, and 14.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(3) and (4) Kev makes the error of ignoring the definition of anarchism and ignoring ideas closely related to anarchism (anti-state liberalism), with the flimsy excuse that so-and-so did not <i>self-refer</i> as an anarchist. Strangely, Kev doesn't mind that William Godwin never refered to himself as an anarchist, but he <i>does</i> mind Molinari. POV? You make the call.
<dl>
<dd>I don't ignore the definintion of anarchism, I just refuse to select out only those bits and pieces that support my theory. I do think that ideas which are closely related to <i>anarchism</i> rather than ideas which are closely related to "some sub-movement within anarchism" should in fact be present in a history of <i>anarchism</i> that is not actually a history of "some sub-movement within anarchism". I find that logical, you seem to think it is POV. As for Godwin, which sub-movement rejects him? If there is one, I would agree that he should not be included in the broader history. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 3 July 2005 19:10 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(5) By the modern definition of socialism and capitalism, Proudhon (and mutualists in general) have some similarities and dissimilarities to each. See the chart comparing anarcho-socialism to individualist anarchism to anarcho-capitalism. Clearly, mutualism is somewhere between socialism and capitalism, with some features of each.
<dl>
<dd>Saying that it is "somewhere between" capitalism and socialism assumes that you reject the definition of socialism used by some mutualists, and also does not tell you where it is between those two movements. Oddly, your overly-simplistic chart tells us <i>exactly</i> where it lies, without telling us why. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 3 July 2005 19:10 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(7) Kev has a history of trying to put a detailed individualist anarchism article within other articles, rather than a few essentials and a link to IA.
<dl>
<dd>Nah, I have a history of not allowing anarcho-capitalists to claim ties with individualism without stating the whole case. I don't like how you folks tend to only include those rare instances in which they agree with you, while purposely censoring those numerous instances in which they flat out reject your economics. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 3 July 2005 19:10 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(8) Kev makes the ridiculous claim that most collectivist anarchists "do not believe in crime." Let's check the veracity of that claim:</dd>
<dd>"Powerful states can maintain themselves only by crime, little states are virtuous only by weakness." - Bakunin</dd>
<dd>"Have not prisons - which kill all will and force of character in man, which enclose within their walls more vices than are met with on any other spot of the globe - always been universities of crime?" - Kropotkin</dd>
<dd>Maybe Kev meant that most bald punkers with circle-A tatoos believe that. I dunno.
<dl>
<dd>Have you ever heard of modern anarchism? You know, if I took your standards and assumed that only the early historical anarchists spoke for the modern movment, then I would be forced to blank the anarcho-capitalism article altogether. I do, however, appreciate your constant attempts to reduce the level of conversation with insults and antagonism. For that reason I'm going to have to stop taking you seriously anymore Hogeye, though you do have to admit I hung in their a long time while you threw abuse about. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 3 July 2005 19:10 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(9) Kev: "...the ridiculous contention that anarchists support polycentric law."</dd>
<dd>Kev must have misread. The article reads, "While some anarchists reject organized defense of liberty outright, many have proposed forms of polycentric law."
<dl>
<dd>That sentence says that some anarchists support polycentric law. The only <i>anarchists</i> who support polycentric law are anarcho-capitalists, and whether or not they are actually anarchists is a matter of ones POV, not an appropriate thing to assume for the reader. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 3 July 2005 19:10 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(11) Kev: "the linking of Tucker with panarchism"</dd>
<dd>Again, a misreading of the article. It does not link Tucker with panarchism at all. It links Tucker with tolerance. E.g. Tucker's article in Liberty praising Auberon Herbert as an anarchist. Herbert was pro-capitalism by the way.
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, I read that article, and I found your RJ's assumptions, which were the same as yours, in regards to it to be faulty. I can't remember whether I already responded to him at the anarcho-capitalist discussion or the individualist anarchist one. Maybe you could cite it here? As I recall, Tucker refered to Herbert's ideas of having the essence of anarchy, he did not actually refer to Herbert himself as being an anarchist. You do know that indviduals can have ideas related to anarchism without actually being anarchists, right? <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 3 July 2005 19:10 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As it happens, I agree with most of Kev's criticisms. Vis a vis 4) Molinari could readily be included and be described as a "close predecessor" of pro-capitalism anarchists. I don't necessarily agree with 7), as Kev has his own POV when it comes to "bias" on individualist anarchism. Regarding 8), I wonder whether it is really a good idea to continue thinking of "individualist anarchism" exclusively in terms of Tucker; are there really no other individualists worth citing? I'm also not sure about 11) (I really have no idea), and 14) is entirely a judgment call. - <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Kraus</a><a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">e</a> 30 June 2005 04:37 (UTC)

<dd>As I explained above, I don't think precursors of any faction should be included in the general history. First, because they are only precursors of particular factions and this is a general history, they can all be put on their own pages. Second, because these claims tend to be controversial. Third, because it would overload the history with a lot of factional speculation and inevitably lead to edit wars. If we must include some precursors in the history, and we might as well, they should be ones for anarchism in general, rather than any claimed by only one or two factions. Other than that, only people who actually refered to themselves as anarchists should be in the history.</dd>

<dd>I do have my own bias when it comes to individualism, my bias is that their works not be misrepresented to make it appear that they supported things that they in fact rejected wholesale. I believe in staying true to their memory, I find it distrubing that people can claim their tradition while at the same time ignoring it. I agree that Tucker should not be the sole indicator of individualism, but neither should sweeping statements about individualism be made when they disagree with the views of any particular individualist. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 1 July 2005 17:18 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't use the term "left-anarchism," since <i>all</i> anarchism, including anarcho-capitalism, is left - i.e. opposes the <i>ancien regime</i> aka the existing State.

<p>does it strike anyone as funny that a straightforward definition of anarchism is taking longer than 3 years to hammer out? Wikipedia is by its very nature anarchist, so this seems to me to point out some reasons why anarchism and a strict adherence to consensus process work best on a small scale. Anarchists, if you want to show that anarchism works, lets get it together and move forward on this article.<a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedant_30ce.html" title="User:Pedant">Pedant</a> 2005 June 30 19:13 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This has demonstrated the instability and hopelessness of collective ownership - that's for sure. It's pretty clear that the Wiki article on anarchism will never have the quality of e.g. the privately owned <a href="http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/anarfaq.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/anarfaq.htm" rel="nofollow">Anarchist Theory FAQ</a>, simply due to the controversial nature of the topic. Private ownership, of course, solves problems such as this by providing clear jurisdiction. It took Josiah Warren two years at Robert Owens' utopian community to figure out that individualism and private property were <i>where it's at</i>. Here we've demonstrated the same thing in under a month! <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 30 June 2005 19:57 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd disagree. I'd suggest that it demonstrates only that, to survive, any community must have a way to prevent vandals from wreaking their will. There will always be a small group of anti-social people who gain enjoyment from destruction and the imposition of their will on others. That doesn't really impeach the idea of communal ownership at all. Communal ownership is voluntarily practiced by over 700M people throughout the world as of 1995--more than twice the population of the USA. And it works fine for us. If you want to see an example of communal ownership that has endured for at least 300 years, look back through the issues of National Geographic. You'll find an article about a communal irrigation and farming system in New Mexico. Every year the village allocates land, and on an agreed day everyone turns out to de-rubbish the canals. The elderly and infirm have their equal allotment, and the rest of the people take care of it for them as a matter of course. It's very nice. Many peoples living a pre-industrial life successfully practice communal ownership because the people around them depend for their lives, too, on mutual respect and talking things out. <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatzenjammer_c526.html" title="User:Katzenjammer">Katzenjammer</a> 1 July 2005 12:26 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are right, Katz, that remote desert aboriginals can make collective ownership work. Why will that work, but not Wiki collective ownership? Mainly due to the closed system and the common values. Probably a stranger to the culture would have great difficulty joining the tribe. In fact, very few outsiders <i>want</i> to participate in such primitive lifestyles, so the question rarely comes up. Similarly, the few successful utopian communities limited themselves to like-minded religious cultists, and were typically very stict on who could join.</dd>

Using your analogy, it's more accurate like this: the local community consensus agrees on one thing, and then a guy flies in from out of town, who doesn't even believe in consensus, and runs into the room screaming "I'm being excluded! I'm being censored! CONSENSUS!! INCLUDE ME!!!" essentially ruining the original consensus of a community they were never part of. It's like a republican coming into an anarchist festival and demanding that everyone adhere to their love for "america" and capitalism because they are personally offended by the black flags and revolutionary literature. I don't think I ever met an anarchist that believed consensus should be used on a scale of hundreds of millions. Consensus is something that supposed to be used in groups no bigger than a community or neighborhood, given that almost all decisions that are important can be made locally, when the need for larger opinion is needed, they don't negotiate in one larger meshing of the two, they decide what their collective decision is in their community and tell the other, and yes it makes a huge difference. To debate using consensus, you first have to actually believe in consensus, and to debate anarchism you have either be an anarchist or know what the fuck you're talking about and know about anarchism, two requirements that hogeye and the other vandals on here DO NOT HAVE. --<a href="../../../f/a/t/User%7EFatal_5ada.html" title="User:Fatal">Fatal</a> 30 June 2005 19:59 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's not a bad analogy, Fatal. It recalls the Puritans of Massachusetts in the 1600s. The local community consensus was no Sabbath-breaking, strict dress codes, puritanical codes of conduct and work, and that everyone should be a good Puritan. Occasionally a Quaker or Baptist would wander through. These heretics would be imprisoned, beaten, mutilated, or "whipped through town." This latter was popular - you remove the shirt of the Quaker (man or woman), tie them to the back of an ox-cart, and whip the shit out of them in every town on the way to the border. Then dump them in the atheist hell-hole of Rhode Island. Of course, in the virtual world, your whip is replaced by mere pixels on a screen. It's going to be hard to whip the blasphemers through town with mere pixels.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Responding to the RFC</span></h2>
<p>I'm a pro-social anarchist (and currently embroiled as such over in the misnamed 'libertarianism' page). I believe that the bare term 'anarchism', like the bare term 'libertarian', is too general to be colonized by any sectarian group. In other words, I see no reason why the pro-Capitalism sect can't have equal room under the anarchism umbrella. This implies that the 'anarchism' page itself be a pure portal/distributor/disambiguator page, and that each of the sects settle for having a page with a fully-qualified/disambiguated title.</p>
<p>I'm arguing that same position over at 'libertarianism', and plan to lodge an RFC on Monday as the first step in the conflict-resolution process. Since the pro-Capitalism forces are taking the same stand here that I am taking over there (I found that wonderfully ironic, needless to say), can we count on having your support for making that page, too, be a disambiguator rather than the highly partisan POVful page it is now? <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatzenjammer_c526.html" title="User:Katzenjammer">Katzenjammer</a> 1 July 2005 00:01 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can't speak for any of the other pro-capitalists, but I just might be willing to go along with a compromise position that gives more "balance" to the "left" and "right" varieties of libertarianism (notwithstanding that pro-capitalist libertarians such as myself don't actually consider ourselves "right wing", as we reject the one-dimensional political spectrum altogether), provided that a similar thing is done with respect to anarchism. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan*</a> July 1, 2005 00:39 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's what I'm talking about. I think the most NPOV solution that can be reached is to 'demilitarize' the small-l/small-a terms, and cede the big-A/big-L terms to the pro-social and pro-Capitalism groups respectively as proper nouns/terms of art that have somewhat settled associations (in the case of Anarchism, going back more than a hundred years) <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatzenjammer_c526.html" title="User:Katzenjammer">Katzenjammer</a> 1 July 2005 11:43 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Katz&gt; "This implies that the 'anarchism' page itself be a pure portal/distributor/disambiguator page, and that each of the sects settle for having a page with a fully-qualified/disambiguated title."</p>
<p>I take it you mean something like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anarchism&amp;oldid=14880685" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anarchism&amp;oldid=14880685" rel="nofollow">this Neutral Disambiguation Page</a>? That was suggested here (by me) early on - but every single one of the ansoc partisans rejected it out of hand. (And even got the sub-pages deleted.)</p>
<p>Yes, I do think the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarianism.html" title="Libertarianism">libertarianism</a> article would be more NPOV were it to have a similar "portal/distributor/disambiguator page." E.g.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><b>Libertarianism</b> in its most general sense is a philosophy holding liberty to be the primary political value.</p>
<p><b>Libertarianism</b> may mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>Libertarianism (capitalist) - the a political philosophy favoring personal and economic liberty or freedoms to the extent that they do not infringe on the same freedoms of others.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Libertarianism (socialist) - political philosophies dedicated to opposing coercive forms of authority and social hierarchy, in particular the institutions of capitalism and the state.</li>
</ul>

<dd>I disagree completely with Katzenjammer. I think the current disambig scheme in both Anarchism and Libertarianism is the way to go. The Libertarianism page has already been through a RFC, and multiple people have come and gone trying to get liberatrian socialism on that page. It never works!!! At least try learning from past mistakes. My biggest problem is what other word would you use for non-anarcho-capitalist anarchism, and what would you call non-libertarian socialism libertarianism? To rename both would require us to basically make up a new term. Unlike what was said above, not all non-individualist/non-capitalist anarchism is anarcho-communism (anarcho-syndicalism and post left anarchy are completely different). The best word to use might be social anarchism, but that word was originally used as a contrast to individualist anarchism, and may not include some newer variants. In short, anarchists use the word anarchism (with no qualifiers), anarcho-capitalists, use the word anarcho-capitalism. Let them have their page, and point to that page where nessecery in this article, just as libertarianism points to libertarian socialism whenever it might be mentioned. There's no need to reproduce info. in several articles just to appease some people who haven't been here to see these same edit wars ad nauseum. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillerc_2ebe.html" title="User:Millerc">millerc</a> 1 July 2005 13:02 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you're the one who misunderstood. I have no problem with describing different political philosophies. What doesn't work is trying to label non-anarcho-capitalists as something like "socialist-anarchist" or someother BS, since they call themselves anarchists (no qualifiers). In fact, the best solution I've heard so far is the historical approach advocated by albamuth. Its what worked for the liberalism article, which seems to have achieved as much of a NPOV as a political article can. But this has already been suggested in the past (see the archives)! No one else's idea of anarchism or libertarianism or liberalism is being pushed aside. 'Libertarian socialism' is seen as a valid term by libertarian socialists, but there is no corrosponding valid term for what I would call right wing liberatrianism. The same is true for anarcho-capitalism and anarchism... <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillerc_2ebe.html" title="User:Millerc">millerc</a> 1 July 2005 16:13 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wouldn't it be more true to our pro-social beliefs, as Pedant implied above, to agree a cooperative solution in which everyone gets a fair share? <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatzenjammer_c526.html" title="User:Katzenjammer">Katzenjammer</a> 1 July 2005 12:08 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Everyone having their "fair share" does not entail that a handful of people in a town of 10,000 should get half the representation, over and above even more significant factions such as primitivists and individualists. Currently the article is already disambiguated, there was only one single group which wanted it disambiguated and it was done just for their sake. This should be all that is necessary. Then the anarcho-capitalism section was added back in, which is redundant when it is already disambiguated since this page is no longer supposed to be about their selective definition. I'm happy to go with either of these solutions (rather than both), and either is completely "fair" given both the controversial nature of their claims to our tradition and their relative insignificance historically, they are getting their very own page to detail their views, and either way a method by which to link from this page to their own. To do what the anarcho-capitalists are attempting to do, have this page both disambiguated and introduce anarcho-capitalism, -plus- change the definition to suit their bias, and add in a bunch of misleading charts combined with over-simplified comparisons, and rearrange categories to make it appear that wikipedia itself supports their claims, and put in tons of links to their own factional books, is certainly not in the realm of "fair". <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 1 July 2005 17:10 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Kev still doesn't grok the difference between disambiguating different definitions of "anarchism" and links to particular schools. Well, Katz, you see the problem. Not a single partisan anarcho-socialist supports the neutral disambituation idea. I suspect that some may come around in the long run, but only after months of edit warring (and/or article protection) when it will become apparent that they will never regain absolute control over the article. It seems to me that so long as the ansoc faction sees the possibility of "winning", either via binding arbitration or edit warring, they will not come to the table willing to negotiate. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 1 July 2005 17:44 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Kev, have we been sufficiently clear about what we're proposing? Your description makes me feel that we haven't. We're talking about a bare-bones page that points to sectarian pages. That would mean that this current page would no longer be required to have <i><b>any</b></i> pro-Capitalist content at all, not even links. It could be made 100% pro-social, with all negotiation limited to like-minded people. All NPOV-ness would be encoded in the tree structure of the pages, not in the content of any page. This page, under our proposed solution, could become the 'Anarchism' page rather than the 'anarchism' page. The 'anarchism' page would be the neutral, bare-bones page that would point to all the second-tier pages.</dd>

I suggest that anyone who wants the article to be unlocked, stop debating. Official Wikipedia policy says pages shoulnd't be locked for very long. It's going on a month now. .

<dd>If you think I'm wrong, remember there are 500 administrators who can unprotect this page; asking on <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFPP_fba0.html" title="WP:RFPP">WP:RFPP</a> is the standard way of asking not only for protection, but also for <i>un</i>protection. However, think twice before doing so; if it is unprotected and the edit war that caused the protection continues, I won't protect the article again unless the situation turns ridiculous (and perhaps not even then). Oh, and by the way, do not forget about <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Anarchism (disambiguation)">Anarchism (disambiguation)</a> if you <i>do</i> ask for unprotection.</dd>

Whether things are being reverted in a short time frame in rapid succession or over a longer time frame on more infrequent occasion what is the difference? At least Wikipedia would be functioning. Now it's not functioning with this article. If there is conflicting thought then the content of the article should be oscillating on a second by second basis if necessary. Isn't that the whole beauty of Wikipedia --that there's no finality? This whole thing about seeking consensus is absurd --trying to apply principles for a static situation to a dynamic one. On Wikipedia, once a so-called consensus is reached, it becomes irrelevant immediately afterward. It apparently only serves to give those few editors who have succesfully appeased each other a false sense of accomplishment. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 2 July 2005 04:23 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hogeye, if you read the RFM carefully, you'll see that I do not ask that a mediator intervene to help decide what the definition of anarchism is to be. Rather, I ask the mediators to step in to help fascilitate this debate, which has ground to a halt. I am not going to appeal to any mediator to say&#160;:"this or that argument is valid" but rather help both parties understand what criteria are necessary for creating an accurate, representative article, <b>and more importantly</b>, the proper <i>grounds</i> upon which to resolve editorial conflict.

<dd>Albamuth, I have a question (the triumph of hope over experience, it seems on the record to date): let's say that somehow, we pro-social anarchists 'win' this quarrel. How exactly will we benefit? Will we have set a precedent that we can use over at the 'libertarianism' quarrel, the ideological mirror-image of this one? Will we have gained allies who will help resist later attempts at vandalism? Will we have improved our ability to solve problems cooperatively--the <i>sine qua non</i> of pro-social anarchistic life? Will we have improved the state of the world in <i><b>any substantive way at all</b></i>? If not--what's the point? Is it sort of like climbing a mountain or developing skill at a video game?

I'm not about winning here, I'm attempting to approximate '<i>truth</i> as closely as possible.

<dd>This battle--and its mirror image over at 'libertarianism', mutatis mutandis--strongly reminds me of the equal-marriage-rights battle. On the one side are people maintaining that queers mustn't be allowed equality or it will somehow devalue het marriages, and on the other side are people saying it's not a zero-sum issue, that there's no shortage of marriage licences. If you press the no-equality people for an explanation of exactly <i>how</i> it will spoil het marriages, they can't say.</dd>
<dd>This looks to me like a similar issue: it's not zero-sum; there's no shortage of pages. Whether one group gets a page has nothing at all to do whether some other group gets a page. As long as everyone coming in from the outside can find each page with equal ease, what's the problem? You say it will 'lead down a rabbit-hole' etc. That sounds like the same sort of vague 'end civilization as we know it' stuff that the anti-equal-rights people say. If I were to press you about just what you mean by that, could you explain it to me in detail? The anti-equal-rights people can't. They can't get any further, they go in a circle: it'd be bad because it would. <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatzenjammer_c526.html" title="User:Katzenjammer">Katzenjammer</a> 3 July 2005 07:20 (UTC)

<dd>You say that everyone can have a page, but I have no idea how that is relevant. The anarcho-capitalists 'do' have a page, several of them in fact. Further, they have links from the main anarchism page to their own, and will according to almost every solution offered. You are drawing a false comparison here. What we object to is that the NPOV policy of wikipedia is misused to give a smaller sub-movement (which may not even be a sub-movement) disproportionate representation. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 3 July 2005 18:52 (UTC)

<dd>What are we encoding in the current page relationship? To me, it looks like we're encoding differences in legitimacy (<i>Ours (pro-social) is the REAL anarchism and yours isn't!</i>) What other purpose could there be in not allowing everyone to have an entry point at the same level? What else could that kind of subordination possibly encode?</dd>
<dd>That's why it reminds me of the equal-marriage-rights hoohah. Some people opposing equal rights are maybe marginally okay with giving queers 'civil unions', but there's no way they're going to let them have marriage, by God! But should people have fewer rights because they're fewer in number in the population? That doesn't seem right to me.

<p>I'd like to take this opportunity to further send everyone in a tirade of capitalist fumes and brimstone by stating the the word libertarian was stolen from anarchists by capitalists. Originally, back in the 1800s to say you were libertarian was often short for saying libertarian socialist. I don't know how the libertarian party stole this term from its once common usage as an anarchist term but it is certainly incorrect to further ruin the english language by separating things into libertarian sections of anti-state and "pro-capitalist", the original libertarians were not capitalist at all! I say we compromise by destroying the internet, then nobody can have their precious definitions, and all that will matter is what always mattered in these situations, who you see in the streets and who you see counting bills! --<a href="../../../f/a/t/User%7EFatal_5ada.html" title="User:Fatal">Fatal</a> 2 July 2005 16:33 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In the 1800's in America, "libertarian" meant an individualist anarchist --one who opposed collectivism, including collectivism in property, advocated private property, advocated a market economy, and supported trading labor for wages that adehered to the labor theory of value and opposed profit. That is how "libertarianism" today has come to refer to the theory that opposes collectivism, supports private property, and a market economy, but differs in that it supports profit. So, the term wasn't really "stolen." It's just that you're only looking at the 19th century European usage which was collectivist in nature. Libertarianism in America has always referred to individualism as opposed to collectivism. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 3 July 2005 03:50 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't have a sense that that's accurate. I think your 'individualism' / 'collectivism' division is a false dichotomy. Socialist libertarians believe that ownership (and thus both profit and risk) should be fully distributed rather than concentrated, i.e., that individuals should participate equally in all aspects of socioeconomic life. That seems very 'individualist' to me. <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatzenjammer_c526.html" title="User:Katzenjammer">Katzenjammer</a> 3 July 2005 07:41 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The term "collectivism" can have a broad range of meanings. If you restict the meaning to <b>property arrangements</b>, then RJ11 has a good point. Anarcho-socialists don't believe that individuals should own capital goods. They believe that only certain collectives should hold ownership. I.e. Collectives like communes, syndicals, and cooperatives (but not joint stock companies). OTOH anarcho-capitalists believe any person - individual or group - should have the right to own stuff. So it seems to me that wrt property, Anarchism (individualist) and Anarchism (collectivist) are pretty good categories. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 3 July 2005 17:01 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That overstates the case. There are plenty--I'm one of them--who believe that ownership of 'capital goods' (a nice term!) should be fully and evenly distributed (1 person, 1 share) across the set of people producing the wealth. (That's a somewhat simplified exposition, but the point is that we believe in individual ownership, not group ownership.) <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatzenjammer_c526.html" title="User:Katzenjammer">Katzenjammer</a> 3 July 2005 17:36 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But a joint stock company (even one restricted to one person - one share) is a form of <b>collective</b> ownership of capital goods. IOW someone may individually own a share, but the share simply certifies that he holds (with others) <i>collective</i> ownership of capital goods. Furthermore, in your system I'm not convinced that the individual really owns even that one share. Let's test that. In your system, can the individual sell his share to any willing buyer? <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 3 July 2005 18:14 (UTC)

<p>(sic) <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbamuth_eea6.html" title="User:Albamuth">albamuth</a> To be fair, most anarcho-socialists don't support slavery like Alba. And most spell better, too.</p>
<p>I think virtually all anarcho-capitalists admit that people can, and have, sold themselves into slavery. The controversial questions are along the lines of <i>is it a valid contract?</i> (A very small minority claim that self-ownership is a category error.) But let's not go off on this tangent now...</p>
<p>Unlike self-ownership, the validity of owning of capital goods and shares of capital goods is not controversial. Katz has admitted that ansocs own capital goods in some manner. To me, anarcho-socialism is reminiscent of feudalism, where only certain privileged groups are allowed to own stuff. Human progress has largely been expanding the right of property ownership from restricted castes of the ancien regime to the individual, i.e. respecting the right of all people to own property.</p>

<p>That certainly looks like a 'privileged group' in both senses of the term. Under our system, on the other hand, absolutely EVERYone would be an owner. Even if they were unable to actively contribute to the common wealth because of severe disability, they would own a share in what might be termed the 'global corporation', the income from it representing their share of the royalties from natural resource use. <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatzenjammer_c526.html" title="User:Katzenjammer">Katzenjammer</a> 3 July 2005 20:42 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It looks to me like the person with disability is privileged in your example. They get to rip off other people's production - exploit them.

Katz&gt; "Then every company under Capitalism right now is also 'collective ownership of capital goods'..."</p>
<p>That is correct. If you know history, then you know that joint stock companies were considered downright communist by most 19th century pro-capitalist types. Ironic, isn't it, since today corporations are held up as the epitome of capitalism - at least by its enemies.</p>
<p><br />
Katz&gt; "Yes, an owner can sell their share at any time they like--but, again like most privately-held companies today, the seller is required to sell it back to the other owners."</p>
<p>You are mistaken that "most" privately held companies restrict sale to only the current owners. Some do, though. So let me make sure I understand you here. Suppose I am a retired Acme Dildo Coop worker, a bone fide owner of one share. I come into some wealth, and I buy all outstanding shares from all other holders, with their full consent. Now I own the firm. Is this kosher by your rules?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know that I'm mistaken about "most". I'm reasonably sure "most" are family businesses, with restrictive covenants. Do you have data?</dd>
<dd>As to buying all the shares? Sure. You wouldn't even have to own one of them to start with. If everyone agrees to sell, then you could certainly buy. But you'd have to operate the business yourself if you wanted to continue owning the whole thing, because our system wouldn't allow the wage slavery that degenerate ownership requires. <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatzenjammer_c526.html" title="User:Katzenjammer">Katzenjammer</a> 3 July 2005 20:42 (UTC)</dd>

Katz&gt; "Apart from your system allowing more degeneracy in ownership, I can't think of much distinction between your system and ours."</p>
<p>Anarcho-capitalism allows any person or group to own capital goods. Your system restricts ownership to only certain <i>blessed</i> groups. It's the same as the difference between feudalism, where only the monarch and his barons could own land, and a system where every human can own land. That said, I agree that in practice most people wouldn't care a whit about whether the firm they shop at or the place they work has freely transferrable shares or not. Who really cares or knows whether the local grocery store is a corporation or an employee-owned coop. They just look at the price of milk and eggs. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 3 July 2005 19:31 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What a ridiculous false dicotomy! One alternative to a restrictive system <i>that allows only certain subsets of the population to own</i> is a system that allows <i>any</i> subset to own. Even "degenerate" singleton subsets (aka individuals.) This system where any subset can be an owner is called anarcho-capitalism. There have been systems in history where only households could legally own stuff; there have been systems where only royalty could own stuff (they even had the same myth as socialism, that somehow the royalty owned it in the name of "everyone"). Anarcho-capitalism, unlike those, has no caste system restricting ownership. Everyone and every group has the right of ownership. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 5 July 2005 15:56 (UTC)

Instead I'll just opt out and violate your attempts to dominate everyone around you with property regulation whenever I feel the urge, and if you shoot me for it, hey, maybe I will shoot back. That is what anarchism is about Kev, what you seem to have ignored when sticking to your definitions and pretending there is no such thing as history, anarchism means railing against human domination in whatever form it appears, be it communist, fascist, imperialist, or capitalist. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 5 July 2005 16:15 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Since you seem obsessed with fallacies lately, this particular one would be a straw-man. In a capitalist society property is clearly and unreservedly enforceable, in fact this is often used as an example of why anarchism (which you falsely call anarcho-socialism) will not work, because our property definitions are not as strong and not as enforceable. In an anarchist society, the ability to enforce property claims is always disputable, always under scrutiny. Thus, while I can be fairly certain of being shot by violating property in many instances in a capitalist society (in fact, capitalists often advertise their willingness to kill thieves), there is a good chance that in an anarchist society I will be left alone in most cases due to the desire of individuals not to live in a society ruled by interpersonal domination. Again, we reject domination whenever it appears, even if it appears in socialism or communism. You reject domination whenever it appears in socialism or communism as well, but you wholeheartedly embrace it when it happens to be capitalist. Nice try though. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 5 July 2005 18:55 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What people will do and what they can do are two different things. Maybe you trust in the good nature of owners not to use the full extent of their powers when they have the option. If I had that trust, I would trust senators and presidents as well, perhaps even before I would trust the non-elected private tyrants that owners can become. Fact is that in capitalism one can legitimately shoot anyone for tresspassing, just claim that you were scared and thought they were robbers or some such BS. Personally, I don't like the idea of giving people the "right" to legitimately enforce their own dictates on other people, regardless of the system. But I'm certainly not portraying capitalism as worse than it is simply by revealing the fact that property owners can kill violators, this is well known and practiced today and generally upheld by "anarcho"-capitalists as perfectly legitimate. But there is a whole lot worse to capitalism than that. I mean, lets take for example actually existing capitalism, rather than theory. For example, the fact tha since its inception capitalism has always been allied with the state? Or like how capitalists tend to profit from supplying both sides in eternal conflicts, and indeed could even do so legitimately in a so-called "anarcho"-capitalist society? Or like how capitalists go to poor countries to "invest", so that they can strangle the economy of those countries for years (sometimes generations) by ripping every spare penny from them, pennies corporate executives then blow by visiting those same countries and throwing money about to coerce sex out of underaged girls and boys. And then they pat themselves on the back for helping out the poor! Wheee, capitalism is fun! Is any of this necessary for capitalism? No, but all of it is quite compatible with capitalism as it has always existed, and most of it is entirely compatible with capitalism even as the "anarcho"-capitalists like to dream it.</dd>

(no, I don't) or my favorite, C) socialism is just as bad or worse! In which case I will readily admit, any anarchist worth a damn would reject a socialist society, or any other society, that produced such horrors. So why is it that I constantly see supposely anarchist capitalists defending their ability to do the things above, rather than rejecting them as the atrocities they are? <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 6 July 2005 01:15 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, in anarcho-socialism only certain subsets of humanity can be valid owners of X. In anarcho-capitalism, <i>any</i> subset of humanity can validly own X.</p>
<p>Katz&gt; "You mean like...people with more money than they need for living? That certainly looks like a 'privileged group' in both senses of the term."</p>

<dd>I can only think of this as the 'Capitalist Mythos', that Hard Work and Wealth are bound together in a simple causal relationship: you work hard, you get wealthy; you don't, you don't. All our experience tells us, though, that 'the world is ill-divided / them that works the hardest / are the least provided'. GWBush, for example, is reeking wealthy; yet if the Mythos were true, he'd be lucky to be clerking in a 7-11 somewhere, and not in prison or dead in a ditch. <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatzenjammer_c526.html" title="User:Katzenjammer">Katzenjammer</a> 3 July 2005 23:22 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Very good. Sounds like anarcho-capitalism. The owner should of course make sure that he doesn't hire people who would attempt to steal his new business, and if there are a lot of imperialist anarcho-socialists around, hire a PDA to protect his property.

<dd>Oh. I'm talking about the real world - not socialist nirvana. In real life, there will always be different people with different ideas, on property and justice and so on. So I don't assume everyone thinks like me. There will always be competing ideological models, property systems, and legal systems. The main question between us anarchists is whether we are tolerant of other lifestyles, or we try to enforce our own upon others. So long as you anarcho-socialists don't try to force your system on anarcho-capitalists (and anarcho-Georgists, and individualist anarchists, ...) you're cool. However, if some anarcho-socialists voluntarily sell their property to an anarcho-capitalist and then try to renig and take it back by force (as you seem to endorse in the example), then they are committing meta-aggression. Self-defense of person and property is permissable. Fuckers trying to steal stuff might get shot. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 5 July 2005 15:46 (UTC)

<dd>Similarly, if we sell stuff to some dumbass who thinks he will then own it forever, and we sneak into his lot at night and use it for a bit without him knowing, then we are in full right to defend ourselves when he aggresses against us by trying to force us not to use it. Once again, you assume, as you always do, that the aggression is against those who are propertied, rather than against those who are dispossessed. You pretend to be objective in applying your meta principle, but your analysis always skews to your own tastes. And honestly, that "fuckers might get shot" bit is a great tagline for your supposedly "voluntary" society. Man stealing an apple from the king's (er, land baron's?) orchard to feed his family? Fucker might get shot. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 5 July 2005 19:01 (UTC)</dd>

Cesar&gt; "Isn't the second one redundant with the first one, since it's just "first one + something else"?"</p>
<p>Yes. But that's exactly how the anarcho-socialists define "anarchism." The whole issue is about whether to define anarchism as <i>anti-statism only</i> or <i>anti-statism plus anti-capitalism</i>.</p>
<p><br />
Katz&gt; "Anarchism - defined as above"</p>
<p>I don't follow you here. Which of the two definitions above do you mean? I'll assume you mean the anti-state definition, i.e. number 1.</p>
<p>Katz&gt; "Anarchism (pro-private-profit) - the political stance that opposes government as an entity, but has no objection to centers of power based on wealth."</p>
<p>I don't know <i>anyone</i> who defines "anarchism" this way. Where did this come from? So throwing this one out, we get:</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Anarchism</b> <i>broad def; dictionary def; qua anti-statism; or whatever</i> - the theory or doctrine that all forms of government are unnecessary, oppressive, and undesirable and should be abolished.</p>
<p><b>Anarchism</b> <i>narrow def; classical; socialistic; pro-social; or something else</i> - the political stance that opposes any non-democratically delegated center of power.</p>

The boss is the ruler, the patriarchal boyfriend is a ruler, the ceo of nike is a ruler, corporations are a set of rulers, capitalists are rulers! How can you not see this?? It's right in front of your eyes! The words "ruler" and "government" and "hierarchy" are <b>NOT</b> in any way shape or form totally and completely limited to the world of politicians, and they <b>NEVER</b> have been!

Fatal&gt; "I really don't know how you, Hogeye, can read the definition of anarchism and then still claim there's compatibility between capitalism and anarchism. "Without rule", yes! That's what anarchy is! The politician and statesmen are rulers."</p>
<p>So far, we agree totally. <i>Anti-statism</i> clearly falls under <i>anti-ruler</i>.</p>
<p>Fatal&gt; "You know what else? The boss is the ruler..."</p>
<p>But here anarcho-capitalists like me think you're off your rocker. A firm is a voluntary organization. You can opt out any time. Ergo, there is no rule. It is <i>voluntary</i> (in our terminology.) Bakunin expressed the importance of opting out (secession) quite well:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The internal reorganization of each country on the basis of the absolute freedom of individuals, of the productive associations, and of the communes. Necessity of recognizing the right of secession: every individual, every association, every commune, every region, every nation has the absolute right to selfdetermination, to associate or not to associate, to ally themselves with whomever they wish and repudiate their alliances without regard to so-called historic rights [rights consecrated by legal precedent] or the convenience of their neighbors. - Michael Bakunin, <a href="http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/bakunin/catechism.html" class="external text" title="http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/bakunin/catechism.html" rel="nofollow">Revolutionary Catechism</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Anarcho-capitalists take this notion of <i>opting out</i> very seriously - as the acid test for voluntary association. (Though most would quote Herbert Spencer ("<a href="http://www.constitution.org/hs/ignore_state.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.constitution.org/hs/ignore_state.htm" rel="nofollow">The Right to Ignore the State</a>") rather than Bakunin!)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(It helped considerably, of course, that Bakunin lived in a time and place where there was a 'Wild East'. People had the ability to 'opt out' because they could bugger off to Siberia, build an izbushka, and, if they could avoid freezing to death, live off the land with the Tsar's implicit blessing. Harder to do that today. About 98% impossible, in fact. <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatzenjammer_c526.html" title="User:Katzenjammer">Katzenjammer</a> 3 July 2005 07:52 (UTC) )
<dl>
<dd>??? It's still easy to opt out of most organizations. Bakunin supported secession <i>in principle</i>. His idea was not in any way dependent on the availability of new frontiers. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 3 July 2005 16:30 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Agreed that he supported it as a principle, and that it's still easy to opt out of most organizations--for anyone as nihilistic as he was. But for those, e.g., who have warm or at least responsible feelings for dependent animals such as cats and kids, the array of useful opting-out possibilities tends to collapse into a midden. <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatzenjammer_c526.html" title="User:Katzenjammer">Katzenjammer</a> 3 July 2005 17:12 (UTC)</dd>

Fatal&gt; "The words "ruler" and "government" and "hierarchy" are NOT in any way shape or form totally and completely limited to the world of politicians..."</p>
<p>The first two, "ruler" and "government," are. Anarcho-capitalists like me are basically neutral about hierarchies <i>per se</i>.

<p>The idea that one can "opt out" of a business at any time does not excuse capitalism even the slightest. First of all, this is not entirely true. Second of all, yes, one could quit their job, but then what would that mean? Lose your home, lose your food, lose your safety, security. It means that your needs can only be met through illegal means. If it is illegal to exist outside of capitalism, what does this tell us about capitalism? It is coercive, the "freedom" to quit is a joke, and a bad one at that, given to workers by capitalists to give the illusion they have freedom. It is not freedom when the capitalist class controls all of society, it is not freedom when one is prevented from living, short of living comfortably, unless they submit themselves to an unfree system. Your arguments are exactly the same as those which say "homeless people are lazy, why don't they just get a job? They're always mcdonalds!" McDonalds doesn't pay the rent, mcdonalds doesn't pay the bills, mcdonalds can barely even pay for a month worth of food let alone anything else. Also, be admitting that many would want to quit their jobs, you are admitting that life under the rule of capitalists is NOT something people want. It would be frivolous to go into all the examples. You can't get money under capitalism (legally) unless you work. Without money you can't get anything. Capitalism is coercive and it forces you to work under it. --<a href="../../../f/a/t/User%7EFatal_5ada.html" title="User:Fatal">Fatal</a> 3 July 2005 18:36 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Fallacy: Petito principi. The whole dispute is about whether anarchism, in its broadest sense, is opposed to States only, or opposed to both States and propertarianism/hierarchy. To anarcho-capitalists, voluntarily joining a group and taking directions from a leader is not <i>being ruled</i>. To an anarcho-socialist, it is. The concepts of <i>aggression</i> and <i>rule</i> depend on an underlying property system for meaning. Obviously, there are actions that ancaps consider non-aggressive that ansocs think are aggressive, and vice-versa. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 5 July 2005 16:41 (UTC)

<dd>Anarchists do not believe that one "voluntarily" joins a group to follow a leader in capitalism. Rather, they are coerced by a restrictive property system upheld by capitalists into joining a group and working at the whim of someone else for their survival, whether they want to join such groups or not, and whether they do in fact join such groups or not, the coercion is still present. "Voluntary" in this context is being used in a strange way by the ACs, a fascists could claim that their society is voluntary, you either voluntarily follow their leader, who happens to own all the land in that particular country, or you are thrown out (or sometimes killed) for trespassing. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 5 July 2005 18:48 (UTC)

<dd>If an anarchist commune denies the use of resources to another commune or individual without taking into account their needs or allowing them to represent themselves, then you are correct. Now really, why can't you say the same about capitalism? Because your property entitlement claims allow the owner complete control, and others can be shut off without any regard to their desires or even needs. Because that kind of coercive domination is okay, its only the other kinds you don't like? I wonder why you so love coercion when it is done by one owner, and only object to it when it is done by many, perhaps you have control issues? <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 6 July 2005 03:54 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're wrong, actually capitalist economists think a lot about the consequences and are the first to point out to problems and to propose solutions to them. Unfortunately, anarchist thinkers do not seem to think so far. Have you ever challeged your hypotheses? How will an anarchist society, for instance, prevent some people from gaining and seizing power? As you may remember, Hobbes analysed that situation, and came to the conclusion that anarchism (he didn't call it that, of course) would result in chaos, violence and despair. Unless you change human nature, you won't be able to create a peaceful anarchist society. <a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuis_rib_dc5a.html" title="User:Luis rib">Luis rib</a> 5 July 2005 19:14 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Gee, no, I've never even thought of questioning my beliefs, good thing you came along. People will prevent others from "seizing" power by way of mutual defense, voluntary disassociation, and by the creation of social norms that demphasize its importance and stress individual and community self-reliance. As for Hobbian analysis of human nature, I find it entirely lacking, and full of false presumptions as well, as any radical skeptic would. I'm not entirely sure what human nature is, but I find no compelling reasons to be convinced that Hobbes had a better grasp on it than I do. Finally, who said anything about a "peaceful" anarchist society? I mean, I would like it to be relatively peaceful, and there are a number of social institutions to help move toward that goal, but there will always (and to some degree should always) be conflict. Creating an armed police force to dominate all dissidents doesn't create peace, it just institutionalised this conflict in a particular way, a way that all anarchists abhor. Channeling that conflict toward outcomes positive or neutral to the society at large would be one way of dealing with it, but eliminating it altogether would be neither realistic nor necessarily desirable. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 6 July 2005 17:31 (UTC)</dd>

Actually, Fatal, the CEO of Nike (or any other corporation, for that matter) is NOT the ruler. The rulers are the shareholders. It is perfectly possible for workers to be shareholders - many corporations actually encourage that. It is even possible for workers to be the majority shareholders. In Europe (in the US i don't know) there is even a type of corporation called "société coopérative" (cooperative company) where all the shareholders are usually the workers - Switzerland's biggest distribution company Migros functions under that framework. In Germany, on the other hand, half of the board of directors are representatives from the workers by law. Thus your ruler-ruled paradigm doesn't correspond to practice. In reality - as always - things are much more complex than you care to admit.<a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuis_rib_dc5a.html" title="User:Luis rib">Luis rib</a> 3 July 2005 21:15 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Luis, I think you're being selective in your thinking. In the US--I would imagine it's broadly similar elsewhere, even if not quite so awful--85% of all shares are owned by the wealthiest 10% of the population. And, as Bk0 points out, the shareholders don't exercise executive control--senior management does. And who are they working for? The few who own the 85%, or the many who own the remaining 15%?</dd>
<dd>That's the <b>real</b> reality.</dd>
<dd>There are a few socialist corporations like the exemplary Mondragón Corporación Cooperativa (www.mcc.es) whose goal is to provide a comfortable living for many, not vast wealth for a privileged few, but until we reorganize worldwide economic life such that they are the only kind of corporation allowed anywhere, we're going to continue to be in trouble. <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatzenjammer_c526.html" title="User:Katzenjammer">Katzenjammer</a> 3 July 2005 23:47 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>One flaw in such "gap" analysis is that the 10% who owned it 10 years ago is not the same 10% that own it today, and won't be the same 10% that own it ten years from now. IOW, one fallacy of static "gap" argument is that it totally ignores social mobility. It fools non-astute readers into thinking that the 10% is a caste rather than a highly transient group.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Another implicit assumption in the above is that there is something wrong with unequal distribution of goods (shares in this case.) This is called an end-state theory of <a href="../../../d/i/s/Distributive_justice.html" title="Distributive justice">distributive justice</a>. Anarcho-capitalists like me do not hold an end-state theory - we hold an entitlement theory. IOW we evaluate distributive justice on the basis of history - whether the transactions leading up to the current distribution were just. Unlike end-staters, we don't naively look at a time-slice and judge solely from that. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 4 July 2005 17:32 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Katzenjammer: you are saying that more than 20 million people (10% of 200 mio) actually own shares in the United States? That's far more than I expected!</dd>
<dd>Another point: shareholders' power may indeed be weak - a question that would necessitate a whole discussion of its own - but there is one thing that disgruntled shareholders can always do: sell. By selling enough, pressure will built on the CEO to resign. Thus bad CEOs are eventually kicked out through shareholder action. Indeed, the United States is the country with the highest CEO turnaround - which is probably a proof of its shareholder capitalism. Indeed, even iconic CEOs like Carly Fiorina (formerly HP) have to resign when they don't please shareholders. In the same vein: even those dotcoms that lied ultimately failed when shareholders lost confidence in their lofty promises. Only those dotcoms that actually didn't lie (too much) survived (like Amazon or eBay). <a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuis_rib_dc5a.html" title="User:Luis rib">Luis rib</a> 4 July 2005 17:54 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here are definitions of <i>Anarchism</i> given by Proudhon, Bakunin, Kropotkin, and Emma Goldman Three out of four define it an <i>anti-statist but not necessarily anti-capitalist</i>. There's also a link to that random list of dictionary defs.</p>
<dl>
<dd>True. If you take a single sentence by any of these people, and you use it to define all that anarchism is, then anarchism is not necessarily anti-capitalist. Of course, if you read a single book by any of those people, you would be very hard pressed to argue that any of them believe that capitalism is remotely compatible with anarchism. But you could play this trick with any issue and any individual. Want to claim that Marx hated communism? Point out a single sentence in which he admitted a fault in some part thereof and ignore the rest. Want to pretend that capitalism is compatible with anarchism?

I can't say as to bakunin, as his isn't cited. Can you say that you've read all of those works Hogeye? If so, please oh please tell me how you came away with the impression that any of those individuals believed that capitalism was compatible with anarchism. The only reason none of them stated that capitalists can't be anarchists specifically is that no one at the time was dumb enough to claim as much, and if their other statements on the matter don't entail said incompatibility, then no statement possibly could.

So far, you have not shown any <b>evidence</b> that anarchism, and what PP, EG, and PK believed in, are two different things. Oh, and as for your case about how they defined anarchism:</p>
<p><b>Emma Goldman</b>: <a href="http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/goldman/aando/anarchism.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/goldman/aando/anarchism.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <i>To accomplish that unity, Anarchism has declared war on the pernicious influences which have so far prevented the harmonious blending of individual and social instincts, the individual and society. Religion, the dominion of the human mind; <b>Property</b>, the dominion of human needs; and Government, the dominion of human conduct, represent the stronghold of man's enslavement and all the horrors it entails.</i> (emphasis added)</p>
<p><b>Proudhon</b>: (please stop abusing this quotation!) <a href="http://www.mondopolitico.com/library/pjproudhon/whatisproperty/firstmemoir.c5.htm#p2.3" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mondopolitico.com/library/pjproudhon/whatisproperty/firstmemoir.c5.htm#p2.3" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p><i>"What are you, then?" — "I am an anarchist."</i></p>
<p><i>"Oh! I understand you; you speak satirically. This is a hit at the government." — "By no means. I have just given you my serious and well-considered profession of faith. Although a firm friend of order, I am (in the full force of the term) an anarchist. Listen to me."</i></p>
<p>(and after quite a bit of rambling about the development of civilization)</p>
<p><i>Thus, in a given society, the authority of man over man is inversely proportional to the stage of intellectual development which that society has reached; and the probable duration of that authority can be calculated from the more or less general desire for a true government, — that is, for a scientific government. And just as the right of force and the right of artifice retreat before the steady advance of justice, and must finally be extinguished in equality, so the sovereignty of the will yields to the sovereignty of the reason, and must at last be lost in scientific socialism. Property and royalty have been crumbling to pieces ever since the world began. As man seeks justice in equality, so society seeks order in anarchy.</i></p>
<p><b>Kropotkin</b>:<a href="http://www.blackcrayon.com/page.jsp/library/britt1910.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.blackcrayon.com/page.jsp/library/britt1910.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> <i>As to their economical conceptions, the anarchists, in common with all socialists, of whom they constitute the left wing, maintain that the now prevailing system of private ownership in land, and our capitalist production for the sake of profits, represent a monopoly which runs against both the principles of justice and the dictates of utility. They are the main obstacle which prevents the successes of modern technics from being brought into the service of all, so as to produce general well-being. The anarchists consider the wage-system and capitalist production altogether as an obstacle to progress. But they point out also that the state was, and continues to be, the chief instrument for permitting the few to monopolize the land, and the capitalists to appropriate for themselves a quite disproportionate share of the yearly accumulated surplus of production. Consequently, while combating the present monopolization of land, and capitalism altogether, the anarchists combat with the same energy the state, as the main support of that system.

<dd>No one is claiming any official title of anarchism from what I can see. Further, anarcho-capitalists have been had every opportunity to state their opinions both informally on the talk pages and formally on their own page and elsewhere in relevant pages. Finally, almost all the editors believe that this page should refer to anarcho-capitalism in some fashion, including a link to their article. The conflict is more a matter of having the anarcho-capitalists define and determine the status of the main anarchism page to reflect their own personal bias, over and above the views of all other anarchists and anarchist sub-groups, something not only in violation of wiki policy, but also not particularly "close to anarchism" imho. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 6 July 2005 07:05 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">No Reason for Debate</span></h2>
<p>This entry has been the subject of edit wars for some time. It's time for the so-called "anarcho-capitalists" to stick to their own page and leave this entry alone. Anarcho-capitalism has never been a part of anarchism and it is simply factually incorrect for this entry to treat anarcho-capitalism with any seriousness. The Anarchist FAQ has throroughly debunked anarcho-capitalism as an ideology. Just because a few misguided individuals sabotage this entry with their nonsense about anarcho-capitalism doesn't mean that Wikipedia should allow false information to be posted as a live entry. People can check any anthology of anarchist writings at your library and find nothing about anarcho-capitalism. It has nothing to do with anarchism. There is no need to qualify anarchism as consisting of "left anarchism" vs. "anarcho-capitalism." Please get the correct version of this article online without the section about anarcho-capitalism. A link to the anarcho-capitalism section would be understandable, but a section in this version on anarcho-capitalism is simply inaccurate. -- Chuck0, Infoshop.org and Radical Reference</p>

<dd>I'm not here to "cause trouble" at all. I'm here to help correct the article. If that's troubling to you, that's unfortunate. Either way, whether it's interminable debate, or endless editing, there will be no resolution. There will always be anarchists who think somebody else's school of anarchism is not real anarchism (as in the traditional individualists who held that communist and syndicalist forms were not anarchism). So, the best we can do is edit endlessly without resolution. A dynamic article is better than a stagnant one. The point of Wikipedia is not for writers to appease other, but to provide dynamic, living articles, that anyone can edit. I, for one, will not the sacrifice quality and accuracy of an article for the sake of avoiding conflict or avoiding "causing trouble."

I agree with Juanco. Let's go back to the following Neutral Disambiguation Page and avoid edit wars.</p>
<p><b>Anarchism</b> is derived from the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_language.html" title="Greek language">Greek</a> <i><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%B1%CF%81%CF%87%CE%AF%CE%B1" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:αναρχία">αναρχία</a></i> ("without <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archon.html" title="Archon">archons</a> (rulers)"). Thus "anarchism," in its most general meaning, is the philosophy or belief that rulership is unnecessary and should be abolished. For other usages, see <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Anarchism (disambiguation)">anarchism (disambiguation)</a>.</p>
<p><b>Anarchism</b> may mean:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_%28anti-state%29.html" title="Anarchism (anti-state)">Anarchism (anti-state)</a> - the theory or doctrine that all forms of government are unnecessary, oppressive, and undesirable and should be abolished.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_%28socialist%29.html" title="Anarchism (socialist)">Anarchism (socialist)</a> - philosophies, movements, and ideologies that advocate the abolition of capitalist exploitation and all other forms of authority.</li>

<dd>As you indicate - the original Greek meaning does not literally apply to the Anarchist philosophy and movement. But the rest is incorrect - No encyclopedia or textbook on the subject defines there being two camps.

<dd>Get real, Max. The anarcho-socialists are just as intransigent. They too refuse to budge an inch on the definition of anarchism, and denigrate all objective sources such as dictionaries and even the words of their own luminaries. What you're really saying is that the anarcho-socialist clique temporarily had control of the article until people with a different point of view showed up again.</dd>

<dd>The Swiss cantons of old simply divided when faced with fundamental differences (e.g. Reformation.) There are semi-independent half-cantons and even (I think) quarter cantons.

<dd>What individualist anarchist section? There isn't one. It isn't included as a school of anarchism. It's just mentioned in the internal conflicts section. The POV collectivist anarchists took the section out, apparently since the individualists support private property and a market economy. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 00:36, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>LOOK</b> = Individualism vs. collectivism:<br />
<i>While most anarchists favor collective property, some, such as individualist anarchists of historical note support a right to private property. These include Benjamin Tucker and Lysander Spooner. Tucker argues that collectivism in property is absurd: "That there is an entity known as the community which is the rightful owner of all land, Anarchists deny...I...maintain that ‘the community’ is a non-entity, that it has no existence..." He was particularly adamant in his opposition to "communism," even to the point of asserting that those who opposed a right to private property were not anarchists: "Anarchism is a word without meaning, unless it includes the liberty of the individual to control his product or whatever his product has brought him through exchange in a free market—that is, private property. Whoever denies private property is of necessity an Archist." However, these individuals opposed property titles to unused land.</i></p>

<dd>Exactly. I'm the one who wrote that section in "Internal conflicts" since the POV collectivists anarchists didn't want individualist anarchism included as a school of anarchism.

Furthermore, there was some agreement earlier to refer to Molinari (and Godwin) as proto-anarchists rather than anarchists - a solution that perhaps everyone can live with. I.e. Gustav de Molinari was a proto-anarcho-capitalist, and should be included in the history as such. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a></p>

<p><cite id="fn_anti_ac_1"><a href="#fn_anti_ac_1_back" title="">Note anti_ac_1</a>:</cite> This is a case of people being stuck in the past and wanting to keep everybody else there. Of course, anarcho-capitalism, is incompatible with "traditional anarchism." But, so what? This article is called "Anarchism," not "Traditional Anarchism." <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a></p>
<p><cite id="fn_anti_ac_2"><a href="#fn_anti_ac_2_back" title="">Note anti_ac_2</a>:</cite> By the same logic one could say that a flower is defined as a plant, but it isn't defined as growing in dirt and requiring water, so those things aren't necessary. From a basic definition you draw obvious conclusions. Anarchism is against hierarchy, therefore it will be against, for example, sexism. Capitalism is yet another obvious thing that anarchism is against. <a href="../../../f/a/t/User%7EFatal_5ada.html" title="User:Fatal">Fatal</a></p>
<p><cite id="fn_anti_ac_3"><a href="#fn_anti_ac_3_back" title="">Note anti_ac_3</a>:</cite> You think all anarchism is collectivist anarchism. Traditional individualist anarchism does not oppose voluntary boss and employee relationships as long as they stick to the labor theory of value. Involuntary hierarchy is opposed, of course, but not hierarchy in itself unless you're a collectivist anarchist. Maybe you don't think traditional individualist anarchism is real anarchism? If so, you're wrong. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a></p>
<p><cite id="fn_anti_ac_4"><a href="#fn_anti_ac_4_back" title="">Note anti_ac_4</a>:</cite> I don't know the exact numbers involved, but the libertarian movement is large and significant, with many publications and organizations (though, as others have noted, they're less prone to rioting in the streets and smashing things, which makes them less-often in the news; however, the local newscast in my area yesterday specifically mentioned the Libertarian Party as the instigator of a successful move to get the county to repeal its ban on Sunday liquor sales). Within the libertarian movement, there are more minarchists than anarcho-capitalists, but anarcho-capitalism (often referred to within the libertarian movement as simply "anarchism", since that term has the meaning of "anti-government" with no socialist baggage in these circles) is widely recognized as the most pure and extreme form of libertarianism even if most libertarians decline to go that far themselves. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan*</a></p>
<p><cite id="fn_anti_ac_5"><a href="#fn_anti_ac_5_back" title="">Note anti_ac_5</a>:</cite> Actually all schools of anarchism are compatible with each other in the broad sense, all major things are the same, like the abolition of hierarchy. And if you're one of these people that likes to use the word government because you think that excludes other hierarchy, i've got news for you, they're synonyms. --<a href="../../../f/a/t/User%7EFatal_5ada.html" title="User:Fatal">Fatal</a> 01:19, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><cite id="fn_anti_ac_6"><a href="#fn_anti_ac_6_back" title="">Note anti_ac_6</a>:</cite> Again, as I pointed out above, traditioanl individualist anarchists do not oppose hierarchy as long as it's voluntary. All anarchism is not collectivism.

<dd>Harris, the NDP has absolutely nothing to do with the a/c page. It has to do with the general Anarchism article only. The NDP would point to two articles - one about Anarchism using the broad (anti-state) definition, the other with the narrow (anti-state + socialist) definition - and let the Wiki user decide which meaning to choose. Then, instead of having a permanent edit war, we'd have at most the occasional vandalism of <i>the other faction's</i> article.

<p>Let's say that by some chance we come up with a consensus. What does it matter? As soon as we get the article the way we want it, a few new guys will show up that weren't a part of that consensus that don't agree with how anarcho-capitalism is represented. Then all of a sudden there's a lack of consensus and we edit war again. I'm just pointing out the futility of the whole procedure. I say just unlock the article and let it be. Whatever is going to happen is going to happen, and happen over and over and over. Recognize the futility of what we're doing. Don't kid yourselves that we're going to come up with any sort of finality here. All of our edits will be erased an infinite number of times over. Enough is enough.

<p>I added a new proposal with the following rationale:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>To avoid confusion, we all should use consitent language and follow accepted usage.</li>
<li>As it stands now, almost all unqualified uses of the word "anarchism" in wikipedia refers to socialist/collectivist anarchism— even Individualist Anarchism is generally qualified.</li>
<li>If we accept the default unqualified term "anarchism" to refer to a philosophy that is anti-state <b>and</b> anti-capitalist, Ancaps aren't "anarchists" by this usage.</li>
<li>If an <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-capitalist.html" title="Anti-capitalist">anti-capitalist</a> article exists, it follows that an <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-statism.html" title="Anti-statism">anti-statism</a> article should as well, since the two philosophies aren't by necessity linked.</li>
<li>Since the Ancap definition of "anarchism" is synonymous with anti-statism alone, any relevant Ancap material can be added to that article.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I've been trying to NPOVify the ancap article, and my experience seems to indicate that the whole problem stems from a linguistic dispute over the proper definition of Anarchism. I believe both sides are correct. The English language is not as precise an instrument as we'd like it to be, and any solution is going to be, by definition, arbitrary. I suggest the compromise: Accept the socialist/collectivist defintion of the word "anarchism" as anti-capitalist and anti-statist, and use the more general, accurate, and less confusing term "anti-statism" for the Ancap definition of "anarchism" and allow the anti-statism article be a repository for tracing the history and development of anti-government philosophy in general, leaving this page to trace the history and development of socialist Anarchism. This isn't a matter of one side "winning" the debate, but of establishing a common lexicon where people on both sides might find it possible to write a mutually-agreed-upon articles. <a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESaswann_93bc.html" title="User:Saswann">Saswann</a> 30 June 2005 16:27 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Disambiguation note?</span></h2>
<p>Hogeye/others, since you seem to have admitted the following: 1) There are multiple definitions of anarchism (as is evident by your forking) 2) You wish to avoid an edit war&#160;; on what grounds can you continue to oppose pointing the reader to anarcho-capitalism by means of a disambiguation note? <b>It is standard policy to do this if one meaning is more notable.</b> That anarcho-capitalism is less notable than what you call "<a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_%28socialist%29.html" title="Anarchism (socialist)">Anarchism (socialist)</a>" is clear, no argument necessary.</p>
<p>So I have two questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>1) Does anyone else see this as a reasonable solution?</b></li>
<li><b>2) If not, on what grounds?</b></li>
</ul>

<dd>For the umpteenth time: the issue is not about the anarcho-capitalism article.

<dd>It appears that the goal of this capitalist POV war is not to present their "anarcho-capitalist" "philosophy" in an acceptable, NPOV manner; but rather to dilute the definition of anarchism to the point where it loses all coherence and connection with anarchist tradition and history. It is reactionary in the extreme and not at all benign. For that reason alone I'm not comfortable with the "Anarchism (socialist)" nonsense. It's not socialist, it's <b>anarchist</b>. --<a href="../../../b/k/0/User%7EBk0_a429.html" title="User:Bk0">Bk0</a> 01:46, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"...or the narrower popular definition." - Unfortunately for you, Wikipedia <i>always</i> uses the "narrower popular definition" in favor of dictionary definitions (especially when most people would equate the two, since seeing capitalism as "cooperative" is a little off the wall). And that definition gets the main article. Also, by saying, "Click and compare. Not the same at all - different subjects." - are you saying that you agree with what we were saying all along, i.e. that anarcho-capitalism is an entirely different topic? --<a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETothebarricades.tk_2bb0.html" title="User:Tothebarricades.tk">Tothebarricades</a> 03:26, Jun 23, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I'm saying that an overall anarchism article is different from an article about anarcho-capitalism. Obviously. In free-market capitalism, any interaction between two people must be voluntary, and every trade mutually beneficial ex ante. That's cooperation. One man, one veto. That's <i>much</i> more cooperative than majoritarian-ruled communes.

<dd>Your dicdef is false due to selection bias. The "web" dictionaries you suggested on the fork VFD were of very poor quality. Additionally they were predominantly English-US. Pocket dictionaries are entirely unsuitable to resolve this issue. Additionally, most dictionaries you cite are poor in terms of contemporary usage. OED3 anarchy 1b is the most useful head for us, being "A theoretical social state in which there is no governing person or body of persons, but each individual has absolute liberty (without implication of disorder)." whose usage "1892 Daily News 27 Apr. 5/8 Anarchy means the placing in common of all this world's riches to allow each to consume according to his needs. Anarchy is a great family where each will be protected by all and will take whatever he requires." clearly indicates the common usage of anarchy to present a social state with no government and no disorder (OED3 headword: Anarchy, def 1b, usage 1892 Daily News). Compare, if we shall, to anarcho-capitalism (first use 1969) and particularly anarcho-capitalist (first use 1969, usage, "1969 Libertarian 15 May 3/1 The great majority of revolutionary anarcho-capitalists are highly enthusiastic about the Black Panthers and their potential for leading a black liberation movement." (OED3). These somewhat confused neologisms, whose usage has varied so greatly between 1969 and today that the prior sees the eager support of the Black Panthers and the contemporary sees the worship of the oligarchs of private government (or capitalists, for when money speaks with its iron tongue, that is a form of govern-ing). OED3, due to its etymological concern, acts as a very solid dictionary of international English. Anarcho-capitalism, being a usage strongly at odds with the chief social usage of anarchy in English, being, "the placing in common of all this world's riches to allow each to consume according to his needs," AND, as the smaller social movement, AND, as the more recent social movement, should be disambiguated on a seperate page. It is gross cultural imperialism to subsume international English behind the petty English of US college campuses, simply to tar the article with a brush whose colour you detest. <a href="../../../f/i/f/User%7EFifelfoo_12d0.html" title="User:Fifelfoo">Fifelfoo</a> 23:29, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Even your cherry-picked definition does not rule out capitalism. Anarcho-capitalism is definitely a theoretical social state in which there is no governing person or body of persons, but each individual has absolute liberty. Thank you. We can add one more dictionary which agrees that anarchism is anti-statist but not necessarily anti-capitalist.

<dd>You might try reading an introduction to a definitive etymological dictionary, like OED sometime. Usage is meaning, and the collection of distinctive and widespread usages is a key function of an etymological dictionary. Compilers of etymological dictionaries create definitions through analysis of first usages*, thus meaning that usage is very important. Usages prior to 1892 include solid references to the Narodniki's collectivism, Proudhon in his mutualist moment**, and prior to that, the sainted Godwin. Obviously one may make a case for Godwin's usage; whereas it is difficult to bend mutualism into the ultra-propertarian definition of anarcho-capitalism, let alone the peasant-communalism of the narodniks. [*first usages are important because they indicate the time that a usage became common, current or unique from other usages. Second usages are less important. **While Proudhon supported the interchange of possession in his mutualism, its stringing Odysseus' bow to claim that his mutualism is compatible with the freedom of private property declared by anarcho-capitalists.] <a href="../../../f/i/f/User%7EFifelfoo_12d0.html" title="User:Fifelfoo">Fifelfoo</a> 00:04, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Bottom line: The definition that you cited supports the <i>anarchism qua anti-statism</i> position. Your appeal to etymology is laughable, since anarchism comes from Greek meaning "without ruler", i.e. without a State. Perhaps you should look a little earlier than 1892 for 'first use.' LOL. BTW, I've already cited Proudhon's first use in 1840 in "What is Property." His def also agrees with the broad tent definition.</dd>

<dd>I oppose that because "Anarchism" is commonly regarded as referring to theory. It's <i>this</i> article that needs to deal with the various philosophical positions. If anyone wants to talk about a so-called "social movement" of collectivist anarchists, then that's why you would need another article with an alternative name. Anarchism is commonly thought of, first and foremost, as a set of philosophical positions. We shouldn't let a few POV'ers corrupt the meaning of the term to mean a "social movement" (by social movement I take it that they mean people demonstrating in the streets and/or throwing bombs) which necessarily consists only of collectivists anarchists, and necessarily excludes individualist anarchism and anarcho-capitalism. That's highly non-standard, and "original research." <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 00:08, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>CNT? FAI? Nabatniki? Who died at Genoa? Who made Prague into a good showing or a bloody nightmare (depending on your political views)? Who was blamed over Seattle? Who fought the German police in the 1980s? Who died at Haymarket? Anarchism's common usage refers to a social movement. Even within academic disciplinary political studies (three disciplines to mention: Politics, Political Economy and Social History), anarchism refers to a myasma of theory only in the first*, and to a social movement in the two second. [*The obvious critique of the disciplinary methods of politics in the West needs not to be given, the methodological presumptions against engaging social movements is obvious.

<dd>Encyclopedia Britannica says anarchism is "a cluster of doctrines and attitudes centred on the belief that government is both harmful and unnecessary." If that widely-disemminated and popular dictionary does not give the most common understanding of what is meant by "anarchism" then I don't know what does. Anarchism is most commonly regarded as referring to IDEAS ..PHILOSOPHY. Anarchism is philosophy.

<dd>Britannica is not a dicationary. Nor is any encyclopedia considered to be of sufficient quality to base any assertion and substantiate it*. Encyclopedia are created with reference to primary sources, and secondary sources of disciplinary qualities, not by reference to other encyclopedia*.

[*Obvious exception: assertions and encyclopedia entries directly related to encyclopedia as a topic.]
<dl>
<dd>A riot in Genoa has absolutely no influence on what anarchism means. A riot is a riot. A riot of anarchists is a riot of anarchists. Rioting itself is not anarchism.

<dd>If anyone, including any mediator, wants to see my positions they can in these discussion pages. I'm not going to rehash everything to a mediator. All this debate is getting really pointless. Actually, there may be a point to it. The point is to drag this out interminably and keep the biased article protected from being edited as long as possible isn't it? Wikipedia policy says that pages should not be protected "very long." This page has been protected for "very long." The protection, at this point, has become a violation of Wikipedia policy, and if not POV motivated, surely gives the outward appearance of a POV-motivated lockdown designed to keep a biased article from being neutralized. Wikipedia is supposed to be a place where anyone can edit an article. After this length of time, this lockdown is contrary to the spirit of Wikipedia. I refuse to take part in prolonging the lockdown, here or in mediation. If, and when, the article is unlocked, then I'll be back to edit it.<a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 22:34, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am really really tired of this debate. I started out editing anarchism on wikipedia because it was immediately the topic that interested me. However, I find myself devoting most if not all of my internet time to this article, when I would really like to be working on other articles. I don't want the article protected forever, either, but it's not going to get unprotected until we can work this out. Also, even if you are not with the Libertarian party per se, your admission of association (Hogeye) still shows that we have two unreconcilable POV's to work out. Mine and yours. How does it affect the definition of anarchism? I don't see why you're opposed to mediation...it's just part of the wikipedia process--it's not like they will TELL us what to do. Are you afraid of mediation because you are willfully making false claims, claims that you know to be false, only for propagandistic purposes? Only zealots ignore what they know to be true in order to promate what they want to be true -- if you are not a zealot, and truly believe in your own arguments, why not enter into mediation? If you claim to represent truth, then what do you have to lose? --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbamuth_eea6.html" title="User:Albamuth">albamuth</a> 08:57, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>mediation is often more about compromise than truth, although perhaps it will do a better job of achieving balance than the various polls and RfCs to, which are even less about truth, but if the mediation isn't binding, what progress have we made? Not only has the mediation process been inactive for months, I doubt it's decisions would be respected here. The text of your request for mediation, was a distortion, and a dismissal of the positions you disagree with, just as your poll questions on the issues were. The lack of intellectual honesty which makes mediation necessary, probably also makes it doomed to fail.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 09:21, Jun 26, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Question:</b> In 50 words, more or less, what do you object to, in the article in its present protected state?</p>
<p><b>Answers:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>It's protected, I think protected articles are contrary to wikipedian principles. <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedant_30ce.html" title="User:Pedant">Pedant</a> 21:06, 2005 Jun 25 (UTC)</li>
<li>The POV definition of anarchism. All other objections follow from that. E.g. the omission of various schools, mischaracterization of what anarchists think/believe. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 22:39, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>That it's an article about one particular meaning of anarchism, referring to a specifically anti-capitalist movement, rather than about the broad range of philosophies that can be considered anarchist under a more inclusive definition. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan*</a> 01:17, Jun 26, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Its dissimilarity w articles on the topic which can be found elsewhere, and that this dissimilarity is based on a wikipedian socialist POV lobby, rather than more balanced references than other sources. This article is proof of failings of both the wiki ideals and anarchism. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">¸,ø¤º°`°º¤ø,¸</a><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESam_Spade_3418.html" title="User talk:Sam Spade">¸,ø¤º°`°º¤ø,¸</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Emailuser&amp;target=Sam_Spade" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Emailuser&amp;target=Sam_Spade" rel="nofollow">¸,ø¤º°`°º¤ø,¸</a> 01:23, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The article is not balanced between the two main schools of anarchism, the individualist and the collectivist with prominent mention of anarcho-capitalism in the individualist camp. This lack of balance gives the impression that the well written history and origins of anarchism are "owned" by the collectivist school. The lack of recognition of this primary divide between the individualist and collectivists, does not provide a proper location for the key issues that divide them. Is property coercive and is collectivism (which seems to require some kind of enforcement) coercive? --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 06:46, Jun 26, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>It could use some polish here and there, but basicly it's a good article written in a neutral style. Considering how many different branches of anarchism there are it does a good job covering them all. // <a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELiftarn_fddd.html" title="User:Liftarn">Liftarn</a></li>
<li>I have no problems with the range of topics it covers, but would rather that anarchism be presented via <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolutionary_epistemology.html" title="Evolutionary epistemology">evolutionary epistemology</a>, to show the development and addition of ideas. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbamuth_eea6.html" title="User:Albamuth">albamuth</a> 18:36, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>So you don't mind discussing the evolution of anti-statist liberalism into anarchism (e.g. Bastiat, Molinari,) and the evolution of socialist anarchism into anarcho-capitalism in the 20th century? <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 28 June 2005 14:19 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Just like in evolution, some branches of the meme-pool are dead-ends, and never become a permanent part of it. Unlike biological evolution, influences and sources for the ideas (memes) can be positive, negative (as a reaction against), or even complementary (parallel but not conflicting concepts). For the article, it is not necessary to list every author that influenced anarchist writers (even Isaac Newton would be mentioned), but those authors that framed the concepts that the anarchist movement inculcated and retained. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbamuth_eea6.html" title="User:Albamuth">albamuth</a> 29 June 2005 03:34 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, what you call "socialist anarchism" never developed into "anarcho-capitalism." To delineate direct relation of one writer's ideas to another, you have to look at whom they cite and refer to. In the absence of citation (original research), you must see if that writer's ideas became part of the memeplex for what we are describing (anarchism). Does Rothbard draw on the tradition of previous anarchist writers? Is there a movement that follows his ideas? If they call themselves anarcho-capitalists, but no anarchists follow those ideas, then it is fair to say that the anacho-capitalist movement follows Rothbard's ideas and that anarchists do not. Therefore, an article about a social movement that expouses a political philosophy called anarchism need not mention Rothbard, but an article about anarcho-capitalism should. Theory: if in <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a> speciation occurs when two segments of a population become so differentiated that they cannot breed together, then in <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_philosophy.html" title="Political philosophy">political philosophy</a> speciation occurs when two segments of a social movement become so at odds that they cannot purposefully collaborate/agree (take the SWP and the IWW, for example). Caveat: ideologies are not species and memes are not genes, therefore their origination and evolution is not fully analogous. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbamuth_eea6.html" title="User:Albamuth">albamuth</a> 29 June 2005 04:17 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It looks to me like Godwin, and even Proudhon to some degree, evolved from classical liberalism. Anti-statist liberalism, Proudhon's mutualism, and Bakunin's socialism are all strains of anarchism. Tucker took some of Bakunin's exploitation theory, and a lot of Herbert Spencer's moral theory, mixed in some Ayn Rand, I mean Max Stirner egoism, creating individualist anarchism. Later, Rothbard synthesized individualist anarchism and Austrian economics to get modern anarcho-capitalism. Your focus, Alba, on only one strain exposes your biased POV. At any rate, it's clear that a history-only article would not break the impasse. It just reframes the issue from "what is the definition of anarchism" to "what should be included in the history of anarchism." <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 29 June 2005 07:21 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Why the current article is far superior to the one being pushed by POV warriors</span></h2>
<p>In particular problems include: (1) the template, which is skewed to over-emphasize anarcho-capitalism and indicates not only that anarcho-capitalism is a form of anarchism (which is a point of contention), but that it is a form of individualism (which is another point of contention) (2) Its claim to take no point of view on which philosophies are a form of anarchism, when in fact the forms of categories it displays and its presentation is biased to the anarcho-capitalist position that they are a form of anarchism. (3) its timeline, which labels someone who never considered himself an anarcho-capitalist as such, and falsely labels bakunin the first anarcho-socialist when many consider mutualism to be a form of socialism, (4) its inclusion of Molinari in the development of modern anarchism, when in fact molinari was not identified with the anarchist movement until the anarcho-capitalists came about 100 years later and revisited history to claim him, (5) its political chart, which is blatantly AC pov that puts Tucker and Proudhon inbetween socialism and capitalism despite the fact that Tucker called himself a socialist, and implies that anarcho-capitalism is in fact a form of anarchism or that capitalism is compatible with anarchism, two claims that defy the history of anarchism and are under contention, (5) its claim that individualist feminism is a form of anarchism, when in fact many individualist feminists are not anarchists, (6) its inclusion of anarcho-capitalism in "schools of anarchism", when it should be placed separately, (7) its heavily biased individualist anarchist section, which along with the individualist anarchism article have been under the control of anarcho-capitalists of late, (8) its "anarchist schools chart", which oversimplifies and misrepresents aspects of both collectivist anarchism (most do not believe in crime) and individualist anarchism (their support of both land and property is qualified, and it is not neutral to claim that this answer is either simpy "yes" or "no", further, Tucker did believe in expropriation in certain instances), (9) the ridiculous contention that anarchists support polycentric law, part of the problem of including anarcho-capitalism outside its own section which misrepresents anarchism as a whole in order to cater to a small sub-movement hostile to anarchist tradition, (10) the ludicrious claim that the "capitalism vs. socialism" is the most controversial conflict between anarchists, when in fact anarchists by and large ignore anarcho-capitalism as an irrelevant attempt to subvert their tradition, further, the presentation in that section is obviously from AC pov (11) the linking of Tucker with panarchism, (12) the inclusion of several sections dealing specifically with AC perspectives, which are already detailed in their article and over-emphasize a relatively small movement, (13) its inclusion of an entire section dedicated to anarcho-capitalist books, which would be as silly as putting such a section in there for all possible anarchist sub-movements and claimaints, and again over-emphasizes anarcho-capitalism, (14) the general tone and direction of the article, whose main purpose is so obviously to emphasize the personally favored philosophy of its editors that it would be hard for them to deny without appearing to be either total idiots or complete ideologues.</p>
<p>For all of these reasons I will not accept any attempt to overwrite the current article, the product of years of work, with this heavily POV anarcho-capitalist replacement. Now will I stand by as such a highly biased piece of writing is used to try to alter the current article which is -more- than fair to this particular sub-movement given its standing in regards to traditional anarchism. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 30 June 2005 03:54 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Most of Kev's points are redundant, i.e. are simply different formulations of the core definitional dispute: 1,2,6,10,12,13, and 14.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(3) and (4) Kev makes the error of ignoring the definition of anarchism and ignoring ideas closely related to anarchism (anti-state liberalism), with the flimsy excuse that so-and-so did not <i>self-refer</i> as an anarchist. Strangely, Kev doesn't mind that William Godwin never refered to himself as an anarchist, but he <i>does</i> mind Molinari. POV? You make the call.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(5) By the modern definition of socialism and capitalism, Proudhon (and mutualists in general) have some similarities and dissimilarities to each. See the chart comparing anarcho-socialism to individualist anarchism to anarcho-capitalism. Clearly, mutualism is somewhere between socialism and capitalism, with some features of each.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(7) Kev has a history of trying to put a detailed individualist anarchism article within other articles, rather than a few essentials and a link to IA.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(8) Kev makes the ridiculous claim that most collectivist anarchists "do not believe in crime." Let's check the veracity of that claim:</dd>
<dd>"Powerful states can maintain themselves only by crime, little states are virtuous only by weakness." - Bakunin</dd>
<dd>"Have not prisons - which kill all will and force of character in man, which enclose within their walls more vices than are met with on any other spot of the globe - always been universities of crime?" - Kropotkin</dd>
<dd>Maybe Kev meant that most bald punkers with circle-A tatoos believe that. I dunno.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(9) Kev: "...the ridiculous contention that anarchists support polycentric law."</dd>
<dd>Kev must have misread. The article reads, "While some anarchists reject organized defense of liberty outright, many have proposed forms of polycentric law."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(11) Kev: "the linking of Tucker with panarchism"</dd>
<dd>Again, a misreading of the article. It does not link Tucker with panarchism at all. It links Tucker with tolerance. E.g. Tucker's article in Liberty praising Auberon Herbert as an anarchist. Herbert was pro-capitalism by the way.</dd>

<dd>As it happens, I agree with most of Kev's criticisms. Vis a vis 4) Molinari could readily be included and be described as a "close predecessor" of pro-capitalism anarchists. I don't necessarily agree with 7), as Kev has his own POV when it comes to "bias" on individualist anarchism. Regarding 8), I wonder whether it is really a good idea to continue thinking of "individualist anarchism" exclusively in terms of Tucker; are there really no other individualists worth citing? I'm also not sure about 11) (I really have no idea), and 14) is entirely a judgment call. - <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Kraus</a><a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">e</a> 30 June 2005 04:37 (UTC)

<dd>As I explained above, I don't think precursors of any faction should be included in the general history. First, because they are only precursors of particular factions and this is a general history, they can all be put on their own pages. Second, because these claims tend to be controversial. Third, because it would overload the history with a lot of factional speculation and inevitably lead to edit wars. If we must include some precursors in the history, and we might as well, they should be ones for anarchism in general, rather than any claimed by only one or two factions. Other than that, only people who actually refered to themselves as anarchists should be in the history.</dd>

<dd>I do have my own bias when it comes to individualism, my bias is that their works not be misrepresented to make it appear that they supported things that they in fact rejected wholesale. I believe in staying true to their memory, I find it distrubing that people can claim their tradition while at the same time ignoring it. I agree that Tucker should not be the sole indicator of individualism, but neither should sweeping statements about individualism be made when they disagree with the views of any particular individualist. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 1 July 2005 17:18 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Kev, I think we officially win, RJ has stooped to the Sam Spade level of argumentation, that is to say, interjections of capitalized internet slang&#160;:P (two personal attacks in one comment, oh yeah - i'm just kidding folks). Anyway I think the issue is very, very obvious at this point so I'm not going to get worked up with any more silly arguments. I agree wholeheartedly with Kev's sentiments. --<a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETothebarricades.tk_2bb0.html" title="User:Tothebarricades.tk">Tothebarricades</a> June 30, 2005 11:22 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is a suggestion on it's talk page that it get moved to <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchist-communism.html" title="Anarchist-communism">Anarchist-communism</a>.. what do people think - Is it anglo vs american usage of the term? -<a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMax_rspct_e7d2.html" title="User:Max rspct">max rspct</a> 30 June 2005 14:10 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It really doesn't matter, so long as one redirects to the other. It's just another synonym, like "libertarian communism." <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 30 June 2005 14:25 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well it does matter to some extent.. But yo reaction is predictable, in light of your vaunting of 'left anarchism' and 'anarcho-socialism' (misleading, made-up words.. very rarely used except by detractors) The article should use the most widely used word - and redirect from the other one. -<a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMax_rspct_e7d2.html" title="User:Max rspct">max rspct</a> 30 June 2005 17:27 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't use the term "left-anarchism," since <i>all</i> anarchism, including anarcho-capitalism, is left - i.e. opposes the <i>ancien regime</i> aka the existing State. Cf: <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard33.html" class="external text" title="http://www.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard33.html" rel="nofollow">Left and Right: The Prospects for Liberty</a> by Murray Rothbard. I consider "left anarchism" and "right anarchism" to be commie terminology used by anarcho-socialists like Ulrike Heider ("Anarchism: Left, Right, and Green.) I have never ever heard a market anarchist self-refer as "right anarchist." <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 30 June 2005 20:06 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I've never heard someone today call themself an anarchist-communist, when people identify that way, the dominant term today is anarcho-communist. There's also libertarian communist and free communist (however practically no one uses these anymore). If they're going to integrate the two articles, put them all in anarcho-communism. --<a href="../../../f/a/t/User%7EFatal_5ada.html" title="User:Fatal">Fatal</a> 30 June 2005 19:47 (UTC)</p>
