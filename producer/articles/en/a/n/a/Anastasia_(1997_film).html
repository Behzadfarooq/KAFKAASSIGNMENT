Young Anastasia receives the music box from Marie.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The palace is now under siege. Anastasia and Marie are saved by Dimitri, a servant boy, who ushers them through a hidden door in the wall. Anastasia drops her music box in the panic, and Dimitri is knocked out when soldiers storm the room. Anastasia and Marie manage to escape the palace, and are running to catch a train. Rasputin to try to kill Anastasia, however, he loses his grip and falls into the freezing water, where he supposidely dies. Now climbing on the train, Anastasia loses her grip on her grandmother's hand and falls to the platform, hitting her head. Marie is forced to continue.</p>
<p>Ten years later, Russia is now under <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist.html" title="Communist">Communist</a> rule. The possibility Anastasia has survived the revolution is beginning since her body was not found. Marie, now residing in Paris, has offered a reward for anyone who can restore her granddaughter to her. Two Russian conmen, Dimitri (now a handsome and conniving young man in his early twenties) and Vladimir (a former aristocrat of the Imperial Court) jump at the opportunity. Together, they devise a scheme that includes finding a young girl to pass off as Anastasia.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a young woman known only as Anya, is living at an orphanage outside St. Petersburg. The nameless eighteen-year-old owns the necklace Marie gave to Anna before the Revolution. Anya has no memories of the first eight years of her life. At eight, she was found wandering around St. Petersburg and subsequently sent to the orphanage. Anya travels to St. Petersburg to buy a ticket to Paris, but is denied since she does not have an exit visa, which she can get from Dimitri. Dimitri and Vladimir are struck by Anya's resemblance to the young Grand Duchess and quickly realizes that he and Vlad have found their "fake" Anastasia. Dimitri lies to Anya, telling her that he has an extra ticket to Paris, but it is reserved for the Grand Duchess herself. He and Vlad "explain" that they want to restore the young princess to her family, and Anya agrees to accompany them.</p>

Anya and the ghosts of the Imperial court during the "Once Upon a December" number.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Up in the rafters of the building, Bartok, a small albino bat lingers with Rasputin's idle reliquary. The reliquary suddenly wakes up, snatching Bartok and racing to the limbo, a sphere between life and death. Bartok finds Rasputin, who is unable to die because Anastasia is still alive. Rasputin declares that he will send his minions to chase after Anastasia and kill her before she reaches Paris, allowing his revenge to finally be settled.</p>
<p>Anya, Dimitri, Vladimir, and Anya's newly christened dog Pooka board a train bound for Paris, but are forced to hide in the baggage car after Vlad unsuccessfully attempts to forge their tickets and visas. Rasputin's minions try to kill Anya, but thanks to Dimitri's quick thinking, the train slows down and the trio can jump. Rasputin, furious that his plan has failed, comes up with a new, crueler idea. It is revealed that his very existence relies on his <a href="../../../r/e/l/Reliquary.html" title="Reliquary">reliquary</a>, which Bartok thoughtlessly tries to break it.</p>
<p>Now, Anya discovers she has to actually prove she is the Grand Duchess to Sophie, the Dowager Empress's cousin. Dimitri and Vlad begin to teach her everything she'll need to know to be Anastasia. Upon arriving in Germany, the trio boards a steamer bound for Paris.</p>
<p>That night, as Anya sleeps, the minions infiltrates her dreams. While her mind wanders, her body rises from its bed and outside to the deck, where the ship is in the middle of a violent storm. Pooka awakes to find his mistress gone and rouses Dimitri, who chases Anya. He spots her standing on the railing of the ship; Anya is about to jump in the water. Dimitri distracting her momentarily and pulls Anya back on deck and awakens her - weeping in his arms, she cries out about the Romanov curse, something neither of them understands.</p>

</div>
<p>Back in <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limbo.html" title="Limbo">limbo</a>, Rasputin realizes that the only way to kill Anya is to do it himself, in person. Meanwhile, Anya and company arrive in France's capital, just as the Dowager Empress declares that she will see no more girls claiming to be Anastasia. However, Sophie allows an interview with Anya as a favor to Vlad. Anya plays her part well, but when Sophie asks her how she escaped the siege on the palace, Vlad becomes nervous and Dimitri crestfallen, as it is a detail only the "real" Anastasia knows. However, to their great fortune, a memory surfaces. She recalls a boy who opens a wall. Anya believes it to be nonsense, but Dimitri is shocked by what this signifies.</p>
<p>Sophie determines a way for Anya to encounter Marie is at the Russian ballet's performance of <i><a href="../../../c/i/n/Cinderella.html" title="Cinderella">Cinderella</a></i>. Dimitri is saddened since he has finally found his princess, but he knows that he'll have to let her go to her family. Later, Dimitri tells Vlad about Anya's memory and that <i>he</i> was in fact that little boy, meaning their Anya was the real Anastasia.</p>

</div>
<p>When the ballet ends Dimitri takes Anya to see the Dowager Empress. Anya overhears the conversation, learning that Dimitri was only using her in a con to get Marie's money. Desperate, Dimitri kidnaps the Empress, shows her the music box and implores the Empress to talk to Anya. The Empress reluctantly complies, and they soon discover the truth - Anya recognizes both the Empress's peppermint hand oil and the music box, and Anya is finally reunited with her family.</p>
<p>Marie meets Dimitri again in her study with the promised reward money, but Dimitri declines; he's had a change of heart, a gesture that deeply moves her. She now recognizes him as the servant boy. As he finally leaves he runs into Anya, who is preparing for her reintroduction celebrations. Dimitri neglects to mention that he didn't take the money, leading her to believe he's still the heartless conman he was in St. Petersburg (though it is evident that she has developed feelings for him). Dimitri then finds Vlad, who had now been reinstated as an aristocrat and tries one last time to convince him to stay. But Dimitri's stance is firm - he will not interfere with Anya's destiny.</p>
<p>On the night of the ball, Anya looks out at the dancing crowd, searching for Dimitri. Sophie tells Anya of Dimitri's gesture, leaving Anya confused and full of questions. Pooka wanders into the bushes, led by Rasputin who tried to kill Anya on the Alexander Bridge over an icy <a href="../../../s/e/i/Seine.html" title="Seine">Seine</a>.</p>
<p>Dimitri returns to save Anya, his love for Anya having compelled him to stay. He tries to drag Anya to safety, but is distracted by a statue which Rasputin has brought to life. Pooka snatches the reliquary and rolls it to Anna, who cracks it. Rasputin recoils in horror, knowing its destruction will destroy him. The statue shatters and a heavy piece of rock falls on Dimitri, knocking him to the ground. Anya stomps on the reliquary until it breaks, and Rasputin disintegrates into dust, his remains blowing away. His soul returns to Hell from whence it came.</p>

<p>Anya rushes to Dimitri, who she believes is dead. He comes to and they <a href="../../../r/e/c/Reconcile.html" title="Reconcile">reconcile</a>. They are about to kiss, but Pooka interrupts, holding Anya's tiara in his mouth. Dimitri reminds Anya that the aristocracy of Russia are waiting for her, but Anya has something else in mind.

Anya and Dimitri board a small steamer with Pooka, on which they finally kiss. Their elopement, Sophie sighs as she reads the note, is a perfect ending. Marie disagrees: "It's a perfect beginning."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bartok (having left Rasputin during the Final Showdown), happy to see Anastasia and Dimitri together, does a little jig. Then, a female version of his kind appears to him and they share a kiss.</p>

<p>The film opened in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_14.html" title="November 14">November 14</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a> and across the world on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_21.html" title="November 21">November 21</a>. It debuted and peaked at number two at the North American <a href="../../../b/o/x/Box_office.html" title="Box office">box office</a> and grossed over <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_dollar_db5c.html" title="United States dollar">US$</a>58,403,000 dollars; the worldwide gross totalled $139,801,000, making it Don Bluth's most successful film to date.</p>
<p>As a musical in the vein of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Disney_animated_features_c5c3.html" title="List of Disney animated features">Disney animated features</a>, the film is notable for being one of Bluth's most critically acclaimed works, and for being one of the few animated features produced in the 2.35:1 widescreen aspect ratio. (The film is officially credited as using <a href="../../../c/i/n/CinemaScope_6b7c.html" title="CinemaScope">CinemaScope</a> per Bluth's wishes, but the format is actually a regular anamorphic film and did not use CinemaScope optics, which had been retired for 30 years by the release of <i>Anastasia</i>.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>)</p>
<p><i>Anastasia</i> was nominated for two <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_Awards_b109.html" title="Academy Awards">Academy Awards</a> in the categories of "<a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_Award_for_Original_Music_Score_4b11.html" title="Academy Award for Original Music Score">Best Music, Original Musical or Comedy Score</a>" and "<a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_Award_for_Best_Song_4475.html" title="Academy Award for Best Song">Best Music, Original Song</a>" for "Journey to the Past".

<p>As a fairy-tale style adaptation of the legend of the Russian grand duchess Anastasia, the film imagines that Anastasia, daughter of <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicholas_II_of_Russia_61a9.html" title="Nicholas II of Russia">Nicholas II of Russia</a>, escapes the Imperial Palace during the <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_Revolution_dcce.html" title="October Revolution">October Revolution</a> and survives the execution of the Imperial family. The film took several liberties with the details of historical events, and some <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Orthodox_Church_72f2.html" title="Eastern Orthodox Church">Orthodox Christians</a> were offended due to the historical Anastasia's sainthood, which was declared formally the following year. Some of the differences with actual history include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Though the body of two members of the Russian Imperial Family, including one of the daughters, have not been found, there is no evidence that any family members, including Anastasia, survived, although there have been many claims to survival. The most famous of these was <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_Anderson_e443.html" title="Anna Anderson">Anna Anderson</a>, whose story inspired the original 1956 <i><a href="../../../a/n/a/Anastasia_%281956%29.html" title="Anastasia (1956)">Anastasia</a></i> film on which this film is based, although this film doesn't actually deal with Anderson directly.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In the film, Rasputin curses the Royal Family, bringing about the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Revolution_of_1917_c160.html" title="Russian Revolution of 1917">Russian Revolution</a>. The real leaders of the Revolution (first <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Kerensky_fc25.html" title="Alexander Kerensky">Alexander Kerensky</a>, then <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vladimir_Lenin_a39d.html" title="Vladimir Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a>) are not portrayed. <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grigori_Rasputin_66ee.html" title="Grigori Rasputin">Grigori Rasputin</a> was a religious mystic, who washed infrequently and was often drunk. Nevertheless, he gained the trust of the Tsarina <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandra_Fyodorovna_of_Hesse_d151.html" title="Alexandra Fyodorovna of Hesse">Alexandra</a> when he seemed to alleviate the symptoms of <a href="../../../h/e/m/Hemophilia.html" title="Hemophilia">hemophilia</a> from which her son <a href="../../../t/s/a/Tsarevich_Alexei_Nikolaevich_of_Russia_513a.html" title="Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich of Russia">Alexei</a> suffered. All the evidence points to Rasputin's support of the royal family, though (as many have argued) with the intent being to gain power for himself. However, in a letter written just before his death, he <i>predicted</i> the Russian Revolution, based not on any mystical powers, but on simple observation of political facts.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Judging by his letters and those of the Tsarina, Rasputin was always careful to be polite and even affectionate to the members of the royal family, although by other accounts he spoke disparagingly of them to others and made lewd remarks about the Grand Duchesses. In any event, the family were deeply saddened by his death. By the account of one of the assassins at <a href="../../../y/e/k/Yekaterinburg.html" title="Yekaterinburg">Yekaterinburg</a>, the Empress and the Grand Duchesses were wearing little pins with an iconic portrait of Rasputin at the time of their death, showing they believed he would be a saint.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Rasputin's death was a result of being frozen in ice; this followed an overdose of poison, several knife and gun wounds, and being thrown several stories onto the ice. A group of nobles plotted to kill him due to his growing influence over the Tsar and, particularly, the Tsarina. It is entirely likely Rasputin's film death was shown intentionally as drowning was the least violent of the above mentioned methods of death and the studio was attempting to downplay the violence in order to be as family-oriented as such film would allow. Also, the film shows Rasputin as trying to capture the Empress Dowager and Anastasia near the frozen river Neva, but the ice is too thin to support his weight.</li>

<li>The film depicts Anastasia as escaping from the Imperial Palace during the Revolution, when in fact she stayed with her family, living at first in <a href="../../../t/s/a/Tsarskoe_Selo_8f26.html" title="Tsarskoe Selo">Tsarskoe Selo</a> and later in <a href="../../../t/o/b/Tobolsk.html" title="Tobolsk">Tobolsk</a> in Siberia until they were executed by a squad of <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolshevik.html" title="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a> secret police under <a href="../../../y/a/k/Yakov_Yurovsky_74af.html" title="Yakov Yurovsky">Yakov Yurovsky</a> in <a href="../../../i/p/a/Ipatiev_House_ec42.html" title="Ipatiev House">Ipatiev House</a>, <a href="../../../y/e/k/Yekaterinburg.html" title="Yekaterinburg">Yekaterinburg</a> in a period from <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_16.html" title="July 16">July 16</a> to <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_17.html" title="July 17">July 17</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In the film, Anastasia is only a young child (the film states she is eight) at the time of the Revolution, when in fact, she was four months shy of 16 years old. Anastasia was born on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_18.html" title="June 18">June 18</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/0/1901.html" title="1901">1901</a>.</li>

She lived in Russia until 1920, when she evacuated the Crimea with <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Civil_War_dc1c.html" title="Russian Civil War">White</a> forces, and thereafter in her native <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denmark.html" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>.

</ul>
<ul>
<li>At the beginning of the film - 1916, the hanging ornament marked "300" in the ball room implies it is the celebration of the Romanov tercentenary, when the trecentenary was in 1913.</li>

<p>Bluth and Goldman, who did extensive historical research on the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Duchess_Anastasia_Nikolaevna_of_Russia_b47d.html" title="Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia">Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia</a> and the Russian Revolution for the film, never intended for their film to be scrupulously analyzed for historical accuracy; their film is based upon the legend of <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Duchess_Anastasia_of_Russia_2d7c.html" title="Grand Duchess Anastasia of Russia">Anastasia</a> having survived the slaughter of the family. A disclaimer can be found at the end of the credits for the film. It reads as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"While some of the characters and events depicted in this film were inspired by well-known historical figures and events, the portrayal of such characters and the depiction of such events are fictional. All other characters and incidents portrayed and names used were created for the purpose of fictitious dramatization and any similarity to the names, characters, and history of actual persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental and unintentional."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Coincidentally, this now-standard disclaimer was created in the aftermath of a scandal and lawsuit brought by Prince <a href="../../../f/e/l/Felix_Yusupov_c436.html" title="Felix Yusupov">Felix Yusupov</a> -- the man who is most often credited with the murder of Rasputin -- in 1932, against <a href="../../../m/g/m/MGM_7545.html" title="MGM">MGM</a> for their film <i>Rasputin and the Empress</i>, which took enormous artistic liberties with the available facts.</p>
<p>The film is based on the play from the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a> by Marcelle Maurette adapted by <a href="../../../g/u/y/Guy_Bolton_a78a.html" title="Guy Bolton">Guy Bolton</a> and turned into the film <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anastasia_%281956%29.html" title="Anastasia (1956)">Anastasia (1956)</a> which was based on the legend of <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Duchess_Anastasia_of_Russia_2d7c.html" title="Grand Duchess Anastasia of Russia">Grand Duchess Anastasia of Russia</a> surfacing as "<a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_Anderson_e443.html" title="Anna Anderson">Anna Anderson</a>".</p>
<p>Dimitri was probably portrayed by <a href="../../../g/l/e/Gleb_Botkin_91a6.html" title="Gleb Botkin">Gleb Botkin</a> and Pooka, Anya's fictional dog, as the real Anastasia's spaniel, Jimmy.</p>

<ul>
<li>It has been noted that Anastasia and her grandmother are the only members of the Romanov family who are prominently featured in the film. However, it is also possible that the Dowager Empress, who outlived Nicholas II by ten years, was despondent over the murder of both of her son and his bride together, and may have remembered Alexandra more fondly.</li>
<li>In 2002, the film's songwriters admitted that the musical number, <i>In the Dark of the Night</i>, was in fact inspired by <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Little_Mermaid_%281989_film%29_3c31.html" title="The Little Mermaid (1989 film)">The Little Mermaid's</a> <i>Poor Unfortunate Souls.</i><sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since April 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></li>
<li>There are many similarities between <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lion_King_5b05.html" title="The Lion King">The Lion King's</a> and <i>Anastasia</i>. Both songs, <i>Be Prepared</i> and <i>In the Dark of the Night</i>are sung by the film's chief villain, who plans to kill the protagonist. Anastasia and Simba are lost children who are the only legitimate heirs to the throne. Both Rasputin and <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scar_%28The_Lion_King%29_f090.html" title="Scar (The Lion King)">Scar</a> have minions who sing the chorus, and they even have similar color schemes (with long black hair and brown robes/fur, as well as a predominantly green backdrop to the number). To top it off, both Scar and Rasputin's singing voices are provided by <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Cummings_f300.html" title="Jim Cummings">Jim Cummings</a>, although Cummings only provided the vocals for a small part of <i>Be Prepared</i> after Jeremy Irons' voice gave out.</li>
<li>The musical number <i>Paris Holds the Key (To Your Heart)</i> includes cameos by various historical figures from the time, including <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maurice_Chevalier_7444.html" title="Maurice Chevalier">Maurice Chevalier</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigmund_Freud_d2be.html" title="Sigmund Freud">Sigmund Freud</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Lindbergh_87dc.html" title="Charles Lindbergh">Charles Lindbergh</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josephine_Baker_3d15.html" title="Josephine Baker">Josephine Baker</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claude_Monet_c04a.html" title="Claude Monet">Claude Monet</a>, <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isadora_Duncan_4321.html" title="Isadora Duncan">Isadora Duncan</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/g/Auguste_Rodin_e687.html" title="Auguste Rodin">Auguste Rodin</a>, and <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gertude_Stein_a61d.html" title="Gertude Stein">Gertude Stein</a>.</li>
<li>As with many Don Bluth films, the characters carry some of their voice actors' physical and personality traits. It was stated in <i>The Art of Anastasia</i> that one half of Anya's face is made to look like Meg Ryan and the other half like <a href="../../../a/u/d/Audrey_Hepburn_bca7.html" title="Audrey Hepburn">Audrey Hepburn</a>.</li>
<li>The Parisian bridge on which the confrontation between Rasputin, Dimitri, and Anya occurs is the <a href="../../../p/o/n/Pont_Alexandre_III_f502.html" title="Pont Alexandre III">Alexander III bridge</a>, named after the real Anastasia Romanov's grandfather on the occasion of his state visit to France in the 1870s.</li>
<li>The drawing the Empress holds when she and Anya are reminiscing (the same one we see little Anastasia give her at the beginning of the movie) is a picture the real Anastasia had drawn for her father in 1914.</li>
<li>The portrait in the ballroom of the whole family includes a dog. The dog existed. This spaniel named Joy belonged to Anastasia's brother, Alexei, and was found alive at the house where the family was killed. Anastasia's dog, Jimmy, did not survive.</li>
