<p>The word <i>anarchy</i> derives from the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_language.html" title="Greek language">Greek</a> roots <i>an-</i> (without, not) and <i>-arch</i> (ruler, authority, first; cf. <i>-archy</i>). More precisely, the term comes from <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Latin_8bb0.html" title="New Latin">New Latin</a>'s <i>anarchia</i>, which is from Greek's <i>anarkhia</i>, which in turn comes from <i>anarkhos</i> ("without a ruler": <i>an-</i>, without; + <i>arkhos</i>, ruler). Within this article, the term anarchism is understood as meaning "without rulers", "without government", or "without hierarchy" -- as opposed to "no rules", which some argue is the correct <a href="../../../t/r/a/Translation.html" title="Translation">translation</a>. The first known usage of the word is traced to the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Revolution_970a.html" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a> (c.<a href="../../../1/7/8/1789.html" title="1789">1789</a>), when it was used as a <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insult.html" title="Insult">derogatory</a> term against <a href="../../../l/e/f/Left-wing_politics.html" title="Left-wing politics">the left</a>. The <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">French</a> <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">philosopher</a> <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon_876a.html" title="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a> is considered to have been the first to refer to himself as an "anarchist", which he did in a non-derogatory fashion, becoming the first to articulate a social philosophy that called itself <i>anarchism'.</i></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Talk%7EAnarchism_Old_version_f39b.html" title="Edit section: What is Anarchism?">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">What is Anarchism?</span></h2>
<p>Anarchist ideologies can generally be divided into "<a href="../../../l/e/f/Left-wing_politics.html" title="Left-wing politics">left</a>" and "<a href="../../../r/i/g/Right-wing_politics.html" title="Right-wing politics">right</a>", occupying opposing positions within the conventional political spectrum. What does unite these different branches of anarchism is their aversion to <a href="../../../t/o/t/Totalitarianism.html" title="Totalitarianism">totalitarianism</a>. Because there is no central definition or authority on what anarchism is (much like any other <a href="../../../i/d/e/Ideology.html" title="Ideology">ideology</a>) there are a number of different versions and definitions of anarchist theory; while two people may both call themselves anarchists, their personal ideologies may differ <i>immensely</i>. There is, however, common ground between the various strands that can be referred to as "anarchism": generally opposition to the state. This article will seek to describe and compare the various strands, their common ground and their differences.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Talk%7EAnarchism_Old_version_f39b.html" title="Edit section: Anarchy is Not Anomie">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Anarchy is Not Anomie</span></h2>
<p>To add to the confusion, the word "anarchist" is often used to describe a troublesome or violent individual -- a usage that stems from the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Revolution_970a.html" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a> of the <a href="../../../1/7/9/1790s.html" title="1790s">1790s</a>. Today, this comes partly form a popular definition of anarchy as involving chaos and disorder -- what some scholars refer to by <a href="../../../e/m/i/Emile_Durkheim_64fd.html" title="Emile Durkheim">Durkheim</a>'s <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sociology.html" title="Sociology">sociological</a> term "<a href="../../../a/n/o/Anomie.html" title="Anomie">anomie</a>" (absence of standards, values or order) -- and partly from the use of political violence and "<a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda_by_the_deed.html" title="Propaganda by the deed">propaganda by the deed</a>" which a minority of anarchists use and advocate, though mostly in the <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a>. Most anarchists oppose such actions as <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assassination.html" title="Assassination">assassination</a>; however, many do advocate <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crime.html" title="Crime">crimes</a> against <a href="../../../p/r/o/Property.html" title="Property">property</a> and accept violence in <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self_defence.html" title="Self defence">self defence</a>. Some anarchists advocate <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacifism.html" title="Pacifism">pacifism</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-violence.html" title="Non-violence">non-violence</a>, arguing that it is possible to 'fight' a <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peace.html" title="Peace">peaceful</a> <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolution.html" title="Revolution">revolution</a>.</p>
<p>Anomie is often confused with anarchism, as opponents of anarchism try to give the belief system a negative connotation. Anomie is not advocated by the anarchist traditions discussed below, although it has been embraced by some <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counterculture.html" title="Counterculture">countercultural</a> elements; anarchists believe that the government is a source of disorder and that society would be more orderly -- and less violent -- without governments. Anarchism could thus be seen as "<a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalism.html" title="Nationalism">anti-nationalist</a>". While it might seem that "anarchism" implies a total lack of <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law.html" title="Law">law</a>, most anarchists believe that organised structures <i>should</i> exist in society, but that these should be created in a way such that coercive hierarchies cannot develop. This is why <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_facto.html" title="De facto">de facto</a> <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchist_law.html" title="Anarchist law">anarchist legal systems</a> exist in anarchies functioning today. This understanding is reflected in the phrase: <i>Anarchy does not oppose rules, it does oppose rulers</i>.</p>

<p>Rejection of coercive authority can be traced as far back as <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_China_7047.html" title="Ancient China">Ancient China</a>, where <a href="../../../t/a/o/Taoism.html" title="Taoism">Taoism</a> is declared by some to have been the oldest example of anarchist doctrine<a href="http://www.tao.ca/thinking/texts/taoanarch.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tao.ca/thinking/texts/taoanarch.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. In the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_world.html" title="Western world">West</a>, a similar tendency can be traced to the philosophers of <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greece_e4c9.html" title="Ancient Greece">Ancient Greece</a>, such as <a href="../../../z/e/n/Zeno_of_Citium_f74b.html" title="Zeno of Citium">Zeno</a>, the founder of the <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stoic_philosophy.html" title="Stoic philosophy">Stoic philosophy</a>, and <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristippus.html" title="Aristippus">Aristippus</a>, who said that the wise should not give up their <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberty.html" title="Liberty">liberty</a> to the state<a href="http://www.blackcrayon.com/page.jsp/library/britt1910.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.blackcrayon.com/page.jsp/library/britt1910.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Later movements -- such as the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_Spirit_2b3d.html" title="Free Spirit">Free Spirit</a> in the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Ages_99b9.html" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anabaptist.html" title="Anabaptist">Anabaptists</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Diggers_67a0.html" title="The Diggers">The Diggers</a> -- have also expounded ideas that have been interpreted as anarchist.</p>
<p>In fact, some anarchists assert that anarchism is not so much a movement as an historical tendency; indeed, <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mikhail_Bakunin_11a1.html" title="Mikhail Bakunin">Bakunin</a> saw thought and rebellion as the principal tenets of <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_nature.html" title="Human nature">human nature</a> as well as of anarchism. However, there was certainly no coherent ideology that called itself "anarchism" until the <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">nineteenth century</a>, when anarchism -- then often referred to simply as "Revolutionary Socialism" -- sprouted from the growth of <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialism.html" title="Socialism">socialism</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">communism</a>. This line of anarchist thought can be more accurately called <i><a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarian_socialism.html" title="Libertarian socialism">libertarian socialism</a></i>.</p>

<p>There is a wide variety of anarchist doctrines, some advocating, for example, communism and others advocating capitalism, but all of them advocate that the best form of government is that which governs "not at all," to quote <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_David_Thoreau_badf.html" title="Henry David Thoreau">Henry David Thoreau</a> in his essay <i><a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_Disobedience_8993.html" title="Civil Disobedience">Civil Disobedience</a></i>.</p>
<p>This page will give a summary overview of the various anarchist theories and their interaction. For a more in-depth look at the principles, history and development of an individual theory, see the articles specifically on that theory.</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarian_socialism.html" title="Libertarian socialism">libertarian socialists</a></b> intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controlled and collectively-owned organizations;</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalists</a></b> promote individual <a href="../../../p/r/o/Property_rights.html" title="Property rights">property rights</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_market.html" title="Free market">free market</a> as the basis for society, and equate the intervention of political power with oppression and robbery;</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../i/n/d/Individualist_anarchism.html" title="Individualist anarchism">individualist anarchists</a></b> insist above all on individual freedom from the state.</li>
</ul>
<p>Among these major branches there are sub-branches of theory, mainly divided up by their focus on certain issues (special forms of repression), <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strategy.html" title="Strategy">strategy</a> or <a href="../../../t/a/c/Tactics.html" title="Tactics">tactics</a>.</p>

<p>One notable sub-branch is the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_%28economics%29.html" title="Labour (economics)">labour</a>-oriented <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-syndicalism.html" title="Anarcho-syndicalism">anarcho-syndicalists</a>, which focuses on labour issues and struggles for workers' rights as strategies that will bring about an anarchist society, and the <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_strike.html" title="General strike">general strike</a> as a favoured tactic.</p>
<p><a name="Eco-Anarchy" id="Eco-Anarchy"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Talk%7EAnarchism_Old_version_f39b.html" title="Edit section: Eco-Anarchy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Eco-Anarchy</span></h2>
<p>There is a significant anarchist element to the <a href="../../../e/n/v/Environmental_movement.html" title="Environmental movement">environmental movement</a>, including those that are known as <a href="../../../e/c/o/Eco-anarchism.html" title="Eco-anarchism">eco-anarchists</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_anarchism.html" title="Green anarchism">green-anarchists</a>. These two, though similar, are not quite the same because the political label '<a href="../../../g/r/e/Green.html" title="Green">Green</a>' has implications beyond <a href="../../../e/c/o/Ecology.html" title="Ecology">ecology</a> (see <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Party_0a10.html" title="Green Party">Green Party</a>). Green anarchists accept some restrictions on individual freedom as a means of preserving <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_capital.html" title="Natural capital">natural capital</a> (for example, <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farmland.html" title="Farmland">farmland</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water.html" title="Water">water</a>) and often promote limited forms of <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_ecology.html" title="Social ecology">social ecology</a>. Eco-anarchists, by contrast, are more extreme and advocate a sort of fusion with nature (<i>see also</i>: <a href="../../../e/c/o/Eco-village.html" title="Eco-village">eco-village</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primitivism.html" title="Primitivism">primitivism</a>).</p>
<p>Green anarchism, in <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a> at least, is also linked with <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-primitivism.html" title="Anarcho-primitivism">anarcho-primitivism</a>, a philosophy that calls for the abolition not only of government, but of <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civilisation.html" title="Civilisation">civilisation</a>. On the opposite end of the technology spectrum are some that have been labelled <a href="../../../c/y/b/Cyberpunk.html" title="Cyberpunk">cyberpunks</a> -- those who see <a href="../../../i/n/f/Information_technology.html" title="Information technology">information technology</a> as the way to replace hierarchy, defeat monopoly, and prevent war, and support <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_jamming.html" title="Culture jamming">culture jamming</a> in particular as a way to do so.

(In fact, many anarchists see anarchism as inevitable, as the present organisation of society is unsustainable and unsteady, and will eventually give way to anarchist <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolution.html" title="Revolution">revolution</a>; this view is particularly prevalent amongst anarchist communists, hailing back to <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Marx_3bcc.html" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a>' theory that communist revolution -- involving the <a href="../../../w/o/r/Working_class.html" title="Working class">working class</a> -- was inevitable.)</p>

Some anarchafeminists even characterise government as a <a href="../../../m/a/l/Male.html" title="Male">male</a> dominated and biased institution and many advocate anarchistic forms of <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matriarchy.html" title="Matriarchy">matriarchy</a>.

<p>The diversity of anarchist movements seems very likely to increase, as advocates of particular strains continue to interact in various ways, ways which are increasingly facilitated by modern <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communication.html" title="Communication">communications</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transport.html" title="Transport">transport</a> <a href="../../../t/e/c/Technology.html" title="Technology">technologies</a>. Having stated that, it would be interesting to examine the view of anarcho-primitivists in regards to the "benefits" of technology upon the anarchist movement.</p>
<p>While the above doctrines all support political decentralization, some may find it hard to see how these paradigms could happily coexist. One popular perception is that the anarchist movement has suffered, and continues to suffer, from internal divisions and conflicts. Partly such conflict results because most anarchists reject the idea of <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanguardism.html" title="Vanguardism">vanguard</a> groups and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_party.html" title="Political party">political parties</a> (as they are argued to be authoritarian by nature). Even anarcho-syndicalists and anarcho-communists, who normally work side by side (a good example is during the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Civil_War_7a30.html" title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a>), have come into conflict in some regions, notably in <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>, where there has been a historical division between the two groups <a href="http://www.spunk.org/library/places/japan/sp001883/japchap2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.spunk.org/library/places/japan/sp001883/japchap2.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, as opposed to the historical alliance which has been seen elsewhere.</p>
<p>Division is not seen as a problem for most anarchist theorists, who see diversity as an advantage, akin to <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biodiversity.html" title="Biodiversity">biodiversity</a>. Many argue that despite divisions and conflicts, the ultimate goal of each anarchist remains the -- that of eliminating government from society.</p>

<p>The theory and ideas behind libertarian socialism developed in <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a> and <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>, and then extended to the Americas (notably <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuba.html" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>), most notably through the migration of <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spaniards</a>, <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italians</a> and Russians. Since then the movement has grown, with anarchist groups and individuals appearing all over the world, in locations such as <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentina.html" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>.</p>
<p>Major advocates of anarchism, in the period before <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>, included <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leo_Tolstoy_eb79.html" title="Leo Tolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</a> (though he never called himself an anarchist), <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon_876a.html" title="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a> (the first to call himself an anarchist), <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Kropotkin_48a3.html" title="Peter Kropotkin">Peter Kropotkin</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mikhail_Bakunin_11a1.html" title="Mikhail Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</a>. Their writings revolved around <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism.html" title="Atheism">atheism</a> (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and co-operative economics based on <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutual_aid.html" title="Mutual aid">mutual aid</a>. Anarchist <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labor_union.html" title="Labor union">labor unions</a> were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education and other institutions were made. <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mikhail_Bakunin_11a1.html" title="Mikhail Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</a>, one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, instigated a split in the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_International_5bd2.html" title="First International">First International</a> (an organisation of anarchist, communist and socialist groups) by his disagreements with <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Marx_3bcc.html" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a>. This began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and authoritarian communists.</p>
<p>Libertarian socialism had what some historians regard to have been its last outburst in the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Civil_War_7a30.html" title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a>, when anarchist groups like the <a href="../../../c/n/t/CNT_ae46.html" title="CNT">CNT</a> (a workers' organisation) took part in a revolution triggered by an attempted <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">fascist</a> <a href="../../../c/o/u/Coup_d%27%C3%A9tat.html" title="Coup d'état">coup</a>. The anarchists, a mixture of anarcho-syndicalists and anarcho-communists, played a major part in the following events, and had significant popular support (the CNT's membership was well over one million). However, by the end of the war, anarchist groups were regarded as enemies by both the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>-supported Spanish Communist Party, whom they were allied with against the fascist Rebel <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Franco_9db7.html" title="General Franco">General Franco</a>, and the fascist forces themselves. The loyalists (anarchists, communists and socialists) had lost the war by 1939, and Franco's government reigned until his death in 1975. Anarchism in Spain was consequently suppressed, although various groups survive, including the CNT.</p>

<p>Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a "normal" way to promote or impose their views, even in the presence of governments they hate.

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Talk%7EAnarchism_Old_version_f39b.html" title="Edit section: Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism</span></h4>
<p>Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.</p>
<p>Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that such coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, as evidenced by the consent to a contract that each party was free to refuse, and that any external power capable of preventing such relationship is itself oppressive coercion to be fought.</p>
<p>Some commentators frame this debate as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anarcho-socialists (libertarian socialists) believe that all forms of ierarchy must be eliminated.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Anarcho-capitalists believe that all forms of coercion must be eliminated, but that apparent hierarchy is no coercion, as long as it reflects a freely-entered-into contract.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the "weakness and ignorance" referred to above, or the <a href="../../../w/a/g/Wage_slave.html" title="Wage slave">wage slave</a> concept referred to in socialist literature).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves. Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all. They also argue that while someone may not be able to refuse to work, one has the largest choice of employers with the diversity of a free market economy, and that a given employer/employee contract is no coercion.</li>
</ul>
<p>The relationship between these two groups is antagonistic at best: many left-anarchists find it hard to characterise anarcho-capitalists as anarchists at all, and anarcho-capitalists see left-anarchists as state-communists who reject the word "state" but support political coercion under other names.</p>
<p>Socialist anarchists and anarcho-capitalists don't generally engage in any form of co-operation, despite what might appear to be a mutual goal (i.e. getting rid of the state), whereas anarchists of each kind share a lot of litterature and cooperate with the non-anarchists in their respective <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialism.html" title="Socialism">socialist</a> and <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical_liberalism.html" title="Classical liberalism">classical liberal</a> traditions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Individualist anarchists, by contrast, do not generally have much interest in this debate. They believe the most important thing is to do away with government, and that how individuals choose to organise themselves and their social group economically is up to them. Debates such as this one, they feel, are a waste of time.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Green anarchists think that without some provision for a centralized and organized concept of fairness, and for <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consensus_decision_making.html" title="Consensus decision making">consensus decision making</a>, social organizations will tend to fall apart in conflict with themselves. Debates such as this one, they feel, are central, and some limited form of <a href="../../../d/e/l/Deliberative_democracy.html" title="Deliberative democracy">deliberative democracy</a> must exist to air these views.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Eco-anarchists prefer lower-overhead processes and smaller-scale organizations, and at most would accept a very limited <a href="../../../b/i/o/Bioregional_democracy.html" title="Bioregional democracy">bioregional democracy</a> to ensure that entities like watersheds had some respect from humans. But they would reject debates across such actual/natural boundaries, assuming that people living in different places will have different ideas, and in that sense are more like individual anarchists.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Feminist anarchists would support some interventions to enable women to contribute, and specifically provide them with a voice men don't have. They would argue that male tendencies to strut, show off, fight, kill and interrupt women breaks up any male-run social organization in the long run, and subjects women and children to the risks of conflict.</li>

<p>There are several anarchist thinkers, such as <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Tucker_454b.html" title="Benjamin Tucker">Benjamin Tucker</a>, <a href="../../../l/y/s/Lysander_Spooner_53a2.html" title="Lysander Spooner">Lysander Spooner</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Stirner_aa58.html" title="Max Stirner">Max Stirner</a>, who are known as <i>individualist anarchists</i>. Beyond economic issues of collectivism versus capitalism, they insist on individual <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberty.html" title="Liberty">liberty</a> and absence of coercion from states.</p>
<p>Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches. They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See <a href="../../../i/n/d/Individualist_anarchism.html" title="Individualist anarchism">individualist anarchism</a> for a discussion of this issue.</p>
<p>On the debate of capitalism versus socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making their own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.</p>

<p>According to this definition of anarchies, those functioning during the first decade of the <a href="../../../2/1/s/21st_century.html" title="21st century">21st century</a> include computer-based communities such as <a href="../../../u/s/e/Usenet.html" title="Usenet">usenet</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indymedia.html" title="Indymedia">Indymedia</a>, the <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_b7e8.html" title="GNU">GNU</a>/<a href="../../../l/i/n/Linux.html" title="Linux">Linux</a> community, the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a>.</p>

<p><i><b>Disclaimer:</b></i> Of course, this topic has been grossly over-simplified for the purposes of creating a well-rounded, comprehensive, and encyclopedic article on anarchism.
