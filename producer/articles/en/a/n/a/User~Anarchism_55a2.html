<dd><i>"It's an odd feature of the anarchist tradition over the years that it seems to have often bred highly authoritarian personality types, who legislate what the Doctrine IS, and with various degrees of fury (often great) denounce those who depart from what they have declared to be the True Principles. Odd form of anarchism." --Noam Chomsky</i></dd>

<p><br />
<b>Anarchism</b> is a range of political views whose name is derived from the <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a> word <i><a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchia.html" title="Anarchia">anarchia</a></i> which was first employed in translating <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristotle.html" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>'s Greek term <i><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%B1%CF%81%CF%87%CE%AF%CE%B1" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:αναρχία">αναρχία</a></i> the privative prefix αν <i>an-</i> "without" is combined with αρχία <i>arkhê</i> — meaning "command" or "rule"). Thus anarchism, in the most generally understood sense of the term, refers to any political position or belief that is opposed to all manifestations of rule or domination. Thus, in theory, anarchism, in its various forms, is opposed to all instances of enforced or representational government — including the <a href="../../../s/t/a/State.html" title="State">State</a> — and instead favours social relations that are voluntarily and freely established among individuals.</p>
<p>Anarchism comprises various <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_philosophy.html" title="Political philosophy">political philosophies</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_anarchist_organizations.html" title="List of anarchist organizations">political organisations</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_movement.html" title="Social movement">social movements</a> that advocate the elimination of the <a href="../../../s/t/a/State.html" title="State">State</a>, and what are believed to be authoritarian social and economic relationships. In the place of centralized political and economic structures these movements favor social relations based upon what are seen as voluntary relationships. These philosophies use <i><a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchy.html" title="Anarchy">anarchy</a></i> to mean a <a href="../../../s/o/c/Society.html" title="Society">society</a> based on <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volunteer.html" title="Volunteer">voluntary</a> interaction of <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_%28political%29.html" title="Freedom (political)">free</a> individuals. Philosophical anarchist thought does not advocate <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaos.html" title="Chaos">chaos</a> or <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anomie.html" title="Anomie">anomie</a> — it refers to "anarchy" as a manner of human relations that is intentionally established and maintained.</p>
<p>There is considerable variation among the anarchist political philosophies. Opinions differ in various areas, such as whether <a href="../../../v/i/o/Violence.html" title="Violence">violence</a> should be employed to foster anarchism, what type of economic system should exist, whether <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_hierarchy.html" title="Social hierarchy">social hierarchy</a> or unequal wealth distribution is opposed, questions on the environment and industrialism, and anarchists role in various movements. Also, throughout history various anarchists of particular schools of anarchism have claimed that other particular schools, to which they do not subscribe, are not forms of anarchism.</p>

<p>In the hunter-gatherer period before recorded <a href="../../../h/i/s/History.html" title="History">history</a>, human society lived mainly in super-families. Thus there was no <a href="../../../s/t/a/State.html" title="State">State</a>, little accumulated wealth or division of labour, and no decreed law or rulers. One might call this primitive anarchy.</p>
<p>Some anarchists have embraced <a href="../../../t/a/o/Taoism.html" title="Taoism">Taoism</a>, which developed in <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_China_e66b.html" title="History of China">Ancient China</a>, as a source of anarchistic attitudes <a href="http://www.toxicpop.co.uk/library/taoism.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.toxicpop.co.uk/library/taoism.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Similarly, anarchistic tendencies can be traced to the philosophers of <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greece_e4c9.html" title="Ancient Greece">Ancient Greece</a>, such as <a href="../../../z/e/n/Zeno_of_Citium_f74b.html" title="Zeno of Citium">Zeno</a>, the founder of the <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stoic_philosophy.html" title="Stoic philosophy">Stoic philosophy</a>, and <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristippus.html" title="Aristippus">Aristippus</a>, who said that the wise should not give up their <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberty.html" title="Liberty">liberty</a> to the state <a href="http://www.blackcrayon.com/page.jsp/library/britt1910.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.blackcrayon.com/page.jsp/library/britt1910.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Later movements – such as <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stregheria.html" title="Stregheria">Stregheria</a> in the 1300's, the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_Spirit_2b3d.html" title="Free Spirit">Free Spirit</a> in the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Ages_99b9.html" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anabaptist.html" title="Anabaptist">Anabaptists</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Diggers_67a0.html" title="The Diggers">The Diggers</a>, and the Ranters, – have also expounded ideas that have been interpreted as anarchist.</p>
<p>The first known usage of the word <i>anarchy</i> appears in the play <i><a href="../../../s/e/v/Seven_Against_Thebes_c4e2.html" title="Seven Against Thebes">Seven Against Thebes</a></i> by <a href="../../../a/e/s/Aeschylus.html" title="Aeschylus">Aeschylus</a>, dated <a href="../../../4/6/7/467_BC_aeb7.html" title="467 BC">467 BC</a>. There, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antigone.html" title="Antigone">Antigone</a> openly refuses to abide by the rulers' decree to leave her brother Polyneices' body unburied, as punishment for his participation in the attack on <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thebes_%28Greece%29_0c1f.html" title="Thebes (Greece)">Thebes</a>, saying that "even if no one else is willing to share in burying him I will bury him alone and risk the peril of burying my own brother. Nor am I ashamed to act in defiant opposition to the rulers of the city (<i>ekhous apiston tênd anarkhian polei</i>)".</p>
<p>Ancient Greece also saw the first western instance of anarchism as a philosophical ideal, in the form of the <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stoicism.html" title="Stoicism">stoic</a> philosopher <a href="../../../z/e/n/Zeno_of_Citium_f74b.html" title="Zeno of Citium">Zeno of Citium</a>, who was, according to <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Kropotkin_48a3.html" title="Peter Kropotkin">Kropotkin</a>, "[t]he best exponent of Anarchist philosophy in ancient Greece". As summarized by Kropotkin, Zeno "repudiated the omnipotence of the state, its intervention and regimentation, and proclaimed the sovereignty of the moral law of the individual". Within <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_philosophy.html" title="Greek philosophy">Greek philosophy</a>, Zeno's vision of a free community without government is opposed to the state-<a href="../../../u/t/o/Utopia.html" title="Utopia">Utopia</a> of <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plato%27s_Republic_09f4.html" title="Plato's Republic">Plato's Republic</a>. Zeno argued that although the necessary instinct of self-preservation leads humans to <a href="../../../e/g/o/Egotism.html" title="Egotism">egotism</a>, nature has supplied a corrective to it by providing man with another instinct — <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialization.html" title="Socialization">sociability</a>. Like some modern anarchists, he believed that if people follow their instincts, they will have no need of law, <a href="../../../c/o/u/Courts.html" title="Courts">courts</a>, or <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police.html" title="Police">police</a>, no <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temple.html" title="Temple">temples</a> and no public <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worship.html" title="Worship">worship</a>, and use no <a href="../../../m/o/n/Money.html" title="Money">money</a> (a <a href="../../../g/i/f/Gift_economy.html" title="Gift economy">gift economy</a> taking the place of the exchanges). Zeno's beliefs have only reached us as fragmentary quotations. <a href="http://www.blackcrayon.com/page.jsp/library/britt1910.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.blackcrayon.com/page.jsp/library/britt1910.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>
<p>The <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anabaptist.html" title="Anabaptist">Anabaptists</a> of <a href="../../../1/6/t/16th_century.html" title="16th century">16th century</a> Europe are sometimes considered to be religious forerunners of modern anarchism. <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bertrand_Russell_85bc.html" title="Bertrand Russell">Bertrand Russell</a>, in his <i><a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Western_philosophy_373b.html" title="History of Western philosophy">History of Western Philosophy</a></i>, writes that the Anabaptists "repudiated all law, since they held that the good man will be guided at every moment by <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Holy_Spirit_69cb.html" title="The Holy Spirit">the Holy Spirit</a>...[f]rom this premise they arrive at communism...."

<p>It should be noted that an essay explicitly advocating the absence of government ("<a href="http://oll.libertyfund.org/Texts/LFBooks/Burke0061/Vindication/0339_Bk.html" class="external text" title="http://oll.libertyfund.org/Texts/LFBooks/Burke0061/Vindication/0339_Bk.html" rel="nofollow">A Vindication of Natural Society</a>") was written and published anonymously in 1756 by <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmund_Burke_4d22.html" title="Edmund Burke">Edmund Burke</a> -- a man widely acknowledged to be the founding-father of modern <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservatism.html" title="Conservatism">Conservatism</a>. Upon discovery that he was the author of the anonymous essay, Burke dismissed the writing as satire. There is some conflict involved over the sincerity of Burke's dismissal of "Vindication..."; a most notable contribution to the debate is Murray Rothbard's 1958 essay <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard11.html" class="external text" title="http://www.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard11.html" rel="nofollow">"Edmund Burke, Anarchist."</a> Other anarchists, such as Godwin and Tucker, have been known to consider the essay to be an important contribution to their philosophy.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/7/9/1793.html" title="1793">1793</a> <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Godwin_a3c4.html" title="William Godwin">William Godwin</a> published <i><a href="http://web.bilkent.edu.tr/Online/www.english.upenn.edu/jlynch/Frank/Godwin/pjtp.html" class="external text" title="http://web.bilkent.edu.tr/Online/www.english.upenn.edu/jlynch/Frank/Godwin/pjtp.html" rel="nofollow">An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice</a></i>, in which he presented his vision of a free society alongside a critique of government. Some consider this the first anarchist treatise, calling Godwin the "founder of philosophical anarchism"<a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/godwin/" class="external autonumber" title="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/godwin/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. Other than the spontaneous association that may arise when individuals defend each other from aggressors, Godwin opposes every kind of cooperation in labor among individuals (even orchestras are opposed). He is an early proponent of <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberalism.html" title="Liberalism">liberalism</a>, supporting a right of an individual to own property, defining it as "the empire to which every man is entitled over the produce of his own industry," but advocating that individuals voluntarily share their surplus property with those who have a need for it.</p>
<p><a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon_876a.html" title="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a> of <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, author of "<a href="http://ns52.super-hosts.com/~vaz1net/bill/anarchism/library/WhatIsProperty/" class="external text" title="http://ns52.super-hosts.com/~vaz1net/bill/anarchism/library/WhatIsProperty/" rel="nofollow">What is Property?</a>" in <a href="../../../1/8/4/1840.html" title="1840">1840</a> was the first individual to call himself an "anarchist." Proudhon advocated a non-coercive market economy where individuals would trade the produce of their labor. Exchange value of goods within such an economy was to be determined by the amount of labor exerted in their production. Proudhon did not use the term "property" in a consistent way. While he is famous for saying "property is theft" in early writings, at that time he was defining property as anything that was not the product of labor (e.g. unused land) that was held by individuals and was protected by government force. Titles granted to land that was not in use by the owner would allow individuals to charge rent to others who wished to use it, which Proudhon opposed. Later, he began using the term "property" to refer to the ownership of produce of labor, which he strongly supported. Proudhon held that property was an essential element of liberty: "Where shall we find a power capable of counter-balancing the... State? There is none other than property... The absolute right of the State is in conflict with the absolute right of the property owner. Property is the greatest revolutionary force which exists" (<i>Theory of Property</i>) He opposed profit in all economic transactions, viewing it as being paid without laboring --labor being the sole source of legitimate property. He coined the term "<a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutualism_%28economic_theory%29.html" title="Mutualism (economic theory)">mutualism</a>" to label the theoretical economic system where goods and services would be traded without profit. He preferred the abolition of government, but he did not believe that its total elimination was possible, so advocated its minimization: "...the institutions of the police, preventative and repressive methods officialdom, taxation etc., are reduced to a minimum..."</p>
<p><a href="../../../j/o/s/Josiah_Warren_9645.html" title="Josiah Warren">Josiah Warren</a>, an American, and a coeval of Proudhon's, authored an individualistic philosophy of a similar nature to Proudon's that explicitly opposed the existence of government (though they worked without apparent knowledge of each other). Warren had been writing about and practicing an economic system based on the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labor_theory_of_value.html" title="Labor theory of value">labor theory of value</a> by which exchange was facilitated by the medium of "<a href="../../../l/a/b/Labor_notes.html" title="Labor notes">labor notes</a>." This was the practical exercise of the mutualist economic system that Proudhon later theorized. Many consider the periodical that Warren published and edited beginning in 1833, called <i>The Peaceful Revolutionist</i>, to be the first anarchist periodical. Individualists, taking much from the writings of <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Stirner_aa58.html" title="Max Stirner">Max Stirner</a>, among others, emphasized to the utmost extent the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberty.html" title="Liberty">liberty</a> of the individual. While some individualists looked to <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_law.html" title="Natural law">natural law</a> to justify individualism, Stirner's "Egoism" held that <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-interest.html" title="Self-interest">self-interest</a> is the only legitimate justification for action.</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical_liberalism.html" title="Classical liberalism">Liberals</a> were often labeled "anarchists" by <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarchy.html" title="Monarchy">monarchists</a>, even though they did not call for the abolition of the State. Still, they did promote the idea of a minimal State, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Individual_rights.html" title="Individual rights">individual rights</a>, and the responsibility of the people to judge their governments, which provided a groundwork for the development of anarchist thought. "<a href="http://ns52.super-hosts.com/~vaz1net/bill/anarchism/library/thelaw.html" class="external text" title="http://ns52.super-hosts.com/~vaz1net/bill/anarchism/library/thelaw.html" rel="nofollow">The Law</a>" (1849) by <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederic_Bastiat_b786.html" title="Frederic Bastiat">Frederic Bastiat</a> is a good example of an anti-statist liberal tract. A clear precursor of <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalism</a> was <a href="../../../g/u/s/Gustave_de_Molinari_f4ee.html" title="Gustave de Molinari">Gustave de Molinari</a>, who wrote about private defense agencies in <a href="http://praxeology.net/GM-PS.htm" class="external text" title="http://praxeology.net/GM-PS.htm" rel="nofollow">The Production of Security</a> (1849). This was one of the first attempts to solve the problem of security in a stateless manner. In the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, anarchist thoughts were expressed in the writings of <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_David_Thoreau_badf.html" title="Henry David Thoreau">Henry David Thoreau</a> (<a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_Disobedience_8993.html" title="Civil Disobedience">Civil Disobedience</a>), Josiah Warren, and Benjamin Tucker. Individualist anarchists such as Tucker were influenced by the writings of <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbert_Spencer_e7b1.html" title="Herbert Spencer">Herbert Spencer</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Stirner_aa58.html" title="Max Stirner">Max Stirner</a>, among others. The American tradition of individualist anarchism is firmly in support of individual sovereignty, private property, wages, and a free market economy. However, they see violations of "<a href="../../../c/o/s/Cost_the_limit_of_price.html" title="Cost the limit of price">cost the limit of price</a>" (based in the labor theory of value) as exploitative, and as a result oppose profit in all economic relations. Nevertheless, they will allow it to occur if the result of contract --contract being the ultimate source of law. Their position on profit is that it would be near impossible if government ceased to exist, due to release of privileged capital and proliferation of competition.</p>
<p>Later in the <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a>, anarchist theorists like <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mikhail_Bakunin_11a1.html" title="Mikhail Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchist_communism.html" title="Anarchist communism">Anarchist communists</a> like <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Kropotkin_48a3.html" title="Peter Kropotkin">Peter Kropotkin</a> took a slightly different stance on how to establish the utmost liberty of the individual. They drew from the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marxism.html" title="Marxism">Marxist</a> critique of capitalism and came to the conclusion that workplaces and economic production under capitalism were unavoidably authoritarian and exploitative, suppressing the liberty of the individual just as much, if not more than the State. They argued that both capitalism and the State needed to be abolished and replaced with more democratic ways of living and producing. Furthermore, they argued that gift economies were preferable to free market systems, although Bakunin was less ardent about this point than about workplace democracy (see <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cooperative.html" title="Cooperative">cooperative</a>).</p>
<p>In short, Bakunin and Kropotkin emphasized the importance of a communal perspective to maintain individual liberty in a social context, and the critical role of workers self-managed organs of production and creation. The <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Workingmen%27s_Association_361b.html" title="International Workingmen's Association">International Workingmen's Association</a> was an organisation of workers, including both anarchists and Marxists. Both sides had a common aim (stateless communism) and common political opponents (conservatives and other right-wing elements). But each was critical of the other, and the inherent conflict between the two groups soon embodied itself in an ongoing argument between <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mikhail_Bakunin_11a1.html" title="Mikhail Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</a>, representative of anarchist ideas, and <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Marx_3bcc.html" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a> himself. Generally Marx wanted to work within the system, use hierarchical organizational structures, and run people in elections. Bakunin hated these ideas, and predicted that if a revolution were won under a Marxist revolutionary party, they would end up being as bad as the <a href="../../../r/u/l/Ruling_class.html" title="Ruling class">ruling class</a> that they fought against. However, <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mikhail_Bakunin_11a1.html" title="Mikhail Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</a> saw a need to defend the <a href="../../../w/o/r/Working_class.html" title="Working class">working class</a> against oppression and overthrow the ruling class, and he predicted that democratic committes would arise in future revolutionary periods and fulfill this role. Nevertheless, in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1872.html" title="1872">1872</a>, the conflict in the First International climaxed with the expulsion of Bakunin and those who had become known as the "Bakuninists" when they were outvoted and outmanouvered by the Marx's supporters at the <a href="../../../h/a/g/Hague_Congress_%281872%29_b1e7.html" title="Hague Congress (1872)">Hague Congress</a>. This is often cited as the origins of the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_and_Marxism_d262.html" title="Anarchism and Marxism">conflict between anarchists and Marxists</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Kropotkin_48a3.html" title="Peter Kropotkin">Peter Kropotkin</a>'s <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchist_communism.html" title="Anarchist communism">anarchist communism</a> developed from his <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science.html" title="Science">scientific</a> theory based on <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a> in which co-operation equalled or surpassed competition in importance, as illustrated in <i><a href="../../../a/_/f/Mutual_Aid%7E_A_Factor_in_Evolution_553a.html" title="Mutual Aid: A Factor in Evolution">Mutual Aid: A Factor in Evolution</a></i> (<a href="../../../1/8/9/1897.html" title="1897">1897</a>).</p>
<p>Some <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolution.html" title="Revolution">revolutionaries</a> of this time such as the <a href="../../../n/i/h/Nihilist.html" title="Nihilist">Nihilists</a> encouraged acts of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda_by_the_deed.html" title="Propaganda by the deed">political violence</a> such as <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bomb.html" title="Bomb">bombings</a> and the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assassination.html" title="Assassination">assassinations</a> of <a href="../../../h/e/a/Head_of_state.html" title="Head of state">heads of state</a> to further anarchism. However, these actions were regarded by many anarchists as counter-productive or ineffective (see "<a href="#Violence_and_non-violence" title="">Violence and non-violence</a>", below).</p>
<p>In the late <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-syndicalism.html" title="Anarcho-syndicalism">anarcho-syndicalism</a> developed as the industrialized form of <i>libertarian communism</i>, emphasizing <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_action.html" title="Industrial action">industrial actions</a>, especially the <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_strike.html" title="General strike">general strike</a>, as the primary strategy to achieve anarchist revolution, and "build the new society in the shell of the old".</p>
<p>Anarchists played a major role in many of the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_movement.html" title="Labour movement">labour movements</a>, uprisings, and <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolution.html" title="Revolution">revolutions</a> of the late <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th</a> and early <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th centuries</a>, including the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Revolution_of_1917_c160.html" title="Russian Revolution of 1917">Russian Revolution of 1917</a>. In the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, many new <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immigrant.html" title="Immigrant">immigrants</a> were anarchists; an especially notable group was the large number of <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jewish</a> immigrants who had left <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a> and <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Europe_ef2f.html" title="Eastern Europe">Eastern Europe</a> during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These groups were disrupted by the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Scare_c4d0.html#The_first_Red_Scare" title="Red Scare">Red Scare of 1919</a>. <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emma_Goldman_57e3.html" title="Emma Goldman">Emma Goldman</a> was a very influential anarchist and feminist during this period. She traveled the country and the world spreading anarchist ideas and attempting to live an anarchist life.</p>
<p>The anarcho-syndicalist orientation of many early American labor unions played a large part in the formation of the American <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_spectrum.html" title="Political spectrum">political spectrum</a>. The United States is the only industrialized former British colony to not have a labor-based political party. In Mexico, anarcho-syndicalists like <a href="../../../r/i/c/Ricardo_Flores_Mag%C3%B3n_d420.html" title="Ricardo Flores Magón">Ricardo Flores Magón</a> led various revolts and uprisings that would help overthrow the dictator Diaz, lead the way for the growth of anarchism in <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_America_2c96.html" title="Latin America">Latin America</a>, and also go on to influence the modern day <a href="../../../z/a/p/Zapatista.html" title="Zapatista">Zapatista</a> rebellion.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>, in the first quarter of the 20th century, anarchist movements achieved relative, if short-lived, successes and were violently repressed by states. In the United States anarchist organisations were given a crushing blow during the "<a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Scare_c4d0.html" title="Red Scare">Red Scare</a>" (1919-20). However, in the 1920s and 1930s the conflict between anarchism and the state was eclipsed by the one between <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_democracy.html" title="Liberal democracy">liberal democracy</a>, <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">fascism</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalinism.html" title="Stalinism">stalinism</a>, which ended with the defeat of the <a href="../../../a/x/i/Axis_Powers_169f.html" title="Axis Powers">Axis Powers</a> in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a>, years of social, political and religious turmoil coupled with decades of anarchist <a href="../../../a/g/i/Agitation.html" title="Agitation">agitation</a> and organisation led to class conflict. The old <a href="../../../r/u/l/Ruling_class.html" title="Ruling class">ruling class</a> (church, army and monarchy) and capitalists were horrified by the new freedoms and social changes within the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Spanish_Republic_b8a3.html" title="Second Spanish Republic">Second Spanish Republic</a>. So an army rebellion or <a href="../../../c/o/u/Coup_d%27%C3%A9tat.html" title="Coup d'état">coup d'état</a> was initiated so as to regain control of the country. The <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Civil_War_7a30.html" title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a> (1936-1939) as it became known, pitched the ruling class and fascists against the middle-class liberals and politicised workers. In reponse to the army rebellion <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_in_Spain_f47b.html" title="Anarchism in Spain">an anarchist-inspired</a> peasant and workers movement (supported by militias initially tolerated by the republic) took control of huge areas of urban and rural Spain (including most major <a href="../../../c/i/t/City.html" title="City">cities</a>) in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1936.html" title="1936">1936</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/3/1937.html" title="1937">1937</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collectivization.html" title="Collectivization">collectivized</a> the land. Along with the <a href="../../../p/o/u/POUM_a91b.html" title="POUM">POUM</a>, they were eventually suppressed by the Stalinist-controlled republican army, which later lost to <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francisco_Franco_4235.html" title="Francisco Franco">Franco</a>'s army in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a>.

<p>A surge of popular interest in anarchism occurred during the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a>. In the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">UK</a> this was associated with the <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_rock.html" title="Punk rock">punk rock</a> movement; the band <a href="../../../c/r/a/Crass.html" title="Crass">Crass</a> is celebrated for its anarchist and <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacifism.html" title="Pacifism">pacifist</a> ideas. In <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denmark.html" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>, the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freetown_Christiania_82af.html" title="Freetown Christiania">Freetown Christiania</a> was created in downtown <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copenhagen.html" title="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>. The housing and employment crisis in most of <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Europe_1e16.html" title="Western Europe">Western Europe</a> led to the formation of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communes.html" title="Communes">communes</a> and squatter movements like the one still thriving in <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barcelona.html" title="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, in <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catalonia.html" title="Catalonia">Catalonia</a>. Militant <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antifa.html" title="Antifa">resistance to neo-Nazi groups</a> in places like Germany, and the uprisings of <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autonomous_Marxism_6611.html" title="Autonomous Marxism">autonomous Marxism</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/t/Situationist.html" title="Situationist">situationist</a>, and <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autonomist.html" title="Autonomist">Autonomist</a> groups in France and Italy also helped to give popularity to anti-authoritarian, non-capitalist ideas.</p>
<p>Beginning in the later part of the 20th century anarchist <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primitivism.html" title="Primitivism">primitivists</a> like <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Zerzan_d08a.html" title="John Zerzan">John Zerzan</a> began to proclaim that <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civilization.html" title="Civilization">civilization</a> — not just the state — would need to fall for anarchy to be achieved. A rejection of industrial <a href="../../../t/e/c/Technology.html" title="Technology">technology</a> is also prominent in the views of many <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_anarchism.html" title="Green anarchism">green anarchists</a>. This worldview was associated with the growth of the anti-roads movement in the UK, <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth_First%21_dc36.html" title="Earth First!">Earth First!</a> and the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth_Liberation_Front_25d0.html" title="Earth Liberation Front">Earth Liberation Front</a> in the US, and the actions of <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodore_Kaczynski_7c14.html" title="Theodore Kaczynski">Theodore Kaczynski</a> (aka the "Unabomber").</p>
<p>Through the <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a> anarchists were actively involved in the labour, animal-rights, radical ecological, feminist movements, and later in the fight against fascism. It should be noted that, in general, the anarchists participating in these movements opposed social hierarchy in general, and their activism came naturally out of this position. The influence of this on anarchist thought is apparent, as most of the traditional anarchist philosophies emphasize the economic implications of anarchism, or arrive at anarchism from economic arguments. Since the mid-<a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>, anarchists have been involved in student protest movements, <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peace_movements.html" title="Peace movements">peace movements</a>, squatter movements, and the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-globalization.html" title="Anti-globalization">anti-globalization</a> movement, among others.</p>

Bloc participants confront the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police.html" title="Police">police</a>, set up barricades, and sometimes engage in the destruction of corporate property.</p>
<p>Although black bloc anarchists are often the anarchists high-lighted by the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Media.html" title="Media">media</a> at large protests, large-scale protests are often constructed and organised through non-hierarchical structures. Affinity groupings, spokescouncils, and networking all have led to the success of various large-scale anti-war and anti-globalization mobilizations, most notably at the protests against the <a href="../../../w/t/o/WTO_Meeting_of_1999_b4c3.html" title="WTO Meeting of 1999">WTO Meeting of 1999</a> in <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seattle%2C_Washington_9194.html" title="Seattle, Washington">Seattle</a>. Anarchists have also been involved heavily with underground direct action movements such as the Animal Liberation Front, and the Earth Liberation Front, which are considered "<a href="../../../e/c/o/Eco-terrorist.html" title="Eco-terrorist">eco-terrorist</a>" by federal authorities and some liberal organizations. Anarchism (or at least non-hierarchical systems of organizing) is now largely seen to have about the same sway in modern revolutionary movements as Marxism had in the 1960's.</p>
<p>However, anarchism is not constrained to political protest. Many anarchists also work with others to build parallel structures and organizations, such as communes, <a href="../../../e/c/o/Eco-villages.html" title="Eco-villages">eco-villages</a>, infoshops and radical social centers, <a href="../../../f/o/o/Food_Not_Bombs_4647.html" title="Food Not Bombs">Food Not Bombs</a>, radical labor unions, new education methods, and do-it-yourself media in various forms. They also emphasise equality and "horizontal" organizing within the movement, using such tools as <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consensus.html" title="Consensus">consensus</a> decision-making. This is in line with how anarchists interpret the idea of "dual-power", creating the new anti-authoritarian society "in the shell of the old", hierarchical one.</p>
<p>Some have said that recent technological developments have made the anarchist cause both easier to advance and more conceivable to people. <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_key_cryptography.html" title="Public key cryptography">Public key cryptography</a> and the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a> have made anonymous digital currencies such as e-gold an alternative to statist <a href="../../../f/i/a/Fiat_money.html" title="Fiat money">fiat money</a>. Many people use <a href="../../../c/e/l/Cell_phone.html" title="Cell phone">cell phones</a> or the Internet to form loose communities that could be said to be organized along anarchist lines. Some of these communities have as their purpose the production of information in a non-commodified or <a href="../../../u/s/e/Use-value.html" title="Use-value">use-value</a> format, a goal made attainable by the availability of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_computing.html" title="Personal computing">personal computing</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desktop_publishing.html" title="Desktop publishing">desktop publishing</a>, and <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digital_media.html" title="Digital media">digital media</a>. These things have made it possible for individuals to <a href="../../../f/i/l/File_sharing.html" title="File sharing">share music files</a> over the Internet. There are also <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_source.html" title="Open source">open source</a> programming communities, who donate their time and offer their product for free. Examples include <a href="../../../u/s/e/Usenet.html" title="Usenet">Usenet</a>, the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_software_movement.html" title="Free software movement">free software movement</a> (including the <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_b7e8.html" title="GNU">GNU</a>/<a href="../../../l/i/n/Linux.html" title="Linux">Linux</a> community and the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiki.html" title="Wiki">wiki</a> paradigm), and <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indymedia.html" title="Indymedia">Indymedia</a>.</p>

<p>The two main categories of anarchism are <a href="../../../i/n/d/Individualist_anarchism.html" title="Individualist anarchism">individualist anarchism</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_anarchism.html" title="Social anarchism">social (or collectivist) anarchism</a>.

For example some scholars consider <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon_876a.html" title="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a>'s <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutualism_%28economic_theory%29.html" title="Mutualism (economic theory)">mutualism</a> as a form of individualist anarchism, but some consider it to be somewhere in between individualism and collectivism. However, there are forms of anarchism that are not disputed as falling within either individualist or social anarchism. For, example the anarchism of Benjamin Tucker is always considered an individualist form of anarchism and the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-communism.html" title="Anarcho-communism">anarcho-communism</a> of Peter Kropotkin is always considered a social form of anarchism.</p>

<p><a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Stirner_aa58.html" title="Max Stirner">Max Stirner</a> was the author of a form of individualist anarchism called "Egoism." Stirner's "name appears with familiar regularity in historically-orientated surveys of anarchist thought as one of the earliest and best-known exponents of <a href="../../../i/n/d/Individualist_anarchism.html" title="Individualist anarchism">individualist anarchism</a>."<sup id="_ref-SEP-Stirner_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SEP-Stirner" title="">[1]</a></sup> In 1844, Max Stirner's <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Ego_and_Its_Own_4904.html" title="The Ego and Its Own">The Ego and Its Own</a></i> (sometimes translated as "The Individual and His Property") was published, which is considered to be "a founding text in the tradition of individualist anarchism."<sup id="_ref-SEP-Stirner_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SEP-Stirner" title="">[1]</a></sup> Stirner believs that most commonly accepted social institutions - including the notion of State, property as a right, natural rights in general, and the very notion of society - were mere illusions or <i>ghosts</i> in the mind, saying of society that "the individuals are its reality." He advocated egoism and a form of amoralism, in which individuals would unite in 'associations of egoists' only when it was in their self interest to do so. For him, property simply comes about through might: "Whoever knows how to take, to defend, the thing, to him belongs property." And, "What I have in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am the proprietor of the thing."</p>

<p>The 19th century individualists in America believed that defense of liberty and property should be provided by the private sector, along with all other goods and services. They espoused a <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labor_theory_of_value.html" title="Labor theory of value">labor theory of value</a>, and, as a result, they regarded profit (and hence, capitalism insofar as it allows that) as being exploitative. They believed that if the state did not intervene that competition would increase to such a large degree that the ability to profit would be much reduced or eliminated. They did not advocate revolutionary action but waged a campaign of education in order to make change the individual first. <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victor_Yarros_4f89.html" title="Victor Yarros">Victor Yarros</a> said, "The abolition of the external State must be preceded by the decay of the notions which breathe life and vigour into that clumsy monster: in other words, it is only when the people learn to value liberty, and to understand the truths of the anarchistic philosophy, that the question of practically abolishing the State looms up and acquires significance." There was some disagreement over the issue of land ownership. Most of these individualists believed that an individual should no be considered to own land if he was not using it, but some such as <a href="../../../l/y/s/Lysander_Spooner_53a2.html" title="Lysander Spooner">Lysander Spooner</a> did not agree with that philosophy<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[2]</a></sup>. On the subject of employment, <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Tucker_454b.html" title="Benjamin Tucker">Benjamin Tucker</a> said he supported the freedom of individuals in "carrying on business for themselves or from assuming relations between themselves as employer and employee if they prefer."."<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[3]</a></sup> But, he thought that if the state did not prevent anyone to starting a bank that wished that an abundance of banks would spring forth which would be competing to lend money. This increased competition, he thought, would reduce interest rates to near zero. Tucker believed this would cause the number of businesses to rise since financing for new businesses would be nearly free. The rise in the number of business seeking employees relative to the number of individuals seeking employment would cause a rise in wages due to businesses competiting for employees. Tucker thought wages would rise to the level where there the employer would not be able to profit from the individual's labor. This is discussed in his most famous essay <i>State Socialism and Anarchism</i>.</p>
<p>Notable figures that assist in this period who subscribed to the labor theory of value include <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josiah_Warren_9645.html" title="Josiah Warren">Josiah Warren</a>, Benjamin Tucker, Lysander Spooner, and Ezra Heywood. This form of individualist anarchism has largely been replaced by the anarcho-capitalist version, however some individualist anarchists of this type do still exist such as <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Peacott_53d7.html" title="Joe Peacott">Joe Peacott</a> and <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Carson_3c69.html" title="Kevin Carson">Kevin Carson</a>. Many also consider Henry David Thoreau as an individualist anarchist due to his position that individuals should not be governed and his belief that all should be free to withdraw themselves from "any incorporated body," but he did not have an economic philosophy.</p>

<p>Another form of individualist anarchism appeared in systemized form in the mid 20th century. It is most often referred to an <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalism</a>. Like their 19th century predecessors, anarcho-capitalists believe that defense of liberty and property would best be performed by the private sector through providers competing for business. However, it discards the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labor_theory_of_value.html" title="Labor theory of value">labor theory of value</a> that was held by the 19th century individualist anarchists, and as a result it does not consider profit to be exploitative. Anarcho-capitalism exists in several forms, but its most popular form was developed by <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murray_Rothbard_a505.html" title="Murray Rothbard">Murray Rothbard</a>. Rothbard believed that the labor theory of value was flawed and said that Tucker, who he called a "money crank," had a flawed understanding of economics to think that deregulated banking would cause interest rates to be reduced to near zero. Not only did he think the economic theory was wrong but he asserted that profit was not exploitation. The belief that it was exploitation had been resting on an incorrect premise, he asserted. Rather than believing that there is a proper price of things that can be determined by the amount of labor entailed in producing those things, he asserted that value was totally subjective and that there was no proper price of anything other than the rate at which two individuals voluntarily decide to trade a good or service.</p>
<p>Much of the credit for the foundations of anarcho-capitalist theory goes to <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murray_Rothbard_a505.html" title="Murray Rothbard">Murray Rothbard</a> who formally synthesized 19th century individualist anarchism with with <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austrian_economics.html" title="Austrian economics">Austrian economics</a>.

<p>Anarcho-communism shares many things in common with anarcho-syndicalism but generally rejects private property in favor of collectivizing the means of production and products of labor. The Florence Conference of the Federation of the International, formulated by <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlo_Cafiero_e736.html" title="Carlo Cafiero">Carlo Cafiero</a>, <a href="../../../e/r/r/Errico_Malatesta_e495.html" title="Errico Malatesta">Errico Malatesta</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrea_Costa_76fb.html" title="Andrea Costa">Andrea Costa</a> and other ex-<a href="../../../g/i/u/Giuseppe_Mazzini_d774.html" title="Giuseppe Mazzini">Mazzinian</a> Republicans, in laying out the principles of anarcho-communism states: "<i>Italian Federation of the International considers the collective property of the products of labour as the necessary complement to the collectivist programme...</i>" Cafiero notes, in Anarchie et Communisme, that private property in the product of labor will lead to unequal accumulation of capital, and therefore undesirable class distinctions. Anarcho-communism developed as a rejection of the individualist anarchism of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proudhon.html" title="Proudhon">Proudhon</a>; <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Dejacque_144c.html" title="Joseph Dejacque">Joseph Dejacque</a> wrote to Proudhon criticizing him for his support of private ownership of the product of labor and a market economy: "it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature." Anarcho-communists advocate an egalitarian society without markets or wages, and instead, propose collectives based on direct worker control, <a href="../../../g/i/f/Gift_economy.html" title="Gift economy">gift economies</a>, self-management over community institutions, and mutual aid based upon the idea of "from each according to their ability, to each according to need." Anarcho-communists also propose large- and small-scale connections of communities, groups, and workplaces through <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federation.html" title="Federation">federations</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/t/Network.html" title="Network">networks</a> created by <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_association.html" title="Free association">free association</a> and popular affinity. Anarcho-communists want direct worker control over production, and have decisions made through <a href="../../../w/o/r/Workers_councils.html" title="Workers councils">workers councils</a> and assemblies. Communities would be organized through systems of direct democracy, and through various organizations and collectives to carry out various tasks.</p>

Historically, anarcho-communism is believed to have been put into practice by millions of people in the anarchist collectives and communes of the anarchist-controlled region of <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukraine.html" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a> during the Russian Revolution, and during the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Civil_War_7a30.html" title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a> in the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aragon.html" title="Aragon">Aragon</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catalonia.html" title="Catalonia">Catalonia</a> regions of Spain.</p>

The Platform calls for anarchist organisations based on "Theoretical Unity, Tactical Unity, Collective Action and Discipline, and Federalism", and has been accepted by some anarchists and scorned by others.</p>
<p>Anarcho-communists today are involved in various broad labor and community issues; generally revolving around housing, labor struggles/strikes, anti-racism, and building the anarchist movement. Anarcho-communists have generally called for more cohesive groups and structures of anarchist groups and thereby garnered criticism from other anarchist sects. Various large-scale groups of anarcho-communists exist today with the larger groups existing throughout various countries.</p>
<p>Traditional <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_individualist_anarchist.html" title="American individualist anarchist">American individualist anarchists</a>, have denied that anarcho-communism is a form of anarchism. <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Tucker_454b.html" title="Benjamin Tucker">Benjamin Tucker</a> has referred to it as "psuedo-anarchism." <a href="http://www.geocities.com/listen_liberty/shouldlaborbepaidornot.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/listen_liberty/shouldlaborbepaidornot.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>

<p>Anarcho-syndicalism is the anarchist wing of the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labor_union.html" title="Labor union">labor union</a> movement. Its primary aim is the end of the wage system and the abolition of private property, both of which are believed to lead to class divisions. It functions on principles of workers solidarity, <a href="../../../d/i/r/Direct_action.html" title="Direct action">direct action</a>, and self-management.</p>
<p>Workers solidarity is the belief that all workers -- no matter what <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race.html" title="Race">race</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gender.html" title="Gender">gender</a>, or <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_group.html" title="Ethnic group">ethnic group</a> -- are in a similar situation vis-à-vis their bosses. Furthermore, within capitalism, any gains or losses made by some workers in their relation to bosses will eventually impact all workers. Therefore, in order to gain liberation, all workers must support one another in their <a href="../../../c/l/a/Class_war.html" title="Class war">struggle against bosses</a>.</p>
<p>Anarcho-syndicalists only believe in direct action — that is, action directly designed to confront a problem. Direct action can range from traditional <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strike_action.html" title="Strike action">strike action</a> to active <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabotage.html" title="Sabotage">sabotage</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers' organizations — the organizations struggling against the wage system who, in anarcho-syndicalist theory, will eventually form the basis of a new society – should be self-managing. They should not have bosses or "business agents"; rather, the workers should be able to make decisions that affect them amongst themselves.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Workers_Association_e143.html" title="International Workers Association">International Workers Association</a> is an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labor unions from different countries. The <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_Workers_of_the_World_366b.html" title="Industrial Workers of the World">Industrial Workers of the World</a>, a once-powerful, still active, and again growing labor union, is considered a leading organ of the anarcho-syndicalist program in the United States. The Spanish <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederaci%C3%B3n_Nacional_del_Trabajo_b9fe.html" title="Confederación Nacional del Trabajo">Confederación Nacional del Trabajo</a> played a major role in the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Civil_War_7a30.html" title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a>, and today it is the third biggest union in Spain. Other major anarcho-syndicalist organizations include the <a href="../../../w/o/r/Workers_Solidarity_Alliance_f7a8.html" title="Workers Solidarity Alliance">Workers Solidarity Alliance</a>, and the <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solidarity_Federation_2593.html" title="Solidarity Federation">Solidarity Federation</a> in the UK.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-communist.html" title="Anarcho-communist">Anarcho-communist</a> critics of anarcho-syndicalism oppose the strategy of unions, believing them to feed into the concept of capitalism and because they are hierarchically organized. Also, some contend that its focus on proletarian <a href="../../../c/l/a/Class_struggle.html" title="Class struggle">class struggle</a> overlooks the needs of segments of society such as parents or others occupied with child-rearing or domestic labor, although some anarcho-syndicalist thought attempts to address other sectors of economic life. Post-left anarchist thinkers, notably <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Black_61d6.html" title="Bob Black">Bob Black</a>, contend that an anarcho-syndicalist revolution would leave in place social systems they find oppressive (<a href="../../../w/o/r/Work.html" title="Work">work</a> and workplaces, for example), although anarcho-syndicalists contend that worker self-management would render those systems fundamentally more humane. At issue also is the willingness of various anarcho-syndicalists groups to collaborate with government in their activities.</p>
<p>Some, generally primitivsts, hold that anarcho-syndicalism is not a form of anarchism and attack it as a purely workerist ideology. For example, Feral Faun argues in "The Bourgeois Roots of Anarcho-Syndicalism" that anarcho-syndicalism is actually a non-anarchist form of liberalism that, by default, supports capitalism. <a href="http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/syndicalism.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/syndicalism.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></p>

<p>Anarcho-primitivism is an anarchist critique of industrial <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civilization.html" title="Civilization">civilization</a>, and of the <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alienation.html" title="Alienation">alienation</a> that <a href="../../../t/e/c/Technology.html" title="Technology">technology</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progress.html" title="Progress">progress</a>, etc., have created between people and the natural world. Primitivists generally associate oppressive structures of hierarchy with the rise of agriculture, specialization of tasks or <a href="../../../d/i/v/Division_of_labor.html" title="Division of labor">division of labor</a>, the production of surplus and the first city-states. Anarcho-primitivists point to the anti-authoritarian nature of many 'primitive' or hunter-gatherer societies throughout the world's history, as examples of anarchist societies, but do not generally make them a "blueprint" for the future.</p>
<p>The primitivist tendency has connections to radical environmental movements such as <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth_First%21_dc36.html" title="Earth First!">Earth First!</a> and the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth_Liberation_Front_25d0.html" title="Earth Liberation Front">Earth Liberation Front</a>.

<p>Some assert that anarcho-primitivism is not a form of anarchism. For example, Brian Oliver Sheppard, in <i>Anarchism Vs.

In reality, the two have nothing to do with each other."</p>

Feminist anarchism, or anarcha-feminism (a term allegedly created during the 1960s' <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second-wave_feminism.html" title="Second-wave feminism">second-wave feminism</a>), views <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriarchy.html" title="Patriarchy">patriarchy</a> as the first manifestation of hierarchy in human history; thus, the first form of oppression occurred in the dominance of male over female. Anarcha-feminists then conclude that if feminists are against patriarchy, they must also be against all forms of <a href="../../../h/i/e/Hierarchy.html" title="Hierarchy">hierarchy</a>, and therefore must reject the authoritarian nature of the state and capitalism.</p>
<p>Anarcho-primitivists see the creation of gender roles and patriarchy a creation of the start of <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civilization.html" title="Civilization">civilization</a>, and therefore consider primitivism to also be an anarchist school of thought that addresses feminist concerns. <a href="../../../e/c/o/Eco-feminism.html" title="Eco-feminism">Eco-feminism</a> is often considered a feminist variant of green anarchist feminist thought.</p>
<p>Anarcha-feminism was inspired early 20th-century authors and theorists such as <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emma_Goldman_57e3.html" title="Emma Goldman">Emma Goldman</a> and <a href="../../../v/o/l/Voltairine_de_Cleyre_e47c.html" title="Voltairine de Cleyre">Voltairine de Cleyre</a>, although even early first-wave feminist <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Wollstonecraft_e830.html" title="Mary Wollstonecraft">Mary Wollstonecraft</a> held proto-anarchist views.

Here, <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolfi_Landstreicher_f22c.html" title="Wolfi Landstreicher">Wolfi Landstreicher</a> writes some of the basis points of its praxis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Insurrectionary anarchism is not an ideological solution to all social problems, a commodity on the capitalist market of ideologies and opinions, but an on-going praxis aimed at putting an end to the domination of the state and the continuance of capitalism, which requires analysis and discussion to advance. We don’t look to some ideal society or offer an image of utopia for public consumption. Throughout history, most anarchists, except those who believed that society would evolve to the point that it would leave the state behind, have been insurrectionary anarchists. Most simply, this means that the state will not merely wither away, thus anarchists must attack, for waiting is defeat; what is needed is open mutiny and the spreading of subversion among the exploited and excluded. Here we spell out some implications that we and some other insurrectionary anarchists draw from this general problem: if the state will not disappear on its own, how then do we end its existence? It is, therefore, primarily a practice, and focuses on the organization of attack...The State of capital will not “wither away,” attack is the refusal of mediation, pacification, sacrifice, accommodation, and compromise.

<p>The term <i>post-anarchism</i> was originated by Saul Newman in his book "From Bakunin to Lacan: Antiauthoritarianism and the Dislocation of Power" to refer to a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and <a href="../../../p/o/s/Poststructuralist.html" title="Poststructuralist">poststructuralist</a> thought. In this sense it has similarities with post-Marxism associated with <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernesto_Laclau_abf2.html" title="Ernesto Laclau">Ernesto Laclau</a> and Chantal Mouffee.

<p><i>Post-left anarchy</i> (anarchy often used instead of "anarchism" to avoid the connotations of doctrine that the <i>-ism</i> suffix brings) is a more recent current in anarchist thought that seeks to distance itself from the traditional "left" - communists, liberals, social democrats, etc. - and to escape the confines of <a href="../../../i/d/e/Ideology.html" title="Ideology">ideology</a> in general. It has rapidly developed since the fall of the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>, which many view as the death of authoritarian leftism; however, its roots are clearly visible in the ideas of the 1960s <a href="../../../s/i/t/Situationists.html" title="Situationists">Situationists</a>. It is not an independent "movement" as such but rather a critical way of thinking about anarchist ideas.</p>
<p>Post-leftists argue that anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment to contrary "leftist" movements and single issue causes (<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-war.html" title="Anti-war">anti-war</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-nuclear.html" title="Anti-nuclear">anti-nuclear</a>, etc.). It calls for a synthesis of anarchist thought and a specifically anti-authoritarian revolutionary movement outside of the leftist milieu. It often focuses on the individual rather than speaking in terms of class or other broad generalizations and shuns organizational tendencies in favor of the complete absence of hierarchy. Total individual liberation is a key focus, rather than merely economic liberation.</p>
<p>Important groups and individuals associated with Post-left anarchy include: <a href="../../../c/r/i/CrimethInc_6b2e.html" title="CrimethInc">CrimethInc</a>, the magazine <a href="../../../a/_/j/Anarchy%7E_A_Journal_of_Desire_Armed_62db.html" title="Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed">Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed</a> and its editor <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_McQuinn_6b23.html" title="Jason McQuinn">Jason McQuinn</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Black_61d6.html" title="Bob Black">Bob Black</a>, and others.

<p><b>Small 'a' anarchism</b></p>
<p>The term "small 'a' anarchism" has been used in two different, but not unconnected contexts.</p>
<p>Dave Neal posited the term in opposition to big 'A' Anarchism in the article <a href="http://www.spunk.org/library/intro/practice/sp001689.html" class="external text" title="http://www.spunk.org/library/intro/practice/sp001689.html" rel="nofollow">Anarchism: Ideology or Methodology?</a>. While big 'A' Anarchism referred to ideological Anarchists, small 'a' anarchism was applied to their methodological counterparts; those who viewed anarchism as "a way of acting, or a historical tendency against illegitimate authority." As an anti-ideological position, small 'a' anarchism shares some similarities with <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-left_anarchy.html" title="Post-left anarchy">post-left anarchy</a>, while Neal's insistence that it entails a rejection of the idea that there can be an "ultimate Truth" recalls the poststructuralist turns of post-anarchism (see above).</p>
<p>David Graeber and Andrej Grubacic offer an alternative use of the term, applying it to groups and movements organising according to or acting in a manner consistent with anarchist principles of decentralisation, voluntary association, mutual aid, the network model, and crucially, "the rejection of any idea that the end justifies the means, let alone that the business of a revolutionary is to seize state power and then begin imposing one's vision at the point of a gun." <a href="http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=41&amp;ItemID=4796" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=41&amp;ItemID=4796" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> Graeber and Grubacic do not offer a comprehensive list of groups within this rubric, but suggest that it includes the likes of autonomism, Zapatismo and radical democracy. It should be stressed that many of these groups do not describe themselves as "anarchist", perhaps deliberately, and are grouped instead on the basis of what they do, implying that the criteria for inclusion are similar to those articulated by Neal.</p>
<p>It is unclear how far the term has been picked up by the wider anarchist movement, but it does help to clarify and begin to explain some of the conflicts and disagreements within contemporary anarchism.</p>

</div>
<p>A <i>Utopian anarchist</i> believes, primarily, that nothing is static, everything is relative, and constantly affecting everything else. However, purpose is important, as is progress of purpose, and progress towards fulfillment of purpose. A Utopian anarchist is always thinking of the end desire, and makes decisions through life keeping this context in mind.</p>
<p>Much stress is put upon developing education and evolution. Through free association, a complex web of desires and goals will be strived for, each influencing and perhaps assisting one another in our paths.</p>
<p>The system strives for perfection, through unified diversity. Any static system will have flaws, and flaws fester. If one brushes one's teeth the same way every day, what happens to the missed spot?</p>
<p>Some critics perceive a lack of safety in the absence of enforced moral judgment. One Utopian anarchist response would be to consider this an issue with ego and desire for personal power and appreciation.</p>
<p><b>Spiritual Anarchism</b></p>
<p><i>Spiritual Anarchism</i>, or Divine Anarchy, was originally expressed by the political revolutionary, poet and yogi <a href="../../../s/r/i/Sri_Aurobindo_796e.html" title="Sri Aurobindo">Sri Aurobindo</a> during the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_World_War_31c9.html" title="First World War">First World War</a> in a series of articles published in the <i>Arya</i>, and later made available in two books, <i>The Human Cycle</i> and <i>The Ideal of Human Unity</i>. The exaggerations of both individualistic and communistic streams of anarchist thought are harmonized by going beyond the vital and intellectual foundations of most other schools of anarchism and rooting itself firmly in the spiritual realization and dynamic perfection of the individual and universal godhead in the race.</p>
<p>A spiritual anarchist holds that a perfect form of social organization can only be achieved by governing our individual and collective life by a higher light than the intellectual reason, a deeper law of solidarity and oneness than emotional or mental bonds of association.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is a spiritual, an inner freedom that can alone create a perfect human order. It is a spiritual, a greater than the rational enlightenment that can alone illumine the vital nature of man and impose harmony on its self-seekings, antagonisms and discords. A deeper brotherhood, a yet unfound law of love is the only sure foundation possible for a perfect social evolution, no other can replace it. But this brotherhood and love will not proceed by the vital instincts or the reason where they can be met, baffled or deflected by opposite reasonings and other discordant instincts. Nor will it found itself in the natural heart of man where there are plenty of other passions to combat it. It is in the soul that it must find its roots; the love which is founded upon a deeper truth of our being, the brotherhood or, let us say,—for this is another feeling than any vital or mental sense of brotherhood, a calmer more durable motive-force,—the spiritual comradeship which is the expression of an inner realisation of oneness. For so only can egoism disappear and the true individualism of the unique godhead in each man found itself on the true communism of the equal godhead in the race; for the Spirit, the inmost Self, the universal Godhead in every being is that whose very nature of diverse oneness it is to realise the perfection of its individual life and nature in the existence of all, in the universal life and nature. <i>—<a href="../../../s/r/i/Sri_Aurobindo_796e.html" title="Sri Aurobindo">Sri Aurobindo</a>, The Human Cycle</i></p>

<p>Many political philosophers justify support of the state as a means of regulating violence, so that the destruction caused by human conflict is minimized and fair relationships are established. Anarchists argue that pursuit of these ends does not justify the establishment of a state, and in fact many argue that the state is incompatible with those goals. Anarchists argue that the state helps to create a <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monopoly_on_the_legitimate_use_of_physical_force.html" title="Monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force">monopoly on violence</a>, and uses force and violence to expand and protect elite interests.

<p>The anarcho-communists and anarcho-syndicalists advocate the elimination of private property, while the individualist anarchists support it as being essential to liberty. Individualist anarchists support private ownership of the produce of labor, including any resulting means of production. Since unused land is not the produce of labor, most classical individualists anarchists, such as Benjamin Tucker, oppose its ownership, but also oppose collective ownership of land. Tucker believes the concept to be incoherent and incompatible with anarchism: "<i>That there is an entity known as the community which is the rightful owner of all land, Anarchists deny. I . . . maintain that the community is a non-entity, that it has no existence, and is simply a combination of individuals having no prerogatives beyond those of the individuals themselves.</i> As they reject the notion of the community owning all land collectively, they assert that no permission is needed from the community to put it to private use and no compensation is due to them. The results of cultivating land are considered to be private property as it is the result of labor.</p>

<p>Since any belief consistent with anti-statism is anarchist, there are vastly different and often opposing ideas about: what constitutes aggression, what is valid property, and what forms and conventions societies should adopt. As a result, there is difference of opinion <i>within</i> each school about how to react to, or interact with, those with opposing ideologies. E.g. How should an anarcho-socialist commune react to an anarcho-capitalist firm next door? (And vice-versa.)</p>
<p>The tolerant attitude is to live with it - let reality be the judge. One should not use force to promote your program. Those who take this <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panarchy.html" title="Panarchy">panarchist</a> approach to 'foreign policy' generally predict that, since their system is better, it will attract more people in the long run. <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Tucker_454b.html" title="Benjamin Tucker">Benjamin Tucker</a> is a good example of this tolerant approach.</p>
<p>The intolerant (evangelical or expansionist may be more descriptive) attitude considers the other system aggressive and/or authoritarian by its very nature. Thus it is permissible, perhaps even a moral imperative, to use force against the perceived criminals. This attitude occurs among anarcho-capitalists, particularly those who cannot conceive of an anti-statist form of socialism. Indeed, "socialism" in colloquial speech is generally understood as "statist socialism." This attitude also occurs among anarcho-socialists, particularly those who cannot conceive of an anti-statist form of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propertarianism.html" title="Propertarianism">propertarianism</a>. Indeed, conventional socialist theory deems capitalism as necessarily authoritarian and exploitative.</p>

<p>Anarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent, due mainly to a number of high-profile violent acts including <a href="../../../r/i/o/Riot.html" title="Riot">riots</a>, <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assassination.html" title="Assassination">assassinations</a>, and <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insurrection.html" title="Insurrection">insurrections</a> involving anarchists. The use of <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a> and <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assassination.html" title="Assassination">assassination</a>, however, is condemned by most anarchist ideology, though there remains no <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consensus.html" title="Consensus">consensus</a> on the legitimacy or utility of violence.</p>
<p>Some anarchists share Leo Tolstoy's <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_anarchism.html" title="Christian anarchism">Christian anarchist</a> belief in <a href="../../../n/o/n/Nonviolence.html" title="Nonviolence">nonviolence</a>. These <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-pacifists.html" title="Anarcho-pacifists">anarcho-pacifists</a> advocate <a href="../../../n/o/n/Nonviolent_resistance.html" title="Nonviolent resistance">nonviolent resistance</a> as the only method of achieving a truly anarchist revolution. They often see violence as the basis of government and coercion and argue that, as such, violence is illegitimate, no matter who is the target. Some of Proudhon's <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">French</a> followers even saw <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strike_action.html" title="Strike action">strike action</a> as coercive and refused to take part in such traditional socialist tactics.</p>

Malatesta took the view that it is "necessary to destroy with violence, since one cannot do otherwise, the violence which denies [the means of life and for development] to the workers" (<i><a href="../../../u/m/a/Umanit%C3%A0_Nova_3a6a.html" title="Umanità Nova">Umanità Nova</a></i>, number 125, September 6, 1921<a href="http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/anarchists/malatesta/rev_haste.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/anarchists/malatesta/rev_haste.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>).</p>
<p>Between 1894 and 1901, individual anarchists assassinated numerous heads of state. Such "<a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda_of_the_deed.html" title="Propaganda of the deed">propaganda of the deed</a>" was not popular among anarchists, and many in the movement condemned the tactic. For example, McKinley's assassin, <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leon_Czolgosz_612c.html" title="Leon Czolgosz">Leon Czolgosz</a>, claimed to be a disciple of <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emma_Goldman_57e3.html" title="Emma Goldman">Emma Goldman</a>, but she disavowed any association with him.</p>
<p>Depictions in the press and popular fiction helped create a lasting public impression that anarchists are violent terrorists. This perception was enhanced by events such as the <a href="../../../h/a/y/Haymarket_Riot_85b6.html" title="Haymarket Riot">Haymarket Riot</a>, where anarchists were blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago%2C_Illinois_2106.html" title="Chicago, Illinois">Chicago, Illinois</a>.</p>
<p>Some anarcho-socialists distinguish between "violence" and "property destruction": they claim that violence is when a person inflicts harm to another person, while property destruction or property damage is not violence, although it can have indirect harm such as financial harm.</p>
<p>Individualist anarchists expressly oppose the intiation of physical force, believing force should only be used in defense and that anarchism should be promoted through through reasoned philosophy.</p>

<p>Some anarchists consider <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacifism.html" title="Pacifism">Pacifism</a> (opposition to <a href="../../../w/a/r/War.html" title="War">war</a>) to be inherent in their philosophy.

<p>Anarchist literature often portrays war as an activity in which the state seeks to gain and consolidate power, both domestically and in foreign lands. Many anarchists subscribe to <a href="../../../r/a/n/Randolph_Bourne_829d.html" title="Randolph Bourne">Randolph Bourne</a>'s view that "war is the health of the state"<a href="http://struggle.ws/hist_texts/warhealthstate1918.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://struggle.ws/hist_texts/warhealthstate1918.html" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>.

<p>Just as they are critical and distrustful of most government endeavours, anarchists often view the stated reasons for war with a <a href="../../../c/y/n/Cynicism.html" title="Cynicism">cynical</a> eye. Since the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protests_against_the_Vietnam_War_82bc.html" title="Protests against the Vietnam War">protests against the Vietnam War</a> in <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a> and, most recently, the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protests_against_the_invasion_of_Iraq_37e7.html" title="Protests against the invasion of Iraq">protests against the invasion of Iraq</a>, much anarchist activity has been <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-war.html" title="Anti-war">anti-war</a> based.</p>
<p>Many anarchists in the current movement however, reject complete pacifism, (although groups like Earth First!, and <a href="../../../f/o/o/Food_Not_Bombs_4647.html" title="Food Not Bombs">Food Not Bombs</a> are based on principles of non-violence), and instead are in favor of self-defense, and sometimes violence against oppressive and authoritarian forces which they in fact also consider as defensive violence. Anarchists are skeptical however of winning a direct armed conflict with the state, and instead concern themselves mostly with organizing. Most anarchists however, do not consider the destruction of property to be violent, as do most activists who believe in non-violence.</p>

<p>One criticism of anarchism claims that the lack of a state (in particular, police and military forces) would leave the community defenseless against organised violence. Many anarchists believe in a distinction between interpersonal violence and state violence. They see interpersonal violence as a creation of class society and patriarchy, effectively producing people predisposed to violence. State violence is viewed by all anarchists as the result of power structures and the nature of the state. Briefly, anarchists believe that the establishment of anarchy will preclude most individual and social violence. Anarchists also point to examples of autonomous and anarchist societies in which the self-management of society has led to a reduction in crime; for example, Zapatista communities, the Spanish Revolution, and various IWW-led uprisings and strikes that have caused short-term near-anarchic situations.</p>
<p>Most anarchists perceive the need for some kind of organised communal self-defence, in the context of a world with continuing states and other repressive institutions. For many, this would take the form of an armed voluntary militia undifferentiated from the community at large, and organised on a fundamentally collective basis. Additionally, most anarchists perceive the need for social systems of mediation and arbitration to resolve disputes in a voluntary manner, replacing the judicial functions of courts. However, individualist anarchists tend to advocate "private police" and private courts to protect individual liberty and private property.</p>
<p>Critics, however, express doubts concerning the effectiveness of a voluntary militia against a ruthless modern military using <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weapons_of_mass_destruction.html" title="Weapons of mass destruction">weapons of mass destruction</a> and hierarchical structure. Critics also argue that historical examples, like the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Civil_War_7a30.html" title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a>, do not support the theory that anarchist communities can defend themselves. Some anarchists argue that examples like the Spanish Civil War actually support their contention that even communities who face vastly superior forces and are poorly supplied can hold out when they believe they are fighting for a just cause.</p>

<p>Some critics of Anarchism claim that modern economic production in a stateless society is impossible. This critique assumes that economic order can only result from State central planning or capitalist market forces. Social, democratic or other emergent structures of production are seen as impossible within this critique.</p>
<p>In a stateless society where one community has no formal relationship with another, as some anarchists envision, production would be localized, eliminating the benefits of <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economies_of_Scale_9934.html" title="Economies of Scale">Economies of Scale</a> and regional specialization. Some anarchists see a positive social value in communities producing the majority of their own needs, this would mean socially chosen losses in economic efficiency. Other anarchists oppose the transportation of goods for environmental reasons, the mass production of goods for cultural or environmental reasons, or industrial production for ethical and environmental reasons. However, many anarchists support the socialisation of industrial production, and see no contradiction between producing for economies of scale and community interests.</p>
<p>Though anarchists are against a centrally controlled or coordinated economic system, most do believe that some sort of system (or multiple co-existing systems) must replace the current, capitalist system, either with a <a href="../../../g/i/f/Gift_economy.html" title="Gift economy">gift economy</a>, a <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time-based_currency.html" title="Time-based currency">time-based currency</a>, or other, theoretical exchange/production paradigms. <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Black_61d6.html" title="Bob Black">Bob Black</a> proposed that anarchy would allow for "the abolition of work"<a href="http://www.zpub.com/notes/black-work.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.zpub.com/notes/black-work.html" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>.</p>
