	    <p>The anarchist ideology arrived in <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestine.html" title="Palestine">Palestine</a> at the beginning of the 20th century, carried by a big wave of emigrants from Eastern Europe (<a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/t/Lithuania.html" title="Lithuania">Lithuania</a>, <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukraine.html" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a>). The ideas of <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Kropotkin_48a3.html" title="Peter Kropotkin">Peter Kropotkin</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leo_Tolstoy_eb79.html" title="Leo Tolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</a> had remarkable influence on famous exponents of some Left <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionism.html" title="Zionism">Zionists</a>, such as Yitzhak Tabenkin, Berl Katzenelson, and Mark Yarblum. Ironically, the organizer of the Jewish self-defense movement, Joseph Trumpeldor, who has later became a hero of the Israeli Right, was very close to <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-syndicalism.html" title="Anarcho-syndicalism">anarcho-syndicalism</a> and even declared himself an anarcho-communist. Anarchism has also had some infuence on the constitution of socio-political movements such as Poalei Zion, Zeirei-Zion, He-Halutz, and Gdud ha-Avoda. The early <a href="../../../k/i/b/Kibbutz.html" title="Kibbutz">Kibbutz</a> movement was libertarian socialist in nature. At that time, many Left Zionists rejected the idea of establishing a Jewish nation-state and promoted Jewish-Arab solidarity <a href="http://www.chomsky.info/books/reader01.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.chomsky.info/books/reader01.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/19970609.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/19970609.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> .</p>
<p>The anarchists in Palestine at the beginning of the century, nearly all coming from Eastern Europe, did not have connections with the powerful Yiddish anarchist movement and had adopted the Hebrew language, which was unpopular among the European Jewish anarchists, many of whom opposed all forms of Zionism and supported the grassroots Yiddish culture of the <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashkenazic.html" title="Ashkenazic">Ashkenazic</a> Jewry. In the 20s and 30s all lived on the kibbutz: for example, the famous anarchist Aharon Shidlovsky was one of the founders of the kibbutz "Kvutzat Kinneret". During the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_revolution.html" title="Spanish revolution">Spanish revolution</a> many anarchists of Palestine rushed to <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a> in order to fight against Franco and fascism in the ranks of the libertarian CNT-FAI militia.</p>
<p>The Austrian-Jewish anti-authoritarian philosopher <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Buber_69dd.html" title="Martin Buber">Martin Buber</a> settled in Jerusalem in 1938. Buber considered himself a "cultural Zionist". He rejected the idea of Jewish nationalism and was a staunch supporter of a bi-national solution in Palestine.</p>
<p>While many <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_anarchism.html" title="Jewish anarchism">Jewish anarchists</a> were irreligious or sometimes vehemently anti-religious, there were also a few religious anarchists and pro-anarchist thinkers, who combined contemporary radical ideas with the traditional anarchistic trends in <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kabbalah.html" title="Kabbalah">Kabbalah</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasidism.html" title="Hasidism">Hasidism</a>. The <a href="../../../o/r/t/Orthodox_Judaism_0be8.html" title="Orthodox Judaism">Orthodox</a> <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kabbalist.html" title="Kabbalist">Kabbalist</a> rabbi <a href="../../../y/e/h/Yehuda_Ashlag_41d7.html" title="Yehuda Ashlag">Yehuda Ashlag</a>, who moved to Palestine in 1921, believed in voluntary communism, based on the principles of Kabbalah. Ashlag supported the <a href="../../../k/i/b/Kibbutz.html" title="Kibbutz">Kibbutz</a> movement and preached to establish a network of self-ruled internationalist communes, who would eventually <i>annul the brute-force regime completely, for “every man did that which was right in his own eyes.”</i>, because <i>there is nothing more humiliating and degrading for a person than being under the brute-force government</i> <a href="http://www.kabbalah.info/eng/content/view/full/3811" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.kabbalah.info/eng/content/view/full/3811" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. However, most of the contemporary followers of Ashlagian Kabbalah seem to ignore the radical teachings of their <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebbe.html" title="Rebbe">rebbe</a>.</p>
<p>Until the 40s, there were no anarchist organizations in Palestine. A little before and immediately after the constitution of the State of Israel, in 1948, there was an influx of western European anarchist survivors of Nazism, educated in Yiddish, and among them, anarchism had a specific and visible presence. Between the end of the 40s and the beginning of the 50s, Polish immigrants formed an anarchist group in Tel-Aviv whose main exponent was Eliezer Hirshauage, author of a book on the history of the Polish anarchist movement published in 1953. Beginning in the 50s, Israeli anarchism makes reference to Abba Gordin (1887-1964), writer and philosopher, one of the more remarkable representatives of the Yiddish anarchist movement. Gordin had been the inspirer of the pan-Russian anarchist movement and one of the organizers of the Anarchist Federation of Moscow (1918). From 1925, he lived in New York, where he had emigrated and where he published a literary philosophical review, "Yiddishe Shriften" (1936-1957), as well as being a habitual contributor to the most long-lived anarchist periodical in the Yiddish language, the Freie Arbeiter Stimme (1890-1977).</p>
<p>In 1958, Abba Gordin moved to Israel, and in Tel Aviv, founded a Yiddish anarchist circle, "Agudath Schochrei Chofesh" (ASHUACH), with a library of classic anarchist works in Yiddish, Hebrew, and Polish, and with a large hall for meetings and conferences. He also began to publish a bilingual monthly review (in Yiddish and Hebrew), "Problemen/Problemot," which he directed from 1959 to 1964. During this period, ASHUACH had approximately 150 members and drew hundred of people to conferences on the philosophy of anarchism. Among the more debated topics: the spiritual roots of anarchism and the connections between anarchism, the Book of the Prophets (Neviim), and the <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kabbalah.html" title="Kabbalah">Kabbalah</a>. "Problemen" published stories and articles on the history of anarchism, <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasidism.html" title="Hasidism">Hasidic</a> legends, medieval Jewish literature and the current problems of Yiddish literature.</p>
<p>After the death of Abba Gordin, from 1964 to 1971 the review was directed by Shmuel Abarbanel. In 1971, Joseph Luden (born in Warsaw, 1908) took his place and affiliated the review with a publishing house that published fifteen or so books and pamphlets of fiction and poetry, all in Yiddish. Therefore, since "Problemen" came to be solely in Yiddish, it lost the Hebrew half of its title. The number of pages went from 24 to 36.</p>
<p>ASHUACH and "Problemen" were in permanent contact with the Yiddish anarchist movement and in particular with "Freie Arbeiter Stimme" of New York and "Dos Freie Wort" of Buenos Aires. In the meantime "Problemen" was becoming less philosophical and more literary. The readers of the review belonged to every field of the Israeli society. The writer Leonid Podrydchik defined Problemen as the best Israeli publication in Yiddish language.</p>
<p>ASHUACH comes to a halt in the 80s. The old anarchists died one after the other and none of the young ones knew Yiddish. The last number of "Problemen" was published in December 1989 (it was the one-hundred-and-sixty-fifth issue). Subsequently Joseph Luden tried to share with one new review, "Freie Stimme", in order to continue the tradition of "Problemen", but only printed a single issue in September, 1991. This was the last Yiddish anarchist periodical publication in the world.</p>

<p>The contemporary anarchist movement in Israel is small, but very active. The anarchists actively participate in Palestinian solidarity, peace and environmentalist movements.
