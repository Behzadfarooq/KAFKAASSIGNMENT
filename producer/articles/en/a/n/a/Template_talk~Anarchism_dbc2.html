<dd>I see that both National and Nationalist anarchism have now been removed from the template. My view was that as long as two separate articles exist side-by-side, and Nationalist anarchism had been added to the template (not by me), then National-Anarchism was entitled to the same deal; the banner is on both pages after all. I realise there is a controversy over the anarchist status of the Nat-Ans, and frankly they're not my favourite people right now, but I don't know why people aren't entitled to the information that not only have there been nationalist currents of anarchism (and at Nationalist anarchism a few of us are trying to write a serious article on that, not merely a soapbox for the Nat-Ans) but also that National-Anarchism is rather divergent from even other nationalist anarchisms. Let's have the signposts up so folk can check them both out and make their own minds up.</dd>

<dd>Is it widespread on Wikipedia for people to speak in code and/or pronounce summary judgments on articles with barely any discussion? UF, I've no idea what IMO means in your template edit summary, but what really has me baffled is the comment that an article of this nature "doesn't even merit discussion". The subject-matter of the more general article - that nationalism permeates the sources of anarchism (Proudhon, Bakunin) and that nationalistic groups have arisen right out of the heart of the anarchist mainstream - certainly does merit discussion. I admit that it could do with comprehensive sourcing and I am working on that, but in the meantime some informative external links have been coming together, so there is clearly discussion going on out there.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I also fail to see how an article which deals with Proudhon's and Bakunin's nationalism, or Landauer's (he was the foremost German anarchist of his day), and offers scope for expansion in these areas, could be called "marginal". Come and work on the article but don't inhibit its growth by leaving it off the template, which is the most prominent evidence a lot of people will get that the subject exists. (I can add a 'See also' link on certain other anarchism pages but I don't think it would be as visible.)</dd>

<p>Opposition to nationalism is basic to anarchism. There can be different kinds of opposition, some more cosmopolitan, some more culturally-specific, so perhaps an issues-article might have some relevance. OTOH, Proudhon's anti-semitism, etc., like his sexism, etc. is generally considered a character flaw, not a theoretical contribution. Jacob Haller 01:49, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nationalism centers on national identity, the national will, and the nation-state as an expression of both. National identity is defined by birth (either descent-based or territorially-based) so it is not voluntary association. (Cultural identity is defined by language, practice, etc. in contrast to national identity). National will? I can't figure out what that could mean. The nation-state ends up doing meaningless things like 'defending national honor' and 'protecting national values' among its other depredations. (we have this taboo against marijuana in this country; therefore it will be legally banned...) Jacob Haller 02:06, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Aside from my POV that anarcho-capitalism is the true anarchism, I don't see anything as being "basic to anarchism," as far as allowing some type of self-styled "anarchism" into the article. Terrorism ("propaganda by the deed") is part of "anarchism," even. Theft is advocated by many anarchists. There is no single "anarchism." There is no idea that unites all the philosophies. There are just various philosophies and people claiming to be "anarchists" all conflicting with each other. So, I don't see how it's relevant whether nationalism is "voluntary" or not - as far as what is allowed to go in the article, that is.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 02:16, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, but most anarchists would disagree with you on both points. Personally, I'm conflicted on my beliefs regarding nationalism, which depends partially of course on how nationalism is defined. But based on some definitions of it, I tend to be more open to the idea than some other anarchists, which I think is largely due to my background in cultural anthropology. I'm still <i>very</i> wary of it though, and would <i>never</i> call myself a nationalist for a wide variety of reasons. Regardless, national and nationalist anarchism are not significant movements within anarchism, and I don't think they should be taking up space on the template, which I think should focus only on highly notable and significant trends in anarchism. We can link to it in the anarchism category and such, but they really shouldn't be on the template. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><b><font color="black">Ungovernable Force</font></b></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_Poll_dd8a.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force/Poll"><font color="green"><sup>Poll: Which religious text should I read?</sup></font></a> 04:16, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, there'd be no point in me restoring the template links if you guys are just going to remove them again. I'd hope to build up to something approaching consensus before proceeding and in this case it looks like a tall order. But for starters, I can't see that it matters how much support anarcho-nationalism has at the present time. That's an accident of history (I would guess largely down to the anti-nationalist reaction in the wake of the Nazi and Franco disasters). This interpretation of anarchy had a lot more support in the past (JH, it's not just about Proudhon; I've mentioned Bakunin and Landauer, and a case might be made for Kropotkin and Makhno) and that makes it <i>historically</i> important, if nothing else. Who is to say that it won't hold the field again? How will things fall out 100 years from now? Maybe today's mainstream will look like a temporary aberration conditioned by its time.</dd>

<dd>Proudhon's, and Bakunin's, anti-semitism is really a separate issue and has no necessary connection with their nationalism; maybe a future rewrite of Nationalist anarchism could address that point. Anyway, nobody could accuse Landauer of anti-semitism; he was a Jew who renounced Judaism, that's all. Still, on what criteria are we picking and choosing which bits of Proudhon's anarchism are 'the real thing' and which are character flaws? Isn't it retrospective, arguing that 'real' anarchism is where most anarchists are at now, and therefore early anarchists were 'not quite there' yet? This is an encyclopedia; it isn't for us to make those sorts of subjective value-judgments as to what <i>should</i> come under the 'anarchism' category. That decision can only be settled by some Olympian historian hovering at the end of time. What we do here is <i>record</i> that there's this school which identifies itself as anarchist. If there's a dispute about what anarchism means, we record that too. What we don't do is use classification as a subtle way of telling people what to think. If it isn't clear what's included, either we throw everything in and leave it for people to make their own minds up, or we might as well do away with the template and explain that 'anarchism' is too subjective to serve as a meaningful overarching category.</dd>

<dd>JH, a part of your argument (nation-states as an embodiment of national identity and 'national will') is in straw man territory, since anarcho-nationalists don't advocate the nation-state and don't hold that it is an inevitable extrapolation from nationhood. It's an argument that reminds me of the Jewish practice of 'building a fence around the Law', i.e. putting something innocuous out of bounds so that people don't get within spitting distance of the thing that's actually forbidden. Because statists and militarists have exploited the feeling of nationhood, that is supposed to damn nationalism itself. 19th-century nationalism (with important exceptions like Hegel) was founded upon the vision of the peaceful coexistence that would become possible between nations once each had control of its own affairs within its own space. That's why nationalists tended to look at nationhood as an intermediate stage in the direction of European union. It wasn't their doing that conservative elites regained the initiative late in the century, hijacked the national ideal and arrested the process halfway in order to maintain their local power bases.</dd>

<dd>I take your point that, even in the absence of a territory or a state, people are not voluntarily members of a descent-based ethnic group, but then we are not voluntarily born into anything. Our very existence is imposed upon us unbidden and we simply do the best we can with it. What is the alternative - the disruption and breakdown of all ethnic groups and cultures? In that case, how is your non-nationalist version of anarchism <i>not</i> going to end up as genocidal as the Nazis were in the name of nationalism? You might not necessarily be killing people, but you are killing inherited ways of living that have proved their survival value. Without those underpinnings we all fall into the abyss of an atomized global monoculture and then we might as well be dead anyway. <a href="../../../g/n/o/User%7EGnostrat_972c.html" title="User:Gnostrat">Gnostrat</a> 03:33, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure where to begin. Nationalism turns nationality into the key organizing principle of the whole society. So nationality could be harmless and nationalism still be harmful. Anarchism regards free (and equal) association as a key organizing principle of a healthy society. Now how can everything center around nationality and free association? They are two incompatible principles. Jacob Haller 06:47, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I debated some of these issues with a Greek nationalist elsewhere. I was somewhat sloppy with my word choices, but this should explain where I'm coming from even out of context: Jacob Haller 06:47, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some people, born into Greek families in Greek communities, will find that Greek culture doesn't mean much to them; other people, born in non-Greek families in non-Greek communities, will find Greek culture does mean a lot to them. I wouldn't want to seperate either from their families, but I would want both groups to find whichever community best fits them. I was born into one culture but have discovered another culture which echoes through my dreams. In anarchism, larger or smaller enclaves of Greek culture could emerge wherever Greek people have settled in numbers. In statism, surrounding states may want to coopt or destroy such enclaves. When they impose one national identity, one language, one religion, etc., they not only take away the different identities of the other groups, but they take away the old identity of the main group and twist it to become an instrument of domination. When several groups live as equals, each group can pass their traditions to their children and those who settle among them; when part of one group lives as rulers, and the other groups live as an underclass, the latter groups can only pass fragments of their traditions to their children, and fragments of their traditions to their rulers' children. Instead of each group learning what they can from the other groups, each group loses much if its own tradition and gets only random jumbles of other traditions.</p>

<dd>Of course, this being Wikipedia, the effects of nationalism are less important than the definition of it. But this should make clear: I do not intend to 'build a fence around the law.' Jacob Haller 06:59, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>It was perhaps a mischievous remark on my part. Your concept of an anarchist world, as you have clarified it, assigns a primary value to cultural survival and I accept that you are not envisaging assimilationism of ethno-cultural identities. Since you allow that 'nationality' might have some value, I do think we have common ground here. The internal contradictions in your treatment of nationalism bother me though, but at least part of the difference seems to be terminological. You're still arguing that anarchism necessarily rejects nationalism as such on the basis of attributing to it the flaws in <i>statist</i> nationalism. But what anarcho-nationalists mean by nationalism seems quite compatible with what you are saying about 'nationality'.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Monolithic statist nationalism has all the warping effects on traditions and culture which you describe, but that is not what anarcho-nationalists have advocated. Actually there are a number of anarcho-nationalist positions but usually it is put in terms of rejecting the identification of nation with the territory of a state, but still with allowance for some degree of separation if and where this is desired, which may take the form of a rigid communal separatism or alternatively, some more inclusive arrangement where a guest community maintains a special identity within a host community. Relations of oppression and dominance between groups (which may also simply be unintended consequences of relative numbers where a small group lives dispersed among a larger one) are exactly what a measure of territorial separation avoids. It is precisely a device for attaining equal relations between communities so that traditions can be passed on unadulterated, and has been the tried and tested solution throughout history and prehistory, regardless of whether we are talking about nation-states or hunter-gatherer bands. People who find themselves culturally beleagured can gravitate to where it is practical for a group of them to set up the structures to cater for that lifestyle.</dd>

<dd>Civil strife is all the more likely wherever two (or more) large cultural groups live together in a common territory under a common political system - even if it's the most direct form of democracy - so that the autonomous development of each is frustrated by the other community, with its different priorities, putting its oar into the shared decision-making processes. In such cases it's a fair assumption that territorial separation prevents conflict and may well prevent far more conflict than it ever generates between neighbouring groups; even more so if we throw in the anarcho-nationalist supposition that all this is worked out in the <i>absence</i> of a nation-state with its unstable political system to stoke up militarism.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>

<dd>The reason for still calling it nationalism is to signify a rejection of the kind of uniform mishmash in which peoples would not simply learn from each other's unique cultures, but would mutually absorb, amalgamate and hybridise each others' cultures until there will no longer be anything unique to learn from. It signifies the determination to preserve a special identity, and it makes no difference in practice whether that identity, and membership in it, has been inherited or chosen. Unity of biological descent has always had a large, but not exclusive, input into nations' self-image.</dd>

<dd>I think it is interesting that you still visualise 'enclaves' in an anarchist world. Enclaves are a version of territoriality. Far from a general indiscriminate mixing, you are envisaging free people freely choosing to discriminate as to where, and among whom, they live. Which is all that 'nationalism' essentially is: the birds-of-a-feather principle. I think you've thereby answered your own question about how nationality, based on birth, can be compatible with free choice. Some things are given by nature/heredity/genetics, whatever (and culture, by the way, can be no less compelling a factor than birth). We demonstrate our free agancy by what we choose to do with them.</dd>

<dd>I wouldn't agree that culture has <i>nothing</i> to do with nationality. They are conceptually distinct, but that doesn't mean thay are unrelated in practice. More or less, all national cultures start from within a fairly limited descent group; some remain identified with that group, and others grow by drawing in different people from the outside. I can't see the relevance in terms of practical consequences. Nor can I see how the idea of anarchy that you have described is anything other than anarcho-nationalism without the name. <a href="../../../g/n/o/User%7EGnostrat_972c.html" title="User:Gnostrat">Gnostrat</a> 15:54, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't mean to make a personal attack, Gnostrat, but considering that your page indicates some subscription to <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Identity_769f.html" title="Christian Identity">Christian Identity</a> philosophy on your part probaly inclines many people here to view your positions and edits with skepticism.

<dd>It shouldn't be an issue. You judge a case on its own merits, not on the basis of who the advocate is. I'll be dealing with the CI question at some length on my own talk page. Briefly: there are many versions of CI, some anti-semitic and others not, some prepared to work with Black nationalists and others dismissive, some into discussion circles and others into shooting the sheriff and expropriating banks. This isn't the place to go into all that, except to say that what inspired me at the time was the <i>positive</i> message of 'Aryan' cultural survival, which I came at from a 'left-wing' angle on a basis of no-double-standards. (There are Celtic, Australian aboriginal and Native American activists who would give all they've got for separate nationhood but let a white Anglo-Saxon take up the cry and straight away s/he is a 'fascist'! Do some people deserve a culture and others have to make do with the monoculture? If that's the message from anti-fascists, then they could be stoking up resentment which will sooner or later boil over into <i>real</i> fascism.)</dd>
<dd>For the record, it was the negative messages that had me backing off in the end. It's one thing to positively explore your heritage, and something else to sit through meetings of paranoiacs who only want to discuss Elders of Zion, financial conspiracies and Jews under every bed. <a href="../../../g/n/o/User%7EGnostrat_972c.html" title="User:Gnostrat">Gnostrat</a> 17:23, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A theod [or it's members, to be precise] may see themselves as a nation (defined by birth, either within territory x or from ancestors y) or as a culture (defined by shared practices, traditions, etc.). I think an anarchist theod-ism has to be cultural, not national, and in practical terms has to respect other cultures like its own. Jacob Haller 00:08, 15 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Respect for other cultures, yes: a million howling yesses! On terminology though, more people are familiar with the word 'nation' (which usefully preserves continuity with the historic locus of pro-'theodic'-diversity values in 19th-century nationalism), and they can grasp that since it <i>is</i> defined by birth, it <i>isn't</i> determined by statehood. 'Nationalism' is also preferable since '<a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodism.html" title="Theodism">theodism</a>' has the disadvantage of being already in use as a synonym for Germanic neo-paganism. Finally, if a pastoral 'theod' out on the savanna wishes to define itself exclusively by descent, no anarchy worth its name could (or should) deny it that prerogative. That's about respect too. <a href="../../../g/n/o/User%7EGnostrat_972c.html" title="User:Gnostrat">Gnostrat</a> 17:59, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have removed <b>Black anarchism</b> from the template in light of the arguments above. I have also removed the "debate" which has been mislocated onthe <a href="../../../a/n/a/Talk%7EAnarchism_e72f.html" title="Talk:Anarchism">talk:Anarchism</a> page. My view is that both <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalist_anarchism.html" title="Nationalist anarchism">Nationalist anarchism</a> and <b>Black anarchism</b> should be on the template as they relate to general phenomena, but not <a href="../../../n/a/t/National-Anarchism_d830.html" title="National-Anarchism">National-Anarchismwhich</a> relates to a specifc organisation. I find a lot of the debate on this topic besides the point, as the issue is not whether editors agree with this or that poltical viewpoint, but whether a phenomenon exists. When people remove material without even adding a comment on the relevant talk page and then declare that the topic does not merit discussion, this goes against the very guidelines of wikipedia. As much as I deplore <a href="../../../g/n/o/User%7EGnostrat_972c.html" title="User:Gnostrat">Gnostrat</a>'s viewpoint, I do notsee that talk pages are s utable place to take them to task.This can be done on is talk page if necessary. "Opposition to nationalism is basic to anarchism" has little basis in reality, as evinced by the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalist_anarchism.html" title="Nationalist anarchism">Nationalist anarchism</a>, whether or not a significant number of anarchists think so. The fact that some people wish to erase any reference to the phenomenon of people combining anarchism with nationalism should be an issue of concern to anyone who wants to have a template that accords with wikipedia standards. Aside from all the chit-chat about what people consider what the society envisaged by anarchists should be like, only <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Owen</a> has made a relevant comment:</p>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalist_anarchism.html" title="Nationalist anarchism">Nationalist anarchism</a> is too marginal for inclusion.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Perhaps people could focus on this issue. Bearing in mind the phenomenon encompasses such seminal figures as <a href="../../../b/a/k/Bakunin.html" title="Bakunin">Bakunin</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proudhon.html" title="Proudhon">Proudhon</a>, and <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landauer.html" title="Landauer">Landauer</a>, I think the phenomenonclearly is notable, and Jacob Haller's suggestion that such aspects of the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Founding_father.html" title="Founding father">founding fathers</a> of anarchism that he fins unpalatable are "character flaws" is simply POV. I feel that the page could be improved so that it is useful particularly for those people who would navigate wikipedia in search of a better understanding of the social movements that have shaped modern society rather than simply being misled by those who would rather they were not exposed to certain political phenomena which do not fir with pre-determined dogma.<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarrypotter_9204.html" title="User:Harrypotter">Harrypotter</a> 20:04, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree that Talk:Anarchism was not the place for this debate. I believe I did attempt to address the issue of marginality in my posts above, but it hasn't really been picked up. I have also argued that all ideologies which exist and define themselves as forms of anarchism should indeed be included on the template regardless of whether or not others would see them in that light. The point of the above discussion is to lead towards a consensus for reinstating <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalist_anarchism.html" title="Nationalist anarchism">Nationalist anarchism</a> on the template (I concede your point about <a href="../../../n/a/t/National-Anarchism_d830.html" title="National-Anarchism">National-Anarchism</a> as something more specific) and it would be useful if it wasn't left to turn into a dialogue between Jacob Haller and myself.</dd>

<p>Hello. The Anarchism image on the politics portal was changed to a black flag to more broadly encompass the topic. It would make sense to do the same with this template. Votes can be placed below. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcMyWords_6cbb.html" title="User:MarcMyWords">Marc Mywords</a> 22:31, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I swapped in the black flag image on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Anarchism&amp;oldid=110741687" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Anarchism&amp;oldid=110741687" rel="nofollow">this revision</a> and then reverted myself so that everyone can see one edit with the black flag logo in place. I did a straight swap of one for the other, but the flag did not show up for me. I don't know if it's just my computer or what have you, but if someone can make it work, then great. But I'd like to see it in place on a revision before I pass judgment. I see nothing particularly wrong with the A sign, but I'd like to see the flag before I decide for sure. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchuminweb_da4b.html" title="User:Schuminweb">SchuminWeb</a> (<a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchuminweb_e3cb.html" title="User talk:Schuminweb">Talk</a>) 03:26, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I an't see the flag image there. But, I don't see why it would be preferable to the circle-A. The circle-A is instantly recognisable, a more basic image, and less ambiguous (consider that non-anarchist groups have used black flags). ~<span style="font: small-caps 14px times;"><b><a href="../../../s/w/i/User%7ESwitChar_b02e.html" title="User:SwitChar"><font color="#FF0000">Swi</font><font color="#000000">tch</font></a></b> <sup><a href="../../../s/w/i/User_talk%7ESwitChar_3e09.html" title="User talk:SwitChar"><font color="#005500">t</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SwitChar_62fc.html" title="Special:Contributions/SwitChar"><font color="#005500">c</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/i/User%7ESwitChar_Gallery_ccb3.html" title="User:SwitChar/Gallery"><font color="#005500">g</font></a></sup></span> 03:37, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
