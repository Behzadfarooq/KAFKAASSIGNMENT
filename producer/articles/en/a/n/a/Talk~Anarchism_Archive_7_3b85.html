<p>I have been researching the subject, and have finialy realized what the common thread betwixt anarchism, socialism, and communism is... theoretical (I'd say its always theoretical of course, but then I'm not a commie&#160;;) egalitarianism. How to create egalitarianism w/o a state is in all likelyhood something unlikely to be explained anytime very soon, but I for one would not so modestly suggest <a href="../../../s/y/n/Syndicalism.html" title="Syndicalism">Syndicalism</a> as a good foundation on which to rest any workable theory. It is not only capable of integrating w <b>real</b> (as opposed to the type of stuff discussed around the <a href="../../../h/o/o/Hookah.html" title="Hookah">hookah</a>&#160;;) society and economics, but has also had more success than any other form of anarchism, best as I can tell. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam</a> <a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESam_Spade_3418.html" title="User talk:Sam Spade"><b>Spade</b></a> 05:29, 20 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The egalitarianism bit doesn't seem very appropriate to me, either. Anarchy is not fundamentally about egalitarianism, although some may like it for some such motivation, and some adherents may seek it. But liberty (as conceived) would appear to be primary. -- <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily">V</a></dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Equality of what? Equality is very important in anarchist thought, and in many ways is considered synonymous with liberty. I don't think that equality of wealth is important to most, but economic equality is important to many, in the sense that no person is the boss of another. Legal equality is important to all, as an anarchist society cannot grant one person greater legal rights than another; being "the President" or a "police officer" in an anarchist society does not confer rights that others lack (such as the right to have particular weapons, the right to demand tribute, or the right to enter another person's residence without permission)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, I think that the reference to egalitarianism is redundant, as the abolition of hierarchy implies the establishment of egalitarianism. I'm not sure which term is the better one tho: "hierarchy" is parallel to "anarchy", but "egalitarian" probably means more to most readers than "hierarchy" does. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamRetchless_d1d6.html" title="User:AdamRetchless">AdamRetchless</a> 01:55, 3 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK... the more I learn about anarchism, the less sense it makes&#160;;). So me having the biggest stick and the most stuff is ok then, by anarchist standards? Whats to stop people who have more (stuff, ability, courage, violent tendancies, organizational skills, etc...) from quickly taking charge, as has always happened after the temporary anarchies thruout history? The stuff I have been reading suggests imaginary anarchy is synonymous w theoretical communism. If so egalitarianism is key. If no, is <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warlordism.html" title="Warlordism">warlordism</a> an acceptable variation of anarchy?&#160;;) <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam</a> <a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESam_Spade_3418.html" title="User talk:Sam Spade"><b>Spade</b></a> 23:29, 2 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, this is naturally one of the most recurring counters to anarchism, that it is unstable. Various anarchists have answers, IMHO generally lacking, but of course we are here to report not to record our own conclusions. The dreamed-for anarchy would probably have more economic equality (since rich people would be annihilated), but that is not <i>per se</i> the goal, which is freedom. More to the point, anarchists are likely to have varying opinions on the connection between liberty and equality, so I don't think the intro should report outright that the latter is the intent. -- <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily">V</a> 23:38, 2 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>One of the defenses of anarchism (Typically coming from people who reject the utilitarian/consequentialist model of ethics) is that its instability/collapse is not a meaningful flaw of anarchism - that anarchism is an ethical necessity. One could argue, similarly, that the fundamental problem with peace is that someone eventually starts a war, as has happened after all the temporary peaces throughout history. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 05:10, 3 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>clearly both the questionable viability, and the extreme diversity of proposed methods (or lack thereof) of equality needs signifigantly more focus in the body of the article. Also <i><b>rich people would be annihilated</b></i>??? Whats that about? Do you have any documentation that this is intrinsic to anarchist thought? I want to be rich, and I <b>don't</b> want to annihilated, so maybe I should become an <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antidisestablishmentarianist.html" title="Antidisestablishmentarianist">antidisestablishmentarianist</a> instead?&#160;;) <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam</a> <a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESam_Spade_3418.html" title="User talk:Sam Spade"><b>Spade</b></a> 23:44, 2 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oops... I didn't mean to be anon when I deleted that statement, so you may blame me! <i>So me having the biggest stick and the most stuff is ok then...</i> That depends on the anarchist. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">VV</a> from what I can tell comes from the anarcho-capitalist side. But I agree to an extent with VV. This article is about anarchism in general, which by some definitions includes anarcho-capitalism, so it shouldn't be excluded. Anarcho-capitalism is <b>very</b> different from libertarian socialism (just look at the talk pages of those two philosophies, their adhearents diagree with each other more than they disagree with other political philosophies). I think your statement about egalitarianism was directed at the libertarian socialists, but I also think it was inappropriate. What do you mean by egalitarianism? The word is contentious, and many times used as a slurr against socialists of any flavor. I heavly disagree with the wiki article that you had linked to above. Wikipedia is not the place for original research, and this article, as discussed in the past is about what anarchists believe. Egalitarianism is not a word commonly used by anarchists (even the socialist libertarian types) to describe themselves, so it has no place in the introduction of the article. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillerc_2ebe.html" title="User:Millerc">millerc</a> 01:45, 3 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How anarchists describe themselves is of only modest import in the article, as this is ment to be informative, rather than propaganda, since it is an encyclopedia. That being said, <font>I now understand why that sentence isn't appropriate for the introduction, and I'll remove it if somebody else doesn't.</font> I don't know what you’re referring to about links, so I would ask you to be a bit clear in that regard. Perhaps we can all work together to give a better description of how egalitarianism is contrasted with warlordism, and outright mayhem in <b>applied</b> anarchism (this theoretical stuff is making my head swim, I think I'd prefer to focus on some reality&#160;;) <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam</a> <a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESam_Spade_3418.html" title="User talk:Sam Spade"><b>Spade</b></a> 04:10, 3 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that how anarchists describe themselves is of central importance here. Of central concern to being NPOV is presenting other views. If anarchists do not describe themselves as egalitarian, then the sentence should note that. When applying political adjectives to a group, it's pretty tough to be absolutely correct. (For instance, many would apply the adjective "fascist" to the current US government, although they do not identify themselves as such.) It's probably best, in these cases, to at least initially present the argument from the anarchist side, and then to introduce opposing view - it both makes it more intelligible, and allows the anarchist argument to appear in its best possible light. Which is part of the duty of NPOV (See <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_Point_of_View_9960.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral Point of View">Wikipedia:Neutral Point of View</a>, specifically the "Writing for the enemy" concept). That is, the anarchist argument should be presented discretely and well - as should the counter arguments. If anarchists do not believe themselves to be egalitarian, the claim ought not be ascribed to them absolutely. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 05:10, 3 May 2004 (UTC)

<dd>You can present other views all you want, but it is important to describe them as such. The line that Sam Spade added made it sound like it was something that an anarchist herself would say, and my point is that it wasn't. It's also not good to present all others' views in the introduction (it would be quite a large introductory paragraph). There are litterally too many political views to represent them all on every wiki page of a political nature — and it would just be a poor article style. If the article is about anarchism let it be about what anarchists believe. This doesn't mean that it is propaganda! If we make it clear that the veiw points given are those of anarchists, then it has a NPOV. If someone else's view point is pertinent to a specific section of the article then it may be cited in that section. The whole egalitarian bit is something which Sam Spade seems to give himself credit for, and wikipedia has a no original research rule. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillerc_2ebe.html" title="User:Millerc">millerc</a> 20:50, 3 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If so, perhaps you could tell me if there is enough agreement amongst anarchists to allow much of any opinions <i>from</i> anarchists in the body of the article (as references), and whether perhaps it might do best to generally focus on the opinions of outsiders looking in. While this would open up an entirely other form of bias, it might well allow us at minimum a bit of consistancy of definition, and perhaps some objectivity as well. I am <b>very</b> concerned about getting bogged down in rhetoric and deceit and the other ugly trappings of politics in this article. I'd like to focus on what anarchists are, and what most people think of them, as well as what they might call themselves, or claim. I am still concerned that for many, it is simply a prettier name for "communism", and has little to do with <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchy.html" title="Anarchy">anarchy</a> itself. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam</a> <a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESam_Spade_3418.html" title="User talk:Sam Spade"><b>Spade</b></a> 04:19, 3 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The term anarchism has been laid claim to by so many different groups that this becomes a tough question. There isn't a consistancy of definition, and that's one of the central problems of writing an encyclopedia article on the subject. I mean, I can tell you right off the bat that the article doesn't pay nearly enough attention to anarcho-capitalsim and "right wing" anarchism. I think the article would benefit most substantially from clear and separate sections on types of anarchism, honestly. Unfortunately, I'm not quite qualified to do an overview - though I can do a great section on anarcho-capitalism.&#160;:) <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 05:15, 3 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In the Communist Manifesto, it is claimed that the state would wither away in a communist society.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">anarchy</span></h2>
<p>'(quoted from <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchy.html" title="Anarchy">anarchy</a>) we find the common application of the term to states of political disorder.

There are a few others (<a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albania.html" title="Albania">Albania</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burundi.html" title="Burundi">Burundi</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina_c758.html" title="Bosnia and Herzegovina">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>, <a href="../../../r/w/a/Rwanda.html" title="Rwanda">Rwanda</a>) in which government is described as "emerging" or "transitional", and which were in anomie in the near past. The <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solomon_Islands_abc3.html" title="Solomon Islands">Solomon Islands</a> is described as <i>tending towards</i> anomie because "violence, corruption and crime have undermined stability and civil society".

<p>I doubt many among us would argue for a political situation such as this, anarchist or no. What then is anarchism, and how would it (or has it, or does it) function?

<dd>There are a lot of views on this. I think many argue that government is simply illegitimate and should be torn down, regardless of the consequences. Others have specific proposals for alternative forms of social organization, the sort absent in Somalia, which nevertheless would not be called government. These are discussed somewhat well in the article, no?

<dd>There are a couple of views on this. First, there's the view that it can't practically be worse than what we have now. Second, there's the point that the CIA World Factbook is using anarchy in a differents ense than most people who are arguing for anarchy would use it - no anarchist that I know of advocates a warlord system. (And most would argue that this is not, functionally speaking, an anarchy.) Third, there's the argument that ethics and value are not based on consequences - this type of thought tends to reference Kant, the Categorical Imperative, and the notion that sometimes the right thing to do has a very harsh and negative cost. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 05:18, 3 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I tried to work in a deontological approach with a paragraph about how a person can arrive at anarchism from the principle of non-violence. However, that's a very limited example. The heading of this article describes anarchism as a political philosophy, but it could also be seen as an attitude or moral code (with political consequences). In that sense, anarchism could be the lack of belief in the legitimacy of any authority, similar to how an athiest doesn't believe in god. It could also be stated as the attitude that a person must always judge the morality of his own actions and cannot abdicate that responsibility to someone else (freethinker). Finally, it could be the belief that the morality of an act is not affected by any claim of authority. However, I think that these attitudes need to be extrapolated to political conclusions before they are full-fledged anarchism. Is this what you were getting at with comments about deontology? <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamRetchless_d1d6.html" title="User:AdamRetchless">AdamRetchless</a> 03:32, 12 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that the common definition of "anarchy" is sloppy and near worthless. Also, if this article is about the political philosophy of anarchism, then the common definition should basically be ignored. I view situations like Somolia as being a form of war, and I don't think there is much use in calling them anything but "war". They may be a form of war that does not tend towards any stable resolution, but in the end it is based upon multiple hierarchies attempting to crush each other and impose themselves on the people. I don't know how political scientists describe this situation, but I wouldn't use the CIA's terminology by default because they clearly have a political agenda. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamRetchless_d1d6.html" title="User:AdamRetchless">AdamRetchless</a> 13:34, 3 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I just read up on the history of Somalia, and I think this illustrates how worthless it is to say that Somalia is "in anarchy". The articles that I read described the situation in the 1990s by three terms: civil war, clan violence, intertribal conflict. Part of "Somalia" seceded in 1991 and has been stable since then, even if the UN doesn't recognize it. Other sections seceded in the late 1990s and apparently have been stable. It seems that when the CIA says that Somalia is in anarchy, they are describing its diplomatic condition rather than any real condition of the society itself. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamRetchless_d1d6.html" title="User:AdamRetchless">AdamRetchless</a> 14:28, 3 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would say the opposite, that the most simple and yet accurate definition is anarchy=war. The only way things could be otherwise is if people stopped possessing traits inherent in humanity, such as greed, aggression, lust for power, etc... Ignoring that obvious fact for the sake of anarchist theory would do a disservice to the reader. Perhaps it is as snowspinner says, a form of ethics where consequences are to be ignored, and where the current state is seen as a worse case scenario. If that is so, that should be articulated at length within the article, and the obvious outcome must likewise be made clear. The obvious outcome is that when you remove the laws and hierarchies that restrict us currently, MANY people (myself included) are going to use every means necessary to seize power and resources. and we are already preparing for this WTSHTF contingency. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam</a> <a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESam_Spade_3418.html" title="User talk:Sam Spade"><b>Spade</b></a> 20:04, 3 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think there are two definitions of anarchy in play here. The first is a lack of recognized government - this is the definition of anarchy employed by the UN and the CIA World Factbook. However, all of these situations have functional governments - a warlord system of despots. This is not anarchy in the sense of political theory, then, and it is not what any anarchist strives for. The second sense of anarchy is more elusive and debated - much like the concept of an "anarchist." Broadly, though, it refers to an idealistic state - one in which there is no controlling authority - internationally recognized or otherwise. That this state does not exist and has never existed is largely immaterial - after all, a communist state as spelled out by Marx has never existed either, nor have a number of other types of states that people advocate. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 20:10, 3 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are a number of persons (i.e. anarchists) who do not believe that "anarchy = war", so it clearly is not an obvious conclusion. In fact, many anarchists would make the claim that "anarchy is peace". As for the "lust for power", we can't ignore the present incarnation of this drive just for the sake of statist theory. Some anarchists believe that human flaws are largly the result of the current system, but I think that most anarchists recognize that these are things that would need to be dealt with in anarchist societies and they propose ways of dealing with them. This could be included as a section of the article...

<dd>Well, I think that it would be fairly silly to believe that anarchy&#160;!= war, or at least that war&#160;!= anarchy, since it's a definition in common use, and denying common usages of words is fairly silly. Better, I think, to note that this isn't what we mean when we say anarchy. In any case, I think here we run once again into the basic problem here - anarchism as a whole is about as well organized as one would expect. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 20:39, 3 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would say that of the two definitions of anarchy, one (that used by the CIA factbook) is the one most often used, and is seen by many as the likely end result of anarchist sucesses. The other, idealistic concept seems to me as pretty identical to communism, and I have heard a number of anarchists likewise suggest that this is the case. This would sem to show that my theory is corect, that a number of "anarchists" and anarchist philosophers might more accurately be labled as revoloutionary communists. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam</a> <a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESam_Spade_3418.html" title="User talk:Sam Spade"><b>Spade</b></a> 22:14, 3 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes. A number may well be labelable as such. The number, however, is not all. Conservative anarchists/anarcho-capitalists, for instance, are pretty far from communist.</dd>
<dd>As for the CIA definition, while it may be more often used, it's not the term used in political philosophy, which is the area in which anarchism exists. Words have different meanings in different contexts. In this context, anarchy is decidedly not a warlord system, as is clear from the fact that no anarchist would ever say that's what they support. Some anarchists might say they support communism in its idealized form. Many, however, would not. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 22:21, 3 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">presenting political ideologies</span></h2>
<p>As i said before, i think it would be good for this article to focus on anarchism as a political philosophy, clearly indicating that it is presenting anarchist POV. We have also discussed anarchy as a diplomatic status, or as a breakdown of civil society, but I don't think that those are appropriate topics for an encyclopedia article. To make it clear that we are presenting anarchism as a political philosophy, we could make one of those topic footers (see the bottom of <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biochemistry.html" title="Biochemistry">biochemistry</a>) for political ideologies. I've seen instructions for making these, but I forget how to do it right now. If you guys think that it would be helpful, I'll figure out how to make one. -adam</p>
