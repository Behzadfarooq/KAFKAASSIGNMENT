<dd>I'm not sure that's an inherantly accurate comparison. Both genitals are intended as sexual areas and have muscles which stop the flow of urine. Being a liquid, it's also a lot easier to clean and doesn't 'stick around' like the contents of the topic in question. Which, in accessing the anus, is releasing the muscles we have which stops access to the lower intestines. Perhaps a distinction could be made for your cause in 'rimming' the outside, and the insertion of the tongue which is distinctly more related to corprophagia. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETyciol_011d.html" title="User:Tyciol">Tyciol</a> 19:34, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yeah, it's happening post-move. It's non-encyclopaedic in the same way as "vaginal-oral contact" vs cunnilingus. <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> 21:35, Nov 19, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To be fair, the old ass to mouth article is still there, it hasn't been "moved" so much as duplicated. It's not the same as vaginal-oral contact vs. cunnilingus because cunnilingus is the only kind of vaginal-oral contact being discussed, they are equivalent terms. Here, anal-oral contact is a superset of both anilingus ans ass to mouth. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDante_Alighieri_2b5c.html" title="User:Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDante_Alighieri_3f7c.html" title="User talk:Dante Alighieri">Talk</a> 22:14, Nov 19, 2004 (UTC)

<p>Quite frankly, I'm suspicious of the whole "ass to mouth" concept. I don't know if it deserves its own mention at all.

<dd>That is a different argument than "anal-oral contact is a non-encyclopedic title". I'm not taking a stance on the appropriateness of the content at this point, just on its organization as long as its here. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDante_Alighieri_2b5c.html" title="User:Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDante_Alighieri_3f7c.html" title="User talk:Dante Alighieri">Talk</a> 00:44, Nov 20, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Different, but related. Anal-oral contact could mean just about anything, plus since there is a technical term available, that's what we should be using. If "ass to mouth" is the only reason why we're using "Anal-oral contact" instead of "Anilingus" I think it's a poor reason. I could as easily claim that "Fellatio" should be moved to "Genital-oral contact" because some people like to lick their partners' balls. <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> 18:52, Nov 20, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Actually "anus" in Latin does signify the ass-hole. "Nates" is the term for buttocks, but it is almost exclusively used in the plural, since people have, almost exclusively, two buttocks.</p>
<p>Actually (yet again) anus is a third declension feminine, not a second declension masculine. The stem form is therefore 'anu'. not ani. The word should be anulingus. So there. Quod est demonstrandum. Sic transit gloria anu. Et caetera.</p>

<dd>I personally see it as neutral, because it documents a historical condemnation rather than promoting a contemporary one. I don't think it denegrates the sexual act any more than it promotes the idea that the Knights Templar engaged in it. -Unknown

<p>This quote seems somewhat POV to me:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"After all, anilingus occurs most commonly in pornographic videos in which men are depicted as dominating and degrading women for the erotic pleasure of the audience. Many men and women find these practices offensive, while others find them extremely erotic."</dd>
</dl>
<p>In point of fact, most hetero pornographic videos show MEN performing analingus on WOMEN (and only rarely the reverse), which would seem to "degrade" the men, not the women, if one considers it degrading in the first place. Doubtless, many people find this offensive, but the act is generally performed in private because it is pleasurable-- its assimilation into pornography is an extension of its eroticism, not its degradation.</p>
<p>After all, we're not talking about coprophagy (feces-eating) here, which is a truly degrading act; simply the stimulation of a sensitive area, and arguably less repulsive even than anal sex, since there is no entry into the rectum.</p>
<p>In addition, the next paragraph cites "ingestion" by a known porn actress, implying that we are talking of coprophagy here. Perhaps the writer has confused this act, or lumped it into too general a category?</p>
<p>Basically, I request that the above quote be rewritten. In time, I may write it myself.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree. The part about "<b>Prevalence in pornographic videos</b>" sounds very academic but far from the truth though this might be hard to prove. It is definitely more men performing anilingus on women than the other way around in porn movies. Women on women is quite common as well. This applies to your average porn movie that aims at people that get excited form 'conventional' sex acts, which accounts for the larger part of porn. I also have my doubts about the following sentence:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>"In order to continue to be shocking, such videos sometimes rely on more obscure sexual acts, that many would consider degrading, in order to elicit a strong reaction from their audience. After all, anilingus occurs most commonly in pornographic videos in which men are depicted as dominating and degrading women for the erotic pleasure of the audience. Many men and women find these practices offensive, while others find them extremely erotic."</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In my opinion, the writer of this (probably a woman, but not that it should matter) has a wrong idea about why people watch porn in the first place. I'd say that the majority of people watch porn because it excites them and gives them sexual pleasure (while often combined with masturbation). It is part of their sex life, and normally they would watch things that they would want to do (or to be done to) themselves. The percentage of porn that people see in order to get shocked is minimal i would say, although it obviously exists.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I would also like to know what the assumption that most people see anilingus as being degrading to one of the partners is based on. Consider: a woman performs anilingus on a man in a movie. The female onlooker might see a woman being degraded or degrading herself. A male one may see a woman enjoying herself giving pleasure to a man. Most porn is watched by men i would say. Without some sort of proof this seems to be POV.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I would also say that most people don't watch porn to see women get degraded in the first place. As i mentioned, watching porn is part of (a lot of) people's sex life. Most of these people have 'normal' tastes. Women (not men) are the biggest stars in porn who enjoy huge fan bases of adoring people. Do these fans want to see their idols getting degraded or enjoying the sex they perform? Any statement on this should be provided with some sort of proof. Undeniably, there are people who like to watch porn where women are being degraded by men. But are there more than people who like to watch porn in which it is the other way around? This might be true, but where is the proof. Anyway, anilingus peformed by women on men is quite rare in porn so it is only a marginal subject in my opinion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Anilingus became something of a fad around 2003 or 2004 in American pornographic videos. Various explanations have been given for this trend, but one reason predominates: anilingus generally occurs in videos, targeted to both heterosexual and homosexual men, in which men dominate women, at least to a certain extent."</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I never heard of this 'fad' and i would like to see references to it and the 'various explanations' for it. Without sources i'd say the whole section should be deleted. --<a href="../../../v/u/n/User%7EVunzmstr_2b0b.html" title="User:Vunzmstr">Vunzmstr</a> 21:18, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was reading an article <a href="http://www.avert.org/orlsx.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.avert.org/orlsx.htm" rel="nofollow">Avert</a> about how easily HIV is transmitted via oral sex (the conclusion been "not very").

<p>The search term "Hot Carl" redirects to this subject. A Hot Carl does not involve anal-oral contact and should be its own article. -Unknown</p>
<p>I noticed someone reverted back the discussion about Hot Carl vs. Hot Karl, but it was quickly replaced. I wanted to specify my objections to it being redirected to Anal-Oral contact:</p>
<ol>
<li>A Hot Carl does not involve anal-oral contact, only fecal-oral contact, and can be done with or without a barrier.</li>
<li>I do not believe this qualifies as sexual slang. There is no proper term for this in sexual descriptions. A blowjob is slang for fellatio, but there is nothing describing Hot Carl.</li>
<li>I also point out that a Hot Carl is not Coprophagia, because ingestion of fecal matter is optional. Also, a Hot Carl is sexual in nature, Coprophagia is not.</li>

<dd>Well, I'm more than willing to show that "anilingus" is more cited and/or preferred to "anal-oral contact": 1. Anilingus has an entry in the Merriam-Webster <a href="http://m-w.com/dictionary/anilingus" class="external text" title="http://m-w.com/dictionary/anilingus" rel="nofollow">dictionary</a>, whereas anal-oral contact <a href="http://m-w.com/dictionary/anal%20oral%20contact" class="external text" title="http://m-w.com/dictionary/anal%20oral%20contact" rel="nofollow">does not</a> appear; and 2. All but 1 Wikipedias in other languages (except Catalan, which calls it "A2M", probably should go to the English <a href="../../../a/2/m/A2M_171e.html" title="A2M">A2M</a>) use "anilingus" as the title for the relevant Wikipedia articles.

<dd>The term 'oral-anal sex' is not in common use. A Google search suggests that anilingus/analingus are both in much more common usage. The main article name should reflect the most recognized term. (The term 'rimming' is probably the most recognized colloquial term, but its exact interpretation varies as to whether or not it is penetrative.) As per Wikipedia naming policy, the most common name should be used for the article, with redirects as appropriate. This should either be 'anilingus' (or possibly 'rimming', subject to discussion).--<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffro77_a4f8.html" title="User:Jeffro77">Jeffro77</a> 11:05, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would not have a problem renaming this article "rimming", since people actually use that word to describe the practice. However, between "oral-anal sex/contact" and "anilingus", I am against renaming it to the latter. I have presented (admittedly limited) evidence above that "anilingus" is rather less used than the alternatives when you consider sources with some credibility rather than a blanket Google search. I also don't like it because I feel that it is a rather silly word, constructed by analogy with cunnilingus,<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/anilingus" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/anilingus" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> probably in an attempt to sound pompous. (Actually, I think that "cunnilingus" was probably also constructed for the same reason. I don't like it either, but it has been in the language some 60 years longer than "anilingus"<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/anilingus" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/anilingus" rel="nofollow">[2]</a><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=cunnilingus" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=cunnilingus" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and is much more clearly well accepted.) It is not a word that can be used easily in ordinary conversation. "Remember last night when you were rimming me" is something people actually might say. "Remember last night when you and I were practicing anilingus" is not. The same is true of "anal-oral contact", but at least it is descriptive and doesn't sound so contrived.</dd>

<dd>You thinking it is a 'silly word' is hardly a valid reason not to use it, as it is indeed the correct word, and it is derived from Latin directly, not simply as an anology to 'cunnilingus' (as correctly indicated by the second dictionary quoted by the dictionary.com page you cited). I agree with your own implied condemnation of the current title (ergo "Remember last night when we were having oral-anal contact"). Though I can't imagine many people saying "Remember last night when were practicing cunnilingus" either. 'Rimming' does not technically refer to penetrative anilingus, and is therefore really a subset of anilingus. Anilingus should be the article title, rimming is a close second (and is what most people would look up if there were going to). If you think 'anilingus' sounds too 'pompous', or not used in conversation, then the headings for 'cunnilingus' and 'fellatio' will have to renamed as well.--<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffro77_a4f8.html" title="User:Jeffro77">Jeffro77</a> 22:38, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I already addressed some of your counterpoints in my previous comment. "Cunnilingus" has been in the language for longer and is more widely accepted and is therefore a more valid word that "anilingus". Being derived from Latin does not make something an accepted or "correct" term. (If that were true, then any word that isn't from Latin would be incorrect, which would leave English without much of its most important vocabulary.)
<dl>
<dd>It is interesting/amusing that you regard 'cunnilingus' as "a more valid word" than 'anilingus' on the basis that it has been around for longer. The (unrelated) word 'quasar' has been around for less than 50 years, and isn't in general conversational use. By your reasoning, that would make it a <i>less valid</i> word than 'anilingus'.--<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffro77_a4f8.html" title="User:Jeffro77">Jeffro77</a> 08:20, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The flawed logic in your comment on Latin derivation was amusing. Basically you said, 'If A is true because of condition B, then all things that do not meet condition B are false.' But I digress. My previous comments on the Latin derivation of 'anilingus' were not to justify its existence as a word, but merely to indicate that it is not simply back-formed from the word 'cunnilingus'.--<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffro77_a4f8.html" title="User:Jeffro77">Jeffro77</a> 08:26, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that naming the article "rimming" is a good solution. I'm not sure that there is any agreement among English speakers that this word does not refer to penetrative anal-oral contact ("rimming" does not "technically" refer to anything at all, since it is not a technical word; its meaning is determined only by how people use it), and, as you say, that is where people will look. If you don't agree, I think we should get a third opinion before doing anything. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrait_f702.html" title="User:Strait">Strait</a> 05:14, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hmmm, I'll take your word for it regarding dictionary.com although it would be helpful if you'd give the URL to save us all searching for it.

<p>Is it me, or are movies featuring this more than they used to? It seems like I can't watch a porn (it doesn't matter what kind) and they throw this analingus stuff in. It's not my cup of tea, and I think it ruins the movie every time. Maybe it's just me, but it seems like all kinds of fringe fetish stuff (e.g., spitting, anal followed by fellatio, etc.) is getting put into supposedly bread-and-butter porns these days.--Abs Like Jesus 15:36, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In line with <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autofellatio.html" title="Autofellatio">autofellatio</a> and autocunnilingus, while I don't think the idea is popular enough to warrant its own article, and obviously more difficult than either of the two previously mentioned feats, the latter of which is still awaiting proof of completion. Even so, perhaps it would warrant a mention in the article? In a metaphorical sense, such as <a href="../../../k/u/n/Kundalini.html" title="Kundalini">kundalini</a> imagery, the anus holds as much significance to the root chakra as the sexual organs do, and is much closer to the tailbone (bottom/base of spine). It is also more related to the food cycle than the sexual organs which merely release urine to regulate the blood through the kidneys. Also, perhaps tubgirl deserves mention, lol. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETyciol_011d.html" title="User:Tyciol">Tyciol</a> 19:38, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
