<dd>Laissez-faire capitalism is arguably the most important aspect of anarcho-capitalism (hence the existence of the term <i>capitalism</i> in the name), so why is there no mention of laissez-faire capitalism in this defining sentence? Why do I have to wait until the middle of the paragraph to see a mention of capitalism? Moreover, I would like someone to tell me the specific source(s) from which this definition is dervied (in particular, the clause about "initiatory coercion and fraud"); otherwise, there is no way for me to verify it and I will have no other choice but to consider it original research. -- <a href="../../../w/g/e/User%7EWGee_01b0.html" title="User:WGee">WGee</a> 02:13, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Anarcho-capitalists define capitalism as voluntary exchange...a free market. Some people define capitalism in other ways. I agree it needs a more definitional type intro sentence. Here is one from a source: "Anarcho-capitalism is a form of anarchism whose prime tenet is that the free market, unhampered by government intervention, can coordinate all the functions of society currently carried out by the state, including systems of justice and national defense. Anarcho-capitalists believe that a system of private property based on individual rights is the only moral system - a system that implies a free market, or total voluntarism, in all transactions. (Brown, Susan Love, The Free Market as Salvation from Government: The Anarcho-Capitalist View, Meanings of the Market: The Free Market in Western Culture, edited by James G. Carrier, Berg/Oxford, 1997, p. 99. (Article is a criticism of anarcho-capitalism. Brown is not an anarcho-capitalist.)) <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheIndividualist_25e6.html" title="User:TheIndividualist">TheIndividualist</a> 02:19, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Introductory paragraph</span></h2>
<p>I read the introductory paragraph three times, and I am still rather confused at the exact definition of anarcho-capitalism. There needs to be a solid definition, not the bs™ that's there now - <i>"Anarcho-capitalism is an individualist philosophy based on the idea of individual sovereignty, and a prohibition against initiatory coercion and fraud."</i> - well it's interesting it's based on that, but what is it? <i>"Its proponents see the only just basis for law as arising from the right to non-coercively acquired private property and an unlimited right of contract between individuals."</i> - That doesn't help define anarcho-capitalism either, and some individuals may encounter difficulty even comprehending that sentence at all. In fact, this entire article should be cut down and simplified a bit, and could someone insert a solid definition into the first 2 sentences? +<a href="../../../h/e/x/User%7EHexagon1_7aa4.html" title="User:Hexagon1">Hexagon1</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../h/e/x/User_talk%7EHexagon1_8a7c.html" title="User talk:Hexagon1">t</a>)</sup> 05:42, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ok, I put a first sentence definition in there. "Anarcho-capitalism is a form of individualist anarchism that proposes that all goods and services, including defense of liberty and property, should be supplied in a free market rather than by the state." <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheIndividualist_25e6.html" title="User:TheIndividualist">TheIndividualist</a> 06:00, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, looking like if you call Anarcho-capitalism a form of anarchism, you get folks coming out of the woodwork.

<dd>The sentence that is there now sounds about right - <i>Anarcho-capitalism is an individualist political philosophy that calls for the abolition of the state and the coordinatation of all functions of society, including justice and national defence, by the free market.</i>.

<p>While I can certainly see a case made for either, isn't two sidebars a bit much? Unless we can move one of them down so they both occupy the same space on the right, it really clutters up the article layout. Personally I'd say Anarcho-capitalism has more in common with the articles in the Anarchism series (particularly <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-syndicalism.html" title="Anarcho-syndicalism">Anarcho-syndicalism</a>) than with articles in the Libertarianism series.--<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosicrucian_a63e.html" title="User:Rosicrucian">Rosicrucian</a> 14:48, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree that two sidebars is too much, but I haven't removed either for the very reason you listed. They could at least be put one after the other rather than side-by-side.

<dd>Layout looks much improved as a result. I suppose we could have some contention over which one to put first, but I do hope we can all agree that the new layout makes the overall article more readable.--<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosicrucian_a63e.html" title="User:Rosicrucian">Rosicrucian</a> 16:12, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It certainly does, and I dearly hope we don't start arguing about which comes first. That would be quite silly. =) --AaronS 16:37, 29 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Of course, the research is proving bewildering. Every time I delve further and come closer to saying "okay, this is closer to anarchism" or "okay, this is closer to libertarianism" I find another passage that swings me the other way. Certainly Rothbard believed this to be an anarchist philosophy, but so many of the ideals involved are libertarian in nature, and it certainly doesn't clear things up to find that the man also practically codified what we now identify as libertarianism in the modern sense. Until I can wrap my head around this better any edits and suggestions I make will be procedural and layout oriented rather than content-oriented.--<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosicrucian_a63e.html" title="User:Rosicrucian">Rosicrucian</a> 21:23, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That makes sense. One of the difficulties with these articles is that it does require a lot of background knowledge. I admit that my own understanding of all of the different anarchist philosophies is elementary at best. --AaronS 21:33, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I added the tags, due to <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheIndividualist_25e6.html" title="User:TheIndividualist">TheIndividualist</a>'s most recent edit. That anarcho-capitalism is a form of <a href="../../../i/n/d/Individualist_anarchism.html" title="Individualist anarchism">individualist anarchism</a> is a highly contentious claim that does not belong in the article lead. It's also an example of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, becuase it's introducing a new synthesis of ideas into Wikipedia.

Please stop reverting. Thanks. --AaronS 16:41, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Saying "some regard as a form of individualist anarchism" is not "weasel words" if they are sourced, which they are. It is a true and indisputable statement that anarcho-capitalism is "considered by some to be a form of individualist anarchism." Your complaint is off the chain. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheIndividualist_25e6.html" title="User:TheIndividualist">TheIndividualist</a> 16:45, 29 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Off the chain? I'm not quite sure what that means. Read the guidelines on weasel words. Sources can be found to justify just about anything (especially primary sources). A while back, on <a href="../../../a/n/a/Talk%7EAnarchism_e72f.html" title="Talk:Anarchism">Talk:Anarchism</a>, I showed how one could make <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Marx_3bcc.html" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a> look like an anarchist simply by selectively citing the <i>Communist Manifesto</i>. Whether or not <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalism</a> is a form of <a href="../../../i/n/d/Individualist_anarchism.html" title="Individualist anarchism">individualist anarchism</a> is already discussed in <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_and_anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism">anarchism and anarcho-capitalism</a>. That's where the discussion belongs. It certainly does not belong in the lead of the article. --AaronS 20:24, 29 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Aaron is saying that those statements don't belong in the intro, i agree. they certianly should be included elsewhere, however. <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlockader_5d3e.html" title="User:Blockader">Blockader</a> 19:22, 29 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>And certainly they are included elsewhere in the article, complete with citation. Given that it is under dispute, it certainly shouldn't be in the first sentence as that will only give casual readers the wrong impression. The link between anarcho-capitalism and individualism is not core to the definition of the term, and thus should be left for later in the article where the nuances of it can be properly explained.--<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosicrucian_a63e.html" title="User:Rosicrucian">Rosicrucian</a> 21:37, 29 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Exactly. The core to the definition of the term is that it is an <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-statist.html" title="Anti-statist">anti-statist</a> <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_market.html" title="Free market">free market</a> <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a>. Why not use that as the lead, instead? Anarcho-capitalism might trumpet individualism, but that doesn't make it <a href="../../../i/n/d/Individualist_anarchism.html" title="Individualist anarchism">individualist anarchism</a>, because individualist anarchism is its own philosophy with its own history and its own sphere of influence, and so on. "Individualist anarchism" isn't just an adjective-noun grouping -- it's a complete term, denoting a philosophy. --AaronS 21:43, 29 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You are wrong. Individualist anarchism is a broad school of anarchism. All individualist forms of anarchism are individualist anarchism. Common sense. Individualist anarchism is not a defined philosophy other than being an individualist form of anarchism. Every individualist anarchist has his own idiosyncratic philosophy. And there is not just one source but many sources. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheIndividualist_25e6.html" title="User:TheIndividualist">TheIndividualist</a> 23:55, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Rothbard, who coined the term "<a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalism</a>," said that he wasn't an individualist anarchist. Anarcho-capitalism may be individualistic, and it might possibly be anarchism, but it is not <a href="../../../i/n/d/Individualist_anarchism.html" title="Individualist anarchism">individualist anarchism</a>. --AaronS 01:16, 30 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You're missing the point. What the others are saying is that it doesn't belong in the lead sentence, firstly because it is a highly contentious statement that makes use of weasel words to create the illusion of neutrality, and secondly because it is not the defining tenet of anarcho-capitalism. Keep the defining sentence simple and concise, then explain these complex nuances later, and in much more detail. To say that it is an "individualist philosophy" is sufficient enough for the lead sentence. However, are there any non-partisan, reputable sources to attest to the assertion that anarcho-capitalism is a "philosophy"? If multiple sources are not provided, we should change "philosophy" to "ideology".</dd>
<dd>Moreover, your edits did make use of weasel words, which Wikipedia editors <a href="../../../a/w/w/WP%7EAWW_3219.html" title="WP:AWW">should avoid</a>. You cannot say the article "<a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_is_a_featured_article__91fe.html" title="Wikipedia:What is a featured article?">exemplifies our very best work</a>" while it violates Wikipedia guidelines in the first sentence.</dd>

See the [<a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarco-capitalismo" class="external text" title="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarco-capitalismo" rel="nofollow">Spanish article</a>], for instance. The <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-capitalisme" class="external text" title="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-capitalisme" rel="nofollow">French Wikipedia</a> places it in its series on libertarianism. Its lead is: <i>L'anarcho-capitalisme est une théorie de la liberté. Combinaison du libéralisme et de l'individualisme, c'est une philosophie du droit basée sur le principe de non-agression.</i> Rough translation: <i>Anarcho-capitalism is a theory of liberty. A combination of libertarianism and individualism, it is a right-wing philosophy based upon the non-aggression principle.</i> There seems to be quite a disparity, here. --AaronS 02:07, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Indeed there is a disparity. If people wish to assert as fact that anarcho-capitalism is a strand of anarchism, they must support that assertion with several reputable, authoritative sources. Saying that anarcho-capitalism is a school of <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a> is to say that <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarian_socialism.html" title="Libertarian socialism">libertarian socialism</a> is a genre of <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarianism.html" title="Libertarianism">libertarianism</a>, an assertion that virtually all political scientists rebuff. The two ideologies may share their desire for utter liberty, but they fundamentally disagree about what "liberty" should entail, or how to achieve this ideal. Ignore the semantics of the term for a moment and ask yourself: Does anarcho-capitalism share more in common with the pro-capitalist, state-weary ideologies of libertarianism or with the anti-capitalist ideologies of anarchism? The answer, I think, is clear. The fervently capitalist ideals of anarcho-capitalism simply aren't compatible with the vehemently anti-capitalist ideologies that comprise anarchism. -- <a href="../../../w/g/e/User%7EWGee_01b0.html" title="User:WGee">WGee</a> 02:20, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm still mulling it over myself. The originator calls it anarchism, and it calls for the abolition of the state which <b>is</b> a common thread throughout anarchistic philosophies. Its notions on government as a coercive control shew very closely to other anarchy movements.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However economically it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck and the originator is one of the core theorists behind what modern political scientists recognize as libertarianism. He also does very little to distinguish it from his theories and musing on libertarianism, and many of the American Libertarian Party claim to be anarcho-capitalists.</dd>

<dd>Well, the ideology of "anarcho-capitalism" is a relatively new one. Although it derives ideas from ideologies that have existed for centuries, it is fundamentally new in its organization of these ideas. Usually it is the independent political science community who, some time later, classifies an ideology; but here it is the anarcho-capitalists who are classifying their own ideology right now. The question in my mind is: how can and why would the creators of anarcho-capitalism justifiably place it in a category comprised of ardently anti-capitalist ideologies? Anarcho-capitalism is <i>despised</i> by the anarchists and anti-capitalist anarchism by anarcho-capitalists, so it does not make sense to try to unite the two under the same category. The only connection between them is their support for the abolition of the state.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But does anarcho-capitalism's contempt for the state make it an anarchist ideology? I don't think so. Anarchism, in its <i>general semantical meaning</i>, is the belief that all forms of rulership are undesirable and should be abolished. However, in its <i>historical and political</i> meaning (which is what we should be discussing), anarchism not only supports the abolition of the state, but full social, economic, and political equality, as well. The first self-declared anarchist, <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon_876a.html" title="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a>, abhorred capitalism as a source of hierarchy and oppression, and that tradition continued in the dominate anarchist writers who superceded him, including <a href="../../../k/r/o/Kropotkin.html" title="Kropotkin">Kropotkin</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/k/Bakunin.html" title="Bakunin">Bakunin</a>. That political tradition does not change merely because of some 20th-century anarcho-capitalists who wish to become members of the anarchist clan.</dd>

<dd>You're wrong that all anarchism is about equality. Individualist anarchists do not aim for equality other than equal rights. Equal wealth is out of the question. Only anarcho-communists want equal wealth distribution. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheIndividualist_25e6.html" title="User:TheIndividualist">TheIndividualist</a>
<dl>
<dd>You seem to be ignoring my main points, though— one of which is that, throughout history, the dominate contributors to anarchism and the overwhelming majority of anarchists were anti-capitalist, even the individualist ones (though not necessarily anti-market or communistic). In fact, no capitalist strand of "anarchism" has ever existed, except since the 20th century in the form of questionably-named anarcho-capitalism. It does not make sense to dump anarcho-capitalism into a sea of vehemently anti-capitalist ideologies; the historical precedent doesn't allow it. -- <a href="../../../w/g/e/User%7EWGee_01b0.html" title="User:WGee">WGee</a> 04:24, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The historical precedent has already been made. Anarcho-capitalism has been around for quite a long time now...since the 1960's I think. The anti-capitalist individualist anarchists (meaning anti-profit) were around first then the communism anarchism showed up. The anti-individualist anarchists denied that it was a form of anarchism because the communists wanted to abolish private property, money, and markets. Then in the 1960's another new form of anarchism showed up...anarcho-capitalism and of course there's going to be anarchists denying it is "true anarchism." The anarcho-capitalists are also individualist anarchists but they don't think profit is exploitative. There's simply smarter individualist anarchists than the anti-capitalist individualist anarchists because of advances in economics. No serious economist today considers the labor theory of value as valid. Because one painting takes more labor to create than another, you're exploiting one of the painters unless you pay them equal price for their paintings. Come on. Just because you don't oppose profit it doesn't mean you're not an anarchist. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheIndividualist_25e6.html" title="User:TheIndividualist">TheIndividualist</a> 04:38, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>A historical precedent from the 1960's can't really be compared to the historical precendent set by Proudhon in 1840. But lets not incite political debate and begin to denounce or exhalt ideologies; that's just counterproductive and detracts from the improvement of the article. Central to this whole thread is that the assertion that anarcho-capitalism is a form of anarchism is disputed (evidenced by the foreign language Wikipedias), and that any sources asserting such a fact should be presented with this circumstance in mind. Another central principle, true of any article, is that hefty assertions require hefty sources; I don't believe your sources are "hefty" or reputable enough to merit inclusion in the lead. Let's use them elsewhere, where the controversy can be discussed in detail. Do you agree? -- <a href="../../../w/g/e/User%7EWGee_01b0.html" title="User:WGee">WGee</a> 05:32, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It doesn't matter what the foreign language Wikipedias say if they're not sourced. As you know anyone can write anything they want in Wikipedia unless someone is making sure everything is sourced. And no I do not agree that my sources are not reputable enough to merit inclusion in the lead. Need a peer-reviewed journal? Here you go: "Anarcho-capitalism is a form of anarchism...contemporary anarcho-capitalists are descendants of nineteenth-century individualist anarchists such as Josiah Warren, Lysander Spooner, and Benjamin Tucker" -Brown, Susan Love, The Free Market as Salvation from Government: The Anarcho-Capitalist View, Meanings of the Market: The Free Market in Western Culture, edited by James G. Carrier, Berg/Oxford, 1997, p. 99. (Article is a criticism of anarcho-capitalism. Brown is not an anarcho-capitalist.) You cannot get any more reputable than a peer-reviewed journal. Not only that but the author is a critic of anarcho-capitalism. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheIndividualist_25e6.html" title="User:TheIndividualist">TheIndividualist</a> 05:40, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Nonetheless, that is a hotly disputed assertion evidently, and therefore should only be mentioned in appropriate context, not as a mere one-clause weasel phrase. If we were to state anything in the lead, it should be something to the effect of: "Anti-capitalist anarchists, anarcho-capitalists, and political scientists frequently disagree as to whether or not anarcho-capitalism is a subset of the broader anarchist movement." The controversy has to be adequately documented. -- <a href="../../../w/g/e/User%7EWGee_01b0.html" title="User:WGee">WGee</a> 05:55, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>History, through the writings of virtually all self-declared and important anarchists to date, shows us that anarchism is an ideology dedicated to aboloshing all forms of hierarchy and coercion, including capitalism. It shows us that anti-capitalist anarchism is the only form of anarchism to have really existed, or at least the overwhelmingly dominate one. Any ideology that espouses capitalism is therefore incompatible with this historical precedent and should not be classified alongside the egalitarian ideologies of anarchism. -- <a href="../../../w/g/e/User%7EWGee_01b0.html" title="User:WGee">WGee</a> 03:35, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's patently false that anarchism is opposed to all forms of coercion. Defensive coercion is fine. Even initiatory coercion is fine for some such as anarcho-communists like Johann Most who advocated terrorism.

<p>If it wasn't anarchism it wouldnt have the prefix "anarcho" attached.

<dd>No offence intended, but that is a rather lame rebuttal to what I've written. The semantical meaning of the term is irrelevant as I have stated, nevermind that it was developed by 20th-century anarcho-capitalists who have their own obvious biases. A <i><a href="../../../r/e/d/Reductio_ad_absurdum.html" title="Reductio ad absurdum">reductio ad absurdum</a></i> easily nullifies your inference: if political classifications were based solely on semantics, I could develop a communistic ideology called "communo-capitalism" and correctly declare it a subset of capitalism, even though it is actually contrary to capitalism. Absurd, isn't it? Thus, the semantical meaning of the term, and essentially the term itself, is irrelevant; what matters is its political and historical similarity to anarchism, of which virtually none exists. -- <a href="../../../w/g/e/User%7EWGee_01b0.html" title="User:WGee">WGee</a> 03:51, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>On the Internet, perhaps, but not necessarily in libraries. Unfortunately, though, I don't have access to such a comprehensive library as you do, and am therefore not able to conduct any meaningful bibilographical research right now.

<dd>Another problem is that, because anarcho-capitalism is a relatively new and absolutely uninfluential ideology, there is not much disscussion of it amongst the more reputable, well-known sectors of academia.

<dd>You might want to tone down your rhetoric a bit. Anyways, that doesn't make much sense. The positive claim is that anarcho-capitalism is considered to be a form of anarchism. Therefore, the burden of proof is on you. You feel that you have provided that proof, whereas others do not. If I wanted to show that anarcho-capitalism was not considered to be a form of anarchism, I could let silence speak louder than words. But, in this case, all anybody really needs to do is show the myriad of "mainstream" sources on political philosophy that include anarchism but do not mention anarcho-capitalism at all. --AaronS 04:29, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>Although you're right that my argument in <i>thus far</i> personal opinion, it is intended to note that the insertion of a reference to anarchism in the lead is an ill-conceived and conentious idea. My argument is relevant to the use and placement of sources in this article, and so does matter some. It's not as though I'm not trying to insert any original research into the article.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I don't necessarily have to find a source which states that anarcho-capitalism <i>is not</i> anarchism. As Aaron point out, the fact that many writings on anarchism don't even allude to anarcho-capitalism is evidence enough that its classification as a school of anarchism is contestable. And as I've said before, your interpretation of what is "mainstream" is moot.</p>

<dd>That brings me to my next point: when I spoke of <i>influence</i>, I meant <i>intellectual influence throughout history</i> (although several examples of anarchism in practice have been documented by academics). Anti-capitalist anarchism has dominated anarchist intellectual thought, insofar as to constitute the only credible, historical form of anarchism. Out of all of the important anarchist theorists, none of them claimed to be or are widely considered to be pro-capitalist. Its this historical precedent, as I've stated before, that makes the classifcation of anarcho-capitalism as "anarchist" hotly contested. -- <a href="../../../w/g/e/User%7EWGee_01b0.html" title="User:WGee">WGee</a> 05:16, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Undue weight says "that the article should fairly represent all significant viewpoints that have been published by a reliable source, and should do so in proportion to the prominence of each." In that section equal weight is given to the claim that Medival Iceland had some features of an anarcho-capitalist society and to claim that it "was a communal rather than individualist society". Section can be reduced but I really don't see a point in that. <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVision_Thing_6e8a.html" title="User:Vision Thing">-- Vision Thing --</a> 19:26, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The Journal of Libertarian Studies was created with the undertanding that libertarianism referred to individualist anarchism in the US. Individualist anarchism in the 19th century and early 20th century used to be called libertarianism. Old books about Benjamin Tucker and Lysander Spooner refer to them as "libertarians" and anarchists interchangeably. Libertarianism and anarchism are synonyms in old anarchist literature. Murray Rothbard and others just continued the term for the pro-capitalist individualism. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheIndividualist_25e6.html" title="User:TheIndividualist">TheIndividualist</a> 04:49, 30 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's probably because earlier books were influenced by Proudhon and European anarchism, which was much more significant at the time. In French, the dominant political and philosophical language of the time, and the language of Proudhon, "libertaire" means anarchist, whereas "liberal" means libertarian. Confusing, yes. --AaronS 04:59, 30 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Exactly. Karl Hess founded with Murray Rothbard Left and Right: A Journal of Libertarian Thought in 1965. I think that may have been before the term "anarcho-capitalism" was invented. They just considered themselves anarchists. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheIndividualist_25e6.html" title="User:TheIndividualist">TheIndividualist</a> 05:02, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Improper Citations</span></h2>
<p>Many of the sources now being inserted into the article by TheIndividualist were originally inserted by editors RJII and Hogeye, who have now been banned and have a history of inserting sources that do not back the claim or are not properly referanced (i.e. no page number/chapter for entire books, referancing the editor of a compilation of essays without mention of specific essay/author, etc). Given that these referances were first inserted by dubious sources, and given the high likelihood that theindividualist is a sockpuppet of one of the aforementioned now banned users, I'm calling for a citecheck for this article and several others which have been stuffed with the same sources for the same claims. In particular, I would like to know if the texts actually support the specific claims being made, and will begin to visit my local university library in the coming weeks to check them. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlahblahblahblahblahblah_a472.html" title="User:Blahblahblahblahblahblah">Blahblahblahblahblahblah</a> 12:32, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's probably a good idea. It is true that most of RJII and Hogeye's citations were selectively quoted. Sometimes they would be contradicted on the very same page. --AaronS 13:26, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I would add that it does seem peculiar that <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheIndividualist_25e6.html" title="User:TheIndividualist">TheIndividualist</a> appeared out of nowhere and is making the same arguments and using the same sources in the same fashion and with the same tone as RJII, who, last we heard, victoriously vanished in a cloud of smoke with a maniacal, villainous cackle, after being banned. --AaronS 13:31, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>That's not true. Hogye is banned because of personal attack and RJII for the way he left Wikipedia. Can you show some examples of sources that do not back the claim? <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVision_Thing_6e8a.html" title="User:Vision Thing">-- Vision Thing --</a> 16:41, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>From the Dictionary of Marxist Thought (1992): "Although anarchism rests on liberal intellectual foundations, notably the distinction between state and society, the protean character of the doctrine makes it difficult to disinguish clearly different schools of anarchist thought. But one important distinction is between individualist anarchism and social anarchism. The former emphasizes individual liberty, the sovereignty of the individual, the importance of private property or possession, and the iniquity of all monopolies. It may be seen as liberalism taken to an extreme conclusion. 'Anarcho-capitalism' is <strike>the</strike> a contemporary variant of this school." Intangible 17:18, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, keep in mind that all of your edits -- which are much appreciated -- have been countered by a few users who refuse to budge an inch in the other direction. While I assume that they are acting on good faith, and respect their opinions, TheIndividualist/IndividualistAnarchist and company haven't really tried to reach a compromise at all, whereas a lot of other editors have. The sockpuppet charge, while tiresome, is unfortunately understandable, considering the proven and self-admitted harrassment, disruption, and POV-pishing that has occurred on anarchism-related articles on the part of RJII and Hogeye. Further, it has always been added as an afterthought, and has never really been the meat of anybody's claims. There are other, more important issues at hand. I understand that you feel strongly about the subject of this article, and I respect that. I certainly hope that you won't leave as a result of the recent heated discussion. Your input is appreciated, and you're welcome here.</dd>
<dd>You're right that the sockpuppet argument is very, very difficult to substantiate. But, like I said, I'm sure that, after thinking a bit about the situation, you might understand where some people are coming from. For years, we've dealt with sockpuppet abuse on these articles. The people behind the abuse have no lives outside of Wikipedia and troll it like an AOL chatroom. Sockpuppets are probably Wikipedia's greatest weakness -- along with <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gaming_the_system.html" title="Gaming the system">gaming the system</a>. Both will probably contribute to Wikipedia's demise, if nothing is done about it.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Lead sentence</span></h2>
<p>People keep on changing it with ostensive disregard for the sources discussed on this talk page, and with ostensive disregard for this talk page in general. The current sentence reads as follows: <i>Anarcho-capitalism is an individualist political philosophy that calls for the abolition of the state, replacing tax funded defense of liberty and property with with voluntarily funded private suppliers of a judiciary, policing and defense.</i> This definition is confusing, grammatically awkward, and actually incorrect. It suggests that anarcho-capitalists only advocate the privitization of jurisdiction, policing and defense; in actuality, however, they advocate the privitization of <i>all</i> functions currently carried out by the state.</p>
<p>Here's one verifiable definition: "Anarcho-capitalism is a form of anarchism whose prime tenet is that the free market, unhampered by government intervention, can coordinate all the functions of society currently carried out by the state, including systems of justice and national defense."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Anarcho-capitalism#Introductory_paragraph" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Anarcho-capitalism#Introductory_paragraph" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></p>
<p>Based on this source, I will reinsert my original definition, with some changes: "Anarcho-capitalism is an individualist political philosophy that calls for the abolition of the state and the provision of all of its functions—including jurisdiction, policing, and national defence—by the free market. <i>In the future, I ask that people verify their additions with sources.</i></p>

<dd>The changes, while perhaps less than perfect, did address a few problems with the sentence as you reverted it:
<ul>
<li>Not all functions of the state will continue under AC - some are inherently coercive, and will be abolished</li>
<li>Policing and military defence are not really the same function, and the description doesn't make clear that "national defence" covers defence against internal predators</li>
<li>"Systems of justice" doesn't make clear that both civil courts and criminal justice are included.</li>

<li>That anarcho-capitalists reject "initiatory coercion" is well documented in the lead, so this first sentence will not be misleading. The current wording, I feel, is the clearest and most accurate way to define ancap in one sentence. Plus, it's sourced, unlike some of the alternatives.</li>
<li>These are just a few general examples intended to emphasize the fact that ancaps promote <i>laissez-faire</i> capitalism in <i>all</i> areas of society. Thus, we don't need to be utterly precise in these examples. Remember: this is just the lead; more detail is provided later in the article.</li>
<li>I disagree: both civil courts and criminal courts are part of the justice system, aren't they? This example is intended to be inclusive, not exhaustive.</li>

<dd>Your sentence is bad, just as the source's sentence is bad. "All" of the functions of states would not be replaced. Taxation is a function of the state. Censorship is a function of the state. Prohibition of drugs is a function of the state. Banning private ownership of the means of production is a function of the state. What the state's functions are depends on what state you are talking about. The only functions that would be left to the free market would be provision of non-aggressive functions that states have been known to perform, such as protecting individuals from violence perpetrated by other indivduals.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by O-boy (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_O-boy_357f.html" title="Special:Contributions/O-boy">contribs</a>) (O-Boy).</small></dd>

<dd>I agree, but your propagation of that was ineffective, confusing, and mired by anarcho-capitalist jargon and technicalities. The basic idea of ancap was well-conveyed in my original sentence, no matter how imprecise you believe it was. In any case, I altered the lead sentence to reflect your concerns and the concerns of Argyriou. The result is a slight increase in vagueness; nonetheless, the definition is still factually accurate and as precise as we can muster in one sentence. -- <a href="../../../w/g/e/User%7EWGee_01b0.html" title="User:WGee">WGee</a> 22:25, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The essential services are recognized as such by anarcho-capitalists. They want these to be provide for by the free market. Anarcho-capitalists do not see them to be essential functions of the state.</li>

<dl>
<dd>My suggestion for the lead paragraph:</dd>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>Anarcho-capitalism is an individualist political philosophy that calls for the abolition of the state and the provision of legitimate services usually provided by the state - a judicial system, protection from criminals, and protection from foreign aggression - by the free market. Central to the philosophy is the idea of individual sovereignty and the rejection of initiatory coercion and fraud, including the tax function and monopoly of force of the state. Its proponents see the only just basis for law as arising from the right to non-coercively acquired private property and an unlimited right of contract between individuals. For anarcho-capitalists, property may only be acquired by mixing one's labor with unowned resources (either previously unoccupied or abandoned) or by receiving goods by trade or gift. Anarcho-capitalists reject the state as a systematic aggressor that should be eliminated. Anarcho-capitalists assert that each individual "has the right to own the product that he has made."[1] and that profit is a natural occuring and non-coercive part of trade. This embrace of capitalism leads to considerable tension between anarcho-capitalists and those anarchists who see the rejection of capitalism as being essential to anarchist philosophy, tantamount with rejection of the state.</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dd>Here are my reasons for the changes:
<ul>
<li>There needs to be a distinction between legitimate functions and non-legitimate functions provided by the state. ACers believe that a judicial system, police protection (only against what ACers consider crimes), and national defense, so long as there are still states, are legitimate services, but that a monopolistic government cannot legitimately provide those.</li>
<li>Some functions of the state which are considered legitimate by nearly all non-anarchists are not considered so by ACers - taxation and maintaining a monopoly of force.</li>
<li>The sentence which began <i>Anarcho-capitalists reject the state ...</i> was overblown and redundant, so I trimmed it.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is the concept that needs to be put across. Individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker (predecessor of anarcho-capitalism) explains it like this: "defense is a service like any other service; that it is labor both useful and desired, and therefore an economic commodity subject to the law of supply and demand; that in a free market this commodity would be furnished at the cost of production; that, competition prevailing, patronage would go to those who furnished the best article at the lowest price; that the production and sale of this commodity are now monopolized by the State; and that the State, like almost all monopolists, charges exorbitant prices;... and, finally, that the State exceeds all its fellow-monopolists in the extent of its villainy because it enjoys the unique privilege of compellhlg all people to buy its product whether they want it or not" (O-Boy)</p>
<p>I'd rather give a different description. Instead of political philosophy, I'd say philosophy or philosophy of the individuum, because it certainly is not only a political philosophy - M.S.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Lead paragraph</span></h2>
<p>Here is the lead paragraph as it stands now:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Anarcho-capitalism is an individualist political philosophy that calls for the abolition of the state, and the provision of all goods and services—including essential services such as jurisdiction, policing and defence—by the free market. Central to the philosophy is the idea of individual sovereignty and the rejection of initiatory coercion and fraud, including state-imposed restrictions on commerce. Its proponents see the only just basis for law as arising from the right to non-coercively acquired private property and an unlimited right of contract between individuals. For anarcho-capitalists, property may only be acquired by mixing one's labor with unowned resources (either previously unoccupied or abandoned) or by receiving goods by trade or gift. Anarcho-capitalists reject "the state" as an unjustified, monopolist thief and systematic aggressor that should be eliminated. Anarcho-capitalists assert that each individual "has the right to own the product that he has made."[1] and that profit is a natural occuring and non-coercive part of trade. This embrace of capitalism leads to considerable tension between anarcho-capitalists and those anarchists who see the rejection of capitalism as being essential to anarchist philosophy, tantamount with rejection of the state.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I tried to incorporate the concerns of Argyriou and others into the paragraph without making use of anarcho-capitalist terminology, which can be confusing and off-putting to the uninitiated. For example, what exactly is the "monopoly of force of the state"? What are "legitimate services" in the eyes of anarcho-capitalists? What does "the rejection of initiatory coercion and fraud" entail in the eyes of anarcho-capitalists (I've tried to explain in laymen terms that it entails an opposition to all restrictions on commerce imposed by the state, which seems correct from what I've read in the rest of the article). These vague terms and phrases should not be utilized in the lead, although they may be acceptable in the main body, where they can be explained in detail.</p>
<p>Some constructive input on my edits, and on the lead in general, would be appreciated, as I hope to reach a consensus on the lead sometime soon. But please keep in mind my primary concern while offering a critique: that we should avoid vague terminology in the lead and simply "tell it like it is".</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">My revert</span></h2>
<p>The current version is fine the way it is for the most part, and there are a lot of POV problems with the old version which have already been rectified in recent versions. Editing of the intro by several editors is not signs of controversiality, but most are minor fixes and clarifications. If resurection of the old intro can be justified here on the talk page, please do so; until then we will continue to work on the existing version. Two-Bit Sprite 14:38, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>However, I must say, seeing the size contrast between the old version and new version, I do have to admit that the new version has grown substancially, and has a lot of specific information which is later repeated in other sections. I.e. <i>For anarcho-capitalists, property...</i> might be a bit too much detail for and intro? And the last paragraph I think is well covered already in the History and Influences section... Two-Bit Sprite 14:43, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Problems with the old version which has been resurected:</p>
<ul>
<li>Usage of language like "private property norms" which implies that a) anarcho-capitalists aim for the status quo in terms of property, which is definately not the case, they instead wish to establish much simpler conceptions of property. The "norms" of property involve states and include such things as imminent domain, search and seasure (occasionally without warrent), etc.</li>
<li>"unlimited right of contract" — this is disputed even among anarcho-capitalists. Some ancaps argue that, i.e., one cannot contract oneself into slavery.</li>
<li>"aggressor against sovereign individuals" — uses ancap lingo in the voice of wikipedia, implies that wikipedia assumes that individuals are indeed soverign without question.</li>
<li>"laissez-faire" — does not preclude all forms of state intervention, i.e. from the <a href="../../../l/a/i/Laissez-faire.html" title="Laissez-faire">laissez-faire</a> article, "It is generally understood to be a doctrine opposing economic interventionism and taxation by the state <b>beyond that which is perceived to be necessary to maintain peace, security, and property rights.</b>" (emp. mine).</li>
<li>Talk of a "government monopoly" in the voice of wikipedia — some would argue that the government does not hold strict monopoly as courts, defense and property enforcement are still offered <i>suplementarily</i> on the free market. Again, ancap lingo.</li>
<li>"involuntarily funded through taxation" and "private, competing businesses that provide voluntarily-funded services" — Again, libertarian/ancap jargon, greatly begging the question.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do agree that the recent versions are getting a bit long (see my comments above) but replacing the current version with an older more slanted version is not the solution. Please try to work with the other editors who have spent time and energy attempting to <i>correct</i> instead of going back to those things which we have intentionally removed. Two-Bit Sprite 17:19, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Unlimited right of contract" before that it is stated that each individual is sovereign, which implies no one can own someone else.</dd>

<dd>The article states that <i>anarcho-capitalists believe</i> that individuals are sarcasm. I realize that one could argue that this implies the prohibition of signing oneself into slavery, this is not for wikipedia to judge. This is original research, drawing conclusions in the article which are not backed by sources other than by direvation. Wikipedia does not form conclusions like this, but merely documents the theories and conclusions of others. The language in the old version makes it sound like <i>wikipedia believes</i> that individuals are soverign and that "obviously" this means that one can/cannot sign oneself into slavery.
<dl>
<dd>No this is simple logic. Individual sovereignty implies that no one can own someone else. Your notion "of signing oneself into slavery" is irrelevant to the anarcho-capitalism article. Intangible 19:27, 3 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Now we're into a discussion of the logical coherancy, which is not appropriate on wikipedia, no matter how 'simple' the logic is.

<dd>My point is that the average person defines "politics" in such a way that it would include anarcho-capitalism as a political philosophy and we have no reason to break that convention other than your "philosophical" musings about "no wait, I think politics really means <i>this</i>". The point remains that the primary focus of anarcho-capitalism is the abolition of political government, meaning ancap is a <i>philosophy</i> which concerns itself with <i>politics</i> (it just so happens that it's philosphy on politics is that it should be abolished) therefore it is a <i>political philosophy</i>.

The current revision is confusing, off-putting, and tendentious because of its heavy use of anarcho-capitalist, idiosyncratic jargon, as Two-Bit-Sprite noted. The former lead, which I and others had worked on extensively, is a better platform for improvement and can eventually be modified to everyone's liking, I'm sure. The restoration of the current lead was unnecessary and actually degraded the quality of the article.

<dd>I think the trouble is we're just not operating on the same wavelength here. We don't really understand why you're objecting to calling it a political philosophy, when 90% of anarchist and libertarian movements <i>are</i> political philosophies, and your explainations for the objection have been rather vague, even after we've explained that calling something a political philosophy is not a value judgement on whether it is statist or anti-statist. Especially in the case of anarcho-capitalism, its view that the preservation of public order should be provided by private means <i>is</i> a view on "the enforcement of a legal code by authority." Anarcho-capitalism has strong views on what is and is not a legitimate government, and where a government derives its authority to do what. That makes it a political philosophy by most definitions. You seem to be operating from a different viewpoint, but have taken little time and words to actually <i>explain</i> that viewpoint so that we may debate and achieve consensus.--<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosicrucian_a63e.html" title="User:Rosicrucian">Rosicrucian</a> 16:44, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have explained this. Ancap is no subject of political science because there is almost nothing political. And there is no "politics" in this movement. The only thing which could be political is an "public right" to "ignore" the state. That's all. This is far away from the whole history of political philosophy. The second claim "that calls for the abolition of the state" is also misleading. It is not the intension of Ancaps to take away the state from the whole world or a whole country because it is a individualist ideolgy. But your phrase implies a collectivism. This is wrong. --<a href="../../../u/i/o/User%7EUiofvnondc_49b3.html" title="User:Uiofvnondc">Uiofvnondc</a> 18:18, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sidestepping your usual vague argument about "it's not political," let's take a look at the abolition of the state argument. The article <i>repeatedly</i> reiterates that "Anarcho-capitalists reject the state as a coercive monopoly that derives its income from legal aggression (i.e. taxation) and thereby violates the non-aggression principle." Which means that anarcho-capitalists <i>are</i> calling for the abolition of the state, or at least the abolition of the state <i>as we know it</i>. This is a common thread running throughout the article, and thus deserves to be summarized in the lead sentence or at the least the intro paragraph because it is so entwined with the article itself.--<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosicrucian_a63e.html" title="User:Rosicrucian">Rosicrucian</a> 18:36, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>We have to add something to this example, because it doesn't hold to truth anymore.

<dd>Somalia <b>is</b> ruled by warlords who murder their opponents and loot and destroy their property, thereby violating the non-aggression principle. The country is also ruled by Islamic clerics who impose strict Sharia law in their strongholds. The militias of the Islamic Courts Union and the warlords do not operate out of contract, as they would in anarcho-capitalism; rather, they oppress their subjects with physical intimidation and local hierarchies. Moreover, albeit it a very unathoritative one, Somalia does have an internationally-recognized national government and that does legislate beyond the bounds of natural law. Thus, there can exist a free market economy that is not anarcho-capitalist; your suggestion otherwise is ludicrous, because anarcho-capitalism is much more than an economy, as evidenced by this article. -- <a href="../../../w/g/e/User%7EWGee_01b0.html" title="User:WGee">WGee</a> 20:27, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The U.S. <b>are</b> ruled of a warlord. Somaliland and Puntland <b>are not</b> ruled by "warlords". Every crime violates the non-aggression principle. Must an "ancap society" be without crime? Anarcho-capitalism is not only made by libertarian thinkers but also by economists without NAP-doctrination. And Somalia isn't ruled of Islamic leaders. The Islam is a strong holded religion in Somalia. This is no rule of authoritative people but it is costomary law enforced by private arbitrators. Every Somali may become a private arbitrator but he must seek confidence. This is often near by private property law. Your "internationally-recognized national government" is not present anywhere in the north. Puntland and Somaliland have also sockpuppet "governments" with a laughable budget. A Somali told me something about 15 million $ per annum. I am not clear about this. Probably from international fonds. But interventions of a government is not noticeable in the north. Your governments are a bad joke. Of course, anarcho-capitalism is much more than an economy. I don't deny this. So what? Democracy is also much more than an economy. But when you search a comparison then Somalia is an example (well or not) of a currently stateless society as so much as the U.S. are an example of democrazy society, isn't it? --<a href="../../../u/i/o/User%7EUiofvnondc_49b3.html" title="User:Uiofvnondc">Uiofvnondc</a> 06:37, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Although I'm having much trouble understanding your argument, I can say for sure that your understanding of Somalia is skewed, to say the least. Somalia is ruled by a combination of Islamic militiamen and secular warlords, and their strongholds are not bound by political borders (e.g. Somaliland and Puntland). These two hetereogeneous groups have <i>de facto</i> replaced the government as the rulers of the nation. Much like an authoritarian government, they physically intimidate civilians who oppose them, and through this intimidation they pillage homes as they wish and impose idiosyncaratic laws (such as Sharia law) in their strongholds. Just because a "government" doesn't practically exist, it does not mean that other oppressive rulers have not assumed power. Somalia thus does not resemble an anarcho-capitalist society. Why would any anarcho-capitalist want to associate their ideology with the humanitarian distaster that is Somailia, anyway? -- <a href="../../../w/g/e/User%7EWGee_01b0.html" title="User:WGee">WGee</a> 21:04, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>This is no rule of authoritative people but it is costomary law enforced by private arbitrators.</i> That's an oxymoron: arbitrators are necessarily authoritarian. (Though maybe this oxymoron stems from the fact that English is not your first language?) In any case, the militias are not operating out of voluntary contract, as would be necessary for anarcho-capitalism to exist; rather, they are violently imposing their will upon various, often unconsenting populations. In other words, nobody is voluntarily paying the militias to protect "natural rights"; the militias have arbitrarily decided to rule, with no limit to the extent of their authority. Surely that cannot be compatible with the anarchist ideal that anarcho-capitalism claims to espouse. -- <a href="../../../w/g/e/User%7EWGee_01b0.html" title="User:WGee">WGee</a> 21:04, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Before you want to discuss with me you have to accept some prepositions</p>
<ol>
<li>There is no "the one Somalia" with struggling (islamic) "warlords" everywhere. The North is quiet and peaceful. When you make all in one judgements without any proof then I must dismiss you. When you say that "Islamic militiamen and secular warlords ... are not bound by political borders" then just this is an image of "private security agencies". They are defending their property (rightful or not). So they are "property owner" with the same right for correctness.</li>
<li>Nobody says that Somalia, resp. the quiet and peaceful part, is an ideal of an anarcho-capitalist image or that it is an anarcho-capitalist society. But the comparsion is allowed in the same way as democrats would claim that the U.S. are a democracy. In your understanding, the U.S. is no democracy since it doesn't fullfil the ideal of a democracy. Furthermore there is no democracy in the whole world because all states with "democratic" governments fail in to be rightful democratic. So, what's wrong with your understanding? Quite simply, anarcho-capitalism is only a meta-system of thinking like perfect democracy is only an theoretical ideal which can never be reached.</li>
<li>The fall of government is no "humanitarian distaster" in Somalia. Obviously you are bad informed.</li>
<li>When disputing parties voluntarily agree to an arbitrator then this is not "authoritarian". Please stop with telling your private wisdom.</li>
<li>One of the strengths of Somali law is that it is close to natural law as Van Notten says in his book. You must not agree. I tell you only a fact of an imho reputable source.</li>
<li>Last but not least. Conventionalism to the NAP in a ancap society is desirable in the libertarian impact. But there is no requirement in a stateless society to an "anarcho-capitalist" to act on NAP. The anarcho-capitalism of Freedman doesn't need any NAP. --<a href="../../../u/i/o/User%7EUiofvnondc_49b3.html" title="User:Uiofvnondc">Uiofvnondc</a> 09:39, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Earlier, we'd moved the Libertarianism sidebar down because having it right beside the anarchism one squishes the layout terribly. The discussion is above. I don't mind moving the Libertarianism sidebar up a bit, but I do think we can't have them right next to each other. It's just messy.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Templates</span></h2>
<p>While I agree that both libertarianism and anarchism play a very large role in anarcho-capitalists theories, I have to object with both templates being at the top for asthetic reasons. I think we need to pick one, and move the other down. In 1024x768, having both templates at the top squeezes the intro such that it doesn't all fit in the first screenful. I feel the intro is perfectly sized as it stands, and could withstand any reduction, so I say the only option is to move one of the templates...

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Critique of Uiofvnondc's last edit</span></h2>
<p>Firstly, there are several spelling and grammatical errors, but those are minor slights. Primarily, the problems are, in contextual order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Confusing the reader by lack of explaining the theory as a <i>political</i> philosophy, and then immediately discussing politics. Reference to "the state" outside of the context of politics is confusing as it has multiple meanings. State of mind? Is it refering to the phyisical concept of <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_%28physics%29.html" title="State (physics)">state</a>?</li>
<li>Immediately explaining the ideology in negative terms (i.e. what it <i>rejects</i>).</li>
<li>"The free market ideal of a stateless society..." sounds like wikipedia is claiming the the ideal <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_market.html" title="Free market">free market</a> <i>is</i> a stateless society, when plenty of people disagree (see most <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economists.html" title="Economists">economists</a>).</li>
<li>"profided by an economy and social system of privacy of <i>all</i> goods and services..." — mispelling of the word "provided" and misuse of the word "<a href="../../../p/r/i/Privacy.html" title="Privacy">privacy</a>". Also, undue weight with the italics; "all" means all, no need to over-stress it, you are not argueing with anyone in this article (which is what it sounds like you are trying to do).</li>
<li>Makes reference to mysterious "Rothbard" figure without explanation or even a full name or wikilink. Even if this were provided, it is a bit early to introduce historical figures until the concept itself is fully explained.</li>
<li>"Anarcho-capitalists believe that markets don't require collective regulation to be successful..." — still has an antagonistic tone, as though the article is a rebuttle to something, which it isn't supposed to be. Sounds like Wikipedia is preaching to the "evil collectivists". This is not encyclopedic.</li>

<dd>Sources or not, I don't see how it is <i>not</i> a theory concerning politics. The fact that it is <i>against</i> politics is proof that it <i>concerns itself with politics</i> thus making it a <i>philosophy of politics</i>. I don't see how this can be questioned. Saying I need sources to "proove" this, is like saying I need sources that say it is a <i>theory</i>. It simply is so by definition of the term "political". It is a philosophy that criticises politics, therefor it is a philosophy about politics, plain and simple. --Two-Bit Sprite 18:19, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I haven't the slightest clue why you think referring to anarcho-capitalism as a <i>political</i> philosophy is an NPOV violation.

<dd>@WGee: In your "referenced article" is a list of "Influential political philosophers". For example, Hayek shall be one but Rothbard not. Or Friedman: Friedman has coined his important part to anarcho-capitalism. How can Friedman be a political philosopher? When anarcho-capitalism must be a political philosophy then every person coining the term must be anyway a political philosopher or there must be at least an other way to coin the term but which one? There is no remark about it but political shall be so important that is must be noticed. Why? To speak with your words: I haven't the slightest clue why you think referring to anarcho-capitalism as a <i>political</i> philosophy. I have no POV-problem with "ideology". The only thing of anarcho-capitalism which could be "political" would be a public right to ignore/leave the state to an own sovereignty. (And this is now my unreferenced sysnthesis of "political".) The rest is absolutely apolitical. You can say it is also a "social theory". Ok. I would agree. But a social theory must not be political. To say, it is political, is far away from of a neutral tone and far away of the actually practise in political science. --<a href="../../../u/i/o/User%7EUiofvnondc_49b3.html" title="User:Uiofvnondc">Uiofvnondc</a> 21:02, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article's FA status is moot, because it is currently under review, and as comments have shown, it probably should not have ever been accorded such status. We're working towards that goal, now, but it will be impossible as long as this discussion is occurring. If you do not think that anarcho-capitalism is a political philosophy, then I invite you to write a treatise on how a philosophy can discuss politics without being political, advocate altering politics without being political, and so on, and then have it be published. I think that you may be confusing a notion (which, I believe, probably does not exist) like politic<i>ist</i> with a descriptor like politic<i>al</i>. The former would denote advocacy, whereas the latter simply informs us that it deals with questions of politics. For anarcho-capitalism to be <i>anti</i>-political, it would have to advocate the rejection of politics in favor of I do not know what. Even then, it would simply be an anti-political political philosophy. --AaronS 13:02, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>on how a philosophy can discuss politics</i> -- Which politics? The NAP is no politics. To reject the state is no politics, economic theory is no politics and so on. <i>without being political</i> -- What is political? What do you mean exactly? <i>advocate altering politics without being political</i> -- Only a small and inapplicable part of all ancap theories advocate anyway an "altering" of politics. Anarcho-capitalists wouldn't longer write critics on the state when they could simply secede. And when they could secede then they wouldn't make any critics about the state or any artful suggestions about politics because it wouldn't be their matter. It is only a statist view that anarchists are involved into politics. --<a href="../../../u/i/o/User%7EUiofvnondc_49b3.html" title="User:Uiofvnondc">Uiofvnondc</a> 13:38, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't know what are you trying to prove but here is one clear definition from Rothbard: "Political philosophy is that subset of ethical philosophy which deals specifically with politics, that is, the proper role of violence in human life (and hence the explication of such concepts as crime and property)." <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVision_Thing_6e8a.html" title="User:Vision Thing">-- Vision Thing --</a> 19:27, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This defintion is onesided. It is correct that politics is the proper role of violence in human life. But to say that property comes from the proper role of violence in human life depends on the term property itself. Rothbard used consequently in this book his natural law persepective to declare universal public rules. But many anarcho-capitalists don't follow natural law rules. For example, property is a voluntary treaty within two parties without violence. Nobody calls this "politics". It is not a treaty and it is not allotted property for the thirth and forth party or person. So, this property is no public rule for all and it so no deal with the proper role of violence because it is voluntary. You may say that Rothbard's theory is a natural law political philosophy. OK. But is anarcho-capitalism a natural law philosophy? Or is anarcho-capitalism a political philosophy by Rothbards controversial natural law part? No. No. No. This is much too easy. This leads to wrong assumptions and therefore it is POV. --<a href="../../../u/i/o/User%7EUiofvnondc_49b3.html" title="User:Uiofvnondc">Uiofvnondc</a> 08:01, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><a href="../../../d/e/d/Deductive_reasoning.html" title="Deductive reasoning">deductive reasoning</a>: Your premise is wrong or at least inexact. <s>Political philosophy</s><u>Anarcho-capitalism</u> is not the study of ...

This is forbidden by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOR" class="extiw" title="w:NOR">W:NOR</a>.</li>

Rothbards effort and intension was always to establish a "philosophy of liberty" which would be pertinent to the political scene. Of course, his wish was to construct a <i>political</i> philosophy of liberty because this would mean at least that his ideas of liberty would be affiliated anyway in the political sciences. His work "Ethics of Liberty" "attempts ... to set forth a systematic ethical theory of liberty. It is not, however, a work in ethics per se, but only in that subset of ethics devoted to political philosophy." So, he wanted that other people would assimilate his ideas into contemporary political philosophy. This had not happened because political philosophers in whole history have made only positive approaches of any political systems or hierachical public orders. Also the classic anarchist philosphers like Prodhun aimed to an authoritative political order. Rothbards work is until today absolutely not compatible to political philosophy. To claim it would be purely political now is a new and unusual thesis in the political scieces. If you reflect to a vernacular sense then it would be a weasel term. --<a href="../../../u/i/o/User%7EUiofvnondc_49b3.html" title="User:Uiofvnondc">Uiofvnondc</a> 09:58, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Okay, I've read your correction. However, anarcho-capitalism <i>does</i> have a view on "law and the enforcement of a legal code by authority." That view is that the state does not have any special authority to enforce a legal code, and that its practices in doing so are illegitimate and monopolistic. As we've been stating all along, even being antipolitical is a political viewpoint.--<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosicrucian_a63e.html" title="User:Rosicrucian">Rosicrucian</a> 16:25, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, now you mean, "a view on" is "the study of". Which sense shall it make in our discussion when you bend the terms as you need it? The view that the state would have no right to enforce a legal code is no study of law and the enforcement of a legal code by authority. The task of political philosophy was always to develop political theories of law and law enforcement to justify and establish public rules. Anarcho-capitalism cannot deliver any contribution to this because it would be a contradiction in itself.

<p>1. I have already answered to this at 09:58, 8 August 2006 (UTC) 2. libertarianism and political philosophy - what a hard and overweight word! Walter Block (scholar, Austrian School) writes exceptionally: "Libertarianism is a political philosophy. It concerned <i>solely</i> with the proper use of force. Its core premise is that it should be illegal to threaten or initiate violence against a person or his property without his permission; force is justified only in defense or retaliation. That is it, in a nutshell.

<dd>OK, but it seems odd that you'd want to confine me to the use of two dictionaries. . . According to Webster's dictionary, political means "of, relating to, involving, or involved in politics and especially party politics" or "of or relating to government, a government, or the conduct of government." Both of those definitions are applicable to anarcho-capitalism. In any case, Vision Thing has already presented sources attesting to anarcho-capitalism's status as a political philosophy, and I have directed you to <a href="../../../i/d/e/Ideologies_of_parties.html" title="Ideologies of parties">Ideologies of parties</a>, which lists anarcho-capitalism as a political ideology.

Besides, your understanding of the word 'philosophy' is a bit odd. I would say that 'science' is a "field of study", but philosophy is "Love and pursuit of wisdom by intellectual means and moral self-discipline."<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/philosophy" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/philosophy" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> Two-Bit Sprite 12:49, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The theory about the legitimacy of the state is only political by the fact that one can deduce a public right to secede. The core is much more. Economics, social theory, ideology criticism, private law enforcemnt, private security, private money, ethics, classic liberal history and so on.

<dd>You are still argueing in circles. You admit that there at least some political aspect to it, yet reject the whole thing as non-political? The economics, social theory, etc all stem from this <i>political</i> insite of the right to reject coercive institutions, plus some abstract theorizing about how society would evolve to deal with the lack of a state. Two-Bit Sprite 15:12, 10 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>On the whole it is non-poltical. How can you deny this? You have a statist view. The anarcho-capitalist social and economic theory is also valid when there would be no state. Maybe nobody would have constructed such theories without states or other mafias but something is not political only by the fact that it probably wouldn't exist without a state. For example, a book about the history of U.S. governments is only a bibliography. It wouldn't exist without states. But it is absolutely non-political. --<a href="../../../u/i/o/User%7EUiofvnondc_49b3.html" title="User:Uiofvnondc">Uiofvnondc</a> 16:04, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Anarcho-capitalists postulate on how a state-less society would operate, but the primary arguments of anarcho-capitalism are its criticisms of the state; the rest is orthogonal. Ancapism is not in and of itself an economic theory — most anarcho-capitalists embrace Austrian economics, but this does not make it the core of ancapism. Look at the majority of Rothbard's books, most of them are <i>about</i> the state, and are criticisms and attacks on the state. Two-Bit Sprite 19:53, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well I think <a href="../../../u/i/o/User%7EUiofvnondc_49b3.html" title="User:Uiofvnondc">User:Uiofvnondc</a> is claiming that anarcho-capitalism might not in itself give rise to political actions, but that is not wholy correct. Rothbard would argue that there exists a political philosophy within libertarianism (and thus anarcho-capitalism), that would entail a strategy that holds liberty as it highest political end, and searches for means that will give rise to liberty in the quickest possible way. In an anarcho-capitalist society this question of course cannot exist, since everyone will live in complete liberty, with no political ends that come to mind.

<dd>I know that Rothbard followed a strategy to construct a "political philosophy of liberty" in his book "Ethics of Liberty".

<dl>
<dd>This is not true. Hoppe writes: "Rothbard was the creator of a system of social and political philosophy based on economics and ethics as its cornerstones." ... "Rothbard's unique contribution is the rediscovery of and philosophy, and the systematic reconstruction and conceptual integration of modern, marginalist economics and natural-law political philosophy into a unified moral science: libertarianism." ... " Accordingly, Rothbard saw himself in the role of a political philosopher as well as an economist essentially as a preserver and defender of old, inherited truths, and his claim to originality, like that of Mises, was one of utmost modesty. Like Mises, his achievement was to hold onto and restate long-ago established insights and repair a few errors within a fundamentally complete intellectual edifice."</dd>

<dd>I did some research and according to Murray Rothbard, it doesn't have to have a coercive monopoly on defense services to be a state. It can simply be something that taxes. Here is a quote: "Let me say from the beginning that I define the State as that institution which possesses one or both (almost always both) of the following properties: (1) it acquires its income by the physical coercion known as "taxation"; and (2) it asserts and usually obtains a coerced monopoly of the provision of defense service (police and courts) over a given territorial area. Any institution, not possessing either of these properties is not and cannot be, in accordance with my definition, a "State"."

<dd>This clause is false: "Anarcho-capitalists assert that that each individual has the right to own the product that he has made. . ." Rothbard's pertinent quotation says: ". . .if every man has the right to own his own body and if he must use and transform material natural objects in order to survive, then he has the right to own the product that he has made." In this quotation, he is referring to natural resources that were previously unowned. In other words, if one mixes one's labour with <i>unowned natural resources</i>, then, and only then, does it become his property. If one is under the contract of a corporation and manufactures a computer, however, that computer does not become his property, even though it is the product that he as made.

<dd>As it was said in the same sentence, property can be legitimately obtained through trade, gift, or original appropriation. Work contract is a form of trade; one trades future products of his labor for money (wage). Nobody has stolen product of his labor from him, he simply traded it for money. <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVision_Thing_6e8a.html" title="User:Vision Thing">-- Vision Thing --</a> 19:48, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, one could be conservative and say that it is <i>misleading</i>; but if it is misleading, it is inherently false (my logic being that if it is only "half-true", it is essentially not true, i.e. false). We cannot make such general statements about anarcho-capitalism in this case; we must clarify what Rothbard means when he says "he has the right to own the product that he has made."</dd>

<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutualism_%28economic_theory%29.html" title="Mutualism (economic theory)">Mutualists</a>, other individualist anti-capitalist anarchists, and some socialists believe, unconditionally, in "the individual's right to possess what he or she produced." <a href="http://www.infoshop.org/faq/secA1.html#seca14" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.infoshop.org/faq/secA1.html#seca14" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> Anarcho-capitalists, on the other hand, believe in the individual's right to possess what he or she produced, only if the product was made using previously unowned natural resources. And to address your point, Vision Thing, (assuming I understand it correctly) trade does not necessarily imply a contractual division of labour, for trade is possible in anarchist economic systems such as <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutualism_%28economic_theory%29.html" title="Mutualism (economic theory)">mutualism</a>, which do not recognize a division of labour. Even if your statement were true, Vision Thing, we shouldn't be confusing or misleading readers with vague implications or paradoxes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Thus, to say, unconditionally, that "Anarcho-capitalists assert that each individual has the right to own the product that he has made" is essentially false, because anarcho-capitalists only believe this to be true in a particular case: when one mixes one's labour with an unowned natural resource. (Note that in the paragraph from which the quotation is derived, Rothbard was specifically talking about the appropriation of "<b>material natural objects</b> in order to survive": that is, natural resources. In other words, "product", in that context, means "that which is made using unowned natural resources.")</dd>

<dd>What socialists are you talking about? The anarcho-communists don't think "the individual's right to possess what he or she produced." They say an individual has a right to be provided what he "needs" by the community. There is no right to individually own what you produce in anarcho-communism. If you're talking about the self-proclaimed "socialist" Benjamin Tucker, he is the same as the anarcho-capitalists as owning what you produced from the earth's resources or recieved through trade. The exception is on land, where if you stop using it, you don't own it anymore. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThat%27sHot_b6db.html" title="User:That'sHot">That'sHot</a> 03:36, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Right. That's what seperates individualist from collectivist anarchism......the right to individually own what you produce instead of it going into a collective pool where it is distributed according to need. That's why anarcho-capitalism is considered an individualist form of anarchism. All individualists oppose the authority of the community to decide (such as through democratic process) who needs what. If you produce it, you own it, until you decide to trade it for something else. I don't know why you say it's a false statement for Rothbard. Neither Rothbard or Tucker would think that if you take someone else's property and produce something out of it that it's yours. It only applies if you're working with materials that haven't already been turned into property by someone else. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThat%27sHot_b6db.html" title="User:That'sHot">That'sHot</a> 03:48, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You didn't understood me correctly, I'm not saying that trade necessarily implies a contractual division of labor. I'm saying that contract between employee and employer is a form of trade.

<dd>Believe it or not, speaking as a former entrepreneur, telling people what to do is labor. People need others to tell them what to do or little gets accomplished on the job. A lot of people choose to work for others exactly because they want someone else to tell them what to do instead of taking their own initiative to create their own jobs and tell themselves what to do. Most people prefer to have their hand held and be guided around, and that is the job of the manager or business owner. When people go to work for another, an exchange is made. "You perform the labor of telling me what to do, and I perform the labor of doing it because I don't know what to do and I need someone making sure that I don't slack off." If the business owner/manager doesn't peform the labor of guiding and pressuring the employees to produce, they will slack off, the business will fail, and everybody will be out in the street. Not everyone has the initiative and discipline to keep themselves from slacking off and not everyone knows what to do to make a living. That's where the employer comes in. A trade is made. Both parties labor in different ways. Besides managing the employees, you have to manage the cash flow and make sure the business stays liquid, you have to manage inventory, you have to negotiate with suppliers and merchants. Sometimes you even have to haggle and bribe government officials in order to get around oppressive regulations that interfere with the free market, especially here in Brasil. Anyone who thinks running a business with employees is not labor intensive is living in a fantasy world. When smoeone goes to work for an employer they are relieving themselves of a lot of labor and headaches. It is a trade. Like VisionThing said, it's a division of labor. <a href="../../../d/t/c/User%7EDTC_5378.html" title="User:DTC">DTC</a> 20:37, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I see that Anarcho-capitalism is listed as needing a mediator.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Taking a break</span></h2>
<p>I'm taking a break from these articles. There is far too much sock puppetry going on. Those involved might find it amusing, for whatever reason, or might believe that they're spreading the <i>T</i>ruth, but it's actually quite silly. I've never understood why so many evangelicals were attracted to Wikipedia, as if people came to Wikipedia to do scholarly research, rather than the leisurely perusal of articles for their own enjoyment. But, people are strange. I had my fun with this article, but I feel no need to engage in the kinds of games that some people here, and their sock puppets, seem so fond of. Engaging in arguments for the sake of argument, or to keep track of points, and engaging in hot-headed Internet disputes, are two things that I grew out of at the end of high school. --AaronS 19:22, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your temporary leave of absence is well warranted. I, too, have grown annoyed by the fanatical polemicism of the sockpuppets, which is why I've decided to stop editing this article for a while.
