<p>The game is set in the years following June 29475; the current game year is 29481. The story of Anarchy Online revolves primarily around two factions, the <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megacorp.html" title="Megacorp">hypercorporation</a> Omni-Tek and the rebel worker caste, the Clans. These two factions are fighting for control of Rubi-Ka. In addition to these two, there is a third faction of Neutral observers, people who have decided to take no side in the conflict. This conflict has been waged on and off for centuries. In addition, there have been larger conflicts between Omni-Tek and other corporations over the control of Rubi-Ka.</p>
<p>Rubi-Ka, a seemingly useless desert planet, is of such tremendous importance because it is the only known source in the universe of the fictional substance <i>notum</i>. Omni-Tek, having been granted exclusive ownership rights to the planet, controlled notum for many years and benefited tremendously when it was discovered that the mineral would revolutionize, and eventually become the key component of, <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nanotechnology.html" title="Nanotechnology">nanotechnology</a>. The discovery of notum's properties led to the development of technologies that seem very much like <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magic_%28gaming%29.html" title="Magic (gaming)">magic</a>, including programs that create things such as fire and ice, heal injury, shield people from harm, affect their physical bodies, and even achieve <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resurrection.html" title="Resurrection">resurrection</a>. Notum even makes its way into the very genetic makeup of some sub-breeds of humans.</p>
<p>Due to Omni-Tek's unfettered control of Rubi-Ka, the corporation was largely free to do as it wished with its colonists and the planet. For most of the early years, Omni-Tek did its best to treat its people well, even to the point of receiving commendations for its treatment of workers. However, over the centuries, Omni-Tek's policies degraded, until finally, approximately 500 years after the planet was first settled, a significant number of poorly-treated colonists rebelled and began to secretly trade stolen notum to a rival corporation. This led to a series of wars between Omni-Tek and the colonists, and between Omni-Tek and its rival corporations.</p>
<p>The background of the game is described in greater detail in the book <i><a href="http://www.anarchy-online.com/content/game/story/past/novel/" class="external text" title="http://www.anarchy-online.com/content/game/story/past/novel/" rel="nofollow">Prophet Without Honor: Anarchy Online Book 1</a></i>, by the Anarchy Online creator <a href="../../../r/a/g/Ragnar_T%C3%B8rnquist_001e.html" title="Ragnar Tørnquist">Ragnar Tørnquist</a>. A detailed timeline of events, from the discovery of Rubi-Ka until 29479, is available at the official <a href="http://www.anarchy-online.com/content/game/story/past/timeline/" class="external text" title="http://www.anarchy-online.com/content/game/story/past/timeline/" rel="nofollow">Rubi-Ka Timeline</a> page.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchy_Online_6871.html" title="Edit section: Character Creation &amp; Professions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Character Creation &amp; Professions</span></h2>
<p>Players are presented with four breeds each with male or female choices, except for the neuter Atrox race. Breeds affect a character's primary abilities, which will affect the distribution of improvement points in the skill system later on. There are four breeds: <b>Atrox</b>, big and strong but not too smart; <b>Nanomage</b>, frail but intellectually developed; <b>Solitus</b>, effective at any task, but excellent in none; and <b>Opifex</b>, physically lacking, but agile and cunning.</p>
<p>After the selection of a breed, players choose from a multitude of faces, their height, and their body size, then select one of 14 professions:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Adventurer</b> — A generalist profession, the Adventurer combines a balance of weapons and nanotechnology with a deep understanding of nature, which enables him to morph himself and others into several animal forms conveying various benefits. He is adept with both pistols and one-handed bladed weapons, typically wielding a pair of either at once. The Adventurer can serve as a front-line combatant and a secondary healer, with a healing ability second only to Doctors.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Agent</b> — The Agent is a ranged combatant who fights with a combination of stealth and disguise. He favors rifles, especially those capable of the high-damage special <i>Aimed Shot</i> attack that can only be used while hidden. Agents are able to temporarily assume the guise of other professions, albeit with significant penalties, and gain use of items and nanoprograms normally exclusive to the imitated class.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Bureaucrat</b> — Bureaucrats use nanoprograms to hinder, immobilize, and pacify enemies, either singly or in crowds. They also use nanoprograms to damage foes directly, as well as summon a robotic servant and use mind-control on up to two enemies, all of whom can be ordered to fight on the Bureaucrat's behalf. In a nod to the stereotypical image of bureaucrats, the profession features formal suits, briefcases and Bureaucrat-only coffee machines.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Doctor</b> — Doctors are the primary healers in the game. They use a range of nanotechnology to keep characters alive, from maximum health bonuses to continual health-replenishing effects to instantaneous healing. They slow enemies' attacks and whittle them down with damage-over-time nanoprograms.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Enforcer</b> — Enforcers are the primary <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tank_%28computer_gaming%29.html" title="Tank (computer gaming)">tank</a> profession of Anarchy, front-line combatants with the potential to excel with any melee weapon type. They protect teammates by attracting the attention of nearby enemies onto themselves. They protect themselves through nanotechnology that boosts their health and absorbs damage on their behalf.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Engineer</b> — The Engineer creates, augments, repairs and controls fearsome combat robots. Defensively, Engineers provide a variety of shielding effects that reduce damage to their teammates and/or injure the enemies who attacked. Engineers also have an affinity for crafting items. Engineers also have the ability to warp players to the Engineer's current position.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Fixer</b> — The Fixer is a master of escape and shady acquisitions. He can greatly boost characters' running speeds and can bring characters into an alternate version of one of the game's global transportation systems — one with a significantly greater number of destinations. In combat, a Fixer keeps his foes at a distance both by hindering their movement and by augmenting his own, all the while pelting them with his favorite submachine gun. Fixers also use nanotechnology to become difficult to hit, and what few injuries they do suffer are treated by continual health-replenishing effects.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keeper</b> — The Keeper is the first of two professions introduced in the Shadowlands expansion, and is similar to the fantasy RPG <a href="../../../p/a/l/Paladin_%28character_class%29.html" title="Paladin (character class)">paladin</a>. Keepers have a range of nanoprograms that provide continual benefits to themselves and all nearby teammates (including damage increases, health and nano regeneration, and armour improvements). They prefer to fight in melee combat with two-handed edged weapons.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Martial Artist</b> — An offensively-leaning front-line combatant, the Martial Artist eschews weapons in favor of his bare hands, a multitude of special attacks and nanoprograms boosting the chance for critical hits. As a defense, Martial Artists evade most blows and heal the ones that land.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Meta-Physicist</b> — Meta-Physicists are exemplified by their trio of individually-controllable pets that they use to attack enemies, pacify enemies, and heal allies, respectively. These pets can be temporarily improved by the Meta-Physicist as well. MPs also use nanoprograms to damage foes directly, weaken and slow enemies' attacks, and greatly increase their allies' nanoprogram skills.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Nano-Technician</b> — The Nano-Technician uses nanoprograms to cause damage, either to single targets or to all foes nearby. They also immobilize and pacify single enemies, or blind them so their weapons are less effective. Nano-Technicians also wield the program "Nullity Sphere", which immobilizes them for a small period of time but grants total reflection of all damage except incoming reflection damage from attacking shielded enemies.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Shade</b> — The second profession introduced in the Shadowlands expansion, the Shade is this game's version of the fantasy RPG <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thief_%28character_class%29.html" title="Thief (character class)">assassin</a>. Shades favor offense heavily over defense. In exchange for an inability to wear most protective gear, they can cause unrivaled damage with their piercing melee weapons. Their strikes may steal health from their victims, or afflict them with further damage over time or other debilitating effects.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Soldier</b> — Soldiers are a ranged, front-line combatant favoring assault rifles, heavy weapons, or a pair of high-damage pistols. Much like Enforcers, Soldiers taunt nearby enemies, living through the subsequent attack with the help of nanotechnology that partially reflects some or a majority of that enemy's attacks back at it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Trader</b> — A Trader's defining characteristic is <i>trading</i> — taking health, nanoenergy, armor, or all weapon and casting skills from his enemies to improve his own, as well as lending any of these from himself to his allies. Foes that still prove troublesome can be immobilized or pacified. A Trader's weapon of choice is his trusty shotgun. Outside battle, Traders have an affinity for crafting items and for improving other players' abilities to do so.</li>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchy_Online_6871.html" title="Edit section: Skill System">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Skill System</span></h3>
<p><b>Base skills:</b> As in many RPGs, characters in Anarchy Online gain <a href="../../../e/x/p/Experience_point.html" title="Experience point">experience points</a>, and thus levels, through defeating enemies and completing missions. However, a character's level has almost no direct impact on his capabilities. Instead, the game is skill-based. Each level awards the character with a number of Improvement Points, which may be spent at any time to raise skills of the player's choice. It is these skills that determine what a character is capable of doing. The improvement cost of each skill depends on profession; however, no skill is denied outright to anyone. Since there are 85 improvable skills, character development is flexible and complex.</p>
<p><b>Perks:</b> The perk system adds skills to the base skills a player has earned. Players earn one perk point every 10 levels, and one perk point each level after they reach level 200 (40 total points). These points are used on so called "perk lines", most of which have 3 to 10 levels of improvement that stack with each other. Each perk may have a bonus to a skill(s), a powerful new ability, or both. There are over 30 perk lines in-game. Unlike base skills, perks can be reset and reused as many times as the player wishes with a 2 hour wait period in between. These are only available to those with the Shadowlands or Alien Invasion expansions.</p>
<p><b>Research:</b> Anarchy Online's third skill system comes in the form of research. Research is gained by designating a percentage of your earned xp towards research lines (can be changed in real-time through the GUI with no time limits). Much like perks, each profession has around 9 research lines, each of which have up to 10 levels of improvement. While the abilities that come with research lines are nowhere near as powerful as their perk couterparts, they offer some very nice skill bonuses. Research is only avaiblable to those with the Lost Eden "expansion".</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchy_Online_6871.html" title="Edit section: PvP and Faction PvP">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">PvP and Faction PvP</span></h3>
<p>The war between the Omni-Tek corporation and the Clans continues in the form of <a href="../../../p/l/a/Player_versus_player.html" title="Player versus player">player versus player</a> combat. Designated areas allow characters to freely attack anyone of similar level but from a different faction. A player may also flag himself or enter special arenas to allow combat even against members of his own side.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchy_Online_6871.html" title="Edit section: Land Control">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Land Control</span></h3>
<p>Factional PvP is further supported by the introduction of tower sites and battlestations in the Notum Wars booster pack and the Lost Eden expansion, in which players can fight to control different areas. The benefits of control include experience bonuses for one's entire faction, the right to construct buildings that provide skill bonuses to the player or his entire org, and bragging rights.</p>

<p>There are a variety of social elements in Anarchy Online, ranging from emotes to social clothing. Over 200 new social clothing items were added with Alien Invasion, on top of the hundreds of existing social clothes. A variety of emotes are also available to express emotions or dance at parties.</p>

<p>The in-game currency is the <i>credit</i>. Players can negotiate the live sale or barter of items between themselves, or may use player shops provided by the Alien Invasion expansion for transactions. Nearly any item can also be sold to vendor terminals or NPCs for credits.</p>

<p>Special terminals allow players to generate private missions in dynamically-generated indoor zones. Players can customize many of the mission's details, such as how powerful its enemies will be, what tactics they prefer to use, and whether they are more likely to be humanoid or creatures. The mission will also have an objective, such as defeating a named enemy within the mission area or locating a randomly-placed item, and a reward consisting of an item plus some combination of experience and credits. Players can complete only the mission's objective, ignoring all else within the mission, purely to gain the reward (which is known as <i>blitzing</i>), or they can defeat all the enemies prior to accomplishing the objective for incidental treasure and experience, plus bonus experience and special tokens that can be accumulated and used to upgrade particular items.</p>

<p>There are several skills that can be used to create or modify armor, weapons, implants, and generally most items in the game. These are commonly known as <i>tradeskills</i>, and are increased the same way as other skills, meaning a player will often need to decide between developing his character's ability to create items or to fight. Also, like all skills, they are more costly for some professions to develop than for others.</p>

<p>Anarchy Online's servers automatically generate multiple instances of heavily-populated zones.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchy_Online_6871.html" title="Edit section: Transportation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Transportation</span></h3>
<p>Three forms of global transportation exist in the game world: Whompahs, the Grid, and the Fixer Grid.</p>
<ul>
<li>Whompahs are point-to-point <a href="../../../t/e/l/Teleportation.html" title="Teleportation">teleportation</a> booths that connect key cities in a sparse network. Because of this, it can take multiple trips, sometimes through hostile territory, to reach one's final destination. On the upside, all whompah booths can be used by anyone simply by entering them.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In contrast to whompahs, the Grid is a hub. Grid travel involves exactly two trips: one into the Grid, one out. Characters enter the Grid at terminals in key locations throughout the world, travel directly to their desired exit terminal, and leave. Unlike the whompah, Grid terminals require varying amounts of Computer Literacy skill to use.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Fixer Grid is accessed via special keys that only Fixers can produce. It may be entered anywhere the normal Grid can, but has different and more plentiful exit locations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Several single-passenger vehicles exist for personal travel to other sites. The most common by far are variants of the flying, stealth-jet-shaped Yalmaha, though the land-bound Kodaik [<i>sic</i>] ground vehicle can be seen on occasion. Mechanized walking vehicles added by the "Lost Eden" expansion can be used to travel. Other craft exist but are rarely used due to having very specialized utility or being exceedingly difficult to acquire.</p>

<p>Many MMORPGs allow players to equip various armors, weapons, and jewelry to improve their performance. Anarchy Online goes two steps further. First, each beneficial nanoprogram affecting a character takes up a certain amount of "nanocontrol units", or NCUs. Players can improve their characters' memory gear to allow more, and more powerful, programs to be applied to them. Second, characters can wear an entire additional set of equipment inside their bodies in the form of <a href="../../../i/m/p/Implant_%28medicine%29.html" title="Implant (medicine)">implants</a> and advanced ancient <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symbiant.html" title="Symbiant">symbiants</a>.</p>

<p>The game features insurance terminals where players can "save" their character. The terminal captures a character at a particular moment of time, and upon the character's death, the terminal recalls and resurrects the character at its location. The act of resurrection has a negative impact on the character, termed "resurrection shock," which temporarily reduces skills.</p>
<p>In addition, upon dying, all experience that the character gained since the last time he either insured himself or gained a level is transferred to a separate pool, where it no longer counts toward advancement. Some experience is recovered from this pool, as a bonus, each time the character subsequently earns new experience, until all XP lost from the death is recouped.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchy_Online_6871.html" title="Edit section: Leets">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Leets</span></h3>
<p>A "Leet" is a furry, cuddly creature resembling a <a href="../../../r/o/d/Rodent.html" title="Rodent">rodent</a>. Living up to their name, leets speak in <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leet.html" title="Leet">leet</a> speak and have a strong following of players. The names of the various kinds of leets found in the game world plays on the term, with progressively stronger leets named Eleet, Leetas, Soleet, Phear Leet and Supa Leet, in addition to special unique leets named Joo, Ownz and brb. Their cuteness has in many ways made them a mascot for the game, with calls for plush leet dolls being common, and stories such as the <a href="http://arcanum.aodevs.com/humor_leetville.html" class="external text" title="http://arcanum.aodevs.com/humor_leetville.html" rel="nofollow">Leetville</a> series being made. Additional variations of leets have appeared in the game during special events such as Halloween or Christmas. Players are able to transform into a leet through the use of an ironically-named nanoprogram called "Pronouncement of Greatness."</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchy_Online_6871.html" title="Edit section: Cost of Play">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Cost of Play</span></h2>
<p>The subscription cost of Anarchy Online is approximately 14.95USD a month if paying monthly, or 9.95USD a month if paid a year in advance. The core game plus the first expansion is freely downloadable. Other expansions must be purchased, though free trials are available via the Anarchy Online website.</p>
<p><a name="Free_Play_Program" id="Free_Play_Program"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchy_Online_6871.html" title="Edit section: Free Play Program">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Free Play Program</span></h3>
<p>Since December 15, 2004, Funcom has run a promotion allowing players to download and play the core game, plus the Notum Wars expansion since October 27, 2006, entirely free of any charges. This program is currently scheduled to end on January 15, 2008 <a href="http://www.funcom.com/wsp/funcom/frontend.cgi?func=publish.show&amp;func_id=1160&amp;table=CONTENT&amp;item=1004" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.funcom.com/wsp/funcom/frontend.cgi?func=publish.show&amp;func_id=1160&amp;table=CONTENT&amp;item=1004" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, though it has historically been extended past previous deadlines. Players using free accounts are subject to billboards featuring real-world advertisements. Paying customers are able to remove these advertisements or replace them with ones for fictitious game-world products. Free players wishing to use the content available in any other expansion would need to purchase that expansion, after which monthly subscription fees would begin.</p>
<p>The slang term for free account users is "froob" (or "fr00b"), a <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portmanteau.html" title="Portmanteau">portmanteau</a> of "free" and "<a href="../../../n/o/o/Noob.html" title="Noob">noob</a>". Although the term "noob" is normally pejorative, and although many free players are no longer new to the game, the term has remained in common use with both positive and negative connotations depending on the speaker. Funcom has even incorporated it into the game as a t-shirt slogan.</p>

<p>Anarchy Online received its first major upgrade, labeled a "booster pack" by Funcom, in late November 2002. It has since been packaged with the core game. This expansion introduced one of the major components of the game's PvP system, the towers. In this expansion, players and their organizations (AO's name for <a href="../../../p/l/a/Player_guild.html" title="Player guild">player guilds</a>) became capable of building towers on specific land areas across Rubi-Ka. These towers include a central controller and an array of defensive towers, which typically confer bonuses to individual players or their organizations, or which confer penalties on invading players. These towers would regularly become open to attack by players of opposing factions, who, after successfully destroying the towers of their enemy, could claim the land as their own.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchy_Online_6871.html" title="Edit section: The Shadowlands">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Shadowlands</span></h3>
<p>Perhaps the most well received of Anarchy Online's expansions, the Shadowlands presented a tremendous new world, collectively called the Shadowlands, which is the last remnant of the world Rubi-Ka was before it was wrenched apart in the game's fiction by a dimension-breaking cataclysm in ages past. Enriched in notum, this diverse world is inhabited by vestiges of the ancient races that lived on Rubi-Ka, called the Redeemed and the Unredeemed, as well as a giant, world-reaching computer, named Ergo, who recognizes character races as descendants of the past and whose motives in propelling players through the Shadowlands are ambiguous at best.</p>
<p>Released in September of 2003, the Shadowlands expansion was well-received critically, though there were concerns that it had too strong a fantasy bent to mesh completely with the AO universe.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> In addition to the tremendous world the expansion added, it also introduced significant changes, improvements and additions to virtually every aspect of the game, including music, character development, items and interface.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchy_Online_6871.html" title="Edit section: Alien Invasion">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Alien Invasion</span></h3>
<p>Building on the storyline introduced in The Shadowlands, Alien Invasion was the next expansion to the Anarchy Online game. This expansion introduced player-built cities, player-owned shops, new social interactions and clothing, and, most significantly, a new threat to the world of Rubi-Ka in the form of an alien race that has suffered tremendous pain and death because of human interference in the Shadowlands. It was released in September, 2004.</p>

<p>Lost Eden is the title of Anarchy Online's fourth expansion pack. The expansion was released in mid-December of 2006. The expansion focuses on PvP elements and adds a variety of new features, including player-controlled robotic vehicles, additional PvP arenas and attacks, additional items that could only be acquired by spending points awarded for winning PvP conflicts, and the option of dedicating experience towards gaining new abilities rather than levels.</p>
