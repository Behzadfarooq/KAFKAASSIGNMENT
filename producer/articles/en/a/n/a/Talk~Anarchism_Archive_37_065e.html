<p>I don't think that the line "most christian anarchists are vegan or vegetarian" should be included, certainly not without some sort of explanation.

<dd>Agreed, many anarchists are vegan/vegetarian regardless of being Christians.

<p>Not sure if this is how I comment but the above tables are very flawed in that anarcho capitalism is not a widely know variant of anarchism.

<dd>I've done a speaking tour of Italy and know many Italian anarchists, I've never even heard them mention any anarcho capitalist organisation or even individual there. Anyway the point is that this table suggest 4 majoor anarchist divisions with this so called anarchist capitalism as one of them. But anarchist capitalism isn't any sort of major division - its almost unknown. It would be like a table or world religions that consisted of Islam, Hinduism, Christianity and 7th day adventism. The purpose of such a table would clearly be to suggest that 7th day adventism was something it is not - a major religious division.</dd>

<p>Big in Italy? Sure. The actual anarchist movement in Italy is extremely large, with functioning federations, weekly newspaper and so on. I've never heard of "anarcho"-capitalists outside of the US and a handful of people in the UK. Maybe it's big in comparison to the UK, i.e. two Handfuls of people?</p>
<p>As it stands, I have to object to the notion that anarcho-communists aim to "prohibit" wage labor. read kropotkin's conquest of bread, for example, when he discusses why an anarchist society has nothing to fear from a capitalist trying to set up shop there. And I should also note that the same work also indicates that anarcho-communism has no problem with workers and farmers owning and using their own tools and land.</p>
<p>A handful in the UK? I LIVE in the UK, and have never heard of it until I came on wikipedia. Heh. As for your thoughts, the reason why the chart is full of inaccuracies is because all I did was patch the various information from this article, since I'm not an expert on this. And you have pointed out it's inaccurate, so please could you help improve it? Thanks ^^ The chart can be edited here: Template:Anarchism table <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfinity0_7a16.html" title="User:Infinity0">Infinity0</a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/f/User_talk%7EInfinity0_df0a.html" title="User talk:Infinity0">talk</a></sup> 23:32, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I had never heard of "anarcho"-capitalism, either before I went on-line. They really do not exist within the anarchist movement. Outside of America (or on-line), there are hardly any. Whenever I mention them to other anarchists, they have no idea how anyone could call themselves an anarchist and a capitalist. I've never meet an anarchist who could consider them as anarchists. Anyway, I've made the changes to the table -- I replaced prohibited by "abolished" as this reflects the real situation better. Hope that helps. [[User: BlackFlag] 08:55, February 24/02/2006</dd>

<dd>But why fiddle with a table whose whole design seems intended to misrepresent the various schools of anarchism. It doesn't belong on this page (I guess it could go on the anarcho capitalism one</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bad Intro</span></h2>
<p>The intro says "Anarchism originated as a term of abuse first used against early working class radicals including the Diggers of the English Revolution and the sans-culottes of the French Revolution.[1]" But note 1 says absolutely nothing about the first use of "anarchism." It's a erroneous note, so I'll delete it again.A citation has been requested but not supplied since (Revision as of 22:05, 18 February 2006) if not longer.</p>

<p>First of all, your source says "anarchist" - not "anarchism" - was first used in the 1790s French revolution. Secondly, I've seen a citation of "anarchist" being used much earlier in England. If I provide the sourse for this, will you quit reverting?</p>

<dd>There it is! (Duh.) Later in the article! "In the modern era, the first to use the term to mean something other than chaos was Louis-Armand, Baron de Lahontan in his Nouveaux voyages dans l'Amérique septentrionale, (1703), where he described the indigenous American society, which had no state, laws, prisons, priests, or private property, as being in anarchy[9]."

<dd>That is a rather interesting piece of information. But was the word anarchism used, or just anarchy? <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 21:26, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the point above is very germain. Lahontan is basically describing a society where no state has emerged, as opposed to apolitical movement which seeks to abolish the state using the evidence of non-state societies as evidence of the practicality of this.<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarrypotter_9204.html" title="User:Harrypotter">Harrypotter</a> 22:19, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This user even pointed out (in a comment reverted due to page pollution) that Webster dates the word "anarchism" to 1642. This appears consistent with saying it was developed in retaliation to the Diggers (who formed in 1639). However, I'm unsure if saying "first used against early working class radicals including the Diggers of the English Revolution and the sans-culottes of the French Revolution" is a good idea as we're talking 150 years of difference as if its irrelevant. Maybe we should say it was first used against the Diggers and then mention the sans-culottes as a resurgence of the term? <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 22:49, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The two uses may have developed separately.

<dd>I'd be interested in seeing Webster's citation. On the <a href="../../../d/i/g/Diggers_%28True_Levellers%29_b093.html" title="Diggers (True Levellers)">Diggers</a> page it says they were founded in <a href="../../../1/6/4/1649.html" title="1649">1649</a>. I've checked on line and found nothing supporting this notion, although 1642 does seem to play a role in an-cap hagiography! So I would like to see the 1642 quote, before changing anything. (I have studied some of the pamphlets of the civil war collected in both the British library and the Guildhall Library (London), but never came across such a citation.<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarrypotter_9204.html" title="User:Harrypotter">Harrypotter</a> 23:20, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hmm. I see that the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Civil_War_6bfe.html" title="English Civil War">English Civil War</a> began in 1642. Perhaps the term was used against individuals similar to the Diggers before that group was formally organized? Or perhaps the date is just messed up or sloppy. Also, I noticed that Britannica says that during the French Revolution, the <a href="../../../e/n/r/Enrag%C3%A9s.html" title="Enragés">Enragés</a> were criticized as being "advocates of anarchy" <a href="http://www.wip.britannica.com/ebc/article-9117285" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wip.britannica.com/ebc/article-9117285" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 00:31, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sounds good. It's not a period of history I know anything about, but it's something that needs to be clarified.

<dd>The voluminous full edition cites first recorded written use of the word and I only have access to it in the public library. I feel that the pocket version might well be correct, but lets see. ACtually, I am drawn to setting up different pages for anarchy, anarchist and anarchism, but it would be good to know what others think. I am mindful of the political use of the term anarchy to describe unregulated markets by socialists and also <a href="../../../w/2E/e/W.E.B._DuBois_289a.html" title="W.E.B. DuBois">W.E.B.

<dd>I've heard Rage Against the Machine referred to as anarchist, but I wouldn't call them overall notable as a cultural aspect of anarchism. Also I'd kind of rather we avoided listing musicians here, since we already talk about anarchism and music later on.

<dd>They have had a lot of influence on anarchism though, especially the situationists, so I think they should be put back in. The situationist page mentions anarchism quite a bit, so I think they especially should be mentioned. And heck, if we can put anarcho-capitalism in the page, we can definitely put the SI. The autonomist marxism page also mentions anarchists as being important in some areas, especially in the Autonomist movements (w/o the further Marxist distinction). Therefore I am readding them in, but will mention that they weren't explicitly anarchist. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force">The Ungovernable Force</a> 19:27, 12 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Both groups are libertarian socialists (of the Marxist school). They are not anarchists, but close to anarchism. There is significant overlap in ideas (and Lenin called the council communists anarchists). They should be mentioned, particularly as the situationists have had a major impact in post-war anarchist thinking. I would say they have more right to be mentioned in an anarchist entry than "anarcho"-capitalism. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackFlag_0a78.html" title="User:BlackFlag">BlackFlag</a> 14:54, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You think someone'd hit on the most obvious point eventually. Government and state aren't the same thing. Government essentially means the administrative body of an organization, regardless of whether that organization is a state, a corporation, or whatever. The typical definition of anarchism as opposing "<i>all forms</i> of government" makes it clear that it's not just talking about the state, but about creation and enforcement of rules in general, which all anarcho-capitalists believe in. They want to kill the state but leave the rules, the government, intact. Anarcho-capitalists seem to treat the terms state and government as the same thing, and so take the definition of anarchism as given by most sources to mean an opposition to the state. But they're very clearly wrong. Most definitions of government don't even mention the word "state" in passing. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 00:23, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Anarchism, Racism and Nationalism" section</span></h2>
<p>How does this section relate to anarchism as a philosophy? Meaning how do nationalism and racism fit into anarchist theory? At present, it only describes anarchists that have expressed support for racism or nationalism. However, this page is (or rather, should be) about anarchism, rather than anarchists. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 23:17, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It doesn't. Fine to have some mention of this in the criticisms section, which can then link to the criticisms page which needs to get started. But a section like this over-represents the role of nationalism in anarchism as a philosophy and a movement. Harry, wouldn't you accept that:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>a) anarchism intersects with nationalism and racism (in the sense that particular anarchists have been nationalists) no more than any other political tendency - socialism, liberalism, whatever you like ... Devoting a section to anarchism and nationalism suggests there is a particular and strong link.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>b) in fact anarchists have been amongst the most outspoken critics of nationalism.

<dd>Ok, upon further inspection I am just going to blank that section. There is already an area in the criticism section for hypocricy, so this stuff should go there (and some of it is). Furthermore, I would like to see sources of some of those things before putting them back in (especially the one on John Zerzan). Hakim Bey doesn't surprise me, I knew about Proudhon, the Zapatistas aren't anarchists <i>per se</i> (though they have many anarchist tendencies) so the criticism doesn't matter that much. I will add some stuff about national "anarchism" to the hypocricy section now though, because that is all well known. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force">The Ungovernable Force</a> 06:53, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nationalism in anarchism isn't necessarily hypocritical. Eg. Proudhon, I don't think he ever claimed to have universalist or internationalist ideas, so it wasn't hypocritical of him to be a racist.

<dd>None of the academic writings (mainly encyclopedia sections) I've seen on anarchism have ever mentioned nationalism. I am not saying it doens't exist, I know it did, especially among some of the earlier theorists (like Proudhon, which is partially why I don't read a lot of the early theorists). I like the idea of creating a page on anarchism and nationalism so that the issue can be discussed fully from both sides. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force">The Ungovernable Force</a> 19:30, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just to put in my two cents, I wouldn't consider nationalism and anarchism incompatible necessarily, although I would racism and anarchism. How I see it, government, state, and nation are all clearly distinct. Government refers to policymaking processes, nation refers to national identity, and state refers to a fixed system of borders. Just the idea of anarchist societies say, waving a different flag from one another doesn't seem necessarily incompatible with anarchism. However, "racism" as a term means categorizing people into groups based on perceived physical appearance and ranking them hierarchically, and the idea of segregating people based on this perception seems terribly counterintuitive to the ideals of anarchism. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 20:23, 18 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>True, but all too often nationalism is nothing more than a guise for jinogism, racism and divisive thinking, so it should be undermined. Plus most people think of it in terms of the nation-<i>state</i> which is definetely something we shouldn't want (btw, I've never heard your definition of state, but I could be wrong). <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force">The Ungovernable Force</a> 20:32, 18 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well sure, a lot of ugly things are attached to it rather effortless. And actually, that was a sloppy definition of state. I guess I mean it's more of a legal jurisdiction in which a powerful body "successfully claims the monopoly of the use of force". I was only trying to say it doesn't necessarily coincide with a nation. For instance, in the old German model, the nation and the state didn't overlap. The state was merely a legal border and the "nation" extended out past this border into Austro-Hungary, etc. Today almost all states are nationstates, so people tend to see the two terms as interrelated. Nor does it coincide with government, because a state doesn't necessarily need to create policy. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 20:49, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am not adept with this editing system. I meant to revise your reference because the General Idea of the Revolution is by Proudhon, not Kropotkin, and the passages you cite, other than the one from the Conquest of Bread, are by Proudhon, who was not an anarchist communist. Unfortunately, when I tried editing your citations I messed everything up, including the correct citation to The Conquest of Bread. My apologies.</p>
<p>As for texts where Kropotkin advocates distribution of wealth according to need, they are numerous. This is the overriding theme of The Conquest of Bread, and also Kropotkin's pamphlet, "Anarchist Communism" (1887). Kropotkin advocated the abolition of capitalism and individual ownership of property, hence my reference to abolition of private property, which comes to the same thing and does not imply collective ownership, in contrast to the previous passage which referred, incorrectly, to Kropotkin advocating workers' control and ownership of the means of production.</p>

<p>I see that you have now reinserted your incorrect citations to the General Idea of the Revolution, still incorrectly referring to this work as something by Kropotkin. That is just wrong. In my view, the citation must be removed because it sets forth Proudhon's mutualist ideas, not Kropotkin's anarchist communist ideas. Lastly, Kropotkin did not advocate "workers" control and possession of the means of production. He advocated voluntary association and was concerned that the syndicalist approach would create a syndicalist government under the guise of "workers' control." See in particular, "Anarchism: Its Philosophy and Ideal," and Modern Science and Anarchism, as well as his introduction to the syndicalist utopia, How We Shall Bring About the Revolution, by Pataud and Pouget.</p>

<dd>OK, I've removed the "worker controlled MOP", since you know more about this than I do.

</dl>
<p>Here are some Kropotkin quotes on distribution according to need:</p>
<p>From The Conquest of Bread (Cambridge UP 1995 edition):</p>
<p>"We must take possession, in the name of the people, of the granaries, the shops full of clothing, and the dwelling houses... We must organize without delay to feed the hungry, to satisfy all wants, to meet all needs, to produce not for the special benefit of this one or that one, but so as to ensure to society as a whole its life and further development." (p. 29)</p>
<p>"... the rural township still struggles to preserve the last traces of this communism and it succeeds--except when the state throws its heavy sword into the balance. Meanwhile new organizations, based on the same principle--to every man according to his needs--spring up under a thousand different forms; for without a certain leaven of communism the present societies could not exist. In spite of the narrowly egoistic turn given to men's minds by the commercial system, the tendency towards communism is constantly appearing, and it influences our activities in a variety of ways." (p. 33)</p>
<p>"In a word, the system is this: no stint or limit to what the community possesses in abundance, but equal sharing and dividing of those commodities which are scarce or apt to run short." (p. 62)</p>
<p>"The question of clothing will of course demand consideration... The only possible solution will be to take possession, in the name of the people, of all the shops and warehouses where clothing is sold or stored, and to throw open the doors to all, so that each can take what he needs. The communalization of clothing--the right of each to take what he needs from the communal stores, or to have it made for him at the tailors and outfitters--is a necessary corollary of the communalization of houses and food." (p. 84)</p>
<p>"Thus, after having denied communism, after having laughed at their ease at the formula--'to each according to his needs'--these great economists discover that they have forgotten something, the needs of the producers..." (p. 156)</p>
<p>"... if the needs of the individual are taken as the starting-point of our political economy, we cannot fail to reach communism, an organization which enables us to satisfy all needs in the most thorough and economic way." (p. 163)</p>
<p>From Anarchist Communism (Revolutionary Pamphlets, Dover edition, 1970):</p>
<p>"Common possession of the necessaries for production implies the common enjoyment of the fruits of the common production... when everybody, contributing for the common wellbeing to the full extent of his capacities shall enjoy also from the common stock of society to the fullest possible extent of his needs." (p. 59)</p>
<p>On the role of voluntary association, Kropotkin's article from the Encyclopedia Britannica (11th ed, 1905) says this:</p>
<p>In an anarchist society, "the voluntary associations which already now begin to cover all the fields of human activity would take a still greater extension so as to substitute themselves for the state in all its functions. They would represent an interwoven network, composed of an infinite variety of groups and federations of all sizes and degrees, local, regional, national and international--temporary or more or less permanent--for all possible purposes: production, consumption and exchange, communications, sanitary arrangements, education, mutual protection, defence of the territory, and so on..."</p>
<p>When Kropotkin talks about the people taking possession of the existing means of production he is referring to this process of voluntary associations replacing both government functions and private control of the means of production. However, the voluntary associations "possess" the various means of production for the purpose of producing sufficient goods so that each person may freely satisfy his or her needs from the fruits of that production. This is different from Proudhon's concept of possession, by which he meant everyone should be entitled to the fruits of his or her own labour, to retain either for personal consumption or to exchange with others for other commodities.</p>

That's a mainstream source showing that under *current* word usage, Spooner supported capitalism, even if he opposed it when it meant something different during his time.

<dd>False. For anti-capitalists, employment is usually non-consensual, but not necessarily (e.g., if full value of labor is paid, system non-coercive, etc.). Ancaps would "oppose" a specific instance of "employment" too if they were given specific evidence that it were based on specific coercive acts; they just don't throw a blanket ban on all cases. Even Kevin Carson holds that employment can be voluntary.

<dd>Sarge, I'm not saying this as an insult. I'm saying this because discussing anything with you is extremely frustrating. You <i>really</i> need to work on your attention span. The response I'm about to give to your question, I've already given several times already. The response goes as follows and begins now: The modern usage of the term "capitalism" diverges sharply from that of late 19th century. All dictionaries confirm this. The WSJ link is special in that it shows a mainstream source using the mainstream definition of capitalism, and <i>specfically</i>, unambiguously mentioning that Spooner meets it. This is solid evidence of actual usage of a term. If the term "capitalism" were used incorrectly, it would not have made it past one of the most widely respected editorial boards in English-language daily publications.

<dd>I'm actually rather proud of my short attention span. But you're still assuming that a) the editors of Wall Street Journal have actually read Lysander Spooner and have a good sense of his economic theory b) they consider it a detail important enough to criticize in a commentary piece attributed to a third party rather than the newspaper itself. A lot of newspapers don't even bother to analyze editorial pieces at all, and edit them only out of space concerns. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 02:00, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What nonsense. So someone in a paper called Spooner a capitalist? I read someone in a newspaper call Ayn Rand an "anarcho-capitalist." Doesn't make it so, though. I loved this, though: "The free market *is* capitalism, under present usage." The present usage is that our current economic system is capitalism. Does that mean that "anarcho"-capitalists are now in favour of "actually existing" capitalism? Logically, they must be if we apply the "present usage" argument... As for Spooner, he repeatedly argued that he thought his system would end wage labour -- nearly everyone would be their own boss. Any socialist will tell you such a system is not capitalist, it is pre-capitalist as the free market does not equal capitalism. But, then again, the actual opinions of people like Spooner seem not to matter to "anarcho"-capitalists. Which is strange, given how much they try and appropriate their legacy. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackFlag_0a78.html" title="User:BlackFlag">BlackFlag</a> 10.32 20, March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First, kid, it was not "someone in a paper", it was an essay in a mainstream publication that uses the <i>normal</i>, common, everyday usages of words. It doesn't matter what Spooner thinks would emerge. Even if he were right, the *mainstream" description of such a system would be "capitalism".

<dd>"kid"? Always nice to start with an insult -- always shows the weakness of an argument. Okay, so the "normal", "common", "everyday" usage of words is what we are using? Okay, then "anarchy" stands for chaos and disorder. Capitalism means the current economic system. This means, by common usage, "anarcho"-capitalists are supporters of the current corporate system who want disorder and chaos. I'm happy to see that added to the definition of "anarcho"-capitalism. Are you? If not, why not? Common usage must be applied in all cases, surely? As for it not mattering what Spooner thought, but, sorry, you are joking? Spooner's own ideas of what he wanted are irrelevant? I suppose this says it all about "anarcho"-capitalism. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackFlag_0a78.html" title="User:BlackFlag">BlackFlag</a> 09:15, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dt>What does it Mean?&#160;</dt>
<dd>An economic system based on a free market, open competition, profit motive and private ownership of the means of production. Capitalism encourages private investment and business, compared to a government-controlled economy. Investors in these private companies (i.e. shareholders) also own the firms and are known as capitalists.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Investopedia Says...&#160;</dt>
<dd>In such a system, individuals and firms have the right to own and use wealth to earn income and to sell and purchase labor for wages with little or no government control. The function of regulating the economy is then achieved mainly through the operation of market forces where prices and profit dictate where and how resources are used and allocated. The U.S. is a capitalistic system.</dd>

<p>The WSJ article contains errors of fact significant enough to disqualify it as a reputable source on anarchist history. The comments about "the killing of eight Chicago police officers by anarchists in the 1886 Haymarket Riot," for example, show a very sloppy, biased understanding of the actual events. The identity of the bomber is still unknown, and the men executed were not, in fact, tried for the murders, but for their beliefs. It seems more than a bit naive to think that a movie review that dabbles rather unsuccessfully in history provides some authoritative statement about Spooner and capitalism. Spooner's American Letter Mail Company has been subject to specific historical work. If it could be shown that it operated in a way that was <b>entirely compatible</b> with modern definitions of "capitalism," perhaps we would need to open this debate once again. Lacking that, Spooner's economic thought seems to have been pretty well analyzed. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 19:59, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would agree. It is extremely inaccurate on the Haymarket events, not to mention Sacco and Vanzetti (presumably we must now reference this article to show that they were guility after all?). The idea that Marxists praised Proudhon, Bakunin and Kropotkin is a joke. As for capitalism equalling the "free market", well, Tucker would disagree for a start. But I suppose he was a "fringe socialist" and does not count. What about Marx? He also indicated a difference between a free market and capitalism, noting that the former can exist without the latter. Perhaps he is too "fringe" as well? But I always get the impression that "anarcho"-capitalists analyse words rather than concepts -- when it suits them, of course. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackFlag_0a78.html" title="User:BlackFlag">BlackFlag</a> 02:26, 21 March 2006 (UTC)
