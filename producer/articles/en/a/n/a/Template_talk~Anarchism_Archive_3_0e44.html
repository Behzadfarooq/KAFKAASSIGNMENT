<p>With the "Real poll" being open for a week (that poll is now archived), I went ahead and implemented the white design based on the consensus that had developed. As most were indifferent to the border and actual border-related opinions balanced out equally (one for, one against), I took a touch of artistic license and went ahead and added it.</p>

<dd>I agree; this needs to be hashed out. As does the anarcho-capitalism issue. I think the new content is an improvement over the current template in that it makes a compromise on ancap (no disclaimer/no association), and it includes a few new hot topics in contemporary anarchism. I think there are two proper ways to go about organizing this information: Historical/Sociological or Theoretical/Philosophical. The first would organize based on which movements evolved from which while the second would organize based on the conceptual similarities between the different categories. --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 19:17, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Anarcho-capitalism can't be in the "Offshoots" section since more than enough scholars say that it's a form of anarchism and those who deny that it also deny that it came from anarchist tradition - so who actually claims that AC is an offshoot of anarchism? Further, why is <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-primitivism.html" title="Anarcho-primitivism">anarcho-primitivism</a> in that section? Judging by its article, nobody is denying that it's a form of anarchism. Section "Historical approaches" also looks like an OR to me. What the "historical approaches" should mean? As for associated concepts, they are too numerous to be in a template. They might be added in "Relevant lists" in form of a special article. <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVision_Thing_6e8a.html" title="User:Vision Thing">-- Vision Thing --</a> 20:20, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<p>Those who deny that anarcho-capitalism is not a form of anarchism do not necessarily deny that it was inspired by anarchism or came from anarchist tradition; moreover, hardly more than enough scholars say that it <i>is</i> a form of anarchism. It has also not been shown that anarcho-capitalism exists outside of the Internet. There are anarcho-capitalists, of course, but do they ever take their philosophy from their web sites and blogs and do something with it? How has anarcho-capitalism affected history? How has it changed politics? How has it changed philosophy? Perhaps the solution is to not have any divisions and simply list everything either chronologically or alphabetically, but I doubt it. --AaronS 01:16, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia is based on verifiability, can someone provide sources that anarcho-capitalism is an offshoot (defined as "a natural consequence of development") of anarchism and at the same time not a form of anarchism? As for sources for claim that anarcho-capitalism is a form of anarchism, I can provide a dozen of them. Further, anarcho-capitalism is an individualist philosophy and individualists, in general, are not very eager to join a mass-movements or organizations. Their self-reliance and independence from collective are characteristics that make them individualists. Idea that someone needs to be a party member to be taken into consideration is a collectivist bias. <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVision_Thing_6e8a.html" title="User:Vision Thing">-- Vision Thing --</a> 11:39, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If 99% of sources would say that anarchism is chaos and destruction than the article about <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">Anarchism</a> would need to be about chaos and destruction, and <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_%28philosophy%29.html" title="Anarchism (philosophy)">Anarchism (philosophy)</a> about political philosophy.<a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVision_Thing_6e8a.html" title="User:Vision Thing">-- Vision Thing --</a> 20:10, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It would be better to talk about movements which have a name, like <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provo.html" title="Provo">Provo</a>.

<dl>
<dd>I'm really confused. First---anarchism has a name, it's called anarchism. Socialism is called socialism. Second---you clearly have a different definition of "movement" from mine. In my understanding (and everywhere else I've seen), both socialism and anarchism are political movements, philosophical movements, and social movements. I doubt you could find many sources that contradict this. Anarchism is also a minor <i>cultural</i> movement and socialism is a <i>major</i> cultural movement. Each consists of a large number of sub-movements, both internal and offshoots and each is a member of a number of larger movements, including libertarianism and Enlightenment philosophy. Even just looking on Wikipedia, we can see...
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_movement.html" title="Political movement">Political movement</a> says: "Classic examples include abolitionism, anarchism, the women's suffrage, the Labour movement, universal suffrage movements and anticolonialist movements."</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_movement.html" title="Social movement">Social movement</a> says: "Social movements are a type of group action. They are large informal groupings of individuals and/or organizations focused on specific political or social issues, in other words, on carrying out, resisting or undoing a social change."</li>
<li><a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophical_movement.html" title="Philosophical movement">Philosophical movement</a> says: "What makes a movement identifiable and interesting as distinct from a specific theory is simply that a movement consists in a large flourishing of intellectual work on one or more ideas, in a fairly specifiable time and place."</li>
<li><a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_movement.html" title="Cultural movement">Cultural movement</a> says: "A cultural movement is a change in the way a number of different disciplines approach their work."</li>

<dd>This is just an abstraction made in those articles. If you look at <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Definitions_of_anarchism" class="extiw" title="wikiquote:Definitions_of_anarchism">Wikiquote:Definitions of anarchism</a>, you see that basically call it a doctrine.

I could even call <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservatism.html" title="Conservatism">conservatism</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberalism.html" title="Liberalism">liberalism</a> a political movement with some imagination, this does not help the category hierarchy.

<dl>
<dd>I'm still lost. None of the definitions on that page contradict my statement, and three of them explicitly label anarchism as a movement...I'm baffled by your reluctance to call anarchism and socialism movements. I really am. Just read the page <b>you</b> posted----
<ul>
<li>MS Encarta Encyclopedia (UK version by Carl Levy):<a href="http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568770/Anarchism.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568770/Anarchism.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> "...political concept and social movement that advocates the abolition of any form of State, which is regarded as coercive, and its replacement with voluntary organization"</li>

</dd>
<dd><i>Of course</i> liberalism and conservatism are movements...in all of the senses above. This is trivial and universal. I can't believe you're arguing this, Intangible. If the definitions I've given are not enough, then tell me what is <i>your</i> definition of "movement"? Just tell me what you mean, because what you're saying is extremely confusing. <a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 17:35, 10 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There were of course more definitions at that page...Anyways, for me, for something to be a political movement, there needs to be a historic naming (such as "<a href="../../../p/r/o/Provo.html" title="Provo">Provo</a>") that separates people from other people. Although you probably would claim that anarchism would create such a separation, I beg to differ, there are certainly anarchists who have not been part of a movement. Come to mind, most individualist anarchists were certainly not, since they did not take part in any collective activism. Intangible 23:24, 10 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>And, of course all of those other definitions fall well within the boundaries of one or more of the definitions of "movement" that I supplied several posts ago. Taking part in collective action (according to the Wikipedia article) is part of the definition of a <i>social</i> movement. At least some individualists were certainly part of the anarchist <i>social</i> movement. However, <i>all</i> individualists were part of the anarchist <i>philosophical</i> movement because they interacted with and based their theories on one another. While anarcho-capitalism certainly is a philisophical movement in its own right, but I have yet to see any evidence that it is actually based on the traditional anarchist philosophical movement. It certainly is not part of the current or historical anarchist social movement, nor the current anarchist cultural movement. <a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 13:43, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>But, Vision Thing, there are individualists who decidedly have changed philosophy, and who have become internationally known as a result of their application of their philosophy to their life, work, or legacy. Henry David Thoreau, who wrote "the book" on self-reliance, comes to mind; his tax revolt and experiment on Walden Pond are well-known, at least in the United States. From my understanding, individualists are not individualists because they don't like other people or don't like cooperating with others; they're individualists, because they do not want to be <i>forced</i> to do so, and would like to have a choice in the matter. In this regard, individualists and collectivists agree, which is why the individualist-collectivist dichotomy very poorly describes anarchism. All anarchist philosophies are individualist; even the most "collectivist" forms have as their pinnacle goal the complete liberation of the individual. Even Marxism -- the paradigm of collectivism -- has this as its final goal. So, I think that it's a lame excuse to say that anarcho-capitalism is not prevelant in the real world simply because it's an individualist philosophy.</dd>
<dd>You're correct that "offshoot" probably is not the proper term. But anarcho-capitalism is not yet a movement, never has been a movement, and its influence has been mainly restricted to the Internet, Wikipedia included. And when I say "movement," I do not simply mean social movement; I also mean philosophical and political movement. How has anarcho-capitalism changed philosophy? Politics? Society? It is a socio-political philosophy. It must be measured on socio-politico-philosophical grounds.</dd>
<dd>As for its relation to anarchism, it was inspired by anarchism. But anarchists, for the most part, have wholeheartedly rejected it. Consider this (probably very poor) analogy: pretend that the Protestant Reformation is occurring now. Up until this point, the only deal in town for Christianity was Catholicism. Martin Luther posts his theses on the door, and it causes a stir. Protestantism, however, has not yet swept the world; it has, for the most part, yet to leave that door. It is confined to a few circles, and the vast majority of Christians reject it as against their beliefs. If this were happening now, it would be unencyclopaedic for Wikipedia to give undue weight to Martin Luther's theses. Wikipedia would then be acting as a soapbox for Protestantism. Now, this of course is not how the Reformation occurred, and anarchism is not a religion, but I believe that the analogy provides some sense of where some of us, who are trying to be neutral, are coming from. --AaronS 12:54, 8 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You are right about individualist-collectivist dichotomy. However, as for influence of anarcho-capitalism on philosophy, politics and society, it seems that you don't apply the same criteria on anarcho-capitalism as on other recent anarchist movements. What is the influence of green anarchism or post-left anarchy on today's world? <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVision_Thing_6e8a.html" title="User:Vision Thing">-- Vision Thing --</a> 20:10, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>To the anarchists:</b> While I agree that it's obvious that ancaps are not anarchists, I have to point out the fact that we--myself included--have not done our homework here. Vision Thing is acting in good faith, citing sources, doing the footwork. We need to do the same. Vision's sources may be totally naive on the subject of anarchism, but I have seen almost no sources at all from the anarchists here. Come on, we can do better than that. Sure, encyclopedias and dictionaries are always inaccurate about anarchism, but there are anarchist books out there and some of them must have dealt with the issue of anarcho-capitalism. Furthermore, there have been plenty of anarchist periodicals over the years, and these are probably more representative of the movement as a whole. Doesn't somebody have some back issues of Northeastern Anarchist laying around? If we can't resolve this through citing sources, I see no alternative but to split the page into <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_%28movement%29.html" title="Anarchism (movement)">Anarchism (movement)</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_%28philosophy%29.html" title="Anarchism (philosophy)">anarchism (philosophy)</a>, keeping traditional anarchism in the first, and all the new upstarts in the second.</dd>
<dd><b>To the ancaps:</b> Look, the confusion is understandable. It's called anarcho-capitalism, its ostensibly anti-government, even encyclopedias describe it as a type of anarchism. So why shouldn't it be called a type of anarchism on Wikipedia? Good question. Look at it from our viewpoint...imagine a doctor comes to your house one day with a hampster and announces that this is your new daughter. He presents a birth certificate and a blood test, "proving" the hampster to be your very own offspring. Normally, that sort of verification is hard to deny...but it's a <i>hampster</i> for god's sake! The idea that this could be your daughter flies in the face of everything you know about everything. You would insist that the birth certificate is mistaken, if not outright fake, the blood test must have been performed incorrectly. In short, you need a <i>greater</i> standard of evidence for such an unusual claim. The same is true here. All anarchists *except* ancaps know with total certainty that anarchism is anticapitalist and always has been. If you find some encyclopedia that says otherwise, it's obviously wrong. So, you need higher than normal standards of evidence...you need source material. Primary, not secondary. I think if you could find Goldman or Bookchin or somebody to explain exactly how anarcho-capitalism comes out of anarchism proper, or if you could explain in detail how Rothbard supposedly derived his philosophy from anarchism, or if you could find examples of anarchists working with anarcho-capitalists or anarcho-capitalists supporting other anarchists or having *any* sort of contact with the movement other than some tenuous theoretical link, then we'd accept a compromise. But short of that, it sounds like you and Rothbard alike are just making things up and using shoddy sources to back it up. And even in the unlikely event that it turns out to be some fringe sort of anarchism, then that still doesn't make it notable enough to dedicate an entire subheading in the article. --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 13:28, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wikipedia policy prefers secondary, not primary, sources but... For instances that I know of, anarcho-capitalist supported Noam Chomsky - he said (while criticizing anarcho-capitalists philosophy): "I find myself in substantial agreement with people who consider themselves anarcho-capitalists on a whole range of issues; and for some years, was able to write only in their journals." As for tradition, some scholars claim that anarcho-capitalism is a modern version of individualist anarchism, and anarcho-capitalists often see Benjamin Tucker and other individualists as important figures for contemporary ac philosophy. <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVision_Thing_6e8a.html" title="User:Vision Thing">-- Vision Thing --</a> 20:10, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Maybe so but if a source says anarcho-capitalists are individualist anarchists, then they obviously didn't research what they were writing about because the individualists and all other anarchists are anti-capitalist socialists:
<ul>
<li>"...they must sell [their] labor for much less than the amount of wealth it produces. In this way ten, twenty, or a hundred men are literally robbed of an important portion of the fruits of their labor, solely that a single monopolist may be gorged with wealth." --Lysander Spooner, <i>Poverty: Its Illegal Causes and Legal Cures</i></li>
<li>"...the names of the two schools of Socialistic thought [are] State Socialism and Anarchism." --Benjamin Tucker, <i>Individual Liberty</i></li>
<li>"If a treaveller, in a hot day, stop at a farmhouse for a drink of water, he generally gets it without any thought of price. Why? Because it costs nothing, or the cost is immaterial...[t]he water or the wine must posess a value to the reciever...but to make this value or worth the measure of its price constitutes a glaring iniquity of the case, and would class the farmer among the wreckers of Norway, who first sink rocks in order to wreck vessels, and then demand of the crews all their cargoes and vessels for saving their lives...[and] it would class him with flour-dealers and every other huckster of provisions or clothing, with bankers and all other moneymongers and systematic speculators...[t]he only difference between them is that the wrecker must know that he ought to be shot, while the others may suppose that they are following a very 'legitimate business'!" --Josiah Warren</li>

<dd>1) Your quotes prove that individualist anarchist supported labor theory of value, and today's anarcho-capitalists support subjective theory of value. However, labor theory of value is contested by most current economists, and even by some Marxists. Economic theory evolves and it would be self-destructive to support erroneous theories.</dd>
<dd>2) Writers of the <i>An Anarchist FAQ</i> claim that implementation of individualist anarchism would lead to capitalism. Also, by <i>An anarchist FAQ</i>, Kropotkin claimed that Tucker's ideas are "a combination of the <b>anarchist</b> Proudhon's and the liberal <b>capitalist</b> Herbert Spencer's".</dd>
<dd>3) Tucker supported private property and free market claiming that: "Anarchism is a word without meaning, unless it includes the liberty of the individual to control his product or whatever his product has brought him through exchange in a free market - that is, private property. Whoever denies private property is of necessity an Archist." And private property and free market are cornerstones of anarcho-capitalism. <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVision_Thing_6e8a.html" title="User:Vision Thing">-- Vision Thing --</a> 19:33, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What you're missing is that the labor theory of value is a statement of principles...it's saying this is how things <i>ought</i> to work. You know that the subjective theory itself says that there is no intrinsic value of an object...therefore, we are free to put <i>any</i> value on a product we want to, including one that takes labor into account. The individualists used the term <i>free market</i> in a way that is totally incompatable with what capitalists consider a free market. If you read any of their works, you will see that when they say "free market" they are referring to a system that by todays standards would be considered heavily regulated. The thing that made the system "free" to the individualists was that the rules would be enforced by the individual, and not a government. The capitalist version of what constitutes a "free market" was considered totally criminal by the people I quote above. The only reason ancaps think that they are somehow decended from these great thinkers is that ancaps <i>misuse</i> the terms "free market" and "anarchism". You have to read their work to understand what <i>they</i> meant by the words they used. They also had a very different notion of private property than capitalists do--they believed that large accumulations of wealth only happens if the government protects certain businesses, and they believed that their version of the free market would naturally lead to an evening out of wealth among people...that is precisely what makes their writings <i>socialist</i> in nature. As for the right to control the fruits of your labor, most anarchists would agree with this. However, we (including individualists) recognize that capitalism is a system whereby capitalists take the fruits of <i>other peoples'</i> labor. That is theft. If the laborer got all of the profit from their labor, then the capitalist would make no money at all except for getting paid equally for the time s/he put into doing actual work. <a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 19:57, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sure, we are free to put any value on a product we want to, I agree with that. If in anarcho-capitalist system people would end up with roughly (or even absolutely) equal amount of wealth, I wouldn't have anything against that.</dd>
<dd>As for socialism, to the Proudhon, who was a great influence to Tucker, "socialism" meant "co-operative production". Also, to quote lead section in <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a>, "each individual has the right to own the full product of his labor when applied to his own justly acquired property". <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVision_Thing_6e8a.html" title="User:Vision Thing">-- Vision Thing --</a> 19:33, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Um, anarcho-communists don't support taxes, they support a <a href="../../../g/i/f/Gift_economy.html" title="Gift economy">gift economy</a>. Big difference. Your understanding of anarcho-communism seems flawed. As for economic "freedom", how free do you think a person who is born poor can ever be, economically or otherwise? Economic freedom is merely a means for some to advance their self-interest at the expense of others, who lose their freedom. It's the freedom to be able to screw other people over. That's not what I consider freedom. Anarcho-communists advocate freedom for freedom's sake, and for people to be free, they need to have access to the basic needs of life and not forced to bow to the will of an employer. Anarcho-communism is about <b>co-operation</b> and <b>voluntary</b> sharing of resources, as opposed to the ruthless competition of the free market, or the forced "equality" of authoritarian socialism. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><b><font color="black">Ungovernable Force</font></b></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_Wikipedian_kitchen_68b8.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force/Wikipedian kitchen"><font color="green"><sup>The Wiki Kitchen!</sup></font></a> 00:26, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I object to anarcho-capitalism being separated from the other kinds of anarchism. It makes no sense to put it in a section called "Influenced by anarchism." That is POV because it is asserting as truth that it is not anarchism but just influenced by it. It is the mainstream view is that it is a form of anarchism. It is a fringe view that it is not. Wikipedia should not reflect the fringe view from anti-capitalists except maybe in a footnote. We all know that anti-capitalists do not like anarcho-capitalism and say it is not "true anarchism." But what is important is what the consensus of scholarly opinion says, and everything I've seen says it is anarchism. Consider the weight of the evidence. How many sources say it is anarchism and how many say it is not. You will find that the overwhelming majority of scholarly opinion says that it is. <a href="../../../d/t/c/User%7EDTC_5378.html" title="User:DTC">DTC</a> 22:09, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree, I have presented even evidence for this on this talk page (see archives). Only one counter-source was presented, written by a free-lance author for a marginal publishing house, while my sources were from academia, some in refereed journals. I even showed that with the work of <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Jay_Nock_8c54.html" title="Albert Jay Nock">Albert Jay Nock</a>, there is a linkage between the individualist anarchists and anarcho-capitalists. I think qua content, the template I gave ("collectivist" "individualist" "other") is a good compromise, I continue to reject the others. Intangible 22:25, 14 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, we can't let the POV pushers override the weight of the evidence from scholarly sources. By the way, not only is there a link between individualist anarchists and anarcho-capitalist, but anarcho-capitalists are individualist anarchists. No one thinks the're collectivist anarchists. But you probably meant a link between 19th century individualist anarchists. Individualist anarchism is any anarchist philosophy that rejects the authority of the collective over the individual. They can be of the amoral Stirnerite variety, they can be of the anti-profit Tuckerite variety, or they can be of the pro-profit Rothbardian variety. <a href="../../../d/t/c/User%7EDTC_5378.html" title="User:DTC">DTC</a> 22:32, 14 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>All of the "scholarly" sources ancaps have provided are superficial comparisons based on the similarity between terms. If you read any of the individualist anarchist works cited, you can see that all of the individualists were anti-capitalists in the modern sense of the term, and read any anarchist writings and you will see that anarcho-capitalism was rejected from the start. If any old dictionary or encyclopedia entry counts as a source, then we might as well just write an article about how anarchism is about "chaos" and "disorder" and "terrorism". I'm willing to come to a consensus that leaves anarcho-capitalism on the template, but we haven't yet reached a consensus about how it ought to be classified. I am giving you the benefit of the doubt that you are acting in good faith, I would like you to do the same for me. I have also provided ample evidence that there is a difference between the Anarchist movement and various anarchist philosophies and I have suggested a number of compromises that would split the page to make a clear acknowledgement of the proper place of anarcho-capitalism within the philosophical range of anarchism while pointing out its seperateness from the anarchist movement proper. Nobody has yet come up with an adequate rebuttle to that suggestion, nor has any ancap tried to present a compromise. We're working for the same thing here: accuracy and NPOV. Besides, labeling it as "disputed" does not imply that the majority of anarchists are right, it just points out the fact that its place is not clear. <a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 00:27, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think you understand. Your statement that "all of the individualist anarchists were anti-capitalists" is false according to the consensus of scholarly opinion. The anarcho-capitalists *are* individualist anarchists. But that doesn't mean that all individualist anarchists are anarcho-capitalists. An individualist anarchist can be anti-capitalist or pro-capitalist. All of the following sources that say that anarcho-capitalism is a pro-capitalist form of individualist anarchism. They don't just say that it is similar to it, but that it *is* a form of individualist anarchism. Individualist anarchism takes many forms. Anarcho-capitalism is one of those forms: Tormey, Simon. <i>Anti-Capitalism</i>, One World, 2004. - Perlin, Terry M. <i>Contemporary Anarchism</i>, Transaction Books, NJ 1979 - Raico, Ralph. <i>Authentic German Liberalism of the 19th Century</i>, Ecole Polytechnique, Centre de Recherce en Epistemologie Appliquee, UnitÃ© associÃ©e au CNRS, 2004. - Heider, Ulrike. <i>Anarchism:Left, Right, and Green</i>, City Lights, 1994. p. 3. - Outhwaite, William. <i>The Blackwell Dictionary of Modern Social Thought</i>, <i>Anarchism</i> entry, p. 21, 2002. - Bottomore, Tom. <i>Dictionary of Marxist Thought</i>, <i>Anarchism</i> entry, 1991. - Ostergaard, Geofrey. Resisting the Nation State - the anarchist and pacifist tradition, Anarchism As A Tradition of Political Thought. Peace Pedge Union Publications <a href="http://www.ppu.org.uk/e_publications/dd-trad6.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ppu.org.uk/e_publications/dd-trad6.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> - Barry, Norman. Modern Political Theory, 2000, Palgrave, p. 70. Now on your other point you're exactly right. Anarcho-capitalism *is* a philosophical movement, not a social movement. But that also applies to anti-capitalist individualist anarchism. All individualist anarchism is philosophical movement, not a social movement. This source says it explicity: "Anarcho-individualism is at best only a philosophical/literary phenomenon and not a social movement." Skirda, Alexadndre. Facing the Enemy: A History of Anarchist Organization from Proudhon to May 1968, AK Press, 2002, p. 191 Skirda is not talking about anarcho-capitalism but all forms of individualist anarchism. So if by "split the page" you mean that Anarchism page, then you would have to split anti-capitalist individualist anarchism into that category as well. But if you look at the Anarchism article that has already been done. <a href="../../../d/t/c/User%7EDTC_5378.html" title="User:DTC">DTC</a> 02:35, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>A 1889 source already makes a difference beteen bomb throwing anarcho-communists and individual anarchists: "Yet, whatever may be true of their ideals, the methods of reaching them which are advocated and practised by the two anarchistic schools are wholly different. The one expects to attain success through a long process of peaceful evolution culminating in perfect individualism...But the Communistic Anarchists are revolutionists of the most violent sort. They form the extreme left wing of the modern revolutionary movement. They teach materialism and atheism in their most revolting forms. The method which they propose to use for the destruction of society and the institution of the new order is beneath scientific consideration. It is fit only to be dealt with by the police and the courts. It furnishes the strongest possible proof of the necessity of authority and of a government to enforce it. Thus the plots of one body of the anarchists are among the most serious obstacles in the way of society ever being able to assume that form which the other group [the individualist anarchists] desires." <cite style="font-style:normal">Osgood (1889). "Scientific Anarchism". <i><a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_Science_Quarterly_8a2d.html" title="Political Science Quarterly">Political Science Quarterly</a></i> <b>4</b> (1): 1-36.</cite><span class="Z3988" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rft.atitle=Scientific+Anarchism&amp;rft.title=%5B%5BPolitical+Science+Quarterly%5D%5D&amp;rft.jtitle=%5B%5BPolitical+Science+Quarterly%5D%5D&amp;rft.date=1889&amp;rft.volume=4&amp;rft.issue=1&amp;rft.au=Osgood&amp;rft.pages=1-36">&#160;</span></dd>
<dd>Anyways. This source also says "The anarchist is an extreme individualist...He subscribes to the doctrine contained in the opening sentences of the Declaration of Independence. He also claims that men who, like Jefferson and Herbert Spencer, express great jealousy of state control, would, if they were logical and true to their principles, become anarchists and advocate the complete emancipation of society." I can provide sources that say that individual anarchists wanted nothing to do with anarcho-communism. So maybe anti-communism should be the criteria to be used for the template, instead of "anti-capitalism"? Intangible 01:10, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This just demonstrates that communism was already becoming a dirty word. Whatever the individualists thought of the tactics of <i>some</i> (not all) of the other anarchists, they still embraced the same core value of economic and political equality among people. Economic equality is the essence of socialism, so the individualists were socialists. They just thought that this equality would come about through a morality-governed market. Anarcho-capitalism rejected the individualist ideas of equality, so they were not individualist anarchists. This isn't a matter of debate, just look at the market ancaps describe compared to the market individualist anarchists describe. <a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 01:41, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The individualist anarchist believed the free market would bring prosperity to all. The only equality they could find is that of individual sovereignty: "As an anarchist, he [Benjamin Tucker] maintained that even the best of economic systems would become oppresive and obnoxious if it involved the arbitrary distribution of goods according to statute law. He demanded liberty above all, including the liberty for man to control what he produced, as "the surest guarantee of prosperity." The policy of complete non-interferenceâenabling everyone to mind his own business exclusivelyâwould permit wealth to "distribute itself in a free market in accordance with the natural operation of economic law." Such truly free competition would enhance the welfare of society without curbing the initiative and enterprise of the ambitious and the capable." <cite style="font-style:normal">Madison, Charles A.

<dd>Exactly, a person should control what they produce. Capitalism allows business owners to control what the workers produce. Now, if anarcho-capitalism rejects the right of business owners to take profits out of workers' paychecks, then maybe it's form of individualist anarchism. <a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 02:25, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Tucker himself defined anarchism as a type of socialism. I already quoted this: "...the names of the two schools of Socialistic thought [are] State Socialism and Anarchism." --Benjamin Tucker, Individual Liberty. Clearly, anarcho-capitalists are using the terms differently from the individualist anarchists. <a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 02:31, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think anybody argues that Tucker was anti-capitalist. But you don't have to be anti-capitalist to be an individualist anarchist. Numerous sources confirm that. There are anti-capitalist individualist anarchist and pro-capitalist individualist anarchists. There is also Stirnerite individualist anarchism which is opposition to the both anti-capitalist and pro-capitalist individualist anarchists because according to that philosophy, whatever you are able to take is your property. See my message to you above for sources saying that anarcho-capitalism is a capitalist form of individualist anarchism. One thing that could be done for the template is you could split the anarchisms by "social movement" and "philosophical" and put all the individualist forms under "philosophical." You could put mutualism under that too because it's not a social movement. But there would still be the problem with it looking like individualist anarchism is distinct from anarcho-capitalism when anarcho-capitalism is one of the forms of individualist anarchism. Unfortunately the anti-profit individualist anarchism of someone like Lysander Spooner doesn't have an official name. <a href="../../../d/t/c/User%7EDTC_5378.html" title="User:DTC">DTC</a> 02:49, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>First, I commend you on doing your homework. That slew of sources was very interesting. However, I can cite any number of dictionaries that define "anarchism" as chaos and disorder. And in a loose sense of the word, they are accurate. Likewise, anarcho-capitalism is an anarchist philosophy in the loose sense of the word (i.e. "anarcism = anti-government"). These secondary sources may lump anarcho-capitalists in with individualist anarchists, but this is a very superficial treatment that doesn't take into account the words of the primary sources themselves. In Tucker's day, he may not have considered himself an anti-capitalist, but by modern standards he certainly was (see the quotes I posted in Archive 2). He, and the other individualists believed in strict limits on what capitalists could and could not claim as fair profit--this is completely contrary to the modern use of the term capitalism, and particularly the use of the term within anarcho-capitalism. <a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 03:06, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>You're still not absorbing what I'm saying. Yes Tucker was anti-capitalist. And yes anarcho-capitalism is pro-capitalist. But both Tucker's philosophy and Rothbard's philosophy are types of individualist anarchism. Individualist anarchists don't have to agree with each other on anything other than on rejecting the state and collectivism to be individualist anarchists. Being pro or anti capitalism is not what distinguishes individualist anarchism from social anarchism. You can't argue with the sources but have to accept them. They're all right there. Anarcho-capitalism is a one form of individualist anarchism. That is the consensus of scholars. <a href="../../../d/t/c/User%7EDTC_5378.html" title="User:DTC">DTC</a> 03:15, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All sources are not created equal, particularly in such a contentious area. Do I really need to cite all of the sources that say anarchism is chaos? Anarchism is also probably a good place to remember the "Ignore All Rules" rule, since much of anarchist history is recorded not in "official" encyclopedias and dictionaries, but in the literature of the movement itself. The individualists would disagree that "rejection of state" is the only thing that defines an anarchist--just read them; they would have attacked anarcho-capitalism faster than modern anarchists. <a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 03:19, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well how convenient that you want to "ignore all rules" when the rules don't let you push your POV and override sourced material. I'm sorry but I'm not going to ignore the rules but enforce them.

<dd>I know, I hate myself for saying it because I know how it sounds, but in this case, it's appropriate. Or maybe I'm self-deluded. But I'll tell you this much: what I'm arguing for is far from what my actual POV is. By the way, this is not the only area where I think "Ignore All the Rules" makes sense...it also applies in many many cases where reality cannot be boiled down to a few quotes by carefully selected sources. Anyway, even if it were "my" point of view, it is also the point of view of nearly all modern anarchists other than anarcho-capitalists, and from reading thi individualists, it would have been their point of view too. Ancaps are a fringe minority, and anarchism is best defined by people who participate in it. Sorry, but if that's not the case, then the door is open to all sorts of bizarre takes on what constitutes anarchism. That's just the ground reality; the common perception of anarchism (and the anarcho-capitalist perception) is very very different from the historical use of the term within anarchism. <a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 03:38, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Anarchism is definitely not best defined by the people who participate in it. The individualist anarchists have historically denied that anarcho-communism was anarchism because they think the collective is a form of authority over the individual. Would you like me to push that POV and keep anarcho-communism out of the template? Believe me I can find lots of sources from individualist anarchists saying that anarcho-communism is not anarchism. The only way to be objective is to let scholars who study it give their opinion on it. You're obviously too wrapped up in your own POV to be objective. This is what the rules on Wikipedia are for.

This would include many but not all of the individualists, who after all did build anarchist communities. It would not include any group or individual whose sole contribution was theoretical. This would be put in the Anarchism (philosophy) section.

<dd>No, I think those sources are largely uninformed outsiders who carelessly threw anarcho-capitalism in with individualism without carefully studying individualism. A few people who call themselves anti-capitalists, perhaps even a few anti-capitalist anarchists may like to include anarcho-capitalism within anarchism, again based on superficial understanding of the terms.

<dd>That's not the case at all. Those sources acknowledge that the individualist anarchism of Benjamin Tucker was anti-capitalist. They're are not saying Benjamin Tucker was pro-capitalist.

It <i>should</i> be on the template because it is associated with anarchism, but grouping it closely with the other branches of anarchism will confuse people into thinking that they are a closely related philosophy. <a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 03:48, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Anarcho-capitalism is anarchism. It is a fringe view if any among scholars that it's not. OF COURSE anarcho-communists don't think it's real anarchism. But anarcho-communists that are not published scholars have no say in the matter. They are speaking from a non-reliable POV. With all due respect, just like you. You hate capitalism so therefore you're going to say anarcho-capitalism is not true anarchism. And your not a respected scholar on political philosophy. In other words, with all due respect, you don't know what you're talking about. I'm not saying I do, but I am going to defer to the scholars.

<p>From Political Ideology Today: "Benjamin R. Tucker (1854-1939) was the leading American anarchist of the late nineteenth century. Like Warren, he also saw his ideas as socialistic, although he was much more committed to the free market, and even believed his socialistic anarchism to be consistent with classical liberalism." Clearly if the socialism of Tucker is consistent with liberalism, this is not socialism in the ordinary sense of the meaning. Even anarcho-capitalism would be a form of socialism with Tucker's notion. Intangible 18:27, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

   A common source of obstinacy in NPOV disputes is the belief that one group "owns" a word and has     
   sole authority to define it:
   
   "The word liberalism was coined by political philosophers. Political philosophers are the experts  
   on liberalism, and not one of them alive today believes that liberalism is the same thing as 
   libertarianism."
   
   In fact, many words have multiple meanings, and it's not just that one person sometimes uses 
   "liberal" to refer to a political movement and sometimes to refer to generous use of an 
   ingredient in a recipe. Sometimes it means that different people mean different things when they
   say the same word.

<dd>That is exactly what I mean. Anarcho-capitalists define "anarchism" in a different way. That's fine, they are perfectly within their rights to do so. But as long as we can acknowledge they have a different meaning of the term, then putting them on a page that uses the term differently is misleading and is a violation of NPOV because it implies that they are supporters of the same ideas as other anarchists, which they are not. All I'm saying is that we acknowledge the difference. Anarchists proper and anarcho-capitalists should be on seperate pages. It's simple: they mean one thing, we mean another thing therefore they belong in different articles. It is also in the interests of accuracy to point out that anarcho-capitalists and individualist anarchists use the terms "free market", "anarchism", and "individualism" in very different ways. <a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 01:45, 15 August 2006 (UTC)t's a word.</dd>

But only in a way that does not confuse the two different uses of the term "anarchism" and only in a way that doesn't give undue prominence to a small minority. That's NPOV. However, if we are unwilling to draw a clear distinction between the two uses of the term, then we have to include every other use of the word "anarchism" on the same template as well...so we must include links to "anarcho-monarchism" as well as anarchists as vandals and terrorists and all of the other definitions of the word. My proposal to split the page into Anarchism (movement) and Anarchism (philosophy) is a compromise that clarifies the issue and provides a place for multiple uses of the term "anarchism". <a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 02:06, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>"ANARCHISM (from the Gr. , and , contrary to authority), the name given to a principle or theory of life and conduct under which society is conceived without government - harmony in such a society being obtained, not by submission to law, or by obedience to any authority, but by free agreements concluded between the various groups, territorial and professional, freely constituted for the sake of production and consumption, as also for the satisfaction of the infinite variety of needs and aspirations of a civilized being"</li>
<li>"As to their economical conceptions, the anarchists, in common with all socialists, of whom they constitute the left wing, maintain that the now prevailing system of private ownership in land, and our capitalist production for the sake of profits, represent a monopoly which runs against both the principles of justice and the dictates of utility"</li>

<p><a href="../../../e/m/i/Emile_Armand_f95c.html" title="Emile Armand">Emile Armand</a>: "As the word "anarchy" etymologically signifies the negation of governmental authority, the absence of government, it follows that one indissoluble bond unites the anarchists. This is antagonism to all situations regulated by imposition, constraint, violence, governmental oppression, whether these are a product of all, a group, or of one person. In short, whoever denies that the intervention of government is for human relationships is an anarchist."</p>
<p>William Bailie: "Modern Anarchism...is primarily a tendency - moral, social, and intellectual. As a tendency it questions the supremacy of the State, the infallibility of statute laws, and the divine right of all authority, spiritual or temporal. It is, in truth, a product of Authority, the progeny of the State, a direct consequences of the inadequacy of law and government to fulfill their assumed functions. In short, the Anarchist tendency is a necessity of progress, a protest against usurpation, privilege, and injustice." (<i>The Anarchist Spirit</i>, 1906)</p>

<p>"In a word, we reject all legislation, all authority, and all privileged, licensed, official, and legal influence, even though arising from universal suffrage, convinced that it can turn only to the advantage of a dominant minority of exploiters against the interest of the immense majority in subjection to them. This is the sense in which we are really Anarchists." (<i>God and the State</i>, p. 35)</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Berkman_2d35.html" title="Alexander Berkman">Alexander Berkman</a>: "Anarchism means you should be free; that no one should enslave you, boss you, rob you, or impose upon you. It means you should be free to do the things you want to do; and that you should not be compelled to do what you do not want to do. (...) That is to say, that there should be no war, no violence used by one set of men against another, no monopoly and no poverty, no oppression, no taking advantage of your fellow-man. In short, Anarchism means a condition or society where all men and women are free, and where all enjoy equally the benefits of an ordered and sensible life."</p>
<p><a href="../../../l/2E/_/L._Susan_Brown_36db.html" title="L. Susan Brown">L. Susan Brown</a>: "While the popular understanding of anarchism is of a violent, anti-State movement, anarchism is a much more subtle and nuanced tradition then a simple opposition to government power. Anarchists oppose the idea that power and domination are necessary for society, and instead advocate more co-operative, anti-hierarchical forms of social, political and economic organisation." (<i>The Politics of Individualism</i>, p. 106)</p>
<p><a href="../../../n/o/a/Noam_Chomsky_7341.html" title="Noam Chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a>: "a tendency in the history of human thought and action which seeks to identify coercive, authoritarian, and hierarchic structures of all kinds and to challenge their legitimacy, and if they cannot justify their legitimacy, which is quite commonly the case, to work to undermine them and expand the scope of freedom". That includes political power, ownership and management, relations among men and women, parents and children, our control over the fate of future generations (the basic moral imperative behind the environmental movement, in my view), and much else. Naturally this means a challenge to the huge institutions of coercion and control: the state, the unaccountable private tyrannies that control most of the domestic and international economy, and so on." <a href="http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/rbr/noamrbr2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/rbr/noamrbr2.html" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></p>

It means the development of the individual as well as the assertion of the individual. It means self-responsibility, and not leader worship." (A speech in defense of Emma Goldman)</p>
<p>"Anarchists work towards a society of mutual aid and voluntary co-operation. We reject all government and economic repression."

<p>Bill Christopher, jack Robinson, Philip Sansom and Peter Turner: "Anarchism is a philosophy of freedom. It is a body of revolutionary ideas which reconciles, as no other revolutionary concept does, the necessity for individual freedom woth the demands of society. It is a commune-ist philosophy which starts from the individual and works upwards, instead of starting from the State and working downwards. Social structure in an anarchist society would be carefully and consciously kept to a minimum and would be strictly functional; where organisation is necessary, it would be maintained, but there would be no organisation for its own sake. This would help to prevent the hardening of organisations into instututions - the hard core of government." (published in <i>Freedom</i> in 1970, included in <i>The State is Your Enemy</i>)</p>
<p><a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Guerin_ce62.html" title="Daniel Guerin">Daniel Guerin</a>: "Anarchism is really a synonym for socialism.

Anarchism is only one of the streams of socialist thought, that stream whose main components are concern for liberty and haste to abolish the State." (<i>Anarchism: A Matter of Words</i>) <a href="http://flag.blackened.net/liberty/guerin-anarchism1-1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://flag.blackened.net/liberty/guerin-anarchism1-1.html" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></p>

Not the bomb-in-the-pocket stuff, which is terrorism, whatever name it tries to dignify itself with; not the social-Darwinist economic 'libertarianism' of the far right; but anarchism, as pre-figured in early Taoist thought, and expounded by Shelley and Kropotkin, Goldman and Goodman. Anarchism's principal target is the authoritarian State (capitalist or socialist); its principal moral-practical theme is cooperation (solidarity, mutual aid). It is the most idealistic, and to me the most interesting, of all political theories." ('The Day Before the Revolution', in <i>The Wind's Twelve Quarters</i>, New York, 1975)</p>

<dd>"Economic coercion" is just a propaganda term from a specific camp of anarchists. You might as well try and get Unitarianism taken off a Christianity template because it rejects the Trinity, then post a bunch of Theologians pontificating aout God existing in three persons. One group's propaganda does not define another group out of existence, at least on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../r/e/h/User%7ERehpotsirhc_d5d1.html" title="User:Rehpotsirhc">rehpotsirhc</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada"><font color="red">ââ£â</font></a> âª <a href="../../../r/e/h/User_talk%7ERehpotsirhc_1b9c.html" title="User talk:Rehpotsirhc">Talk</a></sup> 13:37, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If Unitarianism were a minor philosophy regarding religion that existed only in books and on the Internet, and which nearly all other Christians rejected, and which many neutral observers rejected as not actually Christian, then I don't think that there would be any problem with treating it differently, even if there were some people who thought that it was the pinnacle of Christianity. --AaronS 13:40, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"Economic coercion" is one term for a concept that almost all of the definitions I give above acknoledge explicitly or implicitly. Further, nobody is trying to define anarcho-capitalism out of existence. It certainly exists. But it's a seperate movement from anarchism proper, as defined by credible sources above. <a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 13:58, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, it is certainly a philosophical movement. Nobody says it doesn't exist. It's simply not a part of anarchism proper. So, I demonstrated my thesis using the "reliable sources" criterion that you were pushing for. Are you suggesting we change the criteria now? <a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 13:58, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Google hits don't matter, but we've been there, done that. Search for "anarchism -'anarcho-capitalism'" -- or pages about anarchism that make no mention of anarcho-capitalism -- and you get <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=anarchism+-%22anarcho-capitalism%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=anarchism+-%22anarcho-capitalism%22" rel="nofollow">over four million hits</a>. A search for anarcho-capitalism returns only 189,000. But it doesn't really matter, in my opinion. The Internet is not a good indicator of notability or significance.</dd>
<dd>The notability and significance of anarcho-capitalism has always been in question in these discussions. Bureaucrash does not appear to be an anarcho-capitalist organization, and it's not clear that it's significant, either. VMI is not specifically anarcho-capitalist, and is not necessarily significant, either. As for U Chicago, are you speaking of the entire department, or a few faculty members? Again, that's not quite significant.</dd>
<dd>It is unclear that anarcho-capitalism has significantly affected <i>economics</i>, let alone philosophy, politics, or society in general. There is no indication that it is anything more than a blip on the map of the 20th century. --AaronS 14:03, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I should note, as an aside, that this level of insignificance is glaringly obvious in anarcho-capitalists' attempts to give anarcho-capitalism an anarchist pedigree. Anarcho-capitalism does not have a presence of its own; this does not mean that it can exist vicariously through a completely different philosophy and movement that merely shares part of its name. I have nothing against anarcho-capitalism -- I hope that it grows, and that it thrives, and that it comes to define itself and provide an alternative to the current discourse. The more, the merrier. I do have a problem, however, from an academic standpoint, with attempts to claim that it is something that it is not. If anarcho-capitalism were significant, we would not be having this discussion. It could stand on its own. --AaronS 14:12, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well said. Though I can't say I wish the best for anarcho-capitalism, I will say that I'd rather live in a world where the poles are anarchism vs. anarcho-capitalism rather than <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republicrat.html" title="Republicrat">republicrat</a> vs. <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republicrat.html" title="Republicrat">republicrat</a>. <a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 14:15, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I guess we should remove those, as well. "Collectivist anarchism" only gets 751 hits! I think that's well below Wikipedia's standards of notability, not mention to mention any selectively applied standard dreamed up by social anarchists to try and censor the Anarchism template! "What's that you say? Only a <i>few</i> Nobel Prize winning UChicago economists are Anacaps? Not <i>all</i> of them? Not notable enough! My social anarchist friends and I have never heard of the Von Mises Institute or Bureaucrash, so they must not be notable enough!"

<dd>No need to be so inflammatory. I take no stance on whether or not those belong in the template, although some of them, like anarcho-communism and anarcho-syndicalism, are obviously significant when their historical context is taken into consideration. They have had affects on world history and politics, which cannot be said of anarcho-capitalism. On that note, my issue has always been with anarcho-capitalism's significance, not the significance of eco-anarchism or anarcha-feminism, etc. Further, I did not say that I have never heard of VMI or Bureaucrash; I said that they don't appear to be anarcho-capitalist, now, do they? You're swinging at straw men, and I ask that you address my actual arguments, and not try to paint me as a "social anarchist" with some kind of vendetta. Who are these Nobel Prize winning UChicago economists that you speak of? Did they win their Nobel Prizes for writing about anarcho-capitalism? I do not deny that some economists are laissez-faire liberals, or anarcho-capitalists, but, again, what is their impact on the field of economics? --AaronS 14:57, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Anarcho-capitalism is certainly one of the most active philosophical movements of the libertarian right. However, you can't compare a philosophical movement with a social movement. Most of the branches of anarchism listed above are social movements that are currently active or were very influential to the history of anarchism. Anarcho-capitalism has never been a social movement, nor has it been influential in the history of anarchism. <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_%28movement%29.html" title="Anarchism (movement)">Anarchism (movement)</a> a specific historical phenomenon that includes all the active anarchist movements while <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_%28philosophy%29.html" title="Anarchism (philosophy)">Anarchism (philosophy)</a> is a broad conceptual category that includes any theory that can be derrived in whole or in part from Proudhon's conception of anarchism. <a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 18:43, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Who is comparing a philosophical movement with a social movement? Just because anarcho-capitalism is not a social movement, doesn't mean it's not anarchism. Benjamin Tucker's anarchism was not a social movement, but a philosophical movement. It was still anarchism. All individualist anarchism is "philosophical anarchism." Anarcho-communists like to go out and parade in the street, or torch things, or blow things up. Individualists anarchists just write philosophy. <a href="../../../d/t/c/User%7EDTC_5378.html" title="User:DTC">DTC</a> 19:13, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think what he means by "economic coercion" is the claim from some anti-capitalists. They argue that if you require someone to pay you for food if they're hungry, you're coercing them. But obviously you're not coercing them. Their own body is coercing them, not you. Their own biological makeup requires them to eat to live. Who is coercing a person alone in the wilderness to perform labor to catch a wild animal for food? Nobody. Likewise, who is coercing the person to perform labor, or pay with goods or money, in trade for your food? Nobody. Coercion is act peformed by a human agent, not nature. <a href="../../../d/t/c/User%7EDTC_5378.html" title="User:DTC">DTC</a> 19:23, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

But, people are strange. I had my fun with this article, but I feel no need to engage in the kinds of games that some people here, and their sock puppets, seem so fond of.

<dd>Maybe the grammar could be more technically correct though because it's not really the forms of anarchism that say that but certain anarchists.

<dd>I'm not in favor, and like others have already done, I am inclined to revert it. It's just too weasel-y in the wording. The KISS principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid) comes to mind here. I really just want to get any philosophical arguments off the template. We already have criticisms of the concept under three headings in the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> article. Thus we've covered the fact that it is disputed in the article.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Order of schools of anarchist theory</span></h2>
<p>I disagree they should be put in alphabetical order. Sure it is the criterion within which there can be no dispute (a comes before b and c after b), but it is not necessarily the fairest approach and it is definitely not consensual. I believe there are other things to consider. There could be a case where a school that is much less representative, and most far off of what is generally considered to be the core principles of anarchism, appears on top. Some people might find this criterion more reasonable.</p>
<p>I propose to try to put the names of schools in order of historical importance. I think we can find a relatively objective criterion that goes behind personal conviction. Speaking on my part, even though I am pretty much "pro-leftist", for example, I believe that perhaps anarcho-syndicalism should be on top.<a href="../../../m/a/z/User%7EMaziotis_1dcd.html" title="User:Maziotis">Maziotis</a> 16:58, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>My suggestion is that the first schools should be "Syndicalist and Individualist", where you will find the fundamental anarchist debate around individualism vs collectivism, and where most of the anarchist principles are found within the context of the first currents to be formulated in anarchism. Then there could be the femminist school, which is old and points out to principles that cannot be found in the first two. Next, I think it would be fair to choose something outside the sphere of âcollectivistâ or âsocialistâ anarchist schools, like Primitivist and Eco, which may be consider more recent, but are on their own solid anarchist conceptions. I believe this four are the fundamental schools in which most people see themselves. The other schools should be put next and are of course of importance. âmutualistâ school, for example, comes from Proudhon, a father of anarchism, and historically has its weight. Capitalist is much more of a curiosity within the anarchist movement than anything else. The historical argument is most of it base on libertarian ideas, which are not the same thing.</p>

<p>Alphabetical is NPOV. The current ordering is neither historical nor alphabetical. It is appartently syndicalist POV. So I'm changing it back to NPOV alphabetical. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilLiberty_60c2.html" title="User:PhilLiberty">PhilLiberty</a> 22:29, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Syndicalist POV?! Please explain... And please check discussion page on "anarchism" article. We have covered that along with many other users.<a href="../../../m/a/z/User%7EMaziotis_1dcd.html" title="User:Maziotis">Maziotis</a> 22:46, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Before I changed it back to alphabetical order, someone had put "syndicalist" first, and the rest in some unknown (random?) order. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilLiberty_60c2.html" title="User:PhilLiberty">PhilLiberty</a> 21:08, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Because it is first, it means that it is POV-related to it? By that same logic, right now the article is capitalist POV. There was no random order. It was historical, and you can see that other articles, of other countries, have similar approaches. Please read the "anarchism" article to see the order to which the different schools are addressed.<a href="../../../m/a/z/User%7EMaziotis_1dcd.html" title="User:Maziotis">Maziotis</a> 01:46, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi all, I think it'd be a good idea to add <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_and_animal_rights.html" title="Anarchism and animal rights">Anarchism and animal rights</a> to the template, though I've no idea where, and I've never worked on this template before.
