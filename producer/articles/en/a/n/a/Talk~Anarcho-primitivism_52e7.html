<p>Just wanted to say that I'm glad this page has been cleaned up a whole lot since the last time I glanced at it. It's much more coherent and well spoken. Thanks to those that worked on it.</p>

<p>That some primitivists are naturists seems to be a rather minor point in their philosophy to deserve a place in the closing sentence of the introduction. --12.208.107.102 07:57, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Green anarchists are NOT always primitivists. This is implied both on this page and the anarchism page. Many Greens are tecnhnologists, but anti-pollution technologists.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree. I changed the link [[primitivism|green anarchists]] bcuz of this -- and it just redirects&#160;:'( We need a <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_anarchism.html" title="Green anarchism">green anarchism</a> article! -- <a href="../../../t/z/a/User%7ETzartzam_fd7f.html" title="User:Tzartzam">Sam</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>The <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_anarchism.html" title="Green anarchism">green anarchism</a> link still redirects to primitivism... As a non primitivist Green anarchist I could take offense and go start a flame war over this&#160;;-) , agreed we need a seperate GA page, my version of GA is probabably far more in line with Colin Ward/Alan Albon/Freedom/<a href="../../../c/l/i/Clifford_Harper_72e3.html" title="Clifford Harper">Clifford Harper</a> utopian visions than unabomber, etc as fetishised by Paul Rodgers era Green Anarchist magazine... <a href="../../../q/u/e/User%7EQuercusrobur_29af.html" title="User:Quercusrobur">quercus robur</a></p>

<p><i>does the black &amp; green flag need to be so big?</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>No, it doesn't. -- <a href="../../../t/z/a/User%7ETzartzam_fd7f.html" title="User:Tzartzam">Sam</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>It would also be nice if the flag were explained; is it the flag of some particular organized group of anarchists? <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a></p>
<p>It is not the flag of any particular group. It has simply become widely adopted by green anarchists, and is derived from the red anarchist flag which uses red instead of green. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVera_Cruz_69f4.html" title="User:Vera Cruz">Vera Cruz</a></p>
<p>I think this is how it is: anarchists use/d blacka nd red flags. The black flag was a flag that is not a flag, in a way (nice and ironic, of course) -- no symbol or colours (black being the absence of colour). The red, I think, was to represent communism and/or revolution, both seen by many as the means and end of social change.. These two were carried seperately, and are sometimes made into one (see <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-syndicalism.html" title="Anarcho-syndicalism">Anarcho-syndicalism</a>). The flag here is a play on that: the anarchist black is there, the red replaced with green. The green, I assume, is for the harmony primitivists desire to have with nature. Or some stuff like that. -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Francis_c89a.html" title="User:Sam Francis">Sam</a></p>
<p>i think this flag is better seen as the green anarchist flag-primitivists probably have a tree and a mushroom and a starving guy on their flag<a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVera_Cruz_69f4.html" title="User:Vera Cruz">Vera Cruz</a> Seeing as how more people (and a larger percentage) are starving NOW in the techno-industrial modern world than at any other point in history (or pre-history) perhaps the starving guy WOULDN'T appear on the primitivists flag if they had one.</p>
<hr />
<p>Note that all greens are not primitivists but all primitivists are greens. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVera_Cruz_69f4.html" title="User:Vera Cruz">Vera Cruz</a></p>
<p>On Flags, "the workers' flag is deepest red - it shrouded oft our martyrs dead". The Red Flag came from dipping clothe in the blood of someone who had just been injured or killed. The Black Flag also originated in demonstrations where black symbolised those who had been killed. They were only later appropriated by political groups. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarry_Potter_f2d7.html" title="User:Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a></p>
<p>--- Be careful of the word "Greens". That means Green Party to me. I am a primitivist and would be insulted by the implication that I thought civilization could be reformed (and I think that is a widely held idea among primitivists). The flag is decidedly a green anarchist flag and more appropriate for the green anarchist page. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManchineel_09b8.html" title="User:Manchineel">Manchineel</a></p>

<p>How can anyone actualy follow this philospophy (since cars and pollution and mass-extinction and mass starvation at an unprecedented level are so great)? If anyone here knows anyone who even remotely agrees that all technology is bad, and that we should return to being primitive apes I will truely be admazed. If anyone who belives in this philosophy is reading this comment, they're being a hypoctrite, in that they can't use the technology necisary to read it.

<dd>Yeah, it's pretty out there. I can respect the asthetics of "living wild" or whatever, but I do like my technology and it's obvious that we can't support our population without modern agricultural techniques.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Modern agricultural techniques are highly destructive and promote desertification while putting toxic chemicals into the environment. And just because agricultural technology has supported the population this long does not mean the it forever will be able to.</p>

I also think it's a bit un-anarchist to want to force this idea on other people.  (It isn't as if people are actually be bludgeoned with an idea.) I know people who lean in that direction and I've met some people that want to "destroy civilization" including agriculture and <i>language</i>.

<dd>I think you are both missing the point, but unfortunately i have no time to go into specifics here. But i recommend you both to take a look at zine Species Traitor and its fourth issue. Although i don't fully agree with everything there, it puts up some tough guestions about this whole civilized order. And i think the point is not anymore about "what we want", because it's coming to be extremely clear that we can't control the world around us. It's more about "how can we survive?".</dd>

<p>Primitivism and primitive communism are two very different concepts. Primitivism is a position advocated by certain anarchists who believe that technology is a system harmful to life and that the solution to social ills is to abandon and overturn modern technological society and return to the land. The Unabomber is one example of a primitivist. Primitive Communism is what Marxists asserrt was the earliest stage of historical development. It is not something which is advocated for modern society but an historical period. AndyL 08:45, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I find that to be innaccurate, but understand there is not concensus for the merger at this time. <a href="../../../e/x/a/User%7EExample_2365.html" title="User:Example"><i>Example</i></a> (<a href="../../../e/x/a/User_talk%7EExample_2c24.html" title="User talk:Example">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Example_b69c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Example">contribs</a>) 16:16, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I have attempted to bring the page more into accord w your ideas on its purpose, Andy. I also made numerous corrections to repair factual innaccuracy and gross errors of POV. From reading the old article, you might think primitive communism had basis in reality, rather than meerely the whimsical delusions of idealogues. <a href="../../../e/x/a/User%7EExample_2365.html" title="User:Example"><i>Example</i></a> (<a href="../../../e/x/a/User_talk%7EExample_2c24.html" title="User talk:Example">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Example_b69c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Example">contribs</a>) 16:29, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well, I don't know if one can call primitive communism "delusional" (no more than Hobbes' "state of nature" ), certainly there is evidence of hunter-gatherer societies that were collectivist and I believe there are still some around, but it is more of an ideological concept and certainly its based on information garnered when archeology was in its infancy as a science. Anyway, the point is that primitivism as a contemporary theory which advocates a return to a primitive society where primitive communism is a stage in the Marxist conception of history. They are certainly related and I guess one can say that primitivists advocate primitive communism but it should no more be redirected there than to "prehistoric" or "hunter-gatherer society".AndyL 17:07, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Firstly I don't think anyone disputes the collectivist aspect. Its the lack of hierarchy that is delusional, by any objective measure. In any case, the article didn't used to read much different than the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primitive_communism.html" title="Primitive communism">primitive communism</a> article, which is why I intended to merge them. Compare kev's version to mine, and I think you'll see why I felt merger was neccessary. BTW Kev, if you insist on your revert I'll be forced to completely dispute the article, since what you are reverting to is neither neutral in its stance nor remotely factually accurate. <a href="../../../e/x/a/User%7EExample_2365.html" title="User:Example"><i>Example</i></a> (<a href="../../../e/x/a/User_talk%7EExample_2c24.html" title="User talk:Example">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Example_b69c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Example">contribs</a>) 13:11, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Do I particularly care about your threats Jack? Nope. You stuck a couple biased statements into the article, took what was already listed as the anarcho-primitivist viewpoint and added a ton of unnecessary qualifiers, and mangled an otherwise well written piece. And BTW, this may be news to you, but that version is not mine. You see, there are many editors on wikipedia, and I am only one of them. To date, I have never contributed to this particular article before you arrived here, so I have no personal stakes in the version I am reverting to. It is simply better written, more neutral, and more accurate than your ham-fisted edits. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 14:19, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>As usual Sam/Jack is slapping on various warning labels onto articles while blatantly disregarding wiki guidelines. For example, he listed this page on <a href="../../../r/f/c/Wp%7Erfc.html" title="Wp:rfc">RfC</a> before even attempting any kind of dialogue on the subject matter that concerns him contrary to policy. From the RfC page:</p>
<p><i>Whatever the nature of the dispute, the first resort should always be to discuss the problem with the other user. Try to resolve the dispute on your own first.</i></p>
<p>Of course no attempt to resolve the dispute was made beforehand. Furthermore, Sam clearly wants to paint this as a problem with myself as a problem user, thus the insertion of the title "the user in question" over my response to him. Again, he seems unable to read the RfC page,</p>
<p><i>For disputes over user conduct, before requesting community comment, at least two people should have contacted the user on their talk page, or the talk pages involved in the dispute, and failed to resolve the problem.</i></p>
<p>I informed him of this slip up on his own talk page, he merely ignored and deleted it. Then Sam/Jack decided to slap the dispute titles on the article, because he wasn't getting his way. Once again, he ignored the procedure on the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOVD_abfc.html" title="WP:NPOVD">NPOV</a> dispute page,</p>
<p><i>If you add the above code to an article which seems to you to be biased, but there is no prior discussion of the bias, you need to at least leave a note on the article's talk page describing what you consider unacceptable about the article.</i></p>
<p>Clearly Sam thinks the article biased, but there has been no specific discussion on his part of what this bias is. Certainly it is not the case that every sentence in the article is biased, so it is his responsibility to point out where he thinks that bias lies. Personally, I find it strange that he attempted to insert so many qualifiers into an article which already begins by stating in clear terms "according to anarcho-primitivists".</p>
<p>He has claimed on this page that the primitivist belief that some prehistorical societies lacked coercive hierarchy is "delusional", yet in the face of his bold slapping of an accuracy dispute on the article he has done nothing at all to verify either his own claims or any counter-claims to the primitivists with a single citation from any source. Again, ignoring the procedure outlined on the <a href="../../../a/d/_/WP%7EAD_5bbf.html" title="WP:AD">accuracy dispute</a> page he has not bothered to: 1) insert a disputed section in the talk page explaining exactly what he believes is factually inaccurate, 2) insert "dubious" labels in the article itself where appropriate, 3) detail the "more than 5 dubious points" required to justify the accuracy dispute title.</p>
<p>In other words, as usual, Sam is trying to create the appearance of using wiki procedures whilst actually doing his very best to undermine them. He has tried this not only on this article, but also on the anarchism, libertarian socialism, and even anarcho-capitalism articles. Each of those page historys and talk pages currently show the kinds of underhanded techniques Sam is engaging in. I therefore kindly request the following: Sam needs to indicate exactly which statements he finds contrary to NPOV and explain why further qualifiers are needed when this page already indicates that this is merely "according to primitivists" and when the very purpose of this page is, in part, to detail what primitivists believe. Second, he needs to explain -exactly- which statements he believes to be inaccurate, preferably even give some evidence of why we should believe they are inaccurate so that they can be altered/removed. These steps must be taken for the warning labels he has slapped on to be justified.</p>
<p>On a personal note, I would appreciate an apology to the editors of wikipedia for having attempted to unilaterally remove this page by merging it with <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primitive_communism.html" title="Primitive communism">primitive communism</a> without even attempting any dialogue beforehand. It reeks of his previous attempt to delete the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarian_socialism.html" title="Libertarian socialism">libertarian socialism</a> page and to import his own political perspectives on the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a> page, neither of which he has ever apologised for after wasting a lot of time for a lot of people. But somehow I seriously doubt Sam has the integrity to do any of these things, so the simple following of wikipedia policy is all I'm demanding. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 22:57, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>It needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>to clear up that the adoption of agriculture was not a world-wide phenomenon -- that it took place the in the area known as the fertile crescent and then spread from there as those peoples leading agriculturalist lives took over the rest of the world (through both violent force and through spreading their ideology).</li>
<li>how about some anthropological evidence that is used to support the stance? ..For example, "The Original Affluent Society" by Marshall Sahlins <a href="http://www.primitivism.com/original-affluent.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.primitivism.com/original-affluent.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.primitivism.com/original-affluent.htm</a></li>
<li>I think it could benefit from a catagorical organization of the content. Any ideas? That way there could be something like this:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>a general overview/introduction simply describing what it is</li>
<li>then a section outlining the primitivist beliefs and reasoning (which would allow us to state the primitivist stance without being labeled as biased)</li>
<li>a section on the history and current going ons of the movement/community</li>
<li>suggested reading</li>
<li>external links</li>
<li>see also</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>I think the suggested readings section could use better organization. Maybe alphabetical and/or by author? Maybe short synopses that layout out how they relate to primitivism?</li>

<p>I find it weird that the biggest section of this article on anarcho-primitism is devoted to critisizing it.. The "Primitivism on small geographic scales" section critisizes arguements that aren't presented earlier in the article. Also, I don't see how it's fair to critisize anarcho-primitivism for not holding up to judao-christian-capitalist values (violence, life-span). I think those are relatively moot points anyways, because the point of Marshall Sahlins's article (as I remember it) was to describe material wealth as relative to our desires. The second source for that section doesn't make it clear whether things have gone bad for the !kung only in recent years as the outside world has put pressure on them, in which case it is not a valid criticism at all. I also don't see how the criticism of Primitivism in particular on large geographic scales is valid. Nothing works on a large scale. The marketplace isn't working on a large geographic scale. It's just not sustainable. Primitive societies on the other hand have been shown to self-regulate their scale to a size that <i>does</i> support sustainability. And finally, the Michael Albert quote doesn't say anything at all. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThor_Andersen_d6d7.html" title="User:Thor Andersen">Thor Andersen</a> 20:33, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Some of your opinions are corrct IMO (for example your quite right about primitives self regulating the size of their communities to sizes dramatically smaller than modern nations), but in order to be NPOV they would need to be added with citations, added to whats already there, balancing it by addition rather than subtraction, (<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> | <a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESam_Spade_3418.html" title="User talk:Sam Spade">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sam_Spade_c1db.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sam Spade">contributions</a>) 20:41, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The problem with this requirement is that several of the criticisms in the criticism section are currently lacking any citations at all, and in fact are being modified to meet the whims of particular editors. So in accordance with your own stance the NPOV thing to do would be to remove them completely until they are properly documented. However, wikipedia generally frowns on removing content, so until proper documentation can be found for the criticisms themselves there is nothing wrong with supplying primitivist counter-balance that is not cited. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 02:25, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My emphasis was on not deleting, and adding cited info.

I just feel that citations and weblinks on it would be good for the reader. If he has problems finding cites for primitives self regulating community size for example, I'd be happy to help him find cites for that.

<p>Hi, I see that you reverted some changes on the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primitivism.html" title="Primitivism">primitivism</a> article that I made. Specifically, I'd like to disagree with your reinstatement of the opening line that reads: <i>Primitivism or anarcho-primitivism is an anti-technological critique of the origins and progress of civilization.</i></p>
<p>While primitivism is clearly characterized by luddism, it is first and foremost a perspective in opposition to civilization (something which is not built on technology alone). The origin of civilization was agriculture (domestication of food), which, in its infancy, was not dependent on significant technology. Thus the opening sentence does not entirely make sense (unless civilization is in reference to <i>industrial</i> civilization only). Please let me know if you disagree. - Nihila 15:56, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not very much, you make a good point.

Also I thought the link to technology was cool.

<p>I noticed at the bottom of the page the <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amish.html" title="Amish">Amish</a> are included as a 'See Also', I didn't take it out assuming you had a good reason to have it there but does it really fit? It seems like the Amish are simply resisting further technology but they're fine with their current level (and according to the article have been known to officially 'up' it at yearly votes). Beyond this they aren't really working toward any kind of societal change, egalitarianism etc, they're just kicking it until Jesus comes back. I would put the Amish as luddites and not primitivists in that they're fearful of technology but not actively working to revert or change society.</p>

<p>Hmmm, Kev, I was under the impression that Primitivists (capital P to represent the movement) resist technology for the reasons of creating a new society based on equality and justice. Thats why I differentiated the motives of the Amish and Primitivists (particularly as this article discusses). It seems to me that motive is the crux in this case. Although I do think you're point about 'see also' housing even tangentially related subjects as a pretty good reason to keep it there. I guess I'm just wondering what the Amish community would think about Primitivism but for some reason I get the feeling they're not going to weigh in on this here.</p>
<p>Sam (and Che kind of), I think this might actually prove the article isn't untenable, although I have to admit, I'm not completely clear on why you believe it is lost. You seem to want to roll it into Anarcho-primitivism but I think Kev's concern is that not all primitivism (lower case to represent a state of being) is anarchist and vice versa. This is kind of my concern with the Amish, while they're 'primitive' by our societal standards, they're pretty certainly not anarchist. I'm just further wondering if they're (the Amish) really 'Primitivist' as a movement or not. If they're really just primitive and not Primitivist it seems at least to me kind of misleading to leave them on the page. But then again it does seem tangentially applicable.</p>

<dd>Well actually, I proposed the opposite. Primitivism seeks to abolish society all together, where as anarchism seeks to establish non-hierarchal society. Which is why I suggest that the anarcho-primitivism article be rolled into this one.--<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChe_y_Marijuana_56bf.html" title="User:Che y Marijuana"></a> <small><small><small><a href="http://www.revolutionaryleft.com" class="external text" title="http://www.revolutionaryleft.com" rel="nofollow">Revolutionary Left</a></small></small></small> | <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChe_y_Marijuana_56bf.html" title="User:Che y Marijuana">Che y Marijuana</a> 18:06, Apr 6, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Primitivism does not seek to "abolish society all together." It merely wishes to abolish civilization. Primitive SOCIETY would still exist.</p>
<p>Ah! Well, I'll leave you guys to argue about that but I think you've made my point again. The Amish aren't interested in either of those goals (they intend to maintain their hierarchical society) the only relationship is that they reject technology to a certain degree which again, tangentially makes sense but I think is ultimately misleading. I think I've decided what I'm going to do, I'm just going to add a short sentence after 'the amish' link that discusses why its there and why it maybe shouldn't be. Sound good?</p>

<p>Do most people who want to elimitate (all but rudimentary) technology and civilization identify as anarchists? I was under the impression that many would advocate local/tribal forms of government. It seems that this article has more to do with primitivism than "anarcho-primitivism," and the latter really only needs to be a brief article that states that anarcho-primitivists are self-identified anarchists who are primitivists and discuss the noteworthy individuals and groups. The main article should be about primitivism (anarcho or otherwise) and adress that philosophy in more depth.</p>
<p>No they wouldnt. They see the social structure which developed with agriculture as the enemy. Hunter gather tribes (which humanity spent most of its history as, so allegedly we are evolved to live as and so will be happiest as) had no use for such structures as local government.</p>

<p>The article presents anarcho-primitivists as a cohesive group. Are there any schisms? For example are there any who reject the state/society and want to rewild, but dont see technology as intrisnicly connected to state/society and reckon they could incorporate some. Are any that advocate a limited version due to the worlds population.</p>
<p>The article seems very critical of all anarcho-primitivism. Quite possibly because it treats anarcho-primitivism as a cohesive ideology. I cant contest that for all mankind to go back to hunter gathering wed need a few hundred more planets. However, societal critique can be really really good even if the solution is a pipedream (ie marx).

<dd>Well, of course every anarcho-primitivist does not agree with every other anarho-primitivist when it comes to technology, domestication, symbolic culture/thought or language. And about everyone returning to hunter-gatherer -lifestyles immediately, Zerzan himself has said (if i remember correctly it was in discussion with Lawrence Jarach about primitivism, check insurgentdesire) that a good practice would be "creating edible landscapes", what i interpret to mean forest gardening approach to growing food that still contains some domesticating elements but is a great step towards de-domestication, and able to produce big amounts of food in limited space and with low energy input. Personally i think that's the best way to avoid (or limit) die-off.</dd>

<dd>Honestly, I think anarcho-primitivism might be a misnomer, as I think Zerzan simply says "primitivism" (although Zerzan is, of course, an anarchist.) It seems like primitivism in the strongest sense (return to hunting and gathering) would be effectively anarchist, but there are a variety of ideas that head in that direction that don't necessarily have to be anarchist, such as the Gandhian idea of <i><a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarvodaya.html" title="Sarvodaya">sarvodaya</a></i> (that article itself isn't informative, but you can look elsewhere).

<p>You wanted one, you got one. I don't believe that technology is evil either. I just think that the best lifestyle one could have would be the primitivist lifestyle. Who wants to work their entire lives? Who wants to struggle in order to survive? Who wants to do what their boss tells them to, even if you don't wish to? How about when you were younger, if you're parents told you to do something? The basis of primitivism is not anti-tech, but anti-control. Controlling others forms the basis of civilization. Civilization makes technological advancements for warfare and to try and keep the general population happy. I have no problem using technology to spread the idea around. Read this quote: "No group on earth has more leisure time than hunters and gatherers, who spend it primarily on games, conversation and relaxing."(Kirkpatrick Sale, "Dwellers in the Land: The Bioregional Vision"). Are you telling me you'd rather work like hell your whole life for a few comforts that civilization can provide? Oh and as a side note, I would consider the Unabomer as a green anarchist, not a primitivist because he is specifically against the Industrial Revolution. And as for that question by Crippled Sloth, you can look into Neo-Tribalism, but if you're focusing on non-anarchy, you should realize what that means. Also, one can't just say anarcho-primitivist is anti-tech, or that they just want to be hunter-gatherers because it's deeper than that. It's about true freedom, none of that total bull you get about America being founded on freedom. Some more recent hunter-gatherers were cattle herders, and the American Indians are also not an example of a primitivist society, even they had signs of civilization. This article does a nice job of showing the specifics, but it doesn't directly say it being outright against being controlled or controlling others. Primitivists are the only group that are against the control of any life, be it human, plant, or animal. There may even be a few green anarchists who are not primitivists that are against control. Reread this article and look closely at all that's said, then tell me if you still think, "How can anybody believe in this stuff?"</p>

<p>All of our technology today is the result of the efforts of specific scientists throughout history. In modern society, your average person could not build a t.v., computer, refridgerator, or even a toaster if left to their own devices. The mass of human population is living comfortably of the efforts of our predecessors, and they did nothing to deserve it. They cannot claim to have helped create their glorius society in any way, yet most of them would die if they had to leave it and enter the natural world. The result is a modern people who are too weak from easy living to survive without the dillusions that they call the "real world." It would be interesting to see the weak rooted out this world by the collapse of civilization. It would be interesting to see the wealthy die once people wake up and realize that money is an evil dillusion.

<p>Theodore Kaczynski’s proposal is still in favor of a shift to living in the wild. Since he is an anarchist and he states clearly in his manifesto that his proposition is the wilderness, I would like to know what are these “features” of the civilization that he would like to keep. If you read “hit where it hurts” and the response of other primitivists, you might understand that this insistence to deal with the industrial system above all else has got to do more with an issue of the revolution’s strategy.</p>
<p>There isn’t a defense of pre-industrial societies in absolute, at any point of his writings. He does make comparisons in order to express, for example, how modern societies have devolpt psychological problems to which the explanation must concern more that overpopulation. But at no point he defends any of these “features” as being part of the description of a better future society.</p>
<p>I believe that the setence in the first paragraph, concerning ted's views on society, is wrong and we should change to the one before.<a href="../../../m/a/z/User%7EMaziotis_1dcd.html" title="User:Maziotis">Maziotis</a> 13:14, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Personally I don't agree with most of the fact tags you added. For example:</dd>

<dl>
<dd>“Primitivists argue that prior to the advent of agriculture humans lived in small, nomadic bands which were socially, politically, and economically egalitarian.[citation needed] Being without hierarchy, these bands are sometimes viewed as embodying a precursor to anarchism.”</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is true that it is not a widely recognizable fact that "prior to the advent of agriculture humans lived in small, nomadic bands which were socially, politically, and economically egalitarian.". But the point that is being made in the article is that primitivists argue that this is true. This is an undisputable and very visible fact. And it is just not practical to give reference to every affirmation given. This one in particular is very accessible and widely recognizable for anyone who is introduced to anarcho-primitivism. Further discussion on the grounds of these assertions is discussed further in the article. But even that necessity is of ideological concern, and, in terms of the encyclopedic quality, a matter of content.<a href="../../../m/a/z/User%7EMaziotis_1dcd.html" title="User:Maziotis">Maziotis</a> 13:51, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I don't want to get personal here, but basically you have just butchered the article. Just try looking here on wikipedia for articles such as "democracy", "fascism" and think about applying your criterion. You will see there are many sentences there, which you can only find explanation in a political science manual, and that for which there is no reference. For example:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Representative</dd>
<dd>Representative democracy involves the selection of government officials by the people. Representatives may be elected by a particular district (or constituency), or represent the electorate as a whole as in many proportional systems, with some using a combination of the two. Some representative democracies also incorporate elements of direct democracy, such as referenda. A characteristic of representative democracy is that while the representatives are elected by the people, to act in their interest, they retain the freedom to exercise their own judgement as to how best to do so. While considerations such as party alignment, perception of voter wishes or the public interest, re-election prospects and other factors can be of influence, there are generally few binding restrictions."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is simply not practical and a matter of a point of view to discuss the grounds of each sentence in an article. "Fact tags" are meant for assertions that can be falsified, disputable. For example: "Ghandi in 1923 said that anarcho-primitivism is great." <a href="../../../m/a/z/User%7EMaziotis_1dcd.html" title="User:Maziotis">Maziotis</a> 13:51, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I agree with you that this article would greatly benefit with more citations. But the "citation needed" mark is only to be used for disputable assertions that are presented as facts, otherwise its use would be simply disruptive and POV. There function is to tag a statement as to be verifiable, not to be used as a challenge for wikipedians to better improve an article. Please see <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">Wikipedia:Citing sources</a> for future improvement of the article. You will find, for example, that in <a href="../../../s/c/i/Wikipedia%7EScientific_citation_guidelines_1eb9.html" title="Wikipedia:Scientific citation guidelines">Wikipedia:Scientific citation guidelines</a> (written for Mathematics, Physics, Molecular and cellular biology and Chemistry) this problem is discussed, where it says: “The verifiability criteria require that such statements be sourced so that in principle anyone can verify them. However, in many articles it is cumbersome to provide an in-line reference for every statement. In addition, such dense referencing can obscure the logical interdependence of statements. Therefore, in sections or articles that present well-known and uncontroversial information – information that is readily available in most common and obvious books on the subject – it is acceptable to give an inline citation for one or two authoritative sources at the start (and possibly a more accessible source, if one is available) in such a way as to indicate that these sources can be checked to verify later statements for which no in-line citation is provided."<a href="../../../m/a/z/User%7EMaziotis_1dcd.html" title="User:Maziotis">Maziotis</a> 15:27, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>There was a non-primitivist site that was doubled referenced in the external links section. I deleted those two, as they are not related to the article, but left the text concerning the negative crique of primitivism alone. I don't know if it should be delted by another criterion, but the other references to the links of the main site had to be deleted.<a href="../../../m/a/z/User%7EMaziotis_1dcd.html" title="User:Maziotis">Maziotis</a> 13:05, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
