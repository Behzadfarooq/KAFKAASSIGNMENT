<p>Removing the bizarre Buddhism/Hinduism sectioning, as Hinduism has no doctrine of anatman, and having multiple headings for different traditions, at least in the Eastern philosophy and religion WP articles, is used to denote different versions of the same doctrine.

<p>If one can accept the concept of anatta but have a problem with the whole concept of rebirth then the 'troubling' concept is rebirth and not anatta.

<p>+++Students I have encountered "have a problem" with rebirth (although my teacher taught of the rebirth of the separate self during our daily lives, like when you see someone who ticked you off last week and the anger arises.) But past life experiences do come up in practice, and the bottom line is, we don't know why that is. It just can't really be explained- it is THUS. But the teaching of anatta IS the central teaching of Buddhism, and one that, while simple to cognize, is extremely difficult to get. It is unsettling to say the least, it turns the student inside out and upside down. The Wisdom sutras caution over and over about Bodhisattvas who are stricken with terror when confronted with Emptiness.+++ (Lisa M, Portland, OR)</p>

<dd>I don't actually care if the issue of anatta v. rebirth is included at all; I think it's a silly topic, myself. However, it is an existent topic, and a defensible one, as some Buddhists have had considerable trouble with it: for example, the Yogacara and Pudgalavada schools.&#160;::grin:: My point regarding which should come first is simply that, as this is the Anatta page, the material should only be included if it is primarily a problem with the doctrine of Anatta; if the problem is with the doctrine of rebirth, than that should go in the rebirth article. I think that <i>pertinence</i> is a fairly "good reason" for doing something on WP. Your "sidestep" however, is perfectly satisfactory.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The bit "The Buddha avoided metaphysical discussions generally, but discussed" I originally deleted because it's simply wrong; the Buddha didn't avoid metaphysical discussions generally, he avoided certain specific metaphysical discussions, such as the origin of the world and the condition of the enlightened after enlightenment. Pratitya-samutpada, anatta, and other important, characteristically Buddhist topics the Buddha focused on are totally metaphysical. I also don't see why it's necessary to include a comment on the scope of the Buddha's metaphysical treatment here in the first place. So, my stance on that point is, either edit it into an accurate and pertinent statement, or take it out.<a href="../../../k/u/k/User%7EKukkurovaca_0e50.html" title="User:Kukkurovaca">कुक्कुरोवाच</a> 18:13, 27 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Kukkurovaca I think that it’s fair that reference should be made both here in the anatta article and in the rebirth article on the common problem many have on the seeming mutually exclusivity of anatta and rebirth. It seems that the duplication is justifiable and reasonable in the circumstances and especially relevant to both. I have no problem losing the bit about the Buddha not entering into metaphysical discussion, this was not my prose, I have no attachment to it and am inclined to agree with you, rather take it out as it detracts from the exposition of anatta.

<p>&gt;Some Buddhists take the position that the basic problem of explaining how "I" can die and be reborn is, philosophically speaking, no more problematic than how "I" can be the "same" person I was a few moments ago. There is no more or less ultimacy, for Buddhists, between the identity I have with my self of two minutes ago and the identity I have with the self of two lives ago. &lt;</p>
<p>Not sure if it's just me, but the above argument is particularly eyebrow raising. The argument is that there is no more problem conceiving the difference between the moment to moment transient state of a metabolizing organism than the purported link between completely different organisms with no provable linkage, call me old fashioned but that's a stretch! Do significant number of Buddhists hold this view or do Buddhist that are attached to the concept of rebirth generally concede that the whole concept is a matter of belief? --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick-in-South-Africa_221f.html" title="User:Nick-in-South-Africa">Nick-in-South-Africa</a> 17:16, 3 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, the point isn't that rebirth is somehow a self-evident truth (it's not), but that <i>if</i> rebirth occurs, it's not in any automatic conflict with anatta, unless momentary existence is as well. And for some, of course, there is a problem with accounting for both daily existence and reincarnation without an atman, which of course gives us the Pudgala, Buddha-nature, and other debates.<a href="../../../k/u/k/User%7EKukkurovaca_0e50.html" title="User:Kukkurovaca">कुक्कुरोवाच</a></dd>

<dd>Kukkurovaca My reaction is the same as your argument is the same but using different words! My point is that the concept of anatta is to anyone with a little bit of objectivity, quite self evident. It’s very straightforward to observe that there is no abiding, static self, what we are is in a state of change moment to moment from conception through to death and decompostion. There is after all no evidence for an abiding self other than our feeling or sense of 'me'. This 'me' feeling is easy to explain by what is known from science and psychology. The concept of rebirth does not succumb to this or indeed any objective approach and is seemingly in direct logical contradiction with the concept of rebirth, the two concepts are mutually exclusive. Thus I posit that one can accept the concept of anatta easily based on observation and knowledge of reality but the concept of re birth requires belief. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick-in-South-Africa_221f.html" title="User:Nick-in-South-Africa">Nick-in-South-Africa</a> 07:15, 6 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hm. Well, to be quite frank with you, I have no interest in reincarnation, personally, and I agree that it's not a particularly convincing doctrine. However, this is my POV and I try to check it when editing articles about Buddhism, a tradition in which reincarnation is generally assumed as a fact of nature. I object, however, to the suggestion that anatta is "based on observation and knowledge" in contradistinction to belief; belief as at the heart of all knowledge, even knowledge based on observation. Anatta is indeed more parcimonious, but nowhere does Buddhism claim to accept Occam's razor as an epistemological principle. (Though some thinkers like Nagarjuna clearly embody it in their work.) Nor do I see the mutual exclusivity.</dd>

<dd>Now, I've known people who believe in reincarnation (or "rebirth" or whatever folk want to call it), and whose appeal is to their direct experience of past-life memories, etc. I don't find this argument convincing, but maybe that's just because I haven't had a similar experience. In any case, theirs too is an appeal to knowledge based on observation. It is not that the one belief (in anatta) is somehow valid or obvious or self-evident and that the other belief (in reincarnation) is not; it is simply that you and I find the one compelling for ourselves and the other not, while the majority of Buddhists find both compelling. <a href="../../../k/u/k/User%7EKukkurovaca_0e50.html" title="User:Kukkurovaca">-- कुक्कुरोवाच</a>|<a href="../../../k/u/k/User_talk%7EKukkurovaca_0af9.html" title="User talk:Kukkurovaca">Talk‽</a> 22:38, May 6, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nick, I am not sure I understand your question. The idea is that just as the person I am right now has a strong influence from the person I was two minutes ago, it is just as true that I am also influenced by those of generations past. I personally believe that the whole problem is located in the unfortunate use of "reincarnation" in many instances where rebirth is meant. <a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuis_Dantas_e357.html" title="User:Luis Dantas">Luis Dantas</a></dd>

<dl>
<dd>Luis The argument that anybody alive today has been influenced by past generations is fine. However to my understanding 'reincarnation' and 'rebirth' are exactly matching synonyms and acceptance of rebirth/reincarnation requires accepting that some entity or essence of self gets to come back after death, and that's not the same argument. What do you see as the difference between rebirth and reincarnation? --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick-in-South-Africa_221f.html" title="User:Nick-in-South-Africa">Nick-in-South-Africa</a> 07:15, 6 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nope, <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reincarnation.html" title="Reincarnation">reincarnation</a> is actually impossible according to <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebirth_%28Buddhist%29_a2b9.html" title="Rebirth (Buddhist)">buddhist rebirth</a> doctrine. That is both my personal opinion and that of my contacts from the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theravada.html" title="Theravada">Theravada</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/t/Soto_Zen_a2bd.html" title="Soto Zen">Soto Zen</a> and Tibetan <a href="../../../v/a/j/Vajrayana.html" title="Vajrayana">Vajrayana</a> schools. I am pretty sure the same is also true of <a href="../../../j/o/d/Jodo_Shinshu_ca90.html" title="Jodo Shinshu">Jodo Shinshu</a>. The difference between the two concepts is pretty much what you point out: there is no self to reincarnate, but there are karmic tendencies that get reborn. Reincarnations, if they happened in reality, would be something like resuming one's life from the point it stopped in death (incidentally, that would make for quite a different world from the one we live on - but I digress). Rebirth involves no "essences" nor "entities". It is just the natural progress of expressing desires and attachments that are not duly resolved yet. It is possible and likely that many people through the centuries failed to understand the difference, but it is still a clear-cut difference, always was. To be fair, there are <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/modern/thanissaro/notself.html" class="external text" title="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/modern/thanissaro/notself.html" rel="nofollow">those who claim</a>] that this doctrine is meant as a didactical tool rather than a metaphysical truth. For practical purposes it does not matter. If a being's sense of self changes, it is very accademic to claim either that it is the same being as in the past or that it is not the same being. <a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuis_Dantas_e357.html" title="User:Luis Dantas">Luis Dantas</a></dd>

<dd>I never heard of that (and would welcome a reference&#160;:), but that is not necessarily the case. All that would indicate is that Tenzin Gyatso somehow inherited a sense of self from someone else. That is a far cry from actually being someone reincarnated. Incidentally, I am not sure there is such a thing as an actual Buddhist theology - or perhaps even more acuratelly, we could say that there are several, mainly defined by national custom. <a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuis_Dantas_e357.html" title="User:Luis Dantas">Luis Dantas</a></dd>

<dd>Luis, The point was meant to be ironic and humorous, my apologies if it didn’t work for you. That said the cliché is true, many a true word is said in jest. If one describes oneself as a Buddhist it is a poor choice of words to my mind in the context of the Dharma (teachings of the Buddha) because for most with a non Buddhist paradigm or World view it suggests attachment to Buddhist doctrine, which rather contradicts the alleged Siddhatha's alleged teaching and gets the mind moving in the wrong direction.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick-in-South-Africa_221f.html" title="User:Nick-in-South-Africa">Nick-in-South-Africa</a> 16:30, 7 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Kukkurovaca, Because most educated people in developed countries are more familiar with the main theistic religions and thus tend to look at Buddhism with this mindset; they tend to look for equivalences.

<dd>Okay, still not quite up to speed. Is your claim (1) that theistic religion automatically implies attachment, and (2) that the label "Buddhism" is, as it were, guilty by association? Because I'm not sure either that most people think of Buddhism as a "real" religion (in fact, I think the opposite problem occurs--people thinking of Buddhism as something modular you can just stick on an existing worldview), or that theistic religion is intrinsically tied to attachment. <a href="../../../k/u/k/User%7EKukkurovaca_0e50.html" title="User:Kukkurovaca">-- कुक्कुरोवाच</a>|<a href="../../../k/u/k/User_talk%7EKukkurovaca_0af9.html" title="User talk:Kukkurovaca">Talk‽</a> 21:30, May 8, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Kukkurovaca, Yes I do think theistic religions are very much attachment centric, and that's to my mind the BIG difference between theistic religions and Buddhist teaching. The very core of Buddhist teaching is geared to developing a mind posture of constructive non-attachment.</dd>

<dd>The issue you describe of Buddhism being seen as a bolt on option to an existing World view does occur to some extent. However this is an increasing trend generally in developed countries in all religions. People seem to choose their beliefs 'a la carte', only a small proportion are rigidly dogmatic and believe the full gambit of theology within their declared religion.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick-in-South-Africa_221f.html" title="User:Nick-in-South-Africa">Nick-in-South-Africa</a> 10:45, 9 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

Buddhists understand that the need for familiar references is natural to <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samsara.html" title="Samsara">Samsara</a>. It is certainly true that a Buddhist is expected to avoid unneeded attachment. It is just as true that one can't really help it in many real life situations.

<dd>I don't think that to describe oneself as a Buddhist is to miss the point (as it is simply claiming allegiance to the teachings of the Buddha), but then I'm not a Buddhist either, so&#160;::shrug::. Now, people are really making far too much of this reincarnation/rebirth thing; it's the same concept, but with orthodox Indian philosophy it implies a substantial essence that transmigrates, with some schools of Buddhism it implies something very like a substantial essence that transmigrates, and with the rest of Buddhism it does not imply a substantial essence that transmigrates.

<dd>There is quite a bit of support for buddhist un-substantial rebirth in modern science. First there's the basic genetic inheritance, then there's the (semi-buzzword) concept of memes. On the most fundamental level rebirth in buddhism is, in my opinion, identical to the concept of dependent origination, which in turn is identical to cause and effect in science. Fragments of karma in these shapes (genes, memes and other types of more controllable action) do flow around, that's pretty clear. [[User:boxed|boxed] 12:21, 2005-10-18 CET</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Recent Massive Alterations and Additions</span></h2>
<p>Hallo to whomever wrote the new introductory version on "anatta". I personally love most of what you have added - you will find no greater supporter of the viewpoint you express than myself. I have spent the past 25 years arguing for it! But as editors of an encyclopaedia such as this we have to strive to be balanced and impartial. So I do think that, for example, it is simply not factually correct to state that the "majority" of Buddhists take the view that the non-Self doctrine relates only to the ephemeral elements of the being and that there is some higher, eternal Self beyond that, untouched by the "non-Self" teachings. As much as I myself deplore this fact and believe that the general understanding of "non-Self" is seriously wrongheaded and distortionist, the truth is that most Buddhist schools do not express the stance that you (and I) uphold. So I think we do need to stick to the word "minority" here. Also, the piece needs to be tidied up grammatically here and there. All together, though, I personally think the additions are excellent. But I am sure that nearly everybody else will wildly disagree with me (and with you!). Warm wishes.

<p>Your concerns of being "balanced and impartial" are irrelavent to doctrinal inaccuracy. Foremostly an encyclopedia is meant to accurately reflect, in the case of religions, the doctrine it is referencing. What "most Buddhist schools" express in their secular commentary is irrelavent, all religoius debates and references are and must be SOLA SCRIPTURA (based in Doctrine); not to reflect what the "masses accept/hold dear" I have replaced the word majority, back to minority, since that is factually accurate as the view itself is concerned...

<p>Attasarana has little experience with Wikipedia, but could possibly be a very valuable source, if he can learn some degree of pluralism. His contribution to this article is impressive, but POV, and he seems to be reluctant to accept non-Nikaya Buddhism as being legitimate; I am attempting to encourage him to discuss his contributions, but so far to no avail. The contents of his work are in Talk:Anatta:Attasarana (<a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E20040302.html" title="User:20040302">20040302</a> 18:20, 18 December 2005 (UTC))</p>
<ul>
<li>Hallo again. Thanks for the comments. Good to know that you share my view that Attasarana has things to say which are worth hearing. To be fair to him, I think Attasarana does not deny all non-Nikayan texts as expressive of "genuine" Buddha-Dharma (I note that elsewhere he supports the teachings of the <i>Mahaparinirvana Sutra</i> on the Self, for instance). I think it would be good if Attasarana's very valuable and noteworthy information were given a highlighted section in the main "Anatta" entry (a section of its own, I mean). I know most Buddhists will not share his views (although I myself am totally at one with Attasarana in his take on Self and non-Self in Buddha-Dharma), but still there should be room, I believe, for important sutta/sutra-based commentaries such as this in the main body of the text. It seems a shame to me to relegate his useful information (even if many question the interpretation of it) to a kind of "back page". Can I prevail upon you and other Wiki editors to restore it, under its own separate heading??? Best wishes to you.

<p>--You,User:20040302, have commited an unsubstantiated claim and fallacy in presuming presecular doctrinal citation is "POV" (point of view). The point of any encyclopedia is accurate, factual and substantiated information devoid of later secular slants, specifically all religious information and debate is Sola Scriptura (based in Doctrine), not conjecture or POV. Your re-edit which reads "doctrine of anatta" is nothing found in either the Nikayas, the Lankavatara, the Sadharmapudarika, the Mahaparinirvana sutra and others, its a secular commentary by later-day Nihlists upon Buddhism, it in fact has no scriptural basis in fact or in logic, ergo your re-edit which read "doctrine of anatta" is both a baseless claim and an illogical non-doctrinal conjecture utterly foriegn to Buddhism. Without a sutric citation to back up your claims, of which one doesnt exist, I'm afraid youve only stated as fact, something utterly untrue as well as illogical.

<dd>It appears that you are used to writing academic literature for academics, and therefore, your particular community has a set of conventions as to what is, and what is not acceptable (This is most evident by the statement <i>all religious statements must be Sola Scriptura (based in Doctrine</i> - this is not a <a href="../../../r/u/l/WP%7ERULES_e375.html" title="WP:RULES">Wikipedia Rule</a> ) . An encyclopedia has a broader audience, and needs to meet the issues of that audience, which often includes informing practioners about the views of their own schools.

<dd>"At no time has the Tathagata taught that there is no Soul". Soul is, of course, a technical term, which can be interpreted in several distinct ways. Certainly Candrakirti makes it clear that according to the Middle-way school, when we identify 'self' as 'essence', then it does not exist. Regardless, I doubt that any Buddhist school denies the conventional, day-to-day appelation of self - as found in statements regarding activities eg: "I saw my mother yesterday", however, it appears that there is less agreement concerning a metaphysically existent soul, or selfhood that is distinct from that. It is pretty clear to me that a deep-rooted belief in essence directly leads to attachment and aversion, from which suffering arises. I do not need to depend upon scripture to see that, and yet that is what I find being stated in the <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twelve_Nidanas_9ffc.html" title="Twelve Nidanas">Twelve Nidanas</a>, which lie at the very root of Buddhism, forming the foundation of the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Four_Noble_Truths_6562.html" title="Four Noble Truths">Four Noble Truths</a>. As for the metaphysical existence (or not) of a soul - I doubt that one can meaningfully talk about such things without some careful definition.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If we read Mahavagga-Att. 3.270 - "atman is one's svabhava", then we have exchanged 'soul' with 'nature' - so, if we identify this statement in terms of paramartha, maybe we see what is known as the Mahayana tathagathagarbha - buddha-nature, which is the sole refuge; however, this is not really what is meant by the term 'soul' in an everyday sense (samvrti). Svabhava has several distinct meanings in Buddhism (which changes according to school) for instance (middle-way school) - it is something to be ultimately asserted (when equated with paramartha), to be completely denied (when equated with intrinsic existence), and to be conventionally asserted (when equated with samvrti). So similarly, according to the context of the definition, atman is to be asserted or denied accordingly.

<p>I'm sure your pali is better than mine, Nick. However, wouldn't the phrase "sabbe dhammā anattāti" translate well as "all phenomena are not a soul"? Those are the words uttered by the Buddha in the Cūlasaccaka Sutta, the 35th sutta in the Majjhima Nikāya.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Flagged</span></h2>
<p>I've flagged this for questionable NPOV. Anatta is interpreted as "not-self" (as in, lacking an independent soul) by the majority of "Buddhists" I'm familiar with (including myself). There does, of course, exist the minority. However, this article seems to imply that claiming the doctrine of Anatta supports the concept of no soul is like claiming the Earth is flat.</p>
<p><br />
Anatta is an Adjective, at no time in any sutta, Nikaya or Mahayana sutra does anatta occur as the denial of soul (atman, Pali: Attan). Youve just commited a Bandwaggon fallacy and privided no empirical citations from Sutras to back up your baseless claim, therefore it is rejected outright.</p>

Original Poster in this thread, "original research" does not apply to the fact that Anatta is A: an Adjective B: all 662 occurances of same are: A is anatta, B is anatta.

<p>All 662 occurances of the term anatta are as an Adjective, there exists not ONE doctrinal passage which upholds the secular conviction of modern Buddhism that "anatta means there is no soul taught in Buddhism".

In fact, there is no person on this planet that knows more about the term Anatta/Anatman than myself. If you wish to refute ANY FACT or citation posted, then do so, otherwise your opinions and secular agenda are ruining the article.</p>
<p>[User - Nat Krause] Has made many baseless conjectures and offered no contribution to the definition, either by way of logic, citation, or philosophical discussion before making massive texts removals. I forward that such actions are Sophistic attempts that are agenda driven secular attempts at subterfuge. How do you know that you have grasped the truth of what you say? You must have some criterion, otherwise you will be unsure. Nat Krause without doctrinal criterion, the definition of anatta is merely a reductionistic and futile sophistry "I said so. No, I said so". Substantial claims, Nat, you must learn, require substantial evidences</p>
<p>Buddhologists that posit the Soul within Buddhism and that anatta is undeniably an adjective are here listed just a few of many as follows: Radhakrishnan, F.L. Woodward, Dr. Kanai Lal Hazra, Dr. CAF Rhys Davids, Dr. Joaquin Perez-Ramon, Govind Pande Chande, I.B. Horner, E.M. Hare, Dr. Peter Masefield,George Grimm, Dr. Harsh Narain, Prof. And Dr. A.K. Coomaraswamy</p>
<p>No-Soul in Pali is not anatta, but Natthatta; there are only 5 occurances of "no soul" NATTHATTA' at SN 4.400, where Vaccagotta asks Gotama “is it so then, Lord Gotama that there is no soul?” (natthatta’).</p>
<p>Nat, any attempt on your part to intelligently discuss the Buddhist term ANATTA without using your personal belief system has been an utter failure. Thankfully, your opinions are not found within the doctrine of Buddhism. It is odd that your are attempting to inseminate others with your fanatical opinions as opposed to trying to skillfully disseminate the doctrine of Buddhism.</p>
<p>No religious definition can exist outside of scripture, be it Buddhist, Christian or otherwise. There is no doctrinal substantiation for the term anatta/anatman outside of that posted on the main thread; views to the contrary require substantial evidences, citations, and logic. - S.A.

<dd>Wikipedia is intended to present a survey of generally accepted knowledge. Attasarana has his views, but they do not represent the viewpoint of either any traditional Buddhist sect or the analyses of Western scholarship. The question is not whether Attasarana's views are in some sense <i>correct</i> or not; the question is whether they belong in survey articles on Buddhism or Buddhist concepts. Idiosyncratic viewpoints are all very well, but it's not part of Wikipedia's raison d'être to present them; that's what individual web pages are for. Attasarana's got his web page. He doesn't need Wikipedia to present his views. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandomCritic_f342.html" title="User:RandomCritic">RandomCritic</a> 02:11, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I note also that when Attasarana moved material around to insert his own lengthy commentary, my original post mysteriously changed. I trust this was merely accidental, because if it wasn't it would be decidedly uncool. The first sentence actually read:

Again, you have made endless baseless claims and are utterly unlearned in the contextual ussage of this term in Buddhist doctrine.</p>
<p>As for the "analyses of Western scholarship" I've provided a list of Western Buddhologists who are in full agreement upon same. It seems you have a knack for manufacturing endless CLAIMS but are utterly incapable of providing evidences, as such, your viewpoint is without merit as regards the definition of anatta/anatman.</p>
<p>Youve also commited a Strawman fallacy in saying I have presented "my views" when in fact i have given more than ample citations and logic to same. Unless your are able to make an intelligent contribution based upon citations, logic, reasonings, you are trolling wikipedia.</p>
<p>"Idiosyncratic viewpoints" is another baseless claim and strawman fallacy you have presented, again, with no evidences to same, since ample citations are presented with references. After three exchanges with yourself, its obvious you have nothing to contribute to the definition of anatta nor can you intelligently discuss same.</p>
<p>Every time you remove the original section, it will be reposted, until time itself ends. It COULD be removed if you provided ONE shred of logical evidence that it is in anyway incorrect OR the citations untrue, but you are incapable of same, therefore the section stands.</p>
<p>I suggest before you comment again, you give evidences for your baseless claims. The lowest form of arguement is one who makes a 1000 claims with no evidences, something which Gotama called PROFANE (Puthujjana).</p>

<dd>Would you mind posting using your Wikipedia account, Attasarana? Your use of several different numerical addresses suggests that you're morphing in order to prevent people from keeping track of your edits.</dd>
<dd>So far Attasarana's quoted sources have consisted of Caroline Rhys Davids, who is not reliable on matters of interpretation, and someone named "Govind Pande Chandre", who otherwise seems to be only quoted on Attasarana's own site. Attasarana has also claimed support, without quoting as far as I have seen, from Horner and Nakamura. In addition (s)he's named a number of Hindu partisans and Western fans of the esoteric (of rather dubious character) who have no claim to expertise on Buddhism at all and are certainly not scholars. Against this we have noted Buddhist scholars such as Maurice Walshe, Nyanatiloka, Walpola Rahula, Nyanamoli Thera, Nyanaponika Thera, and many others.</dd>
<dd>As I have said, I have no objection to a proportionally sized paragraph describing objections to the anatta-doctrine. But the whole bag and baggage of Attasarana's personally-designed "Presecular Buddhism" does not belong on Wikipedia. I should add that calling oneself "S.A. Buddhologist", repeatedly using ALL CAPS, and making demonstrably wrong statements about the Pali language and translations, is not an approach calculated to convincing others of one's expertise (anatta <i>is</i> used as a noun in the Nikayas; Natth'attā does not mean "no-soul" but "there is no self"; puthujjana does not mean "profane" but "an ordinary (uneducated) person").</dd>

I don't claim that you've been disguising your identity as a single editor, but it makes it somewhat more difficult to keep track of your edits.

<p>"Maurice Walshe, Nyanatiloka, Walpola Rahula, Nyanamoli Thera, Nyanaponika Thera" are all Theravada Abhidhamma trained secularists, your reference to them is a biased non-neutral reference.

<dd>This is exactly the point. Attasarana rejects well-accepted Buddhist scholarship and 2500 years of Buddhist commentary. His <a href="http://www.attan.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.attan.com/" rel="nofollow">website</a> claims to be "the only website dedicated to original Buddhism". The only one, of course, because he rejects every other Buddhist sect as erroneous. That makes Attasarana's POV a decidedly minority one. As I've said, it's fine to have a paragraph citing the anti-anatta people like Caroline Rhys Davids and Ananda Coomaraswamy. That's in line with Wikipedia policy on presenting divergent POVs. But "Presecular Buddhism" isn't a sect, it's just Attasarana; and it's totally disproportionate for anti-anatta POV to be dominating an article on anatta.<a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandomCritic_f342.html" title="User:RandomCritic">RandomCritic</a> 15:09, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"demonstrably wrong statements about the Pali language and translations" is another one of your many baseless claims, im afriad, all claims require substantiations. The endless train of baseless claims is not helping your case in the eyes of any and all onlookers.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>You must be able to read Pali and translate same since your entirely convinced X translation is incorrect. Might I ask your credentials as a Pali translator and a reference to any materials you have translated from the Pali into English or otherwise? If, however (as is the obvious case) that you do not read nor can translate Pali, all your claims are not only baseless but hyperbolic and fallacious Sophistry of the worst kind.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You have provided not one iota of doctrinal nor logical substantiations as per the term Anatta.</p>
<p>Your claim that "anatta is used as a noun in the Nikayas" has not ONE citation to back up same, in fact I know ALL 662 occurances of anatta, all are as an Adjective, provide proof the contrary or dont speak at all.</p>
<p>Nattha (there is no) + attan (Nom. Attan- Soul, Atman-Skt). Im afraid your claim as per this is also utterly without substantiation. Natthatta', also is a heresy in Suttana.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I won't claim to be an expert on Pali, since it's a very bad thing to misrepresent one's qualifications. I have studied enough Pali, however, to know the difference between a noun and an adjective, a phrase and a noun, and to know that "is not" is <i>natthi</i> and not <i>nattha</i>. And that in a phrase like <b>Yāvakīvañ-ca, bhikkhave, bhikkhū anattasaññaṃ bhāvessanti</b> "to the extent, O monks, that monks develop knowledge of absence-of-self", anatta can only be a noun and not an adjective, as the construction is exactly parallel to aniccasaññaṃ, asubhasaññaṃ, ādīnavasaññaṃ, pahānasaññaṃ, virāgasaññaṃ, nirodhasaññaṃ ("knowledge of impermanence, impurity, disadvantage, letting-go, absence of desire, cessation"), all of which include nouns. In addition, "a knowledge without self" hardly makes sense in this context.</dd>
<dd>However, this is beside the point. It is not the job of Wikipedia to adjudicate theological arguments, nor is it the job of a Wikipedia editor to evangelize for a particular interpretation. Wikipedia's purpose is to present generally agreed on facts, and where there is a dispute on the nature of the facts, to present them in a proportionate manner that reflects the degree to which the points of view are accepted. If and when Attasarana's POV comes to be widely taught in universities or widely represented in the scholarly literature, it may justify more thorough coverage. But right now, it's "the only website dedicated to original Buddhism" versus thousands of other sources, which is not much of a contest.<a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandomCritic_f342.html" title="User:RandomCritic">RandomCritic</a> 15:09, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is perception (knowledge sañña) of WHAT IS not the Soul (anattasañña). That Adjectival Nat, not a noun. Also, it is: "knowledge of WHAT IS impermanence, WHAT IS impurity, WHAT IS disadvantage, letting-go, absence of desire, cessation, of WHAT IS not the Soul".</p>

<dd>In terms of grammar, btw, you just abandoned your own position and admitted that anatta can be used as a noun. A word that means "What is not self" is a noun, not an adjective. However, this is really beside the point. The question is not the extent of your knowledge of Pali, or grammar in general. The question is the salience and relevance of the POV material you want added to this article.</dd>
<dd>I suggest that instead of spending a lot of time on the talk page that you edit your material to a point where it is acceptable in and of itself. I.e., shorten it to a single paragraph; cut out the evangelizing; and emphasize your sources without intruding your own interpretation. Something like "Some modern scholars have interpreted the term <i>anatta</i>, as used in the Nikayas, in a manner different from mainstream Buddhist sources. For instance, Ananda Coomaraswamy claims...." and then put in quotes.

It is to the Spirit (Skt.

<p>I'm afraid that after five responses now, you have provided no citations, logic, justifications, and substantiations as regards the term anatta. Unless you are capable of backing up your claims as per anatta, then one can only presume your reasons for persistent removal of texts is solely due to a secular agenda, instead of (logically so) attempting to improve or correct any mistakes that may or may not exist in the main body of the text on anatta. No other conclusion can be reached, such that repeated requests upon yourself to justify intelligently your position have not been answered in any way shape or form.</p>

<p>Nettipakaranapali v.86- “anicce niccanti, anattani attati” - “What is anatta is impermanent, what is eternal is the Soul”</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I looked this quote up in the Nettipakaranam, an interesting text I hadn't consulted before. Even allowing for Attasarana's translation of every instance of "atta" as "Soul", this is not even an approximately correct translation, and seems to indicate an ignorance of such basic Pali grammar as the function of case endings. One does not translate Pali by looking words up in a dictionary and rearranging them arbitrarily to match a preconceived scheme.</dd>
<dd>A good deal has been cut out from the Nettipakarana quote; the two phrases cited are not even next to each other in the text, nor in that order. I won't reproduce the whole section because I don't think it's worth my while to insert a lot of IAST characters at present. However, the section it's in is discussing the delusion or corruption (<b>vipallãso</b>) of the unguarded mind, and it says "one is called 'stricken by false views' when one sees impermanence in the impermanent (<b>anicce niccan ti</b>)". It goes on to talk about, as examples of corrupted thinking, misperceptions about the individual: perceiving form originating from the self, or the self having form, or form in the self, or the self in form, and so on for the other skandhas. Then it discusses four occasions, or bases, for corrupted thought: seeing the pure in the impure (<b>asubhe subhan ti</b>), happiness in suffering (<b>dukkhe sukhan ti</b>), self in the selfless (<b>anattani attaa ti</b>) and permanence in the impermanent (<b>anicce niccan ti</b>).</dd>
<dd>In other words, the thrust of this passage is quite the opposite of what Attasarana claims. It also, rather obviously, uses "anatta" as a noun, in locative case.</dd>

<p>I presume your unaware of the fact that the term ANATMAN is used both in the Upanishads and by Samkara. There are, however, no followers of the Upanishads and Samkara however that missunderstand the Neti-Neti (The Atman is not this, not that [Anatman]) contextual ussage of said term. No coincidence exists to the fact that anatta is used in the exact same context in Buddhist sutta as by Samkara himself (Eg. This is not the Soul, nor that).</p>
<p>The only heresy in Buddhist doctrine according to Gotama is: Anguttara Nikaya 2.51 -"anattaya ca attano" - "to [see] Soul in what is not the Soul"</p>
<p>Maybe you could comment upon why the 'realm of Immortality' (amataya dhatuya) is "outside the scope of what is anatta, is gained by the citta (will/mind)"-Majjhima 1.436</p>

<p>Thanks for introducing your “substantiation”, being: self in the selfless (anattani attaa ti). However, the translation is “[falsely seeing] anattani attaa (Soul in what is not the Soul)”. The term anatta is Syn. with anicca and dukkha, its meaning was well known to the Aryasavkas of Gotama.</p>
<p>The adjectival is clear in (anattani attaa ti). In english it is the same; if one were to say “[it is foolish to look for the] Pure in the filthy”. Nat, what IS filthy? Form is filthy, feelings are filthy, perceptions are filthy.</p>
<p>By your great illogical conceptions, Nat, you would presume Buddhism’s main pillar is a “doctrine of [what is] filthy”, or, in this case “doctrine of anatta” (which does not exist in any Pali passage, only in C.E. commentaries). However Nat, the quest for the PURE (vishudiya) is “Gotamas path”- Udana.</p>
<p>Its really hard to know where to start with your ignorances, Nat. By your presumption Buddhism is merely secular Humanism. Like most, you confuse the empirical khandhic self (namo-rupa) of flesh and blood and bone with The Self, the Soul, that “which is most dear (paramo piya)”, which is “the only refuge (attasarana anannasarana”. Nat, you cannot even be spiritual anything and deny the Subjective Self, the Soul; only a Humanist. However Buddhism is the “quest and path of immortality”; "mine is AMATAGAMIMAGGA (path to immortality)".</p>
<p>Nat, use your brain, son. What is impure? What is anatta? What is impermanent? What is dukkha?</p>
<p>Since you dislike any Indian commenting upon Buddhism (you seem to conceive this as a “dirty Hindu sticking his nose into Buddhism”, as if Buddhism itself was the “Anti-Christ” religion to Vedanta!), you might want to read “Self and Non-Self in Early Buddhism” by Perez-Ramon. A doctoral dissertation upon the claims by modern pseudo-Buddhism as evidenced in doctrine. Perez-Ramon is a well acknowledged Pali scholar of acclaim.</p>
<p>It is of great note, Nat, that you believe and uphold strongly the secular Abhidhamma position of Buddhism. One might as well ask why anyone would foremostly praise the words of any Pope before and above that of the Bible. I would like a response, Nat, why your in fact not a truth seeker nor find logical conviction in the fact that if we speak or debate Buddhism, its doctrine is the grounds for verity, not the commentarial views of Buddhaghosa, H.H.D.L, any Lama, Rinpoche, Zen master, etc. The entire basis, as you have said “accepted belief by millions of Buddhists that anatta……”. We might as equally say that “Billions of Catholics believe”. Your fallacious position is attempting to argue X and referencing Y for support of same (i.e. the beliefs and views of 1700+ years of secular “Buddhism” [Buddhism in name only]).</p>
<p>The empirical self is not in question by anyone, son, its fate “is the grave”-Eckhart. Neither Atheist, nor Creationist, nor Buddhist denies the fate of the namo-rupic self of flesh and blood. This is something secular Vajrayana has not taught you. "The Khandhas are what is meant by Anatta"-Khandhavagga-Samyutta. This self (namo-rupa/psycho-physical) is not in question, nobody is in denial of this self composed of the humors of phenomenal existence…That which is in question by the Nihilists is the Self (attan/Atman), or ones Self-nature (svabhava).</p>
<p>"The Lord, the Bhagavat, (buddha) has never taught the unreality of the Soul"- Mahaparinirvana Sutra.</p>
<p>As for Attan; Buddhadatta Mahathera's PALI-ENGLISH DICTIONARY ....page 8.......Atta' [attan]: SOUL "A Dictionary of Pali" by Margaret Cone: Attan (atta): [Sanskrit Atman], The self, the soul, as a permanent unchangeable, autonomous entity; p.70, Pali Text Society.</p>
<p>The very same Pali term Attan is “the only refuge” Dn 2.100. The very same Pali term Attan is called “everlasting” (accutam). The very same Pali term Attan is called eternal (niccam)- SN 1.169</p>
<p>Mahanidesapali 2.235 “niccato sukhato attatoti” Eternal bliss in the Soul</p>
<p>MN 1.141 What do you suppose, followers, if people were carrying off into the Jeta grove bunches of sticks, grasses, branches, and leaves and did with them as they wished or burned them up, would it occur to you: These people are carrying us off, are doing as they please with us, and are burning that which we are? No, indeed not Lord. And how so? Because Lord, none of that is our Soul! Just so followers, what is not who you are, do away with it, when you have made done with that, it will lead to your bliss and welfare for as long as time lasts. What is that which is not who you are? Form, followers, is not who you are, neither are sensations, perceptions, experiences, nor sentience. - S.A.

<dd>Ah, for example, in regard to size of the article
<dl>
<dd>"Articles longer than 12 to 15 printed pages (more than 30 to 35 KB of readable text) take longer to read than the upper limit of the average adult's attention span—20 minutes. An important consideration is that attention span is lower for children, below average intelligence adults, and all those with attention deficit disorders (groups we would like to serve as well).[1] [2] [3] Compounding this is that many of these groups also have a slower reading speed. Once the attention span limit is approached, most readers will start to lose focus and retention of the information begins to become significantly hampered. All but the most determined readers will quit reading once this starts to happen so going over this needs to be justified by the topic."</dd>

This is both common and consistent Via Negativa or Apophasis (talking away) methodology common to both Buddhism and Vedanta, wherein: "The Atman is not this, nor that (neti neti)"-Upanishads. There is no contextual differentiation made in the usage of the adjective anatman by either Gotama the Buddha nor Samkara (founder of Advaita Vedanta), wherein anatta is used to deny and denigrate any and all phenomena as Selfless, as devoid of the “only refuge”-DN 2.100, the Soul (Sanskrit: Atman; Pali: Attan).

<dd>"However no doctrinal citations can be made which uphold the view of much of present-day Buddhism as to the denial of the Self or soul.</dd>
<dd>That the denial of the empirical person or self (This person so-and-so, Bob, Sue, etc.) in Buddhism is not in question, that self "goes to the grave"- Udana; the controversy of current is that regarding the Self or soul and reference to same in Buddhist doctrine as being the basis for 'Immortality' (amata), and the 'Light (dipam) within'. [Dhammapada 147] "Behold! That painted puppet this body, riddled with oozing sores, an erected façade. Diseased heap that fools fancy and swoon over.” Logically so, the denial of the former is not the denial of the later.</dd>
<dd>In many later (secular) sutras, there is provided no confirmation the existence of a self or Atman a concept that was claimed central to many philosophers of his time, however in the oldest texts that exist in Buddhism, the Nikayas, the Buddha did at length affirm to his disciples (aryasavaka) that the "Soul was the only refuge, was the light within" [DN 2.100], and said the "Soul was that which was most beloved" (atta' paramo piya). Rather than directing his listeners to discover Atman, he taught that all clinging to concepts and ideas of a self are faulty and based on ignorance. The Buddha's teaching was apophatic and was not aimed at any concept of self created by birth, imagination, speculation, metaphysical study or through self-ideation. The five aggregates of form, feelings, perceptions, mental fabrications and consciousness were described as especially misleading, since they form the basis for an individual's clinging or aversion. He taught that once a monk renounces his clinging for all the five aggregates, through meditative insight, he realizes the bliss of non-clinging, and abides in wisdom. The Buddha clearly stated that all five aggregates are impermanent, just as the burning flame is inconstant in one sense, and that knowledge or wisdom is all that remains, just as the only thing constant about a flame is its fuel, or purpose.</dd>
<dd>Controversially, there has been and continues to be a minority of Mahayana Buddhists who understand the Buddhist doctrine of "non-Self" ("anatta"/"anatman") as relating solely to the ephemeral elements (the five "skandhas") of the being and not to the hidden and undying "Buddha-Principle" ("Buddha-nature") taught by the Mahayana Buddha to exist within the deeps of each person's mind (see section on "Anatman and the Tathagatagarbha Sutras" below)."</dd>

<p>"Buddhist teaching tells us that all empirical life is impermanent and in a constant state of flux, and that any entity that exists does so only in dependence on the conditions of its arising, which are non-eternal. Therefore, any Self-concept (attanuditthi) sense one might have of an abiding Self or a soul is regarded as a misapprehension; since the conceptualization of the Self or soul is just that, and not an ontological apprehension of same."</p>

<p>For buddhism, it is motive/intention which is carried to next life. So there is no paradox. If you think there is a paradox, you can present it as such as long as you have verifiable reference.

<p>"Some Buddhists take the position that the basic problem of explaining how "I" can die and be reborn is, philosophically speaking, no more problematic than how "I" can be the "same" person I was a few moments ago. There is no more or less ultimacy, for Buddhists, between the identity I have with my self of two minutes ago and the identity I have with the self of two lives ago. A further difficulty with the anatta doctrine is that it contradicts the notion of a path of practise. Anatta followed to its logical extremities rejects the reality of a Buddhist practitioner able to detach him/herself from clinging."</p>

<p>Though reference to these two sutras may be valid wikipedia entries, the current content appear to be an original-research interpretation of these two sutras. Words like "distinctive" or "remarkable" or "controvercial" isn't really appropriate.

<li>Have restored the informative "Anatman in TG Sutras" section.. This wholesale and imperious wiping out of a whole valid article section, on ludicrous grounds - and also of another section, on the Nikayas, by another editor - is totally unacceptable.

<dd>I agree with Tony's restoring this section. Looking over it, I think it is informative and not particularly POV—that is, it attributes its POV to the Nirvana Sutra, where it belongs. Vapour, if you have some kind of knowledge that this interpretation of the Nirvana Sutra is far outside the mainstream, or that our description of it here is otherwise flawed, please provide citations to that effect. As for its language, I think "controversial" is probably quite right, "distinctive" is hypothetically questionable but seems fine in this context, and "remarkable" is perhaps a bit too much of an opinion to fit Wikipedia style.</dd>

<dd>The Attanasara material, I think, is a lot more problematic that this Tathagatagarbha material, because the former contains much more strident statements dismissing other conceptions of Buddhism. Also, there has been some question from RandomCritic above about the translations that Attarasana uses, whereas I don't think anyone has ever cast aspersions on the translations of MPNS used by Tony. - <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Krause</a><sup>(<a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">Talk!</a>)</sup> 00:38, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have looked carefully through the "Attasarana" material as dispassionately as I can. Overall, it is my impression that the article is reasonably NPOV as it provides citations for each point of the argument which can thus be verified -- indeed more citations, from secondary sources, could be also added -- although this POV is probably unfamiliar to some people here due to their limited familiarity with bona fide specialist research (Tillman Vetter, Alex Wayman, Lambert Schmidthausen come to mind). Some editors may not like the content, but Attasarana does accurately reproduce Nikayan material which corroborates the view that the Buddha of the Nikayas only used "anatta" in the sense that Attasarana relates. However, there may be the occasional use of language that is not NPOV, but this can be easily rectified without junking or compromising the whole article. My main area of concern is focussed on the last 5 paragraphs of the article as it stands today. Of those paragraphs, my feeling is that the 5th from last needs to be re-worded, the 4th from last needs to have the opening sentences re-worded, the 3rd from last needs to be re-worded to a more neutral POV, the 2nd from last is OK by me, and I suggest cutting or re-wording the final paragraph to a bare statement of facts. The manner in which a certain user has taken it upon himself, as we have seen so frequently in other contexts, to cut out this and the following article is quite unacceptable. To me it suggests censorship and immaturity.--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Hodge_12b2.html" title="User:Stephen Hodge">Stephen Hodge</a> 03:13, 16 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think the "Original Research" business is a red herring. There should be no problem with introducing relevant texts from the Pali Canon or any other Buddhist scripture that bear on the question of no-self and self. This isn't original research, but source-based research, which is a good part of Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>However, Attasarana uses bad translations (routinely reading every instance of "atta" as "the Self", when its normal meaning is simply as a reflexive pronoun "myself, himself, oneself") or even entirely false translations, where the supposed meaning bears no relationship to the content of the Pali quoted (see several examples above). This is not "accurately reproduce[ing] Nikayana material". I have been forced to conclude that, despite his claims of scholarship, Attasarana does not know any Pali grammar at all. Furthermore, his quotations are wrapped up in a matrix of presupposition and slant which -- while it has had some support in the past from some (not all) Hindu scholars, and a few (by now <i>very</i> few) Western scholars, and some more Western occultists with no expertise at all -- is not supported by any Buddhist school, past or present.</dd>
<dd>Attasarana's text is interpretation, and moreover a very personal interpretation, which is pretty much the definition of POV. The gist of his interpretation is that, despite repeated statements in Buddhist texts that "everything is anatta" (without self), there can still be posited a lasting, Vedanta-like Atman. The problem with this is that there is no place whatsoever in the Nikayas where the Buddha teaches such a doctrine, which makes interleaving it through Buddhist doctrines look like an attempt to force a slant on the material. The only thing Attasarana has got going for him and his position, really, is that he indefatigably restores his POV text and that he is uninterested in any sort of compromise, such as a shorter text that summarizes his basic position (which really could be done in two sentences).</dd>
<dd>The primary aim of this article is to present the <i>Buddhist</i> concept of anatta/anatman. That means that Buddhist commentaries and Buddhist scholarship are going to be our primary guides to the meaning of anatta. This article is linked to from several other articles on Buddhism. People come to this article not seeking to answer the question "how does one person reconstruct Buddhism-as-it-ought-to-have-been in his own, very personal view" but rather "what does anatta mean to Buddhists and how do they use the term? When Buddhists talk about anatta, what do they mean?"</dd>
<dd>I don't deny that views critical of the Buddhist view can have a place in the article. If someone claims that Buddhists are misinterpreting what the Buddha taught, that can be stated. But it should not be the main thrust of the article -- first and foremost, the obligation is to present what Buddhists mean by anatta. <i>After</i> that, critical views can be aired. However, given that they have a very subordinate position in contemporary scholarship, they should not take up too much space. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandomCritic_f342.html" title="User:RandomCritic">RandomCritic</a> 16:31, 17 June 2006 (UTC)

"[I]t provides citations for each point of the argument which can thus be verified -- indeed more citations, from secondary sources, could be also added" This is by definition NPOV, unverified and original research. I can, for example, argue by citing bible that homosexuality is a sin in Christianity/Judaism. Even so, edit like this is inherently NPOV, original research and unverified argument. From wikipedia point of view, secondary sources is what it count. If quotes are long, one may summarise or describe the source material, but one should never never argue in wikipedia article.

As of the main Buddhism article, I have no objection about you raising verification requirement. Go ahead. Aside from Doctirne and Middle Way part, that article is pretty much broken so I don't really care. I actually appreciate if you can reduce the size. That article has POV cancer. It keep multiplying no matter what. Large portion of my edits have survied without policy invokation mainly on the ground that my edit is not regarded as having POV bias. But this is still no excuse if you or anyone else invoke policies. Anyway, the first rule of Wikipedia is that there are no rule. Second rule of wikipedia is that when someone invoke rules, forget the first rule. Attasarana, on the other hand, is basically a POV vandal because he refuse to make argument based on policies. At this point, he even refuse to debate at all in regard to his revert. Quality of his original research has no relevance in this regard. <a href="../../../v/a/p/User%7EVapour_251e.html" title="User:Vapour">Vapour</a></dd>

Nat, I'll take up your suggestion and delete the word "remarkable" (although I was using it in the sense of "worthy of note" - rather than in the sense of "amazing"). I can see that this adjective can easily convey the wrong impression here. Re. Attasarana's major contributions: I share Stephen Hodge's viewpoint that a lot of informative and accurate material is found there and, while judicious pruning may be in order here and there, the whole mass of information should not simply be unceremoniously dumped. This brings me to "Vapour's" intolerant smashing up of other people's work (which has happened on more than one occasion now): I agree with Stephen's view that it is beginning to look like attempts at censorship and is totally unacceptable - especially as some people who contribute to Wikipedia are genuine specialists in the field about which they write (I am not necessarily referring to myself here: Stephen Hodge springs to mind!).

<dd>The status, significance and interpretation of these texts have been subject to fierce debates for centuries by the Gelukpas, the Jonangpas, the Sakyapas, the Nyingmapas in Tibet. They all have major disagreements about these sutras. The same happened in China, beginning with Faxian. I think your problem is that you do not understand the meaning of "distinctive" or "controversial". OED states that "distinctive" is an adjective derived from "distinction". Several definitions are given for "distinction" but that relevent here is "the fact of being different". Anybody with a grain of intelligence can see that the content of these sutras is different to that of other Mahayana or Nikaya sutras. This is not a POV but a fact which you couild ascertain yourself if you spent more time reading the sutras and less time sabotaging other people's work. OED states that "contraversial" is an adjective derived from "contraversy". "Contraversy: 1. disagreement on a matter of opinion; 2. a prolonged argument or dispute, esp. when conducted publicly." This is exactly the situation that describes these sutras as I mention above. Hence this is a verifiable fact, not a POV. If your mastery of English is somewhat deficient, pls go to the Simple English Wikipedia or better still write some stuff for the Japanese Wikipedia -- plenty of scope there for you.--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Hodge_12b2.html" title="User:Stephen Hodge">Stephen Hodge</a> 03:28, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Stephen is right. These Tathagatagarbha sutras have long been controversial. There is even internal evidence within the sutras themselves to indicate that other Buddhists of the time when they were initially being promulgated regarded them as heretical and even of Mara. The irony of the present dispute is that Vapour himself proves the very point he is opposing - by claiming in some of his postings that my Tathagatagarbha contributions are a kind of smuggling-in of Vedanta into Buddhism, whereas I am simply reporting, accurately and faithfully, what those sutras do in fact teach. But for Vapour such teachings are "Vedanta". Thus - Vapour himself proves that these sutras (or more accurately, some of their doctrines) are indeed controversial. It is really extraordinary to me how anyone (coming from an "orthodox" Buddhist position) could claim that such teachings within Buddhism as that of the "sovereign Self" or the "eternal Self" are NOT controversial! I don't believe they should be at all (as I share Attasarana's view that even the Nikayas do not absolutely deny the true Self, by any means). But the sad fact is that the teachings of these sutras on Self and non-Self do tend to stir up a lot of controversy and hence can indeed be fittingly described as "controversial". As Nat has said, this usage here is "quite right". Cheers. From Tony. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyMPNS_78de.html" title="User:TonyMPNS">TonyMPNS</a> 10:09, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

And I'm certainly not using it in that manner - to garner support for my own viewpoint. In fact, I'm trying to be concessionary to the "orthodox" position on anatta! For me, the Tathagatagarbha explanation of non-Self is not inherently controversial in the slightest. The word "controversial" does, however, have a valid communicative point in the context in which I have used it. I am surprised that Vapour feels that using the word "controversial" for these TG doctrines on non-Self/Self is itself controversial!</li>
</ul>
<p>On this very point of the controversial nature of the TG Self/non-Self teachings, and how others apart from myself have also stated this to be the case: here are a couple or three quotes from the books of reputable scholars on the Buddha Nature doctrine and its relation to Emptiness teachings (i.e. non-Self writ large). The first comes from Dr. Shenpen Hookham's <i>The Buddha Within</i> (State University of New York Press, 1991):</p>
<p>"Tathagatagarbha - Buddha Nature - is a central concept of Mahayana Buddhism crucial to all the living practice traditions of Tibetan and Zen Buddhism. Its relationship to the concept of emptiness has been a subject of <b>controversy</b> [my emphasis] for seven hundred years."</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the same book, Dr. Hookham (who is both an Oxford University Ph.D. in Buddhism and a recognised Buddhist lama) speaks of how two different types of person tend to be drawn to Buddhism (the analytical, and the intuitive) and how they will tend to side either with the the Rangtong or Shentong approach to Buddhism respectively. As is well-known by Tibetan Buddhists, the Shentong approach takes its stand on the Tathagatagarbha sutras and insists that they mean what they say in their qualifying/ delimiting of "non-Self" and their advocacy of a true Self or abiding Essence. Dr. Hookham writes:</p>
<p>" ... this division of interest in Buddhism in the West is refelected in the rangtong-Shentong <b>controversy</b> [my emphasis] in the Tibetan tradition." (p. 54).</p>
<p>Another historically renowned Buddhist master, Dolpopa of Tibet, brought down years of controversy upon his head because of his championing of the Tathagatagarbha teachings - his insistence that there is not only "non-Self" but an eternal, real Self. Dr. Cyrus Stearns, in his major book, <i>The Buddha from Dolpo</i> (State University of New York Press, 1999) comments:</p>
<p>"Without question, the teachings and writings of Dolpopa, who was also known as 'The Buddha from Dolpo' ... and 'The Omniscient One from Dolpo Who Embodies the Buddhas of the Three Times' ...contain the most <b>controversial</b> [my emphasis] and stunning ideas ever presented by a great Tibetan Buddhist master. The <b>controversies</b> [my emphasis] that stemmed from his teachings are still very much alive today among Tibetan Buddhists, more than six hundred years after Dolpopa's death." (p. 2).</p>
<p>Those teachings are of course a championing of Tathagatagarbha doctrines on the Self.</p>
<p>There are other authors whom one could quote to support the point that the TG teachings are controversial amongst Buddhists (and always have been) - but I think most Buddhist editors of Wikipedia will not disagree with me that the Tathagatagarbha sutric doctrines on Self and non-Self are indeed a focus of controversy - as we witness at this very moment! So the word "controversial" is quite appropriate in relation to the TG take on "non-Self". Best wishes.

<dd>Since this article is proving so contentious, I am attempting to re-write it so that it retains the information that user Attasarana wishes to convey in a neutral form, cutting out the polemics and verbosity that mar this otherwise useful article. It will need more citations from the Nikayas and from bona fide modern scholars. I shall try and supply the latter, but others might like to help with the former. In this way, I believe the substance of the article can be saved and satisfy reasonable and fair-minded people.

It is obvious that there are plenty of relevant POV which ought to be presented under a section titled "Nikaya Buddhism". More NPOV presentation is firstly to explain how each nikaya schools interpretated aspect of anatta/atman, then move on to Yogacara/Madhyamaka interpretation as well as the idea of Buddha nature which was done within the theoretical framework of orthodox buddhism. If someone want to present POV from verified source that these view are "nihilistic view of modern secular Buddhism which is anti-foundationalist in nature and contrary to the Nikayas, to doctrine" that is fine as long as POV attribution is clear to wikipedia reader. Hey, Bahai interpret Buddha in pretty similar line anyway.

<dd>This is a critique of this section. It is not going to be a complete critique, because I have a limited amount of time to spend on this matter, but I will point out all the places where POV or other misleading or irrelevant writing leaps to my eye. First and foremost, of course, is the claim that the POV represented below is that of "the oldest Buddhist texts, the Nikayas". In fact it is one person's interpretation -- and that a highly controversial one -- of some bits of the Nikayas.</dd>
<dd>I also will note that in many cases the citations given were wrong. In some cases I was able to track down the reference despite the bad citation. In other cases I was not able to. If one is to make an argument based on citations, it is very important that other people be able to doublecheck your claims.

You need to stop misrepresenting yourself as some sort of Pali scholar because you are not. The Upanishads are not mentioned in the Pali Canon. Tevijja (Sanskrit Traividya) has nothing to do with the Upanishads; it means "possessing the three knowledges" -- usually, but not always, referring to knowledge of the three Vedas. This sort of Vedic knowledge is <i>condemned</i> as useless in -- as you might guess -- the Tevijja Sutta (DN 13). There's no indication that the Buddha used the Upanishads at all. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandomCritic_f342.html" title="User:RandomCritic">RandomCritic</a> 03:47, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Of the 662 occurrences of the term Anatta in the Nikayas, its usage is restricted to referring to 22 nouns (forms, feelings, perception, experiences, consciousness, the eye, eye-consciousness, desires, mentation, mental formations, ear, nose, tongue, body, lusts, things unreal, etc.), all phenomenal, as being Selfless (anatta).</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I have not counted all the uses of anatta in the Pali Tipitaka, but I wouldn't accept Attasarana's claim without verification. However, nothing very important hangs on the exact number. It is to be noted, however, that while only all <i>sankhāras</i> (composites) are said to be impermanent and suffering (because Nibbāna is neither impermanent nor suffering), all <i>dhammas</i> are <i>anattā</i> -- and Nibbāna is one of the dhammas. Sabbe dhammā is all-inclusive; it doesn't leave any room for an eternal Atman outside of the dhammas.</dd>

<dd>The Buddha never refers to a Vedantic "Soul", so there is no reason to inject one into the discussion. The "doctrine of anatta" question is a red herring. It is true that "Anatta" does not refer to a specific doctrine in Buddhist texts, but who ever said it did? "Anatta doctrine" is just English shorthand for "a doctrine about anatta". Of course, it is not isolated in Buddhist writings, because it is only one of several teachings; it just happens to be the one that stands out as unusual to Western eyes. However, the statement <i>sabbe dhammā anattā</i> (Dhammapada 279) is stated as clearly as it can be: "Everything is without self". This is what is meant by "Anatta doctrine".</dd>

<dd>The citation should be SN 44.10, or PTS iv 400. The summary is false, and is a good example of Attasarana's poor scholarship in Pali. Natthatta is not a noun for "no soul"; it is simply a statement, "natthi attā" = "oneself does not exist" or "there is no self". This short sutta is very clear as to its meaning: it does not deny anatta at all, but rather affirms it, with the Buddha saying that he cannot affirm the existence of an <i>atta</i> because that is inconsistent with the knowledge (ñā.na) that "all dhammas are without self" (sabbe dhammā anattā). It explains that the Buddha refused to answer negatively when asked whether there was a self or no because he did not want Vacchagotta (the questioner in the sutta) to misconstrue him as saying that there was a self which later became annihilated. This is what "ucchedavāda" means -- it's a doctrine of the destruction of the self, not of the absence of self in the first place. Its opposite is sassatavāda, affirmation of an enduring self, which is what Attasarana appears to be affirming: but the same sutta rebuts sassatavāda just as much as ucchedavāda.</dd>

<p><i>Common throughout Buddhist sutra is the denial of psycho-physical attributes of the mere empirical self to be the Soul, or confused with same. The Buddhist paradigm as regards phenomena is “Na me so atta” (this/these are not my soul), nearly so the most common utterance of Gotama Buddha in the Nikayas, where “na me so atta” = Anatta/Anatman. In sutra, to hold the view that there is “no-Soul” (natthatta) is = to ucchedavada (SN 4.400) [Annihilationism] = natthika (nihilist).</i></p>

<p><i>Teaching the subject of anatta in sutra pertains solely to things phenomenal, which were: “subject to perpetual change; therefore unfit to declare of such things ‘these are mine, these are what I am, that these are my Soul’” [MN 1.232]</i> The one scriptural passage where Gotama is asked by a layperson what the meaning of anatta is as follows: [Samyutta Nikaya 3.196] <i>At one time in Savatthi, the venerable Radha seated himself and asked of the Blessed Lord Buddha: “Anatta, anatta I hear said venerable. What pray tell does Anatta mean?” “Just this Radha, form is not the Soul (anatta), sensations are not the Soul (anatta), perceptions are not the Soul (anatta), assemblages are not the Soul (anatta), consciousness is not the Soul (anatta). Seeing thusly, this is the end of birth, the Brahman life has been fulfilled, what must be done has been done.”</i> <i>The anatta taught in the Nikayas has merely relative value; it is not an absolute one. It does not say simply that the Soul (atta, Atman) has no reality at all, but that certain things (5 aggregates), with which the unlearned man identifies himself, are not the Soul (anatta) and that is why one should grow disgusted with them, become detached from them and be liberated. Since this kind of anatta does not negate the Soul as such, but denies Selfhood to those things that constitute the non-self (anatta), showing them thereby to be empty of any ultimate value and to be repudiated, instead of nullifying the Atman (Soul) doctrine, it in fact complements it.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The five skandhas are supposed to summarize all of the real dharmas which constitute a human being. There is nowhere any assertion of a "self" separate from the five skandhas, as Attasarana claims. The Milindapañha is very clear that there is nothing outside the five skandhas which can be held to constitute a person.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>This doesn't support Attasarana's position. Anatta is not a teaching of the destruction of an existing self. That doesn't mean that it is an affirmation of an existing self either. Attasarana doesn't seem to "get" that there is no assumption of an existing self in the first place.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Attasarana keeps patting himself on the back, but there's very little logic to his argumentation at all. The point, as is made very clear in the Brahmajala and other suttas, is that the Buddha (or early Buddhists) were faced with sophistic arguers who would claim that "the self" was the body, the feelings, sensation, or any of a great number of other possible dhammas or aggregates. The Buddhist suttas are anxious to debunk all of these notions. And yet, if -- as Attasarana apparently claims -- the Buddha thought that citta was atman, he could have said "Citta is atman". He did not.</dd>

<dd>For the purposes of Wikipedia, we are very much, however, interested in what the traditional Buddhist teaching on Buddhist subjects has been -- including the views of Nagarjuna, the Dalai Lama, and others. They have at least as much right, and probably considerably more, to represent what the Buddha taught. Who is Attasarana? What are his qualifications? Why, he's a self-proclaimed "Buddhist scholar" who claims to know Pali but doesn't, uses abusive language, deletes material critical of his position, and generally defies Wikipedia conventions and precedents. Why are we supposed to take Attasarana so seriously -- more seriously than 2500 years of Buddhist scholarship?</dd>
<dd>Now I have pointed out that, insofar as Attasarana's views agree with those of Coomaraswamy or Horner or Caroline Rhys Davids, that there can be a paragraph to represent this viewpoint. But this isn't good enough for Attasarana. He isn't content with having his POV presented in a manner commensurate to its importance in scholarship -- and it has some, if only as a bias students of Buddhism can look out for. Instead, Attasarana wants to take over the whole page. It must represent his POV, and his alone, and in addition it must condemn every other Buddhist on this planet. <b>This is not what Wikipedia is for.</b><a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandomCritic_f342.html" title="User:RandomCritic">RandomCritic</a> 03:47, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Hallo Attasarana and RandomCritic. Attasarana is actually correct to quote the <i>Mahaparinirvana Sutra</i> as supporting the understanding of non-Self as relating solely to the skandhas (and not the eternal Tathagata or Self). Also, the MPNS is held in highest regard and quoted with full approbation by the Jonangpas of Tibet, the Shinnyo-en school of Japan, the Jodo Shinshu school, the Nyingma School, the Kagyu School, the Nichiren School ... Furthermore, Attasarana is correct to say that the <i>Lankavatara</i> Sutra (in its probably oldest section, the <i>Sagathakam</i>) forcibly expresses the reality of Self and castigates those who reject it. This position is also common - the norm - in the Tathagatagarbha sutras, which essentially support much of Attasarana's position on a non-absolutist interpretation of anatman. The <i>Mahabheriharaka Sutra</i>, for instance, says that "at the time one becomes a Tathagata, a Buddha, he is in nirvana, and is referred to as 'permanent', "steadfast', 'calm', 'eternal', and 'Self' (atman)". Attasarana's view is indeed unpopular amongst most Buddhists, but it has strong support from the Buddha himself in the Mahayana! All the best.

<dd>There is no affirmation of the existence of a permanent self. The point of denying "self" in several different things is to exhaust the supply of possible realities to which "self" can refer. If nothing real is left to be "self", then "self" has no referent at all.</dd>

<p><i>Those interested parties to Buddhism incapable of pouring through endless piles of Buddhist doctrine have defacto accepted the notion of a “Doctrine of anatta” as key to Buddhism itself, when in fact there exists not one citation of this concept in either the Digha, Majjhima, Samyutta, Anguttara, or Khuddaka Nikayas. Unless evoking a fallacy, we must stick strictly to sutra as reference, wherein the usage of anatta never falls outside of the parameter of merely denying Self or Soul to the profane and transitory phenomena of temporal and samsaric life which is “subject to arising and passing”, and which is most certain not (AN) our Soul (ATTA). Certainly the most simple philosophical logic would lead anyone to conclude that no part of this frail body is “my Self, is That which I am”, is “not my Soul”, of which Gotama the Buddha was wholeheartedly in agreement that no part of it was the Soul, i.e. was in fact anatta.</i></p>

<dd>This is all highly biased argumentation. I'll again point out that the five skandhas include, in intention, every aspect of mind as well as body, and leave no place for an Atman, immaterial or material. Just as much to the point, no such Atman is ever claimed to exist in the Pali Canon.</dd>

Stephen Hodge, I’m afraid to state the obvious that user Random Critic is a typical secularist blind to countless 1000s of scriptural passages as pertains original Buddhism. Not a truth-seeker himself, his mission is to guard his incorrect, secular, and illogical views of Buddhism. Like the Catholic Church, which is nothing Jesus taught (Catholicism), that is often accused of protecting in secret and destroying Gnostic-like manuscripts and gospels, Buddhism too has this breed amongst its rank and file.</p>

<dd>Attasarana, this is <i>ad hominem</i> nonsense and completely false to boot. Flinging around insults is not going to gain you respect as a contributor to Wikipedia. If this is the tack you wish to take, there is no point in trying to rebut you point by point. But until you are willing to respect Wikipedia for what it is (and that is not a platform for your private views), you are going to find yourself unable to make a lasting contribution. There is no room for "all-or-nothing". There's room for some sort of presentation of your views, and if you agree to engage in temperate discussion -- don't misrepresent yourself -- cite your real sources -- and generally respect other people, you might be able to get a considerable part of it included in some fashion. However, if you continue to be abusive and confrontational, things are going to turn out differently. Ultimately, this article is too important to be abandoned to your private crusade, and it will be fixed up sooner or later. The question you have to answer is whether you want to be a part of that or not.<a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandomCritic_f342.html" title="User:RandomCritic">RandomCritic</a> 03:47, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Random Critic, in debate, has been proven that he is unaware and adverse to the fact all religious debates are Sola Scriptura (In Doctrine) and unceasingly refuses to refer to same to support his unsubstantiated claims as pertains Buddhist doctrine.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Random Critics' position is identical to that of Theravada and most of Mahayana to wit the denial of all things other than 6: the 5-khandhas and agnosis (avijja); as such this is merely nothing more than Materialist-Humanism, wherein, thru the denial of ones Subjective Nature (Svabhava-Atman), all that is left is a compassion-based Humanistic Nihilism.</p>
<p>Surely the "light-within (dipam)"-Dn 2.100, and "Immortality (amata)"-Sn 5.9, has no place in what is concurrently passed off to the general public as "the teachings of the Buddha". One might as well deny Christ in Christianity as to remove the "only refuge", the Soul from the doctrine of Buddhism; whether illogical or non-doctrinal, the center doesn’t hold for a Liberation (vimutta) ontology such as Buddhism to espouse such nonsense.</p>

<p>How Dhammapada commentary explains Dhammmapada #279 Tattha sabbe dhamma’ti pañcakkhandha’ eva adhippeta’</p>
<p>Dhammapada Att. 3.407 “’Sabbe dharmas are the five aggregates in meaning”</p>
<p>Theravada has used as its last defense for 1500 years now, the “sabbe dhamma anatta” defense to ‘prove’ that all is ‘void’ of a Soul in Buddhist doctrine, or that there cannot be a Soul whatsoever, for as they say “all Dharmas” encompasses everything in entirety. The Theravada say this phrase found in the Dhammapada (and other locations) means in translation “All Dharmas are Soulless”. However, in fact, under close examination the Theravada view falls apart very quickly and their self-created dogma disappears under close scrutiny. Here ends the “sabbe dhamma anatta” debate.</p>
<p>Dhammmapada #279 Phrase dissected Dhammapada #279 “Sabbe dhamma’ anatta'” sabbe (noun [see SN 4.15 below], direct object, in accusative. Sabba is nominative, ‘the ‘all’) The ‘all’partakes of the Soul; however the Soul does not partake of, is not in, the ‘‘all’. Sabbe Dharmas are not the Soul (anatta). Sabba is described as the “five aggregates” in the Pali commentary to this passage.</p>
<p>dhamma’ (proper noun, plural, subject, undeclined in nominative, dharmas)</p>
<p>anatta' (adjective, modifying sabba. An [is not] atta' [attan: Soul]; Buddhadatta Mahathera's Pali-English Dictionary; page 8: Atta' [attan]: soul.). ‘all’ 275 occurrences of anatta' in sutta are adjectival, never as a noun in standalone but rather modifying a noun in negation to its correlation to being identifiable with the Attan.</p>
<p>Sabba in standalone This single passage below at Samyutta 4.28 shows that Dhamma is not the crux of the infamous "sabbe dhamma’ anatta", but rather sabba. SN 4.28 “sabbam., bhikkhave, anatta" The ‘‘all’, bhikkhus, are not the Soul. SN 4.21 “sabbam., bhikkhave, addhabhu'tam" Bhikkhus, the ‘all’are afflictions. SN 4.19 “sabbam., bhikkhave, a'dittam." Bhikkhus, the ‘all’are ablaze.</p>
<p>Elaboration with proofs</p>
<p>SN 4.15-29 is the full explanation of the meaning of sabba. It is abundantly clear without debate that sabba is indeed the psychophysical phenomena or the ‘the ‘all’. The absurd notion that sabba is an adjective modifying Dhamma is impossible.</p>
<p>Firstly Dhamma is in the nominative plural; secondly sabba is the standalone accusative direct object in the cases directly above, namely SN 4.28, which proves that Dhamma is not the direct object of anatta'.</p>
<p>Anatta is the adjective in this sentence as it must be in ‘all’ 662 of its occurrences in the Nikayas. It is incorrect to say that "‘all’ Dhammas are noself" or some other such sectarian concoction. Dhamma is in the nominative plural in agreement with sabba, not in the accusative, which would be "dhammam." or plural accusative "dhamme" sabba (nominative) is the direct object of anatta' which is why it occurs as sabbe (accusative plural).</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As you correctly point out, anattā is used here as an adjective. It is not a verb or a verbal derivative. It cannot, therefore, take a direct object. <b>Sabbe dhammā anattā</b> is a series of three masculine nominative plural nouns, forming a copular sentence without an overt "be" verb. There is no other possible reading. That <b>sabbe</b> takes the pronominal endings, including masculine nominative plural in -e, is a fact known by any student of Pali. But not by you. And you advertise yourself as a Pali scholar? <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandomCritic_f342.html" title="User:RandomCritic">RandomCritic</a> 05:04, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Dhamma is not the direct object of this sentence but rather the subject. One cannot know the meaning of this three-word phrase, which occurs 17 times in Sutta without knowing sabba's meaning at Samyutta Nikaya book 4 verse 15. The sectarian dogma that has grown around this three-word phrase is not found nor can it be attributed to these passages based upon Sutta, context, nor SN 4.15; but only on much later nihilistic slanted commentary. Dhamma in this three word phrase, as Dhammapada #277 and #278 show, is interchangeable with sankha’ra’.</p>
<p>Completely in line with the Sabbe sutta at SN 4.15, sabbe is "‘the ‘all’". This is shown above and below at the Dhammapada that the 17 occurrences of “sabbe dhamma’ anatta'” are occasioned by san.kha'ra' (phenomena). Sabba’s meaning is not "‘all’" nor the adjective of this phrase, that is reserved for anatta'. It has been falsely believed by many that Dhamma is the direct object of the sentence given its location of the middle in the phrase, but this is incorrect since it is undeclined and sabba in its many other occurrences above show in fact that sabba is the crux of what is anatta, afflictions, and ablaze.</p>
<p>One might think Khandhas (skhandas), are the conventional term for ‘the ‘all’, but in actu’all’y khandhas means "mass" or "collection" and do not always carry negative connotation in Sutta as it pertains to the "five khadhas". The "five heaps" is a much more accurate translation for khandha. Khandha is also used in context pertaining to Gotama Buddhas' teachings as khandhas, or "collection/mass of doctrine". Khandha implies "masses", whereas sabba implies "matter/ ‘the ‘all’", especi’all’y sensory related matter; sabba: Lat. solidus &amp; soldus "solid". Both mass (khandha) and matter (sabba) are encompassed by the term san.kha'ra' (phenomena).</p>
<p>Dhammapada 277. “Sabbe san.kha'ra' anicca'”ti, yada' pan'n'a'ya passati; atha nibbindati dukkhe, esa maggo visuddhiya'. ‘The ‘all’ phenomena are impermanent; when this is seen by means of wisdom, one becomes disgusted with suffering. This is the path of clarity. 278. “Sabbe san.kha'ra' dukkha'”ti, yada' pan'n'a'ya passati; atha nibbindati dukkhe, esa maggo visuddhiya'. ‘The ‘all’ phenomena are suffering; when this is seen by means of wisdom, one becomes disgusted with suffering. This is the path of clarity. 279. “Sabbe dhamma' anatta'”ti, yada' pan'n'a'ya passati; atha nibbindati dukkhe, esa maggo visuddhiya'. ‘The ‘all’ dharmas are not the Soul; when this is seen by means of wisdom, one becomes disgusted with suffering. This is the path of clarity. The above three passages show certainly that Dhamma’ is taking a different meaning than standard implication of “power/doctrine/Sa’sana” and is replaceable with sankha’ra’ in this context. It is even highly plausible that sankha’ra’ was replaced with dhamma’ by the redactors to imply something Buddhism does not teach.</p>
<p>Other occurances of Sabba in Sutta SN 2.125 sabbe san.kha’ra’ netam. mama nesohamasmi na meso atta’ti ‘The ‘all’ phenomena are not me, are not who I am, are not my Soul. SN 3.43 sabbe san.kha’ra’ anicca’ dukkha’ viparin.a’madhamma’ti ‘The ‘all’ phenomena are not everlasting, suffering are dhammas in flux. AN 1.32 sabbe te dhamma’ anit.t.ha’ya ‘The ‘all’ dharmas are not fixed</p>
<p>SN 4.15 Sabbasuttam. The Sabba Sutta At Savatthi. Bhikkhus, I will teach you on sabba (‘the ‘all’)! Pray listen closely. And what, bhikkhus, is sabba? The eye and its corresponding forms, the ear and its corresponding sounds, the nose and its corresponding smells, the tongue and its corresponding tastes, the body and its corresponding sensations, the intellect and its corresponding dhamma. This, O' bhikkhus, is c’all’ed sabba.</p>
<p>Whosoever, bhikkhus, should proclaim thusly: "Having abandoned these ‘the ‘all’ (sabba), I sh’all’ manifest different set of ‘the ‘all’ (sabba)"-that surely would be only mere (foolish) presumption on his part. If he were questioned on this matter he would only reap his own vexation. How so? It would be utterly outside his abilities to talk about this.</p>
<p>Here ends the Theravada fallacy that Sabbe dhamma' anatta means "All Dharmas are Selfless". The Theravada and other will use any possible crowbar in its failed attempt to turn Buddhism into a Soul denying Nihilism.</p>
