<p>The article tells you image editing techniques, but it doesn't specify which program to use. Example: sections "Anaglyphs from monochrome images" and "Anaglyphs containing color information". Pjacobi is right, those links don't contain much information for inclusion in an encylopedia article. Gyro666 1:29 December 21, 2005 (EST)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding the specification of a program for analglph construction: I wrote the original content for these sections and constructed several of the example images using Photoshop, but this is not a generally available program for casual use and so thought it was not appropriate to be too specific. The information presented is already stretching the "Wikipedia is not a how-to manual" rule a bit and I did not want some deletionist targeting it. If interested parties would like to assist with a Wikibook concerning thechniques I would be glad to contribute. I have not used Photoshop Elements (often free with scanner or printer purchase). Perhaps someone who has can tell me if this can perform the channel separations necessary. I would think that any program that allows extraction of individual chanels from the images and their recomposition into a single image would be adequate for this task. - <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeonard_G._0170.html" title="User:Leonard G.">Leonard G.</a> 04:36, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Importance of "Compatible" color anaglyph technology seems to elude to contributors to this page. Anachrome, is uniquely suitable for posting as 3D, but also provides a reasonably good 2D image for those not having glasses. Thousands of "anachrome compliant" images are posted on line by scientific and goverment sponsored sites like: 3dparks.wr.usgs.gov/. NASA/JPL includes Anachrome on their short 3D glasses vendor list. Google "Directory" shows, www.anachrome.com to be the #3 "most popular" 3D releated sites online, after only www.stereoscopy.com,&amp; the official site of the Nat. Stereoscopic Assoc. The intemperate insults shown by&#160;:<a href="../../../p/j/a/User%7EPjacobi_dff5.html" title="User:Pjacobi">Pjacobi</a> suggests a lot about that individual , in my opinion. I suggest User:Pjacobi may not be actually experienced enough professional work in this "arcane" subject to write Wiki articles about it.(assuming he wrote a good part of this article.)3D technique is not "cut and dried". various practicianers have varying levels of skill and equipment at their disposal. Anaglyph is becoming a professional skill. as is 2D to 3D conversion...not just a hobby.Nativeborncal 22:10, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are both right. The link is not the kind of link spam we typically get, the kind which results in some of us having a short fuse when commercial links are concerned. Some of the images offered on the anachrome web site are nothing short of amazing – at least compared to the samples our own article offers. Nativeborncal is clearly knowlegeable in this area; he made valuable contributions to this article (even though he tends to get carried away by his enthusiasm) and donated some moderately useful images to WP. It wouldn't be fair to lump Nativeborncal together with the scum that tries to get a free ride. On the other hand, the anachrome website is awful. Not only is it ugly, it seems also cleverly designed to confuse the visitor (FWIW, the tutorial is <a href="http://www.anachrome.com/tutorial.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.anachrome.com/tutorial.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>). Also, it is clearly commercial (even though what exactly they are selling takes a while to figure out as well). Then again, we do have many undisputed commercial links to major vendors of all kinds of stuff. It is quite possible that anachrome glasses are special enough to deserve a separate section, but the web site doesn't seem to offer any specific information. <a href="http://www.anachrome.com/whm-gre.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.anachrome.com/whm-gre.htm" rel="nofollow">This page</a> is tasteful web design without blatant advertising, but it's only a demonstration page for a real site. – What we seem to be lacking is unbiased people that know enough to provide a basic structure that the more biased experts can fill with their knowledge without killing NPOV. I can understand your frustration, Nativeborncal, but you seem to be too involved to write an encyclopedic article all by yourself (that's true for most of us in our areas of expertise), so you need to find a way to work with others, whether or not they not much less than you do.</dd>
<dd>I'll close my rambling with questions:
<ol>
<li>Where is this NASA/JPL shortlist of 3D glasses?</li>
<li>How come all the anaglyphs I ever saw in magazines are red/green rather than red/blue? I would have thought cyan/magenta would be much easier to print accurately in a standard printing environment, so what's the advantage of red/green?</li>
<li>How come the anaglyph software/webcam external links have survived that long? Now <i>those</i> are commercial links that add nothing of value to an encyclopedia.</li>

<p>This paragraph seems to be patent nonsense. The anaglyph displayed on the right seems like a perfectly normal red/cyan anaglyph, and neither more modern, nor less blurry than other angalyphs. I suggest it gets revised or removed. <a href="../../../r/%C5%8D/n/User%7ER%C5%8Dnin_0ae1.html" title="User:Rōnin">Rōnin</a> 23:59, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In fact forget that, I just removed it. I looked at the site, and it features completely normal anaglyphs. The paragraph is probably nonsense. <a href="../../../r/%C5%8D/n/User%7ER%C5%8Dnin_0ae1.html" title="User:Rōnin">Rōnin</a> 00:01, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I just discovered some informative text about the so-called "compatible" anaglyphs in the <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stereoscopy.html" title="Stereoscopy">Stereoscopy</a> article, so the talk about compatible anaglyphs wasn't nonsense as such, though I think we could do without an entire paragraph to showcase photos from the USGS. Perhaps we could discuss this on the Stereoscopy talk page and steal that particular section? After all, descriptions of specific anaglyph types belong here rather than there. Here's what it says:</p>
<p>Anachrome "compatible" method</p>
<p>A recent variation on the anaglyph technique is called "Anachrome method" [2]. This approach is an attempt to provide images that look fairly normal without glasses as 2D images to be "compatible" for posting in conventional websites or magazines. The 3D effect is generally more subtle, as the images are shot with a narrower stereo base, (the distance between the camera lenses). Pains are taken to adjust for a better overlay fit of the two images, which are layered one on top of another. Only a few pixels of non-registration give the depth cues. The range of color is perhaps three times wider in Anachrome due to the deliberate passage of a small amount of the red information through the cyan filter. Warmer tones can be boosted,and this provides warmer skin tones and vividness.</p>
<p>Plastic glasses frequently have better contrast and much better focus through the red filter, due to the 250 nanometer difference in the wave lengths of the red-cyan filters. With paper glasses, the red filter is blurry when viewing a close computer screen or printed image. Plastic glasses can offer a compensating diopter power to equalize the red filter focus shift relative to the cyan. Only molded plastic glasses can provide this focus fix. As of January 2006, more than 3,000 educational, or scientific images were offered on-line in this and similar "compatible" formats.</p>

<p>Popularity of 3D movies and actual method used in the 50's</p>
<p>The fact of the popularity of 3D in the 1950s is indisputable. For example, a huge picture of a theater audience, all wearing 3d glasses appeard on the cover of LIFE magazine in the period. This was very mainstream and trendy. Self-serving, recent promoters of polarized film viewing are presently trying to create the REVISIONIST idea that the original 3D success was based on inferior anaglyph technology...so as to make their modern use of polarized 3D a "FALSE INOVATION". This reference is a good excercise in "DEBUNKING" commercially motivated historical revisionism. The two writers mentioned have indepently made the same clarification in their books and articles.<a href="../../../3/d/n/User%7E3dnatureguy.html" title="User:3dnatureguy">3dnatureguy</a> 18:40, 26 August 2006 (UTC) "Using color images, replace the red channel of the right-eye image with the red channel of the left-eye image. Here's how: select the entire right eye image (if the original is a crossed eye stereogram this will be on the left) and make a new document. Paste the right eye image in. Move the selection to the left eye image (with consideration as above for crossed eye stereograms) and using the channels dialog select the red channel. Copy the red channel from this source image. Select the new document and select the red channel. Paste the left eye image into the red channel. Depending upon the colors this..." - this paragraph is counter intuitive. Can anyone write it in simpler words please?</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Talk%7EAnaglyph_image_1149.html" title="Edit section: Depth adjustment">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Depth adjustment</span></h2>
<p>The caption for the second NASA image in this section includes the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This follows the rule for a red left eye filter when distant objects are beyond the image plane: RRR-Red to Right Receding in the image as it appears without wearing the filters."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The caption makes it sound like a well-known rule-of-thumb is being cited. However, I cannot find "Red to Right Receding" appearing on any other web site regarding the subject. Furthermore, this rule is misleading in that it only applies for imagery where the foreground is <em>darker</em> than the background. For imagery where a light subject appears on a dark background, receding aspects of the subject will have the red channel appearing to the <em>left</em> of the cyan channel when viewed without filters.</p>
<p>I believe this section of the caption should be removed or revised. I am not an expert on this subject; what do those more learned than myself think? Jamieson630 17:58, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
