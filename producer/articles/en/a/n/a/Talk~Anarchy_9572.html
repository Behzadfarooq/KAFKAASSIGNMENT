<p>There should be a side note next to the part that talks about "anarcho-capitalism" since most anarchists reject it as a form of anarchism. "Anarcho"-capitalism is still a very controversial movement and as such is still not widely accepted as "anarchism". <a href="../../../f/u/l/User%7EFull_Shunyata_bffa.html" title="User:Full Shunyata">Full Shunyata</a> 06:45, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Indeed I've found only anarcho-capitalists themselves associate their ideology with the anarchist movement. Anarchism has always been anti-capitalist by nature. 194.251.240.116 19:15, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>Anarchism has always been anti-capitalist by nature.</i> -Rubbish, you obviously have not read many anarchist authors. There are property anarchist writers going back to the 18th Cent. Only from the late 19th cent. anarchists went marxist, and when they tried to put into practice their teachings (in the spanish civil war for ex.), it soon became clear they were more socialist than anarchist.</p>

<dd>It is rather stubbish. Since 'anarchy' is such a nebulous concept (have fun trying to define it in any meaningful way), I think the only real way a place like Wikipedia can talk about it is from a historical perspective, summarizing whatever movements in the past declared themselves 'anarchistic'. Right now the article doesn't say much of anything. <a href="../../../m/g/l/User%7EMGlosenger_94bf.html" title="User:MGlosenger">MGlosenger</a> 22:53, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Most of the article deals with anarchism, which has <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">its own page</a>. I moved this to an Ideology section. I also adjusted the lead to deal with anarchies, rather than the ideology behind them.

<dd>Cultural anthropology isn't much of a science, since it's impossible to employ the scientific method on a culture. But if you're looking for verifiable sources, look to page 26 of <i><a href="../../../f/r/a/Fragments_of_an_Anarchist_Anthropology_f256.html" title="Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology">Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology</a></i> <a href="http://www.prickly-paradigm.com/paradigm14.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.prickly-paradigm.com/paradigm14.pdf" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, written by <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Graeber_bb8f.html" title="David Graeber">David Graeber</a>, a highly-regarded anthropologist. He lists several societies that he would consider anarchies, including the Piaroa, the <a href="../../../t/i/v/Tiv.html" title="Tiv">Tiv</a>, and the people of rural Malagasy (of whom he is widely considered an expert). He also notes that Joanna Overing describes the Piaroan people as anarchist. Overing is an ethnologist, and one of the foremost researchers on the Piaroa.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for the fact the Piaroa have chiefs, this is true, but irrelevant as regarding the structure of their society. As Graeber says in his text, "In Amazonian (or North American) societies the institution of the chief played the same role on a political level: the position was so demanding, and so little rewarding, so hedged about by safeguards, that there was no way for power-hungry individuals to do much with it. Amazonians might not have literally whacked off the ruler’s head every few years, but it’s not an entirely inappropriate metaphor." A chief might seem like a position of authority, but if a chief has no power (in the sociological sense), then the chief is no more a "ruler" of the society than is a potter or child. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Owen</a> 07:45, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Thanks for the reply, first off. There's two things I'd like you to clarify: 1)What is Graeber's criteria for an anarchy? 2) If the chief has no power whatsoever over the society, then why does he exist? 3) What happens when one of the Piaroa decides they want to do something capitalist, like start a trading shop that charges money?--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 15:55, 27 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>He doesn't state explicitly, but does seem to require both a relative egalitarianism and consensus-based decision making, with a lack of formal political institutions. He also does not provide any details on what the purpose of a tribe's chief was (and more than likely, it would vary based on the group). My own supposition is that chiefs primarily interpret the best course of action through traditional precedent or spiritual beliefs rather than enforcing their own will directly on the group. As a result their political power is reduced to that of a judge. Regarding your last question, Graeber's impression is that capitalism would not arise in an a society such as that of the Piaroa because "anarchistic societies are no more unaware of human capacities for greed or vainglory than modern Americans are unaware of human capacities for envy, gluttony, or sloth; they would just find them equally unappealing as the basis for their civilization. In fact, they see these phenomena as moral dangers so dire they end up organizing much of their social life around containing them" (24). <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Owen</a> 09:22, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Once again, thanks for the informative reply. It would be good to get some quotes from him or other anarchists defining what they see as an anarchy. It seems to me unlikely, though, that any people, be they Piaroa or Nigerian or Canadian wouldn't have some bad apples. What happens to someone that is an individual in a way that the tribe doesn't accept? If the social fabric has never been tested in such a way, then how is it possible to know the extent of freedom enjoyed? Grabaer says in regard to negative qualities "they would just find them equally unappealing as the basis for their civilization." But what if a given <i>individual</i> decides to act in such a way. Surely, a free society would allow for bad apples as well as good ones..?</p>
<p>As far as anthropology being unscientific, I think it can get pretty scientific at times. It's difficult to consider Graeber's work scientific, though, since he refuses to posit a concrete definition of "anarchy." His theories are authoritative to the degree that people respect him in the academic community... they're in no way falsifiable. They would be falsifiable, I think, if he laid out the terms and explained why the Piaroa, for example, fall under a given definition for anarchy. Why does he refuse to posit such a definition?--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 20:39, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As far as I know - and I'm not very knowledgeable regarding Graeber - he doesn't refuse to; he more simply doesn't feel the need to. As for individuals detracting from what is socially acceptable - in small societies, it becomes less likely. Being raised in a society in which such actions are reprehensible, people are conditioned from birth to abhor those actions. The accuracy of this is disputable depending on your general views of anthropology - it is certainly not falsifiable - but it does explain how a society like the Piaroa continue to exist. -<span style="font: small-caps 14px times;"><b><a href="../../../s/w/i/User%7ESwitChar_b02e.html" title="User:SwitChar"><font color="#FF0000">Swi</font><font color="#000000">tch</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/w/i/User_talk%7ESwitChar_3e09.html" title="User talk:SwitChar"><font color="#005500">t</font></a></sup></b></span> 08:39, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Right, this is his basic position. Anarchistic societies are organized in such a way that it is in people's best interests to act as communitarians. Labor is divided in such a fashion that each individual relies on every other individual, and it is in each's best interests to work for the benefit of the group, in contrast to say, American society, where it is in each's best interest to work for their own individual interest. So even if you did have a hypothetical "bad apple" in Piaroan society, they would find that acting in their own best interests means acting in the best interests of the larger group. In anarchistic society working simply for yourself means not having what you need to survive, because one individual cannot easily do everything they need to survive. There would be no benefit in trying to do so. This is in contrast to American society, where people are forced into competition by a lack of other options; you can't be a "good apple" because it's inconsistent with the economic model.</dd>
<dd>Like many anthropologists, Graeber does not subscribe to <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sociological_positivism.html" title="Sociological positivism">social positivism</a>, and therefore it is awkward to claim he does not take concrete positions. He is a <a href="../../../q/u/a/Qualitative_research.html" title="Qualitative research">qualitative researcher</a>, and his focus is therefore on detailing rather than on making incontrovertible conclusions. He didn't <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operationalization.html" title="Operationalization">operationalize</a> "anarchy" because he's more concerned with explaining how societies work and less with making rigid claims regarding them. Descriptive anthropology is not supposed to be taken as fact; it's just meant as a way to make sense of a culture. He and others choose to use the word "anarchistic" to describe some societies, just as some would choose to describe the United States as "individualistic" or Korea as "collectivistic". He isn't saying the Piaroa are factually anarchistic; he's just using the term because it seems to be a very fitting description. He also doesn't claim that the Piaroa or any other culture is a perfect anarchy; he actually states on several occasions that they are not, even going so far as to say that "they contain with them the seeds of their own destruction." <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Owen</a> 09:36, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>Anarchy has had a great run in Africa recently, especially in rural areas of countries where there's fighting in the capital. Does anyone oppose me adding this obvious assertion, that several anarchies exist in Africa, and have resulted in death and disease? If Graeber's scholarly opinion was enough to warrant the possibility that anarchies exist, couldn't the dozens of scholars who have refered to large parts of Africa as anarchies be considered as well?

<dd>Actually, that would depend on how those scholars are using the term "anarchy". If they're using it as synonymous with "anomie" and "chaos" then their opinions are not of any relevance to this article, which is about anarchy in the sense of anarchistic society rather than the common pejorative meaning of the term. I would also add that the Graeber text I have been referring to isn't intended as a rigorous piece; although published through the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Chicago_Press_005d.html" title="University of Chicago Press">University of Chicago Press</a>, they set a series of guidelines intended to aid readability. They even prohibited the use of citing references. And in describing the Piaroans as anarchists he was making no great leap, considering the leading researcher on those people described them that way herself. Likely she did so in a more rigorous and convincing way, as it was for a peer-reviewed scholarly journal. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Owen</a> 21:21, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Owen said: <i>Right. "Anarchy" in the sense of "no government", rather than anarchy in the sense advocated by anarchists. Anarchists don't want a vacuum of control; they want to replace government with free association and consensus models of governance.</i></p>
<p>There's not actual consensus among anarchists of what government should be like. Aside from being stateless "there is no single defining position that all anarchists hold, and those considered anarchists at best share a certain family resemblance." (Oxford Companion of Philosophy). Somalia didn't go against some essential anarchist ideal as Owen suggests-- anarchists only agree on the statelessness issue.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that nowhere in my edits does it claim that Somalia was an anarchy. It says "according to the BBC" its government was an anarchy-- that's a source for <i>the claim</i> that Somalia represents an anarchy. If certain anarchist theorists and idealists disagree with the BBC's claim, or the definition that led to it, then go ahead and add sources that demonstrate their POV on anarchy. Frymaster made some intresting points in sharing his opinion above-- if he could get a secondary source to demonstrate his view, I think that would really be towards the betterment of the article.</p>
<p>The Oxford Companion of Philosophy says that statelessness is the only constant of anarchist ideology. Don't say "you're wrong, Urthogie." From now on, say that Oxford is wrong. And prove it if you think so. Follow wikipedia policy in discussing this, and stop telling me I'm trolling, when I'm actually putting in a serious effort to better the article. To claim that I'm not making a serious argument here is both illogical and disrespectful. Try to actually assume good faith here, Owen, instead of reverting me the second you read this.</p>
<p>I'm willing to hear sources, and I'm ready to be <i>proven</i> wrong. Obviously those who edit this page are going to tend towards anarchism, and I respect that given the subject matter. All that I ask is that you stop reverting my edits for a second and actually discuss my point person to person respectfully, with sources and with reason. I'm seriously outnumbered in my views in regard to this article, so it's not like I can "pull a fast one" here-- it's in my interest (and yours) to create a long-term consensus.

<dd>The problem is that both you and that article are using the term anarchy in its everyday meaning rather than its meaning as used by anarchists. I'm sorry if my changes to the article seem rushed, but leaving the article in the state that you did is an embarrassment to Wikipedia's integrity. There's a reason that "anarchy" is a disambiguation; the term is often misrepresented, and you are confusing anarchy as used by anarchists and anarchy as used by non-anarchists. You have yet to provide a source that anarchists support the condition in Somalia, and until you do so, you have not justified your changes to the page. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Owen</a> 23:04, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Of course the anarchists don't celebrate the condition in Somalia. It's a complete failure, and accepting it would be like an advocate of complete state control celebrating a genocidal dictatorship. That's why no anarchists want to call it their own-- even though it is, by their own definition. And also, Sarge, I'm not using the normative every day definition-- I cited the Oxford Companion of Philosophy to prove this.

<dd>You're mixing up two definitions. The header of the article says this is about the anarchist society. Obviously Somalia is not an example of an anarchist society because as you readily admit, no anarchist would possibly support it. Somalia's "anarchy" is not anarchy in the sense used by anarchists, because anarchists are not nihilists. They believe in <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spontaneous_order.html" title="Spontaneous order">spontaneous order</a>, without the need for a state. They don't believe in <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anomie.html" title="Anomie">anomie</a> or <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaos.html" title="Chaos">chaos</a>, or in a vacuum of control. I have provided a different Oxford dictionary to make this point. This article isn't about stateless societies, it's about anarchist societies. If you want to switch that around, that's one suggestion. But mixing them together in one article is highly misleading. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Owen</a> 23:22, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ok, this is awful logic right from the very first few sentences. Just because an anarchist doesn't support an anarchy doesn't mean it's not an anarchy. Noone supports it because it's utter shit. An anarchy that resulted in utter shit. And it falls under the philosophical definition of anarchy, not just the normative. Noone believes in chaos, of course, and I'm not saying they do. I'm saying that chaos results from this anarchy-- anarchy as in statelessness, the one accepted definition even on a philosophical level. So no, I'm not mixing the definitions together, you're using faulty reason. You're assuming that what anarchists talk about has the potential of making anarchies dissapear in a poof of writing and talking. I say that's bullshit, and so does the Oxford Companion of Philosophy if you'd acctually address it's non-normative definition.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 23:34, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You seem to be under the mistaken impression that anarchists are naive, and think of anarchy as inevitable with the fall of the state. This is not true, and that's why every large-scale anarchist movement has advocated non-governmental alternatives to ensure stability in the absence of the state. Otherwise you're left with simply a vacuum of disorder and chaos. Any anarchist could have told you that would happen. Somalia is a stateless society, but it's a vacuum; it's not filled in with anarchist ideals, and therefore it is not an anarchist society. I might also remind you that taking two sources and matching them up to make a point is not acceptable practice on Wikipedia. You need a source saying that Somalia represents an anarchist society; simply matching Somalia up against your own definition of anarchy (sourced or otherwise) represents <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Owen</a> 23:48, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not saying anarchists are naive. I could care less about what anarchists think about Somalia-- anarchists don't suddenly make Somalia not an anarchy by not supporting the (lack of) order there. Somalia was still an anarchy. A shitty anarchy. An anarchist saying "I would have done it differently" doesn't change that. And an anarchist saying "That wasn't a <b>true</b> anarchy <i>is just a reflection of their individual view-- anarchists only agree on one thing: statelessness. And that happens to also be the normative and philosophical definition of an anarchy.</i>
<dl>
<dd>What do anarchists actually believe in, other than opposition to the state? The mutualist tradition was concerned with <i>equity</i>. Anarcho-capitalists believe in at least the <i>quid pro quo</i>. Other forms of anarchism have even more elaborate sets of values associated with them.

Both of these definitions, though, are encyclopedic in some way. And they are both represented by the same word: anarchy. I'm offering a compromise, an end to this debate-- that we cover both forms and specify both forms. Do you want to accept this reasonable offer to specify our definitions and address both, or do you want to keep arguing that the first one shouldn't honestly be in an article about "anarchy"? Who are you to say that only anarchist movements define anarchies? Who are you to say we can't discuss both meanings?--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 03:23, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I just disagree they should be listed at the same page. Anarchy as a social condition is not the same thing as anarchist society. Listing them both at the same page would be a mess because anarchists use the term "anarchy" in a positive sense and others use the term in a pejorative sense. Moving what's presently here to anarchist community and creating a new article here for anarchy in the other sense would be fine by me. But I dispute that there is any "middle ground" between the two definitions. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Owen</a> 03:28, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The problem I have with seperating them is the degree of overlap. Definition 1 (Stateless) includes all of Definition 2. Don't you agree that a complete split ignores the overlap here? What if Anarchy was a page that defined both and there was also a {{<a href="../../../m/a/i/Template%7EMain_f8c0.html" title="Template:Main">main</a>}} for the section on anarchist community.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 03:32, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't see them as overlapping. The first term doesn't even refer to the society itself; it refers to the <i>state</i> of the society. In fact, it's not clear whether we need an article for anarchy as used in that sense, since it's already covered at <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anomie.html" title="Anomie">anomie</a>. In fact, if you re-read that BBC article, it says nothing about Somalia being "an anarchy". That's because it's grammatically incorrect. So if there is going to be an article on anarchy like you suggest, it needs to focus on the "state of disorder due to lack of government or control" rather than on "stateless societies". The latter isn't a proper use of the word anarchy. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Owen</a> 03:40, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It doesn't "define" anarchy as a stateless society, it's just talking about the first time anarchy was used in the sense of a stateless society. It's saying the first time it was used in the sense of definition #2 on that Oxford dictionary page. It's disambiguating between what I mean by anarchy and the #1 definition of anarchy most people use. It's like saying "the first time orange was used to describe a fruit..." It's not defining orange as "a fruit", it's simply disambiguating between the use of the word "orange" for fruit and the use of the word "orange" for color. But anyway, I need to run.

<p>Ok Sarge. Explain how the following is not a contradiction:</p>
<p>Urthogie says: "2. The first definition of anarchy is the stateless society."</p>
<p>Sarge says: "<b>there is no definition of anarchy as a stateless society.</b> "</p>
<p>Sarge says: "It's disambiguating between what I mean by anarchy and <b>the #1 definition of anarchy most people use.</b>"</p>
<p>How can they use it if it doesn't exist (if there is no definition of that sort)? Furthermore, how can you say the definition #1 refers only to chaos. The article I linked to specifically seperates the "stateless society" from the chaos that is associated with it, if you actually read the first two paragraphs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The word <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchy.html" title="Anarchy">“anarchy,” describing a state-less society</a>, was for the first time used by Louis Armand de Lahontan in his Nouveaux voyages dans l'Amérique septentrionale (1703), describing the Indians living in a society without state, laws, prisons, priests, private property, in short, “in anarchy.” <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anomie.html" title="Anomie">Colloquially <i>however</i>, anarchy became identical with confusion and disorder.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole article I linked to is about <b>stateless societies</b> as <i>first</i> referred to by Louis Armand de Lahontan. The definition exists, and has been in use <i>since</i> 1703. Now there are scholarly articles devoted to the discussion of it, that <b>seperate it from <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anomie.html" title="Anomie">anomie</a></b> (see above quote).

<dd>I agree with Libertatia here. The first paragraph sets this up to be a page specifically about anarchy as built on the principles of anarchism. And just because you have a source that says statelessness is all it is does not mean that we can't provide numerous sources that say otherwise. Just read the archives of the talk page for <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a>--this debate is years old here on wikipedia. Most anarchists would disagree that it's merely statelessness and if any mention of Somalia is to be made it must be clearly differentiated from anarchism as advocated by anarchists. Also, as for <a href="http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhi.cgi?id=dv1-12" class="external text" title="http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhi.cgi?id=dv1-12" rel="nofollow">this source</a>, it says in the first paragraph that <i>Essential for anarchist thought, however, is the rejection of all coercive authority exercised by men over men.</i> A chaotic society in which competing gangs try to one-up each other is clearly not free of coercive authority.

<dd>Yes, anarchist thought is associated with anarchies (stateless societies) that are supposed to work. However, an anarchy is defined simply as a stateless society. So that's why Somalia is never an ideal in anarchist thought-- it's not the right type of anarchy.

<dd>Perhaps it will come as a surprise to you to find that a single word can have multiple meanings. You are correct that it is not the "right type of anarchy." It is not the type of anarchy currently being discussed in this article at all. If you said that a sloppy soccer game was a "bad game of football," you would have some chance of being correct, but if you said it in the middle of the NFL wrap-up show, it would be pretty obvious you have confused the games. Here, you have confused the games. You are criticizing apples as oranges. Etc. <b>A Question:</b> If there were a separate article, or partition of this article dealing with "anarchy" simply as "lack of established order," without reference to anarchist movements or ideologies, your material on Somalia (and other instances of state collapse) could be placed there. Would that satisfy you? Or is it your intention to <i>insist</i> that "anarchy" as failure of government is the same as the failure of an anarchist project? <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 19:40, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This article's first sentence says "Anarchy (Greek: αναρχία) refers to a society <i>founded on the principles of anarchism</i>" (emphasis added).

<dd>Well, that's what everyone has been saying, isn't it? The article deals with one definition, and you are trying to add information that refers to another definition.</dd>
<dd>As for previous arguments, that the only principle all anarchists hold is support for abolition of the state and therefore any society without a state is anarchist is faulty logic. What if the only single principle all anarchists hold is abolition of the state, but all anarchists <i>also</i> support (just for example) <i>one of</i> communism <i>or</i> absolute pacifism (This is hypothetical)? You would have to support either communism or absolute pacifism to be an anarchist. Somalia was neither, so it would not be anarchist by that definition. This is similar to what your own sources say: All anarchist societies are opposed to coercive authority (this is true). All anarchist societies are stateless, but not all stateless societies are anarchist.

<p>Here's my argument summarized, as I can't respond to so many users at once above.</p>
<p>We emerge with 3 main definitions of anarchy:</p>
<ol>
<li>anomie</li>
<li>stateless society (to prove Somalia fit this definition, we'd have to prove that it was at one point stateless, a fact which noone on this page disputes.)</li>
<li>anarchist society (all anarchist societies are stateless, have spontaneous order, supported by anarchist ideology, etc.)</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>The word “anarchy,” describing a state-less society, was for the first time used by Louis Armand de Lahontan in his Nouveaux voyages dans l'Amérique septentrionale (1703), describing the Indians living in a society without state, laws, prisons, priests, private property, in short, “in anarchy.” Colloquially however, anarchy became identical with confusion and disorder.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that to say that a stateless society is the same as anomie is countered by secondary sources. Therefore, this argument can't be taken as fact-- it's a(n) (false) opinion.</p>
<p>My argument is that definitions 2 and 3 are what should be discussed in this article. Number 1 already has <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anomie.html" title="Anomie">its own article</a>.

<dd>You still haven't worked this out in a coherent fashion. There is, by the way, an <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchy_in_Somalia_0ab8.html" title="Anarchy in Somalia">Anarchy in Somalia</a> article which you might want to be involved with. There are even anarcho-capitalists out there who are arguing that things were <i>pretty good</i> in stateless Somalia. But our problem here remains that it is necessary to keep distinct (at the very least) those "anarchies" which result simply from the absense or failure of a state and those which are related to the various positive projects of anarchism. As the article stands right now, there is not a framework for that separation. Your initial approach suggests that you would perhaps not be satisfied to simply "discuss" the two categories without attempting to make the first appear somehow illustrative of the second. As "statelessness" appears to be a necessary condition of your categories 2 and 3, it would be possible to restructure the article to discuss <i>mere statelessness</i>, and then discuss anarchist projects, carefully noting the other necessary qualities (present in nearly all anarchisms, however varied they might be) that differentiate class 3 from 2. I think class 2 will ultimately break down into classes of failed states and pre-state societies, and perhaps further beyond that, before there is a coherent schema. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 23:29, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Why would you suggest we can't coherently discuss both definitions 2 and 3? They are both complex, encyclopedic topics, and both definitions are used a lot by secondary sources. Why are you anarchist editors allowed to abritrarily state that we'll only deal with definition 3, when the same word is used both ways, which (as has been noted) are different from <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anomie.html" title="Anomie">anomie</a>..--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 01:10, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I believe that I just <i>suggested</i> that we talk about "both 2 and 3," although I have reservations about the approach you have presented. As for "arbitrary statements," it is the case that the article currently discusses 3, and you have just as "arbitrarily" imposed the sense of 2 on it, and in a way which confuses the two senses. Indeed, your initial approach was to conflate 2 and 3. If you have come around to see that that approach was confused and confusing, that's excellent news. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 14:07, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Sarge's version only mentions definition 2 in passing in the lead, and then goes on to only allow discussion of 3. At least with me, who you claim to be POV, you can edit for NPOV. With Sarge's version, you're not even able to discuss both definitions. So why revert to Sarge's version, if not to censor the limits of what the article is able to discuss in the body text? --<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 01:10, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>There are a variety of ways this could be addressed: reorganization, separate entries, etc. You <i>now</i> appear to be willing to deal with the issues of necessary and sufficient conditions for 3, although you have yet to address them directly, so there is <i>some</i> small hope of including 2 here without creating a false picture of 3. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 14:07, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is an ideological response to a logical/factual dilemma, the very sort of thing that has led you to charges of "censorship" and to make snippy comments about "anarchist ideologues." Personally, I would prefer to see some of the duplication in the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchist.html" title="Anarchist">anarchist</a> entries reduced, and would not be particularly to seeing all three definitions of "anarchy" treated here, as long as appropriate separation is maintained. But the taxonomy has to remain clear, and this business of treating mere statelessness as a <i>sufficient</i> condition of 3 either has to be justified or abandoned. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 14:07, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'll reply at more length shortly, but it seems to me that both 2 and 3 are instances of a more general rule, which would also include 1, which is not particularly tied to <i>statelessness</i>. Until the general principle of which 1, 2, and 3 are instances is better presented in the article, it will be hard to organize. Time, I guess, to look at the <i>OED</i> and see if there's a simple organizational solution. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 20:03, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The <i>OED</i> acknowledges two sorts of "anarchy," disorder relating from the interruption or failure of a "supreme power" and a society without government, explicitly described in terms of liberty. It seems sufficient to me to distinguish between <i>anarchy as a product</i> and <i>anarchy as the failure of a project</i>. If we want to keep things narrowed down to the political realm, then "statelessness" is an appropriate lowest common denominator, although "anarchy" (in the sense, I suppose, that we are giving "anomie") doesn't necessarily have anything to do with the state or government. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 21:05, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This completely ignores tribal societies that weren't "mere statelessness" but also weren't "anarchist communities" because they weren't started by anarchists. I think it's ridiculous to claim they were anarchist communities, as that's little more than an appropriation of their social structure by modern-day anarchists. This whole dillema seems to result from the fact that we don't subcategorize "stateless societies" into the following:
<ol>
<li>Tribal anarchies</li>
<li>Anarchies that result from political strife and gangs</li>
<li>Anarchist communiteis/projects</li>

<p>Urthogie, this <i>unilateral</i> restructuring of the article is better than your earlier attempt, but right now there is not anything close to a consensus that such a restructuring is necessary.

<dd>No, you haven't given a definition. I don't even know how you've convinced yourself what you gave is a definition. It only says in passing that the first time anarchy was used in the sense of a stateless society was in 1703. It's not even remotely a definition, because it's simply disambiguating between more than one use of the term anarchy. It's true that an anarchy is a stateless society. But that doesn't mean an anarchy is defined strictly as a stateless society. It's just saying it's one defining characteristic. The only reason why the word "stateless" is used instead of "anarchist" is because anarchism didn't even exist in 1703.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, what you're doing IS original research, according to Wikipedia policy. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Synthesis_of_published_material_serving_to_advance_a_position" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Synthesis_of_published_material_serving_to_advance_a_position" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> . Taking two sources and "logically" putting them together to make a conclusion is forbidden by policy. You can't take a definition of anarchy and a description of Somalia and put them together to say Somalia is an anarchy. You have to find a single source saying Somalia is an anarchy.</dd>
<dd>To be fair, the article itself looks pretty good to me at present, but I would like some actual source claiming Somalia as an anarchy, rather than stringing together sources (which is not permissible). <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Owen</a> 00:05, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Based on your approach I could call anything original research, by challenging dictionary and sourced definitions for every single English word. It would be original research to assume that the word "hello" meant hello. Be reasonable, Sarge! Your argument is centered on arguing over particles like "an" and "is". Even if there was a source that said "Somalia is an anarchy", that could still be vaguely taken several ways, so that google search really doesn't prove anything either way.

<dd>Not <i>an</i> and <i>is</i>. <i>An</i> and <i>in</i>. "In" refers to a condition, e.g. "in anger", "in retribution", "in anomie". "An" refers to an object. Being <i>in</i> anarchy necessarily refers to a condition, and therefore refers to definition #1: a state of disorder due to lack of government or control. Being an anarchy refers to an object, and therefore we use definition #2: a society founded on the principles of anarchism. An anarchy can't even be <i>in</i> anarchy, or it ceases to be an anarchy, since a necessary component of an anarchy is that it operates on spontaneous order. I'm not trying to be "a dick". I just think we need to source things properly. The point of this encyclopedia is to accumulate knowledge from various sources, not to state as fact things that apparently can't be corroborated by anyone. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Owen</a> 00:32, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I find it strange you're questioning my use of English grammar to understand sentences. You pulled a definition out of a sentence completely incorrectly, and somehow continue to feel it is adequate. I provided numerous good sources and you replaced them due to your preference for one that doesn't even validate what you're saying. That sentence doesn't "define" anarchy as a stateless society. If it did, then why doesn't the sentence "The word “orange,” describing a fruit, was for the first time used by..." define orange as a fruit? It's one thing to interpret the meaning of a sentence, it's another to interpret a sentence incorrectly and in contradiction to every other definition. You've edited out the dictionary sources that gave a direct definition of anarchy and replaced them with sources that don't even give a definition of anarchy. This is just ridiculous.

<p>You said: <i>That sentence doesn't "define" anarchy as a stateless society. If it did, then why doesn't the sentence "The word “orange,” describing a fruit, was for the first time used by..." define orange as a fruit?</i> The article goes on to use that definition of stateless society for the rest of the article. Do you think it pointlessly mentions the stateless societies definition as a complete non-sequitor. To take your analogy, if the article goes on to talk about such oranges, then yes, it does show us that the definition is being used. This is basic logic, and these word games are stupid and pointless.</p>
<p>As far as your attempt at using a dictionary, I removed that to save your argument. If we actually went by dictionaries, you'd have no argument whatsoever:</p>

<p><i>Sigh.</i> We've been through this sort of stuff recently, on various of the anarchism-related pages. The current discussion is a <b>giant</b> step backward. In keeping with Wikipedia's scholarly pretensions, I checked the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, which is one of a small handful or genuinely scholarly dictionaries, and, as I reported above, it <i>still</i> presented a <i>zaxlebax</i> (see <a href="../../../d/e/f/Definitional_concerns_in_anarchist_theory.html" title="Definitional concerns in anarchist theory">definitional concerns in anarchist theory</a>) mishmash of disorder in general, disorder resulting from the absence of a "supreme power," and societies characterized by liberty. The second two sub-definitions were given their own sections. <i>If</i> there is some concensus that this article should be about "anarchy" in an inclusive sense, and if we are to follow the most scholarly of dictionaries, then it seems that the logical arrangement for the article would be something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Statement of definition, acknowledging tensions</li>
<li>Treatment of "general disorder," with link to <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anomie.html" title="Anomie">anomie</a></li>
<li>Treatment of "collapse of government" scenarios</li>
<li>Treatment of nongovernmental societies outside political anarchist tradition</li>
<li>Treatment of anarchist societies</li>
</ul>
<p>The last two might switch places in order, depending on how the taxonomy is explained.</p>
<p>A couple more thoughts: Personally, I'm not terribly fond of "tribal anarchies" as a way of describing that category, but can live with it, barring the discovery of some better term. Also, I'm not convinced that treating "anarchist anarchies" as being <i>defined</i> by some spontaneous order is useful, or truly representative of anarchist theory. It seems to me that this disqualifies pretty much every attempt at an "anarchist anarchy" that has been made. There are precedents going back to Proudhon for treating "anarchy" as a limit case ("perpetual desideratum," etc), but I'm not sure we're well served here by adopting that strategy. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 20:07, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you call current Somalia an interregnum, and therefore an anarchy, then at least you should remove the word 'only' in the phrase: "Somalia was the only country in the world without a functioning state." There are a lot of countries in state of civil war, with competing authorities or disfunctioning states.</dd>
<dd>In fact, I think it is highly subjective whether a situation of 'interregnum' can be called a 'stateless' society, as this depends on your definition of state. I have read scholars (for example <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Tilly_710e.html" title="Charles Tilly">Charles Tilly</a>) who would rather say this is a 'revolutionary situation', i.e. a situation in which different authorities/groups/rulers dispute over the control of the state (without wanting to abolish the state),or a situation of competing 'states' (this would imply the competing authorities have a territorial base smaller or elsewhere). I think the last thing is more the case: see also the article <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchy_in_Somalia_0ab8.html" title="Anarchy in Somalia">Anarchy in Somalia</a>. Otherwise one could also say that Somalia is not even a real country nor society, since there is not much of a unity, imagined community or whatsoever.</dd>
<dd>Personally, I think we maybe should delete this article altogether. Maybe make a small redirect page: 'did you mean anarchy as in 'anarchist society', society as wished for by anarchist idealists? did you mean anarchy as in 'anomie', did you just mean 'chaos'? or did you mean anarchy as in 'interregnum' or vacuum of authority?Tamira C. 22:40, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Somalia was not anarchy. It was chaos. Anarchy is a SYSTEM of government, not the absence of it. Thus, the first part of this article is incredibly biased and flawed, as it misstates what anarchy is, mistaking 'no rulers' for 'no government'. I tried to fix this error but the amendment was removed. This is a simple matter of DEFINITION. Anyone can go to a dictionary and find that anarchy does not mean the absence of government. I mean this is why Wikipedia has such a poor reputation, as it lays itself open to abuse and political spin. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.61.21.244_20dd.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.61.21.244">24.61.21.244</a> (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.61.21.244.html" title="User talk:24.61.21.244">talk</a>) 21:01, 18 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<li>In Spanish: it was a definition, stating that anarchy means lack of 'rulers' (not state, archos means rule), explaining the different meanings and the positive and negative connotation of the word. Then saying shortly something about the positive interpretations of the word by anarchists, linking to anarchism, liberty and equality.</li>
<li>In Portuguese: it is a redirect to anarchism.</li>
<li>In German: it states Anarchy is a social political model of organisation in which no domination, no authority and no hierarchy exists, and goes on explaining the anarchist model, with lots of literature-references, and just a late 'see also' anarchism.</li>
<li>In French: I think this is the best article: take a look at it, if you read French: it state like the German, that it refers to no authority, no hierarchy etc. but it also pays attention to the common use of the word as anomie, and to the historical change of the word-use. Maybe someone should translate that part! Tamira C. 00:53, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Wikipedia is a tertiary, unreliable source; even Jimmy Wales, its inventor, tells people not to use it as a reference. So while the anarchy article in other language Wikipedias might be interesting/instructive to compare and contrast, such a comparison can't concretely inform any major decisions (like whether or not to keep it) we make so far as the editing of this article.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 04:32, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Wikipedia's not reliable as a source, but that has zero relevance. We're not using Wikipedia to cite facts or as a reference, we're looking at how other languages deal with this article and following their example if it's better than our current attempt.

<p>I have removed lots of extraneous material and put in a bit from Harrington. It would be useful to restore some of the material about the discussion of Anarchy during the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Revolution_034b.html" title="English Revolution">English Revolution</a>. I feel that this page should concentrate more on how differing people have considered anarchy, rather than overloading it with the minority views of anarcists which quite rightly can be dealt onthe page for <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a>.

<p>I am not sure that anyone has suggested removing anarchists' views on anarchy, however I do not see why anarchist views should be privileged in the discussion.

<dd>It's "obvious," is it? Which anarchists are you talking about, as we are hardly a uniform bunch. Haven't you figured out yet that you are essentially the only person interested in this article as currently structured? Your objections to the edits that <i>have</i> been made would make better sense if this article made sense. But it really doesn't. It is not the duty of anyone to put back in poorly conceived treatments of "Somalian anarchy" with which they do not agree. There are very few anarchists editing the pages that actually pertain to anarchism, so this hand-wringing about how they haven't preserved you pet project is just silly. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 02:02, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The fact is that you didn't even respond to his removal, which was based on a misunderstanding of Summary Style. The article makes sense for the most part, actually. The only thing that confuses it is a bunch of ideological masturbation which has more to do with anarchism than anarchy. Also, it may surprise you but I haven't edited this page for a while (it was even off my watchlist for several weeks). Guess what-- the consensus stayed on my ordering of the sections.

<dd>I think whenever people try to explain what another editor's edits are "based on," they set themselves up for problems. The problem for Aufheben, as I'm reading the note above, is the <b>controversy</b> surrounding the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchy_in_Somalia_0ab8.html" title="Anarchy in Somalia">Anarchy in Somalia</a> article, not any mis/understanding of WikiGuidelines. I have already said my piece about the issue of "anarchy in Somalia," and, despite my feeling that its inclusion reflects a mix of original research and undue weight to not particularly notable sources, I worked here to try to put together an outline that would be inclusive. That doesn't mean that what we came up with is something I'm interested in editing or even maintaining. When you come back and start slinging mud because your edits haven't been defended by the people you're so ready to sling mud at, my interest level raises just a bit, but only in a fairly negative sense. This page is largely stalled, in part because you have pushed your POV about "anarchy" on it, and then apparently just walked away. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 02:56, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, his removal was based on a misunderstanding of Wikipedia guidelines. Controversy does not mean you can remove content on a subject.

<p>these are both anarchies, but neither results from political strife. The collapse of government would lead to an anarchy from poltiical strife, as it did in somalia.

<dd>I have restored them. Yes, Harrington is clearly discussing political strife, as does Nicholas Lawes albeit in a different manner. To meit seems very important to show how the term has been used. I have been trying to find some edits that used to be on the anarchism page about the discussion of anarchy at the Putney debates, which would illustrate how Harrington's remarks resonated more broadly.<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarrypotter_9204.html" title="User:Harrypotter">Harrypotter</a> 09:19, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Diamond does not mention anarchy at all - and in any case, anthropologists, anarchist anthropologists or apologists for that matter should really be deported to the anarchism page. Surely this page is for examples of anarchy not anarchism or anarchist theory.... furthermore, the specific examples cited have no mention of anarchy and all of them have clear social roles and functions in self government. The <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moriori.html" title="Moriori">Moriori</a> peoples on the Chatams had rituals and councils which were meetings designed to to ritually and collectively decide on peaceful resolutions to conflicts and problems. Even the racist eurocentic Diamond aknowledges that. <a href="../../../p/a/k/User%7EPaki.tv_61c5.html" title="User:Paki.tv">Paki.tv</a> 00:41, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I'll ignore this craziness, though, as your main point about it is correct.
