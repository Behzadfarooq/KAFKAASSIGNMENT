<p>The ear of the typical mammal consists of three parts. The <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outer_ear.html" title="Outer ear">outer ear</a> collects sounds like a horn and guides them to the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Eardrum.html" title="Eardrum">eardrum</a>. Vibrations of the drum are conveyed to the <a href="../../../i/n/n/Inner_ear.html" title="Inner ear">inner ear</a> via a system of bones called <a href="../../../o/s/s/Ossicles.html" title="Ossicles">ossicles</a>. These leverage the larger motions of the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Eardrum.html" title="Eardrum">eardrum</a> to the smaller vibrations of the <a href="../../../o/v/a/Oval_window.html" title="Oval window">oval window</a>. This window connects to the <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cochlea.html" title="Cochlea">cochlea</a> which is a long dual channel arrangement consisting of two channels separated by the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basilar_membrane.html" title="Basilar membrane">basilar membrane</a>. The structure, about 36 mm in length, is coiled to conserve space. The <a href="../../../o/v/a/Oval_window.html" title="Oval window">oval window</a> introduces sounds to the upper channel. The lower channel has a <a href="../../../r/o/u/Round_window.html" title="Round window">round window</a> but this is not driven by the bones of the middle ear. The far end of the structure has a hole between the two channels called the <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helicotrema.html" title="Helicotrema">helicotrema</a> that equalizes slowly varying pressures in the two channels. A series of sensory <a href="../../../h/a/i/Hair_cells.html" title="Hair cells">hair cells</a> along the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basilar_membrane.html" title="Basilar membrane">basilar membrane</a> repsond to send neural pulses towards the brain.</p>
<p>Models for the ear of a direct kind have been created, most notably by (Nobel Laureate) <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georg_von_Bekesy_f639.html" title="Georg von Bekesy">Georg von Bekesy</a>. He used glass slides, razor blades, and an elastic membrane to represent the <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helicotrema.html" title="Helicotrema">helicotrema</a>. He could measure vibrations along the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basilar_membrane.html" title="Basilar membrane">basilar membrane</a> in resposne to different excitations frequencies. He found that the pattern of displacements for given frequency sine wave along the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basilar_membrane.html" title="Basilar membrane">basilar membrane</a> rose somewhat gradually to a peak and thereafter fell. High freequencies favored shorter distances from the <a href="../../../o/v/a/Oval_window.html" title="Oval window">oval window</a> than did lower ones. Frequency values approximate a logarithmic distribution with distance.</p>
<p>Detailed discussions of the direct models by <a href="../../../v/o/n/Von_Bekesy_eba0.html" title="Von Bekesy">von Bekesy</a> will be found in his book, "Experiments in Hearing", McGraw-Hill, 1960. Also see his article and others in S. S. Stevens, "Handbook of Experimental Psychology", John Wiley and Sons, 1951. This handbook is singled out as a major source of information on speech and hearing, word recognition, and other topics as well as data on the human ear.</p>
<p>A direct model uses the variables of air and water pressure, fluid velocity and viscosity, and displacement. An analog model uses a different set of variables, namely, voltage and current. The outer and middle parts of the ear can be represented with a collection of coils, capacitors, and an ideal transformer to represent the leveraging effect of the <a href="../../../o/s/s/Ossicles.html" title="Ossicles">ossicles</a>. This circuit terminates with a capacitor representing the oval wndow. From there, the two channels are represented with a sequence of inductors and resistors for fluid flow within each channel with the two channels joined with a sequence of series resonant RLC circuits. Voltages across capacitances represent <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basilar_membrane.html" title="Basilar membrane">basilar membrane</a> displacements. Element values along the cochlea are tapered in a logarithmic fashion to represent lowering frauency sensitivities with distance.</p>
<p>The pattern of voltages along the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basilar_membrane.html" title="Basilar membrane">basilar membrane</a> can be viewed on an oscilloscope. Average values can be obtained with rectification and shown as patterns using a high speed comutator. The analog ear shows patterns that closely follow those observed by <a href="../../../v/o/n/Von_Bekesy_eba0.html" title="Von Bekesy">von Bekesy</a> on his more direct model.</p>
<p>The first relatively complete model was constructed in the early 1960's at the University of Arizona by two graduate students and their faculty mentor with support from the newly estblished Air Force <a href="../../../b/i/o/Bionics.html" title="Bionics">Bionics</a> program. This work was first summarized in a report: "An Electronic Analog of the Ear", Techncial Documentary Report No. AMRL-TDR-63-60, June, 1963, Biophysics Laboratory, 6570-th Aerospece Medical Research Laboratories, Aerospace Medical Division, Air Force Systems Command. The report contains an extensive list of references. The work was also reported at <a href="../../../b/i/o/Bionics.html" title="Bionics">Bionics</a> symposia.</p>
<p>Unlike models based on a series of active filters or represented with digital equations, an analog ear can incorporate nonlinearities that represent nonlinear actions of the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basilar_membrane.html" title="Basilar membrane">basilar membrane</a>, perhaps caused by non-symmetric motions of sensory cells resulting in non-symmtriec motions of the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basilar_membrane.html" title="Basilar membrane">basilar membrane</a>. Difference frequencies could be generated as are observed in the human. Some difference frequencies originating in the cochela can be observed in the <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outer_ear.html" title="Outer ear">outer ear</a>.</p>
<p>Neural signals responding to motions of the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basilar_membrane.html" title="Basilar membrane">basilar membrane</a> show resposnes in one direction as in rectification. At all but low frequencies, the neural measure averages over multiple cycles to give the equivalent of rectification followed by averaging (low-pass filtering). Over the entire <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cochlea.html" title="Cochlea">cochlea</a>, response shows as a pattern that varies more slowly that the applied frequency but that does follow the envelope of the applied signal. Each group of cells can give rise to a semi-periodic wave that can be analyzed by neurons in the brain. The total pattern that arises from a sound can thus be thought of as a two-deminsional pattern in time with one axis being the distance along the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basilar_membrane.html" title="Basilar membrane">basilar_membrane</a> and the other being distance along some squence of neurons. These patterns, varying at rates less than lower audio frequencies, have shapes that can be identified much like patterns in vision. The concept of the neural analyzer as an extension of cochlear patterns is discussed in U. S. patent 3,387,093, "Speech Bandwidth Compression System", June 4, 1968. (Filed in 1964.)</p>
<p>It was found that the analog ear with its asymmetric overlapping bands was more reliable in identifying speech sounds that is a conventional <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frequency_spectrum.html" title="Frequency spectrum">frequency spectrum</a>. The second formant is the most significant single measure. Speech sounds of interest include <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whispered.html" title="Whispered">whispered</a> and clipped speech. See "Speech Processing with A Cochlear-Neural Analog, John L. Stewart, 1967, Technical Documentary Report No. AMRL-TR-66-229. An article published in the journal Behavioral Science studied constraints to sensory discrimiantion imposed by two kinds of neural noise. Considerable information on speeech patterns and recognition is reported by a number of different authors in the "Handbook of Experimental Psychology" referred to above.</p>
<p>Applications were made to animals and insects with appropriate ear models. See "Aural Systems Simulation for Birds and Insects," Robert L. Lucas, John L. Stewart, and Richard A. Schaeffer. Technical Report AFAL-TR-66-12. January, 1966. Another sudy using the analog ear was "Simulating Mechanisms in Animal Echoranging," John L. Stewart and James M. Kasson. Technical Report AMRL-TR-68-194. September, 1969.</p>
<p>Many reports, articles, and patents followed the research as cited in the reports listed here. The last full report employed a relatively early version of a computer program written in time-shared <a href="../../../b/a/s/BASIC_e4ac.html" title="BASIC">BASIC</a>. See "A Theory and Physical Model for Cochlear Mechanics," John L. Stewart. Acta Oto-Laryngologica, Supplement 294, 1972. Parameters of the analog ear and patterns obtained with the computer program are shown. Patterns and parameters given in this report are sufficient to reproduce analog ears.</p>
<p>The research resulting from analog ear studies fueled the creation of special sounds for use in repelling_birds and other pests. Sounds were synthesized to follow natural bird calls but were of a switching kind. The concept is similar to the use of a babble of human voices for jamming another person's communications. The <a href="../../../a/v/-/Av-Alarm_ad8b.html" title="Av-Alarm">Av-Alarm</a> was the principal product. It was also adapted to the transonic and ultrasonic regions with a device called <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transonic.html" title="Transonic">Transonic</a>.</p>
<p>The research also led to development of an early speech word recognizer that operated with 8-bit computers as well as later ones based on 16 bit processors. The product line was developed by Covox, Inc. with product names of Speech Thing and Voice Master. These mames have Trademark status.</p>
<p>A number of U.S. (and foreign) patents on topics related to the analog ear were granted. In the order of filing dates starting in 1962, numbers are 3,294,909, 3,325,597, 3,387,093, 3,432,618, 3,378,700, 3,483,325, 3,459,034, 3,543,138, and 3,510,588. Patent data can be obtained from the patent and trademark office by going to www.uspto.gov.
