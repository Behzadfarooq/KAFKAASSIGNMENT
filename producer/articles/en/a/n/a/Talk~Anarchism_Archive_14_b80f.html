<p>Although the south korean uprising of 1980 is an interesting read, is it actually anarchist?

<p>I agree; there should also be less story-telling (leave that for a main article on the subject) and more discussion of why it is or is not considered an example of anarchism. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Francis_c89a.html" title="User:Sam Francis">Sam Francis</a></p>

<dd>D'Annunzio's life has nothing to do with anarchist history, except for the single time he <a href="../../../g/a/b/Gabriele_D%27Annunzio_31f8.html#Politics" title="Gabriele D'Annunzio">collaborated in writing the Constitution of Fiume</a> with an anarcho-syndicalist. If the article were to mention everyone who had any interaction with anarchists at all, it would be ridiculously long and trivial. In fact, the main article on him states that he mostly added poetic flourishes to the writing which sounds rather trivial to me. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbamuth_eea6.html" title="User:Albamuth">albamuth</a> 21:00, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think this article (or a linked one) could do with some info on how anarchism works among hunter-gatherers and that there still actually are people in the world who are pimarily hunter-gatherers and therefore anarchist and (pretty much) egalitarian.

<dd>Well read it again, and again. Then youll see it clearly says some or most hunter-gatherers tend to be anarchistic and egalitarian. And you here say "No hunter gathereres are egalitarian or anarchistic", well here it has also been pointed at hunter-gathereres in india which clearly are egalitarian and anarchistic, so you are wrong, not all are anarchist and egalitarian, but atleast some are, so saying that No hunter-gathereres are.. is wrong. <a href="../../../f/o/a/User%7EFoant_a5c9.html" title="User:Foant">Foant</a></dd>

<dd>Correction, there ARE and have been hunter-gatherer societies that are or were anarchist. One of the main arguments of anarcho-primitivists is that we should go back to living in hunter-gatherer societies. --<a href="../../../f/a/t/User%7EFatal_5ada.html" title="User:Fatal">Fatal</a> 20:42, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes. Allthough they might not call themselves Anarchist (or even have a word for it), it seems to me that (atleast) some hunter-gatherers are anarchist naturally. They live in small groups where too much authoritarianism on anyones part makes the group split by one or some of it's members joining another group or forming a group of their own. As to real egalitarianism, it seems that women (gatherers) do a more work (and also provide more nutrients to the community), maybe because hunting (which is primarily mens work) has higher status, being considered more cool (and meat perhaps being considered tastier also, in which case ofcourse a mere comparison of nutrients doesn't give the whole truth).

<dd>Well, I don't know much about these cultures actually, but you can't make broad generalizations. Different cultures have different customs and social structures. A related book worth checking out for those interested is David Graeber's <i>Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology</i>. It was released just a few months ago I believe. Kropotkin's 1902 work Mutual Aid also has some ideas on this topic. --<a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETothebarricades.tk_2bb0.html" title="User:Tothebarricades.tk">Tothebarricades.tk</a> 18:40, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Talking about "cultures" is making broad generalizations. Not all representatives of a "culture" share the same knowledge of the "culture" and all representatives of any "culture" are more or less influenced by all sorts of other cultural ... "flows", infact we're all individuals, we're all different (except for that one guy).</dd>
<dd>I do believe you can make broad generalizations about among other things hunter-gatherers. Saying "hunter-gatherers in general are mobile people" is probably true (after a while of hunting-gathering in one area, the things to hunt and gather in that area seem to lessen, which calls for moving to another area). Since they're mobile they don't carry much stuff, which means they don't have much possessions but are pretty equal in the richer/poorer sense. Because hunting-gathering doesn't call for long-term plans or large organizing for the sake of providing food (as opposed to for example agricultural (agrarian?) societies, which calls for longer cycles of work and then storing of food)there is no need of authoritarian institutions that see to it that people remain in the community and are productive members. With more complex societies, it is increasingly important people do not for example plant seeds and then leave the society before harvest, because that would have grave consequences for the other members of society that depend on the farmers providing food for them.</dd>
<dd>However, I'm not saying we necessarily need general explanations of hunter-gatherer lifestyle in this anarchism article, but that it could do with some specific examples of how some societies are organized in ways that correspond with some ideas of anarchism, for example the Paliyans in south India, who are pretty much hunter-gatherers in general (allthough any Paliyan is ofcourse permitted to take a job with some neighbouring plantation or whatever if s/he wants to earn money to buy Coca-Cola or something).</dd>
<dd>I might write about Paliyans after researching them a bit more, but first I'd like to find out more about what other (more or less) hunter-gatherer societies there might be that seem to live life according to more or less anarchistic principles.</dd>
<dd>By the way, I'm not a primitivist. Mikko.O. 08:56, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I dont belive agrarian societies have to be authoritarian. There was agroculture for thousands of years before the first civilizations emerged, they rulers/elites used the agrocultural techniques to rule the people and what not... Just the same as there has been and there are authoritarian hunter-gatherer societies. Altou you might make apoint in that its harder for the a elite class or rulers to emerge in such a society. <a href="../../../f/o/a/User%7EFoant_a5c9.html" title="User:Foant">Foant</a></dd>

<dd>I checked out the series sidebar rules, and the change was correct. Series are done for things that are normally chronological, like the presidents of a country. Footering does indeed apply here. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbamuth_eea6.html" title="User:Albamuth">albamuth</a> 05:43, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay, another thing, I'm not sure how to edit something that on the bottom of all the pages all at once but I have a pretty good suggestion for it. I think that "topics related to..." box at the bottom should also have a link to the "Past and present anarchist communities" which is linked to in the Anarchism article. Since the information's been moved, it would make sense to provide a link to it there. --<a href="../../../f/a/t/User%7EFatal_5ada.html" title="User:Fatal">Fatal</a> 23:38, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
