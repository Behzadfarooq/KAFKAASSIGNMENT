<p>Impressive article. I feel that I should something more to equate to it's grandness, but don't know anything. Good work. And I changed somewhere in the article "socialist comrades" to just "socialists". Many of anarchists of those days had a hard time seeing socialists as comrades and so do I. - Non-Sec</p>

<p>As noted on the <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a> page, this article needed to standardize its capitalization of "Anarchist", "Communist", "Socialist", and "Republican". I attempted to do so using the following criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>Capitalize when referring to <i>specific</i> political parties.</li>
<li>Lowercase when referring to the movement.</li>
<li>Do not adjust caps for quotations.</li>
</ol>
<p>These conventions seem to be standard. (See: <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">communism</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialism.html" title="Socialism">socialism</a>...)

<dd>The book is mostly on the Spanish Civil War, with only peripheral comments about the anarchists. I included it as a decent overview of the war, but it's really more suitable for a "further reading" then "references" section, and I believe its included in the References section on the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Civil_War_7a30.html" title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a> page. --<a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETothebarricades.tk_2bb0.html" title="User:Tothebarricades.tk">Tothebarricades.tk</a> 20:11, 21 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<p>I just reverted the article from this this POV revision:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The previous article was an unacceptable whitewashing of the murder, terrorism, and enslavement perpetrated by the so-called "anarchists" of Spain.</dd>
<dd>Now that I have your attention, a rewrite by those who are <b>not</b> driven mad by their lust for terror and mass-murder would be appreciated.</dd>
<dd>References, further reading <a href="http://www.jim.com/cat/blood.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.jim.com/cat/blood.htm" rel="nofollow">"What really happened in Catalonia</a>, by James Donald.</dd>
<dd><a href="http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/spain.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/spain.htm" rel="nofollow">"The Anarcho-Statists of Spain: An Historical, Economic, and Philosophical Analysis of Spanish Anarchism"</a> by Bryan Caplan.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The links provided offer no convincing evidence. The first link is clearly POV with out-of-context quotations and very general claims. The second is a well-written article though it seems to group every action of the anti-fascist revolution in Spain to be the sole work of the anarchists and is written in highly rhetorial language---</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>None of this implies, of course, that similar atrocities were not committed by the Nationalists and by non-Anarchist forces on the Republican side. It is to be expected that Communists, fascists, and the other bloodthirsty zealots of the 20th century would brutally murder people for their beliefs. One would be surprised if moderate Republicans, moderate Socialists, and moderate monarchists restrained themselves from widespread murder in the midst of a fratricidal civil war. But one would hope that a movement condemning the state for its age-old brutality, and advocating an end to all human domination, would have behaved differently. Instead, it is clear that Anarchist militants were at the vanguard of the murder squads on the Republican side.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>In short, it's a paper written beyond the point of simply clarifying history as it is heavy with it's own agenda.</p>
<p>I recommend that mentions of violence committed by anarchist factions in Spain be included in the article if they were not actions normally committed during wartime but otherwise not worthy of special attention.--<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbamuth_eea6.html" title="User:Albamuth">albamuth</a> 07:49, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think it's made pretty clear in the article that some anarchists committed acts of violence. "Enslavement" and "mass murder" are pretty fantastic claims, though - I've seen them made before, mostly in stalinist/fascist propaganda rags from the time. Anarchist violence was political violence - assassinations, the like and not approved of by all in the movement. --<a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETothebarricades.tk_2bb0.html" title="User:Tothebarricades.tk">Tothebarricades.tk</a> 20:26, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In our attempts to be NPOV, it's appropriate to include links to pages from both sides of a contested issue. See, for example, <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rape_of_Nanking_8f49.html" title="Rape of Nanking">Rape of Nanking</a>, where we link to pages that I personally dislike that attack Iris Chang's book. However, I support leaving them linked (even if the <i>article</i> on Wikipedia does not take their line, as it should not) to allow people to see both sides. The same should be done here. The first page clearly has an axe to grind, but at the same time it's not wholly lunatic - they themselves link to a page which rebuts them (always a good sign), and although you may feel that the quotes are out of context, they are lengthy, not tiny snips which are more prone to mis-interpretation (and always a bad sign). <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 15:56, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

That addition, although improper (it's not in the correct form) was <i>not</i> vandalism. There are few things I find more irritating that bogus claims of people with one POV that the edits of people with an opposing POV are "vandalism". You do get plus points for putting the clip here, though, rather than silently deleting it. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 15:56, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What I added on the todo list might seem a bit vague. People criticized the neutrality of the article in the past when it was nominated for Feautred Article status. What I fear is a line-by-line butchering of the article to include the viewpoints of the opponents of the anarchists at every stage. I think criticisms of anarchism in general are made clear in other articles, so they should not take up space here. I have tried to make the article as neutral as possible without weakening it or slowing it down. Anyone have any thoughts on this issue? --<a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETothebarricades.tk_2bb0.html" title="User:Tothebarricades.tk">Tothebarricades.tk</a> 03:01, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think it needs to be made more neutral. Anarchism doesn't need to be dissed at the end of every paragraph, but it could be made to sound less self-congratulatory. Note that I am not saying this out of some anti-anarchist agenda, since I am a <i>cenetista</i>. I think I might tweak a couple of things. Guerrillero 19:37, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, I am from Spain and I edited this part. By the way, the article is really good. I just wanted to add that part because: 1) it was requested 2) I think that was the main cause for the split 3) Even if it wasn't, it really makes the difference in today's world between the CGT and the CNT and explains the larger size and importance of the CGT. It is clear that CGT has representatives where anarchism has a long tradition, like in Catalonia and in the railroad sector, but I want to point out that their importance is really much smaller compared to the two larger trade unions. The CNT is viewed as more purist and they really criticize the existing industrial relations model and their bureaucracy and bureaucrats. For example, they commonly describe <i>liberados sindicales</i> (workers who don't work because they have been chosen by their colleagues as their representatives) as <i>parasitos sociales</i> (social parasites), a harsh criticism. They are also against the <i>canon sindical</i> (money that workers pay their union to support it) as they view it as yet another way to exploit the worker. Speaking of the problem of what formerly belonged to the CNT and was seized by Franco and has to be given back someday, it seems impossible to do it due to the split. Anyway, not even mery moderate political parties have recovered fully everything they owned. There are many problems and probably lack of political will to do it. Update on this one (today is 11/29/2005): Apparently, the new socialist government has decided to give back to the CNT most of what belonged to them (and not to the CGT, who will get nothing). It has probably done it because it has also given back to the UGT (the socialist trade union) what belonged to them, just in time for the UGT to repay an important credit with this money. I want to point out that the government has given the unions a monetary compensation and not the actual buildings and presses that belonged to the unions. That would be impossible.</p>

<dd>I think there are charts suggesting such in <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_Thomas_593e.html" title="Hugh Thomas">Hugh Thomas</a>'s <i>The Spanish Civil War</i>, a work which is generally indifferent or mildly hostile to the anarchists. In an essay by <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gaston_Leval_eaaa.html" title="Gaston Leval">Gaston Leval</a> from <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Dolgoff_6136.html" title="Sam Dolgoff">Sam Dolgoff</a>'s work on the anarchist collectives: "The collective modernized industry, increased production, turned out better products, and improved public services...Through more efficient cultivation and the use of better fertilizers, production of potatoes increased 50% (three-quarters of the crop was sold to Catalonia in exchange for other commodities ...) and the production of sugar beets and feed for livestock doubled. Previously uncultivated smaller plots of ground were used to plant 400 fruit trees, ... and there were a host of other interesting innovations. Through this use of better machinery and chemical fertilizers and, but no means least, through the introduction of voluntary collective labor, the yield per hectare was 50% greater on collective property than on individually worked land. These examples finally induced many more "individualists" to join the collective." <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Beevor_8d25.html" title="Anthony Beevor">Anthony Beevor</a>'s book <i>The Spanish Civil War</i> praises the collectives, saying something like, they were the most effective and productive units during the war - I'm greatly paraphrasing since I don't have the book with me.

<p>I think this might be an informative point to include, but I'm not sure where or how to put it. I'll leave it to the regulars. To show just how counterrevolutionary the Communist Party had become, the following was a popular campaign slogan:</p>

<p>Well Wexler cites it as being from Broue and Temime (both names have 'french marks over 'e'....I don't know how to make my computer do that), 'The Revolution and Civil War in Spain, pg. 211, as well as Brenan, 'The Spanish Labyrinth', pg. 325.</p>

<p>I just dleted the part where it sail that Pi i Margall claimed that Anarchism was related to federalism during the Civil War. Pi died in 1901, so he was waaaay dead when the Cicil War ocurred. Also, I don't find acurate to describe him as a follower of proudhon, since his first theories on federalism preceded Proudhon's for some years.</p>

These social centers put on events ranging from concerts, community dinners, and workshops to language courses and free internet cafés.</b> They have faced strong opposition from the authorities, including raids and evictions.

<p>I was thinking of making this change to part of the Today section.
