<p>Thai names are indeed a swamp of confusion for ignorant farangs. The problem here is that "Rama" is not a name, it is a description. As I understand it is a contraction of "<b>Ra</b>ja <b>Ma</b>ha," which means "great king" in Sanscrit. Thus, the current king's name is Bhumipol Adulyadej, and he is the ninth Great King (Rama) of the Chakri dynasty. Thus although he is conventionally called "King Rama IX" this is not cognate with "King Louis IX." My prefered article title would be <a href="../../../b/h/u/Bhumipol_Adulyadej%2C_King_of_Thailand_59a0.html" title="Bhumipol Adulyadej, King of Thailand">Bhumipol Adulyadej, King of Thailand</a>. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 11:59, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>For this article, I would prefer <a href="../../../a/n/a/Ananda_Mahidol_of_Thailand_81ca.html" title="Ananda Mahidol of Thailand">Ananda Mahidol of Thailand</a> and for his brother <a href="../../../b/h/u/Bhumipol_Adulyadej_of_Thailand_b652.html" title="Bhumipol Adulyadej of Thailand">Bhumipol Adulyadej of Thailand</a>. --<a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenrygb_9b92.html" title="User:Henrygb">Henrygb</a> 18:32, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have now been given a different version of the meaning of the Rama title. According to this version Rama III became convinced he was a reincarnation or emanation of the god <a href="../../../r/a/m/Rama.html" title="Rama">Rama</a>, and that the whole Chakri dynasty were, too. He therefore retrospectively named the first two Chakris the First and Second Ramas and himself the Third Rama. This is discussed at <a href="../../../r/a/m/Rama_%28King_of_Thailand%29_9f9c.html" title="Rama (King of Thailand)">Rama (King of Thailand)</a>. The current king is therefore the Ninth Rama. This formulation might be better to use than Rama IX, which looks like a European personal name and regnal number. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 05:22, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>My view is still that the title should be <a href="../../../a/n/a/Ananda_Mahidol%2C_King_of_Thailand_4e5c.html" title="Ananda Mahidol, King of Thailand">Ananda Mahidol, King of Thailand</a>. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 13:00, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I have rewritten the section on the king's death. Comments welcome. I am Bangkok for the next few days. If any Thai Wikipedians are about, I would be interested in discussing this and other questions, so feel free to email me (adam@carringbush.net). <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 13:17, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

Name of Rama VIII should be Anandha Mahidol than Ananda Mahidol. --Pudtipong Nawasornyuttana 08:22, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think Ananda Mahidol is right, as d is used for ท and dh is used for ธ. <a href="../../../c/w/3/User%7ECW32_71a4.html" title="User:CW32">CW32</a> 16:55, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Article says the King's pistol "was not nearby" and then in the next paragraph says it was found in his left hand. Confusing.</p>

<p>I posted the following message to the Talk page of the anonymous person who has been editing this article. I have had no reply.</p>
<p>I note the edits you are making to this article, in which you say that Stevenson's book is an unreliable source. I make the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stevenson's book is the only recent account of the king's death in English. We therefore have to rely on it unless we have a better source.</li>
<li>You have not in fact challenged any of the points in Stevenson's account, just added comments to the effect that you don't believe them.</li>
<li>If you think Stevenson's account is wrong, you should say where it is wrong, and why you think this, and cite other sources if you have them.</li>
<li>You are an anonymous user who has a record of vandalism. Why should I take your word over the word of a published author who is a personal friend of the King of Thailand?</li>
<li>I am currently in Luang Prabang and don't have access to my books, so I won't revert your edits now. But I will do so when I get home unless you can show why the current article should be changed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unless the anon editor has some answers to these points, I will revert his edits. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 15:41, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This section seems to do nothing but rehash the contents of a particular book and attempt to smear the name of Pridi Banomyong. There are a number of theories about the death, but there is no evidence that actually connects Pridi Banomyong with his death. There were just rumours spread after the king's death to smear Pridi's name. The more likely cause of the king's death is not something that people want to publish, but documentary evidence implying who was responsible for the death does exist. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidreid_3d1e.html" title="User:Davidreid">Davidreid</a> 04:04, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't believe any fair reading of the section can be seen as a smear on Pridi, or as suggesting that Pridi was behind the King's death. That's not Stevenson's view or mine. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 04:18, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Pardon me if I'm misinterpretting wikipedia reference guidelines, but I think a specific citation should be given to the sentence that refers to the "official explanation" of his death. The article by the Hua Hin Tourist Information Center merely notes a radio announcement on the day of his death, which speculated that the King was playing with his pistol when it accidently went off. I don't think that really qualifies as an "official explanation". <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatiwat_337a.html" title="User:Patiwat">Patiwat</a> 15:39, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>There is no "official explanation" of Ananda's death anywhere, and I can't imagine where this came from. Even the Stevenson book -- which is so full of errors, including the fantasy of Tsuji's role, that is is embarassing that someone here would call it reliable -- even the Stevenson book has the king calling his brother's death a mystery. A far more accurate, reasonable and still incomplete account of the Ananda case is in "Devil's Discus". This "official explanation" is a gross error.</p>
<p>Anonymous comments seldom get considered replies. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 04:07, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>There were two sets of findings that I would technically consider "official". The first was the result of the first trial of the royal pages, which found that the death could not be due to an accident, but didn't find enough grounds to find the pages guilty. The second occured when, soon afterwards, Marshall Plaek staged a coup and ordered a retrial which found the royal pages guilty. Appeals were unsuccessful and the pages were executed. Given the politicized and tainted nature of these trials (especially the second one), I don't think the article should give too much credibility to the official explanation. To me, that sentence about the official explanation has to go. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatiwat_337a.html" title="User:Patiwat">Patiwat</a> 05:00, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
The "Mysterious death" section currently seems a bit unstructured - we've got some good info, but right now it seems mixed up and a bit hard to follow. I'd like to suggest dividing up the curent text (little re-writing neccesary) into some sub-sections: 1) A short introduction, 2) Circumstances of the death - this would describe the events of that day, 3) Aftermath - this would discuss the key investigation results, trial, coup, retrial, and executions, 4) Theories explaining the death. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatiwat_337a.html" title="User:Patiwat">Patiwat</a> 12:46, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The current section is based on Stevenson, which is the only source I had. Mr Anonymous keeps saying that Stevenson is unreliable, but doesn't say exactly why or how. What other source do you have? <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 14:33, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I'd ignore Anon, given that the threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html#Verifiability.2C_not_truth" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiability, not truth</a>. My major issue with Stevenson (and Kruger, too) is that his book was banned in Thailand. Thus, its contents can not be reasonably verified by a Thai reader. This isn't that much of an issue though, because Stevenson's only original contribution to the mystery is the Tsuji Masanobu-hypothesis. Nearly all of his other information (the events of 9 June 2489, reasons why suicide was highly improbable) coincides with the court testimony of the key figures and the forensic analysis of Keith Simpson. Dr. Simpson's book is already cited in the article. Give me a chance to dig around for the court testimony. Any thoughts on the restructuring? <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatiwat_337a.html" title="User:Patiwat">Patiwat</a> 02:34, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I gather the main reason Stevenson is banned in Thailand is not that he is unreliable (it's pretty obvious that his major source for much of the book is the King), but that he calls the King "Lek," which is considered disrespectful. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 02:41, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>"At 9am, Prince Bhumibol visited King Ananda. He said afterwards that he had found the King dozing in his bed. At 9.20am, a single shot rang out from the King's bedroom." This reads as though Bhumibol was with the King when he was killed. I'm assuming he wasn't, or he would know how the King died. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKernow_6302.html" title="User:Kernow">Kernow</a> 00:29, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Many books have been written in Thai concerning the death of King Ananda. Very few of them are available online, and most of them are out of print.
