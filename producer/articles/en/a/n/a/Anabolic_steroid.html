<p><b>Anabolic androgenic steroids</b> are a class of natural and synthetic <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steroid.html" title="Steroid">steroid</a> <a href="../../../h/o/r/Hormone.html" title="Hormone">hormones</a> that promote cell growth and division, resulting in growth of several types of tissues, especially muscle and bone. Different anabolic androgenic steroids have varying combinations of <a href="../../../a/n/d/Androgen.html" title="Androgen">androgenic</a> <i>and</i> <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anabolism.html" title="Anabolism">anabolic</a> properties, and are often referred to in medical texts as AAS (anabolic/androgenic steroids). <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anabolism.html" title="Anabolism">Anabolism</a> is the metabolic process that builds larger molecules from smaller ones.</p>
<p>Anabolic steroids were first discovered in the early 1930s and have since been used for numerous medical purposes including stimulation of bone growth, <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appetite.html" title="Appetite">appetite</a>, <a href="../../../p/u/b/Puberty.html" title="Puberty">puberty</a>, and <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muscle_growth.html" title="Muscle growth">muscle growth</a>. The most widespread use of anabolic steroids is their use for chronic wasting conditions, such as <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cancer.html" title="Cancer">cancer</a> and <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_b1c7.html" title="AIDS">AIDS</a>. Anabolic steroids can produce numerous physiological effects including increases in protein synthesis, muscle mass, strength, appetite and bone growth. Anabolic steroids have also been associated with numerous side effects when administered in excessive doses and these include elevated <a href="../../../c/h/o/Cholesterol.html" title="Cholesterol">cholesterol</a> (increase in <a href="../../../l/o/w/Low_density_lipoprotein.html" title="Low density lipoprotein">LDL</a>, decreased <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_density_lipoprotein.html" title="High density lipoprotein">HDL</a> levels), <a href="../../../a/c/n/Acne_vulgaris.html" title="Acne vulgaris">acne</a>, elevated <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_pressure.html" title="Blood pressure">blood pressure</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/p/Hepatotoxicity.html" title="Hepatotoxicity">hepatotoxicity</a>, and alterations in <a href="../../../l/e/f/Left_ventricle.html" title="Left ventricle">left ventricle</a> <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morphology_%28biology%29.html" title="Morphology (biology)">morphology</a>.</p>
<p>Today anabolic steroids are controversial because of their widespread use in competitive <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sports.html" title="Sports">sports</a> and their associated side effects. While there are numerous health issues associated with excessive anabolic steroid use, public understanding of the true risks remains limited. Anabolic steroids are controlled in a few countries including the United States, where they are listed as Schedule III in the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controlled_Substances_Act_0a87.html" title="Controlled Substances Act">Controlled Substances Act</a>, as well as Canada and Britain who also have laws controlling their use and distribution.</p>

<p>Comments on professional athletes in ancient Greece suggest that a wide variety of natural steroidal substances were used to promote androgenic and anabolic growth. These may have ranged from testicular extracts to plant materials. <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traditional_medicine.html" title="Traditional medicine">Traditional medicine</a> in general, in the West as well as in contemporary Asian medicine, has a wide pharmacopeia of substances intended to promote virility and masculine traits, though not entirely oriented towards muscle growth and athletic ability so much as sexual performance. In Chinese traditional medicine substances such as deer antler, tiger bone, bear gall bladder, ginseng and other roots and much more were all primarily consumed and were thought to bolster the male organism, though there is no scientific evidence such potions have any effect.</p>
<p>Modern pharmaceutical anabolic steroids are believed to have been inadvertently discovered by German scientists in the early <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a>, but at the time the discovery was not considered significant enough to warrant further study. The first known reference to an anabolic steroid in a US weightlifting/bodybuilding magazine is testosterone propionate in a letter to the editor in Strength and Health magazine in 1938. In the 1950s, scientific interest was rekindled, and methandrostenolone (<a href="../../../d/i/a/Dianabol.html" title="Dianabol">Dianabol</a>) was approved for use in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> by the federal <a href="../../../f/o/o/Food_and_Drug_Administration_b75c.html" title="Food and Drug Administration">Food and Drug Administration</a> in 1958 after promising trials had been conducted in other countries.</p>
<p>Throughout the '50s, '60s, '70s and even '80s there was doubt that anabolic steroids were anything more than a <a href="../../../p/l/a/Placebo_effect.html" title="Placebo effect">placebo effect</a>. In a 1972 study,<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> participants were informed they would receive injections of anabolic steroids on a daily basis, but instead had actually been given <a href="../../../p/l/a/Placebo.html" title="Placebo">placebo</a>. They reportedly could not tell the difference, and the perceived <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stamina.html" title="Stamina">performance enhancement</a> was similar to that of subjects taking the real anabolic compounds. This study had many flaws including inconsistent controls and insignificant doses. According to Geraline Lin, a researcher for the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Institute_on_Drug_Abuse_fdeb.html" title="National Institute on Drug Abuse">National Institute on Drug Abuse</a>, at the time of the books' publishing in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>, the results of the study remained unchallenged for 18 years.<sup id="_ref-AASA_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AASA" title="">[2]</a></sup> In the 1996 study mentioned above which was founded by the <a href="../../../n/i/h/NIH_0352.html" title="NIH">NIH</a> it examined the effect of high doses of testosterone enanthate (600 mg/week intramuscularly for 10 weeks). The results showed a clear increase in muscle mass and decrease in fat mass in those who took the testosterone opposed to the placebo. No adverse reactions were noted.<sup id="_ref-Bhasin_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bhasin" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the late 1980s the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congress_of_the_United_States_f5e4.html" title="Congress of the United States">U.S. Congress</a> had been considering placing anabolic steroids under the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controlled_Substances_Act_0a87.html" title="Controlled Substances Act">controlled substance act</a> due to recent controversy over <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Johnson_%28sprinter%29_0619.html" title="Ben Johnson (sprinter)">Ben Johnson's</a> victory at the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988_Summer_Olympics_e1dd.html" title="1988 Summer Olympics">1988 summer Olympics</a> in <a href="../../../s/e/o/Seoul.html" title="Seoul">Seoul</a>. During deliberations the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Medical_Association_5470.html" title="American Medical Association">AMA</a>, <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drug_Enforcement_Administration_8665.html" title="Drug Enforcement Administration">DEA</a>, <a href="../../../f/o/o/Food_and_Drug_Administration_b75c.html" title="Food and Drug Administration">FDA</a> as well as the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Institute_on_Drug_Abuse_fdeb.html" title="National Institute on Drug Abuse">NIDA</a> all opposed listing anabolic steroids as controlled substances citing the fact that use of these hormones simply doesn't lead to the physical or psychological dependence required for scheduling under the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controlled_Substances_Act_0a87.html" title="Controlled Substances Act">Controlled substance act</a>. However the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congress_of_the_United_States_f5e4.html" title="Congress of the United States">U.S. Congress</a> in the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 1990 placed anabolic steroids into Schedule III of the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controlled_Substances_Act_0a87.html" title="Controlled Substances Act">Controlled substance act</a> (CSA). The <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controlled_Substances_Act_0a87.html" title="Controlled Substances Act">CSA</a> defines anabolic steroids as any drug or hormonal substance chemically and pharmacologically related to <a href="../../../t/e/s/Testosterone.html" title="Testosterone">testosterone</a> (other than <a href="../../../e/s/t/Estrogen.html" title="Estrogen">estrogens</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progestin.html" title="Progestin">progestins</a>, and <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corticosteroid.html" title="Corticosteroid">corticosteroids</a>) that promotes muscle growth. By the early 1990s after anabolic steroids were scheduled in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> several pharmaceutical companies stopped manufacturing or marketing the products in the United States, including Ciba, Searle, Syntex and others.</p>
<p>In addition, an entire market for counterfeit drugs emerged at this time. Never seen in the previous 30 years of their availability on the U.S. market, computers and scanning technology made the ease of counterfeiting legitimate products by utilizing their original label design, and the market was flooded with products that contained everything from mere vegetable oil to toxic substances which unsuspecting users injected into themselves, of which some died as a result of blood poisoning, methanol poisoning or subcutaneous abscess.</p>

<p>Anabolic steroids are <a href="../../../a/n/d/Androgen.html" title="Androgen">androgenic</a> and therefore produce androgenic effects in the body. Androgens stimulate <a href="../../../m/y/o/Myogenesis.html" title="Myogenesis">myogenesis</a> which is the formation of muscular tissue. <a href="../../../a/n/d/Androgens.html" title="Androgens">Androgens</a> are known to cause <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypertrophy.html" title="Hypertrophy">hypertrophy</a> of both types (I and II) of muscle fibers however the mechanism of this is not completely understood and there are a few accepted mechanisms through which this may occur. It's widely understood that supraphysiological doses of testosterone in non-hypogonadal men promotes nitrogen density and increases fat free mass (muscle mass) while at the same time decreasing fat, particularly abdominal fat. The increase in muscle mass is mostly skeletal muscle increases and are likely caused by an increase in the synthesis of muscle proteins or possibly a decline in the breakdown in muscle proteins.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[6]</a></sup> It has also been hypothesized<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[7]</a></sup> that androgens regulate body composition by promoting the commitment of mesenchymal <a href="../../../p/l/u/Pluripotent.html" title="Pluripotent">pluripotent</a> cells into myogenic lineages and inhibiting their differentiation into adipogenic lineages. However, androgens may also play an anticatabolic role in inhibiting skeletal muscle atrophy through antiglucocorticoid action independent of the androgen receptor.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>The mechanisms of action differ depending on the specific anabolic steroid. Different types of anabolic steroids bind to the androgen receptor to varying degrees depending on their chemical structure. Anabolic steroids such as <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methandrostenolone.html" title="Methandrostenolone">methandrostenolone</a> do not bind strongly to the androgen receptor and instead directly affect <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protein_synthesis.html" title="Protein synthesis">protein synthesis</a> or <a href="../../../g/l/y/Glycogenolysis.html" title="Glycogenolysis">glycogenolysis</a>: while steroids such as <a href="../../../o/x/a/Oxandrolone.html" title="Oxandrolone">oxandrolone</a> bind tightly to the androgen receptor and act mostly on <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transcription_%28genetics%29.html" title="Transcription (genetics)">transcription</a>.</p>

<p>There are three common routes for the administration of anabolic steroids: oral (for steroids in pill form), injectable, and transdermal. Oral administration, while perhaps the most convenient, suffer from the fact that they often need to be chemically modified (17 alpha-alkylated) so that the liver cannot break it down before it reaches the blood stream, this can cause <a href="../../../h/e/p/Hepatotoxicity.html" title="Hepatotoxicity">hepatotoxicity</a> in higher doses.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[9]</a></sup> Injectable steroids are typically administered intramuscularly, to avoid sharp blood level changes. Finally, transdermal administration via creams, gels or transdermal patches is very convenient and is becoming more popular.</p>

<p>Anabolic androgenic steroids produce anabolic and <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virilization.html" title="Virilization">virilizing</a> (also known as androgenic) effects. Most anabolic steroids work in two simultaneous ways. First, they work by binding to the <a href="../../../a/n/d/Androgen_receptor.html" title="Androgen receptor">androgen receptor</a> and increasing <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protein_synthesis.html" title="Protein synthesis">protein synthesis</a>. Second, they also reduce recovery time by blocking the effects of the stress hormone, <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cortisol.html" title="Cortisol">cortisol</a>, on muscle tissue.

<p>Typically, bodybuilders, athletes and sportsmen who use anabolic steroids try to minimize the negative side effects. For example, users may increase their amount of cardiovascular exercise to help negate the effects of <a href="../../../l/e/f/Left_ventricle.html" title="Left ventricle">left ventricle</a> <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organ_hypertrophy.html" title="Organ hypertrophy">hypertrophy</a>.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[26]</a></sup> Some androgens will aromatise and convert to <a href="../../../e/s/t/Estrogen.html" title="Estrogen">estrogen</a>, potentially causing some combination of the side effects listed above.

<p>Furthermore, to combat the natural testosterone suppression and to restore proper <a href="../../../h/p/t/HPTA_3628.html" title="HPTA">HPTA</a> function, what is known as '<a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-cycle_therapy.html" title="Post-cycle therapy">post-cycle therapy</a>' (PCT) is self prescribed. PCT takes place after the course of anabolic steroids. It typically consists of a combination of the following drugs, depending on which protocol is used:</p>
<ul>
<li>A SERM such as <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clomiphene_citrate.html" title="Clomiphene citrate">clomiphene citrate</a> and/or <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamoxifen_citrate.html" title="Tamoxifen citrate">tamoxifen citrate</a> (this is the primary PCT drug).<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[28]</a></sup></li>

</ul>
<p>The aim of PCT is to return the body's endogenous hormonal balance to its original state within the shortest space of time. People prone to premature hair loss that can be exacerbated by steroid use, have been known to take the prescription drug <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finasteride.html" title="Finasteride">finasteride</a> for prolonged periods of time. Finasteride reduces the conversion of <a href="../../../t/e/s/Testosterone.html" title="Testosterone">testosterone</a> to <a href="../../../d/h/t/DHT_2443.html" title="DHT">DHT</a>, the latter having much higher potency for <a href="../../../a/l/o/Alopecia.html" title="Alopecia">alopecia</a>.

During World War II, German scientists worked on synthesizing other anabolic steroids, and ran experiments on human prisoners, as well as with their own soldiers. They had hoped to increase the aggressive tendencies of their troops.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Anabolic_steroid.html" title="Edit section: Popular misconceptions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Popular misconceptions</span></h2>
<p>Anabolic steroids, like many other <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drugs.html" title="Drugs">drugs</a>, have been at the center of controversy and because of this there are many popular misconceptions and myths concerning their effects and side effects. As with many infamous drugs in popular culture, the misconceptions relating to anabolic steroids have likely arisen from misunderstandings of their actual side effects. One such common misconception purveyed in popular culture and the media includes the myth that anabolic steroids are highly dangerous and users' mortality rates are high. Anabolic steroids are used widely in the medical field without any serious health risks to users,<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[41]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[42]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[43]</a></sup> and no scientific evidence has shown any long-term serious health defects from proper use of anabolic steroids. While risk of death is present in many drugs, the risk of premature death from use of anabolic steroids seems to be extremely low.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[44]</a></sup>Former assistant professor at the University of Toronto Dr. Mauro Di Pasquale has stated “As used by most people, including athletes, the adverse effects of anabolic steroids appear to be minimal,".<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[45]</a></sup> It is possible this myth gained popularity from claims that <a href="../../../l/y/l/Lyle_Alzado_7a13.html" title="Lyle Alzado">Lyle Alzado</a> died from brain cancer caused by anabolic steroids. Alzado himself had claimed that his cancer was caused by anabolic steroids. However, there is no medical evidence anabolic steroids can cause brain cancer let alone the type of T-cell lymphoma he suffered from. Moreover Alzado's doctors stated that anabolic steroids did not contribute to his death.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>
<p>Other examples might include the misconception that anabolic steroids can ‘shrink’ one's <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis.html" title="Penis">penis</a>. It is likely that this myth came from the real side effect of anabolic steroids known as <a href="../../../t/e/s/Testicular_atrophy.html" title="Testicular atrophy">testicular atrophy</a>, in which the use of anabolic steroids causes reduced secretion of the <a href="../../../g/o/n/Gonadotropin.html" title="Gonadotropin">gonadotropin</a> <a href="../../../l/u/t/Luteinizing_hormone.html" title="Luteinizing hormone">luteinizing hormone</a> and <a href="../../../f/o/l/Follicle_stimulating_hormone.html" title="Follicle stimulating hormone">follicle stimulating hormone</a> from the anterior pituitary gland, thus reducing testicle size. This side effect is temporary and the testicles return to normal soon after exogenous androgen administration is halted.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[47]</a></sup></p>
<p>More myths relating to purported side effects include claims that anabolic steroids have caused many teenagers to commit <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide.html" title="Suicide">suicide</a>. While lower levels of <a href="../../../t/e/s/Testosterone.html" title="Testosterone">testosterone</a> have been known to cause <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clinical_depression.html" title="Clinical depression">depression</a>, and ending a <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steroid_cycle.html" title="Steroid cycle">steroid cycle</a> is known to result in temporarily lower testosterone levels, the claim that anabolic steroids are responsible for specific suicides among teenagers is highly questionable. In the United States the estimated use of anabolic steroids among high school students was 2.8% in 1999. On the other hand, in the year 2000 in the United States, suicide was the third leading cause of death among 15- to 24-year-olds.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[48]</a></sup> With the suicide rate this high among teenagers, concluding anabolic steroids are responsible for the suicides of teenagers who happened to be taking them prior to committing suicide is a <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post_hoc.html" title="Post hoc">post hoc</a> logical fallacy. Also, even though teen bodybuilders have been using steroids since at least the early 1960s, only a few cases suggesting a link between steroids and suicide have been reported in the medical literature.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[49]</a></sup></p>
<p>One of the most common misconceptions regarding the side effects of anabolic steroids is known as ‘roid rage’. There seems to be little or no evidence such a condition actually exists. Some early studies done have shown a slight correlation between manic symptoms and anabolic steroid use,<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[50]</a></sup> however more comprehensive and recent studies have brought into question their methodology and conclusions. The majority of recent studies done on "angry behavior" and anabolic steroid use show no psychological effect, implying that either "roid rage" doesn't exist or that anabolic steroids' effects on aggression are too small to be measured. Harvard researcher Harrison Pope, M.D. stated “With regard to the ‘roid rage’ issue, my first reaction as a scientist, obviously, is that ‘roid rage’ is a meaningless term that simply arose in popular parlance”. Many scientists and medical professionals have concluded anabolic steroids have no real effect on increased aggressive behavior.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[51]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[52]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[53]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[54]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[55]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnold_Schwarzenegger_088f.html" title="Arnold Schwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> is the subject of another myth regarding the side effects of anabolic steroids. <a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnold_Schwarzenegger_088f.html" title="Arnold Schwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> has admitted to using anabolic steroids during his bodybuilding career for many years,<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[56]</a></sup> and in 1997 he underwent surgery to correct a defect relating to his heart. Some have assumed this was due to anabolic steroids. Although anabolic steroids when abused can sometimes cause unfavorable enlargement and thickening of the left ventricle, <a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnold_Schwarzenegger_088f.html" title="Arnold Schwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> was born with a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congenital_disorder.html" title="Congenital disorder">congenital</a> genetic defect in which his heart had a <a href="../../../b/i/c/Bicuspid_aortic_valve.html" title="Bicuspid aortic valve">bicuspid aortic valve</a> — in other words, whereas normal hearts have three cusps, his had only two, which can occasionally cause problems later in life.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[57]</a></sup></p>

<p>Since anabolic steroids are often produced in different countries than in which they are distributed, they must be <a href="../../../s/m/u/Smuggling.html" title="Smuggling">smuggled</a> across international borders. Like most significant smuggling operations, sophisticated <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organized_crime.html" title="Organized crime">organized crime</a> is involved, often in conjunction with other smuggling efforts (including other illegal drugs).

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Anabolic_steroid.html" title="Edit section: Production">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Production</span></h3>
<p>Anabolic steroids need sophisticated pharmaceutical processes and equipment to produce, so they are produced by legitimate pharmaceutical companies or underground laboratories with large overheads. Common problems associated with illegal drug trades, such as chemical substitutions, cutting, and diluting, affect illegal anabolic steroids such that when it reaches distribution the quality may be questionable or possibly dangerous.</p>
<p>In the 1990s most US producers such as <a href="../../../c/i/b/Ciba.html" title="Ciba">Ciba</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/a/Searle.html" title="Searle">Searle</a> and <a href="../../../s/y/n/Syntex.html" title="Syntex">Syntex</a> stopped making and marketing anabolic steroids within the US. However, in many other regions, particularly Eastern Europe, they are still produced in quantity. European anabolic steroids are the source of most medical grade anabolic steroids sold illegally in North America. However, anabolic steroids are still in wider use for veterinary purposes, and many illegal anabolic steroids are actually veterinary grade.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Anabolic_steroid.html" title="Edit section: Distribution">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Distribution</span></h3>
<p>In the United States and Canada, steroids are purchased just like any illegal drug through dealers who are able to obtain the drugs from a number of sources. Most users would prefer to buy from legitimate sources but cannot because of the restrictive laws against steroid possession. Counterfeit steroids are a common solution to the lack of legal availability in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_of_America_8a5e.html" title="United States of America">United States</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>, although black-market importation continues from Mexico, Thailand and other countries where steroids are more easily available and, in many countries, not illegal at all. Many people produce fake steroids and attempt to sell them over the internet which causes a wide variety of health concerns.</p>
<p>Most illicit anabolic steroids are now sold at gyms, competitions, and through the mail. For the most part, these substances are smuggled into the United States. In addition, a significant number of counterfeit products are sold as anabolic steroids, particularly via mail order from websites posing as overseas pharmacies. In addition to the recreational use of anabolic steroids, users in <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> have been shown to consume illicit drugs as well, such as <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannabis.html" title="Cannabis">cannabis</a>, and <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cocaine.html" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a>.<sup id="_ref-cy_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cy" title="">[58]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[62]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[63]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Anabolic_steroid.html" title="Edit section: Movement for decriminalization">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Movement for decriminalization</span></h2>
<p>Anabolic steroids are <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schedule_III_40df.html" title="Schedule III">Schedule III</a> controlled substances in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_of_America_8a5e.html" title="United States of America">United States</a> and are strictly regulated in some other countries. (It is perhaps worth noting that anabolic steroids are readily available without a prescription in some other countries such as Mexico, Germany, and Thailand.) However, since the U.S. Congress passed the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 1990, a small movement has arisen that is highly critical of current laws concerning anabolic steroids. On June 21, 2005 <a href="../../../r/e/a/Real_Sports_7ad3.html" title="Real Sports">Real Sports</a> aired a segment discussing the legality and prohibition of anabolic steroids in America.<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[64]</a></sup> The show featured <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_I._Wadler%2C_M.D._a6ce.html" title="Gary I. Wadler, M.D.">Gary I. Wadler, M.D.</a>, chairman of the U.S. Anti- Doping Agency and a prominent anti-steroid activist. When pressed for scientific evidence by correspondent <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armen_Keteyian_9c67.html" title="Armen Keteyian">Armen Keteyian</a> that anabolic steroids are as 'highly fatal' as he claims, Wadler admitted there was no evidence. Gumbel concluded the 'hoopla' concerning the dangers of anabolic steroids in the media was 'all smoke and no fire.' The show also featured John Romano, a pro-steroid activist who authors 'The Romano Factor,' a pro-steroid column for bodybuilding magazine Muscular Development.<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[65]</a></sup></p>
<p>In July 2005 Philip Sweitzer, an Attorney and Author, published an open letter to the Members of the House Committee on Government Reform, and the Senate Committee on Commerce <i>et al.</i> In it he criticized lawmakers' actions in scheduling anabolic steroids, as well as criticized their 'disregard of scientific reality for symbolic effect.' He also pleaded for the consideration of the decriminalization of anabolic steroids and asked for a new policy direction.<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[66]</a></sup> Several other legal reviewers have criticized controlled substance status for anabolic steroids, including lawyer Rick Collins whose book, Legal Muscle, is one of the most detailed published resources on anabolic steroids and the law. Collins opposes non-medical teen steroid use or steroid use to cheat in sports, but advocates wider discretion for physicians in the case of mature adults. In 2006 he argued at "PUMPED" a steroid seminar in Manhattan the risks associated with anabolic steroids in the media are overtly bias as well as incredibly misinformed. He also argues that anabolic steroid criminalization increases the risks associated with anabolic steroids due to impurities in the black market.<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[67]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[68]</a></sup> However, the U.S. government's position since the late 1980s has been and continues to be that the risks of steroid use are 'too great' to allow them to be decriminalized or unregulated.</p>
