<p>Infinity, stop deleting sourced relevant information. The "Anarchist FAQ" says it was written by "social anarchists" and they say they "reject" individualist anarchism. "However, while social anarchists disagree with the proposals of individualist anarchists, we do still consider them to be a form of anarchism" <a href="http://infoshop.org/faq/secG4.html" class="external text" title="http://infoshop.org/faq/secG4.html" rel="nofollow"><i>Why do social anarchists reject individualist anarchism?</i></a> This should be noted.

<p>And, about Tucker, Tucker does not define capitalism, hence, he doesn't say he opposes capitalism, but rather says he opposes state-backed monopoly privileges for capital. You're trying to make it look like Tucker is arguing against anarcho-capitalism. Arguing against capitalism and arguing against anarcho-capitalism, is not the same thing for individualists. I'm not saying Tucker doens't oppose capitalism, but that he doesn't oppose private ownership of the means of production (or wage labor) --he favors a free market economy. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 16:14, 22 February 2006 (UTC)..

<dl>
<dd>How is that relevant to the argument? Why aren't all the authors of all the sources labelled as left/right whatever?
<dl>
<dd>It's relevant because it's a communist criticism. Communists oppose private ownership of the means of production and wage labor. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 17:02, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>read Kropotkin or Malatesta. Both explicitly state that self-employed workers and peasants would retain their tools/land in communist-anarchism. That is because it is free communism. Like the individualist anarchists, they argue for "occupancy and use" and apply this to workplaces as well as land. Logically, this is the only consistent anarchist position as the boss holds a monopoly of power of their property (as confirmed, ironically enough, by Murray Rothbard).

<dd>It doesn't say Tucker is against private MOP. It doesn't say Tucker doesn't favour a free market economy. All it says is that Tucker thinks capitalism is un-anarchistic and/or authoritarian. Tucker doesn't argue for or against anarcho-capitalism before he was dead before it got invented.

<dd>Tucker is not attacking anarcho-capitalism. He's attacking state-backed monopoly privilege for capital. If you want to know whether he thought anarcho-capitalism was compatible with anarchism, he called Auberon Herbert a "true anarchist." <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 17:02, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And Herbert rejected the label! As did other "voluntaryists". It should be noted that the individualist anarchists attacked the "voluntaryists" as being hypocrits and for defending the existing distribution of (coercively produced) property. And, of course, capitalist property rights (particularly in land). Tucker excommunicated anarcho-communism from anarchism, so should we exclude Kropotkin from anarchism? <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackFlag_0a78.html" title="User:BlackFlag">User:BlackFlag</a> 02:02, 22 February 2006.</dd>

<dd>Here's what you put: "Others, such as some individualist anarchists, take a different approach, arguing that the state, by necessity, exists in capitalism, since state-backed monopolies bestow privileges for capitalists, allowing them to accumulate power and capital."

<dd>Why would you want to hide it? Of course it should be stated. The Anarchist FAQ is a very partisan source that says it's out to discredit anarcho-capitalism. The arguments it levels against it are from a communist perspective. That's very important for the reader to know. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 17:16, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, the arguments it levels against it are from an *anarchist* perspective. The FAQ also states that it seeks to show why "anarcho"-capitalism is not a form of anarchism. Which it does, imho. Also, if "voluntaryism" is "anarcho"-capitalism, then the voluntaryists themselves would have agreed with the FAQ! Herbert explicitly rejected the label anarchist, for example. It seems strange that his followers ignore his opinions on such matters! Is the FAQ "very partisan"? It is written by anarchists and so is very partisan in favour of anarchism. As every anarchist I've come across rejects the idea that "anarcho"-capitalism is a form of anarchism, I would suggest that it accurately reflects anarchist opinion on this matter. But then I do get the impression that for RJII the opinion of anarchists does not seem to matter much to him, a strange position to take if you are producing a document explaining what ideas anarchists hold.

<dd>Yes they are anarchist, but anarcho-communists, syndicalists, etc. They say they're "social anarchists" and they reject individualist anarchism and anarcho-capitalism. That's why they're so down on private ownership of capital and wage labor. Condemning private ownership of the means of production isn't a generic anarchists argument, but a "social anarchist" one. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 17:28, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Individualists anarchists do allow accumulation of capital. But, they think HUGE accumulations --in a disparity sense -- cannot occur with state intervention causing it. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 17:31, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>RJII, you're making it seem like "social anarchists" take up 50% of anarchists. They take up more like 95%. They <b>are</b> anarchists. Also, by saying "these guys are communists", you're also implying "therefore, obviously they will oppose capitalism, so don't trust what you read". <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfinity0_7a16.html" title="User:Infinity0">Infinity0</a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/f/User_talk%7EInfinity0_df0a.html" title="User talk:Infinity0">talk</a></sup> 17:34, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's not true. Individualists, which includes anarcho-capitalists, are huge in number. I'm not saying don't trust what you read. I'm pointing out that they're arguing from a "social anarchist" perspective. If communism has a bad name, it's not my fault. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 17:37, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK, then, point out they argue from a "social anarchist" perpective on their own article. Adding that section bloats up the article. If you want to add it in, you must note that they are the vast majority of anarchists. Also, "Ind inc. a-cap" is your own POV, I'd appreciate it if you stopped spewing it out repeatedly like it was the truth.</p>

<li>"Labor will then be in a position to dictate its wages, and will thus secure its natural wage, its entire product. Thus the same blow that strikes interest down will send wages up." -Benjamin Tucker, State Socialism and Anarchism</li>
<li>" Not to abolish wages, but to make every man dependent upon wages and secure to every man his whole wages is the aim of Anarchistic Socialism. What Anarchistic Socialism aims to abolish is usury. It does not want to deprive labor of its reward; it wants to deprive capital of its reward.

<dd>The FAQ also says that Mutualists like Proudhon were social anarchists. It backs up its analysis with quotes from Proudhon, so it is arguing from an *anarchist* perspective, not an exclusively communist one. It also notes that communist-anarchists like Kropotkin and Malatesta supported the right of self-employed people to their own land and tools. That an "anarcho"-capitalist thinks that advocating "occupancy and use" equals communism shows how far it is from anarchism. [[User:BlackFlag|BlackFlag] 08:36, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Are you kidding? The very fact that anything involving capitalism is acknowledged as part of anarchism is dispicable. It it should have any section whatsoever, it should be one or two sentences saying that due to the blatantly coercive and hierarchical institution of capitalism, it could NEVER be a part of anarchism and every anarchist in history and every real anarchist today that is either in the news, involved in any anarchist projects, and any anarchist prisoners are ALL 100% resolutely against capitalism. The illusion of this manifestation is an invention of the internet, "anarcho (cough cough)" capitalism would not have a single leg to stand on if it weren't for a few people on internet message boards talking about it and doing NOTHING besides that. Anarchism has ALWAYS been against ALL authority and hierarchy. Anti-capitalism was one of the driving forces behind the rise in movements that first called themselves "anarchist." There have been movements throughout world history that were anarchist before this but before this "capitalism" as we know it today didn't exist and so the negative energies then were focused on the states and economic systems of the day.</dd>

<dd>I always laugh when people say anarcho-capitalism is an "invention of the internet." Anarcho-capitalism was around long before the internet. If it's big on the internet, it's because the internet is giving people a voice. The internet reflects the voices in society. And the more people that have access to the the internet, the more the internet reflects the true ideas of society. The people talking about anarcho-capitalism on the internet are REAL PEOPLE. They're not ON the internet. Anarcho-capitalism is huge in the real world and the internet is a reflection of that. You just never saw them because they weren't out marching in the streets and throwing bombs and making spectacles of themselves. Now you see them, because they use their words rather than bombs. Anarcho-capitalism is only going to get bigger, especially because the more you fight it, the more you dispute it and make a controversy over it, the more attention it gets, and the more it grows. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 18:06, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Anarcho-capitalism is huge in the real world"? Really, how do we know? I've only met one and I've been in the anarchist movement for 20 years. I doubt any of my non-political friends have heard of it. Oh, I forgot, "they weren't out marching in the streets" -- which makes you wonder how RJII knows the numbers are "huge." And I loved the "bombs" reference -- very sad. btw, I'm happy to ignore and not "fight" "anarcho"-capitalism -- once they stop calling themselves anarchists. And I doubt that it will grow once the internal contradictions of it are exposed by anarchists. Which we are doing. But to be honest, the only reason we are doing that is because it calls itself "anarchist" -- in spite of its self-proclaimed forefathers rejecting the label! For an ideology so rooted in property, it seems ironic that it wants to steal the anarchist name! <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackFlag_0a78.html" title="User:BlackFlag">User:BlackFlag</a> 15:36, 24 February 2006</dd>

<dd>Okay: but that means he's a libertarian. I also find the idea of anarcho-capitalism contradictory. Anarchism is precisely a system that is "without rule" -- that rejects authoritarian relationships in all domains of society. How can people who believe in a system that by definition supports the control of the means of production (and thus of meaningful social power) by a minority of people consider itself 'anarchist'? Furthermore: anarchism is not just a theory, it was formulated as part of a larger historical coalition of anticapitalist workers' organizations.</dd>
<dd>Anarchism isn't just anti-statism, it's anti-authoritarianism; as such, "anarcho-capitalism" fails the ultimate litmus test. Don't take it from me; look at the two tables of anarchism that someone posted above, in which "anarcho-capitalism" shares relatively few ideas with any of the other anarchist schools of thought. And the ideas that it does share with mutualism (reformist, private property &amp; product of labor, anti-redistribution, individualism) make it sound much, much more like classical liberalism (or neoliberalism) than anarchism. Just looking at this taxonomically: why would we consider these to be part of the same category? Monkey-Man 07:28, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I view anarchism as being a system where there is no government and no laws. Indeed most normal people out there have this view of anarchy. Indeed if you look at the dictionary the definition of anarchy is: the complete absense of government and law. My view of anarchy is that it is a system without government and law. The only possible system of anarchy is capitalist. The only anarchy in the world is Somalia and it is completely capitalist. Anti-capitalism is completely unnecessary to anarchism. In fact it is clear when you look at anarcho-communist criticisms of Proudhon that anarchy will eventually lead to some form of capitalism. Proudhon believed people where innately equal so if you made them free then there would be equality but this is false IMO. A good example of anarchism is nature. However in nature it is obvious that there is no egalitarianism. Indeed private property (e.g. territorialism, nesting behaviours etc) are evident throughout the natural world and there is gross inequality (e.g. a few male lions getting all females). Also socialist anarchism makes absolutely no sense and is plainly contradictory. The reason is obvious: there is no way to guarantee equality without a central authority. It is also obvious that most forms of socialist anarchism cannot work unless everybody has the same political beliefs. But why should people think the same way? For instance, I believe in capitalism and there are others who believe in socialism. Why should everybody believe in socialism? Real anarchism would allow people to form there own social organizations and enter and leave them whenever they wanted. Anarcho-capitalism allows this sense it doesn't have the unnecessary constraint of equality. People could join a socialist society or a capitalist firm in anarcho-capitalism.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Once upon a time I was an anarcho-capitalist, and I also would have contended that it was the only "real" anarchism. However, now I see it related only very tenuously. Anthropologists would certainly disagree with you that egalitarianism is impossible; it's only impossible in extremely developed and complex societies. Native American society was fairly anarchist, and so was <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freetown_Christiania_82af.html" title="Freetown Christiania">Freetown Christiania</a>, and the only reason these projects failed is because of outward forces. Also note that one definition of government is "Administration or management of an organization, business, or institution" and anarcho-capitalism believes strongly in retaining this. Anarcho-capitalism is opposed to a state, and a nation, but it does not oppose government or laws. It only wants to transfer the power to govern to private industry. Your criticism of socialism makes no sense to me. If you have a central authority, you can't possibly have equality, you have a corrupt power structure. And why would people need to be socialist? No one would force anyone to be socialist, since for one thing politics would disintegrate and, since anarchism is voluntary, those who did not like the arrangement would be free to leave. Ideally, of course, there would be no need for anyone to do so, but the option would remain. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 09:12, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Real anarchism would allow people to form there own social organizations and enter and leave them whenever they wanted." Anarchists agree, except they do not think freely joining a totalitarian organisation due to economic necessity equates to anarchy or freedom. In "anarcho"-capitalism people could sell themselves into slavery, does that mean the slave is free or that he/she is living an anarchist life? Of course not. Calling capitalism "anarchy" makes as much sense as calling the current state system "anarchy" as there is no world government. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackFlag_0a78.html" title="User:BlackFlag">User:BlackFlag</a> 12:02, 10 March 2006</dd>

<dd>Carson and Gambone are among the most prominent contemporary mutualist writers.

Kevin Carson actually <a href="http://upaya.blogspot.com/2005/12/definitional-idiocy.html" class="external text" title="http://upaya.blogspot.com/2005/12/definitional-idiocy.html" rel="nofollow">credits me</a> (blush) with convincing him that anarcho-capitalism <i>shares roots</i> with the rest of the anarchist tradition. But he also <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/davidneiwert/109987517241945636/" class="external text" title="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/davidneiwert/109987517241945636/" rel="nofollow">cites</a> a distinction between "anarcho"-capitalists and anarcho-"capitalists" that I proposed in discussions on the anarchy-list (with Iain MacKay, Chuck0 and others), suggesting that some anarchocapitalists share more roots than others. Once upon a time, both Carson and I were individualists who argued that anarchocaps weren't anarchists.

<dd>The crucial thing to understand is that each school of anarchism uses the term "capitalism" differently. There is no common ground to communicate between schools of anarchism when you use the term. Ok, so an anarchist says he opposes capitalism. So what? What does that mean?

<p><i>Forty years ago, when the foregoing essay was written, the denial of competition had not yet effected the enormous concentration of wealth that now so gravely threatens social order.

<dd>Tucker argues against State intervention in the economy --against the state creating monopoly power that causes huge accumulations of capital which denies people without political connections cheap access to capital due to the lack of competition in lending. His position is that in a true laissez-faire environment that couldn't happen. He's saying there that intervention has caused so much wealth disparity over time that going laissez-faire now wouldn't be able to solve the problem.

<p>They think the state IS the capitalists.</p>

<dd><i>Moreover, like the social anarchists, the Individualist Anarchists were aware that the state was not some neutral machine or one that exploited society purely for its own ends. They were aware that it was a vehicle of class rule, namely the rule of the capitalist class over the working class. As noted above, Spooner thought that that "holders of this monopoly [the money monopoly] now rule and rob this nation; and the government, in all its branches, is <b>simply their tool</b>" and that "<b>the employers of wage labour . . . are also the monopolists of money</b>." [Spooner, Op. Cit., p. 42 and p. 48] Tucker recognised that "capital had so manipulated legislation" that they gained an advantage on the capitalist market which allowed them to exploit labour. [The Individualist Anarchists, pp. 82-3] He was quite clear that the state was a capitalist state, with "<b>Capitalists hav[ing] placed</b> and kept on the statute books all sorts of prohibitions and taxes" to ensure a "free market" skewed in favour of themselves.

<ul>
<li>I'm lost here. You're using one source to claim "some individualist anarchists"? That's bad form to start with. Also, what claim is the statement attacking? Which part of anarcho-capitalist beliefs is it in opposition too? To my eye anarcho-capitalists have rejected state based capitalism; their view is of voluntary entered transactions. I'm not going to argue the merits of that view, that's not what we are here to do, but unless there's a source you can cite of an anarcho-capitalist thinker stating that belief, you can't attack it. The Anarchist FAQ already makes the point that such exchanges can't be voluntary, to my eye.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(Edit conflict) As to defining the aiuthors of "An Anarchist FAQ", there does need to be some transparency on that front. RJII cites this "while social anarchists disagree with the proposals of individualist anarchists, we do still consider them to be a form of anarchism" as the basis for claiming them to be social anarchists. I would ask you all to consider an alternative, and describe the FAQ as written, initially, from the perspective of a refutation of anarcho-capitalist theory as a form of anarchism.<a href="http://infoshop.org/faq/intro.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://infoshop.org/faq/intro.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> There needs to be some description, since they are a primary source; we should contextualise the source so the reader can determine the validity of the information. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">talk</a> 20:30, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>OK, we'll remove the individualist anarchists/state, since there is only one source.

<dd>(Edit conflict) Regarding the anarchist FAQ, it has to be mentioned here. It's not as far as I know, notable enough for its own page as yet.

<ul>
<li><i>Most self-described anarchists deny that anarcho-capitalism is a form of anarchism, arguing that capitalism runs contrary to an egalitarian power structure and is an inherently authoritarian institution. Anarcho-capitalists argue that many dictionaries define anarchism as being a "rejection of all forms of coercive control and authority," which they say includes anarcho-capitalism.</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>and</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><i>Opponents argue that wage labour (and hence capitalism) are unanarchist, being authoritarian in nature[24] and that it is essential to anarchism for such practices to be abolished. For example, "An Anarchist FAQ"[25] argues that "social relations between capitalists and employees can never be equal, because private ownership of the means of production gives rise to social hierarchy and relations of coercive authority and subordination".[26]</i></li>

<dd>That's not saying he opposes wage labor. That's saying that if everyone has access to private ownership of capital that there will be more people becoming self-employeed.

<p>He wishes wage labour to be minimised - he opposes it. <i>"Spooner would destroy the factory system, wage labour [and the business cycle]. . . by making every individual a small capitalist, an independent producer."</i> [Eunice Minette Schuster, Native American Anarchism, p. 151] <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfinity0_7a16.html" title="User:Infinity0">Infinity0</a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/f/User_talk%7EInfinity0_df0a.html" title="User talk:Infinity0">talk</a></sup> 21:00, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ok, so you found a secondary source. Schuster is exaggerating a bit, but that's ok. Tucker clearly supports wage labor. And, "Making every individual a small capitalist"?

<dd>Don't you know how to read? The source says that every individual would be "an independent producer." How can *everyone* be a "small capitalist" and there still be wage labour? Bad terminology by Schuster, she means everyone would be a member of the "petit bourgeoisie" (i.e. self-employed farmers or artisans). To twist her comments into Spooner supporting capitalism (where the vast majority are wage slaves) is pretty sad. But I'm not surprised. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackFlag_0a78.html" title="User:BlackFlag">User:BlackFlag</a> 25:43, 24 February 2006

<dd>It depends on how you define capitalism. Some Marxist-oriented people define it as private ownership of the means of production. If that's how you define it, then Spooner is a capitalist. I don't define it that way, though. Private ownership of the means of production is a necessary condition of capitalism though. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 07:44, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Anarcho-capitalism is a widely used term. "Social anarchism" is a neologism used to encompass anarcho-communism and syndicalism.

<dd>There were no anarcho-capitalists at that time -- of course there wouldn't be any criticism at that period. To make the positive claim that <i>no individualist anarchist questions the pedigree of anarcho-capitalism as a form of anarchism</i>, you need to provide evidence. The burden of proof is on nobody but yourself. What you're essentially asserting is that God exists because nobody can prove that he doesn't. --AaronS 18:49, 22 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes there were. Auberon Herbert was an anarcho-capitalist, and Tucker called him a "true anarchist." Herbert just didn't call himself an anarcho-capitalist --the term wasn't invented yet. But, I know you're going to say that's irrelevant since he didn't call himself an anarcho-capitalist, and that's fine. But, contemporary labor-value individualist anarchists don't argue that anarcho-capitalism is not a form of anarchism either. Sure, the burden is on me to show that there are no individualist anarchists that say it's not a form of anarchism. But, I could say: "We have not found any individualist anarchists that deny that anarcho-capitalism is a form of anarchism." <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 18:56, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That argument makes no sense. People like Auberon Herbert and Gustave de Molinari didn't call themselves anarchist, and I don't think that was just some freak coincidence. They like most people saw their philosophies as incompatible with anarchism. It's as if you think anarchism doesn't exist outside of the United States. The vast majority of anarchists probably hadn't even read anything about it. With the exception of a few American individualists like Tucker, it was only anarcho-capitalist revisionists who decided to retroactively call these people anarchists to create their own roots. And I actually tend to see voluntaryism as not necessarily anarcho-capitalist. If everything is contractually based, I don't know why you're necessarily left with capitalism, whatever Herbert himself had to say. If anything I consider voluntaryism the purest form of liberal anarchism, and much more similar to individualist anarchism than anarcho-capitalism. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 21:36, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes Molinari's 'Production of Security' reads much like anarcho-capitalist stuff on PDAs - though as Rothbard says he would have 'baulked at the term'. We've had plenty of argument here, which I think is basically right, that you can't just pick out some writing 100 aeons before and say 'this thing by A sounds like what my school X is saying now, therefore A was one of us, whether he would have liked it or not'. Plus of course in Molinari's other work he supports the state - there are archived discussions on that you can look at. Herbert supported limited states, explicitly denied he was anti-state let alone an anarchist. Much seems to be made of Tucker's comment that H was a 'true anarchist' - you would think Herbert's own views on the matter would count for at least as much as Tucker's. As for Spencer, even in 'the right to disobey the state' or whatever it's called he says the state is a 'necessary evil'. My approach would be, at most, to describe these as 'antecedents' of ancapism in the same way we have diggers, taoists, et al down as antecedents of anarchism. These post hoc attributions need to be treated with care.<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBengalski_c6f3.html" title="User:Bengalski">Bengalski</a> 20:43, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>He would have "balked at the term" not because he opposed anarcho-capitalism, but because the term "capitalism" had not even been uttered until 1854 (as far as historians know), and even then it did not refer to an economic system, but to the mere ownership of a large amount of wealth. It's only in the 20th century that it refers to what it does now --a laissez-faire system. <a href="http://m-w.com/dictionary/capitalism" class="external autonumber" title="http://m-w.com/dictionary/capitalism" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> Of course he would have balked at the term. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 20:50, 22 February 2006 (UTC) And, of course, "anarchist" was only used as a pejorative back then. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 21:01, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Marx Das Capital was not until 1857, and he didn't use the term "capitalism" but "capitalist." And, the "capitalist production form" was not conceived as a laissez-faire economic system. Proudhon used the term "capitalist" in 1867. Look at old dictionaries if you need evidence that capitalism was not defined in the 19th century as it is now.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Loaded Words</span></h2>
<p>There are some seriously loaded words that keep causing problems here, and I think we need to find ways to remove the problem. The word capitalism is one. Socialists argue that capitalism is concentration of capital, while capitalists argue that it is a free market. Wage labor is causing some problems, because to socialists it necessarily implies profit, while to capitalists it merely means receiving money for labor worked. I'd like to think that this problem could be solved by saying socialists oppose employment? There is also the problem of the definition of socialism. To anarchist socialists, socialism means that the only source of wealth is labor and that only labor should be rewarded with wealth. To capitalists, socialism means a control economy. I think that for this article to make sense, and to eliminate the semantics causing so much debate here, it is necessary to define these terms in the manner that they are referred to by their respective philosophies. That is, use a different definition in each section, and point out that that is what we are doing. Anybody? <a href="../../../c/j/a/User%7ECJames745_5bd8.html" title="User:CJames745">CJames745</a> 23:33, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

For example, see the definition box in the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalism</a> article. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 00:30, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>This ariticle is probably best dedicated to the history of anarchism (including contemporary history), and the information about the schools split off, and those boxes RJII suggests put in their own articles. <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfinity0_7a16.html" title="User:Infinity0">Infinity0</a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/f/User_talk%7EInfinity0_df0a.html" title="User talk:Infinity0">talk</a></sup> 00:34, 23 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I was wondering if doing some of the history in smaller pieces might make it easier to get qualified folks to dig in a little more seriously, or to let those of us currently at it specialize a bit. On RJII's boxes: it might take <i>quite a few</i> little boxes, but acknowledging the differences in vocabulary—between factions and in different eras—helps the reader be sensitive to the kind of things that trip us up here, even when we're aware of them.

<dd>Yes, communists oppose all payment, but mutualists and collectivists do not. Infinity, I agree with your definition of wage labour but it is also a confusing definition because it can make it sound like all socialist anarchists oppose payment even if they sponsor labor notes. It's more important to get the concept than the language across. Only communists are against payment, collectivists and mutualists believe in payment equivalent to labor worked. A statement about the employer/employee relationship is much more vital. <a href="../../../c/j/a/User%7ECJames745_5bd8.html" title="User:CJames745">CJames745</a> 22:36, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I don't know much about Arthur Bestor, but he says the same in "The Evolution of the Socialist Vocabulary", a 1948 article in The Johns Hopkins University's respected <i>Journal of the History of Ideas</i>: "...the reason why the invention of this active term [communist] was delayed until the nineteenth century was that prior to that time the advocates of community of property had appeared so sporadically that no collective name for them was needed... There were no communists; there were only Anabaptists, or Diggers, or Shakers, or Labadists, or Herrnhuters, or Rappites, or Zoarites."

<dd>LOL. You're deleting relevant parts out of the passage. He's coming down on anarcho-communists for opposing wage labor. Here is the full quote: "If the men who oppose wages - that is, the purchase and sale of labor - were capable of analyzing their thought and feelings, they would see that what really excites their anger is not the fact that labor is bought and sold, but the fact that one class of men are dependent for their living upon the sale of their labor, while another class of men are relieved of the necessity of labor by being legally privileged to sell something that is not labor, and that, but for the privilege, would be enjoyed by all gratuitously. And to such a state of things I am as much opposed as any one. But the minute you remove privilege, the class that now enjoy it will be forced to sell their labor, and then, when there will be nothing but labor with which to buy labor, the distinction between wage-payers and wage-receivers will be wiped out, and every man will be a laborer exchanging with fellow-laborers. <b>Not to abolish wages, but to make every man dependent upon wages and secure to every man his whole wages is the aim of Anarchistic Socialism.</b> What Anarchistic Socialism aims to abolish is usury. It does not want to deprive labor of its reward; it wants to deprive capital of its reward. It does not hold that labor should not be sold; it holds that capital should not be hired at usury."</dd>

<p>So, he doesn't oppose wage labor. He oppose <i>profit</i> from being deducted from the wages. And the way he want to do this is to get rid of banking regulations which will keep interest rates near zero (due to increased competition in lending). Then, it would be much easier for a person to go into business for himself, by borrowing money from the bank at a negligible rate of interest to purchase his own means of production (tools, machines, etc). If he does that, if he obtains his OWN means of production, then he doesn't have to use someone else's means of production and agree to give the owner the profits in exchange for that use. There would still be wage labor in individualist anarchism, because of course, for various reasons, For example, not everyone wants to borrow the financial capital and risk not being able to pay back the loan, and get a bad credit rating. Also, it's a lot of work to start your own business. If you want to take the easy way out and choose to work for someone else, your wages would be higher since the State is not intervening in the economy --your wages would be at their "natural rate" which would align with the wages that accords with the labor theory of value. Employers wouldn't be able to take a profit because there would be a lower supply of people wanting to work for others, which of course causes wages to rise. "Labor will then be in a position to dictate its wages, and will thus secure its natural wage, its entire product. Thus the same blow that strikes interest down will send wages up. But this is not all. Down will go profits also."

<dd>Talking of "State Socialism and Anarchism", the 1911 postscript is very relevant here. Tucker argued that "concentrated capital" made individualist anarchism impossible. As he said, "freest competition, could it be instituted, would be unable to destroy" the trust. Clearly, he saw a situation when the state did not exist ("freest competition") but workers were still exploited and, consequently, it was not anarchism. This suggests that his comments on "two classes" would be applicable under "anarcho"-capitalism. This obviously flows into the individualist anarchist criticisms of "voluntaryism," namely that it would produce a society of two classes in which own class was forced to sell their labour to another who owned the means of production. If Tucker was not opposed to this (the reality of capitalism) then he would not have criticised the "voluntaryists" and not written his postscript. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackflag_222a.html" title="User:Blackflag">User:Blackflag</a> 08:45, February 2006.</dd>

<p>Also, (assuming Tucker is against wage labour) (saying this is an assmuption for the purposes of NPOV) Tucker would have criticised anarcho-capitalism, since in anarcho-capitalism wage labour is allowed.

<dd>"Anarcho-capitalism was around. It was called Voluntaryism." And its supporters *explicitly* rejected calling themselves anarchists. So it is fair not to call it a form of anarchism, given this. As for "Tucker had no real problem with it" that is false. The Individualist Anarchists noted that "voluntaryism" involved keeping the existing distribution of property and then saying "no more coercion." They noted that this was hypocrisy and said that the poor would be right to expropriate land and capital (Yarro, as quoted in "Benjamin Tucker and the Champions of Liberty"). <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackFlag_0a78.html" title="User:BlackFlag">User:BlackFlag</a> 8:33, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Tucker excommunicated Kropotkin from anarchism, which means he is hardly a reliable guide to who is and who is not an anarchist! Herbert himself explicitly rejected the label anarchism. Between Herbert and Tucker, I think I'll stick with Herbert on what he thought his ideas should be called. Moreover, Kropotkin did not list "Voluntaryism" as a form of anarchism, nor did Nettleu. If it was "anarcho"-capitalism then, obviously, social anarchists rejected the idea that it was anarchist. So let me make a suggestion, change references to "anarcho"-capitalism to "voluntaryism" and note that its founding fathers rejected the label anarchist/anarchism.

<p>Which means he was an anti-capitalist, as the FAQ notes. And as the FAQ notes, Tucker did not oppose wage labour (although,logically, he should have). However, did argued that under individualist anarchism labour would receive what it produced. This made him an anti-capitalist from an anarchist perspective.

<dd>"the choice between working for an employer or for oneself will become entirely voluntary." Tucker doesn't oppose that. What are you talking about?

<dd>I don't know why you can't understand this. Tucker's position is that it's State regulations on banking that is causing individuals to have hardship in starting their own businesses. If banking were deregulated then people could borrow capital at low interest, which would reduce the supply of people seeking employment by others and cause wages to rise. He explains this in State Socialism. READ IT!!! He doesn't oppose wage labor at all. He oppose LOW wages caused by state intervention in the economy. And he opposes the difficulty of borrowing capital to start your own business because of state intervention. If the State stops regulating banking, then capitalism (in the sense of profit-making) disappears. But, wage labor does NOT, because not everyone wants to borrow and risk the capital, as well as make the effort, to start their own business. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 23:45, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's one quote showing nicely that Tucker doesn't like employers (as in capitalists in wage labour). I can't remember exactly, and I'm too busy right now to find it, but it says something to the effect of "no-one will be a buyer of labour". It really can't get more explicit than that. Also, in one of the quotes above he says something like "when they search through their emotions they will find that it is not buying/selling of labour that makes them angry, but the fact that one class of people is entirely dependent on selling their labour, and another class is relieved of labour because they have the capital to buy it".</dd>
<dd>As for the state, ind-anarchists acknowledge they and the capitalists are the same thing; why's this relevant?</dd>
<dd>And yes, I do understand that wage-labour is allowed; but they specifically formualted mutualism to minimise it. <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfinity0_7a16.html" title="User:Infinity0">Infinity0</a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/f/User_talk%7EInfinity0_df0a.html" title="User talk:Infinity0">talk</a></sup> 23:58, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Tucker would never say "no-one will be a buyer of labor." He says the OPPOSITE. Everyone will be a buyer of labor. And, "something like" is not good enough. Here is the quote: "<i>If the men who oppose wages - that is, the purchase and sale of labor - were capable of analyzing their thought and feelings, they would see that what really excites their anger is not the fact that labor is bought and sold, but the fact that one class of men are dependent for their living upon the sale of their labor, while another class of men are relieved of the necessity of labor by being legally privileged to sell something that is not labor, and that, but for the privilege, would be enjoyed by all gratuitously. And to such a state of things I am as much opposed as any one. But the minute you remove privilege, the class that now enjoy it will be forced to sell their labor, and then, when there will be nothing but labor with which to buy labor, the distinction between wage-payers and wage-receivers will be wiped out, and every man will be a laborer exchanging with fellow-laborers. Not to abolish wages, but to make every man dependent upon wages and secure to every man his whole wages is the aim of Anarchistic Socialism. What Anarchistic Socialism aims to abolish is usury. It does not want to deprive labor of its reward; it wants to deprive capital of its reward. It does not hold that labor should not be sold; it holds that capital should not be hired at usury.</i>" That's BLATANT support for wage labor. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 00:04, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Because you don't usually call self-employment wage labor. It's <i>technically</i> wage labor if you're selling your labor, but wage labor is more often understood to be someone that is laboring on someone else's means of production that gets paid for it. That's something that Tucker does not oppose. Rather, he wants to make sure that the person that owns that means of production is laboring as well --that he doesnt have an income without laboring.

<p>RJII, the quote you gave above says "the distinction between wage-payers and wage-receivers will be wiped out, and every man will be a laborer exchanging with fellow-laborers." This is an explicit statement that he doesn't believe in employment. He believes in a market where people trade their labor. There will be no wage-payers or wage-receivers, just laborers. I don't want to argue semantics so I'm not concerned here about whether we call this wage labor. The point is, it needs to be noted in the article that only anarcho-capitalists believe there should be a distinction between employer and employee. <a href="../../../c/j/a/User%7ECJames745_5bd8.html" title="User:CJames745">CJames745</a> 03:10, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>But, that's not true. He's just saying that the employer will labor too if banking is deregulated, so essentially there will not be a difference between employee and employer. He is not opposed to someone that doesn't own his own means of production and getting a job from someone who does --that's what employment is. It's clear from this statement that he doesn't oppose employmee/employee situations: "Let Carnegie, Dana &amp; Co. first see to it that every law in violation of equal liberty is removed from the statute-books. if, after that, any laborers shall interfere with the rights of their employers, or shall use force upon inoffensive "scabs," or shall attack their employers' watchmen, whether these be Pinkerton detectives, sheriff's deputies, or the State militia, I pledge myself that, as an Anarchist and in consequence of my Anarchistic faith, I will be among the first to volunteer as a member of a force to repress these disturbers of order and, if necessary, sweep them from the earth." He opposes the idea of an employer only in the sense of someone who is recieving an income without laboring --that is, someone not paying the employee the full produce of his labor. But, he doesn't think it's the employers fault, but the State's fault for regulating banking. The distinction about anarcho-capitalism that needs to be made is that anarcho-capitalists don't mind if an employee is paid less than his full produce, because they think value is subjective rather than intrinsically based in labor --they think profit is ok. Tucker thinks a person should be paid his full produce. He does not oppose employer/employee relationships AT ALL. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 03:46, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Here it is stated another way: "For those who do not know, capitalist wage work (or profit) is the social relationship where an employer (one who owns the places and means of production) receives more money then employees for equal time worked within a company. Rather than both the employer and employee being paid equally for equal time worked (which would then be non-capitalist and therefore non-exploitive employer and employee relationships which could exist within an Individualist Anarchy as stated by Benjamin Tucker), the employers unfairly pay themselves more money than employees for equal time worked resulting in the robbing of the employee's part of their income." <a href="http://www.geocities.com/listen_liberty/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/listen_liberty/index.html" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 03:55, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>And, here is Tucker defending the right of employer/employee relationships, in argument against State Socialism: "What becomes then of the personal liberty of those non-aggressive individuals who are thus prevented from carrying on business for themselves or from assuming relations between themselves as employer and employee if they prefer..." <a href="http://flag.blackened.net/daver/anarchism/tucker/tucker39.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://flag.blackened.net/daver/anarchism/tucker/tucker39.html" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> It's up to the individual whether he wants to work for himself or for someone else.

<p>The two quotes portray exactly what I am trying to tell you. The fist quote explains how Tucker believes "employers unfairly pay themselves more money than employees for equal time worked resulting in the robbing of the employee's part of their income." The second quote explains that this should not be combatted with legislation as state socialists believe.

<dd>That doesn't mean anything&#160;:"the distinction between employee and employer." There reader has no clue what it's talking about. The lack of distinction is that the employee and the employer both get equal pay for equal time worked.

<p>Anarhco-capitalism didn't exist.

<dd>Actually it did exist, but was called "voluntaryism" and he criticized it, but accepted it believing that it amounts to the same thing as individualist anarhcism --but that's another story. But, what ABOUT the employee/employee relationship is unfair? It's not the fact that an employee has an employer, but the fact that the employer is paying the employee less than his full produce --that he profits. If an employee is paid the full produce he has no problem with it. And agains, the employer is not at fault, but the state is for making profit possible by reducing competition among employers. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 04:36, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Problem solved, then. Call the section on "anarcho"-capitalism "voluntaryism" -- it only seems fair, given that its supporters did not call themselves anarchists. For example, Herbert explicitly rejected the term anarchist. Levy stated that "no Individualist would every call himself an Anarchist." He also noted that while individualist and communist anarchists disagreed on many subjects "their agreement [on others] entitled them equally to the general designation of Anarchist."

<dd>Tucker's thing was that the State regulated banking. You have to get a charter to start a bank and issue your own private money --it's not a free market. He thinks that there were no more regulations (<a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_banking.html" title="Free banking">free banking</a>), then there would be a proliferation of banks. All these banks competing to lend capital would drive interest rates to near zero. Then anyone who wanted to go into business for himself would be able to get a near zero interest loan and buy his own means of production. Then, with a much larger amount of people self-employed (owning their own means of production) the number of people seeking employment by using the means of production owned by OTHERS would be severely reduced. That would raise wages because businesses would be competing with each other trying to get laborers. Wages would rise to their "natural rate" rather than their artifically low rate. He is upset that there is a free market in labor, but not a free market in capital. "Laissez Faire was very good sauce for the goose, labor, but was very poor sauce for the gander, capital." If you can find a clearer way to say it, go ahead. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 05:23, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here is the full quote: "On discovering this, Warren and Proudhon charged the political economists with being afraid of their own doctrine. The Manchester men were accused of being inconsistent. The believed in liberty to compete with the laborer in order to reduce his wages, but not in liberty to compete with the capitalist in order to reduce his usury. Laissez Faire was very good sauce for the goose, labor, but was very poor sauce for the gander, capital. But how to correct this inconsistency, how to serve this gander with this sauce, how to put capital at the service of business men and laborers at cost, or free of usury, - that was the problem." He was saying that the current market is biassed in favor of capital. I changed it to reflect that. Here is what I put "Instead, he advocated a market where competition didn't favor capital over labor" <a href="../../../c/j/a/User%7ECJames745_5bd8.html" title="User:CJames745">CJames745</a> 09:46, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I decided to change it so it says "Instead, he advocated a deregulated market which he felt would no longer favor capital over labor." This is the cross between liberalism and socialism that american mutualists favor. The point being that legislation in the market allows capitalists to compete with workers but not the other way around. <a href="../../../c/j/a/User%7ECJames745_5bd8.html" title="User:CJames745">CJames745</a> 09:58, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>RJII, you give a extremely long winded explanation of Tucker which completely misses the point.</p>
<p>Yes, the capitalist-state is giving employers privileges so that they can employ workers at low prices. Blah blah. That's what wage labour is. A separate class of workers and employers. What does it matter whether Tucker thought the state was the cause? He still wanted the system to be abolished.</p>
<p>When everyone works, then there is no more wage labour. Simple. Unless you're still defining "wage labour" as "wages for labour", in which case it is only you that is defining that this way.</p>

<dd>I know the position. The problem is the term "wage labor." It's a primarily and originally a communist term. If a communist says he opposes wage labor, he means he opposes the buying and selling of labor. That's what I think when someone says they oppose wage labor --I figure they're communists. Individualists didn't use the term, because they supported buying and selling of labor. A few modern mutualists use it however, because of the communist influence on the language, and they mean it as someone that is hired to work using someone else's means of production, and they say there's nothing wrong with it. For example: "I have to stipulate that there’s nothing inherently wrong with wage labor." -<a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Carson_3c69.html" title="Kevin Carson">Kevin Carson</a> <a href="http://www.libertarian.co.uk/lapubs/econn/econn105.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.libertarian.co.uk/lapubs/econn/econn105.pdf" rel="nofollow"><i>Contract Feudalism</i></a> <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 16:00, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That's not wage labour. In wage labour when you sell labour-power your employer chooses what to do with it - he controls what you do.

<i>I was formerly, like yourself, sir, a very warm advocate of the abolition of slavery. This was before I saw that there was white slavery. Since I saw this, I have materially changed my views as to the manner of abolishing negro slavery. I see now clearly, I think, that to give the landless black the privilege of changing masters now possessed by the landless white would hardly be a benefit to him in exchange for his surety of support in sickness and old age, although he is in a favorable climate. If the southern form of slavery existed at the north, I should say the black would be a great loser in such a change.</i></p>

<dd>Yes it is wage labor. Wage labor is the buying and selling of labor. If an employer pays someone for his labor (wage labor), that's fine for Tucker. What Tucker doesn't like is if the employer derives income from the employees labor rather than his own labor. And, the way to help insure that this is the case is to institute complete laissez-faire so that market forces drive wages up.

<p>No, it's not. Read the definition. Wage labour is the buying and selling of labour power.

<dd>"If the men who oppose wages <b>[Kropotkin and the other COMMUNISTS]</b> - that is, the purchase and sale of labor - were capable of analyzing their thought and feelings, they would see that what really excites their anger is not the fact that labor is bought and sold, but the fact that one class of men are dependent for their living upon the sale of their labor, while another class of men are relieved of the necessity of labor by being legally privileged to sell something that is not labor, and that, but for the privilege, would be enjoyed by all gratuitously. And to such a state of things I am as much opposed as any one. But the minute you remove privilege, the class that now enjoy it will be forced to sell their labor, and then, when there will be nothing but labor with which to buy labor, the distinction between wage-payers and wage-receivers will be wiped out, and every man will be a laborer exchanging with fellow-laborers. <b>Not to abolish wages</b>, but to make every man dependent upon wages and secure to every man his whole wages is the aim of Anarchistic Socialism. What Anarchistic Socialism aims to abolish is usury. It does not want to deprive labor of its reward; it wants to deprive capital of its reward.

<dd>Why do you think Tucker is arguing against Kropotkin in <i>Labor and Its Pay</i>? It's because Kropotkin, a communist, wants to get rid of wage labor. Tucker is arguing to KEEP IT. He is OPPOSING the communist position on wage labor. You're trying to make it look like Tucker supported the communist opposition on wage labor.

<p>No, I'm not trying to make it look like Tucker supported communists. Stop assuming bad faith. I think you're too biased on this to look at the question objectively; you've been saying I'm coming from a communist perspective, why?? The concept of wage labour is not just used by communists, and the article in no way implies that Tucker was a communist.</p>
<p>You're forcing through the point that Tucker was against communism; great, except that it already says it in the article, and that is not relevant to the anti-anarcho-capitalist criticism. Your complaint that "wage labour implies communism" is based on your own bias; please stop trying to make it out like it's misleading to readers.</p>

<dd>"Capacity to work" is labor. Just saying he was "against employer-emmployee division" doesn't tell you anything. That's what I'm trying to tell you. What does he mean?

<p>Well, I think it's close, but I made a few changes. I didn't feel it was necessary to state Tucker's position on private property. That can be done elsewhere.

So, all this discussion amounts to Infinity wanting to use a misleading marxist definition for "wage labor." I suggest you simply not use the term.

He thought profit would be insignificant without State intervention in the economy." - Hogeye</p>

<p>RJII, please understand I am NOT trying to "inject communist POV into Tucker". I'm just interpreting what I'm reading. I used "wage labour" because that is the shortest way to say what he was talking about.</p>
<p>You're trying to explain and justify from your POV all the detailed intricacies of Tucker in one paragraph, because you think it misleads the reader. I don't understand how. I've removed the references to wage labour, now all it says is that he opposed the separation. How is the reader possibly misled now?</p>
<p>The paragraph is only meant to detail Tucker's differences between anarcho-capitalism, not give a full explanation why. That's already done elsewhere.

<dd>If you say he opposes the separation between employee and employer, then you need to explain what he means by that. He means that employers should have to labor for their incomes as well. He doesn't mean there are no more employee/employer situations. If you're trying "to detail Tucker's differences between anarcho-capitalism" that's not the way to do it. The difference lies in their respect theories of value. Tucker doesn't like profit. Anarcho-capitalists do. It has to little to do with employer/employee.

<p>Okay, here is what it said before:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Similarly, individualist anarchists were also opposed to this split between the separate classes of labourers and employers in capitalism (but were not opposed to private ownership of the means of production). For example, Benjamin Tucker argued for this distinction to be "wiped out" so that "every man will be a labourer exchanging with fellow-labourers"[13]. He advocated a deregulated market where he felt wages would be driven up to their "natural rate"[26], but was against prohibiting employer-employee relationships altogether. [27](Tucker did not explicitly argue against anarcho-capitalism, as it did not exist in his day.)"</dd>
</dl>
<p>Instead of endless flaming from both sides, let's go over this sentence by sentence and figure out what is wrong. I don't see any problems with it as is. I think it represents both sides quite fairly. If there is a problem with saying "this split between the separate classes of labourers and employers in capitalism" what is a better way of wording it. I recall earlier it said something about a separate class of non-workers who profited, and I think RJII was fine with it, so I don't know what is different here.

<p>Tucker quote: "distinction between wage-payers and wage-receivers will be wiped out". Then in the above section I showed that wage-payer == employer, which is where the discussion left off.

<p>This is turning into a lecture about individualist anarchism rather than a short criticism of anarcho-capitalism. Here is what we have:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Similarly, individualist anarchists also opposed this split between the separate classes of labourers and employers in capitalism (but were not opposed to private ownership of the means of production).

<dd>Individualist anarchists opposed capitalist property rights, particularly in land, in favour of an "occupancy and use" system of possession (Proudhon's mutualism). It may be argued that Tucker's support of non-exploitative (ie. non-capitalist) employer-employee relationships violates this principle, and contradicts opposition to the state as a monopoly of authority over a given area. However, individualist anarchism solves this contradiction by applying "occupancy and use" to workplaces as well as land, unlike anarcho-capitalism.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Let me see if I can shorten this</p>
<dl>
<dd>Similarly, individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker argued that under anarchy "every man will be a labourer exchanging with fellow-labourers"[13], although he didn't believe employers should be outright prohibited[27]. Instead, he felt that a deregulated market would drive wages up to their "natural rate"[26]. (Tucker did not explicitly argue against anarcho-capitalism, as it did not exist in his day.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Individualist anarchists also oppose property rights in land, favoring instead "occupancy and use." Unlike anarcho-communists, however, individualist anarchists do believe in private ownership of their own labor.</dd>

<dd>I don't like the statement "he didn't believe employers should be outright prohibited." This gives the reader the impression that he was against employment.

<dd>Yes, he wishes all employers to work as well, rather than just sitting back and doing nothing. That doesn't mean he's against employment. And, yes he does show approval for employers. As the Anarchist FAQ points out: "If we take the creation of employer-employee relationships within an anarchy, we see the danger of private statism arising (as in "anarcho"-capitalism) and so the end of anarchy. Such a development can be seen when Tucker argues that if, in an anarchy, "any labourers shall interfere with the rights of their employers, or shall use force upon inoffensive 'scabs,' or shall attack their employers' watchmen . . . I pledge myself that, as an Anarchist and in consequence of my Anarchistic faith, I will be among the first to volunteer as a member of a force to repress these disturbers of order, and, if necessary, sweep them from the earth."

<dd>And the FAQ also notes that Mutualist Anarchists like Proudhon are considered as social anarchists.

<dl>
<dd>Well documented? I don't think so. Proudhon supported wage labor. What he thought was unjust was wages and prices not matching up (profit). Speaking of strikes, he said: "While threatening to strike, some of them, indeed the majority, have demanded an increase in wages, others have demanded a reduction in working hours, and still others both at the same time. Surely the have always known that increased wages and reduced working hours can only lead to a general price increase. And surely they know that it is not a question of reducing or increasing prices and wages, but of making them equal. This is the first condition of wealth!" (Political Capacity of the Working Classes) I don't know what the Infoshop "Anarchist FAQ" says, but if it says Proudhon opposed wages, it's wrong.

<p>Alright, here is the current version. I changed the last sentence to point out the particular type of private property individualist anarchists advocate.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Similarly, individualist anarchists opposed the separation between the classes of employers and employees in capitalism. Benjamin Tucker proposed that under anarchy "every man will be a labourer exchanging with fellow-labourers"[13], although he argued neither to prohibit employement (despite his disapproval of it), nor to abolish wages.[26]. Instead, he felt that a deregulated market would drive wages up to their "natural rate"[27]. (Tucker did not explicitly argue against anarcho-capitalism, as it did not exist in his day.) Individualist anarchists also oppose property rights in land, favoring instead "occupancy and use." Unlike many social anarchists, however, individualist anarchists do believe in private ownership of the means of production based upon labor worked.</dd>

<p>Any problems? I support this version. <a href="../../../c/j/a/User%7ECJames745_5bd8.html" title="User:CJames745">CJames745</a> 02:32, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Technically, they also opposed property rights in things like houses as well -- the only exception to "occupancy and use" i've come across in Tucker is for workplaces. This seems a strange exception, imho. I would also note what "natural rate" is, namely the whole product of their labour. With these additions, I think it is okay -- although "property rights" is a bit vague. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackFlag_0a78.html" title="User:BlackFlag">BlackFlag</a> 09:46, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The scheme we were working to a while back, until everything got held up by edit-warring, was to structure the whole page more or less chronologically. That is, rather than splitting into anarchist 'schools' or 'types' on the one hand vs. historical events and movements on the other, the idea was to treat events and the development of ideas as a totality. RJII and Hogeye contested this - they wanted to separate out ideas and events and further split ideas into two big headings - 'individualism' and 'collectivism'. There was a vote taken a few months back (someehere in the archives) where basically everyone else supported the 'historical' version. Obviously we have new editors now who will have their own ideas, but I would recommend sticking with the historical approach, and I point anyone interested to the archives.<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBengalski_c6f3.html" title="User:Bengalski">Bengalski</a> 20:57, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Typifying in general is something we should shy away from. At present the article makes it sound like there are strictly distinct groups, even in reality anarchism is more fluid. Some of these labels aren't even really used by the people who fit them. Most anarchists identify as anarchists rather than more specific labels, presumably because the movement is unifying and rejects these distinctions.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>We should also make it a point to shy away from a few key thinkers and talk about anarchism more generally. As it is people are using a handful of people to represent an entire philosophy, saying things logically akin to "individualist anarchism says X, because benjamin tucker says X and he's an individualist anarchist". If individualist anarchism was a rigid ideology rather than a theory, that would be a sound argument. But no two anarchists agree on everything, no matter how many ways you cut it up. Although they might share a common goal (i.e. the end of rule), their ideas about how best to accomplish it varies. Focusing on efforts by anarchists makes the thinking of anarchists clear in a more general sense. As it is I think we weight far too strongly on theorists. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 21:29, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The word <i>anarchism</i> is <a href="../../../e/t/y/Etymology.html" title="Etymology">derived from</a> the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_language.html" title="Greek language">Greek</a> <i><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%B1%CF%81%CF%87%CE%AF%CE%B1" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:αναρχία">αναρχία</a></i> ("without <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archon.html" title="Archon">archons</a> (ruler, chief, king)"). Anarchism, as a <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_philosophy.html" title="Political philosophy">political philosophy</a>, is the belief that rulers are unnecessary and should be abolished. Anarchism also refers to <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_movement.html" title="Social movement">social movements</a> that advocate the elimination of authoritarian institutions, particularly the <a href="../../../s/t/a/State.html" title="State">state</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[5]</a></sup> In place of what are regarded as authoritarian political structures and coercive economic institutions, anarchists advocate social relations based upon <a href="../../../v/o/l/Voluntary_association.html" title="Voluntary association">voluntary association</a> of autonomous individuals, <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cooperation.html" title="Cooperation">cooperation</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutual_aid.html" title="Mutual aid">mutual aid</a>, and <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-governance.html" title="Self-governance">self-governance</a>.</p>
<p>While anarchism is most easily defined by what it is against, anarchists also offer positive visions of what they believe to be a truly free society. However, ideas about how an anarchist society might work vary considerably, especially with respect to <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchist_economics.html" title="Anarchist economics">economics</a>; there is also disagreement about how a free society might be brought about.</p>

<p>I don't think a general 'anarchist theory' section would help us. The endless wiki disputes bear witness that condensing 'anarchist theory' into one section is a pretty hopeless task.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">trimming the article</span></h3>
<p>Yeah I'll do some trimming of the article - if people aren't happy with what I've cut out they can always revert it. But I think we really don't need to go into as much detail on all of the theoretical niceties. Especially the sections on individualism, Proudhon etc. where there was most edit-warring have become extended as people insisted on getting their points in. But this level of detail is really more suited to the pages dedicated to those subjects - here we need only a basic summary or pointer to the debates. I also agree with Sarge Baldy above that there is too much emphasis on theory - we could actually do with a bit more on history as a few important things aren't even featured. Off the top of my head I'd like to see brief paras on the Haymarket martyrs, ukraine, Tolstoyan communes, even Paris 68. And then we have almost nothing on other parts of the world - Latin American anarchism for one, and I'm sure other places I know nothing about.<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBengalski_c6f3.html" title="User:Bengalski">Bengalski</a> 15:18, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I started doing some cutting - got as far as propaganda of the deed, I'll carry on further later if no one objects. I've been working on the principles: cut out duplication, quotes that say basically the same thing etc.; and all but the barest references to theoretical debates can be kept for the particular sub-articles.<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBengalski_c6f3.html" title="User:Bengalski">Bengalski</a> 16:32, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I had made a change to the anarcho-capitalism thread so that it said Tucker opposed the division of class instead of saying he opposed employment. I thought it was clearer because the definition of employment is vague. The intention here is to explain that he didn't want there to be a division of class into employers and employees, but rather a society of laborers exchanging with one another. Somebody changed it back. I'm curious why. Was it just to be concise? Because I did think it was an important distinction. <a href="../../../c/j/a/User%7ECJames745_5bd8.html" title="User:CJames745">CJames745</a> 06:30, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hmm... I was sure it said he supported division of class... Anyway, RJII's complaint was that it needs to mention that Tucker supported employment, otherwise readers would think he opposed it. -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfinity0_7a16.html" title="User:Infinity0">infinity</a><span style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="../../../i/n/f/User_talk%7EInfinity0_df0a.html" title="User talk:Infinity0">0</a></span> 16:29, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think Tucker's precise views on employment and class are exactly the kind of thing that would be better left to sub-pages on individualism, Tucker, and/or anarcho-capitalism.<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBengalski_c6f3.html" title="User:Bengalski">Bengalski</a> 16:34, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, I agree with that. I was trying to condense down that paragraph in the first place, but RJII kept arguing that it was misleading. We could cut out this bit:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>although he argued neither to prohibit employement (despite his disapproval of it), nor to abolish wages.[24]. Instead, he felt that a deregulated market would drive wages up to their "natural rate"[25]. (Tucker did not explicitly argue against anarcho-capitalism, as it did not exist in his day.)</i></dd>

<p>That is the sentence I just suggested to cut out. But as for your claim, Tucker wanted to destroy the class distinction, so it's safe to assume he opposed employment. Also, he says he supports their liberty, not their actual selfs, so it's safe to assume he did not support them. Also, you havne't provided a quote where he explicitly supports them, and since he opposes employer/ee class distinction, he would have explicitly stated he did support employers if he did, since his position is confusing and he would have known that. -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfinity0_7a16.html" title="User:Infinity0">infinity</a><span style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="../../../i/n/f/User_talk%7EInfinity0_df0a.html" title="User talk:Infinity0">0</a></span> 16:52, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But, since that's the one you remember. Let's look at your "Anarchist FAQ" on that: "If we take the first problem, namely the creation of employer-employee relationships within an anarchy, we see the danger of private statism arising (as in "anarcho"-capitalism) and so the end of anarchy. Such a development can be seen when Tucker argues that if, in an anarchy, "any labourers shall interfere with the rights of their employers, or shall use force upon inoffensive 'scabs,' or shall attack their employers' watchmen. . . I pledge myself that, as an Anarchist and in consequence of my Anarchistic faith, I will be among the first to volunteer as a member of a force to repress these disturbers of order, and, if necessary, sweep them from the earth." [Instead of a Book, p. 455]" -Infoshop anarchist FAQ (written by communists). They acknowledge that he supported employment, and that's one of the reasons why they "reject individualist anarchism." <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 17:07, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, he supports the liberty of such relationships.

<dl>
<dd>Of course he thought employers were a good thing. How else is someone with no means of production supposed to make an income? Employers serve a useful purpose. By his support of wages, that tells you that he supports employment. But more, importantly, you haven't provided a source saying he disapproves of employment. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 17:15, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>LOL! So to be an employer means you have to sit on your ass doing nothing? That's not what employer means. An employer is someone who own a means of production that allows someone else to use his means of production and pays them to operate it. That's not what Tucker is opposed to.

<dd>Personally I would support taking out the whole paragraph and move this debate to 'anarchism and ancapism'. All we should do on this page is state that most anarchists (not 'communists' or 'individualists', but simply most <b>anarchists</b>) oppose capitalism, and direct the reader to debates elsewhere. If RJII won't accept such a bare phrasing we should take this debate to some kind of vote or even arbitration, but adding chunks into the article to carry on the argument there isn't the right approach.<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBengalski_c6f3.html" title="User:Bengalski">Bengalski</a> 17:22, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This also needs to be taken out: "Similarly, individualist anarchists opposed the separation between the classes of employers and employees in capitalism." First, of all, by "similarly" you're equating him with the communists who wrote the Anarchist FAQ. Secondly, it's wrong. Nowhere does he says that he opposes a class distinction between employers and employees. What he opposes is a class distinction between some who work for a living, and others that don't.

<dd>"the communists who wrote the Anarchist FAQ"? The FAQ, as it says, is produced by social anarchists. It lists communist, syndicalist, collectivist and mutualist as schools of social anarchism. That RJII continues to equate social anarchist with communist anarchist says it all. For his information, anarchist opposition to wage labour is found in Proudhon. You need not be a communist to oppose it.

<p>The two of you need a serious breather. In any case, the version posted above is about perfect in my opinion. Let's implement it (if it hasn't been already, haven't checked the article).

<p>Alright, I went and did it. Like it says in the summary, I think it would be better to take info from previous versions and paste it into this version, rather than revert it, because the section was getting far too long. I also noticed that many of the other sections are decreasing in size, and I'm liking the way it looks. Very concise. Nobody would read the entire thing before if they didn't already know what anarchism was. <a href="../../../c/j/a/User%7ECJames745_5bd8.html" title="User:CJames745">CJames745</a> 23:43, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>That article also needs work, perhaps more so than this article. Could someone go have a look at it?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Anarchist communism section</span></h2>
<dl>
<dd>Proudhon and Bakunin both opposed communism, which in their time was strongly associated with the statist ideas of thinkers such as Étienne Cabet. However, in the 1870s the majority of anarchists moved away from Bakunin's economic thinking (called "collectivism") and embraced communist concepts. The essence of the communist theory was that the means of production should be owned collectively, and that consumption goods should be distributed according to need rather than in relation to individuals' labour. [3]</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>An early proponent of anarchist communist was Joseph Déjacque, notable as the first person to describe himself as a "libertarian".[4][14] Against Proudhon, he argued that "it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature." He promulgated his ideas in his US published journal Le Libertaire (1858-1861).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However most other anarchists only moved towards communism some years later, following the death of Bakunin. The Italian section of the International was one of the first to embrace communism as a body at its 1876 congress.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The most important theorist of anarchist communism was Peter Kropotkin. Kropotkin outlined his economic ideas in The Conquest of Bread and Fields, Factories and Workshops Kropotkin's anarchism was based on his theory of mutual aid where co-operation is more beneficial than competition, illustrated in nature in Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1897). Subsequent anarchist communists include Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman. Many in the anarcho-syndicalist movements (see below) saw anarchist communism as their objective. Isaac Puente's 1932 Comunismo Libertario was adopted by the Spanish CNT as its manifesto for a post-revolutionary society.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Some anarchists disliked this merging of communism with anarchism. This view was held by several individualist anarchists, who maintained that abolition of private property was not consistent with liberty. For example, Benjamin Tucker, whilst professing respect for Kropotkin and publishing his work[5], described communist anarchism as "pseudo-anarchism".[12]</dd>
</dl>
<p>This section changed recently. It seems that it has grown in size while the others have shrunk in size (unless it just looks that way because everything else is shorter). Lets keep it concise. I also wouldn't agree that the majority of anarchists became communist ones in the 1870s. This version seems more POV than the previous version. <a href="../../../c/j/a/User%7ECJames745_5bd8.html" title="User:CJames745">CJames745</a> 00:38, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Anarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent, due mainly to a number of high-profile violent acts, including <a href="../../../r/i/o/Riot.html" title="Riot">riots</a>, <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assassination.html" title="Assassination">assassinations</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insurrection.html" title="Insurrection">insurrections</a>, and <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a> by some anarchists. Some <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolution.html" title="Revolution">revolutionaries</a> of the late 19th century encouraged acts of political violence, such as <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bomb.html" title="Bomb">bombings</a> and the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assassination.html" title="Assassination">assassinations</a> of <a href="../../../h/e/a/Head_of_state.html" title="Head of state">heads of state</a> to further anarchism. Such actions have sometimes been called '<a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda_by_the_deed.html" title="Propaganda by the deed">propaganda by the deed</a>'. However, Paul Brousse (1844-1912), who was one of the first anarchists to popularize "propaganda by the deed," did not advocate terrorism. For him, and many other anarchists, "propaganda by the deed" means exemplary forms of direct action meant to inspire the masses to revolution. In his article entitled "Propaganda by the Deed," published in the August 1877 Bulletin of the Jura Federation, Brousse spoke about teaching the people "socialism by means of actions... propaganda by the deed is a mighty means of rousing the popular consciousness." [Reprinted in Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas - Volume One: From Anarchy to Anarchism (300CE-1939), ed. Robert Graham [<a href="http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>] Similarly, in his 1870 publication, "Letters to a Frenchman on the Present Crisis," Bakunin wrote that "we must spread our principles, not with words but with deeds, for this is the most popular, the most potent, and the most irresistible form of propaganda." [<a href="http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1870/letter-frenchman.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1870/letter-frenchman.htm" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>]</p>
