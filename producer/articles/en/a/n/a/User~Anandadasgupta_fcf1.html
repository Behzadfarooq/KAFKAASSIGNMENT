<p>Dr. Ananda Das Gupta has been engaged in teaching/Research for more than eighteen years in different universities/Institute across the country like North Eastern Hill University (Central university) as Head of the Department of Commerce at Aizawl, as Academic Counsellor to Indira Gandhi National Open University (North Eastern Regional Centre) as Associate Faculty at Vivekananda Centre for Indian Management (VCIM) in Indore, and currently is holding Faculty- Chair in Business Law, OD, HRD and Business Ethics at Indian Institute of Plantation Management, Bangalore- a national level sectoral management school set up at the initiative of Ministry of Commerce, Government of India, and approved by AICTE.</p>
<p>He did his Doctoral work from Faculty of Commerce and Business Management, University of Patna as a UGC Research Fellow on the Operational Problems of the Small Scale sector in India with special reference to Bihar State wherein he conducted a number of field surveys, by administering structured questionnaires on the target group, having attached mainly to:A.N.Sinha Institute of Social Studies,Patna, Social Science Centre,Calcutta, NIESBUD, New Delhi etc. and did gather data on an extensive scale to probe into the problems focused.</p>
<p>Findings: It has been found in the research work that the lack of three vital aspects-namely: Human Resource Management of the Labour force in the informal sector, value orientation of the entrepreneurs and overall forward-looking management system leads to a total chaos that is quantified by the lackadaisical measures taken by the Government for the real development that has yet to take place instead of over-publicized political gimmicks and statistical jugglery to turn the entropy into an ordered system.</p>
<p>A Life Fellow of Indian Academy of Social Sciences and a Member of the Indian Society of Labour Economics, he is a recognized Doctoral Supervisor of the following Universities-Manipur University (the erstwhile Post Graduate Campus of JNU), Imphal, Aligarh Muslim University, U.P. , Vidyasagar University , West Bengal and Amaravati University, Maharastra.</p>

<p>• Congratulations on your new book. There is a great need for research and case development , in this emerging field in Business , the boundaries of which are being continually stretched , by ruthless competition . Is there an inverse proportionality between competition and ethical behaviour in Business? This is the question to be addressed , and perhaps a saner business model will emerge where productivity and profitability can exist honourably within an ethical business framework . I await with interest, the publication of your book.</p>
<p>Prof. Kalyan Chakravarti ,Dean , Vinod gupta school of Management ,Indian Institute of Technology , Kharqagpur</p>

• Thanks very much for this note. I have to say I had forgotten all about this and am delighted that it is going ahead with Ashgate. I hope it is picked up and distributed fairly widely. I will be in Bangalore in Jan-Feb 2005 at IIMB as in past years and would be good to catch up with you whilst I am there. I hope we can catch up.

• 'This book is a collection of ideas on business ethics confronting individuals, organizations and society. Every author is of the opinion that, for a business house, freedom to operate is not a license to abuse the business. Therefore, the profit must be ethical, moral and, above all, for the welfare of the society in which it functions. The book thus provides a framework of actions for every practicing manager.'</p>
<p>Dr. M.B. Sharan, Professor and Former Head, Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur</p>
<p>• 'The book is a valuable contribution to the emerging field of ethics and values in management. The editor has compiled articles from a varied cross-section of scholars from multiple disciplines and different cultural backgrounds to provide the readers with global perspectives on this vital issue.'</p>

<p>• Congratulations to your achievement! It looks like a very interesting book that I am looking forward to read. I hope the publisher will send me a copy.</p>
<pre>
      Feel free to send your revised manuscript entitled Ethics in Business whenever you can. I   
      shall be  happy to write a preface to it.

<p>• Congratulations on your success. I am happy to review the book edited by you in our international journal: Journal of Corporate Citizenship. Looking forward to meeting you whenever I am in India</p>
<p>Prof. David Birch Centre for Corporate Social Responsibility Deakin University, Australia</p>
<p>• The subject of the proposed book is interesting and important, indeed. In principle, we could include the volume in our series "Contributions to Economics" or "Contributions to Management Science", which appear in the programme of Physica-Verlag, a Springer-Verlag company; the Physica titles are fully integrated into all promotional activities of Springer-Verlag. The series contain publications in the fields of economics and management science.</p>
