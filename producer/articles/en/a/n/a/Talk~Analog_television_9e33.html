<p>This doesn't seem fair!!! What about all the people who don't have the equipment to receive digital broadcasts??? What are we supposed to tell them??? Sounds a little "right-wing", don't you think??? --<b><a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWIKISCRIPPS_07_7909.html" title="User talk:WIKISCRIPPS 07">WIKISCRIPPS 07</a></b> SUN SEP 24 2006 2:43 PM EDT</p>
<p>Here's the deal: Those who still have analog TVs without tuners capable of getting ATSC signals, will likely be given a set-top box at discount. That, though will be a minimal problem, as the law already mandates that any television over 27 inches (around that at least) must have an ATSC compatible tuner.</p>
<p>I think smaller TVs will be required to have this compatibility soon enough. At the rate most people go through televisions, ATSC, Digital TV and HDTV will come on the scene with much fewer problems than you think. Serkali 06:24, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Mardus, of course it is OK for an article to talk mostly about the subject and briefly cover the related topics. However, the section "Comparison of analog and digital television" should really be called "Advantages of analog over digital television". If a page is going to compare the subject with related subjects, it should compare them in a fair and balanced way. The reason everywhere is changing to digital is that it is superior to analog overall. The only advantage of digital listed by the editor of this section is the fact that it can deal with a low power signal without breaking up. This section is definitely a one sided view. <a href="../../../h/p/e/User%7EHpesoj00_8068.html" title="User:Hpesoj00">Hpesoj00</a> 13:37, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do concur with this. One disadvantage of digital television is that older TV equipment that still works cannot be used to receive the signal. But there should therefore be more advantages listed, because I don't feel that just one advantage is enough reason to switch. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMardus_190a.html" title="User:Mardus">Mardus</a> 17:35, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is very difficult to compare analogue and digital television picture 'dynamics' quality by viewing as current day broadcasts, the best that can be done at present is to find VHS recordings of TV programs made when the analog signal was maintained, such as in the early 90's. If you don't beleive me, try it and see for yourself- look for the picture movement, one looks more like real-life, the other looks like moving computer graphics. Analogue RF signals nowdays are not maintained, they are allowed to degrade, making it difficult to see the picture without snow and of course is still subject to the effects of digital compression which may be used now to save bandwidth in the transport feed. The difference A and D TV can be equated to the difference between an original audio CD and an 'all-digitally-mastered' MP3 download of the same 70's or early 80's track, the latter of course sounds as though it is heard through short-wave radio, listen for the varying timbre of fuzz-guitar which MP3 cannot recreate very well. Comparing a CD with a vinyl record in order to illustrate the difference between A and D TV is completely absurd, because an audio CD is still the analogue representation of sound waveform, just as is vinyl record is. It would be fairer to compare the vinyl record (equivalent to 1 gigabyte of data) to MP3 (typically 0.08 gigabyte). If MP3 was relased in the early 80's instead of the Philips Audio Compact Disc, it would most certainly of flopped, as magazine shelves were full of 'hi-fi enthusiasts' magazines which had articles on listening tests tonal qualities of loudspeaker cables on the most expensive gear in the world. Mass-market digital camera technology is beginning to catch up with professional camera film, (medium-format ektachrome 25 is equivalent to something like 200 megapixels). In the same way, digital TV will one day in the future not need to rely so heavily on bandwidth compression to deliver a stream, it could allow more naturally appearing movement, if more bandwidth is available. The primitive digital tv of today is currently in the dark ages, it has a long way to go yet.</p>
<p>A flower growing is nature's highest form of digital compression. The image of it on our retina is nature's analogue TV. Which is the best compromise of these two to project the image of a flower swaying in a breeze? The answer will always change, depending on current technology, the accountants, market forces. We are presently at the stage of manipulated computer graphics representing the flower, for HD we are increasing the number of pixels. --MarkRBarker 19:51, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hate to disagree with you Hpesoj00, but the driving forces to DTV includes the re-allocation of the frequencies to be used for other communications uses and addition of additional channels and ancillary services that can be transmitted by the broadcaster. HiDef HDTV development was started to increase the quality of the broadcast image to the viewer. After General Instrument, Inc. found a way to use the rapidly evolving digital technology to pack more information (pixels, bits...) into the same bandwidth of the existing channels some additional "features" came to light at the expense of being compatible with the existing television receivers. The broadcaster could transmit one really high quality image...or several with lower quality. Some even lower than current analog. Deliver several poor quality programs when the initial promise/goal was for high quality images. And Digital DTV can add additional communications data services not related to pictures or sound. The idea of "Channel 4" getting licensed to broadcast several more channels seems at the first glance to be a windfall for the broadcaster. Sadly, getting four times as many channels in a community will not generate four times the ad revenue as the population in the community stays fixed. (duh) Currently the broadcasters are running both analog and digital on different frequencies. Waste of bandwidth and electricity. Digital TV can offer images vastly superior images, but the quality can be reduced at will leading to annoying motion artifacts, quantizing/contouring artifacts noticeable in dark scenes, and image breakup should the electronics simply not be able to keep up with the data. In the end I have to agree that the page seems to tilted to being a proponent of the analog system and perhaps a POV issue could be resolved with more detailed discussion. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldZeb_6cd1.html" title="User:OldZeb">OldZeb</a> 06:26, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I guess you were disagreeing with "digital is better than analog overall", I suppose it depends who you ask, it is a rather subjective topic. The section seems to have been balanced out a bit better now, but the information is still not presented in a very well organized manner. I may attempt to neaten it up if I find myself with nothing to do, but I am no master of the subject so maybe it should be better done by someone who knows what they are talking about. <a href="../../../h/p/e/User%7EHpesoj00_8068.html" title="User:Hpesoj00">Hpesoj00</a> 10:55, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Aside from the comments on POV already, with the tedious discussion above. There are a few things in this section which I don't think are true at all. A few points if I may.</p>
<p>Analogue and digital tv signals, in standard definition at least, are both formed of 50/60 interlaced fields per second. No difference in frame rate. I'd also query the comment on redundancy in the picture signal, an analogous representation of something is inherently redundant since it is an analogue of something and does not resemble a white noise signal which has the highest information density.</p>
<p>The MPEG compression used in digital TV has chroma subsampling (as do most other compressed video formats) comparable in many ways to the lesser bandwidth used for colour information in PAL/NTSC analogue signals.</p>
<p>The point on the uncompressed data rate of a digital signal is arguable superflous since the main argument in favour of digital television (or as far as the authorities are concerned at least) is the reduction in bandwith used. Transmitting an uncompressed signal would be impractical and pointless. Needless to say it is nowhere near as large as 250Gb/sec. Also note that 250Gb/sec does not in any way nescessarily equate to 250Ghz of bandwidth, this would depend on the modulation used and could be vastly less, though this is irrelevant anyway. I have no idea where the 250 number has come from. (Actually I think I've worked out where this may have come from now, 720 * 576 * 3 * 25 * 8 is 248832000, is about 250 Mbit/s though this assumes no chroma subsampling with 24 bits per pixel, still out by a multiple of 1000 though) (One further addition, 250Mbit/s could comfortably fit in a 6Mhz wide channel with some not too rediculously dense modulation, although this signal would not be very robust and no space would have been saved)</p>
<p>The last paragraph should be scrapped I think also. The degredation of an analogue signal in less than perfect conditions may be more pleasant to watch but it is in no way "predictable". As far as the unpacking of audio whilst constructing a picture, the complexity of the process should not be a point against it as long as it works. In my mind the signal processing of an analogue picture is in no way simple either.</p>

<p>I dont really understand how an analog television broadcast can have a resolution per se, because it isn't it just like film in that it depends on what resolution you scan it at to determin the acutall resolution?<a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodrigue_9393.html" title="User:Rodrigue">Rodrigue</a> 13:31, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>In a conventional television the picture is constructed by a scanning electron beam line by line (this is where the vertical resolution comes from). There is no horizontal resolution so to speak of in this context, although all modern television signals are from a digital source and the horizontal resolution people speak of just comes from whatever the proportional amount of elements would be required to provide the same resolution as in the vertical dimension.</p>
