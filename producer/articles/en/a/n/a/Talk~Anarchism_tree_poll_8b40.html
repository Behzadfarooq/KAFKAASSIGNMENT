Three similar attempts have been deleted by consensus at IfD for violation of NPOV and original research policy (votes: <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImages_and_media_for_deletion_2006_January_23_6419.html" title="Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion/2006 January 23">6-1</a>, <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImages_and_media_for_deletion_2006_January_25_89e8.html" title="Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion/2006 January 25">5-1</a>, <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImages_and_media_for_deletion_2006_January_26_2c07.html" title="Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion/2006 January 26">4-1</a>; all opposition votes came from Hogeye).

<p>Proponents:</p>

<p>Opponents:</p>
<ul>
<li>argue that this is simply stringing together sources, interpreting them in a way beneficial to one POV; sources could be strung together in any number of ways</li>
<li>argue that the chart is a POV attempt using original research to justify anarcho-capitalism as a form of anarchism, even though extensive sourcing shows it is clearly <i>not</i> original research</li>
<li>that in order to create the simplification needed for a 2-D diagram everything is reduced to interpreting anarchism in terms of economic theory (whether people supported property etc.), which is how ancap researchers may see anarchism but not how anyone else does.</li>
<li>feel that the chart violates the undue weight clause of NPOV policy, with the largest piece of the tree dedicated to a very controversial faction.</li>

<dd>You can not seriously call Stirner a capitalist, not a man who was a member of the Left Hegellians, who attacked <i>The Wealth of Nations</i> on every point (and concidered it a personal failure when he was forced to translate because of his debts).</dd>
<dd>Another point - the direct link between Stirner and Nietzsche is not commonly accepted - similarities, a common spirit yes, but direct link, no (small discussion on the Nietzsche talk page). That slightly irrelevant since Rand broke with Nietzsche's writings long before she became a significant anarcho-capitalist (or right-libertarian, take your pick) figure. It would be more convincing to link directly from Stirner to whomever, though one would lose the convenient mention of better-known figures at the price of accuracy. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_Intentions_d6f9.html" title="User:Good Intentions">Marinus</a> 15:16, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not by the modern definition of socialism, which necessitates favoring collective ownership. See the many citations esp in the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Individualist_anarchist.html" title="Individualist anarchist">Individualist anarchist</a> article, in the section about comparisons of property systems.
<dl>
<dd>There still is a distinction between socialism (parent class) and collectivism (sub class), despite more than 6 decades of anti-communist propoganda. Also, Tucker (unless my memory is mistaken) proposed a system of use-ownership (as long as you use something it's yours, the exact term escapes me at the moment) rather than private ownership, which is itself a socialist position. I'm concerned that that comparison of property systems doesn't show use-ownership, which is hugely important to mutualism. Despite Tucker's adherence to contract theory, he can't be said to have been a capitalist. He quite squarely was an anti-capitalist, even if he did not make this as central a component of his thought as the European anarchists were in the habit of doing. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_Intentions_d6f9.html" title="User:Good Intentions">Marinus</a> 14:35, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Right; it can be applied to anarchists who are socialist. "Socialist" is not a "meaningless" adjective. The logic of this claim escapes me.

I dunno. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 16:26, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Up until Marx, socialism and anarchism was an interchangable term. Even the anarcho-capitalism article on Wiki makes the distinction between anarchism and anarcho-capitalism.

<dd>It's not a clarification, it's an encoding: an encoding of a movement as a series of individuals, without reference to the movement itself (its events, tendencies, etc).

<li>Yes, me, MrVoluntarist, (though perhaps with minor changes -- the idea itself is okay). It would be a good idea to summarize a large amount of information into a picture. Everything claimed by the tree (with some exceptions I've noted before) is well-documented. It doesn't simplify any more than Wikipedia already does through summarization of any given philosopher's arguments. <a href="../../../m/r/v/User%7EMrVoluntarist_23fd.html" title="User:MrVoluntarist">MrVoluntarist</a> 18:18, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think it's doable. But, the people complaining about it just don't want to take the effort to do it, and that's fine, because it is a hassle. But, it's certainly not "inherently POV." The same information could be said in words --this is just putting it in chart form (and is very effective). The major problem though is that it's not interactive. Normally, if I disagree with something in Wikipedia, I can just go in and change it on my own. But with the chart, I have to make a request to Hogeye or someone else that has access to the software to modify it, and, then it's up to them whether they're going to make my changes for me or not. Maybe if everybody, including myself, got the software, it could be much easier. But, honestly, I can't see it working out in the long term because there's always going to be people without the software that want to make a change but can't. But, then, nothing works out in the long term on Wikipedia anyway. Everything in the article today will be erased many times over in the course of time --it's naive to think otherwise. So, as a matter of exercise I'm willing to give it a shot. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 16:00, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The thing is that the tree removes the thoughts from their context, which is a bit silly concidering that the tree is supposed to describe the context and not the thinkers (if it were to be NPOV).

<li>Theoretically I am open to the possibility there might be an NPOV tree, in which each link and node is perfectly placed to represent significance of every thinker, planted somewhere in the Platonic world of ideals. But the chance of us replicating anything like it here, with the multi-year POV war on the anarchism page, approaches zero.<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBengalski_c6f3.html" title="User:Bengalski">Bengalski</a> 12:42, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think the main reason such a catogorisation will always fail at representing reality accurately is because it consentrates entirely on individuals, whereas any political movement/tradition is a social one. This presentation hides the actual existence of a movement (in this case, anarchism), makes no mention of the events which shaped the movement much more than any individual could (the Paris Commune, the First International, Anarchist Spain, etc). It gives equal weightings to groups of decisively different influence (a quick glance makes Rothbard appear as influential in anarchism as say Proudhon, who as an individual and a theorist was arguably the most important of <i>all</i> anti-capitalists before Marx, whereas Rothbard, whatever else he was, is a figure in a largely peripheral group). It misrepresents a social movement as a progression of individuals, a belief that suits hero-worship and emphatically <i>not</i> analysis.In all honesty I believe this representation is an attempt to give the extreme-minority position of anarcho-capitalism (the "anarchism" of which is not at all accepted by the vast majority of practicing anarchists) a greater appearance of consequence than a portrayal of anarchism as a social movement (ie as what it is) would. It also commits the fallacy of defining something by its practicioners rather than by its practice. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_Intentions_d6f9.html" title="User:Good Intentions">Marinus</a> 12:34, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The tree is a waste of time. With interlinked wikipages the intelligent reader can move through a serious of links which avoids this essentially <a href="../../../c/o/n/Containment_hierarchy.html" title="Containment hierarchy">hierarchical</a> and two dimensional way of presenting material. I don't think it has any place in wikipedia, and perhaps the people who seem intent on discussing it could find another site where they could tinker with various refinements to their hearts content, as suggested below. As mentioned above, a NPOV tree <i>"might"</i> be possible in <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plato.html" title="Plato">Platonic</a> world of ideals, but whether such a world could exist is clearly POV (See <a href="../../../n/o/m/Nominalism.html" title="Nominalism">Nominalism</a>).
