<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarky.html" title="Edit section: Publication history">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Publication history</span></h2>
<p>Originally inspired by <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Moore_f74a.html" title="Alan Moore">Alan Moore's</a> <i><a href="../../../v/_/f/V_for_Vendetta_4f55.html" title="V for Vendetta">V for Vendetta</a></i>, and early incarnations of <a href="../../../c/h/o/Chopper_%28Judge_Dredd_character%29_6401.html" title="Chopper (Judge Dredd character)">Chopper</a>, from <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judge_Dredd_b7a6.html" title="Judge Dredd">Judge Dredd</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Grant_7637.html" title="Alan Grant">Alan Grant</a> imagined the character as a twelve-year-old <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchist</a> vigilante. His only instructions to his partner, illustrator <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norm_Breyfogle_5025.html" title="Norm Breyfogle">Norm Breyfogle</a>, were that Anarky be designed as a cross between <a href="../../../v/_/%28/V_%28character%29.html" title="V (character)">V</a> and the black spy from <i><a href="../../../m/a/d/Mad_%28magazine%29.html" title="Mad (magazine)">Mad</a></i> magazine's <i><a href="../../../s/p/y/Spy_vs._Spy_6068.html" title="Spy vs. Spy">Spy vs. Spy</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> In response to deadline pressures, and not recognizing the character's potential, Breyfogle "made no preliminary sketches, simply draping him in long red sheets." He was also intended to wear a costume that disguised his youth, and so was fitted with a crude "head extender" that elongated his neck, creating a jarring appearance. While both of these design elements have since been dropped, more enduring aspects of the character have been his golden face mask, "priestly" hat, and his golden <a href="../../../s/t/a/Staff_%28stick%29.html" title="Staff (stick)">staff</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The first Anarky story, "<i>Anarky in Gotham City, Part 1: Letters to the Editor</i>," appeared in <i>Detective Comics #608</i>, in November 1989. In Grant's earliest script for the character, Anarky was designed to be far more vicious, and to have killed his first victim. However, <a href="../../../d/e/n/Dennis_O%27Neil_3c18.html" title="Dennis O'Neil">Dennis O'Neil</a>, then editor of Detective Comics, requested that Grant "tone down" the script, as he felt Anarky becoming a murderer at such a young age was morally reprehensible. Grant consented to the request and the script was rewritten; a move he later considered for the best.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> In a 2004 interview, Grant explained the motivation behind this early decision:</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>I wanted to play it that way because it created incredible tension in Anarky himself. Other heroes might kill--Batman used to, in the early days--but for a teenager to rationally decide to take lives...well, it hadn't been handled in comics before. But Denny was boss, and I respected his opinion and toned things down.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>Although Grant had not created the character to be used beyond the two-part debut story, reader reaction and encouragement from his editor caused him to change his mind. He then decided to make Lonnie Machin the third <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_%28comics%29.html" title="Robin (comics)">Robin</a>, following <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Todd_d1c6.html" title="Jason Todd">Jason Todd</a>, desiring a new <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sidekick.html" title="Sidekick">sidekick</a> who would act as a <a href="../../../f/o/i/Foil_%28literature%29.html" title="Foil (literature)">foil</a> to Batman, and not have the same motivations for vengeance. However, this was abandoned when he learned that <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_%28Tim_Drake%29_68f1.html" title="Robin (Tim Drake)">Tim Drake</a> had already been created to fill the role by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marv_Wolfman_a37d.html" title="Marv Wolfman">Marv Wolfman</a>.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>In May of 1997, a four-issue Anarky mini-series, <i><a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarky_%28comic_book%29.html" title="Anarky (comic book)">Anarky</a></i>, was produced. The story, entitled "<i>Metamorphosis</i>," maintained the character's anti-authoritarian sentiments, but was instead based on the philosophy of <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_R._Wallace_ae51.html" title="Frank R. Wallace">Neo-Tech</a>, an offshoot of <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objectivism_%28Ayn_Rand%29_e3e6.html" title="Objectivism (Ayn Rand)">Objectivism</a>.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> Its success fueled the creation of a <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_paperback.html" title="Trade paperback">trade paperback</a>, collecting several of his appearances. With the continuing success of the character, Darren Vincenzo, then an editorial assistant, suggested continuing the book as an ongoing series to Norm Breyfogle, provided Alan Grant would continue as the writer. Although Grant was concerned that such a series would not be viable, he agreed to write the series at Breyfogle's insistence.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup> He later explained his apprehension in an interview:</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>Anarky, not having any super powers, doesn’t have what it takes to bring the fans in month after month. He’s the sort of character you can get away with using in an annual once a year plus his own mini-series once a year and maybe as a guest star every couple of years, but he’s not capable, he’s not strong enough to hold his own monthly title. Very few characters are when it comes down to it. I’m not sure how long ago, I think back in the ‘70s, DC released <a href="../../../j/o/k/Joker_%28comics%29.html" title="Joker (comics)">The Joker</a> in his own monthly comic and I think it lasted seven or eight issues, which was basically the same as the Anarky one we did.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Grant's doubts eventually proved true. The series, <i><a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarky_%28comic_book%29.html" title="Anarky (comic book)">Anarky</a></i>, was panned by critics, failed to catch on among readers, and was canceled after eight issues. However, Grant has noted in an interview that it was popular in <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_America_9663.html" title="South America">South America</a>, perhaps owing to a history of political repression in the region.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the last issue of the <i>Anarky</i> series, the possibility was left open that <a href="../../../j/o/k/Joker_%28comics%29.html" title="Joker (comics)">The Joker</a> might be Anarky's actual father. But as the series is now canceled, it may be some time before this theory is addressed. However, Alan Grant has said on the website Silver Bullet Comics that a senior <a href="../../../d/c/_/DC_Comics_9a75.html" title="DC Comics">DC Comics</a> official told him:</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>'Anarky will never be the Joker's son. You can write the story, but someone else will write the sequel showing it just can't be.'<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later, in a dual interview with Breyfogle, Grant explained the situation behind the decision in greater detail, including that it was originally Norm's idea to make Anarky the son of The Joker, and that it was <a href="../../../d/e/n/Dennis_O%27Neil_3c18.html" title="Dennis O'Neil">Dennis O'Neil</a> who protested against it:</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>Denny only let me write that story under protest, he was totally opposed to Joker being Anarky’s father and said under no circumstances would DC allow that... I talked him into letting me write the script anyway by saying the story would create a lot of interest and then maybe in six months time I would write the rebuttal, which proves that Anarky wasn’t the Joker’s son, (...) and Denny said OK but of course the monthly title got cancelled long before that point.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further, Grant speculates that as Dennis O'Neil is no longer in charge of such decisions at DC Comics, with the final editorial decision now belonging to <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Didio_50b2.html" title="Dan Didio">Dan Didio</a>, it is no longer possible to be sure whether a rebuttal will ever be published.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup> For his part, there is no record of Didio ever commenting on the subject. However, it is worth noting that chronologically, the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_the_DC_Universe_4e02.html" title="Timeline of the DC Universe">DC Universe timeline</a> prevents the Joker from being Anarky's biological father, as Lonnie is (currently) approximately sixteen years old, while the Joker has only existed for approximately ten years.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>As Anarky was created while Grant and Breyfogle were operating under "work-for-hire" rules, <a href="../../../d/c/_/DC_Comics_9a75.html" title="DC Comics">DC Comics</a> owns all rights to the Anarky character. Both men later attempted to buy the rights to Anarky from the company, but their offer was declined.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarky.html" title="Edit section: Political themes and reception">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Political themes and reception</span></h3>
<p>Originally, Alan Grant created Anarky as an <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchist</a> with <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist.html" title="Socialist">socialist</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/p/Populist.html" title="Populist">populist</a> leanings. In this early incarnation, Anarky was designed as an avatar for Grant's personal meditations on political philosophy, and specifically for his burgeoning sympathy for anarchism. However, according to Grant, anarchists with whom he associated were hostile to his creation of the character, seeing it as an act of <a href="../../../c/o/-/Co-optation.html" title="Co-optation">cooptation</a> for commercial gain.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>

<p>Within the books, the nature of the character's political opinions were often expressed through the character's rhetoric, and by heavy use of the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchist_symbolism.html#Circle-A" title="Anarchist symbolism">Circle-A</a> as a character gimmick. Other themes often used whenever Anarky was a featured character in a comic were politically charged graffiti along city streets,<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[17]</a></sup> and fluttering newspapers bearing headlines which alluded to social problems, such as white collar crime, or rising poverty rates.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[18]</a></sup> Occasionally, the titles of political books found in Anarky's room would express the character's political agenda. In <i><a href="../../../d/e/t/Detective_Comics_f034.html" title="Detective Comics">Detective Comics</a></i> #620, a copy of <i><a href="../../../v/_/f/V_for_Vendetta_%28comic%29_8e4b.html" title="V for Vendetta (comic)">V For Vendetta</a></i> can be seen on Lonnie Machin's bookshelf, as homage. Other books in his room include <i>Apostles of Revolution</i> by Max Nomad, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Anarchists_5bb1.html" title="The Anarchists">The Anarchists</a></i> by James Joll, books labeled "<i><a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon_876a.html" title="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">Proudhon</a></i>" and "<i><a href="../../../m/i/k/Mikhail_Bakunin_11a1.html" title="Mikhail Bakunin">Bakunin</a></i>," and an issue of <i><a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Flag_%28newspaper%29_a7e8.html" title="Black Flag (newspaper)">Black Flag</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>Over the course of several years, Grant's political opinions changed, and when he was given the opportunity to write an <i>Anarky</i> mini-series, he decided to redesign the character accordingly. Alan Grant later explained his reasoning for this in an interview:</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>I felt he was the perfect character (to express <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_R._Wallace_ae51.html" title="Frank R. Wallace">Neo-Tech</a> philosophy) because he's human, he has no special powers, the only power he's got is the power of his own rational consciousness.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the <i><a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarky_%28comic_book%29.html" title="Anarky (comic book)">Anarky</a></i> series led the character away from the philosophy he had espoused previously, the theme of the character remained "<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-statism.html" title="Anti-statism">anti-statism</a>", and this particular interpretation of Anarky was specific to Alan Grant. As the character has since seen little exposure in DC publications (as of 2007), it is not possible to judge if the character's philosophy has been permanently changed.</p>
<p>Following the publication of an issue of <i><a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Arrow_bfe4.html" title="Green Arrow">Green Arrow</a></i> in which Anarky guest-stared, writer James Peatty juxtaposed Anarky's radical philosophy with the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressivism.html" title="Progressivism">liberal progressive</a> beliefs of Green Arrow:</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>Everyone always goes on about what a radical Ollie is and I wanted to show that maybe that isn’t the case … especially as Ollie’s radical credentials are pretty antiquated, (...) Anarky as a character - and as a broader idea - is much more radical than Ollie...<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In at least one review of the <i><a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarky_%28comic_book%29.html" title="Anarky (comic book)">Anarky</a></i> series, Anarky has been dubbed the first "anti-villain", as opposed to "<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-hero.html" title="Anti-hero">anti-hero</a>". This is due to his highly principled philosophy running counter to most villains, but which also logically leads to his willingness to break laws, putting him at odds with mainstream heroes:</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>In the age of the anti-hero, it only makes sense to have the occasional anti-villain as well. But unlike sociopathic vigilante anti-heroes like the <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punisher.html" title="Punisher">Punisher</a>, an anti-villain like Anarky provides some interesting food for thought. Sure, he breaks the law, but what he really wants is to save the world... and maybe he's <i>right</i>.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarky.html" title="Edit section: Absence from DC continuity">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Absence from DC continuity</span></h3>
<p>Prior to the ongoing series, Anarky had appeared in a small number of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman.html" title="Batman">Batman</a> titles, as well as <i><a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Arrow_bfe4.html" title="Green Arrow">Green Arrow</a></i>, <i>DCU Heroes - Secret Files and Origins</i>, and <i><a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_%28comics%29.html" title="Robin (comics)">Robin</a></i>. Immediately after the end of his ongoing series in 1999, Anarky made three sporadic cameos in <i><a href="../../../y/o/u/Young_Justice_6d4f.html" title="Young Justice">Young Justice</a></i>, the <i>Sins of Youth</i> <a href="../../../f/i/f/Fifth-week_event.html" title="Fifth-week event">fifth-week event</a>, and <i><a href="../../../w/o/n/Wonder_Woman_0ea1.html" title="Wonder Woman">Wonder Woman</a></i>, followed by a period of absence which lasted several years and threatened to sentence the character to obscurity. During this period, Norm Breyfogle attempted to continue using the character in other comics, including an issue of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Spectre_f0ac.html" title="The Spectre">The Spectre</a> he co-wrote with <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._M._DeMatteis_b30a.html" title="J.

<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>(...) it would have been a really great story. I had it all worked out and DeMatteis was game for it. We proposed it to our editor and got the word back in a few days: no, it couldn’t be done. (...) I’ve generally gotten the impression that Anarky was nixed because of its philosophy. Especially in this age of post <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_2001_attacks.html" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">9/11</a>, Anarky would be a challenge to established authority. He’s very anti-establishment, that’s why he’s named Anarky!<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2005 Anarky made a prominent appearance billed as his return to DC continuity, in <i><a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Arrow_bfe4.html" title="Green Arrow">Green Arrow</a></i> #51, <i>Anarky in the USA</i>. Despite this "return," as of 2007 Anarky had yet to appear in another publication. However, during a panel at <i><a href="../../../w/o/n/WonderCon_1063.html" title="WonderCon">WonderCon</a> 2006</i>, multiple requests were made by the audience for Anarky to appear in DC Comic's limited series, "<i><a href="../../../5/2/_/52_%28comic_book%29.html" title="52 (comic book)">52</a></i>." As of result of which, Dan Didio announced two weeks later, at a DC Comics panel during <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Comic-Con_5136.html" title="New York Comic-Con">New York Comic-Con</a> 2006</i>, that the writing team of <i>52</i> had decided to create a part for the character.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>

</div>
<p><b>Lonnie Machin</b> was an ordinary child who had no great concerns in his life. At eleven he gained a foreign pen pal, Xuasus, as part of a school program. Every month they would write to each other about their lives; Lonnie about how wonderful the United States was; Xuasus about the poverty and political repression that made up his nation. After a year of contact, Xuasus stopped writing, and all of Lonnie's letters were returned as undeliverable. A year later Lonnie learned of Xuasus' fate. He wrote Lonnie a final letter explaining that his father had been arrested, his mother had taken ill, his sister had died of malnutrition, and at age eleven, he was homeless and fending for himself. Driven with worry for his friend, Lonnie fervently learned about Xuasus' country, discovering it to be a <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_World_e346.html" title="Third World">Third World</a> <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictatorship.html" title="Dictatorship">dictatorship</a> at war with <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marxist.html" title="Marxist">Marxist</a> guerrillas, with arms dealers from <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_world.html" title="Western world">The West</a> making millions in profits from the conflict.</p>
<p>Further studies into war and political violence led him to hold radical sympathies. He came to view all wars as being caused by political elites, with common individuals forced or cajoled into fighting on behalf of the former. He also began to read more into esoteric studies regarding science and philosophy, laying the groundwork for his advanced intelligence, and leading to his cover as a straight-A student with a normal job as a paper-boy. Eventually he discovered the extremely rare book, <i>Universe</i> by Scudder Klyce, which attempted to unify all knowledge. Within it he found several passages that convinced him of the need to reshape society. He became convinced that if he couldn't help Xuasus, he could fight on in his memory and give the oppressed people of <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gotham_City_7766.html" title="Gotham City">Gotham City</a> hope.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
<p>Inspired by the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman.html" title="Batman">Batman</a>, he fashioned a <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electroshock_weapon.html" title="Electroshock weapon">stun baton</a> and <a href="../../../s/m/o/Smoke_bombs.html" title="Smoke bombs">smoke bombs</a> in labs at school. He went to further lengths by creating a costume with a false head to increase his height and disguise the fact that he was only twelve. He then created computer files in which he made psychological profiles of Batman, to determine how best to defeat him when they inevitably came into conflict.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>

<p>He made his debut as <b>Anarky</b> by responding to complaints in the newspaper by attacking the offending sources, such as the owner of a factory whose byproduct waste was polluting the water.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[27]</a></sup> Anarky and Batman ultimately came to blows, and during their brief fight, Batman deduced that Anarky was actually a young child. During this first confrontation, he was aided by a band of homeless men, including Legs, a homeless cripple who became loyal to him. After being caught, Lonnie was locked away in a juvenile detention center.</p>
<p>During his detention, he increased his computer skills to the point of becoming an advanced <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grey_hat.html" title="Grey hat">"grey hat"</a> computer <a href="../../../h/a/c/Hacker.html" title="Hacker">hacker</a>. He took on the <a href="../../../s/c/r/Screen_name_%28computing%29.html" title="Screen name (computing)">online alias</a> "Moneyspider" to steal millions of dollars from western corporations, including <a href="../../../w/a/y/Wayne_Enterprises_0222.html" title="Wayne Enterprises">Wayne Enterprises</a>, and outmaneuvering Batman's own data security in the process. He then used the money to create bank accounts for poor farmers in third world countries. He was eventually caught by <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_%28Tim_Drake%29_68f1.html" title="Robin (Tim Drake)">Tim Drake</a> in the latter's first solo detective case.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>After this setback he frequently escaped from the center and peregrinated around <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gotham_City_7766.html" title="Gotham City">Gotham City</a>, most notably during the <a href="../../../k/n/i/Batman%7E_Knightfall_428d.html" title="Batman: Knightfall">Knightfall</a> saga when he took on both <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scarecrow_%28comics%29.html" title="Scarecrow (comics)">Scarecrow</a> and <a href="../../../a/z/r/Azrael_%28comics%29.html" title="Azrael (comics)">Batman-Azrael</a>. He was known to continue relying on the homeless community for support, such as when Legs and other homeless men distracted a guard long enough for him to switch political ads to give anti-voting messages.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[29]</a></sup> In a rare, heroic portrayal during this early period of his career, he teamed up with <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Arrow_bfe4.html" title="Green Arrow">Green Arrow</a> to destroy a weapons manufacturing plant.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>Upon his release, Lonnie built a machine that allowed him to fuse both hemispheres of his brain, giving him increased intelligence, and what he perceived as <a href="../../../e/n/l/Enlightenment_%28concept%29.html" title="Enlightenment (concept)">enlightenment</a>. Creating an online bookstore, <i>Anarco</i>, to propagate radical literature, he began to accumulate funds which he donated through another front company, <i>The Anarkist Foundation</i>, to radical organizations, such as eco-warriors and gun protesters, or kept for his own projects.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[31]</a></sup> As Anarky, he eventually chose to shed the encumbrance of his double life, and faked his death. He then worked in seclusion to further his goal of achieving an <a href="../../../u/t/o/Utopia.html" title="Utopia">utopian</a> society, briefly hiring Legs and other homeless men to monitor Batman's movements. He had several further brushes with Batman, as well as the likes of <a href="../../../e/t/r/Etrigan.html" title="Etrigan">Etrigan</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darkseid.html" title="Darkseid">Darkseid</a>.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[32]</a></sup> Following the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Batman%7E_Cataclysm_1c22.html" title="Batman: Cataclysm">earthquake in Gotham</a> Lonnie's parents disappeared, their house was destroyed, and he was threatened by Batman to leave the city. As one of many refugees who escaped from <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_Man%27s_Land_%28comics%29_ddf2.html" title="No Man's Land (comics)">No Man's Land</a>, he relocated to a new base of operations beneath the <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Monument_ef56.html" title="Washington Monument">Washington Monument</a>.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>
<p>Beginning a search for his missing parents, he came upon evidence that the Machins were not in fact his biological parents, and attempted to track down his "real" parents. His leads pointed to the possibility that his biological father was in fact the <a href="../../../j/o/k/Joker_%28comics%29.html" title="Joker (comics)">Joker</a>. He met his supposed biological mother first, but found that she was clinically unstable and unable to answer his questions. He then broke into <a href="../../../a/r/k/Arkham_Asylum_f9b6.html" title="Arkham Asylum">Arkham Asylum</a> to confront the Joker himself, but was betrayed, as the Joker opportunistically attempted to escape from the Asylum without providing any firm answers.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>
<p>Anarky resurfaced months later in response to two events. The first was the government and media persecution of <a href="../../../y/o/u/Young_Justice_6d4f.html" title="Young Justice">Young Justice</a>, showing up at a public rally of super heroes to lend moral support (though as a reference to his absence from DC continuity, the local media reporters didn't recognize him, referring to him as "some woman with a stick," and <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donna_Troy_5a8c.html" title="Donna Troy">Donna Troy</a> confused his name, calling him "Chaos"') After the protest rally was interrupted and a government crackdown began, he aided the <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_League_047b.html" title="Justice League">Justice League</a> in making their escape. The second event was a bombing in <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_City_%28comics%29_4b19.html" title="Star City (comics)">Star City</a> that he was framed for. He teamed up with <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Arrow_bfe4.html" title="Green Arrow">Green Arrow</a> to hunt down the bank robbers responsible, saying that though he did not care what others thought of him, he would fight for his name, asking, "What else do I have?"<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>

<p>Since his original debut, Anarky has been described as a <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superhero.html#Types_of_superheroes" title="Superhero">gadgeteer</a>. In early incarnations, he was portrayed as inexperienced, lacking in many skills, surviving only by his ingenuity. In accordance with this, he would often quote the maxim, "the essence of anarchy is surprise."<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[36]</a></sup> Later, during the two <i>Anarky</i> series, his abilities were increased, and he was described as having enormous talents in both engineering and computer technology, as well as developing skills in martial arts. This was hinted at in several comics published just before the <i>Anarky</i> mini-series, and later elaborated upon within the series itself. According to character dialogue, Anarky's lack of <i><a href="../../../s/u/p/Superhuman.html" title="Superhuman">super-powers</a></i>, and the urgency with which he views his cause, has necessitated that he increase his abilities drastically over the years.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>

<p>Throughout Alan Grant's series of books written for the character, cunning and intelligence were viewed as his primary tools for victory, often using quick thinking, fighting skills, and technology in conjunction with each other in order to defeat tougher opponents. On one occasion he defeated Batman in combat by confusing the hero with <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holography.html" title="Holography">holographic projections</a> long enough to attack and subdue him.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[38]</a></sup> On another occasion he avoided a gang of villains too dangerous to fight, choosing instead to use a flare gun to anonymously signal for Batman to come, and then pitting the two groups against each other.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[39]</a></sup> When in need of back up for intelligence gathering, or a diversion, he would call on the help of the homeless community in Gotham, who had supported him since his first appearance, even going so far as to assault Batman to allow Anarky to get away during their first confrontation.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[40]</a></sup></p>

<p>Following superhero conventions of following a recognizable theme, the character's tools often incorporate the <i><a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchist_symbolism.html#Circle-A" title="Anarchist symbolism">Circle-A</a></i> into them: the symbol of anarchy is often drawn on the spherical bombs, his throwing stars take the shape of the <i>Circle-A</i>, and the flare guns occasionally leave <i>Circle-A</i> smoke trails behind. In his earliest incarnations, he would also use red <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerosol_paint.html" title="Aerosol paint">spray-paint</a> to leave the <i>Circle-A</i> as his calling card,<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[49]</a></sup> much in the same way that <a href="../../../v/_/%28/V_%28comics%29.html" title="V (comics)">V</a> would leave a "<i>Circle-V</i>" symbol.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[50]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1995, Anarky was described as having began to train in martial arts, following the character's time in juvenile hall. By 1997, Alan Grant had increased this ability, describing the character as having progressed remarkably, and to have studied multiple styles, including <a href="../../../a/i/k/Aikido.html" title="Aikido">Aikido</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karate.html" title="Karate">Karate</a>, <a href="../../../j/u/j/Jujutsu.html" title="Jujutsu">Jujutsu</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_martial_arts.html" title="Chinese martial arts">Kung Fu</a>, which the character described as "all integrated by my mind into one smooth fighting style!"<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[51]</a></sup> Following previous modes of behavior, he studied all possible fighting arts, but failed to specialize in any. This largely helped him defend himself against most untrained criminals, but was later described as a decisive weakness whenever he fought opponents who were masters of a particular style.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[52]</a></sup></p>
<p>As a wanted criminal, Anarky's methods and goals were described as leaving him with little logistical support amongst the heroic community, or the public at large, relegating him to underground operation. In his earliest incarnations, he was described as having developed skills as a "<a href="../../../g/r/e/Grey_hat.html" title="Grey hat">grey hat</a>" computer <a href="../../../h/a/c/Hacker.html" title="Hacker">hacker</a> to steal enormous sums of money from various corporations,<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[53]</a></sup>. This skill was quickly adapted by 1992 to allow the character to gain information on other heroes and villains from police computer networks.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[54]</a></sup> By 1997, the skill was further increased to allow him to tap into <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batcave.html" title="Batcave">Batman's supercomputer</a>,<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[55]</a></sup> and the <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_League_Watchtower_94c5.html" title="Justice League Watchtower">Justice League Watchtower</a>.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[56]</a></sup> At this time, the tone of the character began to move away from improvised munitions, and toward self-sufficient funding for more elaborate technology. By 1996 he was described as using the Internet to earn money through his online bookstore, <i>Anarco</i>, which he used as a <a href="../../../f/r/o/Front_organization.html" title="Front organization">front company</a> to propagate his philosophy, and to communicate emergency messages to the general public warning of impending disaster.<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[57]</a></sup> A second, lesser used, front organization, <i>The Anarkist Foundation</i>, was also developed to offer grants to radical causes he supports.<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[58]</a></sup> In one issue of the <i>Anarky</i> series, a brief scene is shown in which Lonnie Machin uses the Internet to hold an <a href="../../../i/n/s/Instant_messaging.html" title="Instant messaging">instant messaging session</a> with the public in which he debated the need for war, arguing that money and time used on the military research would be better spent on agriculture to solve the global <a href="../../../o/v/e/Overpopulation.html" title="Overpopulation">overpopulation</a> crisis.<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[59]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1996 Grant used a <i>Biofeedback Learning Enhancer</i> as a plot device to increase Lonnie's abilities. The device was described as being capable of increasing Anarky's brain functions by a multiple of ten.<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[60]</a></sup> With this enhanced intelligence, and the increased financial independence described above, Anarky went on to create an on-board <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artificial_intelligence.html" title="Artificial intelligence">AI computer</a>, <b>MAX</b> (<i><b>M</b>ulti-<b>A</b>ugmented <b>X</b>-Program</i>);<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[61]</a></sup> a crude but fully functioning <i><a href="../../../b/o/o/Boom_Tube_48d0.html" title="Boom Tube">Boom Tube</a></i>, cobbled together from mathematical analysis and "hard lab work";<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[62]</a></sup>; scratch-built a Justice League <i>Teleport Pad</i>;<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[63]</a></sup>; excavated an underground base with his <i>Boom Tube</i>, hidden below the <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Monument_ef56.html" title="Washington Monument">Washington Monument</a>;<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[64]</a></sup> and briefly commanded his own <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Lantern_12db.html" title="Green Lantern">Green Lantern</a> <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_ring_%28weapon%29.html" title="Power ring (weapon)">power ring</a>.<sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[65]</a></sup> Believing that "science is magic explained," he has also used scientific analysis to explain and manipulate esoteric forces of magic, such as the demon Blasphemy,<sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[66]</a></sup> the power of <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darkseid.html" title="Darkseid">Darkseid</a>,<sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#_note-66" title="">[67]</a></sup> and the spirit of <a href="../../../e/c/l/Eclipso.html" title="Eclipso">Eclipso</a>.<sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[68]</a></sup></p>
<p>This move was later criticized by reviewers, who saw it as having overpowered the character, preventing the suspension of disbelief that was previously possible for a character still described as in his mid-teens. It was further speculated to be a contributing factor for the failure of the second <i>Anarky</i> series.<sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[69]</a></sup></p>

Anarky, now portrayed as in his mid-twenties and sympathizing with the fallen hero, breaks in to the jail in an attempt to rescue Batman mere hours before the execution is to take place, using a <i>Field Disrupter</i> to mask his presence.

<p>Anarky appeared in the <a href="../../../d/c/a/DCAU_ad6c.html" title="DCAU">DC Animated Universe</a> in 1995, in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Batman_Adventures_f8fd.html" title="The Batman Adventures">The Batman Adventures</a></i> #31, <i>"The People's Court"</i>.<sup id="_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#_note-72" title="">[73]</a></sup> Anarky begins holding wealthy business elites hostage and places them on public trial, broadcast from a pirate TV show. He charges his victims with such crimes as the creation of <a href="../../../l/a/n/Land_mine.html" title="Land mine">land mines</a> that kill or cripple thousands, funding <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_World_e346.html" title="Third World">Third World</a> dictators, polluting the air with toxic chemicals, and profiting from <a href="../../../w/a/g/Wage_slavery.html" title="Wage slavery">wage slavery</a>. He also captures <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman.html" title="Batman">Bruce Wayne</a>, and while conceding that Wayne has ethical business practices, implicates him for "the company he keeps." At each trial, Anarky gives the "defendants" the opportunity to speak for themselves, and then asks the viewing audience to phone in one-hundred calls if they find them not guilty, which will deactivate bombs set before the men. As the citizens begin to debate the fate of these men amongst themselves, <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Grayson_3d69.html" title="Dick Grayson">Robin</a> succeeds in tracking down the broadcast. However, when he fails to prevent the explosions from taking place, it is revealed that the bombs are fake, and the public trials were only intended to expose the men and raise public awareness. Anarky is ultimately apprehended, but Robin is left questioning if he wasn't right in his charges against the businessmen. As of 2007, this story features the only encounter between any version of Anarky and <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Grayson_3d69.html" title="Dick Grayson">Dick Grayson</a>.</p>
<p>Anarky has yet to appear in any DCAU animated series.</p>
