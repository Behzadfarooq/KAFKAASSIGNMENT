<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchist_law.html" title="Edit section: Non-Coercion">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Non-Coercion</span></h2>
<p>The most fundamental maxim of anarchism is that no individual has the right to coerce another individual, and that everyone has the right to defend his or her self against coercion. This basic principle forms the basis of all anarchist law, and indeed of virtually all anarchist theory. "It is best summed up by the maxim 'do unto others as you would have them do unto you" (quoting Kropotkin, quoting Jesus), with the additional provision that if others try to do things to you that violate your rights you have the right to stop them. In short, anarchist philosophy includes the 'golden rule', but does not include "turning the other cheek."</p>
<p><a name="Consensus-based_Social_Contracts" id="Consensus-based_Social_Contracts"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchist_law.html" title="Edit section: Consensus-based Social Contracts">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Consensus-based Social Contracts</span></h2>
<p>Since the principle of non-coercion makes hierarchical State structures unfeasible, anarchist communities must find an alternative basis for setting the rules of engagement within a collectivity. Accordingly, virtually all anarchist legal models begin with the assumption that whatever rules are set in place must be freely agreed to by the entirety of the community that is to be governed by them in a setting free from coercion or intimidation. Such freely given consent constitutes a <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_contract.html" title="Social contract">social contract</a>, though the exact nature of such contracts is a matter of heated debate.</p>
<p><a name="Free_Association" id="Free_Association"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchist_law.html" title="Edit section: Free Association">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Free Association</span></h2>
<p>Within an anarchist framework all individuals have the right to freely associate (or not associate) with whomever they choose, and so any attempt to limit that freedom via a social contract would be problematic. Free association also implies the right of individuals to form those exact social contracts, while the freedom to not associate means that if the terms of a social contract become unacceptable to individual members or to some sub-group within a larger collective then the discontented have the right to secede from the contract and form new associations with others that more closely fit their needs.</p>
<p><a name="Mutual_Aid" id="Mutual_Aid"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchist_law.html" title="Edit section: Mutual Aid">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mutual Aid</span></h2>
<p>The principle of Mutual aid, originally identified by Kropotkin as arising from natural law, is that since evolution occurs in groups - not individuals - it is evolutionarily advantageous for members of a community to assist each other. The anarchist approach to building power - and structuring power relationships - is derived from this evolutionary and biological imperative. In a nutshell the argument is that since individuals require the assistance of groups to self-actualize individuals have a strong self-interest in the good of the community to which they belong. It follows that (freely associating) collectives of individuals working for mutual improvement and mutual goals must form the basis of any anarchist society, thus providing the sociological and economic imperative for the creation of social contracts capable of binding these self-selecting groups together.</p>
<p>In a pre-revolutionary situation, the principle of 'mutual aid' is the moral imperative that drives efforts by contemporary anarchists to provide material aid to victims of natural disasters<sup id="_ref-fnb_katrina_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fnb_katrina" title="">[3]</a></sup>, homeless and poor people, and others who have been left without access to food, water, and other basic necessities. The concept is thus derived from scientific research but carries with it a moral imperative.</p>
<p><a name="Enforceability" id="Enforceability"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchist_law.html" title="Edit section: Enforceability">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Enforceability</span></h2>
<p>This is one of the most controversial areas of Anarchist law. Early writers such as Proudhon argues that it was legitimate for working-class people to self-organize against criminals who prey on the weak, a process which would doubtless entail some degree of coercion. Proudhonian mutualists (and many others) have argued that such use of force by a collective against individuals is justifiable since it is fundamentally defensive in nature. As a more coherent example, communities have a clear interest in tracking down and isolating rapists, psychopaths, and others who regularly employ coercion against their victims. The right of ordinary people to not be victimized and coerced by such individuals legitimizes their use of coercive force to eliminate such threats.</p>
<p>It must be noted that some modern "individualist" anarchists (who argue that any collective action against an individual is illegitimate) hotly dispute this point, but at the local level the point is largely moot since it doesn't really matter whether the mother who shoots and kills a child molester is acting on behalf of herself as an individual or on behalf of a community, the child molester is dead and the threat to the community’s children removed in any case.</p>
<p>The issue of mandate (on whose behalf an action is being carried out) is much more significant, however, when approaching larger-scale provisions for self defense such as armies and militias For individualist anarchists the right of individuals to not be coerced legitimizes the use of coercive violence for personal self-defense only, while for collectivists it is legitimized both for personal self-defense and for defense of ones community. This issue is critical since, while the individualist model makes warfare far less likely by eliminating the rational for the creation of large bodies of armed men, the collectivist approach makes it much more likely that the community in question will be able to defend itself against a hostile invader should one appear. Both schools, however, agree that the right and responsibility of self-defense cannot be delegated to a third party - such as a professional police department or standing army - since as soon as a third party becomes involved it is not longer <strong>self</strong> defense. A non-hierarchal militia composed of members of a community self-organizing for mutual self-defense against a hostile neighbor (such as that organized by the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederaci%C3%B3n_Nacional_del_Trabajo_b9fe.html" title="Confederación Nacional del Trabajo">CNT</a> during the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Civil_War_7a30.html" title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a>) would thus be valid in a collectivist (anarchist-communist, social anarchist, anarcho-syndicalist, market-syndicalist, etc) setting and invalid in an individualist (anarchocapitalist, egoist, etc) setting. Both, by contrast, would reject a standing army or police department.</p>
