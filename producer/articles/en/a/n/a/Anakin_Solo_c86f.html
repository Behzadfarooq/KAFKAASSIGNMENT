<p>When Anakin was mere months old, the resurrected <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palpatine.html" title="Palpatine">Emperor Palpatine</a> touched the unborn Anakin Solo through Leia's womb, in a failed attempt to steal the infant's body for himself (he was permanently destroyed moments later). Originally, Han wanted his name to be Han Solo Jr., but his mother decided to name him after his grandfather.</p>
<p>Anakin was born on Nespis VIII about a year and a half after his siblings, Jaina and Jacen<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. Like his grandfather, <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anakin_Skywalker_c92f.html" title="Anakin Skywalker">Anakin Skywalker</a>, he was incredibly strong in the Force, especially for a child so young. However, Anakin felt that he had inherited not only his grandfather's name, but also his dark legacy as the <a href="../../../s/i/t/Sith_Lord_7350.html" title="Sith Lord">Sith Lord</a> <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darth_Vader_35c8.html" title="Darth Vader">Darth Vader</a>. As a child he often had nightmares of Vader and a very strong fear of the dark side. By the time he was three, Anakin's gifts had become obvious to his uncle, <a href="../../../l/u/k/Luke_Skywalker_d1fc.html" title="Luke Skywalker">Luke Skywalker</a>. By the time he was seven, he had demonstrated a remarkable ability to make anything mechanical work, regardless of whether he understood the device's purpose or its components.</p>
<p>In 14 <a href="../../../a/b/y/ABY_197c.html" title="ABY">ABY</a> during the Empire Reborn movement, the Imperial Procurator of Justice, Lord Hethrir, kidnapped the Solo children to use in his plot for their Force powers. There, Anakin developed a relationship with Tigris, the son of <a href="../../../h/e/t/Hethrir.html" title="Hethrir">Hethrir</a> and his mate Rillao, who served as Anakin's guard (and Hethrir's servant). In exchange for Waru's help, Hethrir tried to sacrifice Anakin to Waru, but Luke, Han and Leia Solo battled Hethrir and Waru and rescued Anakin and siblings. Waru, giving up the hope that Hethrir would help him go back to his own <a href="../../../d/i/m/Dimension.html" title="Dimension">dimension</a>, destroyed Hethrir.</p>
<p>Anakin figured prominently in the discovery and activation of some of the ancient Corellian planetary repulsors during the reign of <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrackan_Sal-Solo_9614.html" title="Thrackan Sal-Solo">Thrackan Sal-Solo</a> on Corellia in 18 ABY.</p>
<p>He continued to show great aptitude with not only the Force, but in mathematics and engineering and when his siblings returned from their initial studies on <a href="../../../y/a/v/Yavin_4.html" title="Yavin 4">Yavin IV</a>, Anakin was allowed to go to start his <a href="../../../j/e/d/Jedi.html" title="Jedi">Jedi</a> training.</p>

Anakin, at the age of eleven.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Anakin arrived on <a href="../../../y/a/v/Yavin_4.html" title="Yavin 4">Yavin 4</a> at the age of eleven. He then immediately befriended <a href="../../../t/a/h/Tahiri_Veila_960e.html" title="Tahiri Veila">Tahiri Veila</a>, a girl two years his junior who was recently discovered by <a href="../../../l/u/k/Luke_Skywalker_d1fc.html" title="Luke Skywalker">Luke Skywalker</a> on his home planet of <a href="../../../t/a/t/Tatooine.html" title="Tatooine">Tatooine</a>. Together, they discovered the Golden Globe beneath the Palace of the Woolamander and the existence of the ancient Jedi Master <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Ancient_Jedi_baa9.html#Ikrit" title="List of Ancient Jedi">Ikrit</a>, who had told them that the thousands of souls were imprisoned within could only be released by Force-sensitive children.</p>
<p>After that, Anakin and Tahiri traveled to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Wars_planets_%28W-Z%29_ab59.html#Yavin" title="List of Star Wars planets (W-Z)">Yavin VIII</a> at the request of their Melodie friend, Lyric. There, they accompanied her whilst she went through the Changing Ceremony, in which Lyric would change forms. Anakin fought and killed their ambushers, which included an avril, a reel, several raiths and a purella. During this, the duo found a matching ancient carving on the wall of a cave that informed them that in 3,997 <a href="../../../b/b/y/BBY_f47a.html" title="BBY">BBY</a>, Lord <a href="../../../e/x/a/Exar_Kun_a187.html" title="Exar Kun">Exar Kun</a> trapped countless number of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Wars_races_%28K-O%29_e9f9.html#Massassi" title="List of Star Wars races (K-O)">Massassi</a> children with his Sith magic. It also said that the magic could be penetrated by Force-sensitive children.</p>
<p>Tahiri's foster father, Sliven, the leader of the <a href="../../../t/u/s/Tusken_Raider_5ece.html" title="Tusken Raider">Tusken clan</a>, demanded that she return to <a href="../../../t/a/t/Tatooine.html" title="Tatooine">Tatooine</a>, where she would decide her fate after six months of her stay at the Academy: whether she would train as a Jedi or return to her tribe. There, Sliven told Tahiri of her true heritage. Her parents were Force-sensitive moisture farmers named Tryst and Cassa Veila, who were accidentally killed by the Tribe, who went looking for the missing Sliven. In reality, he was in care of her parents and after they were killed, Sliven took Tahiri under his wing, who had to strike a deal with the Tribe so that she could stay. When Tahiri was of age, she would undergo a test to prove herself and Sliven as a leader. Anakin came along with Tahiri during her test, which also turned out to test their Force abilities—surviving the harshest <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desert.html" title="Desert">deserts</a> of the Dune Sea and battling a Krayt dragon. The duo returned to Yavin IV and freed the souls.</p>
<p>Later, Anakin was plagued by dreams of the Emperor and Darth Vader telling him that he was destined to become a <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_Jedi_f456.html" title="Dark Jedi">Dark Jedi</a>. Worried, Anakin requested that he travel to <a href="../../../d/a/g/Dagobah.html" title="Dagobah">Dagobah</a> and face himself in the same cave Luke Skywalker had done so years ago. He was accompanied by Tahiri and Ikrit—and to their surprise, a stowaway named Uldir Lochett, who thought himself to have Force potential, but really only had a vague, feathery instinct that sensed when the Force was being used. The four faced swamp creatures and both Tahiri and Anakin went inside the cave separately. While Anakin emerged victorious, Tahiri saw images of her past, including her grandfather, who had once been a <a href="../../../j/e/d/Jedi.html" title="Jedi">Jedi Knight</a> murdered during <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palpatine.html" title="Palpatine">Palpatine</a>'s <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Jedi_Purge_3796.html" title="Great Jedi Purge">Great Jedi Purge</a>, and her parents.</p>

<p>Back at Yavin IV, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_New_Order_Jedi_characters_5455.html#Solusar.2C_Tionne" title="List of New Order Jedi characters">Tionne Solusar</a>, the Jedi historian, found that <a href="../../../o/b/i/Obi-Wan_Kenobi_fb34.html" title="Obi-Wan Kenobi">Obi-Wan Kenobi</a>'s lightsaber was saved by Darth Vader. With Anakin, Tahiri, Uldir and Ikrit, Tionne went to Vader's fortress at Bast Castle on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Wars_planets_%28T-V%29_b9a6.html#Vjun" title="List of Star Wars planets (T-V)">Vjun</a> to retrieve it, only to have Orloc, a self-claimed "<a href="../../../m/a/g/Magic_%28paranormal%29.html" title="Magic (paranormal)">mage</a>" after it as well. Orloc, after capturing Uldir, manipulated the youth by claiming that he had great powers and therefore would grant him Jedi powers. When his companions rescued him and escaped with the <a href="../../../l/i/g/Lightsaber.html" title="Lightsaber">lightsaber</a> and the Jedi <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocron.html" title="Holocron">Holocron</a>, Uldir stole the artifacts and went back to Orloc.</p>
<p>His companions chased him to Exis Station, in which Orloc had demonostrated his powers to Uldir. In reality, they were only technological tricks that could only be performed in Orloc's base, Exis Station. Uldir, seeing his friends battle Orloc with true Force powers, joined them and defeated the mage. Anakin and his companions returned to the Jedi Praxeum with both artifacts safely in their possession.</p>
<p>Anakin graduated from his Junior Jedi Class and returned to Coruscant, where he attended school, developed his piloting skills, and studied under the careful tutelage of <a href="../../../c/-/3/C-3PO_9833.html" title="C-3PO">C-3PO</a>. Following the attack by the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shadow_Academy_5b2c.html" title="Shadow Academy">Shadow Academy</a> in 23 ABY, he returned to Yavin IV and helped rebuild the Great Temple by viewing its rubble as a huge puzzle to be solved.</p>
<p>During that time, he went through several adventures with his siblings and their friends, including the mission to find Zekk, taking down Black Sun, accompanying his father to Ord Mantell, etc.—and usually was the one with the plans and ideas, which was due to his uncanny ability (and enjoyment) to solve complex problems and puzzles.</p>
<p>When he turned fourteen, Anakin graduated from the Academy and became apprentices along with other students like Jacen, Jaina, <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenel_Ka_5026.html" title="Tenel Ka">Tenel Ka</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_New_Order_Jedi_characters_5455.html#Lowbacca" title="List of New Order Jedi characters">Lowbacca</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_New_Order_Jedi_characters_5455.html#Zekk" title="List of New Order Jedi characters">Zekk</a>. Together with his brother Jacen, Anakin trained directly with Luke, just as Luke began moving the new Jedi Knights back to the pre-Empire format of teaching.</p>

<p>It was when Luke started training both Anakin and Jacen that Anakin grew stronger and became more respected among the Jedi.</p>
<p>Both Jacen and Anakin had different ideas on what the future of the Jedi should be. The two brothers often clashed, claiming their intense lightsaber duels were simply training.</p>
<p>Anakin agreed with Luke, that the formation of a new Jedi Council would help bring the vigilantes under control.

Both brothers had the Living Force, but towards the end of the Yuuzhan Vong War, Jacen had more so to do with the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Force_%28Star_Wars%29_fc7e.html#The_Unifying_Force" title="Force (Star Wars)">Unifying Force</a>, which deals with fulfilling destiny, and less with the Living Force later. Anakin's relationship with the people, as well as his way of acting on instinct and concentrating on the present, caused him to thrive on the Living Force (perhaps a bit too much). His love and compassion for them and his strong and stubborn unwillingness to sacrifice others, spurred even more so by the guilt that he couldn't save the people who'd sacrificed in his stead, was what would cause his death in the future. one-year-old Anakin was at the forefront of the <a href="../../../y/u/u/Yuuzhan_Vong_68ce.html" title="Yuuzhan Vong">Yuuzhan Vong</a> invasion, present at Sernpidal, the first planet lost to the Vong. Anakin was forced to fly the Millennium Falcon and flee. The freighter was taking on as many refugees as possible before Sernpidal's moon could crash into its surface. Anakin kept the Falcon grounded as long as he could, soaring away from the cataclysm at the last possible instant. This decision resulted in the death of Chewbacca, who was unable to board the Falcon in time. The death of the beloved Wookiee forever changed the dynamics of the Solo family. Han blamed Anakin, and it was many months before the two were reconciled. Anakin also blamed himself, and further threw himself into his beliefs despite his brother Jacen's protests. Because of his losses, Anakin pushed himself harder and harder against the invading enemy forces, trying to live up to Chewbacca's sacrifice.</p>
<p>Later on, Anakin doggedly protected a terminally ill <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mara_Jade_a09f.html" title="Mara Jade">Mara Jade Skywalker</a> on <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dantooine.html" title="Dantooine">Dantooine</a>. Soon after this, refugees from Dubrillion, who <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lando_Calrissian_ee89.html" title="Lando Calrissian">Lando Calrissian</a> had evacuated, came on the planet as well. Unfortunately, the Yuuzhan Vong followed them and the Battle of Dantooine had begun. Anakin and Jacen killed <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Legion" class="extiw" title="wikt:Legion">legions</a> of reptiloid Chazrach slave soldiers and beetle-like Thrall herders from the Yuuzhan Vong's own galaxy. However, they found out that the Chazrack were mindless, functioning much like <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_droids.html" title="Battle droids">battle droids</a>. With the Jedi's efforts, including Luke, who had destroyed a thrall herder, the refugees managed to escape Dantooine after the enemies were defeated.</p>
<p>In the same year, after learning through the computer program created by Anakin that kept track of the usage of the data library (to make things easier for the Jedi on their missions) that <a href="../../../d/a/e/Daeshara%27cor.html" title="Daeshara'cor">Daeshara'cor</a> wanted super-weapons for some deadly purpose, Luke, Mara, <a href="../../../m/i/r/Mirax_Terrik_d543.html" title="Mirax Terrik">Mirax Horn</a>, Anakin and a <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grifter.html" title="Grifter">grifter</a> named Chalco traveled to different worlds to stop her. At Garos IV, although Anakin and Chalco were told to stay on the ship, Chalco talked Anakin into leaving the ship to check out local information sources. Anakin ended up being captured, along with Chalco, who had gotten captured in attempts to rescue the teenager. Anakin used the Force to knock Daeshara'cor out with Chalco's blaster while in captivity, and ended up bringing Daeshara'cor to the light side. He, along with the other Jedi, fought at <a href="../../../i/t/h/Ithor.html" title="Ithor">Ithor</a>. At the battle, after seeing Daeshara'cor poisoned by the amphistaff, Anakin defended her from the Yuuzhan Vong, wielding two lightsabers: his and Daeshara'cor's. Even though he, along with help from Luke and Mara, managed to get the Twi'lek to the medical bay, she had died—reassuring him that she would not have changed anything. Despite this, Anakin still blamed himself and sunk deeper into his guilt. The Jedi had to take a proactive stance against the Yuuzhan Vong, Anakin believed, or more and more people would die.</p>
<p>Anakin began developing Jedi tactics that could be used against the Yuuzhan Vong. He rediscovered a lost Force skill, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_Meditation_f53e.html" title="Battle Meditation">Battle Meditation</a>, and refined it into a technique known as <a href="../../../f/o/r/Force_Meld_282e.html" title="Force Meld">Force Meld</a> which was used to coordinate Jedi in battle, namely in spaceflight. He also designed the prototype for the <a href="../../../y/v/h/YVH_1_Droid_6c17.html" title="YVH 1 Droid">Yuuzhan Vong Hunter Droids (YVH)</a> manufactured by <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lando_Calrissian_ee89.html" title="Lando Calrissian">Lando Calrissian</a>.</p>
<p>Word of his accomplishments travelled across the galaxy, and citizens, as well as the younger and even the older, more traditional Jedi, of the New Republic regarded him as a galactic hero, the freshest face of the Jedi Order and somebody who might one day take his uncle's place as the most powerful Jedi.</p>
<p>Archaeologists and engineers at Centerpoint Station had been trying to reactivate the superweapon, but discovered that because the Station had attuned itself to Anakin's fingerprints, brainwaves, and DNA, it wouldn't activate without him. The New Republic hoped to use this massive station to wipe out the Yuuzhan Vong fleet, but Jacen convinced Anakin that using the Station in such a way would be tantamount to turning to the dark side. Frustrated with Anakin's recalcitrance, <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrackan_Sal-Solo_9614.html" title="Thrackan Sal-Solo">Thrackan Sal-Solo</a> fired the weapon himself—and missed, destroying much of the allied Hapan fleet. Knowing that he would have had precise aim had he been at the controls, Anakin blamed both Jacen and himself for the friendly casualties. Later, Anakin proved to be of importance when contributing to the defense of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Wars_planets_%28C-D%29_1590.html#Duro" title="List of Star Wars planets (C-D)">Duro</a> by shooting down a serpentine Ychna that was attacking the city, Orr-Om.</p>

Anakin Solo, Tahiri Veila and Master Ikrit in 26 ABY.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>When the Yuuzhan Vong bore down on Yavin IV and the New Republic refused to send aid in 26 ABY, Anakin impetuously ran off to the system in an attempt to save the students studying there. In the ensuing battle, Anakin's childhood mentor <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Ancient_Jedi_baa9.html#Ikrit" title="List of Ancient Jedi">Master Ikrit</a> was killed and his friend Tahiri captured. Anakin found an unlikely ally in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Yuuzhan_Vong_4f5c.html#Vua_Rapuung" title="List of Yuuzhan Vong">Vua Rapuung</a>, a Yuuzhan Vong outcast, who helped him infiltrate the enemy encampment and rescue Tahiri. Anakin's lightsaber was damaged in the rescue attempt and he had to rebuild it using a Yuuzhan Vong lambent. He attuned his lightsaber to himself and discovered a way to sense the Vong through the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Force_%28Star_Wars%29_fc7e.html" title="Force (Star Wars)">Force</a>. Anakin was the first Jedi after <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_minor_Star_Wars_Jedi_knights_34a7.html#Vergere" title="List of minor Star Wars Jedi knights">Vergere</a> to have sensed the Yuuzhan Vong thus. He called it the "<a href="../../../v/o/n/Vongsense.html" title="Vongsense">Vongsense</a>". This name was later adopted by Jacen Solo.</p>
<p>The Yuuzhan Vong had performed numerous experiments on Tahiri during her captivity. Anakin helped her recover from the ordeal. Meanwhile, rumors of their exploits on Yavin IV ran rampant through the working class "shamed ones" of the Yuuzhan Vong, who soon began to see Jedi as their salvation.</p>
<p>After Anakin helped Tahiri repress her Yuuzhan Vong personality from taking total control, <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corran_Horn_bd1c.html" title="Corran Horn">Corran Horn</a> took the two of them to Eriadu, to get supplies. What started as a simple mission, ended up being complicated after learning from Kelbis Nu, a fellow Rodian Jedi Knight who Anakin and Tahiri set off to rescued after sensing him in trouble, learned from him was that Yag'Dhul, where the Givin lived, was the Vong's next target—because of its handy location between Corellian Trade Spine and and Rinma Trade Route. After being arrested by anti-Jedi Erudian judicials, Tahiri saved Anakin (under her Yuuzhan Vong personality) from further interrogation and escaped. The three of them rode under a Yuuzhan Vong spy ship to warn the Givin. While doing so, they encountered Nom Anor and his warriors, in which Anakin challenged one to a duel and won. To destroy the Yuuzhan Vong, the Givin decided to draw air out of the space sation while Corran, Anakin and Tahiri went in search for vac suits there. After complications, the duo were pushed into an oxygenated, yet leaking locker. Anakin, believing that they were going to die, admitted his love for her and the two shared a kiss. Corran Horn, who had, much to the duo's embarrassment, figured what had happened between them, returned for them and the combined Givin and New Republic fleet defeated the Yuuzhan Vong.</p>
<p>When the Yuuzhan Vong bioengineered Jedi-hunting creatures called <a href="../../../v/o/x/Voxyn.html" title="Voxyn">Voxyn</a>, Lyric was among the first to fall in 27 ABY. Anakin led a strike team into the Myrkr system; its mission was to destroy the cloning facility where the creatures were being bred. But things went wrong from the beginning when Ulaha Kore, one of the strike team tacticians, was gravely injured. Jaina cracked when Ulaha was further subjected to torture. The Yuuzhan Vong torturer decided to pick on her and force her to choose between her younger brother or her twin.</p>
<p>"They're both my brothers," Jaina protested, but Anakin told her to select him as the next victim. The Yuuzhan Vong tortured him, but he didn't react—which earned admiration from his torturers. He bought the strike team enough time to take over the ship they were on, but his decisions were again criticized by Jacen.</p>
<p>During another skirmish aboard the <i>Banu Rass</i>, Anakin impulsively ran to his sister's rescue and was stabbed in the gut. The wound ruptured his spleen. Even as his spleen was leaking away, Anakin refused to drop into a Force trance—his mission objective was more important to him than his own well being. His connection to the Force remained strong, and he gathered energy around him like a magnet. Anakin became a glowing extension of the Force itself and he achieved complete oneness with the Force, a state that was achieved only by Anakin Skywalker, and afterwards, <a href="../../../g/a/n/Ganner_Rhysode_8e91.html" title="Ganner Rhysode">Ganner Rhysode</a> in 28 ABY and Jacen Solo in 30 ABY. Being almost invincible, he cut down Yuuzhan Vong in order to get his friends closer to the voxyn queen. An interesting thing to note is that at that moment, he could sense the Yuuzhan Vong through the Force as well as he could the other Jedi.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>This matter still remains a mystery as to why he could suddenly sense the Yuuzhan Vong with such clarity. A theory is that the Force supernova that consumed his body eventually was able to further Anakin's perception and allow him to see the full spectrum of the Force, including the <i>Vongsense</i>. However, the intense energy quickly consumed him as it escaped through his mortal wound (being mortally wounded meant that Anakin could not sustain and keep the Force energy within him as it consumed a vessel too weakened to hold it), and Anakin died shortly after ensuring that Tahiri was safe. Anakin gave his life destroying the voxyn cloning samples. His death was transmitted through the Force, and his family and fellow Jedi Knights were devastated by it. However, because of his death, even the enemy came to admire him.</p>
<p>His death forced Jacen into a leadership position, pushed his sister Jaina to the dark side, and launched Tahiri into the throes of despair. His sister rashly attacked a Yuuzhan Vong mortuary and recovered his body. She flew his body to Hapes, where the entire family gathered for a funeral. After a memorial ceremony, the fallen hero was cremated by Luke Skywalker.</p>
<p>Anakin's lightsaber was to have a bigger role in determining the fate of the Yuuzhan Vong. Nom Anor gave it to Jacen, in hopes that he could convert him to their religion, which failed. Ganner Rhysode, who'd come to rescue him, died after killing many Yuuzhan Vong with Anakin's lightsaber. The last time his lightsaber would be used was during the duel between <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Yuuzhan_Vong_4f5c.html#Shimrra_Jamaane" title="List of Yuuzhan Vong">Supreme Overlord Shimrra Jamaane</a> and Luke in the Battle of Coruscant; starting out in the hands of Shimrra and ending with Luke, who cut off the Overlord's head. When the war ended, Han Solo, as a way of tribute, placed the lightsaber in the tree stump, in front of a carving of <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chewbacca.html" title="Chewbacca">Chewbacca</a> on <a href="../../../k/a/s/Kashyyyk.html" title="Kashyyyk">Kashyyyk</a> like a 'sword in the stone'.</p>
<p>During the Second Corellian Insurrection, the Galactic Alliance Guard deployed a <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Destroyer_09b7.html#Galactic_Alliance_Star_Destroyers" title="Star Destroyer">Star Destroyer</a> named <i>Anakin Solo</i>, much to his parent's disdain.</p>

Anakin as a spirit.</div>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Many a prophecy about Anakin has gone unfulfilled because of his death, including Luke's vision of Anakin and his siblings leading the Jedi Order in <i>Dark Empire II</i>. Jedi Master Ikrit also prophesied that there would be something great born in Anakin and Tahiri, which seems to have been abruptly cut short, too.</li>
<li>Anakin's death replaced the scheduled death of Jacen in <i>Star by Star</i>, the reasoning is that two Anakins active in different times would be a source of confusion to fans. Several fans found this premise insulting.</li>
<li>Theories abound, arguing that Anakin is still alive. But since a body universally identified as Anakin's was burned and his death was felt through the Force, it's highly unlikely that he is alive in the conventional sense of the word. Although Jacen did catch three glimpses of Anakin's ghost while prisoner on Coruscant, fans point out that Jacen was cut off from the Force and nearing a mental breakdown at the time, Anakin died at a cloning facility (so there would be a possibility that his body was cloned) and that Tahiri still has nightmares about him. Also, some fans theorize that the "Slayers", genetically modified, shorter-than-average Yuuzhan Vong warriors encountered during the Battle of Coruscant are clones of Anakin or otherwise share some of his genetic material.</li>
<li>A boy named Tarc (originally Daq Hantaq), whose face was modified by corrupt senator <a href="../../../v/i/q/Viqi_Shesh_47df.html" title="Viqi Shesh">Viqi Shesh</a> to look like young Anakin. He will presumably grow out of the plastic surgery, and currently travels with famous documentarian Wolam Tser.</li>
<li>Lucasarts has confirmed that a version of Anakin — either Solo or Skywalker — will appear in the forthcoming <i><a href="../../../l/e/g/Legacy_of_the_Force_38fe.html" title="Legacy of the Force">Legacy of the Force</a></i> series. It has not been confirmed if this will be as a Force ghost, clone, or some other iteration. <a href="../../../b/e/t/Legacy_of_the_Force%7E_Betrayal_8d5a.html" title="Legacy of the Force: Betrayal">Legacy of the Force: Betrayal</a> featured a droid designed by the <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corellia.html" title="Corellia">Corellians</a> who believed itself to be Anakin Solo. This droid possessed the deceased Jedi's memories and personality, although Ben Skywalker (Luke and Mara's son) convinced it that it was merely an artificial construct that Thrackan-Sal Solo planned to use in order to trick Centerpoint station into firing (the space station would only respond to the thought patterns and fingerprints of Anakin Solo). It is unknown whether this is the sole "version" of Anakin Solo that will appear in the series.</li>
