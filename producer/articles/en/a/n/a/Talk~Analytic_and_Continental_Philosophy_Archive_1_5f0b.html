<h2><span class="mw-headline">Proposals to ammend</span></h2>
<p>This article is mostly incorrect and describes some popular sentiment amongst a rather uninformed group of intellectuals (although I'm hesitant to give them this generous title). The distinction put forward is a lovely grown prejudice, making it easy (and excusing) to settle down in some intellectual camp disregarding the rest. Although there are differences in style and way of thinking, say, between phenomenology, analytic philosophy and critical theory (nobody would deny that), there is hardly a basis to read two different traditions one being continental the other being analytic. It is rather a distinction used by (certainly not only in the United States) philosophers of weak intellect to justify their ignorance or dismissal of all the arguments, he or she ought to consider. Therefore this article is (as it stands) nothing more but some emotional excuse and not an encyclopaedic entry.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<p>"On the other hand, most in the Analytic tradition care first and foremost about theses and the reasons for and against accepting them."</p>
<p>Such a senseless phrase can only be countered by irony: As if philosophers of Critical Theory, Historism, Neo-Kantianism or an ontological view would not care about arguments and reasons. It seems as though they not even care about reason. And, in general, why not just write that "all of these continentals" just write poetry. That would be at least honest concerning the reader of this article. The continental philosophers being a bunch of café house talking old men reciting their poems. Oh yeah, I forgot, that that is already mentioned:</p>
<p>In continental philosophy it is more common to reference a writer's literature, novels and poetry, or real-life examples from cafes, work, etc. [there is a period too much]</p>
<p>I wonder if anyone (of these (analytic) people) has ever read Kant, Hermann Cohen, Hermann von Helmholtz, Nicolai Hartmann or Günther Jacoby? If they wrote café house poems, analytic philosophy is grade school child talk. It seems to me that some reference to Nietzsche and Sartre are justification enough to live a happy life in ignorance.</p>
<p>And by the way, why the heck was the predominant philosophical school in Germany throughout the first half of the 20th century (up to WWII) logical positivism? A good deal, if not as much as a third, of analytic philosophy was developed in German speaking countries.</p>
<p>Before undulating more and refuting other passages in more detail, I want to safe my time and be not only destructive but also constructive.</p>
<p>Nobody denies that some people think that there is a difference between an analytic way of philosophy and a continental one. The article should not present the issue as if there really is such a split. Or it really has to underpin substantially this division by showing detailed evidence, not being only a quote by Sartre or Derrida! (This division is conceptualised as being universal)</p>
<p>It therefore seems to me that the article should begin: "'Some think' that these are the two main kinds of philosophy currently taught in academic philosophy." The article should continue by having a "some think" before every believed difference is stated. It needs to be rewritten so it becomes clear, that this division is ONLY a subjective judgment of some philosophers or other people. I do not say that this view isn't spread out but it is unjustified and just a coward rebuttal. If anyone wants to draw this distinction he or she has to argue in more detail and with robust evidence, otherwise this article is a joke and I would not spend so much time criticising it, if not some undergraduate student or high school student could read it and might believe it! So take it as a constructive criticism and for all readers as a WARNING that this division is mostly not existent (although certainly there are some differences). Very kind regards Jörg Frohberg. 204.52.215.15 12:34, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not sure what to say about this long rant and opinion, but it seems the "editor" wants finally wants to contribute by scattering the phrase, "some think" in front of many sentences in the article. I direct you to the opening paragraphs of the article</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>which indicate that this division is already contested by some. Have a look too at existing related pages which also indicate what these names, Analytic and Continental mean in the 20th Century, they indicate a division. To ignore this division, just talk about philosophy in general.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Feel free to add a note about Logical Positivism, even though this was mainly a scientific movement with some failed attempt at philosophical grounding.</dd>
<dd>As to the issue about "theses and arguments" you take the phrase</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>out of context, it is really an attempt to contrast it with continental's more philosopher centred and historically centred approach as opposed to a more bare thesis/statement style.</p>

<p>While I do not agree with all of the specific arguments in discussion above, I agree that this article is badly written, POV and to some extent inaccurate. Unless there are any objections, I intend to scrap large parts of it and replace it with something better as soon as I find time - <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalthrow_26cd.html" title="User:Palthrow">Palthrow</a> 20:37, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well I dont think that is a good idea, you should agree here on the talk page before making any major changes. The first, "bunch of intellectuals", poster above wishes to deny the division, this is mentioned in the article too. He sees the creation of a division as an excuse to ignore on another, perhaps a valid comment to add to the article, but can we deny the division, even if it is such an excuse? This issue is not simple and I doubt anyone has easy answer. I believe almost all the comments above are covered in the article but many made are just not applicable eg, that it is not a strictly geographic division (already mentined), nor that certain crossovers have occurrred (ditto).</p>
<p>No doubt it needs work and certain things remain out of it and additions might be helpful, for example, to mention Rorty's idea upon "conversational" philosophy. POV is in some way unavaoidable since the idea of the article is to get both POVs, that is, Continental and Analytic POV, the reason, perhaps, why there is the division in the first place, is that there is no easy neutral ground from which to write the article. --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">Lucas</a></p>

<dd>-- Thanks for directing my attention here, Lucas. The first poster is right overall - the article is shockingly bad and misleading. It is fair to say that the idea of such a split has been a lively issue in Western academic philosophy departments since some time in the early twentieth century. Defining the split is, however, much harder. It is, in large part, stylistic, so apportioning content to one side or the other is disastrous:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>1. World/Thought. It is not true that analytic philosophers segment the subject, while continental philosophers do not. (And what does the heading mean?)</p>
<p>2. Text/Issue. Wildly misleading to the uninformed reader, as analytic philosophy has been in large part the philosophy of language. Also, analytic philosophers have written copiously on historic philosophers and their texts. Similarly, there are continental philosophers who write about topics with little citation of other thinkers.</p>
<p>3. Examples. Again, not a clear divide. Both sides use both types of example.</p>
<p>4. Yes, there is much more use of traditional formal logic in the analytic school, but this is a weak foundation for the distinction.</p>
<p>5. Descriptive/Critical. That's largely fair.</p>
<p>Getting to the substance, one recent book which it would help to consult and cite is Michael Dummett's Origins of Analytic Philosophy. Analytic philosophy had two origins: the rejection by Moore and Russell of the Hegelianism which had become dominant in British philosophies through the teaching of McTaggart and Bradley, and - separately - the schism between Frege and Husserl over psychologism. These were twentieth century, not nineteenth century, developments. ("sublation and speculative/concrete thought" - why "sublation" particularly, and Hegel's thought IS speculative, not "concrete"...???). Not to mention, "Hegel's ideas about history altering what is considered as "true" - someone here doesn't know any Hegel.</p>
<p>Of course Russell and Husserl were trained in philosophy.</p>
<p>Logical Positivism does need to be mentioned. It was a philosophical, not a scientific movement, it was based in Austria, and it's very existence makes the so-called distinction look as clumsy as it is.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Is this a valid topic at all?</span></h2>
<p>There is a radical assymetry between analytic and "continental" philosophy, which makes me wonder whether this entire article shouldn't be reduced to a comment in an entry on Analytic philosophy. Analytic philosophy is a recognized school, with documented roots, and analytic philosophers call themselves just that: "analytic philosophers". On the other hand, there is NO SUCH SCHOOL as continental philosophy. I am not aware that any philosopher has ever described him or herself as a "continental philosopher" or described their philosophical work as "continental". In fact, "continental" philosophy is the term which has been used, largely but note entirely perjoratively, by analytic philosophers to signify the (actually very disparate) philosophical factions, mainly based in Europe, who are doing something other than analytical philosophy. So: a name of an actual, self-acknowledged school, and a vague, somewhat derogatory, term USED BY members of that school. That's the reality, and that's why it's a bad topic for the article.
