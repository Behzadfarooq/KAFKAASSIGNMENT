<dd><b>prolly not</b> - Individualist anarchism (by which I mean <i>Benjamin-Tucker-ism</i>) is considered "anarchist" by movement anarchists apparently because it derives in large part from Proudhon, which is not really true of ancaps.

<dd><i>strawman</i> The claim wasn't that they were not against capitalism, but rather that they didn't define capitalism as contrary to anarchism. However, when viewing all the evidence from their texts, rather than selective portions, it is apparent that they did believe capitalism to be incompatible with anarchism. It is likely that they did not say so explicitly because no one at the time claimed otherwise. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 6 July 2005 05:09 (UTC)</dd>

<h4><span class="mw-headline">Notes</span></h4>
<p><cite id="fn_anti_ac_1"><a href="#fn_anti_ac_1_back" title="">Note anti_ac_1</a>:</cite> This is a case of people being stuck in the past and wanting to keep everybody else there. Of course, anarcho-capitalism, is incompatible with "traditional anarchism." But, so what? This article is called "Anarchism," not "Traditional Anarchism." <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a></p>
<p><cite id="fn_anti_ac_2"><a href="#fn_anti_ac_2_back" title="">Note anti_ac_2</a>:</cite> By the same logic one could say that a flower is defined as a plant, but it isn't defined as growing in dirt and requiring water, so those things aren't necessary. From a basic definition you draw obvious conclusions. Anarchism is against hierarchy, therefore it will be against, for example, sexism. Capitalism is yet another obvious thing that anarchism is against. <a href="../../../f/a/t/User%7EFatal_5ada.html" title="User:Fatal">Fatal</a></p>
<p><cite id="fn_anti_ac_3"><a href="#fn_anti_ac_3_back" title="">Note anti_ac_3</a>:</cite> You think all anarchism is collectivist anarchism. Traditional individualist anarchism does not oppose voluntary boss and employee relationships as long as they stick to the labor theory of value. Involuntary hierarchy is opposed, of course, but not hierarchy in itself unless you're a collectivist anarchist. Maybe you don't think traditional individualist anarchism is real anarchism? If so, you're wrong. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a></p>
<p><cite id="fn_anti_ac_4"><a href="#fn_anti_ac_4_back" title="">Note anti_ac_4</a>:</cite> I don't know the exact numbers involved, but the libertarian movement is large and significant, with many publications and organizations (though, as others have noted, they're less prone to rioting in the streets and smashing things, which makes them less-often in the news; however, the local newscast in my area yesterday specifically mentioned the Libertarian Party as the instigator of a successful move to get the county to repeal its ban on Sunday liquor sales). Within the libertarian movement, there are more minarchists than anarcho-capitalists, but anarcho-capitalism (often referred to within the libertarian movement as simply "anarchism", since that term has the meaning of "anti-government" with no socialist baggage in these circles) is widely recognized as the most pure and extreme form of libertarianism even if most libertarians decline to go that far themselves. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan*</a></p>
<p><cite id="fn_anti_ac_5"><a href="#fn_anti_ac_5_back" title="">Note anti_ac_5</a>:</cite> Actually all schools of anarchism are compatible with each other in the broad sense, all major things are the same, like the abolition of hierarchy. And if you're one of these people that likes to use the word government because you think that excludes other hierarchy, i've got news for you, they're synonyms. --<a href="../../../f/a/t/User%7EFatal_5ada.html" title="User:Fatal">Fatal</a> 01:19, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><cite id="fn_anti_ac_6"><a href="#fn_anti_ac_6_back" title="">Note anti_ac_6</a>:</cite> Again, as I pointed out above, traditioanl individualist anarchists do not oppose hierarchy as long as it's voluntary. All anarchism is not collectivism. That, together with the individualists' advocacy of private property rights and a market economy pit them squarely against the collectivist anarchists and they say so themselves. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 02:30, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

All those individuals can expound on these supposed precursors on their own pages, the general page can be left to those precursors which apply to all of anarchism, so unless there is objection we all get Lao Tzu, Godwin, etc).

<dd>Harris, the NDP has absolutely nothing to do with the a/c page. It has to do with the general Anarchism article only. The NDP would point to two articles - one about Anarchism using the broad (anti-state) definition, the other with the narrow (anti-state + socialist) definition - and let the Wiki user decide which meaning to choose. Then, instead of having a permanent edit war, we'd have at most the occasional vandalism of <i>the other faction's</i> article. It solves the problem by giving each faction their own playpen. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 05:01, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>As it stands now, almost all unqualified uses of the word "anarchism" in wikipedia refers to socialist/collectivist anarchism— even Individualist Anarchism is generally qualified.</li>
<li>If we accept the default unqualified term "anarchism" to refer to a philosophy that is anti-state <b>and</b> anti-capitalist, Ancaps aren't "anarchists" by this usage.</li>
<li>If an <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-capitalist.html" title="Anti-capitalist">anti-capitalist</a> article exists, it follows that an <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-statism.html" title="Anti-statism">anti-statism</a> article should as well, since the two philosophies aren't by necessity linked.</li>
<li>Since the Ancap definition of "anarchism" is synonymous with anti-statism alone, any relevant Ancap material can be added to that article.</li>

<p>I've been trying to NPOVify the ancap article, and my experience seems to indicate that the whole problem stems from a linguistic dispute over the proper definition of Anarchism. I believe both sides are correct. The English language is not as precise an instrument as we'd like it to be, and any solution is going to be, by definition, arbitrary. I suggest the compromise: Accept the socialist/collectivist defintion of the word "anarchism" as anti-capitalist and anti-statist, and use the more general, accurate, and less confusing term "anti-statism" for the Ancap definition of "anarchism" and allow the anti-statism article be a repository for tracing the history and development of anti-government philosophy in general, leaving this page to trace the history and development of socialist Anarchism. This isn't a matter of one side "winning" the debate, but of establishing a common lexicon where people on both sides might find it possible to write a mutually-agreed-upon articles. <a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESaswann_93bc.html" title="User:Saswann">Saswann</a> 30 June 2005 16:27 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Fish story</span></h2>
<p>For many years, the utility of fish in the oceans was rarely questioned until a seminal work, What is Sealife?, was published. In it the author, whom we'll call PP, strongly attacked sealife and advocated the extermination of it. He called himself an anicthist, from the Greek "an", meaning "absence of" and "icthus", meaning "fish".</p>
<p>His followers railed against fish, anemones, whales, sponges, barnacles, and many other ocean-dwellers.</p>
<p>Later on scientists found out that, contrary to how people used the term, a "whale" could not rightly be classified as a fish. They have hair. They breathe air into lungs. They breastfeed their young. They are warm-blooded. Their ancestors were even land-dwellers! That they happened to live in the ocean was not meaningful for scientists - they base their classifications on the structure of an organism, not where it resides.</p>
<p>Soon after, a new movement formed, whose proponents called themselves anictho-whalists. They considered themselves to be anicthists because of their thorough attacks on all fish. But they were very supportive of whales because, although one could easily be tempted to call them fish, they were clearly distinct.</p>
<p>Traditional anicthists were livid. "How can you support whales????" they asked. "You're spitting on the whole anicthist movement! Anicthists have always been strongly against all forms of sealife!"</p>
<p>"But," replied the anictho-whalists, "we're not claiming to be part of the traditional anicthist movement. But if you read any dictionary, which captures the normal usage of the term, you'll see we meet it because we're against fish."</p>
<p>"Oh, sure, if you want to narrowly rely on dictionaries to reflect meanings of words! "</p>
<p>"Um, yeah. And in fact, the original anicthists, like PP, defined anicthism in itself to be anti-fish, not anti-whale."</p>
<p>"That's because any moron who read What is Sealife? is going to walk away opposing whales, and only an idiot would think PP favored whales!"</p>
<p>"Of course he didn't favor whales - we're just saying he didn't define anicthism as anti-whale."</p>
<p>"What the hell is the difference anyway? How can you count something that LIVES IN THE OCEAN, HAS FINS, and even BREATHES UNDERWATER, as 'not a fish'?"</p>
<p>"There's nothing wrong with living in the ocean or having fins. It's the scales, the gills, the lack of hair that's a problem. And whales don't breathe underwater - that's a flawed inference based on a flawed understanding of an ocean tainted with fish. Just because an organism is underwater for a long time doesn't mean its breathing down there."</p>
<p>"Oh, and the sperm whale stays underwater for two hours without breathing, right?"</p>
<p>"YES!"</p>

<dd>Cute story, but as an analogy, it doesn't hold up. Anyhow, the argument that A/C's stipulate the definition of capitalism to be somehow different from the commonly understood definition doesn't change the anarchist position of being against the commonly understood definition of capitalism.

<dd>I don't understand. The anarcho-capitalists use the same "commonly understood" definition of <i>capitalism</i> as others. Why do you think otherwise?

<p>You don't see the parallels, do you, albamuth? Here is what actually happened:</p>
<p>For many years, the utility of government was rarely questioned until a seminal work, What is Property?, was published. In it the author, whom we'll call PP, strongly attacked property and advocated the abolition of it. He called himself an anarchist, from the Greek "an", meaning "absence of" and "archon", meaning "ruler".</p>
<p>His followers railed against government, property, hierarchy, coercion, usury, and wage labor.</p>
<p>Later on economists found out that, contrary to how things appeared, laborers actually did earn their marginal value except in cases of artificial intervention. This is because if it were possible to exploit a surplus value, the labor would be bid away at a higher price. That some entrepreneurs do make profits was not meaningful for economists - they base their findings on average profit, not highest profit, which is never guaranteed.</p>
<p>Then a new movement formed, whose proponents called themselves anarcho-capitalists. They considered themselves to be anarchists because of their thorough attacks on all rulers. But they were very supportive of private capital ownership because, although one could easily be tempted to call such owners rulers, they were clearly distinct.</p>
<p>Traditional anarchists were livid. "How can you support capitalism????" they asked. "You're spitting on the whole anarchist movement! Anarchists have always been strongly against all forms of hierarchy!"</p>
<p>"But," replied the anarcho-capitalists, "we're not claiming to be part of the traditional anarchist movement. And if you read any dictionary, which captures the normal usage of the term, you'll see we meet it because we're against government."</p>
<p>"Oh, sure, if you want to narrowly rely on dictionaries to reflect meanings of words! "</p>
<p>"Um, yeah. And in fact, the original anarchists, like PP, defined anarchism in itself to be anti-state, not anti-capitalism."</p>
<p>"That's because any moron who read What is Property? is going to walk away opposing capitalism, and only an idiot would think PP favored capitalism!"</p>
<p>"Of course he didn't favor capitalism - we're just saying he didn't define anarchism as anti-capitalist."</p>
<p>"What the hell is the difference anyway? How can you count something that PROMOTES INEQUALITY, HAS HIERARCHY, and even REQUIRES PEOPLE TO LIVE IN POVERTY, as 'not a ruler'?"</p>
<p>"There's nothing wrong with inequality or hierarchy in themselves. It's the forceful imposition of them that's a problem. And capitalism doesn't require people to live in poverty - that's a flawed inference based on a flawed understanding of a market tainted by states. Just because people live under poverty now doesn't mean the capitalist is causing it."</p>
<p>"Oh, so the plight of the working poor today has nothing to do with, say, capitalists treating them like dirt, right?"</p>
<p>"RIGHT!"</p>

<dd>So you're bringing up the old "dictionary def", which was dealt with approx. 200 Kb ago in talk pages - strawman. Then you bring up the "Proudhon didn't define anarchism as anti-capitalist" argument, which was also disproven. And now you say, "there's nothing wrong with inequality or hierarchy in themselves". So...why don't "anarcho-capitalists" call themselves "capitalarchists"? If there is no power structure but that created by access to capital, you would have capitalarchy, not anarchy. After the first wave died and they passed property on to children, you would then have an oligarchy. Is the point so obvious that I don't see it?

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>&gt;So you're bringing up the old "dictionary def", which was dealt with approx. 200 Kb ago in talk pages - strawman.</dd>
<dd>No, not a strawman. I have precisely characterized the traditional anarchist position, which is to disparage references to numerous actual dictionaries as "narrow". If you want me to dig up quotes from Kev and (probably) you, I will, if you don't delete them before then.</dd>
<dd>&gt;Then you bring up the "Proudhon didn't define anarchism as anti-capitalist" argument, which was also disproven.</dd>
<dd>If by "disproven" you mean "repeatedly and relentlessly misinterpreted as an argument claiming that Proudhon favored capitalism", then yes, it was disproven. However, in reality I haven't yet seen a traditional anarchist actually acknowledge a difference between "not defining anarchism as X" and "favoring X". The above scenario precisely characterizes the practice among traditional anarchists here of thinking that "Proudhon defined anarchism as anti-statist" means "Proudhon favored capitalism." Again, I can pull up quotes.</dd>
<dd>&gt;And now you say, "there's nothing wrong with inequality or hierarchy in themselves". So...why don't "anarcho-capitalists" call themselves "capitalarchists"? If there is no power structure but that created by access to capital, you would have capitalarchy, not anarchy.</dd>
<dd>Because the supposed hierarchy in owning capital is not a hierarchy in any economically or morally significant way. So I diverted some of my previous labor into capital goods, making me more productive. This, in and of itself, dominates you how? It is different from me making myself more productive by excercising how? Ancaps recognize certain hierarchies as being unavoidable or good: "I, not you, may dictate the uses to which my body is put. I, not you, may dictate how the product of my labor is to be used."</dd>
<dd>&gt;After the first wave died and they passed property on to children, you would then have an oligarchy. Is the point so obvious that I don't see it? Help me out here.</dd>
<dd>I would be glad to help you out. If you oppose inheritance, you oppose me deciding how my labor is to be used. If I want my labor to be used to assist my decendants in being productive, you oppress me by preventing this. It is no different from me selecting a desirable mate in order to have offspring which, as it may turn out, are more productive than others. The logical implication of traditional anarchist beliefs is to support making people equal in ability, preventing people from producing more than others, or stealing the product of their labor. But this is getting off onto a tangent of whose beliefs are right: the discussion here is whether traditional anarchists are justified in saying that ancaps are not true anarchists.</dd>

<p>Oops, I was busy writing this:</p>
<p>First, let's look at Lysander Spooner's&#160;:<i>OUR MECHANICAL INDUSTRY, AS AFFECTED BY OUR PRESENT CURRENCY SYSTEM: AN ARGUMENT FOR TUE AUTHOR’S “NEW SYSTEM OF PAPER CURRENCY.”</i> <a href="http://www.lysanderspooner.org/mechanicalindustry.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lysanderspooner.org/mechanicalindustry.htm" rel="nofollow">[23]</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Great as it is, this loss of one fifth of our industry could be born with comparative ease, if it came uniformly in each year, and fell equally upon all in proportion to their property. But it [*4] comes at intervals, and falls unequally. And it falls most heavily upon those least able to bear it. In the first place, it falls, in a greatly disproportionate degree, upon those who labor for daily or monthly wages; depriving them of a large part of their usual means of subsistence, compelling them to consume their accumulations, and often reducing them to absolute suffer­ing. In the second place, it is attended with a fall in prices, which sweeps away, at half its usual market value, the property of thousands, in payment of debts, that had been contracted under high prices; thus bringing upon such persona either utter bankruptcy, or grievous impoverishment. <i>In this way a large portion of the people are kept in perpetual poverty; whereas if their industry were but uninterrupted, and the prices of property stable, nearly everybody would acquire competence</i>. Thus the inequality, with which the loss falls upon the people, makes the loss a far greater evil than it otherwise would be.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Secondly, let's look at the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_hierarchy.html" title="Social hierarchy">social hierarchy</a> article:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Social hierarchy is a phrase used to describe the distribution of political power, wealth, and/or social status among people within a national or cultural group. Usually, the distribution is "pyramidal"— a few people are very powerful, while most have little or no power.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Spooner was very much against slavery and poverty. The super-exaggerated discrepancies in wealth distribution of the middle industrial age were not an issue -- there was rich, poor, and all the ranges in between. However, the wealthy then (late 1800's) were not the kind of wealthy we have today (the 20% that make 80% of the money, or the richest 2% that own 90% of all wealth, whatever those numbers are), tying up vast amounts of resources for their private use. Wealthy in 1870 (if your were a Southerner) meant owning a large plantation and a few thousand slaves. Wealthy up North meant owning a company like Sears-Roebuck. Compared to the rich of today, proportionally, the rich of then were small fries, at least in the United States. Samuel Colt make a lot of money, but no more than your average pyramid-scheme mogul of today.</p>
<p>From his other writings, you can see that Spooner was very much against the privilege of wealth: In <i>Our Financiers: Their Ignorance, Usurpations, and Frauds (1877)</i> <a href="http://www.lysanderspooner.org/ourfinanciers.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lysanderspooner.org/ourfinanciers.htm" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> he writes:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps we may conclude that any privileged money whatever, whether issued by a government or by individuals, is necessarily a dishonest money; <b>just as a privileged man is necessarily a dishonest man</b>; and just as any other privileged thing is neces­sarily a dishonest thing. For this reason we may perhaps con­clude that a government that constantly cries out for “honest money,” when it all the while means and maintains, and insists [*11] upon maintaining, a privileged money, acts the part only of a blockhead or a cheat.

<dd>Spooner is talking about "privileged money" there. He's not opposed to people getting rich. He's opposed to them getting rich through government-banked monopoly on banking. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 18:50, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not saying he's against getting rich. I'm saying he's against the privilege of wealth. You can tell because in his argument against "privileged money", he's making a direct comparison to the evil of privileged persons -- the reason for the French and American Revolutions. Remember that he was a constitutionalist -- "All men are created equal..." He's not for equality of wealth, but for equality of rights. Privileges enjoyed by any over others = social hierarchy. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbamuth_eea6.html" title="User:Albamuth">albamuth</a> 19:11, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What do you say to this: "The moment we invade liberty to secure equality we enter upon a road which knows no stopping-place short of the annihilation of all that is best in the human race. If absolute equality is the ideal; if no man must have the slightest advantage over another, - then the man who achieves greater results through superiority of muscle or skill or brain must not be allowed to enjoy them. All that he produces in excess of that which the weakest and stupidest produce must be taken from him and distributed among his fellows. The economic rent, not of land only, but of strength and skill and intellect and superiority of every kind, must be confiscated. And a beautiful world it would be when absolute equality had been thus achieved! Who would live in it? Certainly no freeman." -Benjamin Tucker <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 18:41, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are confusing being against social hierarchy with being against equal distribution of all wealth, as in a communist society with a command economy. Tucker/Spooner both supported to right of inventors to retain patents and enjoy material rewards for their intellect. If <a href="../../../t/e/s/Tesla.html" title="Tesla">Tesla</a> somehow created an empire from his wealth, exploiting workers, and enjoying privileges of power, I think both Tucker and Spooner would have some harsh words for him. In modern times, Tucker would say something like: "I don't think we should all be driving Volkswagons. Any worker should be able to afford and maintain a new car without going heavily in debt, but doctors and scientists, having earned through skill and ingenuity, should have every right to drive around in a Mercedes or Aston-Martin. Look at the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Privilege.html" title="Privilege">Privilege</a> article.

<dd>It looks to me like you both agree that Spooner was against unequal political power, but not unequal wealth or social status, the latter two being the natural result of liberty. So the quibble is over whether <i>individual anarchists oppose social hierarchy.</i> Technically, if you go by the Wiki definition above, Alba's claim is correct - they do oppose social hierarchy as defined as the disjunction of three criteria. <b>But</b> I agree with RC11 that it is misleading to phrase it that way, because most people will misinterpret it to mean <i>against differences in wealth.</i> It would be clearer to say individual anarchists were against unequal political power, in order to avoid the erroneous impression that they are against unequal wealth or social status.</dd>

<p>Do you understand what "privilege" means yet? One social group (industrialists) has special privileges given to them by authorities. When one group of people has power over another group of people within a society, you have a '<i>social hierarchy</i>. It's that simple. <i>Voluntary</i> employer-employee relations, as Tucker advocates in "Voluntary Cooperation a Remedy" is not a social hierarchy, it is a <i>contract</i> between individuals. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbamuth_eea6.html" title="User:Albamuth">albamuth</a> 16:17, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Tucker is saying he opposed government-backed monopoly that causes "privileges." Anyway, do you deny that an employer has a sort of "power" over his employee? It may be contractual but it's still hierarchical. The problem with saying anarchists oppose "social hierarchy" is that it's very vague. It could be changed to "involutary social hiearchy" or "coercive social hierarchy" and it would be just fine. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 17:06, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>You even put, yourself, into the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_hierarchy.html" title="Social hierarchy">social hierarchy</a> article: "commonly superiors, called bosses, have more power than their subordinates."

<dl>
<dd>I would say that that is a <i>workplace hierarchy</i>. If the employer restricts the liberty of the employee, even after a voluntary contract is enjoined, Tucker would be foaming and spitting mad. If the object of the employer-employee relationship is that of an experienced craftsman teaching apprentices the ways of the craft, and in turn receiving help in the form of labor, AND PAYING THEM THE FULL WORTH OF THEIR LABOR, Tucker and Spooner would both be satisfied. Check out <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parecon.html" title="Parecon">balanced job complex</a> for an idea of non-hierarchical workplace organization. Here's a salient quote:

<dd>I don't know what that has to do with employee/employer relations. He's talking about private defense forces that protect liberty and property (like anarcho-capitalists advocate). Anyway, you call employee/employer "workplace hierarchy" instead of social hierarchy. I'm sure there are others who would call it social hierarchy. The problem is that "social hierarchy" is really vague and can lead to all kinds of interpretations. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 04:11, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps I wasn't clear. Workplace hierarchy is a social hierarchy. Tucker vehemently objected to the way the big labor unions protected their monopoly on skill, rather than allowing each worker to learn and progress as they were capable to. He saw that as a restriction on liberty. That exerpt (which is not about private defense forces, it is about cooperative , public defense forces) precisely illustrates Tucker's emphasis on the maximization of liberty. In a workplace, or in a society, if liberty is curtailed by certain people, anarchists should band together to fight the enemies of liberty. Privilege of some curtails the liberty of others, or means that those others are not as free as they should be. Working harder or more skillfully to earn more and thus drive a nicer car is not a privilege, in the sense of rights, because it is earned. Social hierarchy is the stratification of society according to privilege, or other rights assignated arbitrarily. The individualists are therefore against social hierarchy. It seems pretty clear to me. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbamuth_eea6.html" title="User:Albamuth">albamuth</a> 04:26, 22 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes he is talking about private defense forces. Private, in this sense, just means not government owned. Anarcho-capitalists favor the same thing ..voluntary defense by private individuals (private meaning not government-affiliated). A public defense force would be a government. Aside from that, what do you mean Tucker says anarchists should band together to fight employers? Tucker advocated that violence not be used. If someone didn't like their boss retaining profit from wages, the individualist anarchist just walks away and set up their own business based on the labor theory of value, and respects the liberty of others to enter into profit arrangements in employment if they're foolish enough to do so. So you say "workplace hierarchy is a social hierarchy." Is having a boss who pays an employee the full produce of his labor workplace hierarchy? I say it is. A boss is a boss, even if he's paying you more. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 04:46, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Public" defense, as in protecting the liberty of everyone, not just the owner(s) of that defense force. I also never said anything about fighting employers. A boss is a boss is a boss, but think a little more about the boss-employee relationship: in a <i>voluntary</i> system, the employee agrees to do work the boss assigns in exchange for money. In a system where employment was readily available for all who wanted to work (Spooner made many arguments against impovrishment and unemployment), any employee that was being mistreated could leave to another job or start their own business. Such mistreatment includes using managerial position to leverage power. The management-employee relationship, is ideally a cooperative arrangement to get things done. Overstepping that arrangement into the realm of <b>coercive power</b> (the term you keep reinserting into the intro) curtails the liberty of the worker. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbamuth_eea6.html" title="User:Albamuth">albamuth</a> 05:11, 22 July 2005 (UTC)

<p>Tucker was <i>not</i> against the so-called "workplace hierarchy" unless someone was making a profit off of it. Tucker was not against hired labor at all, so long as the work was paid at full price. However, Tucker agreed with Herbert Spencer's "Law of Equal Freedom", and supported the <i>right</i> to make a profit off of labor. He thought it was wrong, but a right nevertheless. Kind of like staying drunk all the time is wrong, but one has the right to do so. Spooner would say it's a vice but not a crime.</p>

<p>RJ, you rv calling it a "meaningless term", but you fight the usage on the talk pages by saying that 1) it does not apply to individualist-anarchists and 2) that is vague and prone to misinterpretation. If you think the term is meaningless, then let's discuss that.</p>
<dl>
<dd>By meaningless, I mean that it's subject to different interpretations. I'm not aware of any universal meaning of the term. And the Wikipedia article sure doesn't help. To me, it can mean a variety of things, differing levels of wealth among individuals as well as the employer/employee situation. But, that's just my interpretation. And you have yours. Nobody seems to know what exactly it is, if it's anything. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 05:22, 22 July 2005 (UTC) By the way, where is this "social hierarchy" stuff coming from?

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Social hierarchy is a lot more specific than simply saying that anarchism is against all hierarchy. Scientists studying behavior of animals use the term a lot; sociologists and anthropologists as well, without bothering to define it. A Google search turns up as much. It hardly needs its own special definition -- it's merely a compound word, formed of words most people understand. A society has politics; political hierarchy is certainly objected to by anarchists. What is the big deal? The term aptly describes what anarchists object to: a society in which some individuals have more liberties/rights/privileges than others. It doesn't in any way imply "equality", which I'm sure you would have an objection to. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbamuth_eea6.html" title="User:Albamuth">albamuth</a> 17:07, 22 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Then what do you say to this, from the anarcho-capitalism article: "The traditions that object to the term anarcho-capitalism tend to use the term "anarchism" to refer to a particular group of socialist political movements, and use a general definition that includes rejection of all hierarchical social organization, rather than just the state. They regard the uneven distribution of wealth among individuals in a capitalist system as inherently hierarchical. Therefore, they see anarcho-capitalism as antithetical to the principles of anarchy." According to you, this is wrong, correct? Uneven distribution of wealth is not social hierarchy. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 18:09, 26 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The key phrase is <i>the uneven distribution of wealth among individuals</i> <b>in a capitalist system</b>. In a capitalist economic system, wealth bestows priviliges to the owners of it, according to anarchists. So I don't think that is wrong. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbamuth_eea6.html" title="User:Albamuth">albamuth</a> 03:53, 27 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The only way you can have unequal wealth distribution is if you have private property. The reason that private property is opposed is because it leads to unequal distributions of wealth. These class distinctions in wealth are exactly what the communist anarchists oppose. And it's what they mean by social hierarchy. They say they oppose uneven wealth distribution in a capitalist system, with the understanding that a capitalist system has private property and that private property is the reason for uneven wealth distribution. Saying that one opposes private private property goes hand in hand with saying that one is for equal wealth distribution. I think the "social hierarchy" thing really only applies to the communist anarchism . Now that individualist anarchism is in the article it doesn't really apply. I know you've adjusted it to have a precise meaning, but I foresee problems because "social hierarchy" goes beyond that for anarcho-communists. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 04:47, 27 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Without getting back into the whole "what is private property?" debate, the conclusion of "unequal wealth distribution = social hierarchy" may be drawn by some anarchists and not others, but it doesn't mean that those others don't oppose social hierarchy for their own reasons, as I was trying to demonstrate earlier, of the individualist anarchists. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbamuth_eea6.html" title="User:Albamuth">albamuth</a> 05:09, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Anarcho nationalism is a part of rascist and far right-wing movements. This is rascist ideology. And this is one of many proof that it's NOT enough to be against state to call yourself anarchist. Maybe we should put here somalia as an example of "anarchist country"? There is almost ideal anarcho-capitalism and anarcho-nationalism with class and ethnic bosses at the top of pyramid of power.--XaViER 11:24, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Any common one. But ACs don't use Proudhon's definition, they actively distort the meaning of the words he uses. This is obvious from the fact that they come to conclusions that blatantly contradict his own concerning the meaning of those words and the use of that very definition.

<p>The old-timey socialist anarchists just don't "know the way the wind blows," apparently. They want to freeze anarchism in 1880, and refuse to acknowlege the up and coming philosophies and movements. In the words of Voltairine de Cleyre, advocate of anarchism without adjectives:</p>
<p><i>"there is nothing unanarchistic about any of them until the element of compulsion enters and obliges unwilling persons to remain in a community whose economic arrangements they do not agree to."</i></p>

<dd>Even the some of the "old-timeys" didn't have a POV definition.

As to their economical conceptions, the anarchists, in common with all socialists, of whom they constitute the left wing, maintain that the now prevailing system of private ownership in land, and our capitalist production for the sake of profits, represent a monopoly which runs against both the principles of justice and the dictates of utility. They are the main obstacle which prevents the successes of modern technics from being brought into the service of all, so as to produce general well-being.

<dd>That says "the anarchists." It doesn't say one has to oppose profits to be an anarchist. Anarchism is defined as the top of the article. It's just that capitalist-anarchists didn't exist in 1910. As anarchism is defined, anarcho-capitalism definitely fits. Anarcho-capitalists believe in voluntary relations. The support profit if both sides contract to a profit arrangement. Traditional American individualist anarchists, opposed profit as being inconstistent with the labor theory of value, but they would allow it to occur since it was contracted. And, it's not only anarchists that oppose ownership of raw land. Classical liberals, such as Locke, Jefferson, etc, also opposed it --nothing special about traditional anarchists in that respect. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 19:48, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Christian Anarchism</span></h2>
<p>RJ11, will you please provide documentation to prove your claim that Christian anarchists oppose tax resistence? I can show that its founder, Tolstoy, supported tax resistence, as did many of the Quaker anarchists, so I don't agree with your generalization at all.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, this is from Tolstoy's work "The Kingdom of God is Within You": "</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>Q. Can he pay taxes to such a government?</i></p>
<p><i>A. No; he ought not voluntarily to pay taxes, but he ought not to resist the collecting of taxes. A tax is levied by the government, and is exacted independently of the will of the subject. It is impossible to resist it without having recourse to violence of some kind. Since the Christian cannot employ violence, he is obliged to offer his property at once to the loss by violence inflicted on it by the authorities.</i></p>
<p>-How's that? <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 16:21, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
"Mine is the true revolutionary method. If the people of the empire refuse, as I believe they should refuse, to render military service - if they decline to pay taxes to support that instrument of violence, an army - the present system of government cannot stand." - Tolstoy</p>
<p>RJ11, in the quote you gave, Tolstoy answered, "No; he ought not voluntarily to pay taxes." So he <i>did</i> support tax resistence. I think you have misunderstood the rest of the quote due to the non-standard use (or translation from Russian?) of the word "resist." (which is understandable, unless you'd read the book.) In "The Kingdom..." the word "resist" means the use of violence or evil. I.e. chapter 1 title: "THE DOCTRINE OF NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL BY FORCE...". Then he quoted William Lloyd Garrison and Ballou:</p>
<p><i>Q. Ought the word "non-resistance" to be taken in its widest sense--that is to say, as intending that we should not offer any resistance of any kind to evil?</i></p>
<p><i>A. No; it ought to be taken in the exact sense of our Saviour's teaching--that is, not repaying evil for evil. We ought to oppose evil by every righteous means in our power, but not by evil.</i></p>
<p>The quote you gave, RJ11, means that Tolstoy supports non-violent tax resistance, but not resistance such as mugging tax-collectors.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Why anarchism is not merely "anti-state"</span></h2>
<p>Here's a stepwise progression:</p>
<ol>
<li>orginially called "libertarians" (and still called that outside the U.S.), anarchists were all for maximizing liberty.</li>
<li><i>liberty for all</i> does not exist when some people have <i>more liberty</i> than others.</li>
<li>privilege / social hierarchy therefore, curtail equal liberty in a society</li>
<li>the economic policies of capitalism creates social hierarchies</li>
<li>the State defends Capitalist (classical liberal, neo-liberal) economic policies, as well as the social hierarchy of its own power structure</li>
<li>therefore, in order to achieve maximum liberty for all, anarchists seek to do away with Capitalism and the State.</li>
</ol>
<p>To call anarchism simply "anti-state" is highly innaccurate and oversimplified. <b>I am not making a case for not including anarcho-capitalism</b>, merely trying to lay the whole "anti-state" definition to rest. It would be like calling <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> anti-materialist.

</dl>
<p>Anarchism isn't based on being "anti-state", as some A/C proponents have argued. Rather, anarchism arrived at the anti-state conclusion after considering the economic and power relations of the prime agents within society. Now, keep in mind that this a <i>historical</i> view of anarchist ideals. Starting with Kropotkin's "scientific socialism", there have been many theoretical advancements inculcated into anarchism, and quite a few that have been left behind in obsolescence.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>3) Only if it involves coercion aka <i>rights violations</i> aka <i>initiation of force</i>. Voluntary hierarchies are permissable, and do not detract from liberty. They should not be coercively prevented.</dd>
<dd>4) Not coercive ones.</dd>
<dd>5) I agree with the second part - the State definitely defends its power, and tends to grow like cancer. The first part is totally wrong: the State is the enemy of property rights and a free market. Most socialists seem to be unable to discern the difference between stateless laissez faire and corporatism. It's weird.</dd>
<dd>6) Only those misguided anarchists who don't realize that many people prefer stateless, voluntary capitalism. Like Voltairine, I say let all economic theories compete freely in the market.</dd>

<dd>So basically you're calling anarchists a bunch of idiots by analogy. Why not just say "they're stupid -- they don't know what they're talking about" instead of trying to use a story about how mammals are not fish? Besides, the reason whales are "mammals" and not "fish" is by virtue of the Linnean taxonomic classification system. You might as well call them all "multicellular organisms". All the divisions and classifications that you're making such a big deal about is not contributing towards the quality of the article. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbamuth_eea6.html" title="User:Albamuth">albamuth</a> 13:28, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If I can show neutral observers how unreasonable it is to marginalize anarcho-capitalism, I think that contributes to the quality of the article. Now, am I calling anarchists stupid? No, of course not. I just think they use a rather unhelpful definition of domination/exploitation/rulership. An inexperienced observer may balk at the claim that whales are not fish, since they have so many superficial similarities. But a dispassionate analysis of the facts shows whales to be very distinct. Likewise, an observer might balk at the claim that a boss is not a ruler, because of the superficial similarities, ignoring the far more numerous deviations. Is it stupid to think that whales are fish? Most people think whales are fish on first introduction to the two, so no. But they're wrong, or more specifically, no scientific classification can put them together. And further, if there were a word that, according to most dictionaries, meant "favoring the absence of fish", I would think anyone wanting to get rid of fish would meet it, even if most people self-describing that way historically hated whales too.24.243.188.29 01:07, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I love when people try to rearrange their arguments as a deductive chain. They think they're making their case stronger by showing how it follows of logical necessity, but in reality they're showing how minor flaws in one step destroy their case utterly. I don't find such logic-chopping productive. So let's begin. In 2) you shift from supporting maximal liberty to supporting liberty for all. If they're the same thing, 2) is a non-sequitur because maximal liberty could obtain, for example, when A has 2 liberty and B has 3 liberty. Perhaps you mean maximal *equal* liberty. While we're not looking, you in fact do shift to this in 3). 4) is true, but it unfortunately also holds for the economic policies of anti-capitalism. Seizing the product of my labor to level out a potential hierarchy is itself a hierarchy. (Traditional anarchists like to get around this by claiming that, no, they're just taking direct action to maintain a state of anarchy, but who do they think they're fooling?) 5) is true - sometimes. Sometimes states enforce private property rights. Usually they violate them and more often support socialist economic policies (income redistribution, social security, exemption from prosecution for union violence and on and on and on). *Some* people who call themselves anarchist look at all superficially hierarchical occurrences and want to get rid of them; the more honest ones favor preventing women from trying to look beautiful because that creates a hierarchy in which they can get what they want from men more easily. There is plenty of room for debate on what constitutes an undesirable hiearchy. So ancaps find it less distateful to allow a worker-boss "hierarchy" to develop than to force a hierarchy by expropriating someone's labor. So traditional anarchists find it less distasteful to seize the labor of the more productive than to allow a worker-boss hierarchy to develop. Does that make one more anarchist than another?</dd>

Since that probably doesn't answer your question, I can only guess at what you mean. Example: say there's a traditional anarchist system that involves money (and please don't deny that they exist). Under that system, let's say a bunch of friends and I save up our money and trade it for a factory, then hire workers for a wage. Many traditional anarchists would be totally okay with them taking over the factory because I didn't share the profits with them. That's expropriation of my and my friends' labor because we earned the money through labor and traded it for a factory. Does that clear up what I'm getting at? 24.243.188.29 02:46, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>So anarchists advocate "seizing the labor of the more productive"? That's a rather epithetical characterization of syndicalism. Insulting, and untrue. Syndicalists advocate "seizing the means of production away from the unproductive" -ie workers taking control of factories. Anarchists in general do not think owners and bosses have been "productive" simply from moving capital around and telling people to work harder -- even the individualist-anarchists agree.
<dl>
<dd>Yes, and that's a very narrow view of the role of the capitalist in free market. But we'll never be able to convince each other on that point here. Regardless, I have heard traditional anarchists say that merely having more money or wealth (two different things, btw) than someone is a form of domination. If people were compensated according to their productivity - however you define that - then in order to maintain equality, you would have to, yes, steal from the more productive. So at least some - probably most - advocate stealing from the more productive. Traditional anarchists seem to want to have it both ways: pay people the true value of their work AND prevent inequalities.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Secondly, your example is ridiculous. Why would you need to buy a factory in a mutualist-currency system? It's pointless to even own a factory, since every worker in a mutualist system (the only historical example of anarchist economics I can think of besides Kropotkin's anarcho-communism) will get paid fully for their labor and the products sold exactly at the cost of labor. There are no profits for you to keep. Nobody's going to take over your factory if you decide you want to make a profit -- but you'd have to use some sort of capitalism-enabled currency system, not an anarchist one. So again, you're arguing against a position that does not exist, otherwise known as a "straw-man". --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbamuth_eea6.html" title="User:Albamuth">albamuth</a> 13:28, 25 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Not a strawman. First of all, the *goal* in mutualism is to get workers to be paid what, according to socialist formulas, is the value of their labor. Nothing stops me from *offering* less than the formulaic amount, nor people from *accepting* such offers, unless you like intervening in mutually beneficial transactions - but I'd drop the "pro-free market" rhetoric if you are. It's typical of traditional anarchists to assert that "there's no X in my system" without specifying what they would do to stop X from arising. If someone ran the numbers and decided I wasn't giving them enough of the profits, they would have no problem seizing the factory that *I* and my friends worked hard to raise the money for. 24.243.188.29 01:20, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

Sorry, albamuth, but USer 24.243. and RJII do have a point. First, you didn't answer 24.243's claim that your logical chain is, in fact, illogical (something I believe as well). The onus is on you on that one. Second: selling the products for the cost of labour won't work because the price is decided by the consumers. They buy according to their preferences, and if they don't like the price, they won't buy. If the cost of labour is too high, no-one will buy the products, and they will pile up, and in the end you'll have to fire the people (or keep over-producing endlessly). If the price of labour is too low, people will buy too much of the stuff, which may be harmful as well (eg. think of what would happen if hamburgers were sold at a very cheap price). BTW I don't see how this part of the discussion really concerns anarchism - it's rather the kind of discussion I'd be having on <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">Communism</a>. <a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuis_rib_dc5a.html" title="User:Luis rib">Luis rib</a> 19:19, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It doesn't. What I was refering to is mutualism, an economic theory propounded by Tucker and still... well, <i>theorized</i> about by contemporary individualist anarchists (see <a href="http://www.mutualism.org" class="external text" title="http://www.mutualism.org" rel="nofollow">Mutualism.org</a>). Secondly, I never said it was a logical chain, only a summary of the reasoning behind anarchists objecting to the state. The phrase "maximum liberty" is misleading, I must admit. Saying "the maximum possible, simultaneous range of liberties available to every member of a society that do not infringe upon the liberties of others within that society" is a little long-winded. But then again, this is not a philosophical argument that I wish to make (which is how it was interpreted), only <b>an illustration of the anarchist point of view</b>, no matter how "illogical" it may be in my humble choice of words, which are based on premises drawn from the anarchist analysis of the world.

Claiming that the State defends classical liberal ideas??? What??? To get that, you'd have to ignore almost everything the State does, including its *socialist* economic policies. That's what bothered me the most: how when the state pitches in to help protect pre-existing private property rights, well, according to you, that's characteristic of everything the state does. But when it redistributes income, punishes productivity, implements socialist retirement schemes, oh, well, that's just part of the natural order of things and the state has nothing to do with it. Why the narrow focus on the (arguably) pro-capitalist things the state does? I guess it regresses back to the whole argument about "Property is based on violence." "Possession is based on violence too." "Yeah, but that violence is okay because it's not exploitation." "What's exploitation?" "When you do something I disagree with."

In reality, some anarchists, like me, recognize the very obvious fact that states promote socialism too. In response, you say we're not anarchists. So what again was the purpose of this exercise? At least with the fish story I was able to characterize the dispute between traditional anarchists and ancaps - that they have reasonable, differing views on what a ruler is. Here, all you're doing is saying anarchists believe this because anarchists believe it - the anarchists you approve of, of course. 24.243.188.29 06:47, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>And so on and so forth. This solves the following problems: 1) the fact that anarchism really doesn't have "schools" in any reasonable sense, as every single anarchists' ideas are slightly different yet usually compatible 2) anarcho-capitalism is included without having to be defined as "anarchist or not", simply as a branch of thought that history has yet to reveal the outcome of 3) it covers the terms ("anarcho-primitivism", "anarcho-communism") as they come up in history without creating the misconception that they represent rival gangs of anarchists 4) the "History" section can be greatly reduced, eliminated, or merged, reducing article size and redundancy 5) the "Conflicts" can be addressed as part of the history of anarchism 6) people wishing to find out about the specific terms can still find them in the article</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">stipulative definition of private property</span></h2>
<p>Why the hell are you deleting that anarcho-communists and anarcho-syndicalists are for the abolition of private property? You said something about them having a "stipulative definition." But, they don't have a different definition than anyone else. What's up? This is from an anarcho-syndicalist article "<b>The primary goal of Anarcho-Syndicalist activism is to abolish the wages system through the abolition of the insitution of private property and the class-divided society it creates.</b>" --from anarchosyndicalism.net They and communist anarchists use the term "private property" ...so that's exactly the term that should be used. You think they have some special definition? What do you think that is? <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 05:32, 27 July 2005 (UTC) I can't believe it. I get resistance when I say that individualist anarchists support private property, and I also get resistence when I say that communists anarchists oppose it. This crap has got to stop. It almost seems as if the editors that support these philosophies are embarrassed about what they stand for. It's very strange. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 05:38, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Individualist anarchist Lysander Spooner defines: "the principle of individual property ... says that each man has an absolute dominion, as against all other men, over the products and acquisitions of his own labor." You say communist have a "stipulative definition." What is it then? Enough bullshit. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 13:46, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Common usage of "private property", according to the wikipedia article:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In common use, property is simply 'one's own thing' and refers to the relationship between individuals and the objects which they see as being their own to dispense with as they see fit. Scholars in the social sciences frequently conceive of property as a 'bundle of rights and obligations.' They stress that property is not a relationship between people and things, but a relationship between people with regard to things. Property is often conceptualized as the rights of 'ownership' as defined in law.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>So without explaining the anarchist separation of private property and personal property, simply stating that "X-anarchists are against private property" becomes misleading. Having to explain that for each section in 'Schools' would bloat the article significantly, so that nuance is better explained in the sub-articles. Even Spooner, as you quoted him, is using the term <i>individual property</i> -- tell me, does he mean <i>private</i> property, instead? This is another problem that could be solved with the suggestion I made above. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbamuth_eea6.html" title="User:Albamuth">albamuth</a> 15:37, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Of course Spooner means private property. That's what private property is ..property of an individual. Maybe the problem here is that a few of you just don't know what private property is. What "nuance" are you talking about? Communist and syndicalists don't have another non-standard definition for private property. You say that but you are unable to come up with one. Private property is individual property ..that which an individual has absolute dominion over. The reason communists oppose it is because it's not egalitarian ..it leads to different social classes. If individuals have property and wages they can keep accumulating that property and form a class division. That would be "to each according to his ability", and a violation of the maxim "FROM each according to his ability, to each according to his needs." I suggest you read this section of the anarcho-syndicalist FAQ <a href="http://www.anarchosyndicalism.net/faq/1b.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.anarchosyndicalism.net/faq/1b.htm" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 16:07, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Check out the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Private_property.html" title="Private property">private property</a> article. Saying that syndicalists oppose all private property would mean to the average reader that no syndicalist would have their own pair of shoes, which is false, of course. I'm not arguing against your definition of it, which is a scholarly one, but the utility of using it in the article without extensive stipulation is misleading. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbamuth_eea6.html" title="User:Albamuth">albamuth</a> 16:20, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, if someone is so dense to think that the abolition of private property means people would be naked, then we can always say they want it to be replaced with collective property. How's that? <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 16:25, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>But that's not how anarchists conceive collective property working. Nobody wants to share underwear, not even anarchists, and this extends to a great number of things.

And what about the metaphysical, Kantian objection to the very notion of property? The whole matter is quite complicated.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Proposal to spin off "Schools of anarchism" section into Alternative models of anarchism</span></h2>
<p>Looking over the article in its present state, I feel that it devotes way too much space to the section on "Schools of anarchism." This is going to be very misleading to a reader who doesn't know much about anarchism, because it gives the impression that there's no over-all coherence to anarchist thought, when in fact there is. I've known a lot of anarchists, and none of them believed in capitalism, Christianity, racial separatism, or nationalism. I don't think that there's any question that <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_anarchism.html" title="Christian anarchism">Christian anarchism</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_anarchism.html" title="Black anarchism">black anarchism</a>, and <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_anarchism.html" title="National anarchism">national anarchism</a> exist; that they have more members than could meet in a VW bug; and that they deserve their own articles. However, they're utterly unimportant when seen against the backdrop of anarchism in general, and IMO it's wildly inappropriate that "Schools of anarchism" currently takes up almost half of the whole article. I'd like to propose spinning off that entire section into a separate article, Alternative models of anarchism. And just to put my cards on the table, I'm a libertarian, not an anarchist, and my main focus on WP is articles about the history of racism in the U.S. I'm actually more in sympathy with <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> than with mainstream anarchism, so I'm not suggesting this as a way of attacking ideologies I disagree with; I simply think the article is unbalanced and misleading in its present state. I think spinning off this content (as has already been done with the anarchism template) could really help to eliminate the constant infighting that has afflicted this article.--<a href="../../../b/c/r/User%7EBcrowell_f3ce.html" title="User:Bcrowell">Bcrowell</a> 16:22, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think the "constant infighting" is harming the article but helping it. There is no point in having a stagnant article for the sake of stagnancy. The article is is better than it was several months ago, and it couldn't have happened without conflict. I'm not judging your proposal, but to try to find ways to push disputes off into the corner is not the way to go, in my opinion. The quality and dynamism of the articles is more important than the contentment of the editors. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 16:42, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>I don't think the "constant infighting" is harming the article but helping it.</i> I disagree. The NPOV template at the top of the article is an admission of defeat; it tells prospective readers that the content of the article isn't trustworthy, and I think it's true that the content of the article isn't trustworthy, because it's unbalanced. And even putting aside the issue of balance, the organization of the article is completely incomprehensible. For instance, the section on "Conflicts within anarchist thought" has random material thrown into it on the McKinley assassination, the Haymarket Riot, and anarchism's demonization in the press. In my experience, the first thing that happens when an article goes into a revert-war tailspin is that the quality of the article stagnates and/or deteriorates.--<a href="../../../b/c/r/User%7EBcrowell_f3ce.html" title="User:Bcrowell">Bcrowell</a> 17:00, 28 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that that there's a lot of garbage as well as bad writing in this article. But, it was worse before. I think the worse parts are the sections that people haven't been fighting over, but neglecting ..like anarcho-communism and anarcho-syndicalism. I've started to do a little work on those sections and have started to encounter some resistance (it didn't even bother to mention that anarcho-syndicalism and communism oppose private property, if you can believe it). So hopefully better things for those sections are in store. As far as it being unbalanced, you should have seen it before --individualist anarchism was ignored as if it didn't exist. Fortunately, I was able to get that section in. It looks like in the past this article was edited by people who thought all anarchism was collectivist-based.

<p>It still needs to be organized better so particular concepts stand out, in their own subsection. Each subsection should start with the inculcation of the concept into anarchism, the history of it within anarchism, and end with either how the concept was dropped/replaced/merged/cemented in anarchist culture in the case of "history", or its current standing (controversy/conflict) in the case of contemporary anarchism. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbamuth_eea6.html" title="User:Albamuth">albamuth</a> 06:16, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>We are adversaries, and yet the goal which we both pursue is the same. What is the common goal of economists and socialists? Is it not a society where the production of all the goods necessary to the maintenance and embellishment of life shall be as abundant as possible, and where the distribution of these same goods among those who have created them through their labour shall be as just as possible? May not our common ideal, apart from all distinction of schools, be summarised in these two words: abundance and justice?</p>
<p>Such, none among you can deny, is our common goal. Only we approach this goal by different paths; you proceed along the obscure and hitherto unexplored defile of the organisation of labour, while we proceed along the broad and well-known highway of liberty. Each of us is attemping to lead in train a hesitating and groping society that scans the horizon seeking, but in vain, the pillar of light that formerly guided the slaves of the Pharaohs to the Promised Land.</p>
<p>Why do you refuse to follow the path of liberty alongside us? Because, you say, this liberty which we so extol is fatal to the labourers; because it has thus far produced only the oppression of the weak by the strong; because it has give birth to disastrous crises in which millions of men have lost in some cases their fortunes and in other cases their lives; because liberty unbridled, unregulated, unlimited – is anarchy!</p>
<p>Is this not the reason that you reject liberty? is this not the reason that you demand the organisation of labour?</p>
<p>Well then, if we prove to you with sufficient clarity that all the evils which you attribute to liberty – or, to make use of an absolutely equivalent expression, to free competition – have their origin not in liberty but in the absence of liberty, in monopoly, in servitude; if we further prove to you that a society of perfect freedom, a society disencumbered of every restriction, of every fetter, such as has never been seen in history, would be exempted from the greatest part of the miseries of the present régime; if we prove to you that the organisation of such a society would be the best, the most just, the most favourable to advancement in the production and equality in the distribution of wealth; if we should prove all this, I ask, what would be your response? Would you continue to proscribe the freedom of labour and to inveigh against political economy, or would you, rather, rally openly to our banner, and employ all the precious fund of intellectual and moral forces with which nature has endowed you, to speed the triumph of our henceforth common cause, the cause of liberty? - A Dreamer <a href="http://praxeology.net/GM-LTS-I.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://praxeology.net/GM-LTS-I.htm" rel="nofollow">[28]</a></p>

<dd>I'm not sure how to make it any clearer. For communist-anarchists social heirarchy includes unequal distribution of wealth. Social hierarchy includes class distinction that exist simply by virtue of the lack of wealth egalitarianism. Try to find one individualist anarchist that says he opposes "social hierarchy." You won't. Then try to find any individualist that says he opposes unequal wealth distribution in a governmentless society. You won't. You'll find the reverse --that they oppose the communist ideas on that. So to say that anarchism is necessary opposed to "social hierarchy" is wrong. By the way, communism isn't based on anarchism. Anarchism was around before communist philosophy came. Communist-anarchism developed as a result of breaking away from Proudhon's individualism and mutualism. Communism is an ecnonomic system. Anarchism is the lack of government. When you put those two together you get communist-anarchism. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 17:46, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Started it off, but I don't want to be the only one working on it. It needs a LOT of citation, quotes, and follow-through of sections. I simply reorganized the text on the existing article.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">What is the purpose of this discussion?</span></h2>
<p>There seems to be two differing ideas on what the AC-inclusion discussion is all about:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>(a)</b> To discuss the proper place of "Anarcho-Capitalism" in the history of Anarchism.</dd>
<dd><b>(b)</b> To debate the validity of Anarcho-Capitalist theory.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I realize there will be overlaps between these two topics, but there doesn't need to be nearly as much as people might think. Debating the validity of Anarcho-Capitalism would be great, but I'm of the opinion that such a debate is starting to cloud the real issue: Anarcho-Capitalists claim "Anarchist" status; that's fine, but then what is their proper place in the history of Anarchism?</p>
<p>Can we please settle on what this discussion is meant to resolve? The "validity" debate can continue somewhere else. --TelemachusSneezed 19:22, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Unfortunately, a few ardent POV socialists like Kev have decided that anarcho-capitalism is not a valid form of anarchism, and routinely censors references to ancap. To those who see anarcho-capitalism as invalid, the answer to question (a) is 'There is <i>no</i> proper place in this article for it.'</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The two main demands of the <i>big tent</i> faction are 1) the definition of anarchism should not exclude anarcho-capitalism, and 2) anarcho-capitalism be included as a school. There are other less important disputes concerning whether anti-statist liberals such as Bastiat and Molinari should be included in history, and whether Molinari should be referred to as the first anarcho-capitalist.</dd>

Everyone knows that this is you Hogeye, this very IP address you are posting from now has already been banned once as a sock-puppet of yours, so there really isn't much credibility here. If you want to be honest, post as Hogeye after your ban is over, and stop running around as an anonymous and using anony proxies to avoid your ban. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 00:50, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I don't remember what the site was. Also, I just tried to access Wikipedia through one of the IP's being used, as a test, and I was able to ..i left a test edit as well on the user page.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Recurring flaws in intro</span></h2>
<p>I keep seeing flaws appear and disappear in the intro. Rather than edit them, I wanted to discuss them so we could resolve any disagreements and avoid an edit war, if that's possible. So what do I consider flaws?<br />
"In the place of centralized political structures, private ownership of the means of production," - individualist anarchists believed in private ownership of capital goods, so that statement should be removed or qualified.<br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Absolutely they don't oppose private ownership of the means of production. I find it bizarre that Kevehs claims to be an individualist anarchist, but is unaware of this fact. Here's a quote from Benjamin Tucker: ""...Proudhon and Warren found themselves unable to sanction any such plan as the seizure of capital by society. But, though <b>opposed to socializing the ownership of capital</b>, they aimed nevertheless to socialize its effects by making its use beneficial to all instead of a means of impoverishing the many to enrich the few... Just as the idea of taking capital away from individuals and giving it to the government started Marx in a path which ends in making the government everything and the individual nothing, so the idea of taking capital away from government-protected monopolies and putting it within easy reach of all individuals started Warren and Proudhon in a path which ends in making the individual everything and the government nothing." <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 04:01, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>"and exploitative economic practices, such as rent," - two problems: many if not most do not consider rent, in and of itself, exploitative. This needs to be reworded to indicate it is anarchists who make the characterization. Second, Leo Tolstoy, whom the article considers an anarchist, believed communities should rent out their land, since he was a Georgist. Of course, that's a bit ambiguous because it can be argued that he only wanted that as an intermediate step on the way to anarchism, though he would probably advocate non-violent resistance to those who refused to pay the ground rent in a fully anarchist society.<br />
"these movements favor social relations based upon ...community control," - again, the individualist anarchists didn't want community control.<br />
"While opposition to both the state and hierarchy are primary tenets of anarchism," - it needs to be clarified exactly what hierarchy refers to. Most anarchists favor the rights of possessors of an object to dispose of it over other claimants. This is, strictly speaking, a hierarchy, at least in the minds of many people, who will be confused by such a statement.<br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Communist anarchists oppose wealth inequality, because they result in class distinctions, which is why they oppose wages. If someone is paid wages (which is private property) then those who are wise enough to accumulate it become of another class. These class divisions as a result of differing levels of wealth are included in what the communist anarchists mean by social hierarchy. Individualist anarchist don't oppose this, much less even think in terms of classes. So it shouldn't be said that anarchists oppose "social hierarchy." <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 04:01, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I would like to hear the justifications for these statements in the introduction. 24.162.140.213 03:09, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>These issues are covered in the NPOV version of the article. E.g. "Thus "anarchism," in its most general meaning, is the belief that rulership is unnecessary and should be abolished. Various schools of anarchism interpret 'rulership' in various ways, ranging from opposition to the State to opposition to any hierarchy whatsoever."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Also in Kev's deletion spree, he deleted the sentence about Godwin opposing all organized cooperation. He said above in Talk that it was false. Well, this is from the Stanford Encyclopedia: "Godwin sketches his positive vision of the egalitarian society of the future, one which, having dispensed with all forms of organised co-operation, including orchestras and marriage, so as to ensure the fullest independence to each persons' judgment, will gradually witness the development of the powers of mind to the point that they gain ascendancy over physiological process allowing life to be prolonged indefinitely." <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 04:01, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your edit, "Godwin advocated an extreme type of individualism opposing every kind of organized cooperation among individuals" is simply untrue. When faced with your evidence from an encyclopedia, I must admit a weakness for defering the primary source of Godwin himself,</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Associations, as a measure intrinsically wrong, the wise man will endeavour to check and postpone, as much as he can. But, when the crisis arrives, he will not be induced by the irregularities of the friends of equality to remain neutral, but will endeavour to forward her reign, as far as the nature of the case shall appear to admit. It may even happen that, in the moment of convulsion, and the terror of general anarchy, something in the nature of association may be indispensably connected with the general safety. But, even granting this, it need not be prepared beforehand... It appears reasonable that, when a man is unjustly attacked by the whole force of the party in power, he should be countenanced and protected by men who are determined to resist such oppressive partiality, and prevent the rights of all from being wounded through the medium of the individual, as far as that can be done consistently with peace and-good order.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dd>Godwin did not oppose all organized cooperation, he opposed insitutionalized organizations and to a lesser extent was wary of any form of cooperation, but he in fact endorsed several forms as, at times, necessary and even beneficial.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And yes RJ, your decision to spur the deletion of a disambiguation page created by an anarcho-capitalist sympathizer as a solution to this on-going edit war, and thus destroy any attempt to reach Nat Krause's proposed solution, because you advocate an unending edit war as the desirable and inevitable nature of wikipedia, is noted. But really, you should note all the other attempts at compromise and solutions offered on both sides of the issue that you have destroyed as well, if you are in the mood to discuss your accomplishments. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 04:59, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Is that supposed to matter to me that the page was created by an "anarcho-capitalist sympathiser"? I don't sympathize with anyone. I'm just here to help relay the truth. I'm very open to compromise, but I won't compromise the NPOV policy. This article must not choose which anarchist philosophy is "real anarchism." When I got here, the only kind of anarchism that was mentioned was the communist type. Mention of individualist anarchism had long ago been deleted by POV warriors. So, I created an individualist anarchist section. I'm sure another will show up and delete that. I also put Christian anarchism in the article and encountered resistance (possibly because they don't say they oppose capitalism). I'm also putting in anarcho-capitalism, black anarchism, and national anarchism. I'm not a POV warrior. I don't pick sides. I'm just a warrior for truth and NPOV. There are three encyclopedias listed in the external links and none of them define anarchism anti-individualist, anti-capitalist, or anti-social hiearchy or any other such bullshit like you and a couple others are trying to insert. Anarchism is opposition to the existence of government, in favor of voluntary relations between individuals. It's as simple as that. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 05:48, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hypocrisy among the left-anarchists</span></h2>
<p>Okay, the socialist anarchists here seem to have a huge problem with labeling de Molinari as an anarcho-capitalist directly (if you ask them where his beliefs diverged from ancaps, they're a little light on details, but that's another story), because the term "anarcho-capitalist" was created long after his time. Yet, the current article labels several feminist anarchists and a feminist anarchist group as "anarcha-feminists" even though, as the anarcha-feminism article states, that term was not created until the 60's. If you want to argue that the article doesn't explicitly state that Emma Goldman, et al. were anarcha-feminists, it's very misleading to have EG's picture right there. Unless this inconsistency can be reconciled, I plan to either reference de Molinari as an anarcho-capitalist in all relevant places or change the references to the feminist anarchists to "influences" on anarcha-feminism, the way de Molinari is treated with respect to anarcho-capitalism</p>
