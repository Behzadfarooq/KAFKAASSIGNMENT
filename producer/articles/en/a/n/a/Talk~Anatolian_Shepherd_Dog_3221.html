<p>I put the sketch of the dog in the breed box because there's no person in the picture, BUT (1) it's not a very large picture, and increasing its size makes it jagged and ugly, and (2) if you look at its copyright status, it says it's PD but it doesn't state the source (and it's a user who contributed only this image), so I'm guessing that its copyright status is really up in the air. Should I put the dog+person photo as the main photo? <a href="../../../e/l/f/User%7EElf_e89c.html" title="User:Elf">Elf</a> | <a href="../../../e/l/f/User_talk%7EElf_54a3.html" title="User talk:Elf">Talk</a> 23:44, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>According to some of the material I've read, Anatolians are a result of crossing Akbash and Karabash dogs indiscriminately under the conception that the two are basically the same breed (different color forms) as opposed to different breeds. That wouldn't make them the same as Karabash dogs; it would make them a melding of two breeds.</p>

<p>The karabash in the picture does not have the points and curly tail that is the trademark of the Kangal dog. I also removed "Kangal Dog" from the alternitive names. Wwe have an article called that, there was no need to put it as an alternitive name. <a href="../../../k/2E/v/User%7EK.vale_e3ed.html" title="User:K.vale">skorpion</a> 07:26, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>actually, (as the owner of an anatolian mix i know too much about this!) Kangal dogs ARE anatolian shepherds. So are Akbash and Karabash dogs. They ALL are. Anatolian Shepherd is the name that the AKC has lumped a bunch of dogs under, although they do vary slightly. They are all from the same region (Anatolia) in Turkey, so the AKC lumped them together. I am adding Kangal to the list of names again, because it is a valid alternate name. Sorry. check with the Turkish consulate if you disagree.&#160;:) But it is very confusing, i will admit. Olayak</p>
<p>I've removed Kangal from the alternative names list. They are absolutely not the same dog. Kangal (and, for that matter, Akbash) dogs are a genetically distinct phenotype, as shown by ALTUNOK, KOBAN, CHIKHI, SCHAFFER, PEDERSEN, NIZAMLIOGLU, TOGAN (2005) "<a href="http://www.piwet.pulawy.pl/doc/biuletyn_49-2/21_altunok.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.piwet.pulawy.pl/doc/biuletyn_49-2/21_altunok.pdf" rel="nofollow">Genetic Evidence For The Distinctness of Kangal Dogs</a>", <i>Bulletin of the Veterinary Institute in Pulawy</i> <b>49</b>, 249-254.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You mean genotype. Though not a geneticist, I do not think the authors succeed in proving their point. Interesting as the article may be, it shows merely that the 6 Akbash-type dogs in the kennel of Selcuk University are genetically less different from each other than from the 23 Kangal-type dogs in the same kennel (half of which cannot be differentiated from a sample of feral dogs, also from a single location). This research needed a much larger and more differentiated population.<br /></dd>
<dd>But what is needed even more is an analysis of what a dogbreed is, or should be. Now it almost seems the authors believe it is something with an objective existence, in the classic 'racist' sense. However, the differences between older breeds do not seem to be very 'fixed', and it is largely a matter of opinion where to draw the lines. In this case the FCI drew, some time ago, a 'wide line' including several varieties. More recently other parties want to draw the line somewhere else, thinking that makes more sense. So they differentiate between two breeds, which might also have been three or four, whatever.<br /></dd>
<dd>In the end, I suppose, the FCI will accept the Turkish proposals, because until now the country of origin always has had the last word. And so it should be. But it is not a matter of thruth, rather of convenience. In the meantime Wikipedia should try to make the nature of the debate clear. To help I will fill the 'see also's'.

<p>According to the UN-FAO, it's whatever the native people of a region name and describe as a breed. Breeds are valuable pools of genetic diversity--lump them together and you lose the very traits that make them valuable.</p>
<p>The "lumpers vs. splitters" debate is indeed a matter of both truth and convenience. The truth is that Turkey has developed several distinct breeds of livestock guardian dogs--call them landrace if you will--and these dogs fit particular geocultural niches in separate regions in which sheep herding has been the way of life for centuries. Elsewhere in Turkey, sheepherding is and has been spotty. Street dogs, including shepherd dog types, are and always have been ubiquitous in cities, towns, and villages where sheepherding is NOT the primary way of life.</p>
<p>The Anatolian Shepherd does not exist in Turkey, using any of the authoritative definitions of the term "breed." What breed of historic working dog spans an entire large nation, irrespective of region, ethic diversity, history? England has how many breeds of terriers? Hungary has several breeds of livestock guardians. The Anatolian is an amalgam created by British and American fanciers who brought dogs from various parts of Turkey and made up a name for them--for their convenience, and pride, and to add value to their dogs by registering them. In Turkey, they are all called "coban kopegi" of course, which simply means "shepherd's dog". It is a functional designation, not a breed name. Ask the Turks. Kangal Dogs are declared a national treasure and bred at government, military, and private facilities. The all-white Akbash Dogs are now very rare in Turkey and there is a concerted effort to save them there, along with the purebred Kangal Dog. Both breeds are declining due to the decline in the sheep industry, but that does not mean that they are not breeds.</p>
<p>Until recently, most Turks had no internet access, nor a sense of "dog culture" that we have in the West--they did not understand what westerners were doing to the future survival of their breed by lumping them all together under one name and getting major canine registries to give their stamp of approval. That is changing. The people of Sivas hold annual Kangal Festivals and academic symposia. There is research and organized preservation efforts underway. There is now a Turkish Kennel Club, and they have petitioned the FCI for recognition of the true native Turkish breeds.</p>
<p>By the way, it is nonsensical to consider "Karabash" to be a synonym of Anatolian Shepherd. Anatolians can be any color and coat length. Karabash means "black headed" and refers to the fawn, black-masked coloration of the Kangal Dog--which by the way, matches the color of the predominant sheep bred in the area, the Kangal Karaman sheep. All Kangal Dogs are "karabash" but not all karabash dogs are Kangal Dogs. The British nomenclature for the Kangal Dog adds confusion of course--some British breeders have been breeding purebred Kangal Dogs for decades but persist in calling them Karabash, despite the protests of the Turkish authorities on the breed. Plus, while they keep their breeding programs largely separate, they register their Kangals as Anatolians, ever since the British KC decided to lump all Turkish breeds together. Yes, it is confusing!</p>
<p>But in sum: a Kangal is a Kangal, because of history, not because of some piece of western paper. It is the national breed of Turkey. It originates in an isolated geographic and historic region of Turkey, developed along with its matching sheep to thrive in a particular environment. It's color is a visible trademark, but not the defining characteristic, any more than a Cleveland Bay horse is defined only by its color. Mismarks and untypey dogs occur with a frequency now that was not there even 10 years ago--because of increased urbanization and the introduction of outside dogs. But the Kangal Dog is a historic breed, and worthy of preservation.</p>
<p>As for where "other parties" want to draw the line--it's time for knowledgeable Turks to weigh in. It is hard to find any Turk who will agree with the "Anatolian lumpers" point of view, except perhaps a very few urban or disaffected people who have been "educated" away from the facts that should be obvious to anyone who visits the villages in the Sivas-Kangal region of Turkey.Beautdogs 00:00, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I saw a program on South African TV yesterday showing how these dogs are being used to protect livestock (sheep) against attacks by leopards. It is part of a leopard conservation program which aims at preserving the lives of leopards by dissuading them from attacking farmers' sheep (and thereby removing the major motivation for farmers to kill the leopards). If I can get some references I will supply them. <a href="../../../p/e/a/User%7EPeashy_b91c.html" title="User:Peashy">Peashy</a> 12:19, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I realize it's been quite a while since this was posted, <i>however</i>, my family breeds Anatolians and I have heard this as well, from a reputable and seasoned breeder. My folks have a great deal of literature on the breed, given that they raise them; I'll be sure to check through their library the next time I visit them. Hopefully I'll be able to produce that reference.&#160;:) <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamatoKameko_e588.html" title="User:HamatoKameko">HamatoKameko</a> 19:46, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
