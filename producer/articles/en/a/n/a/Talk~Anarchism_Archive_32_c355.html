<p>I am sorry, I don't know where I can write:-( I found one mistake - Kronstadt rebelion was at 1921, not 1918.</p>
<p>Hello -- I don't quite understand how to make the {{<a href="../../../e/d/i/Template%7EEditprotected_d7e4.html" title="Template:Editprotected">editprotected</a>}} template work. The first use of the word anarchy was not exactly Euripides. The Athenians kept a list engraved in stone of all of the archons (like consuls, with a term limit of one year) and would write "anarchia" instead of a name for the years in which they didn't select an archon.</p>

<p>Free software is not an example of open source, and vice versa. Open source is pratical, free software is ideological.</p>

<li>Free Software <i>can</i> be seen as a subset of open source: Using your words, Free Software is <i>both</i> practical and ideological, while Open Source is only practical.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Claims needing sources</span></h3>
<p>RJII, according to the <a href="http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568770/Anarchism.html" class="external text" title="http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568770/Anarchism.html" rel="nofollow">encyclopaedia article</a> you are citing, which is apparently written by Carl Levy, the schools of anarchist thought are: (A) Mutalism, (B) Anarcho-Communism, and (C) Anarcho-Individualism. Levy only states that anarcho-capitalism exists as a "reborn" modification of the less-radical individualism found in the United States. It is also unclear as to whether or not he equates anarcho-capitalism with libertarianism: <i>this tradition has been reborn and modified in the United States as anarcho-capitalism or libertarianism</i>. <a href="http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568770_2/Anarchism.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568770_2/Anarchism.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> This shows that anarcho-capitalism exists in the United States and was has roots in American individualism; it does not substantiate the various claims made in the article</p>
<ul>
<li>that anarcho-capitalism currently exists as 1 of 3 schools of anarchism, opposed to syndicalism and communism, as suggested in Hogeye's "Chart of influences";</li>
<li>that anarcho-capitalism is a school of anarchist thought, as suggested by Hogeye's edits in <a href="../../../a/n/a/Template%7EAnarchism_e86e.html" title="Template:Anarchism">the anarchism template</a>;</li>
<li>that individualist anarchism is also known as "liberal anarchism", as suggested by the heading of the subsection, or that they are in any way equivalent;</li>
<li>that anarcho-capitalism is the most salient and prevalent example of anarchism today, as is suggested by its highly conspicuous placement under the contemporary anarchism section as the first example of contemporary anarchism;</li>
<li>that anarcho-capitalism warrants more space and attention than all other examples of contemporary anarchism;</li>
<li>that anarcho-capitalism existed as early as the 18th and 19th century (the Levy article actually contradicts this);</li>
<li>that the voluntaryism advocated by Auberon Herbert in the 19th century was actually anarcho-capitalism;</li>
<li>etc. --AaronS 20:54, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Of course he's equating anarcho-capitalism with libertarianism. Anarcho-capitalism is pure libertarianism. And, he saying that anarcho-capitalism is a form of individualist anarchism --what I've always been saying. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 20:58, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>If anarchism is the same thing as <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-statism.html" title="Anti-statism">anti-statism</a>, then it should be possible to merge the two articles together. However, if you attempted that I'm sure you'd find consensus suggests otherwise. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 20:45, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

Statism doesn't mean anarchism except in the context of anarchist discussions. Statism in common parlance just means a lot of state interventionism. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 01:50, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Anarchism, as far as I understand it from various sources, is the opposition to aggression (or coercion) in favor of voluntary relations. Opposition to the State is merely a side effect of that more foundational position. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 20:48, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>According to the same dictionaries that you cite to claim that anarchism is nothing more than anti-statism, anarchism is not opposition to aggression, but authority and control. --AaronS 21:20, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If anarchism is defined as opposition to "authority" then Bakunin couldn't be an anarchist: "Does it follow that I reject all authority? Far from me such a thought...I bow before the authority of special men because it is imposed on me by my own reason. I am conscious of my own inability to grasp, in all its detail, and positive development, any very large portion of human knowledge. Therefore there is no fixed and constant authority, but a continual exchange of mutual, temporary, and, above all, <b>voluntary authority and subordination</b>." -Bakunin <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 04:25, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That is a chart of influence, and does not address which schools are contemporary. I think there are five major contemporary schools of thought: Generic socialist anarchism (Bakunin), anarcho-communism, anarcho-syndicalism, individualist (cost-price) anarchism, and anarcho-capitalism. Things like anarcha-feminism and eco-anarchism are not schools of thought, but applications of thought from one or more of the five schools regarding an issue. Things like post-left anarchism and small a anarchism are offshoots or critiques of the five majors. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 00:47, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline">Anarcho-capitalism is the most salient and prevalent example of anarchism today, as is suggested by its highly conspicuous placement under the contemporary anarchism section as the first example of contemporary anarchism</span></h4>
<p>Strawman. I have not suggested that anarcho-capitalism "is the most salient and prevalent example of anarchism today." I have merely included anarcho-capitalism in order of coinage, <i>after</i> anarcho-communism and anarcho-syndicalism have already been extensively discussed. The anarcho-capitalism section should come before e.g. a second anarcho-syndicalist section, and before the various issue-oriented flavors of anarchism and sundry offshoots.</p>
<p>I'd consider putting the anarcho-capitalism section in earlier, just after Proudhon, since Molinari published Production of Security in 1849 and Spencer's Social Statics came out about that time. So long as anarcho-capitalism is banished from history, it needs to be salient in contemporary trends. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 00:30, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Historian Ralph Raico asserts what that Jakob Mauvillon, Julius Faucher, and Gustave de Molinari "had come up with was a form of individualist anarchism, or, as it would be called today, anarcho-capitalism or market anarchism." (<i>Authentic German Liberalism of the 19th Century</i>) Raico is professor of European history at SUNY at Buffalo with a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago. I can already see it now, you're going to try to dismiss him because his personal philosophy is pro-capitalist, right? <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 21:27, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Raico's credentials are just fine. Why do you smear me? It's a misrepresentation of my position to say that I oppose all pro-capitalist scholars; I have stated the exact opposite on a number of occasions. This is the second time that I have had to correct you, so I am inclined to think that either (a) I'm not making myself clear or (b) you understand me and are still misrepresenting me, for whatever reason. For the third time: people's political beliefs don't matter. How other scholars view their work does. The essay that you cite was published by the Ludwig von Mises Institute (<a href="http://www.mises.org/story/1787" class="external text" title="http://www.mises.org/story/1787" rel="nofollow">source</a>).

<p>Also, Rothbard says Molinari's philosophy was anarcho-capitalism. Rothbard coined the term anarcho-capitalism and applied it to Molinari's philosophy. Therefore, it's indisputable that Molinari's philosophy was representative of anarcho-capitalism. The person who coined the term was free to define it however he wished.

<dd>Rothbard coined the term anarcho-capitalism; he is at liberty to define it.

<dd>Molinari promoted the same system that present anarcho-capitalists do today. All notable anarcho-capitalists believe this. The only way to contradict this is to show one belief Molinari held that diverged from present anarcho-capitalists. <b>No one has been able to do this</b> because it cannot be done. And yes, in the archives on this article, the Molinari article, and the anarcho-capitalism article, people have been asked for such an example, and yet have never been able to provide one. "It would shatter my worldview of anarcho-capitalism not being around in the 19th century" is not a valid reason to reject the Molinari-anarcho-capitalist connection. <a href="../../../m/r/v/User%7EMrVoluntarist_23fd.html" title="User:MrVoluntarist">MrVoluntarist</a> 04:08, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Madison and Hamilton drew their ideas from various other philosophers; does that make John Locke a republican? Does that make Montesquieu an American revolutionary? I could invent anarcho-slavism and claim that Frederick Douglass was the first anarcho-slavist. Does that make me right? Does that make Frederick Douglass an anarcho-slavist? Of course not. The only <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> way to approach this would be to say "According to Rothbard..." Rothbard clearly has a POV interest in making his philosophy appear as if it has deep roots. Most thinkers do. Does that mean that he is wrong? No. But is he right? That's not clear, either. It's his opinion, and that's all, really. --AaronS 01:31, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Rothbard didn't didn't just "draw ideas" from Molinari; he essentially said, hey, that system advocated by Molinari? That's what I want. Madison and Hamilton did nothing analagous. But hey, at least you don't try to brazenly get away with putting words in people's mouths, or claiming that critics of anarcho-capitalism are anarcho-capitalist, or anything like that -- that's the important thing. Rothbard <i>defined</i> anarcho-capitalism. Ergo, he is the person to ask about which views in the past matched his. Except it's not only Rothbard, but every notable anarcho-capitalist. It's interesting that you bring up NPOV, which says:</dd>
<dd><i>Many adherents of a religion will object to a critical historical treatment of their own faith, claiming that this somehow discriminates against their religious beliefs. They would prefer that the articles describe their faith as they see it, which is often from a non-historical perspective (e.g. the way things are is the way things have always been; any differences are from heretical sects that don't represent the real religion.) Their point of view must be mentioned, yet note that there is no contradiction. NPOV policy means that we say something like this: Many adherents of this faith believe X, which they believe that members of this group have always believed; however, due to the acceptance of some findings (say which) by modern historians and archaeologists (say which), other adherents (say which) of this faith now believe Z.</i></dd>
<dd>So, if people claim that past philosophers shared their view X, but the evidence shows they believed Y, <i>then</i> you have grounds for claiming that their beliefs were different. But you don't. No one knows of any policy Molinari supported had that diverged from that of present anarcho-capitalists, and yes they've tried. <a href="../../../m/r/v/User%7EMrVoluntarist_23fd.html" title="User:MrVoluntarist">MrVoluntarist</a> 01:49, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"<i>Herbert develops the Spencerian idea of equal freedom to its logically consistent anarcho-capitalist end</i>" -Hans-Hermann Hoppe (he's an anarcho-capitalist, so he should know). Also, Benjamin Tucker admonishes Herbert for accepting interest, rents, and profit: "<i>Mr. Herbert proved beyond question that the government of man by man is utterly without justification, but is quite ignorant of the fact that interest, rent, and profits will find no place in the perfect economic order.</i>" Nevertheless, he still considers him an anarchist: "<i>Auberon Herbert is dead. He was a true anarchist in everything but name. How much better (and how much rarer) to be an anarchist in everything but name than to be an anarchist in name only!</i>" Anarcho-capitalism is anti-statism that accepts interest, rent, and profits as non-exploitative. So, here we see not only that Herbert is an anarcho-capitalist, but that Tucker holds that a philosophy that accepts interest, rent, and profit is consistent with anarchism. (Tucker, like <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Carson_3c69.html" title="Kevin Carson">Kevin Carson</a> today, thought that anarcho-capitalism collapses into labor-value individualism --that in laissez-faire, profit would not be possible due to increased competition). <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 05:24, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline">Additional examples of anarcho-capitalism being recognized as a form of anarchism</span></h4>
<p>This one is from a book called <i>Anti-Capitalism: A Beginner's Guide</i> by Simon Tormey (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1851683429</a>) . Not only does it hold anarcho-capitalism as a form of anarchism, but holds it as a form of individualist anarchism: "‘anarchism’ is essentially an umbrella term sheltering a staggeringly diverse range of political currents and groups.Indeed, to call oneself an ‘anarchist’ is to say very little of interest about oneself at all...One immediately needs to say what kind of anarchist, and in particular whether one is a collectivist or communist anarchist or an individualist or libertarian anarchist...Those who follow the lead of classical American anarchist thinkers of the nineteenth century such as Benjamin Tucker, Lysander Spooner or Josiah Warren would probably find themselves sympathising with those inside the conference centre at the meetings of the WTO or World Bank defending capitalism against the attacks of the anti-capitalists outside... Indeed some of the more prominent American (libertarian) anarchists would no doubt argue that there is too much intervention in the world rather than not enough...Pro-capitalist anarchism is, as one might expect, particularly prevalent in the US where it feeds on the strong individualist and libertarian currents that have always been a part of the American political imaginary. To return to the point, however, there are individualist anarchists who are most certainly not anti-capitalist and there are those who may well be." <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 02:31, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Political historian Carl Levy, in his article in the Encarta Encyclopedia (UK version) says: "The American Benjamin Tucker (1854-1939) believed that maximum individual liberty would be assured where the free market was not hindered or controlled by the State and monopolies. The affairs of society would be governed by myriad voluntary societies and cooperatives, by, as he aptly put it, “un-terrified” Jeffersonian democrats, who believed in the least government possible. Since World War II this tradition has been reborn and modified in the United States as anaocho-capitalism or libertarianism." <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 02:40, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>RJIII, I value the work you've put in to this article, even though we strongly disagree on political points, and I abhorr the editorial process which has been used to achieve the current article's state. As someone who has not edited <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a> seriously for twelve months or more due to the editorial climate, I'd like to suggest points for a resolution on the position of anarcho-capitalism within this article to you, as I believe you to be honestly interested in the article's worth. I think that for perhaps the last six to eight months the position that individualist pro-market anarchism may be considered an inheritor of 19th century anarchism has been set beyond nay saying by all but the most polemically involved anti-capitalist. The remaining points of contention are three:
<ol>
<li>Contemporary "Anarcho-capitalism", a child of mid 20th century US-market "Libertarianism" as a "Liberalism reaffirmed", or a child of 19th century US individualist market mutualism? The former is readily notable, the latter is much, much more contingent. The latter also involves a conflation of US market-mutualism/individualism with international individualism. Outside of the US, individualism was a much more secular, atheist, "humanist society" style humanism and rationalist domain; generally not making statements regarding economics, and when doing so, generally in favour of the socialism enunciated by their communist bretheren. This could be corrected through better editing of the current article, combined with more research on non-US individualism/mutualism.</li>
<li>Geographic bias. Anarcho-capitalism is a miniscule phenomena within is homeland (the US), where it functions as an internal faction within a comparatively small fundamentally liberal (as in 19th century liberalism) movement. The extent to which some editors attempt to feature anarcho-capitalism on this page as a <i>universal</i> trend within anarchism is a problem generating bias. This could be corrected through better article editing, deprioritising the importance of anarcho-capitalism outside of the context of US political movements.</li>
<li>Emphasis bias. Anarcho-capitalism, using geographic (restricted as an indigenous current to NA), raw adherent numbers (low compared to non-AC individualists, lets alone socialists), liniage (a branch of mutualist-individualism), theoretical difference (a not particularly dynamically different branch), general public social consciousness (much much lower internationally compared to the socialist varities) or length of organised formal tendencies (max late 1960s as a theoretical movement, as a social movement late 1990s) is not as significant as it is portrayed to be in the current article. In comparison it is not fundamentally different from mutualism, as, for example, syndicalism is from pre-syndicalist utopian-socialist anarchisms is.</li>

<dd>My suggestion is that anarcho-capitalism should be addressed as an issue scoping the limits of anarchism in practice, be summarised in any discussion of trends or tendencies, but that the general article note early that there are some highly divergent strains, and address the issue of anarchism (in this article) from the perspective of the overwhelming majority of anarchist strains, and anarchist conceptions: those which are anti-capitalist. I am not suggesting here that an anarcho-syndicalist -communist or -ecologist position should override such minority anti-capitalist positions as non-market mutualism and individualism, or christian anarchism, Western lifestylism etc., but rather that the shared (and fairly minimalist) anti-capitalist position shared by these tendencies should be the basis of describing shared political views. This is of course my position, and I am raising it with you because you seem to coherently present an editorial position wildly different to my own.</dd>
<dd>The work which (in my opinion) you have put into researching this RJIII is admirable. The article currently isn't. Anarcho-capitalism is not central to a discussion of anarchism in the abstract, rather it is a minor side point, more influential than Christian anarchism, but less significant than ecological anarchism. <a href="../../../f/i/f/User%7EFifelfoo_12d0.html" title="User:Fifelfoo">Fifelfoo</a> 03:54, 12 January 2006 (UTC) (And I forgot to sign it).

<dd>Tolstoyanism (which many describe as a form of Christian anarchism) was actually a fairly substantial movement around the start of the 20th century - unfortunately now pretty well lost in the mists of history.

<li>I think the intro should make it clear that <i>any philosophy which holds the state to be an unnecessary evil</i> is a form of anarchism, regardless of economic preference.

<li>here are clear differences between the grandiose claims made about anarchism as an abstract concept and the reality of anarchism as a social movement. I.e. if anarchism is about teh rejection of all forms of authority and oppression, then clearly such racists and msygonists as Proudhon and Bakunin have to be removed. However like other social political and religious movements, anarchism suffers from similar defects as all the others - so perhaps a more balanced NPOV way of writing that touches on Proudhon's sexism - which was relevant at the time rather than the constant removal of any references to this - which ends up with the same school of historical falsification that the <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolsheviks.html" title="Bolsheviks">bolsheviks</a> have used to hide such phenomena as <a href="../../../k/r/o/Kronstadt.html" title="Kronstadt">Kronstadt</a>. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarrypotter_9204.html" title="User:Harrypotter">Harrypotter</a> 22:46, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Like anarchism, liberalism stemmed from the concern for freedom, and the wish to keep the activities of the state and the functions of government to a minimum. Anarchism, however, holds that liberal postulates are realizable only on the basis of the abolition of economic monopoly and the coercive institutions of political power because, while equality is quite possible without liberty, there can be no liberty without social and economic equality; “liberty without socialism is privilege, injustice; and socialism without liberty is slavery and brutality” (Bakunin).</p>

<p>"As such, anarcho-capitalism overlooks the egalitarian implications of traditional individualist anarchists like Spooner and Tucker. In fact, few anarchists would accept 'anarcho-capitalists' into the anarchist camp since they do not share a concern for economic equality and social justice. Their self-interested, calculating market men would be incapable of practising voluntary co-operation and mutual aid. Anarcho-capitalists, even if they do reject the State, might therefore best be called right-wing libertarians rather than anarchists.[15]" "Demanding the Impossible: A History of Anarchism" by Peter Marshall, chap 36. <a href="http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/dward/newrightanarchocap.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/dward/newrightanarchocap.html" rel="nofollow">[19]</a></p>

"‘anarchism’ is essentially an umbrella term sheltering a staggeringly diverse range of political currents and groups.Indeed, to call oneself an ‘anarchist’ is to say very little of interest about oneself at all...One immediately needs to say what kind of anarchist, and in particular whether one is a collectivist or communist anarchist or an individualist or libertarian anarchist...Those who follow the lead of classical American anarchist thinkers of the nineteenth century such as Benjamin Tucker, Lysander Spooner or Josiah Warren would probably find themselves sympathising with those inside the conference centre at the meetings of the WTO or World Bank defending capitalism against the attacks of the anti-capitalists outside... Indeed some of the more prominent American (libertarian) anarchists would no doubt argue that there is too much intervention in the world rather than not enough...Pro-capitalist anarchism is, as one might expect, particularly prevalent in the US where it feeds on the strong individualist and libertarian currents that have always been a part of the American political imaginary. To return to the point, however, there are individualist anarchists who are most certainly not anti-capitalist and there are those who may well be." RJII 02:31, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Benjamin Tucker on Auberon Herbert: "Mr. Herbert proved beyond question that the government of man by man is utterly without justification, but is quite ignorant of the fact that interest, rent, and profits will find no place in the perfect economic order." Nevertheless, he still considers him an anarchist: "Auberon Herbert is dead. He was a true anarchist in everything but name. How much better (and how much rarer) to be an anarchist in everything but name than to be an anarchist in name only!" RJII</li>

<li><i>Anarchism: Left, Right and Green</i> by Ulrike Heider (<i>San Francisco: City Lights Books, 1994</i>). Heider says that there are three broad categories of anarchism: Left anarchism is anarcho-syndicalism and communism, Anarcho-capitalism is right anarchism, and then there's Green anarchism. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 05:04, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

I find some of the differences interesting between the English version of this article and the German one, which for instance has a list of "Other, newer or partially disputed forms of anarchism" which includes right libertarianism, anarcho-capitalism, anarcha-feminism, post-anarchism, "situationism" [sic], and "pogo-anarchism" (see <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchist_Pogo_Party_of_Germany_eb11.html" title="Anarchist Pogo Party of Germany">Anarchist Pogo Party of Germany</a>).

<p>That's only based on your broad definition of anarchism. Since you claim that anarchism is mere anti-statism, then all different "schools" of anarchist thought are possible -- anarcho-rapism, anarcho-racism, anarcho-slavism, etc. -- that no respectable scholar would ever actually call anarchist. This is the reason why I have been asking for sources. If you can find me a reliable source that says that national anarchism is a school of anarchist thought, then, by all means, we should definitely include it.

<p>Rothbard sounds very much like an anarchist: e.g. Proudhon: in Cesarisme et Christianisme Proudhon states: "The Jew is by temperament an anti-producer, neither a farmer nor an industrial nor even a true merchant. He is an intermediary, always fraudulent and parasitic, who operates, in trade as in philosophy, by means of falsification, counterfeiting, horse-dealing. He knows but the rise and fall of prices, the risk of transport, the incertitude of crops, the hazard of demand and supply. His policy in economics has always been entirely negative, entirely usurious; it is the evil principle, Satan, Ahriman, incarnated in the race of Sem." Proudhon's sexism was also a significant issue during his life time. . . . and then of course there is Bakkkunin's anti-semitism too . <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarrypotter_9204.html" title="User:Harrypotter">Harrypotter</a> 01:58, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not sure, but it seems like Spooner should be in there. Rothbard bases his anarchism in natural law, and Tucker was primarily an egoist. Spooner is natural law. It's possible he was influenced by Spooner on this, but I'm not sure. Here's something by Rothbard about Spooner: <a href="http://www.mises.org/rothbardintros/spooner.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mises.org/rothbardintros/spooner.asp" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 03:11, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Here you go. McElroy says Rothbard "fused together...the radical civil libertarianism of 19th century individualist-anarchists, especially Lysander Spooner and Benjamin Tucker." <a href="http://www.zetetics.com/mac/rockwell/mcelroy000706.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.zetetics.com/mac/rockwell/mcelroy000706.html" rel="nofollow">[30]</a> I would guess he would be on the line there between mutualism and capitalism, but not sure. Also, note that he developed in isolation from the other individualist anarchist until late in life when he wrote his most radical anti-government texts. I'm not sure how much he influenced Tucker, though Tucker did speak well of him; also I'm not sure how much the Tucker school influenced him either ..I would guess it wasn't a huge influence, but it may have been responsible for his writings getting a more explicitly anarchist. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 03:17, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Right. I basically put in a representative person from each school. There's no way I can put everyone in there! Perhaps there should be some indication of the classical liberal influence, e.g. JLocke-TPaine/TJefferson-HSpencer-AHerbert. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 18:30, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm concerned that this is, fundamentally, a "Great Man" theory of anarchist ideological development. That's an untenable bias. Early socialist anarchisms developed out of bourgeois and petit-bourgeois radicalism (just as much as social democracy prior to the twentieth century). Rocker's syndicalism is insignificant when compared to syndicalist and industrial unionist <i>practice</i> as a class practice in society. Or, for example, compare pre-20th century liberalist market anarchisms with the development of the free-silver, populist and progressive movements in the US, or the much later Douglas Social Credit movement. Connection to concrete social reality is far more important than individual thinkers. <a href="../../../f/i/f/User%7EFifelfoo_12d0.html" title="User:Fifelfoo">Fifelfoo</a> 03:54, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Right; this should not be interpreted as a Great Man theory. The people named are simply representative of their school. Choosing a representative anarcho-syndicalist is not easy; unlike some other schools there doesn't seem to be a <i>main man</i>.</dd>
<dd>I don't quite get the connection between individualist anarchism and bi-metalism or progressivism. As far as I know, they opposed central government price-fixing a gold/silver ratio, and also opposed prohibitionism and govt control of schools, the main gist of 19th century progressivism.</dd>
<dd>I think we need to separate, conceptually if not in the article, anarchism qua philosophy and anarchism qua movement. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 18:30, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Bi-metalism and progressivism were small farmer and small storeowner responses to the gilded age of gross individual capitalist monopolists. They were class movements of the petit-bourgeois for libertarian social change: they identified large government as their key social problem, and secondly, monopoly as encouraged by large government. In comparison to individualist theorists, bi-metalism, popularism and progressivism all represent a social movement for market libertarianism in the United States. Trying to pick an "individual" who apparently represents syndicalism is hard, because syndicalism isn't a bourgeois movement founded by a bourgeois or aristocratic intellectual (ie Kropotkin's "communism"); its an actual movement by working people for social change.</dd>
<dd>If it turns out that the main reason why there's been prominance and "inclusion" arguments over anarcho-capitalism is that anarcho-capitalists view themselves as a theoretical position only (as opposed to a praxis), and we've wasted a year over a fundamental catagory misunderstanding, I am going to spew. Anyway, if that's the result then we should more clearly delinate anarchisms, and turn the anarchism page into a disambig.<a href="../../../f/i/f/User%7EFifelfoo_12d0.html" title="User:Fifelfoo">Fifelfoo</a> 22:26, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just wanted to share some thoughts I had after reading this page.</p>
<ol>
<li>It is futile and inappropriate on the talk page to argue, "If anarchism is defined a certain way, than X is/is not a form of anarchism." Our job is not to <i>classify</i> anything; our job is simply to present the relevant data we have. We have sources that define anarchism; let us summarize those and present them. We have sources that attempt to classify the various "schools" of anarchism; let us summarize those sources and present them, <i>even if the sources disagree with each other!</i> Our job is not to settle disagreements between sources; rather, our job is to explain the disagreements as elegantly as we can. As a concrete example, we have a source that says Rothbard claimed the philosophy of Molinari was anarcho-capitalism. So, under the anarcho-capitalist section, let us simply write "Rothbard, an anarcho-capitalist, claimed the philosophy of Molinari was anarcho-capitalism." It is without question that Rothbard is a notable person, so just let the reader decide if Rothbard's claim is valid or not.</li>
<li>Let us all remember to be constructive, rather than destructive. RJII has done a great job of presenting a lot of sources, and I encourage his opponents to do the same, because that is exactly what we need. Once a source is presented, we should not hastily dismiss it, or demand more sources before we accept it. Sources help us build the page, so we should not dismiss a source unless we either 1) have many better sources on the same subject or 2) the source completely lacks credibility. I completely disagree with AaronS's remark that "credentials aren't entirely important". If someone has a Ph.D., than I think their opinion is definitely something we should include on this page, especially when we don't have many sources to choose from. A Ph.D. does not prove they are right, but their opinion is certainly notable.</li>
<li>"Connection to concrete social reality is far more important than individual thinkers." Why weigh the two against each other? Just make "thought" and "movement" separate subjects. The "thought" section is basically defined by academics and Great Men, so let the weight of each section be roughly proportional to the school's influence in academic circles. For the "movement" section, simply discuss the most significant anarchist movements in history. If most or all of the movements have people that belong to a certain school, it will be clear enough to the reader which theories are truly practiced.</li>
<li>I think Hogeye's anarchism tree is impressive, and is the kind of thing that would really make this article stand out. If everything the diagram implies can basically be cited (and I'm not saying it can or can't be), than I would love to see it in the article. I think we need to stop arguing about what anarchism is or isn't, and focus instead on how we can present all of the cited information we have. If we do that, than I believe the article we will have in the end will be something that the entire Wikipedia community can respect and learn from.</li>
</ol>
<p>Just my two cents. -- Blah99 06:01, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think you are right about points two and three; RJ's citations are great, and we <i>do</i> need to keep in mind the distinction between anarchist thought and anarchist movements. I agree with much of point one. In fact, we used to have an intro that specifically noted the broad range of interpretations of "authority," ranging from <i>simple anti-statism</i> to <i>opposition to all hierarchy no matter how consentual</i>. But point one begs the questions of whether 1) anarcho-capitalism should be in the template and 2) have a section 'equal' to anarcho-syndicalism. The implication is that you favor "yes" to both, while arguing definitions in the sectarian sections. I agree. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 16:53, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that's a good point to recognize the difference between a social and a philosophical movement. It's an apples and oranges comparison to try to compaire the extent of a social movement to the extent of a philosophical movement (anarchism is comprised of both). I would guess a philosophical movement would have a larger effect on how society structures itself, though. So, even if a philosophical movement was comprised of, say, 5 people, it could have a larger impact on the world than 5000 people marching in the street. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 20:16, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We are no longer arguing that anarcho-capitalism is not anarchism, or that it should not be in the page--the real disagreement is how much promininence and importance it should have. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force">The Ungovernable Force</a> 06:14, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This table is original research, highly POV, and has no place in the article. Ungovernable Force - I certainly continue to argue that anarcho-capitalism is not anarchism, as many editors of this page have done. For RJ to demonstrate that anarcho-capitalism should be included would take, to my mind, him showing that a large number of reputable sources consider it to be part of the anarchist movement. Even then, it would have to be made clear that its place is disputed by many others.
<dl>
<dd>Although I personally consider An-cap to be a complete perversion of anarchist thought (just like national anarchism as mentioned above), it does seem as if an-cap developed from Individualist anarchism and thus merits a <i>small</i> discussion confined completely to the individualist section, w/o a section of it's own. And I have seen and even sourced comments by Chomsky supporting that an-cap developed from and can be viewed as a form of individualist anarchism, while then going on to say it is a completely insane idea and will only be private tyranny. Still, I think it deserves brief mention, which should clearly state the opposition it encounters from anti-cap anarchists (including myself) and the fact that there is no viable movement connected to it. Basically it's just armchair philosophy. I think it's a fair compromise. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force">The Ungovernable Force</a> 04:15, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are plenty of sources to show that anarchism has been, and remains, opposed to capitalism. We began setting them out above as requested by the mediator - I have reinstated that work which was lost by hasty archiving. For these to be overturned and anarchism to be redefined to include capitalism would take a major swing in the way people use the term anarchism. This is not demonstrated by eg. one encyclopedist writing that anarcho-capitalism is a modification of American individualism.<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBengalski_c6f3.html" title="User:Bengalski">Bengalski</a> 10:09, 12 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Opposition to capitalism and opposition to anarcho-capitalism are two different things, especially if you're talking in an historical sense. Capitalism did not have the same definition that it has today. See old dictionaries for evidence of that. It was not even defined as an <i>economic system'</i>, but as a state of affairs --the concentration of capital in the hands of a few, or simply the ownership of capital (something no individualist anarchist opposes). The old labor-value individualist anarchists defined capitalism in terms of government-backed privilege for capital such as the banking monopoly, so in that sense anarcho-capitalists also oppose capitalism.<a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 16:19, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am copying RJ's sources arguing notability of ancapism as a form of anarchism into the appropriate part of the mediation discussion. If people are still serious about trying to go on with mediation I suggest we discuss them there, and add more sources for discussion. I can put more in over next couple of days - a lot of them may be Spanish however as I don't have much access to English books. What I think would be useful is if someone can get citations from the main English language histories of anarchism. On the other hand, if there is no desire from anyone else to go on with the process started by the mediator say so and I'll give up now.<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBengalski_c6f3.html" title="User:Bengalski">Bengalski</a></dd>

<p><i>Pour l'ensemble des socialistes libertaires, les courants tels que le national-anarchisme, l'anarcho-capitalisme et l'anarchisme de droite sont rejetés, considérant que les idées de ces mouvements sont extérieures à l'anarchisme politique et historique, et qu'elles n'ont aucun point commun avec les leurs et leur sont même fondamentalement opposées.

<p>The historical anarchist tendencies (socialist/syndicalist/proudhonian/communist/individualist/stirnerien anarchism) are equally the most active politically and ideologically and the most organised. They have a very rich historical heritage and are composed through the decades by a large amount of militant and activist behaviour. They constitute even today the hard core of active anarchism and the majority of anarchists consider that these are the only movements that can legitimately be called anarchism.</p>
<p>In the vein of the anarchist movement, other non-traditional movements are more or less well known (than the previous tendencies), some consider that they enrich anarchism, others not.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the diverse tendencies reject each other mutually, the libertarian individualists can reject the socialists and vice-versa.</p>
<p>For the libertarian socialists, the currents of national-anarchism, anarcho-capitalism and right-anarchism are rejected, considering that the ideas of these movements are exterior to anarchism, historically and politically. They have no common points with them and they are fundamentally opposed. Most of them consider they are abusively using the term "anarchism". The anarcho-capitalists reject equally national-anarchism and right-anarchism.</p>

<dd>This table seems that uses a totally right-wing definition, or maybe american of socialism. It isn't neutral. Individual anarchism is a form of socialism.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That's absurd. This table is the most useful, succinct summation of the arguments here, and resolves them nicely. Individualist anarchism, at least in an American context, does support the general tenets of contract libertarianism. In one essay (I forget the name) Voltarine DeCleyre argues that people through their private industry have done more for society than government has. There's an obvious tinge of anarcho-capitalism there. However, it's also legit to say that DeCleyre was opposed to profit ("the much making of things," in her words). Thus, cost was the limit of price for this anti-government individualist! Thanks for chart. It's excellent . . . and, yes, there should be a disambiguation page for this entry. At the same time, what we should all do is take a look at the collection of Goldman's Mother Earth and see the broad definitions of Anarchism that even the self-proclaimed Anarchist Communist editors of that magazine could accept. They slide between individualist anarchist and libertarian socialist. Arguably, though, any consistent anarchist system based on anarchism (market or otherwise) ought to be opposed to profit in other words to price above the value of labor. The best argument for anarchist capitalism, at least in an American context--Benjamin Tucker--firmly belived that the cost of labor should be the price of a product. I.e., no profits! I would challenge the person who put up this chart to come up with an Anarchist in the history of the movement who supports free trade and what we used to call usury. That said, in teaching anarchism in American history next semester, I can't not include Libertarianism. But I guess I'm leaning toward post Left Anarchism.</dd>

<dd>That depends on how you define anarchism. If you use the etymological/dictionary definition, it's easy: Gustav de Molinari, Murray Rothbard, David Friedman, Hans-Herman Hoppe are some of the most famous. If you use the (unsatisfactory IMO) <i>whoever called themselves "anarchist" before Rothbard</i>, then I know of no one. If you loosen that just a little to <i>those considered anarchist by uncontested anarchist authorities</i>, there's Auberon Herbert.

Nevertheless, he still considers him an anarchist: "Auberon Herbert is dead. He was a true anarchist in everything but name.

<dd>In English, a <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialism.html" title="Socialism">socialism</a> has "the core belief that society should exist in which popular collectives control the means of power." IOW they believe in collective ownership. If you are a socialist (using the modern definition), then you are not an individualist, who believes in private ownership. Note that in the 19th century "socialism" was defined differently - as "cost is the limit of price" rather than in terms of collective ownership. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 15:14, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I'm not a capitalist or state socialist, I'm an anarchist, so I don't use capitalists or state socialist definitions of socialism, I use an anarchist definition of socialism and individual property is compatible with an anarchist definition of socialism.</dd>

<dd>Another thing. By a socialist anarchist (and individualist) european as me, as me, _private_ property is capitalist propierty (in my terminology, bourgeois propierty privileged by the State), and _property_ is individual or collective (e.g. a co-op ownership) workers property. You are using an american (USA) right-wing libertarian therminology, but this right-wing therminology, IMHO, is not the Standard, is only an arbitrary teerminology used by right-wing people. Tucker (and all libertarian socialist anarchists) used the same terminology as me.</dd>

<dd>83's got a good point. In particular with regards to Proudhon, and the terminology coming from him: RJ and Hogeye's versions of Proudhon are based on reading 'possession' = 'private property'. They then dismisss Proudhon's <i>propriete</i>, the concept he devotes a whole book to attacking, as some strange antiquated notion of no relevance to anything. But even without looking at the texts in any detail, there is a major stumbling block for this reading. RJ and Hogeye claim that Proudhon supported 'private property' for capital and consumption goods, but not 'natural resources'. This is just plain wrong: Proudhon did allow 'possession' of natural resources. Therefore, if 'possession' = 'private property', Proudhon supported private property of everything, including land and other natural resources. Of course, the truth is 'possession' does not mean 'private property'.<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBengalski_c6f3.html" title="User:Bengalski">Bengalski</a> 13:03, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think we need to define some terms.</p>
<ul>
<li>property - rights related to the use of a thing</li>
<li>private property - property which can be owned by an individual</li>
<li>sticky property - property that can be transferred only by consent of the owner (or abandonment)</li>
<li>possession property - property that is considered abandoned and unowned when the current owner quits use/occupancy</li>
<li>collectivism - the belief that all property should be collectively owned (usually by certain groups) rather than private property</li>
<li>Tucker ('weak') socialism - anti-collectivist (for private property) but against making a profit without personal labor (usury).</li>
<li>modern ('strong') socialism - collectivism <i>and</i> against against making a profit without personal labor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using these definitions: Tucker, Jefferson, and Proudhon believed that land (or any natural resource) was possession property and all other property was sticky property. They believed that <i>both</i> could legitimately be held as private property. None of these guys are "collectivist." Of these, Tucker and Proudhon were against making a profit without personal labor. In modern terminology, Tucker and Proudhon were <i>not</i> socialist, and both favored private property over collectivism. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 16:17, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is specious Hogeye, you're engaged in solipsistic catagorisation. What's worse than the mere inadequacy of your catagorisation: the catagories arising not naturally from the subject; is that your catagories are designed to push a particular view. Given that catagorisation schema are a central part of academic disciplinary practice, I'd suggest you find a peer reviewed journal article or monograph by a PhD in a politics related humanity to back up that schema. One might as well say that there are seven varieties of anarchism: those that are, those that are not, those which are blue on tuesdays, those which defy the pope, those which number less than four, those which are smaller than a large dog and those which exist only as wikipedia articles. <a href="../../../f/i/f/User%7EFifelfoo_12d0.html" title="User:Fifelfoo">Fifelfoo</a> 01:37, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I suspect just a few here (Bengalski, RJII...) will understand how critical those particular questions about property and labor-value are. (See the discussions about mutualism in the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Individualist_anarchist.html" title="Individualist anarchist">Individualist anarchist</a> talk pages.) The classic academic categorization is collectivist vs individualist. It would be nice to account for the newer forms, like anarcho-capitalism and green anarchism. Eco-anarchism borrows a lot from Georgism, you know.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Your second criticism is puzzling. The categories are not meaningless "blue on tuesday" descriptions, but <i>actual well-known schools of anarchism</i>. So your implication <i>that my categories are frivolous</i> is without merit, as is the claim that <i>the catagories don't arise naturally from the subject.</i> In fact, they do. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 03:50, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No mate, they don't naturally arise out of anarchist practice, they're meaningless in terms of describing anti-market anarchisms. I think you're also subsuming all forms of environmental anarchism under one very small branch. "Cost the limit of price?" is an obscurity to the majority of anarchist thought and movements. "Natural resources as private property?" is a subsumption of a much larger debate. If we're going to do scalar tables on the basis of theory, we might start looking at what arises from the nature of each subject, and the nature of their difference:
<ol>
<li>Theory of value or price? Marxian LTV, Other LTV, Heterodoxy, Irrelevent, Classical demand price theories, Heterodox demand price theories</li>
<li>Domain of action? Workerist social revolution, Non-workerist social revolution, social ecology change, culture reform, lifestyle, propaganda, theory only</li>
<li>Analytical tool set? Historical Materialist, post-modernist, etc.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>By declaring a scale which is utterly irrelevent to (off the top) Lib socs, Christians &amp; Pacificists, left individualists, lifestylists and most of the greens you're introducing a POV bias. Its also clearly original research.</dd>
<dd>Most greens which I know, incidentally, come out of a clear and obvious LTV / social democrat background, this appears to be true in Au and NZ universally. They're busy producing a bunch of heterodox political economies to account for the scarcity of environmental resources. <a href="../../../f/i/f/User%7EFifelfoo_12d0.html" title="User:Fifelfoo">Fifelfoo</a> 04:24, 13 January 2006 (UTC)

<p><i>Fifelfoo&gt; "Cost the limit of price?" is an obscurity to the majority of anarchist thought and movements."</i></p>
<p>Right - you need to translate the question into the correct jargon. For many, it will be, "Do you believe in the labor theory of value?," or, "Do you believe that wage-labor is exploitative?"</p>
<p><i>Fifelfoo&gt; "We might start looking at what arises from the nature of each subject, and the nature of their difference: 1. Theory of value or price? Marxian LTV, Other LTV, Heterodoxy, Irrelevent, Classical demand price theories, Heterodox demand price theories"</i></p>
<p>Right. I divided these into two basic types: LTV-supporters and LTV-deniers (aka <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marginalism.html" title="Marginalism">marginalists</a>.) This separates the socialists from the capitalists. As the second dimension, I took another critical economic position - the property status of natural resources. This separates the individualists from the collectivists.</p>
<p>You are correct that I selected economic questions, rather than domain of action or analytical framing. You are right that this doesn't address issue-oriented sects or weird offshoots, nor does it make fine distinctions among the many collectivist + LTV schools. (All those commies look about the same to me.&#160;;-) What the model <i>does</i> do is expand on the old (individualist, collectivist) division, providing a logical justification for the (libertarian socialist, individualist anarchist, anarcho-capitalist) divisions we've been using, with the bonus of pointing to anarcho-Georgism as the lesser-known (perhaps surprising) fourth category.</p>
<p>I agree that most green anarchists are libertarian socialist rather than geoanarchist. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 05:19, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As I've said a million times, value theory is just no way near as important to anarchism as you and RJ keep on about. Yes I see that American individualists like Tucker put some kind of LTV (this is such a misunderstood topic) at the core of their philosophy, but they were the only ones. Proudhon has a form of LTV in WIP, but it only appears in one section - it is by no means definitional for him. And Kropotkin is dismissive of LTV or even actually against it. Eg see 'Conquest of Bread'(chap 3):</p>
<p>"Looking at production from this general, synthetic point of view, we cannot hold with the Collectivists that payment proportionate to the hours of labour rendered by each would be an ideal arrangement, or even a step in the right direction. Without discussing whether exchange value of goods is really measured in existing societies by the amount of work necessary to produce it--according to the doctrine of Smith and Ricardo, in whose footsteps Marx has followed--suffice it to say here, leaving ourselves free to return to the subject later, that the Collectivist ideal appears to us untenable in a society which considers the instruments of labour as a common inheritance."</p>
<p>Note there that Kropotkin is one writer who's able to distinguish 'cost limit of price' normative theories from 'positive' theories of how goods actually exchange 'in existing societies'. And when he does return to look more at LTV he goes against the latter also as a foundation of exploitation theory, concluding:</p>
<p>"The evil of the present system is therefore not that the "surplus-value" of production goes to the capitalist, as Rodbertus and Marx said, thus narrowing the Socialist conception and the general view of the capitalist system; the surplus-value itself is but a consequence of deeper causes." etc. (Hey - another mention of 'capitalist system' which wasn't supposed to exist in those days.)</p>
<p>And in chap 14 he starts up a virtually marginalist critique of Marx and the classicals for ignoring consumption.

<dd>Good point, Bengalski! I hadn't realized how sophisticated Kropotkin was wrt economics. As you note, he even had a subjective theory of value!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>The theories of value that economists have endeavored to base, from Adam Smith to Marx, only on the cost of production, valued in labor time, have not solved the question of value. As soon as there is exchange, the value of an article becomes a complex quantity, and depends also on the degree of satisfaction which it brings to the needs-not of the individual, as certain economists stated formerly, but of the whole of society, taken in its entirety. Value is a social fact. Being the result of an exchange, it has a double aspect: that of labor, and that of satisfaction of needs, both evidently conceived in their social and not individual aspect. - <a href="http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/kropotkin/philandideal.html" class="external text" title="http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/kropotkin/philandideal.html" rel="nofollow">Peter Kropotkin, "Anarchism: Its philosophy and ideal."</a></p>
</blockquote>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>He was head and shoulders above most other anarcho-socialist theorists (e.g. Bakunin) in economic theory.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You've convinced me that Kropotkin's (and Bakunin's<a href="http://anarchism.jesusradicals.com/library/bakunin/system.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://anarchism.jesusradicals.com/library/bakunin/system.html" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>) exploitation theory was based on <i>unequal bargaining positions</i> rather than the labor theory of value - the old <i>starving worker</i> rationale. This is probably a weaker basis for the exploitation claim than the Marxian LTV, since the argument apparently depends on two premises: that wages will always approach starvation level, and that unemployment levels remain high. Both these assumptions have failed to apply in modern liberal capitalist societies. (One can understand how K. and B. would think so, since they lived during the industrial revolution with booming population.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So I agree, the column question needs tweaking. Perhaps: "Is profiting from others' labor exploitative?" Or, "Only labor deserves compensation." What do you think? <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 18:46, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What I think is this would be an interesting discussion to have on the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchist_economics.html" title="Anarchist economics">anarchist economics</a> page, which needs of a lot of work. Though even there I think your 2x2 table is a big oversimplification of the range of views. Here it is completely out of place - you are trying to categorise anarchist thought around two economic dimensions that weren't central to many of the thinkers. I can see where this is coming from - as RJ says, these ideas were central to the American individualist tradition you are most familiar with, and so you are using them as a lens through which you look at everyone else. That may be a natural way to proceed when you're doing your own personal research, but it is original research and you should hold back from putting it straight into the article.</dd>

<dd>Yes I think Kropotkin's view of exploitation was based more on a 'bargaining theory' than a 'value theory'; I'm not sure if Bakunin has a consistent position on this - he says things along those lines, but also is very praising of Marx's economics (before they fell out). And yes they took the worker's initial bargaining position to be near-starvation and unemployment. But I think that kind of theory would still hold together though, and still give you an account of exploitation, without assuming starvation if the worker rejects the deal. We still have gross inequalities and unequal bargaining in contemporary capitalism, even in countries where starvation is less likely today. (Though there are plenty of places too where people do starve.)</dd>

<dd>The communist anarchists opposed the notion of contract. The labor-value individualists thought profit was exploitative but they respected contract as the higher law. If two people contract in a way that allows profit, that's sacrosanct to the individualsts --the profit shouldn't subsequently be expropriated. Here is Kropotkin denigrating freedom of contract: "Will you stand up for that piece of chicanery which consists in affirming "freedom of contract"? Or will you uphold equity, according to which a contract entered into between a man who has dined well and the man who sells his labor for bare subsistence, between the strong and the weak, is not a contract at all?" <a href="http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/kropotkin/appealtoyoung.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/kropotkin/appealtoyoung.html" rel="nofollow">[35]</a> As a contrast, Benjamin Tucker even upheld the legitimacy of contract between a drowning man and a rescuer who agrees only to rescue him if he promises to give him all of his possessions.. <a href="http://64.233.161.104/search?q=cache:HkVhoMGgLowJ:www.mises.org/journals/jls/1_4/1_4_4.pdf+%22benjamin+tucker%22+%2B%22carl+watner%22+%2B%22drowning+man%22&amp;hl=en" class="external autonumber" title="http://64.233.161.104/search?q=cache:HkVhoMGgLowJ:www.mises.org/journals/jls/1_4/1_4_4.pdf+%22benjamin+tucker%22+%2B%22carl+watner%22+%2B%22drowning+man%22&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">[36]</a> <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 19:35, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is a totally demagogic argument, in my opinion. Kropotkin said his opinion about this issue... in 1880! You ignore the historic context of *cuasifeudal* Russian Empire. This is a differente historic context from Tucker and his United States of this time. Why individualism is typically an american (USA) phenomenon? Because European countries as Russia had another historic context: aristocrats, royal families, great, very very great landwoners, that United States has not had. This is my opinion.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Appropriate Weight</span></h2>
<p>It appears to be near-consensus that, <i>philosophically</i>, anarcho-capitalism is a form of anarchism.</p>
<p>The other big question is appropriate weight. Currently, anarcho-capitalism has about as much space as anarcho-communism, but somewhat less than individualist anarchism and a lot less than anarcho-syndicalism (which has two sections.)</p>
<p>I would say that anarcho-capitalism will have about the right amount of coverage once the Rothbard picture is put back in (and the relevant book section is replaced.) The only inappropriate weight I see is the anarcho-syndicalist double section.</p>
<p>It's hard to determine proper weight. You could go by recent philosophical contributions, or by raw numbers involved in "movements," whatever they are. Was Laissez Faire City a movement? The Free State Project? Users of e-gold or Liberty Dollars? Cannabis producers and distributors? People who write for <a href="http://www.strike-the-root.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.strike-the-root.com/" rel="nofollow">Strike the Root</a>, <a href="http://www.anti-state.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.anti-state.com/" rel="nofollow">Anti-state.com</a> or <a href="http://www.againstpolitics.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.againstpolitics.com/" rel="nofollow">Against Politics</a>? How do we count all the minarchists that might be closet anarchists? How many <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.lewrockwell.com/" rel="nofollow">LewRockwell.com</a> readers are anarchists?</p>
<p>Should we decide <i>appropriate weight</i> by the number of books currently in print about each school of thought? <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/hoppe/hoppe5.html" class="external text" title="http://www.lewrockwell.com/hoppe/hoppe5.html" rel="nofollow">Anarcho-Capitalism: An Annotated Bibliography</a> is a good start for anarcho-capitalism. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 04:52, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I dispute your first sentance. It is more correct to say that there is near-consensus that there is a philosophy which calls itself anarcho-capitalism, and that that philosophy claims to be part of anarchism.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As far as weight goes, the entire article needs to be trimmed significantly. Sections are much too long. Individualism needs to be chopped severely. Most sections need to be no more than the equivalent of an introductory paragraph at the beginning of the main article of that subject. Chronological ordering of the emergence of a movement / philosophy to social prominance should order the latter sections which are primarily historical: this would result in anarcho-capitalism's section being listed last, which is apposite in terms of its significant difference with most other areas.</dd>

<dd>actually, I would guess post-left would come after an-cap, but I could be wrong (I don't know when post-left developed for sure, but I think it is pretty recent, like the last 20 years or so). Anyway, I don't believe there is consensus that an-cap is a form of anarchist philosophy per se, but that it is an offshoot (and in my opinion, perversion) of anarchism, specifically individualist. Therefore, it only deserves mention in the individualist section. And I second the Fifelfoo's comment regarding marijuana distrubuters (actually, he said users, but whatever), unless a large number identify as anarcho-capitalist. Show me cites for the "movement" aspects you are talking about (preferebly ones that received some media or academic attention) because I have not heard of any of those. Maybe there is a slight an-cap movement, but I doubt it is anywhere near the strength or visibility of anti-caps. And writting for/reading a magazine or book does not count as being part of a movement, that's armchair philosophy. Also, trimming sections is not a bad idea, as long as there is a clear link to that ideas own page. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force">The Ungovernable Force</a> 05:22, 13 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It looks like you're not realizing that anarchism comprises both social movements and philosophical movements. Even if there were only 5 anarcho-capitalists, if their philosophy is influential in the field of political philosophy then that's a notable form of anarchism (<i>philosophical anarchism</i>). As I pointed out above, 5 anarcho-capitalist philosophers could have more of an effect on how society structures itself than 5000 left anarchists protesting in the street (and they probably do). Of course there are more than 5 anarcho-capitalists, but you see my point. Anarcho-capitalism consists of both social movements AND philosophical movements. Trying to compare the extent or popularity of social movement anarchism and philosophical anarchism is like comparing apples and oranges. It just doesn't make sense. Individualist anarchism is primarily <i>philosophical anarchism</i>. In fact, the term "philosophical anarchism" used to be an interchangeable term for "individualist anarchism." <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 05:42, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think that was ever a consensus. The consensus was that it has some place within the article. I don't even care if it calls itself anarchism within the article. What I don't want to see is a single watered-down definition that tries to squeeze all anti-state philosophies under the anarchist label. I also don't think it's a matter of how many people classify this way or that, but its actual relation to anarchism as a whole. I think anarcho-capitalism is very notable within right libertarianism, but approach any generic anarchist discussion group and you won't find a very supportive reaction. In the case of anarcho-capitalism, its notability within the field might be more hinged around the question of whether it is a form of anarchism than the actual philosophy it represents, and its rejection of ideas common to most the rest of anarchism, prominently that of an oppostion to hierarchy and power, and the lack of necessity in anarchist society for either. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 05:24, 13 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>Anarcho-syndicalism and Industrial Unionism are two early 20th century working class industrial movements which sought to overthrow capitalism, states and institute a worker controlled society.</p>
<p>In the late 19th century, <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-syndicalism.html" title="Anarcho-syndicalism">anarcho-syndicalism</a> developed as a movement pursuing <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_action.html" title="Industrial action">industrial actions</a>, especially the <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_strike.html" title="General strike">general strike</a>, as the primary strategy to achieve anarchist revolution, and "build the new society in the shell of the old".

<p>After the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris_Commune_7d01.html" title="Paris Commune">1871 repression</a> French anarchism began to resurface and influenced the <i>Bourses de Travails</i> of autonomous workers groups and trade unions. From this movement the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conf%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration_G%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale_du_Travail_17f8.html" title="Confédération Générale du Travail">Confédération Générale du Travail</a> (General Confederation of Work, CGT) was formed in 1895 as the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement. Emile Pataud and Emile Pouget's writing for the CGT saw <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarian_communism.html" title="Libertarian communism">libertarian communism</a> developing from a <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_strike.html" title="General strike">general strike</a>. After 1914 the CGT moved away from anarcho-syndicalism due to the appeal of <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolshevism.html" title="Bolshevism">Bolshevism</a>. French-style syndicalism was a significant movement in Europe prior to 1921, and remained a significant movement in Spain until the mid 1940s.</p>
<p>The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) was founded in 1905 in the United States. It espoused <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_unionism.html" title="Industrial unionism">industrial union</a>, and sought to use the <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_strike.html" title="General strike">general strike</a> to usher in an Industrial Commonwealth (a stateless society). At its peak in 1923 the organization claimed some 100,000 members in good standing, and could marshal the support of perhaps 300,000 workers, the IWW's influence extended to Australia, New Zealand and Canada. While not explicitly syndicalist or anarchist, the IWW organised using working class rank and file democracy, and embodied a spirit of resistance and freedom which has inspired many Anglophone syndicalists.</p>
<p>Spanish anarchist trade union federations were formed in the 1870's, 1900 and 1910. The most successful was the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederaci%C3%B3n_Nacional_del_Trabajo_b9fe.html" title="Confederación Nacional del Trabajo">Confederación Nacional del Trabajo</a> (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), was founded in 1910. Prior to the 1940s the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics. It had a membership of 1.58 million in 1934. The CNT played a major role in the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Civil_War_7a30.html" title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a>. <i>See also:</i> <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_in_Spain_f47b.html" title="Anarchism in Spain">Anarchism in Spain</a>.</p>
<p>In the 1910-1917 <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexican_Revolution_7e35.html" title="Mexican Revolution">Mexican Revolution</a> anarcho-syndicalists like <a href="../../../r/i/c/Ricardo_Flores_Mag%C3%B3n_d420.html" title="Ricardo Flores Magón">Ricardo Flores Magón</a> were key figures. This success has been influential for <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_America_2c96.html" title="Latin America">Latin American</a> anarchism. This influence extends to the <a href="../../../z/a/p/Zapatista_Army_of_National_Liberation_cf98.html" title="Zapatista Army of National Liberation">Zapatista</a> rebellion and the factory occupation movements in Argentina and elsewhere.</p>
<p>In Berlin in 1922 the CNT was amongst trade unions who joined together to form the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Workers_Association_e143.html" title="International Workers Association">International Workers Association</a>, an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_International_5bd2.html" title="First International">First International</a>.</p>
<p>Contemporary anarcho-syndicalism continues as a minor force in many socities; much smaller than in the 1910s, 20s and 30s. Anarcho-syndicalists in general uphold principles of <i>workers solidarity</i>, <i><a href="../../../d/i/r/Direct_action.html" title="Direct action">direct action</a></i>, and <i>self-management</i>.</p>

<dd>I disagree with you about platformism, but it should be subsumed under the Russian Revolution section, due to the close relationship between Makhnovism and Platformism. Platformists are influential and significantly different to vague anarcho-communism, mainly due to their rigid organisation. I think that "Post-left" "Post-structuralism" "Insurrectionary anarchism" and "Small a anarchism" could all become one-line-wonders in a section titled "Eclectic, predominantly US, anarchist positions 1980-2005". If they're getting chopped, then Post-leftism needs to survive due to Bob Black's theoretical impact on US anarchism. I'm against putting the "single issue movements" under one heading, in part because anarcha-feminism isn't a single issue movement. Nationalist anarchism can be chopped or onelined (should be BJAONed as an internet phenomena of non-notable status). Primitivism needs to be addressed shortly but seperately (its just so bizarre in comparison to everything else). The entire article needs to become <b>much</b> <b>much</b> <b>much</b> less US focused, preening essensially US phenomena back to intro paras is a good way forward in this regard.<a href="../../../f/i/f/User%7EFifelfoo_12d0.html" title="User:Fifelfoo">Fifelfoo</a> 06:48, 13 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>random question, but what is BJAON? Also, post-left is important in my opinion and should have at least a few sentences. Same with primitivism. I will say I have no sources to back that up, other than my own observational experience. And hasn't anarcha-fem been around for quite some time? Sounds like it should have at least a paragraph.

<dd>BJAON stands for Bad Jokes and Deleted Nonsense. Its a potential vote on Articles for Deletion in wikipedia, which says, "This is garbage, but its so ridiculous that we should keep it to laugh at it." The nonsense gets moved out of the wiki and into a project page of bad jokes and deleted nonsense somewhere.

<dd>Oh, I've been there, funny stuff. And yeah, national anarchism deserves it. And yeah again, there is still a lot of sexism in the movement, and I'm guilty at times, as all men are. On a somewhat related note, I actually tried reading the <a href="../../../s/c/u/SCUM_Manifesto_0d5f.html" title="SCUM Manifesto">SCUM Manifesto</a> on saturday, but it was too ridiculous to finish. I thought I was supportive of radical feminist ideas, but that lady is insane (literally). Seems like a joke, but I don't think it was. I mean, c'mon, kill all the men to end sexism?

<p>Found a good essay on this at info-shop: <a href="http://infoshop.org/faq/secG7.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://infoshop.org/faq/secG7.html" rel="nofollow">[37]</a> That Spooner was against capitalism can be seen in his opposition to wage labour, which he wished to eliminate by turning capital over to those who work it. Like Benjamin Tucker, he wanted to create a society of associated producers -- self-employed farmers, artisans and co-operating workers -- rather than wage-slaves and capitalists. For example, in his Letter to Cleveland Spooner writes: "All the great establishments, of every kind, now in the hands of a few proprietors, but employing a great number of wage labourers, would be broken up; for few or no persons, who could hire capital and do business for themselves would consent to labour for wages for another."

<dd>Everybody knows that the labor-value individualists were not capitalists. Nobody argues that they are. You have to drop the labor-theory to convert to anarcho-capitalism. Spooner advocated that each individual start their own business (private ownership of the means of production) so they wouldnt have to share the profits with employers. Sounds like a good strategy. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 18:41, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't. The point is made over and over that they oppose profit. The opposition to profit is what makes them non-capitalist. But that doesn't mean that they have don't have similarities with anarcho-capitalists. They do. They support private ownership of the means of production, a market economy, money, and banking. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 19:42, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why then is it stated in the Tucker link above that: "Tucker believed that bankers' monopoly of the power to create credit and currency is the linchpin of capitalism. Although he thought that all forms of monopoly are detrimental to society, he maintained that the banking monopoly is the worst, since it is the root from which both the industrial-capitalist and landlordist monopolies grow and without which they would wither and die." And:<br />
here are, of course, many differences between the anarchism of, say, Bakunin and Kropotkin and that of Tucker. Tucker's system, for example, does retain some features usually associated with capitalism, such as competition between firms in a free market. However, the fundamental anarchist objection to capitalism is not that it involves markets but that it involves private property and wage slavery. Tucker's system was intended to eliminate both, which is why he called himself a socialist. This fact is overlooked by "anarcho"-capitalists who, in seeking to make Tucker one of their "founding fathers," point to the fact that he spoke of the advantages of owning "property." But it is apparent that by "property" he was referring to simple "possession" of land, tools, etc. by independent artisans, farmers, and co-operating workers (he used the word property "as denoting the labourer's individual possession of his product or his share of the joint product of himself and others." [Tucker, Instead of a Book, p. 394]. For, since Tucker saw his system as eliminating the ability of capitalists to maintain exploitative monopolies over the means of production, it is therefore true by definition that he advocated the elimination of "private property" in the capitalist sense.</p>

Although he thought that all forms of monopoly are detrimental to society, he maintained that the banking monopoly is the worst, since it is the root from which both the industrial-capitalist and landlordist monopolies grow and without which they would wither and die." This is right on the mark. What Tucker means by the banking monopoly is the requirement of having to get permission from the goverment (a charter) to start a bank and issue money. The regulations causes a quasi-monopoly situation. Tucker believed anyone should be able to start a bank that wished, without any regulations whatsoever. All individualist anarchists believe in <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_banking.html" title="Free banking">free banking</a>, including anarcho-capitalists. If the banking monopoly is the "linchpin of capitalism" then anarcho-capitalists also oppose the linchpin of capitalism. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 19:59, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The writer saying "wage slavery" is a little misleading. Tucker supported wage labor. What he opposed was profit being deducted from wages --he thought it was exploitative --depriving one who works of the portion of the value of his labor (nevertheless he believed in the right to contract for profit). If you want to call working for less than the full produce""wage slavery" fine, but it should have been explained by the author that Tucker didn't oppose wage labor. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 19:59, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

As Gary Elkin writes in Benjamin Tucker - Anarchist or capitalist?, "Tucker advocated *possession* but not private property, believing that empty land, houses, etc. should be squatted. He considered private property in land use (which he called the "land monopoly") as one of the four great evils of capitalism.""</p>

<dd>Well, this is a terminology issue. For libertarian individualists, as Tucker or Proudhon (a form of socialists, they called themself socialists) the term "private propierty" has another sense that for american (USA) right-wing libertarians (see above). You confuse anarcho-individualist, mutualist and libertarian socialist terminology. I think you have an historical error. Well, maybe in your country and for your ideology there is a terminology, but this not an "Official Standard", its only your ideology terminology. Anarcho-individualists and libertarian socialist has another terminology. For Proudhon (and all libertarian socialists) *_private_ property*, was state-privilegied burgueois propierty, and *_propierty_* workers propierty. You can have your terminology but you can't change the history and terminology of another people than you (as Proudhon, Tucker, libertarian socialists or me). You cannot impose to libertarian socialists, anarcho-individualists, mutualists, the history and me, your terminology. This is an encyclopedia, not a american (USA) rigt-wing libertarian site.

<dd>I'm flexible. Using Proudhon's terminology, <b>anarcho-capitalists are strongly opposed to private property</b>. We agree totally that state-decreed and imposed property is theft. Now, do you really think that this encyclopedia should say that anarcho-capitalists are against private property? Or would this simply confuse the hell out of most readers?

<p>The quoted Anarchist FAQ is (as usual) wrong when it says, <i>"However, the fundamental anarchist objection to capitalism is not that it involves markets but that it involves private property and wage slavery. Tucker's system was intended to eliminate both, which is why he called himself a socialist."</i></p>
<p>In fact, Tucker <i>supported</i> private property. He supported private <i>sticky</i> property in everything but natural resources; he supported private <i>possession</i> property in natural resources. In modern terminology, he was capitalist rather than socialist in this regard.</p>
<p>The FAQ writer shows total confusion when he writes, "In this Tucker followed Proudhon in rejecting modern conceptions of private property, in which property beyond that generated by labor and use is considered legitimate entitlement." He's confusing <i>who can legitimately own property</i> with <i>how can wealth be legitimately gained.</i> Property gained through labor/use and held by an individual is, by definition, <i>private property.</i> <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 17:17, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But, _only_ in the american (USA) right-wing libertarian terminolgy that you suppose a Standar, but it is _not_ a Standar, it is only your ideology terminology. Proudhon, Tucker and all libertarian socialists used and use another terminology where "private propierty" is State-privileged burgeois property. Anarchist FAQ writers are right. They uses this other terminology. They don't have any obligation to use right-wing libertarian terminology, because it is not an Standar. NPOV --83.97.228.16 20:47, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Given his anti-capitalist views, I just wonder how Spooner intended to operate the privately-owned mail-delivery company he founded in an attempt (suppressed by the government) to compete with the U.S. Post Office. Surely he wasn't going to personally hand-deliver every letter himself? Or was he a hypocrite, railing against wage-labor but hiring employees himself? <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan T.*</a> 23:11, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Spooner (and other LTV individualist anarchists) were <i>not</i> against paying someone to do a job; they were against profiting from it. I.e The payment to the carrier plus the cost of Spooner's administrative time should equal the price of the stamp; there should be no markup. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 23:32, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Proudhon's <i>"What is Property"</i></span></h2>
<p>After reading <i>What is Property</i> again, I added a paragraph of critique to the Wiki article <a href="../../../w/h/a/What_is_Property__14d1.html" title="What is Property?">What is Property?</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In <i>What is Property</i>, Proudhon claims to prove by contradiction ("property is impossible") that past justifications of private property are logically fallacious. Critics point out that the "proofs" do not contradict any widely held assumptions, but only Proudhon's notion of <i>equality of outcome</i>. As such, the "proofs" will not be convincing to those not sharing an extreme egalitarian notion of a just society. Furthermore, Proudhon's scholarship in relating opposing theories of property is suspect, e.g. his critique of Charles Comte's <i>Traité de la propriété</i> seems to be based on misunderstanding or misrepresentation of Comte's thesis.</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dd>Yes some - though not all - of his arguments 'by contradiction' rely on egalitarian premises. But you need to give citations for these 'critics'.<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBengalski_c6f3.html" title="User:Bengalski">Bengalski</a> 18:49, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>News flash! Wikipedia is publicly editable. Rather than contesting an entry and then locking it up, the person who thinks that anarcho-capitalism deserves more space SHOULD HAVE JUST EXPANDED IT! His failure to do so proves that he is, in all probability, just a troll. Here's a neat anarchist concept: contribute to the communal discussion rather than calling on authority to lock it up for the rest of the people.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Assassinations</span></h2>
<p>Why is it that the assassinations and terrorism of the late 19th/early 20th century only get a couple paragraphs of mention? The assassinations ended the lives of many important heads of state, and they established the reputation of anarchists as dangerous radicals. In a way, they were much more important to the development of anarchism than a lot of things presently in the article. At the very least, there should be another article listing those important figures who were assassinated by anarchists.--71.112.234.168 23:24, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There's a whole section called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism#Propaganda_by_the_deed" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism#Propaganda_by_the_deed" rel="nofollow">Propaganda by the Deed</a>, with four paragraphs and a photo. That seems like plenty, especially since most anarchists don't (and didn't then) approve of such actions.
