	    <p>What I think about this idea is that there are too many problems with overly slow language change to permit such an early date for Proto-Indo-European expansion. As well, attributing something as important as agriculture to them seems a bit much. That being said, however, there is without doubt SOMETHING to this theory. While the people in question were not Proto-IE (Proto-Indo-European) as we know it, they may well have had a MAJOR impact on the Proto-IE culture as we know it. Simply put, there are a good deal of deep grammatical rules and sounds that suggest that Proto-IE is related to Uralic (i.e. Finnish, Estonian, Hungarian, Komi, Udmurt, Ngagasian, and many others), BUT with a <i>very</i> heavy influence from the Caucasian languages. Some of these are suggested in Greenberg's highly controversial and in my eyes, at times highly suspect, Eurasiatic theory - though having said it to be controversial and suspect, there seems to be a good deal of potential truth that is merely overextended, and that could well be applied in comparisons between two languages, especially in the grammatical points. NOW. We know that there is a culture with Caucasian <i><b>AND</b></i> Indo-European characteristics, the Maykop Culture (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maykop_culture" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maykop_culture" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maykop_culture</a>). This is without doubt a terribly late date for influence, but if it were considered to be a descendent of other cultures in that region, it could well be <i>not only</i> the link for this Caucasian ad-/sub-/super-stratum of words in Proto-IE, but also, the Maykop culture ITSELF is <i>almost</i> a perfect match for a vehicle of transmission of some words of Semitic origin into Proto-IE (such as for "lion" and "wine", and possibly one of the words for "apple"), and vice-versa (maaaaaaaaaaybe the word for "star" in Proto-IE, *h2ster, could have begotten the Semitic word similar to the Akkadian ishtar (Goddess of Love and War, whose name might originally mean "star")).</p>
<p>But what of these Anatolian languages, huh? WELL, if one looks at the Kurgan hypothesis, such languages that emerged from Anatolia could have become - or at least influenced - many of the "Old European" languages. It is possible that this might account for Indo-European-like words in Etruscan, and a grammatical structure in Linear A that is reminiscent of Indo-European. The alternative is that these languages were given heavy doses of Indo-European Anatolian influence, or were even highly wayward Indo-European languages. The extreme waywardness, however, weakens the latter option (although it doesn't discount it completely).</p>
<p>One final point, just to be clear, should be made. The Basque language doesn't feature in this equation; the Basques seem to have been minding their own business in Iberia and southwestern France during this time. None of its core vocabulary is descended from any known language, and so it's probably just a hanger-on from goodness knows how long ago, maybe even back to the time of the Lascaux caves. Irregardless, it never really had an impact in Proto-Indo-European.</p>

<p>What do people think about the finding that <a href="../../../h/a/p/Haplogroup_R1b_%28Y-DNA%29_59e0.html" title="Haplogroup R1b (Y-DNA)">Haplogroup R1b</a>, the most typical Y-chromosome haplogroup among Western European populations (including Basques), is also present at readily detectable frequencies among populations such as the <a href="../../../u/y/g/Uyghur_people.html" title="Uyghur people">Uyghurs</a> of <a href="../../../x/i/n/Xinjiang.html" title="Xinjiang">Xinjiang</a> as well as among the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchu.html" title="Manchu">Manchus</a>, <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korean_people.html" title="Korean people">Koreans</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/n/Han_Chinese_7b2f.html" title="Han Chinese">Han Chinese</a>, etc.? It seems odd that mummies with distinctively Western European physical and genetic characteristics have been discovered in a region (i.e., Xinjiang) that is also strongly associated with the <a href="../../../t/o/c/Tocharian_languages.html" title="Tocharian languages">Tocharian languages</a>, whose apparent affinities with Indo-European languages of Central and Western Europe have long been of note. Personally, I am beginning to reconsider the possibility of the Paleolithic Continuity Hypothesis, or at least a theory that allows some sort of convergent evolution in the development of the Indo-European languages. It seems to me that one or two particular Paleolithic population(s) of Europe or Western Asia might have come into contact with a Neolithic population expanding from the Middle East, absorbed some cultural and perhaps genetic characteristics of the Neoliths of Middle Eastern origin, and subsequently spread features of their particular dialect(s) of Paleolithic European/Northwestern Asian language throughout much of the vast regions inhabited by related (formerly) Paleolithic tribes and perhaps even beyond into the territory of completely unrelated peoples. The sparsely attested languages of Classical Antiquity in Europe that appear to bear some sort of resemblance to Indo-European or Uralic languages could then be considered as remnants of the Paleolithic European/Northwestern Asian languages and dialects that were spoken in those areas prior to the immigration of Neolithicized Indo-European former-Paleoliths and concomitant linguistic homogenization of most of Europe. <a href="../../../e/b/i/User%7EEbizur_aeba.html" title="User:Ebizur">Ebizur</a> 03:37, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If you read the papers by Gray and Atkinson (e.g. <a href="http://language.psy.auckland.ac.nz/publications/index.php?tag=russell%20gray" class="external text" title="http://language.psy.auckland.ac.nz/publications/index.php?tag=russell%20gray" rel="nofollow">here</a>) you'll find that they are definitely NOT doing glottochronology. Glottochronology is a simple pairwise comparison between cognate counts. The phylogenetic approach they are using is very different and compares each lexical item, in each cognate set, in each language all at once and combines this with a model of lexical evolution. They are NOT the same thing.</p>
<dl>
<dd>they are not the same thing, but the term <a href="../../../g/l/o/Glottochronology.html" title="Glottochronology">glottochronology</a> spans the lot. Glottochronology is not <i>just</i> "the simple pairwise comparison between cognate counts", thank goodness, like other fields, glottochronology is allowed to make progress, and I grant you that the G&amp;A study is an example of 'advanced' glottochronology, yet still glottochronology. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(íÅ≥)</a></small> 09:40, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
