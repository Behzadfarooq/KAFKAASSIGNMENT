<p>Twenty three community associations are within Anaheim Hills, lead by the Anaheim Hills Planned Community Association, which oversees the entire community of Anaheim Hills. Two councils represent the community, the Canyon Hills Community Council and the Anaheim Hills Citizens Coalition. These two councils ensure that the <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_council.html" title="City council">city council</a> hears the desires and needs of the Anaheim Hills residents.</p>
<p>The community is listed under the Canyon and Hill General Plan within <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anaheim.html" title="Anaheim">Anaheim</a>. The city of Anaheim only allows estate sized lots in this community, and prohibits 23,000 square foot plus residential lots in any other part of the city besides Anaheim Hills. Furthermore, the city has rejected several plans to develop higher density units in the community, while approving these developments elsewhere in the city. In 2004, the city set a goal to construct 1,200 units of <a href="../../../a/f/f/Affordable_housing.html" title="Affordable housing">affordable housing</a>, however none of it will be constructed in Anaheim Hills but rather elsewhere in the city.</p>

<p>Prior to the <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_era.html" title="Modern era">modern era</a> of Anaheim Hills, the region was owned by Jose Antonio Yorba and his nephew Juan Pablo Peralta. They worked the 210,000 acre Anaheim Hills and <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorba_Linda%2C_California_5650.html" title="Yorba Linda, California">Yorba Linda</a> site in the early 1800s, which was used as a livestock ranch. It would change hands several times before it was sold to Louis Nohl in 1943 by the Bixby family.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in the nearby city of Anaheim, a housing boom was associated with the building of <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disneyland.html" title="Disneyland">Disneyland</a> in 1955 and other developments of that era. Anaheim began to expand its borders to encompass more land and the only direction was east, towards the location of the large Nohl Family farm.</p>
<p>In 1970, Nohl sold the land to the City of <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anaheim%2C_California_cba4.html" title="Anaheim, California">Anaheim</a> in order to create the community of Anaheim Hills. In October of 1971, Texaco Industries introduced an award winning plan, which they called a "master planned community." A premium golf course, nature trails, large homes, natural settings, and ranches were added to the Texaco Development plan in order to add to the appeal of the community for potential home buyers in the early 1970s, as they were amenities uncommon to many other Southern California communities at the time. Advertisements during this period were consistent in marketing the community as "The New Land."</p>
<p>The first community to premiere was Westridge which showcased 325 homes in 1972. The homes sold within two years of its premiere, creating an interest in the Anaheim Hills region. By the 1980s, Anaheim Hills had grown to 15,000 residents. There is a police substation and community center along Santa Ana Canyon Road.</p>

Almost all the development in the Anaheim Hills was included in the 1970s Texaco Masterplan, but were built (and will be built) by various builders between 1971 and 2010 following the original plan as approved by the city of <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anaheim.html" title="Anaheim">Anaheim</a>.</p>

<p><b>Peralta Hills</b> is a residential community located along Santa Ana Canyon Road between Imperial Highway and Nohl Canyon Road. The community was founded in the mid 1970's, and was designed for custom home lots. Many of the lots are between 31,000 and 120,000 square feet with homes valued up to $10,000,000. The community is unique in that the roads are less than 30 feet wide, and large native trees are prominent within the community. Many of the homes are gated and set deep on their lots. There is an estimated 200 lots in the community, but the expansion of the community to include Peralta Hills East will add many more residences.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

<p>Following the unusually wet winter of 2005 brought drought conditions to Southern California that hadn't been seen for nearly a decade. The normally lush hills turned to dry golden timber.</p>
<p>A wildfire broke out on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_7.html" title="February 7">February 7</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> in the <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland_National_Forest_4b5b.html" title="Cleveland National Forest">Cleveland National Forest</a>, the National Forest that separates Anaheim Hills from the Riverside County Border. This fire grew intensely after days of fierce 20 mph winds and soaring 80 degree Fahrenheit temperatures, which fueled the relentless blaze. On the morning of <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_9.html" title="February 9">February 9</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, conditions worsened, and out of fear for the homes that sit only half a mile away in Anaheim Hills, nearly 75% of the Community of Anaheim Hills was under evacuation, some mandatory and some voluntary. This resulted in the closing of two local elementary schools for two full days, and several other schools served as shelters for the evacuees during the day.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[17]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[18]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_10.html" title="February 10">February 10</a>, when Canyon Rim Elementary was the most threatened public structure, those students were moved to Canyon High School, which housed all the evacuated schools. The fire was soon put out, but it burned over 10,000 acres of land and caused significant natural resource damage by burning a recovering Tecate cypress grove. It was later determined that a controlled blaze set by the Cleveland National Forest started the fire, and the National Forestry Service was forced to pay the large bill from the firefighting efforts.</p>
