<p>This is just to inform people that I want Wikipedia to accept a general policy that BC and AD represent a Christian Point of View and should be used only when they are appropriate, that is, in the context of expressing or providing an account of a Christian point of view. In other contexts, I argue that they violate our NPOV policy and we should use BCE and CE instead.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ideas</span></h2>
<p>I glanced through the page, and it looks pretty comprehensive, but a few things could make it better:</p>
<ol>
<li>The template is huge. Perhaps instead of listing everything (e.g. every school of anarchism) in the template, we could put in links to the <i>categories</i> of articles (like <i>schools</i> of anarchism) and so on. See the new <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarianism.html" title="Libertarianism">Libertarianism</a> template, for example.</li>
<li>The article itself is too long. Surely some of this could be removed or moved to other articles?</li>
<li>More criticism should be available to the reader, though perhaps not in this article. Maybe Criticism of Anarchism or something.</li>
</ol>

</dl>
<p>And I don't. Here's my retaliations;</p>
<ol>
<li>Then you instead suggest they should trough even more sub-articles to find their wanted school, thus makin' it more complicated than needed, instead to find it all on one, clean and simple template? There were never anything wrong with "long templates", and should stay so! Filling every need.</li>
<li>BARF! Outrageous suggestion. So we should rather, "deinformatize" the topic instead, you suggest? "Shred off the excess details"? Nonsense. And it would not find context to be put anywhere, what-other article? A "sub-article"? Utterly needless moving and "decantralization", and also, doesn't change the size of thing to "chop it down in pieces", it still takes as much bandwith..or even more...just makes it more harder to find, when putting in another category.....and as for REMOVED, that's out of question! An article should be as long as it haves to, no information subtracted or hidden! Wikipedia is here for to ABSORB KNOWLEDGE, and we must feed it by giving alot of information. This cannot devolve backwards into some kind of "rough guide" or "basic information" stuff. There's summaries on top fer that.</li>
<li>Surely, yeah, we could MAYBE link to people who have made criticism's of Anarchism, But not make an own article for it! That's too little on for. It just basically revolves around "it would create chaos!"-arguments, or variants of that. It could be made, however, but a short section mentioning the most important ones (....) of Anarchism.</li>
</ol>

<dl>
<dd>"Retaliation" is the right word. Perhaps you could try being a little less aggressive? Anyway, my own perspective:
<ol>
<li>I think the template could do with a little editing to make it shorter, but really, any discussion on this point should go to <a href="../../../a/n/a/Template_talk%7EAnarchism_dbc2.html" title="Template talk:Anarchism">Template talk:Anarchism</a></li>
<li>The article <b>is</b> too long - there are suggested limits on article size for a reason. But there are already separate articles about most of the different schools of anarchism (just look at the template!), so really all that needs to be done here is just to summarize each of the schools and provide a link to the main article. We shouldn't remove the sections on the different schools or types, just make them more concise.</li>
<li>A separate article for criticism of anarchy wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing. After all, anarchy is a highly controversial viewpoint. We have separate articles for <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_criticisms_of_Microsoft_bbb7.html" title="Common criticisms of Microsoft">Common criticisms of Microsoft</a>, after all, and Microsoft is just a company, not a political viewpoint. And there are specific criticisms that can be brought forth against anarchy - for example, that people wouldn't be productive in an anarchic society because there's no reason for competition. Of course, there are also counter-arguments, and so on, but it's not Wikipedia's job to evaluate whether a certain standpoint is reasonable or not - Wikipedia is just here to describe them. And that's what I think it should do.</li>

<dd>Eh? What has this got to do with anarchism? It sounds more related to philosophical debates about free will versus determinism, or something like that.

<dd>From what it sounds like the linkage from self-organizing systems to anarchism is something that is not written about extensively and from what I can make of the article is hardly authoritative on the subject.

Certainly the german editors of <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchismus" class="external text" title="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchismus" rel="nofollow">anarchism</a> should be interested in this material but unless you can find anarchist scholars that link anarchism to neuroscience, I don't think this material is appropriate for the article, no matter how interesting it is to us. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbamuth_eea6.html" title="User:Albamuth">albamuth</a> 04:16, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Anarchist objections to "authoritarian" hierarchy vs "social" hierarchy</span></h2>
<p>I have reverted some of the wording of this article, believing that some of it should return to that used prior to a few edits of the last few weeks. Specifically the substitution of hostility to <i>social</i> hierarchy rather than to <i>authoritarian</i> hierarchy, and the change from "On its own anarchism does not provide a world view beyond the idea that imposed authority is undesirable and unnecessary." to "...beyond the idea that social hierarchy (of all sorts) is undesirable and unnecessary."</p>
<p>I spent some hours in thought before I changed these back to the previous wording, and am now presenting some of the reasons that I did so.</p>
<p>Breaking with the notion that there are individuals or groups that can be relied upon as if they were divinely established as entirely superior or inferior to others is an important step of great wisdom. Proceeding from that to the notion that there cannot be or must not be any form of value based hierarchy at all is a step into absurdity.</p>
<p>In any group, some form of formal or informal social hierarchies innately <i>must</i> exist, even if they are of trust and distrust based merely upon personal experiences. Authoritarian hierarchies, where the valuations of one or many are imposed on others without their consent are objectionable to the concepts of justice and are not innately mandated by reason or passion, though they have often been so by custom and habit.</p>
<p>Apart from absolute recluses, and not even excluding solipsists, one can, and indeed MUST have some form of social hierarchies... hierarchies of valuation and association that come into play in interactions with other individuals.</p>
<p>In ideal states of awareness and interaction hierarchies that exist will be acknowledged and honored based upon mutual recognition and consent, but there are many hierarchies that are real and necessary, whether one is able or inclined to acknowledge them or not. <b>In all forms of human endeavor we must expect that there always are, and always will be hierarchies of the honest and the dishonest, the aware and the unaware, the active and the passive, the strong and the weak, the fortunate and the unfortunate. In all human activities there always are and always must be hierarchies of the involved and the uninvolved, the caring and the uncaring, of truth and falsehood, certainty and uncertainty, clarity and obscurity, security and danger, wisdom and confusion.</b></p>
<p>To speak of life or existence without any form of hierarchy at all is often a reaction to some of the more foul, unjust, brutal and artificial hierarchies that have existed, yet it is ultimately a form of sheer nonsense, often proclaimed by those who have given the matter but a very shallow and casual examination.</p>
<p>I can heartily agree that any form of Anarchy philosophically adheres to the idea that in any human society, imposed authority is undesirable and detrimental, but apart from those who dwell in states of profound ignorance and extreme confusion, I don't believe that there are any who would or could absolutely reject all notion of hierarchy, social or otherwise.</p>
<p>Though the analysis of benefits and detriments can often be very complex and variable, even within the minds of individuals, there are very few people with any depth of insight who would even pretend to embrace the absurd positions that there are no valid, important, and indeed vital hierarchies of good and bad, even if notions of each must vary considerably from person to person, culture to culture, and age to age, and the prospect of establishing any clear definitions or absolute standards appear forever remote or impossible. Most people, however hostile they might be to some specific forms of hierarchy can recognize that there are hierarchies of superiority to societies that embrace paths of liberty, justice, honor and reason, above those that embrace tyranny, indifference, treachery and treason to all forms of human dignity. ~ <a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchilles_a41f.html" title="User:Achilles">Achilles</a> <a href="../../../a/c/h/User_talk%7EAchilles_ced4.html" title="User talk:Achilles">†</a> 12:46, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No offence but this is byfar one the most outlandish things I've seen on here. How in the hell can you claim the word hierarchy does not means classes, or authority or any other words you want to use. Anarchy is NON-HIERARCHAL in every facet! Exerting your authority over another invidual or group of individuals is social hierarchy. Social hierarchy includes racism, sexism, ageism, homophobia, etc. --<a href="../../../f/a/t/User%7EFatal_5ada.html" title="User:Fatal">Fatal</a> 22:24, 28 May 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There is an implicit claim to authority in a few of your declarations, and your suggestion that I "read a book". I have read many books; I would suggest you use your reason a bit more thoroughly. Hierarchy is a term often used in defining matters of valuation that do not include the manifestations of artificial or imposed authority. There are truths, there are falsehoods, there is wisdom and foolishness, clarity and error, and there are usually a great deal of gradations between many extremes which impel hierarchal perspectives upon things. People can have equal right to express themselves, argue their views, change or develop their opinions, without falling into the absurd contention that an absolute rejection of tyranny impels an absolute rejection of social hierarchies of valuation, based on various forms of practical competence in social endeavors, or an absolute presumption that what some particular people find to be "outlandish" is what everyone should find so. Tyrannical social hierarchies have definitely existed which have focused on many or all the abhorrent criteria that you cite— they have also, at least occasionally, existed in non-tyrannical forms, involving relations of mutual understanding and consent, that focus on such criteria as being honest, lucid, considerate and able to look at things from more than one range of perspectives, or one narrow set of definitions, interests, or objectives.</dd>

<dd>The article had existed for some time with the previous wording, and I find the newer adjustments to be far too absurd to merit permanence. ~ <a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchilles_a41f.html" title="User:Achilles">Achilles</a> <a href="../../../a/c/h/User_talk%7EAchilles_ced4.html" title="User talk:Achilles">†</a> 06:40, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="http://www.answers.com/hierarchy&amp;r=67" class="external text" title="http://www.answers.com/hierarchy&amp;r=67" rel="nofollow">This link</a> provides some common definitions and concepts of hierarchy, most of which do not innately imply any abhorrent impositions, though certainly many cases of such can be cited. Although many people often have blithely and casually denounced the hierarchies of others, for valid or invalid reasons, from the perspectives of their <i>own</i> hierarchies of value, and such narrow and constrained definitions that they hold to be authoritatively absolute and unquestionable, to my knowledge there has not been any instance where attempts at a complete rejection of hierarchy have been able to maintain any form of stability or permanence, beyond the limited life-spans of some adamantly obstinate individuals who might vociferously deny that they have anything to do with hierarchies, while they never for one moment can completely abandon them, in any <i>real</i> sense. Saying, or even believing, that one is opposed to all hierarchy does not make it so. Saying one is opposed to all artificial and imposed hierarchies is something that can be rationally, and practically maintained, by both individuals and by societies that have endured, prospered, and inspired many, though often to such extent that they attract the envy and resentments of others who become intent on damaging or destroying them.</dd>

<dd>I support Liberty, Truth, Honesty, Compassion and Fairness as ideals worthy of attention and promotion, and assert that one cannot support them very ably if one has but a very narrow sense of what people can mean when they use the terms, or would insist that only one's own particular manner of defining things is useful or accurate. In a very narrow way, ignoring all other possible definitions and perceptions, some of what you say can make perfect sense, but in very many other ways that many people can be inclined to interpret it, much of it is patent nonsense. I strongly support liberty of thought and action, but I have cringed when people take such absurdly absolutists stands as many do, against the notions and absolutes of others, and do so while they insist that they reject all authority or hierarchy.</dd>

<dd>I agree with you Achilles. To an anarchist, a "hierarchy" shouldn't matter unless coercion is involved. Some people are physically stronger than others.That's hierarchical, but so what? As long as the stronger aren't imposing themselves on the weaker it's still anarchism. (At least it's still anarchism if anarchism is to be a cogent and rational philosophy.

<dd>Question: What does "imposed authority" actually mean? Sure you have a point with some of what you say about the term "social hierarchy". Its meaning does not include (imo) rejecting some modes of thought; it involves rather the interactions between people. Anarchists reject (imo) being forced to do anything, including by the majority.</dd>
<dd>The term imposed authority seems to me to be a capitalist one. That is you have a choice of working for one person for a pittance or another for the same amount, there is no imposed authority you choice which one you want. However, surely anarchists would reject this state of affairs all together?</dd>

<p>What does this mean: "forms of imposed or involuntary authority including social hierarchy."&#160;?? The whole statement seems incoherent to me. Would different levels of wealth be considered social hierarchy? And would that constitute involuntary authority? If so, how does someone having more stuff than me constitute involuntary authority over me unless he engages in coercion against me? What if he minds his own business ...is that still involuntary authority? This hierarchy thing just seems absurd.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">a few clarifications</span></h3>
<p>I seek to keep anarchy something that remains recognizable as the <i>very</i> "broad tent" range of ideas it long has been, rather than attempt to shoehorn it into a few particularly narrow channels of ideology.</p>
<p>To defend my position that Anarchy is NOT innately hostile to all hierarchy and all authority, I will cite the expressions of someone that even few of those who most casually call themselves anarchists could accuse of not being a <i>genuine</i> spokesman for Anarchism, one of the founding theorists of modern anarchism (whose birthday it happens to be), <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mikhail_Bakunin_11a1.html" title="Mikhail Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</a>, from his excellent work, <i>God and the State</i> (1876):</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>Does it follow that I reject all authority? Far from me such a thought. In the matter of boots, I refer to the authority of the bootmaker; concerning houses, canals, or railroads, I consult that of the architect or engineer.</b> For such or such special knowledge I apply to such or such a <i>savant</i>. But <b>I allow neither the bootmaker nor the architect nor the <i>savant</i> to impose his authority upon me. I listen to them freely and with all the respect merited by their intelligence, their character, their knowledge, reserving always my incontestable right of criticism and censure. I do not content myself with consulting authority in any special branch; I consult several; I compare their opinions, and choose that which seems to me the soundest. But I recognize no infallible authority, even in special questions; consequently, whatever respect I may have for the honesty and the sincerity of such or such an individual, I have no absolute faith in any person. Such a faith would be fatal to my reason, to my liberty, and even to the success of my undertakings; it would immediately transform me into a stupid slave, an instrument of the will and interests of others.</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>AND</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>I bow before the authority of special men because it is imposed upon me by my own reason. I am conscious of my inability to grasp, in all its details and positive developments, any very large portion of human knowledge.</b> The greatest intelligence would not be equal to a comprehension of the whole. <b>Thence results, for science as well as for industry, the necessity of the division and association of labor. I receive and I give— such is human life. Each directs and is directed in his turn. Therefore there is no fixed and constant authority, but a continual exchange of mutual, temporary, and, above all, voluntary authority and subordination.</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is perfectly anti-authoritarian recognition of the reality and necessity of BOTH authority <i>and</i> hierarchy, that rejects all artificially imposed hierarchy or authority.</p>
<p>How are these views that I share with Bakunin himself to be deemed "beyond the pale" of Anarchy. Persistence in what certain individuals would like to claim to be the absolutely "non-hierarchal" nature of "Anarchy" is itself an absurdly authoritarian-like attempt at the imposition of an absurd notion, which to my perspective is itself not only an <i>abuse</i> of the term anarchy, but of rational integrity itself.</p>
<p>If I am often a bit "wordy", when I do express ideas, I would state that it is mostly because I spend much more time reading, observing, and actually thinking than I do in pronouncing my views, or vacuously regurgitating the expressions of others. When I do attempt to express ideas I am well aware that there are often many perspectives of many people to take into account, and when there is any conflict between the two, meticulous honesty is a better ideal to aim for than impressive or apparently witty boldness. I am acutely aware that I might come into conflict with the short attention spans, bigotry, and limited intellectual capacities and integrity of many people, and yet I feel that I should not be too casual in expressing statements upon such things as most people are inclined to be <i>far</i> too casual in thinking upon or interpreting. <b>I don't presume that I always get things right, or express things in the most ideal way, but I usually make an effort to express what appears right to me as precisely and thoroughly as I can, within such circumstances as exist.</b></p>
<p>A common set of attitudes and practices with many people is to presume that they are entirely right, others entirely wrong, and all discussion of the matter is but a troublesome nuisance to the promotion of such views as they feel should be accepted without question or objection. It is especially and irritating when such behavior and attitudes are evident in those who would claim to be speaking for policies like Anarchy, or ideals like Liberty and Justice.</p>

<p>Touching upon what seems to have been a previous debate here, I would agree that capitalism does in most regards involve systems and attitudes which are usually innately coercive, and in <i>opposition</i> to anarchism. Even so, a person might in many ways be anti-capitalist, as well as anti-authoritarian, and yet not seek to totally condemn or exclude people who would call themselves "capitalists", or anything else, though their aims and assumptions might be alien to many of their own. Even if some people are very hypocritically presumptive authoritarians who would like to call themselves "communists", "socialists", "anarchists", or "capitalists" I would not presume them to be totally right or totally wrong in all their views. I would assert that they would not be very capable or reliable allies in any quest for the rejection and abandonment of capitalist policies or the authoritarian domination of governmental systems. ~ <a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchilles_a41f.html" title="User:Achilles">Achilles</a> <a href="../../../a/c/h/User_talk%7EAchilles_ced4.html" title="User talk:Achilles">†</a> 04:15, 30 May 2005 (UTC) + minor revisions ending at 07:23, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are a few assumptions here that are not correct. When Bakunin speaks of the "authority" of the bootmaker, he is not (and nor is anyone else in the same context), using the word "authority" in the same way, in a hierarchal sense. Tons of words have multiple meanings and authority is one of them. A politician is used with the word "authority" to mean someone higher on social hierarchy, and person dominating those 'below' him. However, when one says that one is, for example, "a great authority in art" they mean that they are very knowledgable of art. One who is knowledgeble in art in this way is not exerting authority over others, one who is to be asked permission to make art or anything in a hierarchal sense, it's simply a different use of the term. When anarchists say they want to abolish all authority, all hierarchy, it is very clear to me and to really anyone else, including one who knows nothing of anarchism other than that definition, that anarchists are speaking of authority in that sense, a hierarchal, dominating, sense. To eliminate all domination. Quivelling over these uses of words is pretty trivial. Words don't matter, it's what the person says and means by them that is important. If one were to create a term like "yakkanomium" whose meaning was freedom, I would shout yakkanomium from the rooftops! Just in case you intend on bringing it up, when people quivel over little details of "what if a child is running into the street about to get hit by a car? Is it authoritarian to stop them?" some anarchists will come up with the terms irrational and rational authority. However I don't like these terms given they're confusing, however the concept is pretty straightforward, that if you're doing something like saving someone from running into a car, then that's rational, however I think it pretty irrational to call that authoritarian. More like concern for others. However these are the sorts or rediculous concepts people come up with when they want to explain the insanely intricate details of a philosophy or way of thinking, when it's the broad idea that is the most important. Arguing about these little things is much like what the idiot Marxists do, who anarchists so vehemently oppose, but if we're going to oppose the Marxists who do nothing but spend decades in a room debating to death what every little word meant that Marx and Engels said, then we can't act like them. And just to make it a little more clear, yes I am indeed using this to refer to your comments about "authoritarian" statements in my last post. This is much like the uneducated responses people give to anarchists when they have absolutely no idea what they are even arguing about, but constantly looking for some kind of weakness in another person so they can try and "catch" them when they're not looking, which is a self-defeating and pointless activity. --<a href="../../../f/a/t/User%7EFatal_5ada.html" title="User:Fatal">Fatal</a> 17:04, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think the distinction between being an "authority" by being knowledgeable and well-respected in a field, and the hierarchical sort of "authority" that is opposed by anarchists, is not as much of a clear, bright-line distinction as the anarchists would like it to be. In fact, in communities such as that of the arts, science, technical fields, "computer geeks", and so on, there are social hierarchies that began simply as the voluntary social relationships of respect for those who were more knowledgeable and skilled at the given field; over time, this naturally evolves into a social hierarchy where the more "popular" people (partially a meritocracy based on ability, but partly a social "popularity contest" based on social skills and the good and bad luck various newcomers had at making a first impression on the "insiders" with more social power) have lots of influence on the entire group, which they can sometimes wield in a manner that seems coercive to those who end up on their bad side. This is an inevitable part of human nature, manifested everywhere from middle-school cliques to the treatment of people with unconventional ideas by the scientific community. It's also found in the behavior of chimpanzees, so it's apparently embedded in our DNA. It's not something that anarchists are going to make go away in their utopian society, no matter how much wishful thinking they put into it. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan*</a> 17:55, May 30, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, every time I see people of a socialistic bent advocate a society totally free of hierarchy, where "all (men/women/persons) are created equal" with absolutely no difference in status and power, I'm reminded of <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harrison_Bergeron_99eb.html" title="Harrison Bergeron">Harrison Bergeron</a>, the Kurt Vonnegut story where equality is forced on all by the imposition of handicaps that drag down the intelligence, strength, and beauty of everybody to a lowest common denominator so that nobody stands out, and gains greater power in a social hierarchy, by being better than anybody else in any way. Enforcing this takes a massive degree of government power, so obviously it's not possible in an anarchist society, but it would seem to be the only possible way of even attempting such a "non-hierarchical" society. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan*</a> 18:04, May 30, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think there is a significant confusion between <a href="../../../e/q/u/Equality.html" title="Equality">equality</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sameness.html" title="Sameness">sameness</a>. Former is a refference to not being forced by another to do something and not forcing somebody else oneself. Latter is about having the same ammount of food. Here is the example: Person A likes sandwiches with the crust, while person B cannot eat crust at all... and they both want two sandwiches. By the law of sameness we will give each a sandwich with crust and a sandwich without... making both misirable. While equality would mean that they get what they actually want, although it is <b>not</b> the same thing. Now as for <a href="../../../d/n/a/DNA_396c.html" title="DNA">DNA</a> forcing us to force others to do things, it is possible that it is true, however, having public <a href="../../../o/r/g/Orgy.html" title="Orgy">orgies</a> is the way that some chimps resolve their social problems... but how many times do you see this happening in our society today?

<p>Even the Wiki article on "capitalism" admits that the definition of capitalism is widely debated, and within anarchist circles the primary focus of anti-capitalist action is confined to economic systems subject to state control. The exchange of goods between two parties, theoretically a capitalist action, is not largely condemned by anarchists; the phrase "opposition to capitalism (is an) unvarying principle of anarchism" is an oversimplification.</p>
<p>Anarchists have historically also been in opposition to other state-sponsored economic systems, including Stalinist socialism. It may be more accurate to say "opposition to state-sponsored economic systems" to acknowledge this, but I chose not to make such a large change without feedback.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with you. "Opposition to capitalism" doesn't mean much when different schools of thought have different definitions. There is no telling what peculiar definition of capitalism any given radical may have. It would be better to spell out exactly what elements or practices are opposed.

<dd>I find the phrase "opposition to capitalism (is an) unvarying principle of anarchism" to be problematic for a myriad of reasons. The primary reason is that capitalism is not a concrete system existing in space-time - it is a concept, no more capable of existing than the infamous <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Forms_7914.html" title="The Forms">Platonic chair</a>, perhaps even less because the "vital essence" of capitalism is itself debated. As such, if we are to talk about capitalism and the anarchist critique of its effects on real people existing in space-time, we must place it within the context of a real system which also occurs in space-time - the reason why I added "government-sponsored" as a modifier to "capitalism."</dd>
<dd>Another problematic factor is that the phrase excludes any critique of other models. Nearly every economic system existing in modern history has been opposed in some way by anarchists, including systems based on socialist, communist, and capitalist philosophies.</dd>
<dd>To rigidly state that anarchism is inherently opposed to one exclusive philosophy implies an extremely authoritarian and logically unsound assumption and ignores a significant mass of anarchist action throughout history. Amaz0n

<dd>The article isn't about anarcho-capitalism. Besides, an obscure branch of right-libertarianism founded rather recently cannot yet have "classics" on par with things like God and the State and certainly shouldn't be bunched in like that without comment. It's misleading. An observer would be lead to believe that Rothbard is the leading anarchist thinker, when in fact he's not even an anarchist and like eleven people have heard of him. --<a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETothebarricades.tk_2bb0.html" title="User:Tothebarricades.tk">Tothebarricades.tk</a> 02:19, Jun 4, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Rothbard is "Mr. Libertarian," the father of anarcho-capitalism. (Well, there's Molerini...) All the readers of LewRockwell.com and Mieses.org number well over 11. Fact: Rothbard is a leading anarchist thinker. That's an objective NPOV evaluation. So I'm going to add in those anarco-capitalist classics, and add one more classic: Leopold Kohrs' "The Breakdown of Nations." The NPOV policy requires that both anarcho-socialism and anarcho-capitalism be presented in an unbiased manner. This means that you should not delete ancap books. --<a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 17:13, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Naming the section "anarcho-socialism" is incorrect. Not all anarchists can be called "anarcho-socialists." Creating a binary opposition between socialist and capitalist anarchism is just anarcho-capitalist bullshit (like a lot of this article). And to whoever keeps trying to list Murray Rothbard's complete works, please stop it. --<a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETothebarricades.tk_2bb0.html" title="User:Tothebarricades.tk">Tothebarricades.tk</a> 22:27, Jun 4, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Since when did we decide that "balanced" meant changing the meaning of anarchism?</span></h2>
<p>We've debated the inclusion of anarcho-capitalism so many times it's making me sick. I'm not opposed to including A-C in the "Schools" section, because that makes sense. However, to simply redefine anarchism as being only essentially anti-statist is absolutely ludicrous. Should I de-archive the last big debate, or do people know how to click that link? Obviously, the unwillingness to let this issue lie as the majority of people see fit (that is, to have the article be about the commonly inderstood meaning of anarchism as <b>anticapitalist AND antistatist</b>) is simply belligerance from the same biased editors trumpeting their cause, in the guise of making the article "fair and balanced." Read <a href="../../../a/n/a/Talk%7EAnarchism_Archive16_1108.html" title="Talk:Anarchism/Archive16">Talk:Anarchism/Archive16</a> and look at that whole survey process we went through; Observe that a large majority agreed that anarchism is about an anti-statist, anti-capitalist political philosophy. People were split on whether or not to mention A-C '<i>at all</i> in the article, so we do include it, <i>but not as part of the article's own definition of anarchist beliefs</i>. That is the reason for the disambiguation in the first place. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbamuth_eea6.html" title="User:Albamuth">albamuth</a> 01:27, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This has gone on in cycles several times over the past year, each time this article seems to just get worse. I've also seen quite a few editors come and go in that time. Each time new editors join the war both "sides" become less willing to compromise. Now we've even gotten to the point where some are erasing the NPOV tag, even when its obvious to anyone with any bit of rationality left that the current article is in dispute. I would suggest that you don't make any substantial edits until these sock-puppets and new eduit warriors are finnished having their fun, at which time we can just revert back to the previously stable edit. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillerc_2ebe.html" title="User:Millerc">millerc</a> 02:51, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

This is not a dictionary of word origins, it's an encyclopedia, and 99.99% of anarchism is inherently anti-capitalist, except for a peripherally relevant trend with almost no influence or historical significance. Directing the very small percentage of readers who would come to this page looking for information of anarcho-capitalism to the proper article rather than deliberately misleading the large number of people who have never heard of it is a very reasonable course of action. --<a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETothebarricades.tk_2bb0.html" title="User:Tothebarricades.tk">Tothebarricades.tk</a> 19:01, Jun 5, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Exactly. Also it shows Hitler and Mussolini as capitalists. Huh? Nazism was short for National-Socialism, was it not? My point is that political tendencies cannot be reduced to simply two axes on a chart and I know of no cases of anarchists referring to charts to describe their politics. Not only that, but it oversimplifies the difference between the "schools" of anarchism (most of which do not even disagree with each other enough to qualify as disparate "schools"). The difference between Proudhon and Bakunin cannot be reduced to: "Proudhon is more capitalistic than Bakunin" - that just doesn't make any sense!! --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbamuth_eea6.html" title="User:Albamuth">albamuth</a> 02:48, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>&gt;Does anyone else find it absurd that the (US) Democrats are on the "socialist" side of the chart? Not I, since the Demo faction of the War Party tends to favor nationalisation (e.g. health insurance, state ownership of airwaves) while the Rep faction favors regulation.</p>
<p>&gt;Also it shows Hitler and Mussolini as capitalists. Huh? Nazism was short for National-Socialism, was it not? Yes, but the means used - Mussolini's govt controlled corporate cartels and such - kept the capitalist form of de jure private property, as did Hitler (most of the time.) Please read the caption on the ideomap, as that may help understanding.</p>
<p>&gt;I found a version of it here on wikipedia... Yes, the ideomap is basically a more detailed version of the chart used by the Political Compass Organisation, shown in <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_spectrum.html" title="Political spectrum">Political spectrum</a>.</p>
<p>&gt;The difference between Proudhon and Bakunin cannot be reduced to: "Proudhon is more capitalistic than Bakunin"... Was Proudhon more tolerant of outward capitalist forms? Obviously. He didn't want a revolution, with violent destruction of capitalism. He wanted his mutuals to out-compete capitalist firms. You might say that Proudhon (and Tucker) considered capitalism a vice, but not a crime.</p>

<p>Actually, no. I find it unproductive to put the authoritarian label next to the names of both parties, instead of putting it where totalitarianism is placed. Also, Fascism is placed totally incorrectly, as fascism or nazism were not liberal (economically), nor totally statist. Check Political Compass website again. Also, Friedman, according to the same website, is not anarcho-capitalist, but would be placed where you put libertarians. In all, it would be better to have the Political Compass map with a mention where anarchism would probably be placed. That's in case people here want a map. <a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuis_rib_dc5a.html" title="User:Luis rib">Luis rib</a> 20:57, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Luis&gt; "I find it unproductive to put the authoritarian label next to the names of both parties, instead of putting it where totalitarianism is placed."</p>
<p>"Authoritarian" and "libertarian" are relative terms. Totalitarianism and anarchism are absolute terms. IOW Totalitarianism is extreme authoritarianism, and anarchism is extreme libertarianism. Perhaps this <i>relative authoritarianism</i> of the Demos and Reps would be better illustrated if I moved the dots up a little, and put the party labels above the dots. Would this address your concern that the Dems&amp;Reps are labeled authoritarian? (As opposed to my intention - that they are <i>relatively</i> authoritarian.)</p>
<p>Luis&gt; "Also, Fascism is placed totally incorrectly, as fascism or nazism were not liberal (economically)..."</p>
<p>But, as the caption notes, "Capitalism" here does not mean economic liberalism - it means "the outward appearance (legal fiction) of property ownership." Did Hitler and Mussolini keep nominal private ownership forms, or did they nationalize industries in the name of the collective? Almost always (with the notable exception of Volkswagon) they opted for the former. Do you agree?</p>
<p>Luis&gt; "... nor totally statist."</p>
<p>Here I get it. Good point. (Testing my understanding...) You are saying that fascism describes the whole lower right quadrant, that it's a <i>relative</i> term. Would it suit you if I relabeled the Hitler/Mussolini/lrcorner dot as "Totalitarian Fascism"? (And correspondingly the llcorner relabeled "Totalitarian Communism"?)</p>
<p>Luis&gt; Also, Friedman, according to the same website, is not anarcho-capitalist...</p>
<p>Whoa! The compass site was talking about Milton Friedman. I'm talking about <b>David</b> Friedman (Milton's son) who is a full-fledged anarcho-capitalist. (Most famous book: "The Machinery of Freedom.") Hence the "D."</p>
<p>Luis&gt; "In all, it would be better to have the Political Compass map with a mention where anarchism would probably be placed."</p>
<p>But the section is about <b>schools of anarchism</b>. The point is to differentiate between schools. The ideomap shows approx. where the different schools (or famous proponents of those schools) fall. You'd only need a one-dimensional libery-authority map to show where anarchism stands. (The y-projection of the ideomap.)</p>

<dd>I don't think it's authoritarian. Speaking for myself, I've tried hard to base my arguments on reason and not pointing to wikipedia policies but I'd have to say hogeye loses on both accounts in this case. It is authoritarian however to attempt to subvert the will of a community and its processes for discussion by enforcing your opinion through what is wikipedia's equivalent of force.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Nat, you seem to think that the only argument against hogeye et al. is that we don't like their ideas because we're fanatical anarchists. I don't think this is the case. The case for including AC analysis throughout this article simply doesn't hold up. What I and others have been arguing is already a compromise, I believe initially the idea was not even to mention the phrase "anarcho-capitalism" - that is of course not neutral, but recognizing its pariah status and treating it as such within this article is the only viable way to go. The article is not called, after all, "Anarchism vs. anarcho-capitalism" which it would have to become if we introduce the very different ideas of AC - the AC article should likewise not be peppered with quips from Bakunin. Including it in the "Schools" section and creating a very visible disambig-type header at the top is reasonable and I don't see how one could object on grounds other than ideology. --<a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETothebarricades.tk_2bb0.html" title="User:Tothebarricades.tk">Tothebarricades.tk</a> 17:32, Jun 6, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I was arguing specifically against the use of the survey, not your attempts generally to conduct the dispute by reason (rather than by voting). I do not mean to say that you have no other basis for arguing against hogeye. Personally, I don't see the point, either, in discussing A-C and socialist anarchism together on the same page, interspersed with each other. They should be separate articles; the only question in my mind is where to put the article on the latter. The compromise you suggest seems acceptable to me. - <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Kraus</a><a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">e</a> 04:04, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Well I agree with you Nat. The problem is, the A-C party wants to characterize the A-C faction as a major split with historical anarchism, which I feel is misleading because they are such a severe minority/interest group. The truth is that A-C's are not a <b>splinter group</b> from traditional anarchists, but a outside group that is trying to co-op the romantic allure of the "anarchist" radical label. At least, that is all their actions are aimed at achieving. Personally, I think that that real A-C's should be contributing and expanding the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchist_economics.html" title="Anarchist economics">anarchist economics</a> article, as it is more specifically involved in their ideological battle, particularly with a theoretical stateless economic system.

<dd>It is the NPOV policy of wikipedia that all significant POVs be described in situations like these. AC is significant enough to merit description, I don't think anyone is denying that.

<dd>However, it is also NPOV policy that representing all POVs does not imply representing them disproportionate to their significance. Traditional anarchism has a much longer history, including unions and federations of hundreds of thousands of people and significant influence on major historical events, yet you want to present it side-by-side with equal space for anarcho-capitalism by redefining the very definition of anarchism to ensure that it is compatible with the AC conception thereof. This would be about as ridiculous as committing half of this article to primitivism, or redefining the intro to ensure that it is compatible with any and all possible claimaints to the title regardless of there modern or historical significance, like say nationalist anarchism or anarcho-monarchy, or my personal favorite, anarcho-facism. But none of this matters to you, all that matters to your is that your flag gets pushed a little farther toward the front of the line, intellectual integrity and political context be damned. That is why I'm reverting you, and will continue to do so until you and several other partisans show some sign of relenting in this POV war. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 05:57, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Kev&gt; "It is the NPOV policy of wikipedia that all significant POVs be described in situations like these. AC is significant enough to merit description, I don't think anyone is denying that."</p>
<p><br />
Bullshit. Every little mention of anarcho-capitalism gets deleted. Every little ancap counter-point to even the most outrageous claims get deleted. Anarchist books in the book section get deleted. Perhaps not you, Kev, but too many ansocs think they "own" the definition.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is only your own ignorance that has brought you to this perception that my claim is "bullshit." Had you bothered to even read the history of this article, and the talk pages which are so conviently archived above, you would see the basis for my comments. That no one is denying that AC is significant enough to merit description is evidenced by the fact that no one has ever tried to VfD the AC article (this is more than I can say for several of the traditional anarchism articles btw, which anarcho-capitalist sympathizers have on more that one occasion either tried to VfD or simply blanked). That referance to it in -this- article is removed by many people, sometimes even myself despite the fact that I have often indicated my desire to have it referanced here, is certainly not an attempt to remove AC from wikipedia altogether. My own recent removals have mostly revolved around the continuous attempts by several AC partisans to import horribly biased wording or slanted presentations, over and over again regardless of how many times their same arguments have been dealt with, apparently because these people fail to understand or actively try to dismantle the NPOV policy of this project.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The more general attempts to remove referance to AC from this page stem from an attempt by ACs some months ago to do this themselves. Several individuals took it upon themselves to disambiguate this page in an attempt to ensure that "anarchism" linked to a page that prominently displayed AC as one of only two forms of anarchism, they reverted to this solution of their so often that pretty much everyone gave up and simply allowed it. I warned them against this many times, cause I had seen it attempted before, but they kept pushing, and in the process they made it clear that this page was no longer about anarchism in general (that was now the domain of the disambiguation page), but rather traditional anarchism. Unfortunately, for them, their attempt totally backfired when the disambiguation page was fleshed out with all the myriad forms of anarchism that actually belonged on it, making it clear to all wikipedia readers not only that anarcho-capitalism is merely one of many claimaints, but one that is of dubious credit that is almost universally rejected by the other, as well. This is what lead to the situation today, where a few editors are unwilling to see this article even referance AC, because it was the ACs themselves who so resolutely insisted on disambiguating the page and they see it as a slap in the face that this page would -both- begin with a disambiguation indicating that this is not the only meaning of anarchism -and- describe anarcho-capitalism in it as a form of anarchism when the entire point of making the disambiguation page was to make further descriptions of ac in this article unnecessary. The hilarious thing is that this is exactly what you are trying to do now, create yet another disambiguation page, even though it has already been done before and will eventually lead to exactly what it already has (a disambiguation page that does not over-emphasize anarcho-capitalism as you are trying to do, and a general anarchism page that does not mention anarcho-capitalism at all). <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 10:20, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Kev&gt; "However, it is also NPOV policy that representing all POVs does not imply representing them disproportionate to their significance."</p>
<p><br />
Fine. That's not the problem here. The problem is "defining away" the other school. E.g. <b>It is not neutral to claim that anarchism is anti-capitalist.</b> I have no problem with the article saying "many anarchists consider anarchism to be anti-capitalist," nor with having the bulk of the article about anarcho-socialist movements and history.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Then you must not have any problem with a definition which states that anarchism is compatible with state government. After all, there are real live, I kid you not, people out there who call themselves "anarcho-monarchists", and according to your standard the only neutral way to handle their claim is to make sure that the very page which defines anarchism on wikipedia changes the actual meaning of anarchism in order to deal with the ridiculous claims of what is at best a minor branch off the actual philosophy and at worst a horrible attempt to subvert it. Kinda like anarcho-capitalism, in that regard. There are also total idiots, people not so unlike our very own Sam Spade, who think that because some people refer to <i>anarchy</i> as chaos this must mean that <i>anarchism</i> is the philosophy advocating chaos, even though there has never been a single philosopher who has ever advocated anarchism as such, nor even much evidence at all that the word anarchism has been used to refer to such in any significant context. Must we now change this article to allow for those who believe in the total destruction of all human institutions? I can see it now, "Anarchism is the philosophy which advocates chaos and disorder, states ruled by monarchy, capitalism, and the rejection of all the above. Anarchism is whatever wikipedia editors say it is, all depending on the political axe they have to grind." I'm sorry Hogeye, but I'm not personally prepared to stand aside as you strip all meaning from the word anarchism just because it gives some small measure of support to your political preferances. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 10:20, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Been there, done that, and here we are again today. The only difference is that you weren't here last time this was done, or the other three times that people tried to make this page a disambiguation page, while I was. But I can assure you, even if I sat back and allowed you to totally bias this page toward anarcho-capitalism by over-emphasizing it to an extreme, the eventual result of your handiwork would not please you at all. Maybe you should attempt to do something that only 2 anarcho-capitalists (Rothbard and McElroy) have ever tried to do, and learn the history of the situation before you come to conclusions about it. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 10:20, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The only non-joke references to "anarcho-monarchism" I find on the web are to Han-Hermann Hoppe ("Democracy: The God That Failed") and Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn. The former is simply an anarchist who believes that democracy is worse than monarchy. Hoppe makes it very clear in his book that no government is best of all. As for Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn, I don't know for sure since I haven't read his book. Judging from a review (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0895265370/002-7864288-2741627?v=glance" class="external free" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0895265370/002-7864288-2741627?v=glance" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0895265370/002-7864288-2741627?v=glance</a>) he may be making the same point as Hoppe. --<a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 16:45, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No anarcho-monarchists have yet appeared to stump for their cause on wikipedia, so-called anarcho-nationalists have, but that isn't the point. I have met two people who consider themselves to be anarcho-monarchists in the past, and if you want I could try to dig up the contact information for one of them. I don't see why this is remotely relevant though, as the point is not that there are stupid people saying stupid things, we both already know that, but that just because some small group makes claim to the larger tradition of anarchism this does not mean that wikipedia must change the basic meaning of anarchism in favor of a cherry picked definition of said small group. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 18:20, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Free-Market Anarchism</span></h2>
<p>Free-market anarchism has been around since the beginning of anarchist philosophy--long before so-called socialist "anarchism" came on the scene. See, e.g., A Vindication of Natural Society by Edmund Burke (1756)--for commentary on this, see the article "Rothbard and Burke vs. the Cold War Burkeans" by Joseph R. Stromberg, April 1, 2002 <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/stromberg/stromberg32.html" class="external free" title="http://www.lewrockwell.com/stromberg/stromberg32.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lewrockwell.com/stromberg/stromberg32.html</a> . See also Josiah Warren's writtings, who the historian Prof. James J. Martin believes was the first person to adopt the label anarchist (for more on this, see the article "American Anarchism" by Wendy McElroy, January 1, 2000 <a href="http://www.independent.org/issues/article.asp?id=10" class="external free" title="http://www.independent.org/issues/article.asp?id=10" rel="nofollow">http://www.independent.org/issues/article.asp?id=10</a> ).</p>
<p>Besides Edmund Burke and Josiah Warren, let's not forget Gustave de Molinari, Lysander Spooner, Benjamin Tucker, Auberon Herbert, Albert Jay Nock, Murray N. Rothbard, David D. Friedman, or Hans-Hermann Hoppe. One can even include Lao Tse in the laissez-faire anarchism camp.</p>
<p>It is the phoney anarchism of the socialists which ought to have no place in an entry on anarchism other than to point out their misnomer, due to their use of the misnomer "anarchism" as referring to their raving statism. Qadir 17:18, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>lol, this is just sad. Have there been anarchists who believed in a free-market for as long as there have been anarcho-socialists? Of course, I follow in that tradition myself, But all of the "free-market" anarchists of that time were resolutely against capitalism, and would have believed that the "free-market" advocated by anarcho-capitalists is not free at all. Apparently, the only way ACs can even attempt to add legitimacy to their claims is to purposefully overlook this fact, to use the same terms the individualists used but in totally different ways, much like the anarcho-capitalists use the term anarchism to mean something totally different than what it meant before. You might as well be a state president talking about expanding freedom by invading other countries at this point, because that is how much meaning you have to strip from the words you are using in order to make them consistent. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 18:25, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If you define capitalism as being enforced via the state, then ALL anarchists would be opposed to that. How can ANY anarchist be against a free-market devoid of coercion? Is that not what they seek? <a href="http://traffic.alexa.com/graph?w=379&amp;h=216&amp;r=6m&amp;y=r&amp;u=lewrockwell.com/&amp;u=www.infoshop.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://traffic.alexa.com/graph?w=379&amp;h=216&amp;r=6m&amp;y=r&amp;u=lewrockwell.com/&amp;u=www.infoshop.org" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>Would Socialist Anarchists be tolerant of Free-Market Anarchists should the state disappear? Would the socialists try to stop the free-marketers from owning cars and homes by force?</p>
<p>Would the Free-Market Anarchists tolerate the Socialist Anarchists should the state disappear? Would they allow them to set up communes and unions leaving them to their own devices?</p>
<p>In my opinion, the Free-Market Anarchist would tolerate the Socialist Anarchists and leave them alone. I don't think the Socialist Anarchists would be as tolerant based on what I've read about their theories - sounds exactly like state-sponsored socialism to me.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Two Version Editing Dispute</span></h2>
<p>There are two main definitions of anarchism:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_%28anti-state%29.html" title="Anarchism (anti-state)">Anarchism (anti-state)</a> - the theory or doctrine that all forms of government are unnecessary, oppressive, and undesirable and should be abolished.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_%28socialist%29.html" title="Anarchism (socialist)">Anarchism (socialist)</a> - philosophies, movements, and ideologies that advocate the abolition of capitalist exploitation and all other forms of authority.</li>
</ul>
<p>The dispute is about whether it is better to have the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anarchism&amp;oldid=14880685|" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anarchism&amp;oldid=14880685|" rel="nofollow">Neutral Disambiguation Page</a>, or have a page using <i>one or the other or both</i> definitions given above.</p>
<p>The first alternative has these advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>avoids an intractible edit war</li>
<li>allows the user to decide which meaning he's interested in</li>
<li>resolves a real ambiguity in the meaning of "anarchism"</li>
</ul>
<p>The second alternative has the advantage of keeping to one article, but has a major problem: <b>permanent instability</b>. There has been and will continue to be a continuous edit war over the "proper" definition. The anti-state definition is more inclusive - socialist forms of anarchism are a subset of Anarchism (anti-state). OTOH the socialist definition of "anarchism" is exclusive - it denies that propertarian statelessness is anarchism at all. What does this mean in practice, taking into account Wiki institutional constraints? It means that the more numerous anarcho-socialist partisans will continually attempt to censor out references to anarcho-capitalism, and slant the article to their anti-capitalist POV.</p>
<p>Basically, the choice comes down to this: Either we have two relatively stable articles,one for each definition, or we have one highly unstable article, which switches definitions depending on who edited it last.</p>
<p>The logical question is: are there really two legitimate definitions? The practical question is: Is it better to have two good articles or one contentious article and permanent edit wars? --<a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 17:25, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think there should an article called "Anarchism" that that encompasses all forms of anarchism, including both collectivist and individualist forms. As the writer in the above section noted, the individualist market anarchists have just as much or more "tradition" than the Euro-anarchists. And given, that anarcho-capitalism is a form of individualist anarchism it should be mentioned as well. The writers of this article either had no clue that there was anything but Euro/collectivist anarchism or are just biased beyond belief. It's time for a change.

Having a disambig page is against the general standard that the most well-known meaning of an article is the "main" one with disambig notes at the top. Face it guys, no one cares about anarcho-capitalism except for anarcho-capitalists and wikipedia gadflies, unless that is, if they are vehemently denouncing it. So just casually portraying it as an accepted school of anarchist thought (as with the "anarcho-capitalists, on the other hand..." stuff in the one section) is patent nonsense. I just don't see why its not reasonable to have a disambig note and keep a section under schools, it's not like we're trying to speedy delete the anarcho-capitalism article (which I tend to leave alone). By the way, trying to include it here based on your own philosophical beliefs ("anarcho-capitalism is a legitimate form of anarchism regardless of what the rest of the world says because: a, b, c..."), and the above argument about supposed connections with Tucker, is a perfect example of original research and can easily be rejected solely on those grounds. --<a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETothebarricades.tk_2bb0.html" title="User:Tothebarricades.tk">Tothebarricades</a> 20:17, Jun 8, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Do I expect you to read the archives? Yes I do, even though you won't, in fact even if you said you did I'd know that you wouldn't because to date not a single one in your position has ever done such an act, so don't even bother. I believe you're mixing this article up with <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalism.html" title="Capitalism">Capitalism</a> which is available through the link I made. Certainly this article's contents would look a bit strange on the page you're looking for! So I can understand your misunderstanding. I give you the benefit of the doubt that you accidently clicked on the wrong link and got here because surely you wouldn't be one of those capitalist nutcases that wants to intergrate your crazy profitful system into anarchism, a milieu entirely opposed in every single aspect to capitalism, currently, 5 minutes ago, 50 years ago, and the values of anarchists before capitalism even existed were opposed to anarchism. Terribly sorry, but you don't change hundreds (if not thousands if you count examples like the taoists and other anarchistic groups of people) of years of opposition to hierarchy simply because Al Gore invented the internet so that you can attempt and fail miserably to spread your completely false views on a philosophy you clearly know very very little about. --<a href="../../../f/a/t/User%7EFatal_5ada.html" title="User:Fatal">Fatal</a> 21:25, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I happen to believe this article is basically worthless garbage --horribly conceived, horribly written, horribly organized, and horribly deficient. It doesn't matter if some or all of this has been gone through before and a consensus was reached. Today is a different day, and it's time to war again. Past consensus is irrelevant. Now there is not a consensus. After this edit war is settled, there will be another, and another, and another, ad infinitum. If you want something that lasts, write a book.

<dd>RJII, that's nonsense. I don't think perpetual edit war is a desirable state and it could easily be avoided by steps I've discussed above. One section under schools, one disambig note, and we have a stable and neutral article that directs the reader to information about anarcho-capitalism if he or she so desires. No minority viewpoint should have excessive representation in any article (notice that the <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government.html" title="Government">government</a> article is not 50% anarchist viewpoints, for good reason). You think anarcho-capitalism is legitimate, fine: it doesn't really matter. That's original research, and secondly is a highly controversial view that no other anarchist, probably no one but the anarcho-capitalists themselves and their three or four wikipedia partisans, agrees with. --<a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETothebarricades.tk_2bb0.html" title="User:Tothebarricades.tk">Tothebarricades</a> 14:32, Jun 9, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Do you realize that individual anarchists, such as Benjamin Tucker, claimed that the communist anarchists are not real anarchists, because they oppose private property and wages? The various schools of anarchism compete with each other. You're just being a baby, like Tucker, in claiming that the others are not "real anarchism." Whatever, dude. Every school that regards itself as anarchism is anarchism, and should be included. Anarcho-capitalism has been around since at least the 50's. It's well established. Anarchism is not one movement, but a set of movements with different beliefs. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 15:38, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<p>I think unbiased readers will admit that Tucker thinks Herbert is an anarchist, not only from this comment, but the lavish praise Tucker heaps upon him.</p>
<p>Tucker: "Mr. Herbert proved beyond question that the government of man by man is utterly without justification, but is quite ignorant of the fact that interest, rent, and profits will find no place in the perfect economic order."</p>
<p>Translation: Herbert is beyond question an anarchist, but his his capitalism is mistaken.</p>
<p>If you don't know enough about Herbert to realized he's a hard-core propertarian capitalist, I suggest you read, "The Right and Wrong of Compulsion by the State." Auberon Herbert was the ideological 'son' of Herbert Spencer, another well-known capitalist. --<a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 00:54, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Tucker was definitely not an anarcho-capitalist; he opposed capitalism (capitalism being the entirety of a set of conditions). But, like the anarcho-capitalists, he was an individualist anarchist. Anarchism can be divided into two broad schools ..individualist anarchism and collectivist anarchism. It looks like this article, so far, has wanted to be just about collectivist anarchism. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 03:00, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Anarcho-capitalists want to make a false divide between socialist anarchists and individualists. I am both an individualist and a socialist. So was Tucker. So are many anarchists today. Yes, anarchism can be divided into individualist anarchism and collectivist anarchism, it can also be divided into anarchists who pick their noses and anarchists who don't. The fact that we can make artificial divides as intellectual tools does not in itself lend credence to AC claims.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for Tucker calling Herbert an anarchist, I can't help but note that he in fact did not. You have interpreted his statements as such, when at most all he said (as I already made clear), was that Herbert was inspired by the same idea. I'm inspired by many of the same ideas as Socrates myself, but that doesn't make me a Greek philosopher. If you are trying to tell me that according to your own personal definition of anarchism Herbert is an anarchist, then you aren't telling me much of anything at all. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 03:25, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Hogeye in that the page should be about the broadest reasonable definition of the term. Simply because AC has been more recently defined, doesnt mean anything. Example... Blood types were previously unknown. Then the the definition was broadened to include A, B, O, types. Then it was broadened again to include pluses and minuses. This hardly means that newer blood types definitions dilute the original definition, it means were more clearly defining the definition.

In my view, capitalism is identical to a free market system. i.e. If I made a paper airplane and traded it to you for your twinky, thats capitalism... Some would obviously disagree. To the extent that you would forbid people from trading freely, I would point that its you that are trying to impose your "system" on them.<a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmicV_d4e0.html" title="User:CosmicV">CosmicV</a> 16:45, 10 Jun 2005</dd>

<dd>"some people's definition of the term Capitalism differs from others"! Well yes. The guy defines it as not involving the exploitation of others and so, <i>pouf</i>, the problem disappears! "Anarcho-capitalists" require definitions of both "anarchy" <i>and</i> "capitalism" that are very far removed from those common. Mind you, ACs would have to give the States back to the Indians -- "In particular, once a place or good has been first appropriated by, in John Locke’s phrase, 'mixing one’s labor' with it, ownership in such places and goods can be acquired only by means of a voluntary – contractual – transfer of its property title from a previous to a later owner." (Hoppe, see AC page)-- and the material wealth of the West to the impoverished Third World it was stolen from, so they should probably be encouraged&#160;;-) <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 01:01, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Only kidding. Of course, Hoppe went on to say that this was not at all retrospective. You have the right to what you already have. So "anarcho-capitalists" don't want to rid us of hierarchy. They want to <i>entrench</i> it as the status quo. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 01:04, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The key sentence in your response is ""Anarcho-capitalists" require definitions of both "anarchy" <i>and</i> "capitalism" that are very far removed from those common". The truth is that practically all of the definitions of capitalism Im seeing at various dictionaries or encyclopedias say pretty much the same thing. Example: <a href="http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article?tocId=9359742&amp;query=capitalism&amp;ct=" class="external free" title="http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article?tocId=9359742&amp;query=capitalism&amp;ct=" rel="nofollow">http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article?tocId=9359742&amp;query=capitalism&amp;ct=</a> Note how in the summary paragraph there is no mention of corporations. Why? Because corporations are not the defining characteristic of capitalism. So your concept of a common definition of capitalism being one that differs from mine isnt entirely true. YOU may think corporations are required for it, but most sources dont imply they are required.<a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmicV_d4e0.html" title="User:CosmicV">CosmicV</a> 11:05, 10 Jun 2005</dd>

No, I came to make a proposal to disambiguate the article on <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milk.html" title="Milk">Milk</a> because it inaccurately describes it as a dairy product. This is POV!!!

I can barely keep from laughing reading sam spade talking about how "some" anarchists are anti-capitalist (of course he'll never even cross the boundary of "sorta") and trying to sound all intellectual. You are truly hilarious and you seriously must be saying this stuff either for our entertainment or for the sport of trolling. You make anti-capitalism sound like a small issue in the anarchist milieu, a clear indication you've never talked to an anarchist in your entire life, outside of the so called "anarchists" you said you used to get drunk with. Maybe that alcohol went to your brain. To say that anarchists have not been anti-capitalist is like saying that Israel hasn't killed Palestinians or that wood doesn't come from trees.

<dd>FYI, it was Fatal who started the section ==<b>Stop the misrepresentation of milk! You "socialists" have been defiling the word "milk" for long enough!</b>== and began it with "<i>Hogeye, I mean this in the most intellectual way, are you fucking stupid?</i>". - <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Kraus</a><a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">e</a> 09:38, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>True, he started the whole analogy thing. Anyway, let's look at the analogies. The one about music is clearly nonsense. Classical music is not the original form of music, changed only in recent years only by hip-hop etc. For centuries, there has been stuff like bagpipes, flamenco, bongo music etc. The meaning of "music" has not changed in the last century. The term has always covered a wide range of rhythms and instruments. Someone plucked from the Middle Ages would recognise jazz as music, whether he liked it or not. Therefore, those of us who object to the appropriation of the term "anarchism" have no problem with "music" referring to things other than classical music, and on this we are consistent. We would, however, have a problem with the term "music" being appropriated by <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musica_universalis.html" title="Musica universalis">music of the spheres</a> enthusiasts, because the music of the spheres, despite its name, is not music. It deserves a place on a disambig page only. In this we are consistent.</dd>

<dd>As for dictionary definitions, they are over simplified. The OED says "belief in the abolition of all government and the organization of society on a cooperative basis." <a href="http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/anarchism?view=uk" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/anarchism?view=uk" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. That sounds good to me (and excludes capitalism), but it forgets to mention that anarchists are not just negatively against government but positively in favour of freedom — I don't think anyone denies that this is a key part of any good definition of the term. Since pro-capitalists are not against tyranny per se, but are simply in favour of power being wielded by unaccountable entrepreneurs instead of elected representatives, there can be no question that their ideology is as far removed from anarchism as the music of the spheres is from music. — <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChameleon_a79b.html" title="User:Chameleon"><i>Chameleon</i></a> 10:16, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, I think the phrase "music of the spheres" is using a definition of "music" that's much older than the modern, narrower restriction of that word to the auditory arts; the ancient Greeks used the word "music" to refer to a wide range of artistic expression, not all involving sound. But anyway, regarding "pro-freedom anarchism", I've always regarded anarcho-capitalism as being the variety of anarchism that truly supports freedom -- free minds and free markets -- while the other varieties will tolerate whatever limited subset of freedom may be permitted by the collectivist syndicates and communes that are in control. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan*</a> 13:59, Jun 9, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, "music" derives from "muse" and was extremely broad in Greek times, basically equivalent with "culture." Do you see what madness the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music.html" title="Music">music</a> article would be if we based it on word origins and subjective conclusions based on these origins? That's what some are trying to do here. --<a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETothebarricades.tk_2bb0.html" title="User:Tothebarricades.tk">Tothebarricades</a> 14:38, Jun 9, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>??? No it doesn't exclude capitalism. In capitalism, society is organized on the cooperative basis of private property. Perhaps you don't know the difference between "cooperative" and "collectivist?" --70.178.26.242 15:43, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I in no way am calling my comments on milk intelligent or productive. Rather, they're the opposite of both on purpose. In case you didn't notice, I did that to very clearly make fun of the idiotic logic of capitalists trying to jump up and down saying "Me too!". Private property is coercive, read any one of the many many anarchists texts that discuss this topic. I suppose all those anarchists squatters robbing landlords of their private property around the world are in favor of capitalism right? I suppose the anarchists in seattle in 99 were capitalist right? I suppose the "propaganda by the deed" attacks on capitalists were indeed capitalists who simply had personal grievances with them! I suppose Emma Goldman was a capitalist, given that she gave countless speeches against capitalism not to mention actions and arrests, I suppose she was being sarcastic right? I suppose the 2000 anarchists that met in DC recently to counter the inauguration were capitalist right? I suppose the 7 million people that create an anarchist society in Spain in 1936 were capitalist right? I suppose every anarchist in history was a capitalist making comments simply on a humorous note right?? Show me a capitalist at any of these events and I'll show you a waiver for a mental hospital! Your definitions, textbooks, property, and money won't save you when the truth comes back and bites you. --<a href="../../../f/a/t/User%7EFatal_5ada.html" title="User:Fatal">Fatal</a> 23:17, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
