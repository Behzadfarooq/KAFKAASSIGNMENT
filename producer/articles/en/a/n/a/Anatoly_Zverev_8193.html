<p><b>Anatoly (Anatoli) Zverev</b> (<a href="../../../1/9/3/1931.html" title="1931">1931</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>), a founder of Russian Expressionism in the 1960s was a <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russian</a> painter of the non-conformist movement. He was born, lived, worked, and died in <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moscow.html" title="Moscow">Moscow</a>.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><a href="../../../p/i/c/Picasso.html" title="Picasso">Picasso</a> considered Anatoly (Anatoli) Zverev the best Russian master. Zverev had dozens of personal exhibitions in major cities of the world but he never had a one-man show in his own country, Russia, almost until his death in 1986. Only a handful of experts abroad and in Russia cherished his talent and from time to time they exhibited *his works in underground galleries hiding them from <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet.html" title="Soviet">Soviet</a> officials.</p>
<p>Nevertheless Zverev's artistic worth was known to the Government as his paintings were *not allowed to be take out of the country as they were considered "National Heritage".</p>
<p>Zverev's fame abroad annoyed the Soviet authorities and they harassed and persecuted him all his life. Maybe they would have been happy to tame the artist by pouring money on him and making him their representative of the officially accepted and notorious Socialist realism. If only he could be one! But... he could not. He would not have been Zverev as an artist and as a person if he had compromised.</p>
<p>And Zverev would not have become the founder of Russian abstract expressionism if he had been another personality. He did not become Zverev, an artist. He was born and remained him all his life. And that is the clue to Zverev's phenomenon.</p>
<p>In fact Zverev heard much praise in his lifetime: "His place is in the Pantheon" (<a href="../../../i/g/o/Igor_Markevitch_07a0.html" title="Igor Markevitch">Igor Markevitch</a>, French conductor of Ukrainian origin) "artists of that calibre are born only in 100 years" (<a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Falk_b7ea.html" title="Robert Falk">Robert Falk</a>, a famous painter). Zverev consciously shunned commercialism and fame.</p>
<p>He knew that real warmth and understanding could not be bought for money. So he surrounded himself with true friends who were trying to support him and guard him from the <a href="../../../k/g/b/KGB_8668.html" title="KGB">KGB</a>'s persecution.</p>
<p>It seems that this extreme thirst for independence lead Anatoly to the discovery of a unique style and techniques. He could not follow the fashionable "isms" of the time. Subconsciously he was doing what his inner drive dictated and not because something was fashionable or forbidden; he became a non-conformist against his will. It was pure spiritual nonconformism born as a result of this inner search for self-expression. Thus he organically became the founder of the new "ism" without being aware of it. His new technique "<a href="../../../t/a/c/Tachisme.html" title="Tachisme">tachisme</a>" was born as a result and not out of imitation of some prominent artist.</p>
<p><a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackson_Pollock_e5b4.html" title="Jackson Pollock">Jackson Pollock</a> and Anatoly Zverev simultaneously discovered the style without knowing each other. That was probably the Universal clock which determined the appearance of certain personalities and certain artistic styles. But what is important to note is that Anatoly Zverev based his creative searches on a very deep philosophical conviction: he was zealously devoted to the idea of momentalism. It was his firm belief that everything which surrounds us is in constant change. He was convinced that the more you look the more distorted images appear in your mind. So in order to penetrate the essence of a thing and reflect it on the canvas an artist must catch each moment, fathom and fully experience it through his creativity.</p>
<p>All his life he was perfecting his technique to achieve immediate exactness, to render the first direct sensation. And in this respect he became a real virtuoso. No mistakes, no blind searches. Some unwittingly considered his speed as a trick. Watching him paint was quite an experience. His eyes began to burn (not metaphorically) as if invisible fiery rods connected his fixed gaze and the object he was drawing. Each gesture, each brush stroke was exact, brisque and calculated. One had no time even to follow his movements, they seemed chaotic and random. You could not guess what he was planning to achieve until the very last stroke. Suddenly you see a finished work, extremely expressive, rhythmical and balanced. He did not give a final answer, his personal sensations are to be finalised by the viewer. His works are fragile and metaphorical. He leaves space for various interpretations.</p>
<p>He had no permanent shelter, he never knew where he would spend the next night. He never stayed long in one place. He seemed to be living in the present time without looking back, without making plans for the future. He was never in a hurry as there was nothing to be late for in his life. Zverev was absolutely indifferent to material values. He always wore shabby clothing and it was impossible to better his attire. He would immediately give away anything to anybody else who happened to like it.</p>
<p>Zverev was not easy to get to know. His language was metaphorical, his manners were sometimes provocative. He could be rude if he sensed some mercantile approach. If fact he was spiritually isolated and acquired a kind of a joker's mask as a defence mechanism. He was speaking in parabolas and one had to decipher the real meaning of his utterances which at times were extremely profound. But what did betray the artist were his paintings. There was nothing of the jester that he chose to project as his public image. Mental agility, depth, philosophical conceptualism reveal his true nature as a thinker and a serious observer. His artistic colleagues knew that. There was a saying among them "When the Lord anointed us artists for our profession, He poured a whole cup of oil on Tolya's head".</p>
<p>One can understand Zverev better if we trace his life back from his very birth. It is a very sad story. He was born in a village. His grandfather was a <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_icons.html" title="Russian icons">Russian icons</a> painter. Apparently Anatoly inherited the gift from him. Zverev's father was a war invalid and died when Tolya was a little boy, leaving a widow with three small children. His mother was a charwoman and tried to support her family by doing hard physical labour. They barely survived through <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>. Anatoly's childhood memories were: hunger, rats and cold. The first day when he came to school he shocked everybody as he was wearing two different shoes. His mother could not afford to buy shoes for her children. He started helping his mother to make some money very early on. His first job was in a recreational park, he painted fences and boards. Once he asked permission to paint some scene from a fairy tale for children and surprised everybody.</p>
<p>He was noticed by a certain art lover Rumnev who immediately introduced the young lad to a famous art collector <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Costakis_75e8.html" title="George Costakis">George Costakis</a> who said that Anatoly was "one of the most talented artists in Soviet Russia... a unique phenomenon". Costakis's collection of <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_avant-garde.html" title="Russian avant-garde">Russian avant-garde</a> art has been shown in major museums and galleries all over the world. Whenever someone of importance visited Russia he had the privilege of visit Costakis's apartment to view the paintings.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say that <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Kennedy_cde1.html" title="Robert Kennedy">Robert Kennedy</a> spending a day in this place. So Anatoly Zverev was ushered to this Temple of Fine Arts and his artist's career started at once. Meanwhile he was fired from the Recreational Park because the Director saw him using a mop for his paintings "against the regulations" was his verdict.</p>
<p>These two events were symbolic of the course of Anatoly's life. On one hand the Director of the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Museum_of_Modern_Art_08fc.html" title="Museum of Modern Art">Museum of Modern Art</a> in America bought his paintings, on the other hand, harassment, abuse and prosecution from Soviet officials and especially security organs. His first Fairytale paintings in the Recreational Park led him to the world prominence, while his real everyday life was more of a horror story.</p>
<p>All these circumstances, his childhood, weak health, Cinderella career without a happy ending, caused psychological withdrawal, a sense of insecurity and mental instability. His Western promoters sometimes did him a bad turn. For example <a href="../../../l/i/f/LIFE_5ecd.html" title="LIFE">LIFE</a> Magazine published two portraits by two painters, who to their mind, were most representative of Russian Arts of the period: it was Serov, an official Soviet icon and Zverev, an underground <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_avant-garde.html" title="Russian avant-garde">Russian avant-garde</a> artist of <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Nonconformist_Art_2c83.html" title="Soviet Nonconformist Art">Soviet Nonconformist Art</a>. Serov's portrait of Lenin's and Zverev's selfportrait were associated by many with an eternal Biblical struggle of Satan and Saviour. When <a href="../../../k/h/r/Khrushev.html" title="Khrushev">Khrushev</a> learned about the publication he was outraged and forbade all contacts with Western visitors, closed down all semi legal exhibitions. And of course Zverev was the main target of his outrage. Tolya's life became intolerable, he had to hide, struggling for a piece of bread. From time to time he disappeared and the rumours of his death began to spread about <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moscow.html" title="Moscow">Moscow</a>. Each time the rumours were not justified. "They have stumbled on me again" he used to say. He never complained, he made jokes: "I am not a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist.html" title="Communist">communist</a>, I am a harmonist", which was a play of words.</p>
<p>Thousands and thousands gathered at his funeral in 1986 to pay their last respects. After his death there was a major retrospective exhibition for several months in the major art museum of Moscow. They had to extend the exhibition as people were queuing up to get inside from early morning till late night every day.</p>
