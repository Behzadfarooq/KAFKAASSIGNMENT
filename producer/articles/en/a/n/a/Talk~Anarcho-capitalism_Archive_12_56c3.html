<h2><span class="mw-headline">Corporations &amp; Limited Liability</span></h2>
<p>In the Individual Anarchist section, I going to delete the following bullet point:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both oppose the existence of corporations, as they shield individuals from liability.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm an anarcho-capitalist, and I have nothing against corporations (unless they receive some kind of special privilege or subsidy from a State), nor against limited liability. To me, a corporation is just another voluntary organization, like a commune or a partnership, that happens to be owned via "joint-stock" arrangements. As for limited liability, this is a reasonable and voluntary arrangement whereby passive (non-decision-making) owners reduce risk. Why should a shareholder lose his house (rather than only the value of his shares) when a CEO does something criminal? Of course, limited liability shouldn't apply to the criminal. A standard home loan is usually a limited liability contract. If the homeowner defaults he loses at most the home, even if the amount owed is more than the value of the home. At any rate, in a free society I'd expect some/most private courts to support limited liability, and even now anyone can set up a limited liability entity ("virtual corporation) in cyberspace simply by staying anonymous. --<a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 04:11, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You can't do original research on wikipedia Hogeye. I'm sure you can find some prominent anarcho-capitalists who agree with your notion, it sounds familiar to me, so please do so and referance them and then the deletion would be fine. Your arguments, interesting as they may be, only count if they happen to be arguments used by a significant portion of other anarcho-capitalists. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 05:58, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

How about the horse's mouth? Murray Rothbard in "Power and Market" <a href="http://www.mises.org/rothbard/mes/chap15d.asp#_ftn11" class="external text" title="http://www.mises.org/rothbard/mes/chap15d.asp#_ftn11" rel="nofollow">here in the chapter on triangular intervention</a>. "It should be clear from previous discussion, however, that corporations are not at all monopolistic privileges; they are free associations of individuals pooling their capital. On the purely free market, such men would simply announce to their creditors that their liability is limited to the capital specifically invested in the corporation, and that beyond this their personal funds are not liable for debts, as they would be under a partnership arrangement. It then rests with the sellers and lenders to this corporation to decide whether or not they will transact business with it. If they do, then they proceed at their own risk. Thus, the government does not grant corporations a privilege of limited liability; anything announced and freely contracted for in advance is a right of a free individual, not a special privilege. It is not necessary that governments grant charters to corporations."</p>
<p>Am I the only one who reads Rothbard?</p>
<p>Here's a mutualist blog (Kevin Carson?) agreeing: <a href="http://mutualist.blogspot.com/2005/05/corporations-state-capitalism-and.html" class="external free" title="http://mutualist.blogspot.com/2005/05/corporations-state-capitalism-and.html" rel="nofollow">http://mutualist.blogspot.com/2005/05/corporations-state-capitalism-and.html</a> "In fairness to corporations (words I never expected to write), I have to agree with Murray Rothbard that limited third-party liability against torts, while clearly an illegitimate grant of privilege, is of relatively minor significance compared to limited second-party liability against creditors; and the latter can be accomplished entirely by voluntary contract."</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>One point I should make here is that a corporation (under US law) is a different animal than Rothbard's formula (this might be another sidebar definition) in that the US legal formulation limits <b>all</b> liability, including the corp's actions with parties not part of a "contract" ie. you are limited in your ability to retaliate against corporate "aggression" (i.e. a company tears down your house by mistake, sells a fraudulent drug that results in death, absconds with your pension.) <a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESaswann_93bc.html" title="User:Saswann">Saswann</a> 12:08, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here's an excellent article by Gary North about limited liability - a simple and elegant exposition of the issue (where I got the home mortgage example from). Billy Bob sez check it out! <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/north/north317.html" class="external text" title="http://www.lewrockwell.com/north/north317.html" rel="nofollow">Limited Liability and the Right of Contract</a></p>

As for voluntary debts being limited to the corporation's assets; this is no problem since the creditor knows these limitations when he loans money. What about limited liability for torts or crimes? As mentioned, the person direclty responsible for a tort or crime is always liable; sometimes the employer (which is often a corporation) is also liable for the employee's actions, via respondeat superior. Who else should be responsible? In my view, those who cause the damage are responsible. Shareholders don't cause it any more than a bank who loans money to a company causes its employees to commit torts."</p>

<dd>Good. Now you can delete the statement, though I would recommend against it for two reasons. 1) removing content is generally frowned upon, the more accepted route would be to alter the statement to show that there is disagreement in this area, and tag on of your above quotes to show that some support corporations. Also, add part of the analysis you provided above for why and to what degree some capitalists support corporations while others do not. Unless of course your contention is that none of them do, in which case it could be deleted. 2) When a statement that many people believe is true is flat out delete, even if it turns out that it is false, it inevitably happens that later on a wiki reader will visit the page and put it back in, unaware of previous events. On the other hand, if a statement is given concerning the falseness of the general impression, or the divide surrouding it, that reader won't assume that the information isn't there. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 19:08, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For others doing research, here is a dynamite bio (3 parts in pdf) of Gustav de Molinari, with the scoop on how his "friends of liberty" buddies (Bastiat et al) reacted to his "Production of Security" essay when he presented it to the econ club.</p>

<p>Here are some links where you can find "The Production of Security" and "Soirées on the Rue Saint-Lazare." The latter is a conversation between a socialist, a conservative, and an economist. (The economist being the anarchist.) Good stuff!</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Def is POV</span></h3>
<p>The description is POV:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anarcho-Capitalism is a branch of libertarian political philosophy which calls for a free market, private property, and a society without a state. Anarcho-capitalists favor a completely private system of law and order based on common law and explicit contract.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Anarcho-Capitalism is not neccessarly a libertarian philosophy. (like Friedman)</li>
<li>It's not necessarily political.</li>
<li>The term private property is also indeterminate for ancaps, example: land</li>
<li>State is no problem for me as ancap. The problem is that I must take part.</li>
<li>Why should I favor a system of common law? This is nonsense.</li>
</ol>
<p>I prefer</p>
<ul>
<li>The term <b>Anarcho-Capitalism</b> is used by people who describe a philosophy of society with a <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_market.html" title="Free market">free market</a> and at least without coercion to partake in a state system. All Anarcho-capitalists refuse the force monopoly and favor a completely private system of law and order.

<dd>Hi there, Alfrem. I understand your points, but don't agree with some of them. But first may I suggest better wording for your definition?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The term <b>Anarcho-Capitalism</b> is used to describe a philosophy of society that has a <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_market.html" title="Free market">free market</a> and allows people to opt out of state systems. All anarcho-capitalists oppose the state's monopoly of force, and prefer completely private systems of law and order.

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>I'm sorry, I don't think that Alfrem's version is an improvement. I'll discuss some specific points below. I may choose to revert to an earlier version some time in the future. - <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Kraus</a><a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">e</a> 13:21, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Anarcho-Capitalism is not necessarily a libertarian philosophy.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Why is this? Are you from a part of the world where "libertarian" means "socialist"?

<dd>No. I am ancap. But I agree with Friedman that stateless order must not lead to libertarian results. --<a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlfrem_8a2b.html" title="User:Alfrem">Alfrem</a> 21:21, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>No. Libertarianism is a meta-ideology of an ideal. In this ideal (without social dilemmas, irrationality and market failures) Libertarianism is wonderful. And it is a desire to aim at idealism.

<dd>I disagree. Anarchism is by definition political, since it deals with the ethical aspect of power. Anarchism is the philosophy/belief that the State is unnecessary and oppressive, and should be abolished.
<dl>
<dd>This depends on your meaning what is "political". When I ignore the state and do my own things, this is not political in my view. Therefore, you cant decide what is political by defintion, so it is useless to say by definition. --<a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlfrem_8a2b.html" title="User:Alfrem">Alfrem</a> 21:21, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<p>"Libertarian" simply means "anti-authoritarian." I don't think we should cater to Alfrem's bizarre non-standard notion of libertarianism. Jeremy Sapienza &amp; Friedman do identify themselves as libertarians (small L). Now, if Alfrem had said that where he's from "libertarian" means "anti-statist socialist," I would have had some sympathy for his position. I still don't know exactly what he thinks "libertarian" means. Alfrem, have you looked at the "Ideology Map" in the article?

<p>Alfrem, will you please define what you mean by "libertarian"?

I'm really trying to understand what you mean. To me, <i>any</i> philosophy, belief, or position that favors less power for the State is libertarian.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">free market and unlimited private property rights</span></h3>
<p>Alfrem, traditional individualist anarchists and some classical liberals advocate a "free market" but don't believe individuals should be granted title to unused land. A landlord charging someone rent for land that he didn't have a choice of being born on is tantamount to being a government. He didn't agree to choose to have a landlord or not. Rent was imposed on him. That's basically the reasoning. So, it's arguable whether "unlimited private property rights" are consistent with a "free market." You could be right in your point, but in order to differentiate between other philosophies that say that advocate a free market, i think it makes sense to state explictly that there is there is no ethical limitation of private property in anarcho-capitalism. Besides, capitalism is defined as private ownership of the means of production with decisions being made in a free market. Just saying "free market" is not quite enough. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 20:17, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>But</i>, "unlimited" is vague and misleading. I.e. Some anarcho-capitalists believe that IP (intellectual property) is valid, other's that it is simply a monopoly enforced by State. So something like "neo-Lockean" may be better. There is still an ambiguity (sticky property permissable vs. sticky property only), but no need to open that can of worms in the intro. "Propertarian free-market" may be best. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 21:29, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<p><i>"This is the root of anarcho-capitalist property rights, and where they differ from collectivist forms of anarchisim."</i></p>
<p>I don't agree with this. Many collectivists believe in possession property, which was also presumably appropratiated originally. A bigger difference between anarcho-capitalism and anarcho-socialism is in the <b>abandonment criteria</b>. Broadly speaking, ancaps keep their property until and unless they consent to trade or gift it, while ansocs keep it only as long as they are using it.</p>
<p>I'm going to think about this and probably revamp this section, renamed "Property Theory" or some such. Maybe I'll include that property system comparison table:</p>

People will have the law system they pay for, and because of economic efficiency considerations resulting from individual's utility functions, such law will tend to be libertarian in nature but will differ from place to place and from agency to agency depending on the tastes of the people who buy the law. --<a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlfrem_8a2b.html" title="User:Alfrem">Alfrem</a> 30 June 2005 08:42 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>Too much generalization in this:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Anarcho-capitalist philosophy is based on self-ownership, an absolute right to private property, and a prohibition against the initiation of force against other persons or property. From this is derived a rejection of the state (an entity claiming a territorial monopoly on the use of force) and the principles of capitalism (allowing any voluntary transaction between any two parties.) Because of this embrace of capitalism, there is considerable tension between anarcho-capitalists and movements that see the rejection of capitalism as being just as fundamental to Anarchist philosophy as rejection of the state. Despite this tension, anarcho-capitalists see Individualist Anarchist thinkers such as Benjamin Tucker as extremely important in their own philosophy."</li>

As I said, the onus is on you to provide legitimate sources aside from your own personal feeling if you're doing something as drastic as deleting a whole paragraph that is "not completely wrong." <a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESaswann_93bc.html" title="User:Saswann">Saswann</a> 30 June 2005 12:04 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Alfrem, No. <b>You</b> can "fix" it with Friedmans economic view, <i>with proper references and citations.</i> You cannot randomly slash content and then do some hand-waving and say that you did it because you once read something that you thought disagreed with it. I have been very patient with you, but it seems that you are unwilling, or unable, to back up your assertions. I might point out that in Chapter 43 of Machinery of Freedom, David Friedman says: "One could describe most of this book as a utilitarian approach to libertarianism" You, my friend, should explain how someone who is allegedly <b>not</b> a libertarian would write a whole book on the economic principles of libertarianism.</dd>

<dd>Heh, you wrote POV! Friedman is of the ancap/market anarchist camp. And you must take it into consideration without generalization.

<dd>So your response to an opposing citation is a flat denial and a reassertion of your own personal view without any supporting facts. Alfrem, any possible point you might have had is completely lost under your refusal to follow any reasonable approximation of academic honesty. All you do is cite your personal feelings as fact and claim that anyone who disagrees with your own personal idiosyncrasies is the one pushing a POV. POV is not a magic word that makes everyone who doesn't think like you go away, nor is it a justification to slash content with no factual basis other than your own personal assertions. I've tried to be accommodating, since you seem to have some familiarity with the subject, and English does not seem to be your first language. However, it is apparent that trying to reason with you, or even trying to get some comprehensible explanation of your position, is a hopeless endeavour. All I can say is, I tried, and showed a lot more patience than was justified in your case. <a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESaswann_93bc.html" title="User:Saswann">Saswann</a> 30 June 2005 14:05 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes. If there is no infringement of the rights of other humans, if an action doesn't "negatively impact" the person or property of other humans, then it should not be prevented by other humans. IOW there is a <b>right</b> to do that action.</dd>

<dd>Well, to be exact, you need to replace "human" with "moral agent." We base individual rights on intelligence, not species. If an alien from Alpha Centari or a porpoise started talking to us and asserted individual rights, then they too would be a moral agent. But if you're talking about lower animals or plants or rocks, no these don't have any rights whatsoever. We derive rights from sentience, intelligence, and evidence of a moral faculty. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 4 July 2005 17:18 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Individualist anarchism</span></h2>
<p>While I agree with what you said in your edit summary, that there is no controversy over whether or not anarcho-capitalists referance individualists, I do not think that is what the text implied. There are two reasons I disagree with your edit of individualism.</p>
<p>First, there is some controversy over the -degree- to which anarcho-capitalists are influenced by individualists. Some anarcho-capitalists claim that this is a very large degree, other anarcho-capitalists claim that it is minimal, and some non-anarchists claim the the extent of influence doesn't go beyond surface arguments for the core of an ideology that they had already taken from anti-state liberals and libertarians.</p>
<p>Second, I think that begining the individualism section with the claim that there is significant influence, when this is really a subjective call, is already caching the later debate in the terms of the anarcho-capitalists. They can claim some influence, of course, that much is a matter of fact. But I think it goes a bit far to begin the individualism section with a claim as to the amount of that influence, whereas introducing it as controversial at the outset puts the reader in the mindset that what is written in this section needs to be weighed against the views of many different groups. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 8 July 2005 18:36 (UTC)</p>
