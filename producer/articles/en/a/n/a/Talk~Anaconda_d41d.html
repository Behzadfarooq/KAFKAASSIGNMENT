<p>Can someone at weight and cross section diameter information? A 10 meter snake thin like a string is not too scary.</p>
<p>Can someone add speed information. How fast can they move and attack?</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><i>I don't know the exact speed, but from videos I have seen on the Net constrictors in general seem to try to give the prey animal the impression that they are very sluggish and incapable of bursts of speed. The prey animal then seemingly concludes it has nothing to worry about since it can easily outrun the snake. The snake inches within striking distance then suddenly moves like lightening, far faster than one might expect, and it is all over for the prey. Check out films of constrictors feeding on the video sites and you'll see what I mean. My conclusion is that one wants to be careful getting even remotely close to a large one.</i></p>
<p><i>Larger anacondas apparently often hunt capybaras in the water so swimming speed is also a factor.</i> <i>FurnaldHall 07:39, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</i></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>I have added information on the derivation of the name. This can be checked by cross referencing with the OED, with Yule and with Tennant. 220.247.240.241 18:58, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Can someone confirm the maximum reported sizes mentioned? I am a bit sceptical of the claim of specimens over 10 meters long, or 35 feet long as it says elsewhere. Have these claims been verified? Those lengths seem to be more than the largest verified lengths for reticulated pythons, which doesn't seem right.</p>
<p>Are there any confirmed cases of them eating humans?</p>

<p>Someone should doublecheck the size comparisons to the Python. I think the Reticulated Python's supposed to be smaller while the Anaconda's supposed to be slightly shorter but much more massive. &lt;<a href="http://www.vpi.com/5vpibreeders/ReticulatedPython/ReticulatedPython.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.vpi.com/5vpibreeders/ReticulatedPython/ReticulatedPython.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.vpi.com/5vpibreeders/ReticulatedPython/ReticulatedPython.htm</a>&gt; [wink] 19 apr 2k6</p>
<p>Se the <a href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/content_pages/record.asp?recordid=51013" class="external text" title="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/content_pages/record.asp?recordid=51013" rel="nofollow">Guinness entry</a> for the python; the "heaviest snake" category wasn't featured on their website (but the "heaviest <a href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/content_pages/record.asp?recordid=53799" class="external text" title="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/content_pages/record.asp?recordid=53799" rel="nofollow">living</a> snake" was), so you'll have to check the books for the green anaconda's entry. I did put some details of the largest green anacondas on its <a href="../../../g/r/e/Talk%7EGreen_Anaconda_6734.html" title="Talk:Green Anaconda">discussion page</a>. But the weight estimates of the claimed 11.43 m (37 ft 7 in) Colombian specimen (rejected by Guinness, BTW) have completely ballooned up here. The estimate of 500 kg (1,102 lb) – or 1,000 lb (454 kg) – was given for this particular individual, not a smaller one. This article also uses an awful lot of space for size claims. It should be noted that the official maximum of 8.45 m (27 ft 9 in) is remarkable as it is – at least I haven't seen reliable reports of more than 7 m (23 ft) besides this. --<a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnshelm_%2777_7fb7.html" title="User:Anshelm '77">Anshelm '77</a> 19:20, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is it just me? I find the following paragraph a bit confusing:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The term 'Anaconda' is derived from the name of a <a href="../../../s/r/i/Sri_Lanka_9993.html" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lankan</a> snake (<a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinhala.html" title="Sinhala">Sinhala</a> <i>hena-kanda</i> or <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamil_language.html" title="Tamil language">Tamil</a> <i>anaik-konda</i>), the <a href="../../../r/e/t/Reticulated_Python_cd8a.html" title="Reticulated Python">Reticulated Python</a> (<i>python reticulatus</i>). The South American snake was mistakenly given the name. <i>cf</i> <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_English_Dictionary_872c.html" title="Oxford English Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Was it the name of a specific, individual snake from Sri Lanka (e.g.: someone named their pet snake "Anaconda"?), or a species/breed of snake? Also, what "South American" snake? Is there a breed of snake called a "South American Snake"? Or does the article refer to a type of snake that happens to live only in regions of South America?</p>
<p>I think the paragraph needs to be rewritten by someone who knows their stuff, because I'm totally confused. <a href="../../../c/p/a/User%7ECparker_63ee.html" title="User:Cparker">Cparker</a> 23:34, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>The largest known anaconda measured 10 meters (32.8 feet) long, but unverified reports of much larger snakes have occasionally been made. This is the famous Lamon-Dunn record, named for a geological survey expedition from 1944. The geologists who led the expedition found the gigantic snake by the water of the Orinoco river in East Venezuela. Together with a platoon of soldiers of the Farc they shot the dangerous snake</i></p>
<p>I find this unlikely because the FARC (The Colombian guerrilla) is in Colombia, and even if the cross the border to Venezuela, they wouldn't be on the EASTERN Side of the country almost near Suriname, but in the West Mountainous Venezuela.</p>

<p>There's a large article on <a href="http://www.cryptozoology.com/cryptids/anaconda.php" class="external text" title="http://www.cryptozoology.com/cryptids/anaconda.php" rel="nofollow">cryptozoology.com</a> about giant anacondas, and I think more could probably be added to the section that exists in this article (unless anyone was for making a seperate page for the giant anaconda?). There is also the photograph mentioned in that cryptozoology.com article, which I found again on a cryptozoology board and have uploaded to my photobucket so as not to steal their bandwidth. <a href="http://i51.photobucket.com/albums/f391/Ahavaicons/Random/snake.jpg" class="external text" title="http://i51.photobucket.com/albums/f391/Ahavaicons/Random/snake.jpg" rel="nofollow">The supposed giant anaconda</a>, and <a href="http://www.unexplained-mysteries.com/forum/lofiversion/index.php/t51112.html" class="external text" title="http://www.unexplained-mysteries.com/forum/lofiversion/index.php/t51112.html" rel="nofollow">the message board it was posted on</a>.

<p><br />
<i>The cryptozoology.com page is fairly disappointing. More "gee-whiz...what if" than biology. I used to live in Nepal for many years and occasionally ran into talk of tigers in the hills around Kathmandu and such like that seemed unlikely to be true for the period cited (then there's the Yetis....), so one should not automatically credit local populations' tales about larger-than-life snakes as being true, just becuse they are "Natives." This is stereotyping, not sound biology. That said, locals (including long-resident outside "explorers") are often quite knowledgeable about the local ecosystem so that some stories are true. One has to know the person and the context.</i></p>
<p><i>If there are extremely large snakes of the sizes mentioned, this suggests several remote possibilities:</i></p>
<p><i>-- The larger snakes are not common anacondas at all, but a separate, though possibly related, species. Likely they are rare. Conceivably they could be a relict population previously more common and adapted to feeding on now extinct larger fauna. Though they still survive they would be a fragile population. Unlikely, but possible.</i></p>
<p><i>--Another remote possibility is that they are reticulated pythons, accidentally introduced long ago, which have established themselves as an exotic population. In such a case they may have found an open niche, the nature of which favored evolution towards giantism, and the genes limiting growth, may somehow have been inactivated, particularly as in the Lion-Tiger offspring "Ligers." (This mechanism requires hybridization, an unlikely mechanism in this case.) This is, though conceivable and entertaining, again a very unlikely scenario.</i></p>
<p><i>-- Animals establishing themselves on islands, initially as exotics, tend to evolve rapidly into separate varieties or species if the population remains isolated. Often there is a rapid drift towards dwarfisn or giantism. Just as true islands are found in oceans, "virtual islands" can be found on land in the sense that there are isolated areas of habitat potentially suitable for a species but not populated with it because there are intervening barriers between this territory and the main territory of the species, preventing inmigration. Examples of a barrier may be a large river, a mountain range, or in the case of mountaintop adapted animals, intervening valleys. Climate change which fragments an earlier, more extensive continuous habitat into "islands" in which a species becomes isolated are common enough. In some of the "islands," the species goes extinct, leaving a potentially open niche if it ever migrates in again from other habitat areas. Though highly unlikely, it is again conceivable that the "giant" snakes are one of the anaconda species or conceivably a fertile hybrid group, that has colonized one or more of these isolated habitats, becoming a separate breeding population, and evolving towards giantism. This can occur in a relatively small area, with a very small population. It may be associated with a dwarfing in the same territory of another, usually larger, species, making the newly giant predator and newly dwarf prey a viable predator-prey combination in this one ecosystem, but not elsewhere. See Komodo dragons and their dwarfed deer prey as an example.</i></p>
<p><i>-- animal size within a species probably tends to follow a normal curve. Conceivably there are a few markedly larger than normal animals, possibly with physiological disturbance. If this is the explanation, there may be a further systemic reason reports are not commoner beyond the increasing rarity of individuals of great length from mere standard deviation effects. A study of commercial python hunters on Sumatra ( see abstract at [<a href="http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=1742391" class="external autonumber" title="http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=1742391" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>] )showed that they tend to kill mostly medium sized pythons, but rarely kill large breeding females though they would if they had the opportunity. It is hypothesized that the reason may be that the juvenile, smaller snakes tend to live close to humans, feeding heavily on commensal rats, while mature females are unable to subsist on prey this small and seek larger animals in areas more remote from humans and the hunters. This pattern, if it applies to anacondas as well, might account for the infrequent reports of the larger snakes. However, the extreme rarity of such reports makes this hypothesis an unlikely explanation, and biologists seeking to find breeding female anacondas in the wild for research studies seem to have had relatively little trouble locating them.</i></p>
<p><i>-- Though not exciting, the most likely explanation appears to be either outright fabrication which is then passed on to third parties and spreads; distortion or embellishment as information travels from person to person; or unintentional miscalculation of the snakes' length. A travel book describing an encounter with an eighty-foot monster snake "as-thick-as-a-barrel" and throwing up a wake like motorboat as it churns through the water will sell more copies than one that recounts the mundane shooting of a twelve foot specimen. I would never have believed that writers, who I personally perceive as morally far purer than other forms of humankind would distort facts like this, but as it happens I know a travel writer and ....um...he has admitted to me that he makes up all his stuff most of the time! Gasp! WHAT'S print coming too! He particularly likes situations where all the other people are dead as not only can there be no contradition, but also no libel case. My own father was a journalist, and while not this bad, I wouldn't trust a newspaper account without independent investigation, especially in small local newspapers in Latin America of the type where if an American wishes to disappear, for a consideration the paper will print a report of tourist XXX's sad death. You could even be eaten by a monster anaconda if you desire, though this is a fairly high profile choice. You not only get the press story but a death certificate, police report,a grave, and all the trimmings for a price. A really conniving writer could even plant a couple of false stories in these papers, complete with photoshopped photos then reproduce them as arm's length evidence in a book, but no writer would <b>EVER</b> do this....</i></p>
<p>All this said, I hope they exist and someone will make my day by obtaining documentary video proof of a population of 100 footers!</p>
<p>...And apologies for what is essentially stereotyping the rural Latin American press -- a series of comments not based on any real experience. FurnaldHall 09:04, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Do anacondas eat black caimans? == According to the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_caiman.html" title="Black caiman">black caiman</a> article, black caimans have no predators. But according to the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anaconda.html" title="Anaconda">anaconda</a> article, anacondas eat caimans. Anyone like to clear this up? <a href="../../../r/a/f/User%7ERaffles_mk_104d.html" title="User:Raffles mk">Raffles mk</a> 05:38, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Though subadult individuals of the black caiman may have been eaten from time to time, the anaconda usually preys upon its smaller cousin, the spectacled caiman.</p>
