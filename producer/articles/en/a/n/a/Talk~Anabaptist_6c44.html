<p>From a glance at the article and the discussions below this article seems to being written mainly by Anabaptists for Anabaptists. It seems full of positive POV. Secular and critical studies on Anabaptists seem to be missing. Could historians or other scholars with <i>no attachment to</i> Anabaptists balance this article with other POV's about Anabaptists so we see a representative article here? <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnacapa_ab96.html" title="User:Anacapa">Anacapa</a> 05:40, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I glanced at Britannica to see how they studied Anabaptists. Their article is much more readable and much more secular in tone with a much clearer flow of the history and of the distinctions between various Anabaptist groups. They also emphasis the vehemence, intransigence, and end of time beliefs of Anabaptists. They state that:
<blockquote>
<p>"The Anabaptists did not aim to reform the midieval church. They were determined instead to restore the institutions and spirit of the primitive church and were quite confident <i>that they were living at the end of all ages</i> (emphasis mine). They readily recognised in their leaders divinely summoned prophets and apostles, and all converts stood ready to give a full account of their faith before the magistrates. They often identified their suffering with that of the early Christian martyrs."</p>
</blockquote>
They also state that "Thomas Muntzer was among those (sometimes called 'spirituals') who emphasized that Anabaptists were living at the end of all ages". Clearly Anapbapists were radical <i>revolutionaries</i> rather than mere radical <i>reformers</i>, a distinction that needs to be made here.</dd>
</dl>
<p>It seems from reading the Wiki article that much real representation of Anapbaptism is missing here. It also seems relevant to study the doomsday or end of time aspects of Anabaptists since these beliefs are often found in <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mind_control.html" title="Mind control">Mind control</a> groups and since some doomsday group researchers use early Anabaptists as examples. Finally, it would be useful to see Anabaptists studied from a secular perspectives as we do other groups so NPOV balance is possible here. <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnacapa_ab96.html" title="User:Anacapa">Anacapa</a> 03:53, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Feel free to add more stuff about Anabaptists. However I would ask you to remember that Wikipedia is dedicated to the <i>neutral</i> point of view not the <i>secular</i> point of view. Also because a group felt it was 'living in the end times' does not mean they employed mind control techniques. Nor does being a revolutionary necessarily mean you are controlling people's minds.</p>
<p>Incidentally it's also a good idea to add new comments at the end of a talk page. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 04:19, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>DJ, I added this stuff here because it seems to fit the section title best. I will use end of page discussions for the ongoing/new stuff I do elsewhere. I wanted some of those 1.1 billion (see <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">religion</a>) irreligious people out there to see this before wading down through all the other religious content in these pages. <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnacapa_ab96.html" title="User:Anacapa">Anacapa</a> 07:52, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>DJ, No offense but I feel just as free to add stuff here as all the other (Anabaptists?) here do. I do not expect to give or take permission from you to edit as you see fit, either, but I hope we do discuss rather than war. As for neutral NPOV versus secular POV you are right. However when I see articles packed with religious POV (in a <i>general</i> readership encyclopedia) I have a right to balance that POV with secular sources to arrive at some NPOV balance. (I will also note this is not a religious encyclopedia for religious references yet these Anabaptist articles sometimes <i>read</i> that way). I suggest you glance at <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">religion</a> to see what others did with highly controversial and opposing POV's. In terms of mind control, please read what I said again. I made no <i>blanket</i> judgements about Anabaptists and mind control nor did I imply that 'revolutionary' has a connection to mind control. I do connect 'revolution' with 'extreme' however because revolutionaries intend to turn over the existing order rather just reform it. Early Anapbaptists seem to have been (from the Britannica quotes) similar to modern day Muslim primitive revolutionaries (eg Talibans) minus all the violence. I will do what I can so you don't get blindsided here but please don't make molehills into mountains with what I offer by assuming the worst without distinctions. <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnacapa_ab96.html" title="User:Anacapa">Anacapa</a> 07:48, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The current article does not give a fair view of the Anabaptists -- way too much is dwelt on the Zwickau Prophets, who are more of an anomaly in the Anabaptist movement, and hardly anything on the more "mainstream" Anabaptists. I will be doing some editing when I have the time to correct this, if it isn't done by then. --<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColemanyee_09d3.html" title="User:Colemanyee">Colemanyee</a> 06:40, 3 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Agreed! There is a definite need to rewrite this article in order to achieve a proper perspective of the Anabaptists. It reflects ideas commonly held in 1911, and fails to reflect a more balanced approach that almost 100 more years of study of the groups should yield. I had some ideas, but found it to be a headache to try and fix the article without almost totally rewriting it, so I haven't done anything. Any work you do will be needed and appreciated. - <a href="../../../r/l/v/User%7ERlvaughn_1973.html" title="User:Rlvaughn">Rlvaughn</a> 04:26, 4 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for the support. It is true that a rewrite may be inevitable, reluctant though we are. Perhaps we could start with a general outline and move on from there? --<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColemanyee_09d3.html" title="User:Colemanyee">Colemanyee</a> 05:54, 4 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I developed a rough outline with the intent of first rearranging the existing material within it, and then add new material. I don't mind adding, but really hate to do too much of a rewrite of an existing article. But the existing material is so different from the way I would approach the subject, I became discouraged and decided to put the idea of hold for awhile. Here is the working outline I developed:
<ul>
<li>Introductory paragraph</li>
<li>The Name "Anabaptist" (perhaps could be combined above, according to length)</li>
<li>Views of the origins of Anabaptists</li>
<li>Types of Anabaptists</li>
<li>Theology of the Anabaptists</li>
<li>Christology (since this is an area in which several leading Anabaptists differed)</li>
<li>Persecutions</li>
<li>Migrations</li>
<li>Anabaptists Today</li>
<li>The Anabaptist Heritage (or legacy; doctrines now held by many "non-Anabaptist" Christians)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>This is just my idea; if you can use it in any way, feel free. I also think Wesley's ideas, below, would fit well into this kind of format. - <a href="../../../r/l/v/User%7ERlvaughn_1973.html" title="User:Rlvaughn">Rlvaughn</a> 00:26, 5 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It would be good to list the families of denominations that descend from the Anabaptists. I think these are the Mennonites, the Amish, and possibly the Hutterites? Possibly compare with <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptists.html" title="Baptists">Baptists</a>, who were influenced by but not directly descended from the Anabaptists.</p>
<p>It would also be good to mention the <i>Martyr's Mirror</i>, as that has been a very influential publication. It says their persecution continued up until sometime in the late 1570's, I forget the date. Persecution caused migration to Russia and other parts of Europe, and of course they came to the United States as well. They're generally known as one (or two if you count Amish separately) of the "peace churches", along with the Quakers, and have generally been <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conscientious_objector.html" title="Conscientious objector">conscientious objectors</a> in the United States. --<a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesley_19bf.html" title="User:Wesley">Wesley</a></p>

<p>WARNING: This page is 32 kilobytes long; some browsers may have problems editing pages approaching or longer than 32kb. Please consider breaking the page into smaller sections.</p>

<dd>I broke <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theology_of_Anabaptism_7d9c.html" title="Theology of Anabaptism">Theology of Anabaptism</a> out into a separate article (see Wetman comments below) to reduce the length (based on the 32kb warning), but have now added information on <i>Types of Anabaptists</i> and <i>Anabaptists Today</i>, which has brought it back to about 31kb. So I'm still looking for suggestions on which parts will best "stand alone" as separate articles (I felt Theology could certainly do that). - <a href="../../../r/l/v/User%7ERlvaughn_1973.html" title="User:Rlvaughn">Rlvaughn</a> 02:44, 16 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think it would be good to include at least a summary of the theology, with details in its own article. The first items I would put into separate articles would be the <i>Zwickau prophets and the Peasants' War</i> and the <i>Münster Rebellion</i> -- a summary would suffice. If that's not enough, I would move the <i>Origins</i> next. I feel that the <i>Forerunners</i> section may be too detailed for the current article. Hope this helps. --<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColemanyee_09d3.html" title="User:Colemanyee">Colemanyee</a> 08:18, 16 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I moved most of the Zwickau prophets material to <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peasants%27_War_2542.html" title="Peasants' War">Peasants' War</a> (which article already existed), and created an article on the <a href="../../../m/%C3%BC/n/M%C3%BCnster_Rebellion_eb08.html" title="Münster Rebellion">Münster Rebellion</a> with material moved from the article. Also added back a small general paragraph on theology.

<p>Removing the "theology" section from the entry <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anabaptist.html" title="Anabaptist">Anabaptist</a> is rather like removing the "article of clothing" section from <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hat.html" title="Hat">Hat</a>.

<p>I wonder whether it deserves a mention that the Anabaptist movement has been historically fragmented in part due to the lack of a central church authority. By rejecting the authority of the Pope and embracing the priesthood of believers, the floodgates opened for each congregation to interpret the Bible differently, and for a congregation to split in two whenever its members had a theological dispute. At least, that is my general impression of how Anabaptists have behaved. Is this accurate and/or important?

<dd>I think this definitely deserves mention in the article. Among Mennonites and Amish there are possible hundreds of different small conferences that have broken away over issues as small as whether to use hooks and eyes or buttons for clothing. The low level of hierarchy that Mennonites do have - bishops, has probably exacerbated this divide. Bishops traditionally oversee a number of churches and when they disagree with each other, they may very well split off from each other and take the congregations in their charge with them. Indeed, this is essentially how the Amish church started, breaking away from the Mennonites (see <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amish.html#history" title="Amish">Amish#history</a>). The <a href="../../../n/e/b/Nebraska_Amish_3e71.html" title="Nebraska Amish">Nebraska Amish</a>, <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swartzendruber_Amish_5e20.html" title="Swartzendruber Amish">Swartzendruber Amish</a>, <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Order_Amish_0f41.html" title="Old Order Amish">Old Order Amish</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beachy_Amish_bc20.html" title="Beachy Amish">Beachy Amish</a> are examples of this tradition continuing within the Amish church. Among Mennonite the number of differenc groups is probably even higher. The largest two being Mennonite Church USA<a href="http://www.mennoniteusa.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mennoniteusa.org/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and Mennonite Church Canada<a href="http://www.mennonitechurch.ca/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mennonitechurch.ca/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, the result of a recent reunification between the General Conference Mennonite Church and the Mennonite Church.</dd>

<p>Under the heading "Anabaptists Today", I returned the wording in this sentence - "The Anabaptist doctrine - that men must personally, volitionally, and consciously relate to God - is the doctrine of Evangelical Protestantism..." - from "people" to "men". I did it for the following reasons: (1) "Men" in the English language (regardless of what some people may wish) still, in the right context, has the meaning of "the human race"; (2) "Men" is in line with the wording of historic Anabaptist statements of faith; and (3) "People" is somewhat ambiguous, usually having the connotation more of human beings in general rather than the entire human race. If "men" just cannot be tolerated by some, perhaps we should insert "human race" or something like that. - <a href="../../../r/l/v/User%7ERlvaughn_1973.html" title="User:Rlvaughn">Rlvaughn</a> 23:11, 11 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article falsely claims that Anabaptists were part of the radical reformation, however the reformists themselves even claim that Anabaptists had no part in it. <b>"All Anabaptists and rebaptized persons, male or female, of mature age, shall be judged and brought from natural life to death, by fire, sword or otherwise, as may befit the persons, without preceeding trial by spiritual judges."</b> See how they explicitly specify that the Anabaptists were totally independent of the reformation.

<dd>You are making a lot of false assumptions. The Radical Reformation was not a controlled movement with a defined leader, as was the case with the Lutheran or Reformed movements, nor was the reformation as a whole controlled and defined. The Anabaptists were also not a cohesive movement, ranging from <a href="../../../m/%C3%BC/n/M%C3%BCnster_Rebellion_eb08.html" title="Münster Rebellion">Munsterites</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batenburgers.html" title="Batenburgers">Batenburgers</a> to what eventually became <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mennonites.html" title="Mennonites">Mennonites</a>, <a href="../../../h/u/t/Hutterites.html" title="Hutterites">Hutterites</a>, and <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amish.html" title="Amish">Amish</a>. Secondly, pointing out that other branches of the reformation did not consider the Anabaptists part of theirs does not mean that the Anabaptists were not a reformation movement. You are confusing the categories we use now to help explain things with the way things were then.</dd>

For those of us unfamiliar with the term, it's really important to clarify well that they were the ones baptising adults, not the critics of it.

<p>It was easier to burn Anabaptists than to refute their arguments, and contemporary writers were struck with the intrepidity and number of their <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martyrs.html" title="Martyrs">martyrs</a>. Thus <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanislaus_Hosius_32b9.html" title="Stanislaus Hosius">Stanislaus Hosius</a> (1504-1579), a Polish cardinal and bishop of Warmie, wrote (<i>Opera,</i> Venice, 1573, p. 202):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"They are far readier than followers of Luther and Zwingli to meet death, and bear the harshest tortures for their faith. For they run to suffer punishments, no matter how horrible, as if to a banquet; so that if you take that as a test either of the truth of doctrine or of their certitude of grace, you would easily conclude that in no other sect is to be found a faith so true or grace so certain. But as Paul wrote:"Even if I give my body to be burned and have not charity, it avails me naught." [This next quote must be from a previous editor; it's not from the NT.] But he has not charity who divides the unity… He cannot be a martyr who is not in the Church".</p>

<dd>Lee's work is a response to Verduin's <i>The Reformers and their Stepchildren</i>, and is representative of a Reformed view against Anabaptism. But its polemical nature leaves some question as to its objectivity. Quotes are often shortened for effect rather than concision (e.g., writing of the London Confession: "<i>it was subtitled: Confession of Faith of those churches which are commonly...called 'Anabaptist'.</i>" instead of, "<i>Confession of Faith of those churches which are commonly, though falsely, called 'Anabaptist'.</i>"), he renders highly suspect interpretations as connecting single immersion with unitarianism ("Such Anabaptists as were trinitarian, generally did so by pouring. Unitarian Anabaptists, however, did so largely by a novel single submersion."), and resorts to the old method of using the excesses of a minority to denigrate the entire movement (e.g., polygamy).</dd>

<p>I added a 'See also' link to the Mind control article because Anabaptist faith confessions are full of what some see as Mind control statements. Researcher Caldiani in his social science text <i>Influence</i> mentions early Anabaptists as a spectactularly effective doomsday group/cult using false reasoning with what he calls 'social proof' to gain converts against all evidence. The "One true" church links on the Mind Control article also use Anabaptists examples from orthodox Old Order Mennonites. As this ostensibly Mind Control theology forms the very basis of Anabaptist faith confessions and as early Anabapists have been used as examples of mind control groups, I insist on its inclusion here. It is clear that one need not burn anyone to refute these arguments. Please discuss this with NPOV balance or I will call a POV check on the entire article. <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnacapa_ab96.html" title="User:Anacapa">Anacapa</a> 02:03, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Anacapa, what you wrote above is extreme to say the least. Firstly mind control is a process, not a statement. I don't see how a statement of principle can be an example of mind control, any more than a soldier taking an oath of allegience to his country is. I may be wrong; if so you shoudl explan how. You wrote that 'some see' the faith confessions as mind control statements; maybe you should explain what statements these are and who sees them.</dd>

<dd>Those who face Mennonite/Amish/Hutterite shunning know how extreme this is in reality. Mind control is a process, with content, and with a context. Hitler used false statements along with a process and a context to control the minds of a whole nation. I suggest you compare the Shliethiem confession text with Chapter Six of Rape of the Mind (link in Mind Control) to gain an understanding of how Anabaptist ONE (pure, true or whatever) statements match those used by totalitarian states. I also suggest you review Lifton's criteria for mind control I know from personal experience that <i>orthodox</i> Mennonites meet most of those criteria. Another good source is Children Held Hostage by Rivlin to see how orthodox Mennonite/Amish mind control is used in shunning to alienate children against parents and other relatives. Most secular historians I read who reference Anabaptists call them <i>radical</i> reformers and often mention extremes in ideology or conduct. Hope that helps. <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnacapa_ab96.html" title="User:Anacapa">Anacapa</a> 05:11, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Secondly by creating these links you look as if you are trying to nake some sort of statements about all Anabaptists. Even if you could show that some early Anabaptists practiced 'mind control', making such a link is obviously prejudicial unless you can show that it applies to Anabaptists in general. I'm pretty certain it doesn't. Anabaptists include a huge range of beliefs, and I would be exceptionally surprised if more than a tiny minority could be accused of any form of mind control. The onus is, I belive, on you to show that this link is a valid and neutral one.</dd>

<dd>No apology necessary. I see you haven't been contributing long, assuming this is your first username, and there are a lot of concepts that you learn as you go. I haven't really been at it that much longer, but that you are working through ideas on the talk pages puts you off to a good start. As far as the other article goes, I didn't know it existed, either, until you mentioned it and I decided to check. I found that it wasn't linked in this article like it should have been, so I made some minor adjustments <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anabaptist&amp;diff=66388992&amp;oldid=66388843" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anabaptist&amp;diff=66388992&amp;oldid=66388843" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anabaptist&amp;diff=66389406&amp;oldid=66388992" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anabaptist&amp;diff=66389406&amp;oldid=66388992" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. <a href="../../../s/x/e/User%7ESxeptomaniac_2337.html" title="User:Sxeptomaniac">Sxeptomaniac</a> 21:08, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It seems that <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethical_consumerism.html" title="Ethical consumerism">ethical consumerism</a> has its roots in Anabaptism, at least according to <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethical_consumerism.html#Global_morality.3F" title="Ethical consumerism">this section</a>, which claims that it is based on the Anabaptist principle "that one must accept all personal moral and spiritual liability of all harms done at any distance in space or time to anyone by one's own choices". Unfortunately, it is a bit vague as to the nature of this principle and doesn't provide a reference.

<p>Perhaps someone should clarify that while Quakers are an Historic Peace Church, they do not descend from the same line of historical Christianity as the Anabaptists, and should not be considered Anabaptists. Theologically and historically, Quakers descend from English Puritanism, not from Anabaptism. The Historic Peace Churches are not necessarily Anabptist in origin.</p>

<p>It seems rather "iffy" to include Baptists in the list of modern Anabaptist denominations. Baptists, as known to-day in the US, are spiritual descendants of the English Baptsists of the 17th Century. While some English Baptists spent time in the Netherlands, coming under the influence of some Anabaptist/Mennonite ideas, they (like the Quakers) didn't descend from the same line of historical Christianity as the Anabaptists. Moreover, most Baptists in the US have a very strong Calvinist influence (for a variety of reasons at different times in their history). Like the Quakers, Baptists descend from English Puritanism. See the Wiki article about the Baptists.</p>
<p>I agree with you. -- <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreeradster_be83.html" title="User:Freeradster">freeradster</a> 02:20, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;Genealogists are also indebted to the Anabaptists, because Anabaptism was part of the cause for Protestant churches adopting the confirmation service, and baptismal registers came into being.&gt;&gt; I dispute this. In fact the opposite is true. In England baptismal registers were made compulsory by Henry VIII when he founded the Church of England. It made general a practice already started by many Catholic monasteries. Early anabaptists did not generally record their baptisms and therefore genealogists find that anabaptists are particulary difficult areas of research. Therefore to say that "Genealogists are also indebted to the Anabaptists" is very misleading indeed. I have therefore removed this sentence.</p>

<p>Some things (presumably essential to an Anabaptist heritage) are listed. Here are 4 of them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Freedom of religion</li>
<li>Priesthood of all believers</li>
<li>Bible as the sole rule of faith and practice</li>
<li>Pacifism</li>
</ul>
<p>The fifth was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ordinances (instead of Sacraments)</li>
</ul>
<p>I removed the fifth, as it was a result of modernistic reductionist thinking, and had little or nothing to do with historical Anabaptism. My question is, are the other four even valid? They may be true for the Anabaptist's descendants (i.e. Mennonites, Amish), but the historical Anabaptists did not neccessarily agree on those four points. Here's a suggested list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Restoring primitive Christianity</li>
<li>A society reformation by <a href="../../../g/o/d/God%27s_Kingdom_2dc0.html" title="God's Kingdom">God's Kingdom</a></li>
<li>A rejection of <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infant_baptism.html" title="Infant baptism">infant baptism</a> and justification by faith alone</li>
<li>Dependence and faith in the Word of God, whether the cannonical Bible or private inspiration</li>
</ul>

<li><a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreeradster_be83.html" title="User:Freeradster">freeradster</a> Makes a good point. I second his proposition of removing the fifth supposed 'essential unifying tenets' of the Anabaptists. After all, the Anabaptists <b>did</b> have differences. Also, I would agree with <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreeradster_be83.html" title="User:Freeradster">freeradster</a>'s new suggested list, with the exception of keeping the 'Priesthood of all believers' item, or at least clarifying the point to his liking.
