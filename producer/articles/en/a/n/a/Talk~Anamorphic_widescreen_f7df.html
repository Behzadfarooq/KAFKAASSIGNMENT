<p>This sentence seems to have a problem:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Widescreen pictures on DVD are stored in a horizontally squeezed format, in order to maximize the available storage space, and not waste as much on storing the black letterboxing bars.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>My understanding of the MPEG is that, being a compressed format, there would be no overhead for "storing the black letterboxing bars." Large black areas that never change wouldn't require much, if any, space to express. I can imagine that it might have an effect on processing time, depending on how the codec is implemented. Is there an MPEG subject-matter expert on hand to weigh in on this? <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleduc_26ee.html" title="User:Cleduc">Cleduc</a> 3 July 2005 01:44 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't remember whether I wrote the above sentence, but it's mainly <i>pixels</i> that would be wasted, rather than bytes of encoded video. If you letterbox a 16:9 video to 4:3, only about 75% of the vertical resolution actually contains picture. Encoding such a video to DVD, you'd be wasting 25% of your pixels on blackness, when they could be used for enhanced picture resolution. It's analogous to the first illustration, when 25% of the film surface is "wasted". I'll fix the sentence. -- <a href="../../../w/a/p/User%7EWapcaplet_7f49.html" title="User:Wapcaplet">Wapcaplet</a> 3 July 2005 02:50 (UTC)</p>
<p>This discussion is probably beyond the scope of this article as we cannot influence the way commercial DVDs are being produced. To my understanding pixels would only be wasted if the target display has a higher resolution than PAL/NTSC and will upsample the picture. If the display is only capable of 720 px horizontal resolution then the picture simply has to be vertically downsampled again. And since the whole space of the data medium is being used anyways (as Cleduc noted) the 25% of "extra pixels" will take away bits from the rest of the stream decreasing its quality.<br />
I see anamorphic MPEG-2 DVDs heavily influenced by the technology of analogue storage and transmission of the past, similar to the still used interlaced frame format. I mean why would there be any need to decode <i>and</i> resample the picture afterwards if a stream of the right resolution can be created in the first place without any need to do resizing? The specification of DVD might have been kept simple by allowing only a fixed number of resolutions (PAL/NTSC and fractions of them) but this is not a physical limitation of video adapters or the data medium. But where's simplicity there if a post-decoding process is required?<br /></p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Anamorphic widescreen DVDs store a stretched picture</i><br /></dd>
</dl>
<p>It's worth to note that no quality will be gained if this stretching is digital from a 720*405 source. The footage must originally have 576 or more pixels of vertical resolution. (for PAL)<br /></p>

<p>This is incorrect as pixels are not used on NTSC signal, but lines of resolution. I have changed the sentence to reflect this:<br /></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Talk%7EAnamorphic_widescreen_f7df.html" title="Edit section: The use of &quot;horizontal&quot; and &quot;vertical&quot; causes confusion.">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The use of "horizontal" and "vertical" causes confusion.</span></h2>
<p>In the second paragraph of the article appears:</p>
<p>"To make full use of the available film, an anamorphic lens is used during recording; this lens effectively squeezes the picture horizontally so that (in the case of the common 2x anamorphosis lens) a frame twice as wide fills the available film area (Figure 2)."</p>
<p><br />
I am confused by the use of the words "horizontally" and the linked use of "wide". Take the first. To all English speakers everywhere the word "horizontal" means "in a left/right, or East/West" direction. As in "the surface of a liquid is always horizontal", or "lie down on the bed in a horizontal position". Yet, in Figures 1 and 2, the image is manifestly being squeezed in a <b>vertical</b> direction. That is, the "force" doing the squeezing acts in a <b>vertical</b> (up/down, North/South") direction, from the sky to the ground, as when you put a "Jack-in-the-box" toy back in his box by squeezing him vertically. The only explanation for this bizarre way of description is to consider the strip of film in the figures as having been turned round 90 degrees and thus shown vertically in the Figures (from your head and dangling on the floor), it being perhaps the normal practice in the film industry to view film laid out left to right, in which case a <b>film-maker</b> would consider Figure 1 as being squeezed horizontally. But that way of looking at it follows merely because of the way in which he was holding the film and totally without regard to the fact that the image (the landscape) as presented in Figures 1 &amp; 2 has undoubtedly been squeezed <b>vertically</b> (sky to ground). There can be no doubt about that. To state that such squeezing of the image, as you present it in the article to viewers of Wiki, is horizontal is incredibly confusing for non-experts trying to grasp the way in which the word "anamorphic" is used. People like me shooting widescreen video for DVD and TV display have no need of historical terms protruding from the age of film. I urge you to revise the use of these words in this article to make it more intelligible.</p>
<p>The beginning of the later section <b>DVD Video</b> may need amendment in the same way. The present wording "the player will send an anamorphic (<b>horizontally</b> squeezed) signal to the TV, which will compress the scanlines of the displayed image <b>vertically</b>&#160;!!! As it stands, this sentence is internally inconsistent and very confusing.</p>
<p>Steve Kirkby, 03/12/2006</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is somewhat confusing, especially since a vertically stretched image and a horizontally squeezed image may appear to be the same thing without appropriate reference.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In filmmaking, an anamorphic lens <i>horizontally</i> squeezes the image. There is no doubt about that - the vertical dimension remains unaffected while the horizontal field of view is expanded by the power of 2. This will, however, cause images which are not de-anamorphozed to look very thin, which the eye can mis-perceive as vertical stretching. However, the vertical dimension maintains itself while the horizontal is squeezed and unsqueezed. In other words, a 40 mm 2x anamorphic lens will have the same vertical field of view as a 40 mm spherical lens, but the horizontal field of view will be equivalent to a 20 mm spherical lens.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the case of DVD anamorphic compression - which is an entirely digital process involving pixels, not optics - the image is vertically stretched in order to maximize the frame resolution by not wasting vertical resolution on black bars. The picture is then digitally scaled back to its correct aspect ratio when it goes out to the TV. There is no change in the actual horizontal resolution - only the vertical has been recompressed. This should result in higher picture quality, because more vertical resolution is given to the frame image instead of the black bars.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The truth is that these are two totally different concepts which only share the property of anamorphism (image stretching), and it might be a good suggestion to split these into separate articles, as they do not really have anything to do with one another directly. <a href="../../../g/i/r/User%7EGirolamo_Savonarola_76cd.html" title="User:Girolamo Savonarola">Girolamo Savonarola</a> 01:09, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you. It seems clear now. Splitting the article in two is an excellent idea. The confusion seems to flow from what the eye perceives, as you mention. Squeezing or stretching an image horizontally has the same perceived effect respectively as stretching or squeezing it vertically. The confusion seems to lie in the actual, practical, historical (I am thinking of celluloid film here) way in which these alterations are made. In the video world the terms often used include (my definitions) "anamorphic image or clip: an image or video clip that is designed to be displayed in widescreen format but which is by default displayed in the 4:3 format unless the displaying device is instructed otherwise." "anamorphic flag: an item of data attached to or embedded in a video file used to instruct a displaying device to stretch the file's images from its 4:3 format to widescreen format". I often think that formal definitions of terms are not helpful in promoting <i>understanding</i>, being of more use to those who already understand the subject and are looking for guidance on the exact, expert, use of the term or to settle disputes. To promote understanding (that is, for newcomers) additional <i>descriptions</i> are better, especially those which use more words* and give examples, and also those which look at the matter from more than one angle as in the "definition" of software: "anything that you can drop on your foot"! an enlightening, additional, way of describing it which instantly lights the recipient's lamp of understanding. *May the patron saint of students protect them from the elegant brevity of an expert's description. Wiki does not fall into that trap.</p>

<dd>Well, for simplicity's sake, you can think of it from the perspective of which dimension is considered more flexible: in film projection, all films tend to be projected at a constant height - the variation in aspect ratio is created purely by the width of the image displayed. So you'd compress the image along the horizontal axis. In video, however, the immobility of the screen edges means that the image width is kept constant and the aspect ratio is created by the height of the image (hence letterboxing). Therefore you'd compress along the vertical axis. This is all assuming that you're trying to keep the original aspect ratio and resolution, so things like pan and scan or zooming the image on a widescreen TV don't count, since they lose information - which is what anamorphic DVDs try to avoid. <a href="../../../g/i/r/User%7EGirolamo_Savonarola_76cd.html" title="User:Girolamo Savonarola">Girolamo Savonarola</a> 16:36, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
