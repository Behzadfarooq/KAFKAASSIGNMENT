<p>This is getting very tedious. Anarcho-capitalism is an oxymoron. Anarchists have already debunked anarcho-capitalism as being a contradiction. You cannot have capitalism without the existence of the state. I will also add once again that no anarchist anthology that I know of includes articles by or about anarcho-capitalists. No anarchist bookstore that I've ever been into has contained any anarcho-capitalist books. Anarcho-capitalism is a nonsensical belief system promoted by a handful of people who don't understand anarchism OR capitalism. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuck0_00fb.html" title="User:Chuck0">Chuck0</a> 23:42, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I strongly agree with Chuck0. Having read a large number of books about anachism and by anarchist theorists, I've never come across the conflation of capitalist property systems with anarchism. It is a fringe view, rejected by the vast majority of self described anarchists as being incompatible with the philosophy. <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMostlyharmless_cd83.html" title="User:Mostlyharmless">Mostlyharmless</a> 04:56, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You've said here before that you can't have capitalism without the existence of the state. I've asked you before how you are defining capitalism, but didn't answer. How are you defining it? And how about anarcho-capitalists that call themselves "market anarchists"? Is market anarchism possible without a state? Is your dispute simply terminological?<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 16:09, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Isn't this discussion a little pointless? Surely whether or not anarcho-capitalism is anarchist or not is all a matter of definition.

<p>By the logic of Libertatia, above, any anarchist that isn't of the mutualist variety is not a real anarchist because he or she broke that original tradition. This would include the communist anarchists, the individualists, the collectivists, the Chrsitian anarchists, the anarcho-syndicalists, etc. I guess since Libertatia would probably not claim this then he just disproved his own argument. Anarcho-capitalism is right. No anarchist has to follow any tradition to claim that he is an anarchist. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnow_Shoes_e08d.html" title="User:Snow Shoes"><span style="background-color:#DDDDFF;"><font color="SeaGreen" face="Verdana">Snow</font><font color="MediumSlateBlue" face="Verdana">Shoes</font></span></a> <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnow_Shoes_6068.html" title="User talk:Snow Shoes"><sup><font color="RoyalBlue">talk here</font></sup></a> 22:00, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The non-mutualist versions of anarchism (like communist anarchism) continued the general critique of mutualism in new directions. They did not deny its basic critique of capitalism and property but rather developed them.

<dd>To add to what BlackFlag said, Communist and Collectivist Anarchists such as Kropotkin and Bakunin were heavily influenced by Proudhon.

<p>The thing with Anarchism is, (and a lot of "An"-Caps don't seem to be getting through their heads), that anarchism is a philosophy of totality. Not simply a poltiical philosophy. Anarchism is a philosophy that is opposed to hierarchy, authoritarianism, exploitation, coercion, and inequality in all areas of life. Political, economic, social, religious, cultural, organizationl, military, etc. It's not a simple opposition to the State but not an opposition to other types of authority, hierarchy and inequality. That's why many Anarchists get into arguments with An-Caps on this board because they are simply opposed to the State but are not opposed to most of the things that every other school of Anarchism (including Individualism and Mutualism) is opposed to. Being anti-State is not enough to make one an Anarchist any more than being dark-skinned is enough to make one a Black person. Either one of two things would have to happen: 1) Anarcho-Capitalists are going to have to share more traits with every other school of Anarchism than they already do if they want to be a non-controversial school of Anarchist thought; or 2) Anarchism will have to be radically redefined from the way it has been defined for the past 200+ to simply being an opposition to the State. <a href="../../../f/u/l/User%7EFull_Shunyata_bffa.html" title="User:Full Shunyata">Full Shunyata</a> 00:51, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Which I would really like to do. There are some typos, grammatical awkwardness, and also enough run-on sentences to stall Sacco and Vanzetti's legal defense fund.

I'm working on a big typo/grammar edit now. as far as re-organizing, that's a bit more than I would want to take on. It needs some better structure, though, just for clarity.

<p>Well, we're unprotected again, and no closer to a real solution to our persistent problems. There is obviously <i>some</i> support for the restructuring I've proposed, but no consensus. My thought is that all parties, including our readers, are best served by an end, to the extent it is possible, to all of the working at cross-purposes that we have been doing. I would like to see <i>well done</i> and <i>accurate</i> pages on Molinari as much as on Proudhon, Rothbard as much as Kropotkin or de Cleyre, etc. I'd like to see concise "criticism" sections throughout the anarchism pages. The rules of Wikipedia are not exactly an aid in creating solid, scholarly pages on subjects like anarchism which have not received all that much serious published attention. We need, I think, to adopt at least <i>some</i> of what I have proposed above to give ourselves and our readers a fighting chance at getting really high quality information. fwiw. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 20:02, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>At this point we really have to ask why anarcho-capitalism et al is folded into the article <i>because</i> of the gulf demonstrated by edit wars and comments. The problem is that anarcho-capitalism and other forms of right-anarchism are the <i>only</i> branches of anarchism with no strong historical commonalities. In other words, you have global left/postleft-anarchism on one hand, and you have a set of largely American political philosophies on the other. I can't see any way in which both of them could or should be a part of any detailed article without misleading the reader. And given the tone of the discussion and certain edits, it seems clear to me that the inclusion of right-anarchism in the core anarchism article is the result of an activist agenda in action.</p>
<p>This means that any edit has to refrain from somehow questioning the anarchist part of the right-anarchist designation, while denying an agenda whose intent is less to inform than to popularize and create the illusion of a broad, global political philosophy. AFAIAC, that means a short article on anarchism proper pointing to detailed, broad treatments of left and right-anarchism. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Shootingdice (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Shootingdice_7ae9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Shootingdice">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>And what? Youre obviously having your own activist agenda, to make sure right-anarchism is left forgotten and that your lovely left/postleft-anarchism is recognized as THE anarchism. You make me sick with your appeal to anarchism and to censorship at the same time! Anarcho-capitalism is presented under individualist anarchism, and critizied as well there! What you are running for sounds like control over the existence of a minority, a minority thats clearly just that, instead of developing, controlling your thoughts and getting at their philosophy by arguing against their arguments ...

<dd>Fjulle, "Anarcho"-Capitalism is listed under the Individalist Anarchism banner and criticized there as well because Anarcho-capitalists are the ones who claimed they are part of that tradition. Individualist Anarchists did not invite them under that banner, An-caps put themselves under it to give their philosophy an air of legitimacy as an Anarchist philosophy. That's why many an-caps on this board are fighting so hard to ride the coattails of that tradition, it's the only thing that gives them any ties to Anarchism other than the name of their tradition. Personally I think "Anarcho-Capitalists" are just Neoliberals who want to privatize the State functions along with everything else in the economy and so call themselves "Anarchists" simply because they claim to be against the State. But that's just me and I'm not here to push that POV on the article pages. I just wish others would do the same and stop pushing pro-capitalist and pro-an-cap POVs on pages. <a href="../../../f/u/l/User%7EFull_Shunyata_bffa.html" title="User:Full Shunyata">Full Shunyata</a> 00:44, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You don't speak for anarcho-capitalists. I care nothing about the "tradition." I don't want to be a part of the "tradition." I don't need to be part of a tradition to be an anarchist. I don't seek "legitimacy" from "anarcho"-commmunists. I don't care whether they think I'm a real anarchist or not, because I don't think they are real anarchists. But, the link between 19th century individualists anarchism is obvious. They are both "market anarchists." Both support the security functions of the state to be privatized. That's the definition of market anarchism. "According to market anarchism, all the fundamental institutions necessary for the market to function - money, police protection, and even justice - would themselves be for sale on the market."

<dd>"You don't speak for anarcho-capitalists." I know. Just like you don't speak for Tuckerites, Spoonerites and Mutualits. "I care nothing about the "tradition." I don't want to be a part of the "tradition."" I don't quite believe you here. If you don't care anything about tradition, why do you refuse to define socialism out of the "common" or "traditional" understanding as "state ownership"? Why are you unwilling to part from tradition or majority opinion (you being such an 'individalist' and all) on what "socialism" is? Why do you care so much about whether or not mutualists and individualists oppose the "past/traditional" or "current" definition of capitalism? "I don't seek "legitimacy" from "anarcho"-commmunists." Anarcho-Communists are not the only anarchists opposed to "Anarcho"-capitalism. If you haven't gotten that through your head yet, then you are very ignorant on Anarchist issues. Your whole thing about anyone who opposed "Anarcho"-Capitalism must be a communist anarchist or at least a social anarchist sounds very McCarthyite of you. Believe you me that I have Individualist and Mutualist Anarchists friends who are more opposed to "anarcho"-capitalism than I am. This isn't just a "communist" thing. "But, the link between 19th century individualists anarchism is obvious. They are both "market anarchists." And no one has ever denied such. But to be a market anarchist is not equivalent to supporting capitalism. Being a market system is not synonymous with being a capitalist system just as having a planned system is not synonymous with being a state socialist system. I've never argued that Individualists (non-capitalist) and Mutualists don't believe in markets. What I have argued is whether or not belief in markets makes them capitalists. I argue "No" because they have many differences with anarcho-capitalism (aside from the LTV, which some mutualists and individualists don't believe in) that are significant enough to make them non-capitalist or socialist. One being their belief in workers' self-management. And I know many who would agree although I'm sure you could pick some Individualist Anarchists who are more friendly towards "Anarcho"-capitlalism who would argue otherwise. <a href="../../../f/u/l/User%7EFull_Shunyata_bffa.html" title="User:Full Shunyata">Full Shunyata</a> 02:02, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You don't know how market anarchism is defined, obviously. Market anarchism is defined as a philosophy that supports the market itself providing police, armies, etc to protect the market. Modern individualists (anarcho-capitalists) and 19th century individualists who were confused by the labor theory of value both favor this. That's why they're both market anarchists. That's all it takes to be a market anarchism - to believe that the security functions of the state should be replaced with private institutions and private funding. Pro-capitalism or anti-capitalism has nothing to do with it.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 02:36, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"You don't know how market anarchism is defined, obviously." I like how when someone disagrees with you, you resort to snide remarks like "You don't know [insert X], obviously." As if you are the ultimate authority on all subjects and anything that disagrees with your narrow definitions is therefore, hitherto incorrect. I am an active and very well-educated Anarchist and I am completely familiar with what market anarchism is. I have 'Market Anarchist' friends in real life. "Market anarchism is defined as a philosophy that supports the market itself providing police, armies, etc to protect the market." Depends on who you talk to. I don't hear my Individualist and Mutualist friends saying stuff like that. The people I usually hear talking about such issues are Randites and Rothbarians. "Modern individualists (anarcho-capitalists)" So anti-capitalist Individualists today are less modern? Even as a non-Individualist Anarchist, I find the fact that you use "modern individualism" as a synonym for the capitalist school of anarchism to be very insulting. It's like equating being a social anarchist with being an anarcho-communist. "who were confused by the labor theory of value both favor this" Ha, you just can't accept that there is an anti-capitalist/non-capitalist branch of Individualism (which is arguably older), can you? The Individualist dissent against capitalism is far deeper than a petty LTV. Not all Individualists and Mutualists believe in the LTV. One of the key things that seperates them from capitalism, as I said before, is their belief in workers' self-management. But you are so deep into redefining those schools to include them under the banner of "anarcho-capitalism" that you don't really seem to know what they believe outside of your convenient revisions and selective quotes from Spooner and Labadie. "That's why they're both market anarchists. That's all it takes to be a market anarchism - to believe that the security functions of the state should be replaced with private institutions and private funding." I know, and I've never disagreed with this. Market Anarchism is a very vague term that includes different and sometimes contradictory schools. However, the definition of 'private property' is an issue of disagreement between "An"-caps and Individualists and Mutualists. "An"-caps define things like combs up to large businesses as "property" where as Indies and Mutualists define "property" as 'means of production' pretty much (similar to Marxists whom you despise). "An"-caps have no problem with one-man management or propertyless workers who don't own or have any control over their workplace where as Indies and Mutualists do have a problem with such. "Pro-capitalism or anti-capitalism has nothing to do with it." Support for the market is not enough to make one a capitalist. There are socialist forms of the market system just as there are non-laissez faire forms of capitalism such as Keynesianism and Fascism. You argue with anarchists on this discussion page who are Individualists (I suspect User:Libertatia is one) who obviously are not capitalists in any meaningful sense of the word. Perhaps instead of trying to lecture me, a very well-read and dedicated Anarchist (and one who fully supports "Anarchism Without Adjectives") on what market anarchism is, you should go meet and talk with some outside of selective texts and academia essays. I have non-cap Individualist and Mutualist friends (both casual and organizational) in real life and at infoshop meetings (in person) and online forums. Most of them are no more capitalism-friendly than I. <a href="../../../f/u/l/User%7EFull_Shunyata_bffa.html" title="User:Full Shunyata">Full Shunyata</a> 09:19, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To add to that, I also found this point from User:Anarcho-capitalism to be rather damning, "Market anarchism is defined as a philosophy that supports the market itself providing police, armies, etc to protect the market." That says it all right there. Mr. "Anarcho-capitalism" is not opposed to the functions of the State. He simply wants them to be privatized and carried out by private institutions. His "anarchism" amounts to simply being opposed to the State (but rejecting almost every other cornerstone of anarhcist philosophy such as egalitarianism) because he thinks the State carries out functions that private institutiions on the market should be doing instead. As long as private firms are the ones owning police and court systems throwing people in jail and waging army wars, and not that nasty old State, it's all good. That reminds me of an old anarchist proverb, "From the point of view of a worker, it doesn't matter whether the force oppressing them is a capitalist hammer or called the 'Hammer of the People' (state socialism). Oppression is oppression." Anarchists know, and "an"-caps need to get this idea through their head, that the State, like the market, is an ACTIVITY, not an ENTITY. Just because you don't call something a "state" does not make it any less so as long as it carries out the activities of a State. If it walks like a duck, if it talks like a duck, if it looks like a duck.........</dd>
<dd>Just for good measure, let's take a look at what privatized police forces owned by "the market" (actually private firms, not the market system as whole) do in reality as opposed to "anarcho-capitalist" theory:

<dd>"Anarchism means no government but it does not mean no laws and no coercion. This may seem paradoxical, but the paradox vanishes when the Anarchist definition of government is kept in view. Anarchists oppose government, not because they disbelieve in punishment of crime and resistance to aggression, but because they disbelieve in compulsory protection. Protection and taxation without consent is itself invasion; hence Anarchism favors a system of voluntary taxation and protection." (Victor Yarros) "[Anarchism] does not exclude prisons, officials, military, or other symbols of force. It merely demands that non-invasive men shall not be made the victims of such force. Anarchism is not the reign of love, but the reign of justice. It does not signify the abolition of force-symbols but the application of force to real invaders." (Benjamin Tucker) Some of what the State does is good (non-aggressive functions, such as protecting property and body from criminals,) some of what the State does it bad (aggression, including theft of property). Completely privatize what the State does that is good. That's market anarchism. "Anarcho"-communism provides no mechanism to protect people from criminals. But of course, that's because "anarcho"-communism is a philosophy of criminality itself. It's the anarcho-communists that the individualists need to be protected from, as well as from the State.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 18:30, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>""Anarchism means no government but it does not mean no laws and no coercion." I never said that Anarchism meas no laws. All anarchist societies had laws. But, Anarchism DOES mean an end to coercion. Coercion is the bitter mote of inequality and hierarchy which create authoritarianism. The basis of the State is coercion (specifically protection and governance). You should also know that we anarchists don't give a damn about dictionary definitions. The dictionary is not "academic" anywhere beyond the 7th grade, so I sure as hell won't confine myself to dictionary definitions. "Completely privatize what the State does that is good. That's market anarchism." Well, that's part of a specific market "anarchist" ideology called 'Anarcho-capitalism'. In Individualist and Mutualist Anarchism, militaries and police are different. They are owned by worker-owned cooperatives (and we can assume the workers at cooperatives live in the communties of the forces they own). But anyway, thank you for admitting what your 'anarchism' is all about. It's not "anarchism" at all, it's simply a form of Neoliberalism that wishes to privatize the State functions but doesn't fundamentallly disagree with them. You confirmed my beliefs that you and those like you are not Anarchists. You are simply Neoliberals who want to hand the State over to private capitalists. This is a perfect time to quote Donald Rooum. <i>"There are self-styled "anarcho-capitalists" (not to be confused with anarchists of any persuasion), who want the state abolished as a regulator of capitalism, and government handed over to capitalists."</i> <b>--Donald Rooum</b> "Anarcho"-communism provides no mechanism to protect people from criminals." You don't know jack about anarcho-communism, so you should really keep quiet about it until you learn more about it. Anarcho-communists believe in community-owned police and voluntary militaries rather than State or private militaries. Read up on the Ukranian anarchist military. "It's the anarcho-communists that the individualists need to be protected from, as well as from the State." Haha, more of your paranoid McCarthyism. Of course "anarcho"-capitalists need to protect themselves against worker revolutions. Bosses should be afraid of the workers they make money off of by selling the products of labor of their employees. That's why, when it comes to property, "anarhco"-capitalists are no different from state-enforced capitalists or Fascists. The only difference is who owns the militaries. Fascists use the State and 'an'-caps use privately-hired goons. That's it. I think it's apparent for all here to see that you are most definitely NOT an Anarchist. Unless anarchism can be reduced to the dictionary definition of simply being "anti-state" (although you are not anti-state, you just want to privatize it). But thanks again for breaking down and admitting your true motives. I appreciate it. Your strand of "anarchism" is simply an ideology that seeks to protect the privileges of management. For all your anti-Communist ranting, you are essentially not much different than Lenin when it comes to workplace organization. He too believed in one-man management in which workers are required to give themselves to their bosses. You can fool some people some of the time but not all the time. <a href="../../../f/u/l/User%7EFull_Shunyata_bffa.html" title="User:Full Shunyata">Full Shunyata</a> 00:57, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

It's aggressive coercion that is not. Defensive coercion is fine. "Anarcho"-communism is an aggressive philosophy that seeks to deprive individuals of the product of their labor and trade through aggressive coercion. Market anarchism seeks to protect non-thieves from "anarcho"-communists and the state. "One of the tests of any reform movement with regard to personal liberty is this: Will the movement prohibit or abolish private property? If it does, it is an enemy of liberty. For one of the most important criteria of freedom is the right to private property in the products of ones labor. State Socialists, Communists, Syndicalists and Communist-Anarchists deny private property."

<dd>"Anarchism means no government but it does not mean no laws and no coercion. This may seem paradoxical" Please stop arguing against a point I never made. I said that Anarchism means no state government, no coercion but still the existence of laws. The only part of your statement that I argued against was the coercion part. Coercion is the basis of hierarchy and statism. Coercion would cause some people to have to limit their freedom and submit to the will of other people. Thus, creating the basis for hierarchy and the State to arise again. As for the whole taxation thing, you are burrying yourself deeper and deeper showing how you are in no form an "anarchist". NO school of Anarchism (not even Individualist and Mutualist anarchism) call for taxes. Taxes are the income of the STATE. If taxes are being paid, that means they are being paid to a state-like entity. Like I said, the State is an ACTIVITY, not an ENTITY. You can call it a "private defense association" or whatever, but if it still acts like the state (collecting taxes, working at the behest of an elite group or individual above the people, etc.) IT'S A DAMN STATE. No matter what you call it. Just like you can put bunny ears on a dog and claim it's a rabbit, but it's still a damn dog. ""Anarcho"-communism is an aggressive philosophy that seeks to deprive individuals of the product of their labor and trade through aggressive coercion." I think you have it the other way around. "Anarcho"-capitalists are the ones who argue that if workers don't own their tools, they have no right to the product of labor. They have no problem with propertyless workers giving their liberty and products of labor to a private property-owner to be sold on the market. Anarcho-communists are against the idea of labor altogether. We don't believe in ownership, we believe in usership. Things should be controlled by whoever is using them at the time or by whoever things are being produced for. We don't believe in submitting our liberty to private capitalists, we like our individual freedom just fine, thank you. I don't want to give up my freedom to become a worker drone or become someone else's boss. "Market anarchism seeks to protect non-thieves from "anarcho"-communists and the state." Stop lumping "market anarchism" together. We've already established that 'market anarchism' is a vague term with various and contradictory philosophies (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Anarchism#What_is_.22Market_Anarchism.3F.22" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Anarchism#What_is_.22Market_Anarchism.3F.22" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Anarchism#What_is_.22Market_Anarchism.3F.22</a>). And we've also established the difference between Anarcho-Capitalism and Anarcho-Socialism. You sound plum ignorant and I'm sure many anarchists on this board are laughing at you. You argue with 'market anarchists' all the time here (like User:Libertatia and User:PhilLiberty) who are obviously not capitalists of any sort. Socialist Market Anarchism seeks to give control of the market to workers. "Anarcho"-capitalists are pro-management property thieves who want to hoard property and force the propertyless to work it for them so they can make money from their employees. Then protect the stolen property with their own private totalitarian state forces. "State Socialists, Communists, Syndicalists and Communist-Anarchists deny private property." We only oppose private ownership of things that are used for public production (such as means of production). We are not opposed to private ownership of things that people use to produce for themselves. In fact, we are opposed to all forms of ownership as a mythology. We believe in usage or possession (which can be social possession or private possession). I'm sorry, repeating "Anarcho"-capitalist propaganda will not save you from the fact that your ideology (or at least your particular brand of "Anarcho"-capitalism) is not anarchism and is quite authoritarian (if not totalitarian). You can repeat the same lines over and over until you turn blue in the face. It won't make them any more true. Quite frankly you're just making yourself look like a programmed robot. <a href="../../../f/u/l/User%7EFull_Shunyata_bffa.html" title="User:Full Shunyata">Full Shunyata</a> 01:54, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"Voluntary taxation" is simply a way of speaking - it's not to imply that it's actual taxation.

All it means is that instead of being taxed to protect our bodies and property, we voluntarily pay people to protect us." In other words a *dramatic music* STATE. That's exactly the same MO of state goverments. Which is one of the main reasons I'm very wary of "anarcho-capitalism". An-caps disagree with about 3/4 of the cornerstones of every other anarchist philosophy (such as non-coercion, egalitarianism, etc.) and have a reputatoin of being some of the most prominent defenders of Management against Labor. "That's market anarchism." That's one particular market 'anarchist' philosophy ("anarcho"-capitalism). The same can't be said for all market anarchist philosophies. Just like all social anarchist philosophies do not reject the concept of ownership like anarcho-communists do (anarcho-communism is the only social anarchist philosophy that rejects the concept of ownership). You shouldn't lump all market anarchist theories together just like you shouldn't lump all social anarchist theories together as "anarcho-communism". The anarchist world is bigger than that. Some market anarchist philosophies are market socialism while others are market capitalist. Some social anarchist theories are socialist while others are communist (yes, there is a difference). Some social anarchist theories even accept the market, there is a more recent form of anarchism that is a melding of Mutualism and Parecon.

<dd>No, support of private defense is not "just one particular market anarchist philsophy." It's all market anarchist philosophy, by definition. By definition, market anarchists support privately funded defense of person and property - what you're erroneously calling a state. A state taxes. If I ask you for money to protect you and your property, I'm not a state. If you don't want to purchase my services, fine - you just won't receive them then. Benjamin Tucker explained: ""[D]efense is a service like any other service; that it is labor both useful and desired, and therefore an economic commodity subject to the law of supply and demand; that in a free market this commodity would be furnished at the cost of production; that, competition prevailing, patronage would go to those who furnished the best article at the lowest price; that the production and sale of this commodity are now monopolized by the State; and that the State, like almost all monopolists, charges exorbitant prices." If you want to call voluntarily funded defense a "state" that's up to you. But it's not proper terminology. You need to realize that there is a difference between a business and a state.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 06:22, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Market Anarchism" doesn't mean "Anarcho-Capitalism." On the face of it, "Market Anarchism" would include all anarchist systems with primarily market economies, as opposed to anarchist systems with primarily gift economies, primarily communist economies, Parecon, etc. That would exclude anarcho-communism, not really categorize collectivism, and include early mutualism, later mutualism, geoanarchism, agorism, etc. The proponents of these models are often opponents of capitalism. Jacob Haller 02:17, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree. Market Anarchism is a vague category that includes all anarchist schools of thought that believe the market should be the economic system of anarchism. "Market Anarchism" spans all the way form 'Anarcho'-Capitalism to Anarcho-Socialism such as Individualist and Mutualist Anarchism. Some would even argue that Parecon, which is basically a modernized 21st century form of Collectivist Anarchism, is a type of market system. The thing is, there is no uniform agreement on what a market system should be like, so it can range from a capitalist market controlled by private owners, to a socialist market where independent propertied producers [laborers/workers] merge together to form employee-owned cooperative companies. If there is an article on market anarchism, it should include the various anarchist market philosophies. Some of them support capitalism, like "Anarcho"-Capitalists, Agorists and such. Others, such as Indies, Mutualists and some Green Anarchists, are opposed to capitalism and could be considered a stateless form of "market socialists". Capitalism does not have a monopoly (no pun intended) on the market system. <a href="../../../f/u/l/User%7EFull_Shunyata_bffa.html" title="User:Full Shunyata">Full Shunyata</a> 02:50, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Definition anarcho-capitalists use is just the normal everyday commonly-accepted mainstream definition: "an economic system characterized by private or corporation ownership of capital goods, by investments that are determined by private decision rather than by state control, and by prices, production, and the distribution of goods that are determined mainly in a free market." (Merriam-Webster, unabridged) It's the definition pretty much everybody uses today, including Randians.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 18:19, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I was just mentioning that we anarcho-capitalists use the mainstream definition of capitalism and as an example of such a definition I gave the definition from one of the most widely consulted dictionaries in the world.

<dd>Well, most capitalists do not believe that capitalism can be done without a State. And there isn't a consensus amongst capitalists on how exactly to achieve a "free market", let alone a "perfect market". Capitalists can range from European social democrats and Christian democrats to Keynesians, Neoliberals, Neoconservatives, Libertarians and 'Anarcho'-Capitalists. I don't think they all have the same view of capitalism. Just like Marxists and Mutualists don't have the same concept of socialism and Marxist-Leninists and Anarcho-Communists don't have the same concept of communism. <a href="../../../f/u/l/User%7EFull_Shunyata_bffa.html" title="User:Full Shunyata">Full Shunyata</a> 05:42, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But capitalism is defined as a non-statist system. The means of production are owned privately, as opposed to by the state. And pricing, distribution, production is determined by the private sector rather than by the state. Most think you need a state (an entity that taxes) to protect people and their property. Individualists (market anarchists to be precise) think it can be done by the private sector. But, the definition is the same. It's a private system, as opposed to a state system.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 05:48, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A quick comment: it depends on your definition of "state." Even Merriam-Webster, which you seem to prefer as your chief academic resource, is ambiguous on the matter. Anarcho-capitalists attempt to slip by this by claiming that states, by definition, must <i>tax</i>. But, clearly, this is not a necessary part of the definition. If one were to employ your dictionary standard, then we have several definitions that do note bode well for anarcho-capitalists: "a body of persons constituting a special class in a society," "a politically organized body of people usually occupying a definite territory; especially&#160;: one that is sovereign," and so on. Most scholars, I would say, would call a "state" any institution whose monopoly on violence is widely regarded as legitimate. Any of these definitions would include the property owner. Thus, any system of ownership probably immediately implies the existence of some kind of state. Of course, a dictionary would not tell you that, because that's not what a dictionary is for. --AaronS 19:31, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And non-static systems cant work in relation with static systems? But today theres both capitalist companies and states all in one big mess, together. Id say thats a very much different definition on non-statism as an attribute to capitalism than the one your giving us, right? How come it is false, if you are right? If you add this line: ", which cannot function properly in relation with static systems." you got you view of capitalism, what, in your perspective, is the right definition.

<p>I think the following passage (in the Ancap section) should be removed. The most obvious reading is false, though less obvious readings are true. By putting "labor for labor" next to "value for value" this suggests that "labor for labor" contradicts "value for value." AFAIK, "labor for labor" simply means trading labor for labor, regardless of different amounts, just as "goods for goods" simply means trading goods for goods, regardless of different kinds. It can be extended to other barter as well as independent-currency trades. AFAIK, "value for value," depends on the sense of value, which may mean anything from immediate utility to replacement cost. I suspect most non-communist anarchists and non-communist libertarians (from collectivists though whomever) would support both "labor for labor" and "value for value" in some sense of each term.

<p>If the "utopian communism" to which Proudhon was objecting is in some sense "voluntary," it is not so in the same sense that the "voluntary communism" of the anarchist communists is supposed to be. That is, it is hard to interpret Cabet's communism as <i>libertarian</i>, which is what Tucker means when he draws the line.

<dd>No problem. I've scanned the piece (on another machine) and should be able to post it tomorrow. But I think you've misconstrued the issue for Tucker. There's no libertarian argument against <i>opposition</i>, nor against genuinely voluntary community of property, beyond the fact that it seems like a bad idea to some of us more market-inclined types. Those who have said that they would <i>enforce a ban</i> on private property are the compulsary communists. Tucker makes the connection between "compulsory communism" and "statecraft" explicit, and refers to Bismarck as his exemplar of compulsary communism. His counter-example is William Harrison Riley, who wrote, in the same issue, of a communism in which the "right to secede" would be recognized. Speculation about what percentage of contemporary anarchist communists recognize that right is OR, but most of them that I know explicitly acknowledge it. There aren't many Johann Mosts left around. More OR, but something to consider anyway: the "compulsary communism" most threatening in Tucker's time was probably Edward Bellamy's Nationalism or similar schemes.

<dd>From the same source: "As for the believers in voluntary Communism (of whom there are precious few), they are of necessity believers in the liberty to hold private property, for to pool one's possessions with those of others is nothing more or less than an exercise of proprietorship." Tucker is playing semantic games here, saying that all voluntary association is support for "private property." We can follow his argument, but we wouldn't all accept his terms. We know that "private property" is a loaded term. You have to make a guess what point Tucker thinks he's scoring here. Did Kropotkin refuse the "right to secede" or just the term "private property"? In any event, this nicely shows that Tucker, even when he was most frustrated with the communists, nevertheless maintained the <i>voluntary communism</i> category in his thinking. What a formula: <i>voluntary communism is the exercise of private property rights</i>. I think we call that "flame-bait" now. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 21:46, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Private property can mean two things: property owned by the individual or property owned by anyone but the state (the latter meaning is common in popular usage). The physical belongings of corporations are collectively owned, but they're considered private property too in the latter sense. So, Tucker seems to be switching his definition of the term late in life to the sense of all that is owned but not owned by the state.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 22:52, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think Tucker is actually following a fairly conventional line here. If I have complete control over my property, then I can combine it voluntarily with yours just as legitimately as I can destroy it (or use and abuse it in any other way.) The problem is that there are lots of understandings of "property" or "possession" quite different from Tucker's under which a genuinely voluntary communism could occur, including the denial of "property" in any form. He wants to be able to claim that anyone who is really an anarchist simply <i>can't</i> oppose "private property." But he doesn't prove his point. The argument is interesting. Just yesterday, I was asking a non-anarchist communist how production and distribution decisions got made, <i>without recourse to central authority</i>, without using some sort of "market." But I acknowledged that I was allowing the notion of "market" a lot of breadth. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 23:22, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That makes more sense. I think that's in line with what he was saying. But I don't see any logical possibility of voluntary communism because they claim that the world's resources are owned by everyone in common. That's a basic premise of communism. If that's the case, then there is no right to private property because you would be stealing from humanity. I see no compatibility with individualism; they're in fundamental contradiction. The individualist conception is that the world's resources are not owned in common by everyone. Therefore, to take them as private property is not stealing. The only "voluntary communism" compatible with individualist anarchism would be a situation, like Tucker says, where a group of people pool their resources and at the same time acknowlege or allow a right to private property. They would have to allow a right of private property in order for them to allow us individualists to practice our system. So, truly voluntary communism has to acknowledge a right to private property. And, that's odd, because that would make them not communists. Any anarcho-communists who denies a right to private property cannot be a "voluntary communist." I don't know if this is exactly Tucker's point, but I think he would agree with me. <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 18:28, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The only thing necessary to voluntary communism is a <i>right to secede</i>, hopefully with pre-arranged conditions. This should be true according to almost any set of beliefs about property. If you believe in an absolute right to property, then it's clear that you can do anything with it, including pool it with others' property. In fact, the consistent propertarian may, somewhat ironically, have the easiest time justifying voluntary communism. For those who do not accept the justifications for that absolute sort of property, the associated problems don't become any more or less thorny in a community-of-property situation. Someone who doesn't believe there is any justification for "private property" can still enter into voluntary relations with others, who may or may not agree in that regard, as long as the right to secede is acknowledged. (As you know from earlier exchanges, I remain unconvinced by the standard justifications for absolute property, and find myself much closer to Proudhon's concern with the "aims" of the property relation. So I don't "believe in private property" in the sense that you do, but it doesn't make me a communist, nor does it prevent me from entering any sort of voluntary association—nor would it necessarily make much difference in our interactions. You might never know.) Anyway, Tucker, like Bakunin in the other quote, is most concerned with state communism. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 18:55, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As far as your support for "possession" that's not compatible with anarcho-capitalism at all; the two systems apparently cannot coexist. That says that if I'm not using something I purchased, or acquired through my labor, then you can come along take it and I would have no right to stop you. Would a you allow someone in your system to cecede, to choose to prevent others from taking the product of his labor and trade whether he's using it or not? If so, then you're not different from an anarcho-capitalist because as anarcho-capitalists recognizes a right for you and a group of others to practice such a system voluntarily. But, I don't think the reverse is true at all. Tucker, for example, did not accept a right of people to defend land they're worked for or purchased if they were not using it. That's why anarcho-capitalist is more anarchistic. Anarcho-capitalists will allow you, as well as communists to cede, but the reverse is not true. "Anarcho-capitalism" is in some ways a misnomer, because it's not at all saying that everything has to be capitalist. It just says that individuals have the right to practice free-market capitalism if they wish.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 19:32, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Tucker is in some sense simply not making a lot of sense. You and BlackFlag and I could decide to pool our resources with the right to secede from our "commune" made explicit. We would have, I suspect, three very different senses of what "rights to property" actually exist, but these would not in any way prevent us from entering the arrangement and successfully coexisting as long as it served our interests. If this is, as Tucker claimed, necessarily support for "private property," then it expands the notion to include understandings most advocates would disavow. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 22:31, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Tucker is making sense. If anarcho-communists acknowlege a right to cecede from an anarcho-communist system, to establish private property including in the means of production, then they acknowledge a right to private property. But, whowever heard of an "anarcho"-communist acknowledge that individuals do have such a right to private property? If there is such a creature, can he legitimately call himself a communist? I don't think so. Individualist anarchists (including anarcho-capitalists) acknowledge a right to commmunist and individualist property as long as it was acquired without coercion or fraud. Individualists acknowlege a right to "voluntary communism" if there is such a thing, but "anarcho"-communists do not acknowledge a right to voluntary private ownership of the means of production. Who is the real anarchist? It's the individualist. <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 19:01, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You seem to assume that communists are the sort of "creature" who will always force their beliefs on others. You also assume a much more uniform understanding of "property rights" among individualists than actually exists or has existed. All anarchists worthy of the name recognize rights to voluntary association. If you want to go play proprietor over there, in a non-invasive way, why would any anarchist object? Acknowledging your "right" to do any number of things, some of them foolish, doesn't imply any special sanction for those things. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 19:50, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

If any anarcho-communists acknowledges a right to cecede from an anarcho-communist system then he naturally acknowleges a right to free market capitalism.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 19:55, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You're the one who is always quick to claim that <i>anarchism</i> entails nothing but opposition to government. Now you seem to believe that "real anarchists" have to adopt your theory of property (and associated) "rights." If, "after the revolution," there are conflicts between communities with different property standards, I'm guessing anarcho-capitalists will be as likely to engage in invasive behavior as anarcho-communists. The rest of us have already come to terms to some extent with the fact that property "rights" are really just widely accepted <i>standards</i>. Tucker quite correctly recognizes that voluntary communism is possible, and then redefines "belief in private property" in a way that strict propertarians like yourself should find woefully inadequate, in order to score points against political enemies. It's a clever rhetorical move, but it's an absolutely horrible argument.

<dd>Let's get something straight. Anarchism is any philosophy that opposes the state, as far as what this article can claim is anarchism. That's my point with that. I am saying that not my or anyone else's POV should be pushed as to what is or isn't anarchism in the article. It's my personal belief that only anarcho-capitalism is true anarchism. "Anarcho"-communism and mutualism (in that it doesn't allow people to protect purchased land and houses from being taken when they're not using them) are authoritarian in my opinion. I am not going to assert my personal belief on what is or isn't real anarchism in the article. Ok then. Tucker does correctl reoganize that voluntary communism is "possible," but like he says there are few if any such voluntary communists. "Anarcho"-communists are actually not voluntary communists. They deny a right to private property. They deny that there is a right to private ownership of the means of production, for example. That means that there is no right for a group of people to "cecede" and partition out formerlly collectively owned means of production into private ownership. A right to cecede would be an acknowlegement of the right to free market capitalism.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 21:23, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry about the delay in posting this. Here's the Tucker piece:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two Kinds of Communism. We do not believe in communism in the economic sense of the word. To us it seems, for many reasons, an impossible and undesirable form of society. Proudhon described it accurately as well as epigrammatically when he called it the "religion of poverty." But it is not our special business to antagonize the voluntary communism vigorously pictured by W. H. Riley in another column. He, and those of his friends who agree with him, may attempt any associative experiment they please; Liberty will look on with interest and report results. It is compulsory communism of the Bismarckian stamp that we combat. It is the needle-gun socialism of Ferdinand Lassalle that we oppose. Statecraft is our enemy, whether it be that advocated by Jay Gould in the New York "Tribune," or that advocated by our good friend, W. G. H. Smart, in a note printed elsewhere in this journal,—a note, by the way, so good-humored, so straightforward, so utterly void of the circumlocution too frequently characteristic of Mr. Smart's newspaper articles, that we publish it with great pleasure. Space is lacking to meet his points now. Nevertheless, on misapprehension should be corrected immediately. We do not believe that any one can "stand alone." We do wish "social ties and guarantees." We wish all there are. We believe in human solidarity. We believe that the members of society are interdependent. We would preserve these interdependencies untrammelled and inviolate. But we have faith in the sufficiency of natural forces. Motives and good impulses aside, we have no sort of sympathy with those multitudinous groups of so-called socialists, of all colors, stripes, and propensities, with each its little scheme for bursting the bonds by which nature unites us and tying men and women together anew with artificial chains. None of them, whatever they may claim, believe in the unity of the race. All its members, in their opinion, need to be cemented into unity, and for this purpose each has his patent glue. They wish a manufactured solidarity; we are satisfied with the solidarity inherent in the universe. When Mr. Smart has whipped the Universe, "body, soul, and breeches," Liberty too will throw up the sponge.</p>

<p>And here's the Harrison piece he refers to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Communism vs. Commercialism The only society in which the rights of individuals will be respected will be a communistic society, in which the partnership will always be voluntary. Where the right to secede is not recognized—in a family, a state, or a federation of states—there exists subjection, slavery. All the frenzied babble about the rights of majorities to govern other than themselves must cease. Between kingcraft and communism there is no logical or permanent abiding-place. The rights of all individuals must be recognized as equal, or, sooner or later, we must submit to the “divine rights of kings”—supreme thieves. Already, in these states, we have an upper ten and an upper ten thousand—virtually ten kings and ten thousand peers of the realm—whose wealth is stolen from the people by the vilest monopolies, usurpations; usuries; and this devilish aristocracy is not despised, but admired. To-day this aristocracy is more powerful and more vicious than that of Britain, and the vox populi is now really less effective in the United States than it is in the United Kingdom. Commercialism is organized discord. Communism is organized harmony. Commercialism is compulsory conflict. Communism is voluntary concert. Wm. Harrison Riley</p>

<dd>Thanks. That can be used as a source that Tucker differentiated voluntary and compulsory communism. But besides that what else does it say? He doesn't speak in the name of all individualist anarchists, as it can be seen in the note <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html#_note-95" title="Anarchism">108</a>. Also how it can be used as a source for most anarchist traditions? According to Larry Gamobne in <i>Proudhon and Anarchism</i>, Proudhon classified communism as a "Regime of Authority", and my impression is that Proudhon opposed both voluntary and compulsory kinds of communism. As for Bakunin, I'm not completely clear on his stance, but I haven't managed to find some text where he supports voluntary communism. <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVision_Thing_6e8a.html" title="User:Vision Thing">-- Vision Thing --</a> 19:21, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The question is not one of "support," or even of belief in the practicability of voluntary communism, but merely a question of whether or not two forms of communism, different in their intents, is recognized. Making a distinction between, say, Kropotkin and Marx is a basic tenet of pretty much all "social anarchism" currently. Bakunin's criticisms of anarchist communists are not the same as his criticisms of Marx. Etc. We need the clarification in order to differentiate between state and non-state forms. Bismark, Bellamy and Gronlund are as much on the individualists' minds as Most. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 20:06, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The second part <i>was</i> completely correct. You'll be hard pressed to find any anarchist of whatever stripe, not opposing authoritarian communism. You may believe that voluntary communism is impossible, and, thus, that, say, Kropotkin supported "authoritarian communism," but that's an imposition of POV. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 22:32, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that the second part was correct, but it was misleading because it implied that most anarchist schools don't oppose voluntary communism. Anyway, I think that it is obvious that all schools of anarchism oppose authoritarian forms of communism. It's just that they don't always agree on definition of "authoritarian". <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVision_Thing_6e8a.html" title="User:Vision Thing">-- Vision Thing --</a> 23:48, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ol>
<li>Dictionaries are descriptive, not prescriptive. They describe how words are commonly used, not how they should be used, or which words should be used. Ex: the <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_English_Dictionary_872c.html" title="Oxford English Dictionary">OED</a> insists upon the etymologically correct "-ize" suffix, but the majority of British English writers use the "-ise" suffix, not incorrectly (or, in the States, Webster's insists on "e-mail" where "email" is common and correct enough).</li>
<li>Dictionaries are incapable, by definition, of explaining even slightly complex systems of thought.</li>
<li>Dictionaries, by necessity and nature, are conservative (in the general sense).</li>
<li>For these reasons, dictionaries are not good academic resources. They are, at best, grammatical resources. The definitions that they provide are ironically far from definitive; in terms of giving the meaning of a concept, they should be used lightly. Ex: a dictionary is better at defining "to walk" than it is at defining "to be." Just ask <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Heidegger_eabc.html" title="Martin Heidegger">Martin Heidegger</a>.</li>
<li>No serious scholar uses a dictionary for research, unless one is a <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linguist.html" title="Linguist">linguist</a>. And we know that the best, most cunning linguists rarely refer to Webster.</li>
</ol>
<p>Enjoy this note. Really, these points are evident to anybody with a secondary school diploma, which is why I was surprised to see an actual discussion occurring here on the use of dictionaries as scholarly sources. Next time someone says, "Anarchy is X or Y because Dictionary Z defines it as such," kindly point them here. I'll now return to lurking. --AaronS 19:17, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding your point 1, it doesn't matter how words "should be used," whatever that means. What matters on Wikipedia is how words are used, whether you believe them to be used wrongly or not (besides, how words are commonly used is by default the "correct" usage because meaning of words is determined by consensus). And, yes, serious scholars do use dictionaries for research. There is nothing unscholarly at all with referencing a definition from a well-respected dictionary.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 19:34, 13 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I can assure you that dictionaries are almost never used for academic <i>research</i>, unless that research is linguistic in nature. Certainly, they are hardly ever used in any sort of discussion of systems of thought. Real research in philosophy and theory requires tomes. As for how words "should be used," the concept really isn't a difficult one. There are many reasons (historical, academic, political, etc.) for believing that a word should be used in one way and not another. The examples that I provided, which showed that dictionaries are not prescriptive, are clear enough. Also, you'll note that my contention is not with the referencing of dictionaries. Dictionaries exist for reference. I simply take issue with the argument that a dictionary is a sufficient or definitive reference in the explication of any even remotely complicated theoretical framework.</dd>
<dd>While an interesting theory, I think that many philosophers of language would disagree with you that the meaning of words is determined by consensus. That subject is quite unresolved, even at the beginning of the twenty-first century. --AaronS 20:51, 13 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I can assure you that dictionaries are often referenced in academic research that is not related to linguistics. Almost no one (you're an obvious exception) would disagree with me that the meaning of words are determined by consensus usage. Meanings of words change over time, and what causes them to change is the changing ways in which they are used. Dictionaries employ researchers to determine how the world is using a term and adjust definitions accordingly. Definitions of words are not static. They evolve.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 21:01, 13 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>A-C, a simple contradiction is a poor argument. Dictionaries are very rarely referenced in academic research that is not related to linguistics. I know this from experience, because I am very much involved in actual academic research (far from what passes for research here on Wikipedia). Outside of linguistics, they are usually referenced only insofar as a word's etymology is pertinent to a discussion, or if it provides an interesting insight.</dd>
<dd>Arguments and conclusions regarding any idea beyond the class including simple concepts like "to walk" or "to ingest" are almost never made on the basis of a dictionary definition. Unless it were a very special case, any such attempt would not be taken seriously. Again, I ask you to find a dictionary definition that adequately explains the meaning of "to be." If you do, you might want to present your amazing ontological findings to a philosophical journal. You'll be famous.</dd>
<dd>Moreover, your appeal to majority opinion is fallacious. I am not the one making claims about what the meanings of words are; you are. Your claim that they are based on majority opinion (a claim, which, ironically, you simply back up with majority opinion, apparently unaware of the logical fallacy involved) ignores both linguistics, semiology, and the philosophy of language. For that reason, it can be easily refuted with a very simple example: the majority thinks that Word X means F, but the minority thinks that Word X means G; both are correct.</dd>
<dd>What is important to remember, however, is that we are not talking about words. That is why it is almost always preposterous to bring a dictionary to the discussion, thump on it, and then proclaim victory. If you cannot understand this, then I feel sorry for the people here who have to work with you: this is a discussion about concepts, systems of thought, theories, philosophies, ideologies, and so on. It requires books, volumes and volumes of books. Dictionaries might provide interesting insights here and there, but, ninety-nine times out of one hundred, they are an inappropriate tool for this discussion. --AaronS 23:51, 13 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You're wrong. I've been involved in academic research and I know that reputable dictionaries are often referenced. Also, you don't know how meanings of words come about. They come about by usage. Meanings of words are not static. Meanings of words change as people change the way the use any particular word. Lexical researchers, those who work for dictionaries, conduct research to determine how educated people are using a word. That's why dictionaries are a great tool to see how a word is commonly being used. And, how a word is commonly being used, is by default the correct definition(s). There is no way that a word "should" be used other than the one or more ways in which it is commonly used. And, these ways change over time.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 00:29, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Goodness, in all my years of education, and in all of my reading, I've actually never seen a dictionary referenced. At least I do not have the audacity, however, to claim that they are <i>never</i> referenced. You, on the other hand, actually claim that they <i>often are</i>? Inconceivable. I suggest that you re-read what I wrote. You'll see that I was actually arguing against any static, fixed, or "definitive" definition. So, I'm not quite sure whose argument you are refuting. If you're just going to ignore my arguments and attack straw men (e.g. that I am saying that words should be used in a certain way, that I believe that meanings are static, etc. -- all ridiculous positions that I never espoused) then go ahead and entertain yourself. My point is that <i>there is no "correct" definition of words that signify complex ideas</i>. Again, I'll repeat, please find me a dictionary that adequately explains the meaning of "to be." Like "to be," "anarchism," "capitalism," "socialism," etc. are far too complex to rely on mere dictionary definitions. If you want to write a scholarly article on the meaning of "to descend," go right ahead. You can use all of the dictionaries that you want; but, I doubt that many will care to read it. If you're going to write a scholarly article on "anarchism," a dictionary is not the proper tool. It may be used to make interesting etymological notes or provide a few fun insights with regard to certain words, but it is not sufficient. Far from it, friend. That's all that I have to say on the matter. I don't really see the point in attempting to explain something to somebody so obstinately ideological as you are. --AaronS 03:29, 14 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You must not read much research then, because dictionary definitions are often referenced. It's important to know how a term is commonly used.

<dd>Dictionaries are not sufficient for complex ideas though. Oh, and guess what, anarchism is one of them. Just for fun, I'll tell you about the funny experience I had with dictionaries today. I tutor <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language_learning_and_teaching.html" title="English language learning and teaching">ESL</a> students at my college. Anyway, I was checking someone's work and they had to write a sentence. She said "I'm hungry and classmates are replete." First off, she should have said "my classmates" or something. Anyways, I asked her where she got the word replete from since it's not a very common word. Guess where she got it? Her freakin English-Russian dictionary. It says that is the proper English word to use for whatever "full" is in Russian. And as I just suggested, "full" is of course the proper term to use in that sentence. Yeah, replete is technically correct, but who the hell uses it? Dictionaries have serious problems expressing complex ideas. I can't say I've done research as of yet so I can't say how common dictionaries are, but I seriously doubt that they are used often for anything but cursory information. And although I've taken two (and after next semester, three) philosophy classes I've yet to talk about the philosophy of language, so I can't say for sure how words are truly defined. Actually Aaron, do you have any good introductions to that topic because it sounds interesting? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><b><font color="black">Ungovernable Force</font></b></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_6a81.html" title="User talk:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="green"><sup>Got something to say?</sup></font></a> 05:22, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>[edit conflict] Right now, Wikipedia has no coherent policy regarding reliable sources; so you are correct to say that there is no policy or guideline that prohibits or restricts referencing to dictionaries. But if you are truly concerned with writing a high-quality, reputable encyclopedia, then you will follow the basic conventions of academic research, which strongly discourage (if not prohibit) the use of dictionaries as references in the social sciences and humanities. If you are truly concerned with the quality of this encyclopedia, you will focus on what you can and should do to make it better rather than on what you prohibited from doing. -- <a href="../../../w/g/e/User%7EWGee_01b0.html" title="User:WGee">WGee</a> 05:35, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's not true. The conventions of academic research definitely do not discourage the use of well-respected dictionaries as references for the meanings of terms. Dictionaires such as the OED and Merriam-Webster Interational are excellent scholary sources. The definitions are well-researched and peer reviewed.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 06:05, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The OED is a fine scholarly source if you're interested in changes of meanings of words over time. I don't think I've ever seen a dictionary used in a scholarly article to simply give the definition of a word, and with good reason - dictionary definitions aren't normative. Could you point us to an example? <a href="../../../v/o/l/User%7EVoluntarySlave_e88b.html" title="User:VoluntarySlave">VoluntarySlave</a> 07:04, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>But in none of the article on the first page, at least, is the dictionary definition used as the basis of an argument. Either it's just a rhetorical technique, a starting point for discussion (and a hoary cliché, too), or, more commonly, the dictionary definition is quoted in order to be criticized. "An absolute definition of urban is elusive" <a href="http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.32.081501.114040" class="external autonumber" title="http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.32.081501.114040" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> (and the article goes on to explain the authors' own definition); "Webster's Dictionary defines race as "any of the major biological divisions of mankind, distinguished by color and texture of hair, color of skin and eyes, stature, bodily proportions, etc." But are the crucial differences among human beings really those of superficial appearance?" <a href="http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/122/8/614" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/122/8/614" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> (leaving aside specialized dictionaries, which are a different matter; I'd be happy to use definitions from, say, a dictionary of political science in the article). <a href="../../../v/o/l/User%7EVoluntarySlave_e88b.html" title="User:VoluntarySlave">VoluntarySlave</a> 08:20, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yep. There was another one where the google teaser is <i>The Merriam–Webster dictionary defines a gradient as “a graded difference in physiologic activity along an axis”,but the definition does not reveal the[...]</i> The rest is cut off, and unfortunately the link is dead. Still, it sounds like they were about to rip Merriam-Webster a new one. Also, two of the ones on the front page <i>are</i> from specialized dictionaries. As VolunarySlave points out, this is a (highly cliched) rhetorical technique, and I've even been told not to use it in writing classes because it is cliched. It isn't being used as a source for research. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><b><font color="black">Ungovernable Force</font></b></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_6a81.html" title="User talk:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="green"><sup>Got something to say?</sup></font></a> 08:25, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Criticizing a dictionary definition is something we're not at liberty to do, unless the criticism is sourced. In other words, Wikipedia is not the place for original research.

<dd>Id recomend you go read some Quine and perhaps Wittgenstein on the use of definitions, especially Quine. First of if a definition in a dictionary is to be called necesarylly the right or true definition of a term it has to be analytic, also a term used frequently in philosophy. If you dont know it that means it has to be known before experience, and that impossible with a dictionary definition. Such a one is dependent on experience, and therefore cannot possible be necesarily true. My experience with the philosophy of language has led me to believe that Quines rejection of analyticity is not something to just outright believe, but that doesnt mean his arguments isnt sound. At least his thinking around dictionary definitions and analyticity which demands a non-cirkular definition of synonymi to be justified is relevant to this discussion. Id gladly write a resume of this, but i guess it would be better if you read his work: From a logical point of view, especially chapter II (Two dogmas of empiricism). It is a classic, and a text anybody who wants to discuss definition should read! Just think about it: If you want a contemporary view on the possibility of defining a term in such a way that the definition is the true one, and therefore necesarily the only one, you have to read the classics first! And anarcho-capitalism: You should read this one! Itll give you a good introduction into the problems of dictionary definitions, and therefore of the problems of using consensus definitions in scholarly work. --<a href="../../../f/j/u/User%7EFjulle_b5aa.html" title="User:Fjulle">Fjulle</a> 13:57, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also you might just read the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_definition" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_definition" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_definition</a> even tough its a stub it puts you in a problematic position if you want the dictionary definition to be the only one. Why because if those definitions are a product of usage, and we know that usage is unstable and ever changing, these definitions will be unstable and ever changing. Therefore it is not possible to labl it the most precise or the best possible definition. Any other definition will, actually, do just as well, and thats not what we want with wikipedia right? You must admit that the definitions made by those who have written and got their stuff published about anarchism is at least just as relevant! --<a href="../../../f/j/u/User%7EFjulle_b5aa.html" title="User:Fjulle">Fjulle</a> 14:06, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Charlatanism is no substitute for an argument, by the way. The articles that you cite, as I and others have already pointed out, cite dictionaries either as a stylistic cliché, or define relatively simple ideas ("gradient," "condensable," "usable"). Furthermore, as I and others have already noted, the dictionary definitions <i>never</i> form the basis of an argument or inform any conclusion. So far, your only counterargument has been "No, you are wrong." You can repeat that all you want, my friend, but unfortunately, it doesn't change very much. This discussion has already gone on long enough, and more or less demonstrates the ridiculousness of so much of Wikipedia. When so many people have to explain as simple a concept as this to a stubborn ideologue such as yourself, and so little progress is made, it doesn't really bode well for the project. I wanted to see if anybody would actually dispute my claim regarding dictionaries, and I'm not at all surprised by who did. --AaronS 14:34, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>By all means, there are places for citing tertiary sources in scholarly works. But to use tertiary sources preferentially to build up another tertiary sources is to assure a kind of <i>garbage in, garbage out</i> process. Dictionaries do not determine meaning. Like all non-primary materials, they attempt to document meanings, however approximately. It is abundantly clear that dictionary definitions are not adequate to organizing these encyclopedia entries, and the existing Wikipedia policies certainly <i>do not</i> elevate dictionary definitions above conflicting primary and secondary sources, any more than scholarly standards do. Concretely, when primary and secondary sources show that words like "capitalism" and "socialism" have been used in a variety of ways, it is not possible to use a tertiary source to determine the correct definition. This is in no way contrary to Wikipedia policies, as the diversity of definitions in current (and historical) use is uncontroversially apparent. Appeals to what "most people" belief, or a majority rules philosophy of meaning, are necessarily POV OR. In any event, none of the problems supposedly solved by the appeal to dictionary authority as particularly difficult to address in a serious, scholarly manner.

<dd>Right, dictionaries do not determine meaning. They conduct research and report it. Meaning of words are determined by how people are using those words. The rest of what you're saying I agree with. If I'm going to cite a dictionary, I'm going to cite it to show the popular consensus meanings of the term. I wouldn't cite a dictionary definition to claim that that is the only meaning.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 20:53, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>OK. But the way most people use a word is still not normative and, more importantly, it may not be particularly conscious. We need to make the issues here explicit without engaging in a lot of editorializing. For example, it is almost certainly the case that what most people have meant when they said "anarchist" or "socialist" was fairly thoroughly uninformed. That majoritarian meaning cannot be our guideline. This is particularly true in a case, such as this, where we are discussing the meaning of explicitly oppositional movements. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 21:32, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are ridiculous A-C. You aren't providing any evidence of your viewpoint, only stating that those who disagree are wrong. that doesn't fly. we certianly never used dictionary definitions in history school, though i can't recall anyone ever saying not to, it was just common sense for someone doing scholarly historical research/writing. i don't believe i've ever seen a dictionary cited in a scholarly work pertaining to history or politics. High school students certianly might start of with a "The dictionary defines blank as..." but no serious writer would be so trite. citing a dictionary definition in order to contradict it (as some of your examples did) obviously does not reinforce your point. Even fjulle, who generally seems pro-ancap, disagrees with you. did you ever cite a dictionary in a college course pertaining to political theory or some other humanities course? i wager not. <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlockader_5d3e.html" title="User:Blockader">Blockader</a> 18:39, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>There doesn't seem to be much disagreement about the dynamic and plural nature of language, although, having acknowledged these two characteristics, it's hard to support the majority-makes-true-meaning argument that seems to be advanced here. The main bone of contention seems to be whether or not dictionaries "define" definitively enough to "trump" obvious counter-definitions in the primary and secondary sources. Are dictionary definitions normative? Dictionaries are <i>tertiary sources</i>, meaning they are one step further removed from actual primary source usages than secondary sources, which already involve some degree of interpretation and simplification. Dictionaries necessarily have a majoritarian bias, and are useful to the extent that they are used with that bias in mind. I'm actually fond of <i>using</i> dictionary definitions as starting point, anchors or foils in scholarly arguments, but such definitions inevitable <i>ask questions</i>, rather than <i>answering</i> them. (Come to think of it, my last two published works were at least partially about the problems of inapt definitions getting in the way of serious scholarship.) Wikipedia has no specific policy about tertiary sources, but its other policies suggest that unambiguous primary source material still has greater weight than secondary material. Surely, the same would be true of the relationship between primary and secondary sources vs. sources like dictionaries. It is, in fact, <i>unambiguously clear</i> that there is now, and consistently has been, considerably more diversity in the usage of key terms than the dictionaries (including very good ones) suggest. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 19:15, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes dictionaries have a majoritarian bias, and that's what good about them. The researchers find out how most educated people are using a term and report the definition. As far as proper meanings of words, it's comparable to pronounciation. If enough people start pronouncing a word "wrong," it eventually becomes a correct pronounciation. What words refer to is no different. What socialism or capitalism means today, it might not have meant yesterday. Dictionaries are great sources to show what the popular meaning(s) of a term are. And again, the OED and the Merriam-Webster Third New Internation are the best researched and peer-reviewed. Then, of course there are specialized dictionaries of philosophy and dictionaries of economics, etc, which can also be great sources. It's consistent with the Wikipedia mission against original research that we do as little of our own interpretation as possible, so secondary and tertiary sources are great when what is being said in a primary source may not be so clear. We definitely should not be synthesizing our own definitions here. As far as your claim that "its other policies suggest that unambiguous primary source material still has greater weight than secondary material," that's not true. In fact, the policy <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> says "Although most articles should rely predominantly on secondary sources, there are rare occasions when they may rely entirely on primary sources (for example, current events or Braunfeld v. Brown). An article or section of an article that relies on a primary source should (1) only make descriptive claims, the accuracy of which is easily verifiable by any reasonable adult without specialist knowledge, and (2) make no analytic, synthetic, interpretive, explanatory, or evaluative claims. Contributors drawing on entirely primary sources should be careful to comply with both conditions."<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 20:44, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think your statement that, "Individualist anarchists oppose democracy.

<dd>There's not any individualist anarchists that support democracy. That's fundamental to individualism. The community has no authority over the individual. If the vote or "consensus" is 1,000,000 to one that an individual will be deprived of a part of the product of his labor to give it to someone who is believed to need it more and that person is the only one who disagrees, then it is illegitimate to deprive him of it.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 18:06, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

First off, I understand the difference between "anarchy" and "anarchism", you know. We went over this. Anarchy is important for the analysis of instrumental arguments concerning anarchism. It's an obvious fact that encyclopedia articles on the idea of Democracy cover the ancient Greeks and the modern Americans (even though neither is a pure democracy, they're both useful for analyzing instrumental arguments).--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 23:02, 30 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The problem is that you simply don't <i>have</i> a logical argument, unless you accept the very insufficient definition of <i>anarchism</i> imposed on us by Wikipedia's structure and a few aggressive partisans. <i>Actual</i> and <i>specific</i> ideologies of anarchism have almost never been limited to the absence of a state as a sufficient condition of "anarchy" in the political sense. Even most of our anarcho-capitalist associates would not accept that definition, except in circumstances such as those we face on Wikipedia. Assume that Somalia was indeed "stateless," and treat it as an "instrumentality of anarchism." What do you get? At best, you get something related to "Anarchism as defined in dictionaries and other sources too abstract to be much practical use." That is, you get an "instrumentality" of something inconsequential—and if you try to make this an example of the consequences of "anarchism," you simply have to falsify nearly every <i>actual anarchism</i> and in the process skip over every <i>actual</i> "instrumentality" (every experiment, every cooperative colony and equity village, etc.) This is bad history. In accepting a definition of "anarchism" that almost nobody actually holds, it is you who abstracts the article from real ideologies and real histories. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 23:16, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, you don't find anarchists talking about this, you know why? For the same reason that advocates of complete state control refuse to celebrate genocidal dictatorships. The fact that noone talks about supporting an anarchy doesn't make it dissapear in a poof of logic, as you would suggest. Secondly, the article being too large is a ridiculous argument. This is a huge article because it involves theorists debating the theoretical questions ad infinitum without any reference to the material facts (aside from the coverage of the social movements). I'm trying to add the material facts, and I'm reverted because anarchists don't support (with good reason) the anarchy of Somalia-- which <b>was</b> anarchy, according to the Oxford Companion of Philosophy, as well as several other sources.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 23:25, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>When you raise "material facts" about things no anarchist supports, and blatantly ignore the material facts of anarchist history, and when you are obviously on some sort of ideological campaign to make <i>somebody</i> "face facts," you aren't going to get very far. It appears that your knowledge of anarchism does not stretch beyond the <i>Oxford Philosophy Companion</i>. With that much, of course, you can quite possibly impose your POV on the article, but you will only be <i>obscuring</i> the actual facts about the plight of stateless people in a state-dominated world. You will, imho, be giving real aid and comfort to those who would like to blame anarchists for the failures of the state. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 23:31, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Having given up on logic and reason, you resort to the political argument that I'm pushing an anti-anarchist POV. That's ridiculous. You're reverting me because of the plight of stateless people, which somehow allows you to bypass Wikipedia policy and not operate based on secondary sources and NPOV.

<dd><i>Ahem</i>. I've given you plenty of logical and reasonable arguments against the inclusion of your off-topic sections. As a bonus, I've noted that you're confusing the issue in rather unfortunate ways. I haven't heard anything coherent in response, aside from an appeal to the dubious authority of the <i>Oxford Philosophy Companion.</i> Which particular anarchist ideologues advocated <i>mere statelessness</i> as the goal of anarchism? Are you, btw, at all familiar with the <i>actual</i> discussions of anarchists regarding Somalia? I'm reverting you because you added a complete <i>non sequitor</i> to an article already fraught with problems. I'm annoyed with you because you certainly <i>seem</i> to be engaged in a little political misdirection here. Or perhaps you really know absolutely nothing about anarch<i>ism</i>, in which case the article, troubled as it is, ought to be some help. Or perhaps, some way and somehow, you really can't tell the difference between "mutual aid and voluntary association" and a civil war taking place in a state-governmental interregnum.

<p>Uh. Right. One might also want to dispute your statement on Somalia being "stateless": while there is (was) clearly no de facto central authority, other points might hinder it from qualifying as "stateless". Our own <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somalia.html" title="Somalia">Wikipedia article</a> states that <i><a href="../../../d/e/_/De_facto.html" title="De facto">de facto</a> authority resides in the hands of the governments for the unrecognized entities of <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somaliland.html" title="Somaliland">Somaliland</a>, <a href="../../../p/u/n/Puntland.html" title="Puntland">Puntland</a>, the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Islamic_Courts_Council_71e1.html" title="Supreme Islamic Courts Council">Supreme Islamic Courts Council</a> (SICC) and the weak, but <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>-recognized, interim <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transitional_Federal_Government_3b57.html" title="Transitional Federal Government">Transitional Federal Government</a> (TFG) in <a href="../../../b/a/i/Baidoa.html" title="Baidoa">Baidoa</a></i>, and the CIA World Factbook labels the nation Somalia as <i>no permanent national government; transitional, parliamentary federal government</i> and <i>following the breakdown of the central government, most regions have reverted to local forms of conflict resolution, either secular, traditional Somali customary law, or Shari'a (Islamic) law with a provision for appeal of all sentences</i>. While this obviously shows Somalia is <i>without a central authority</i>, it is not <i>stateless</i>: <i>A state is a set of institutions that possesses the exclusive legitimate authority to make the rules that govern the people in one or more societies, having internal and external sovereignty over a definite territory</i> (from <a href="../../../s/t/a/State.html" title="State">State</a>).

<p>Actually, I am the author of published work on anarchism, but not, alas, on its relation to Somalia. We can grant to you that Somalia was, prior to the ICU an "anarchy" in a couple of senses that Wikipedia rules acknowledge. You have not, however, provided any source that shows the relevance of this "anarchy" to any of the actual anarchist traditions. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 19:22, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Failed anarchies inform the anarchist tradition what to avoid, do they not? They are the basis for the need of consensus reasoning and other systems suggested by anarchist views, right? So clearly the instrumental implications of failed anarchies do effect anarchist ideology. In fact, anarchists spend a lot of their time explaining why an anarchist society would not fall apart. They could detail which processes would have prevented Somalia from falling into chaos after the government fell.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 01:50, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No one here shows any signs of granting you that the "anarchies" in places like Somalia had anything to do with the articles you are tampering with. It's like you looked at "football" (soccer) and "American football," and took the word of some expert when he said "football is a funny game; nobody can agree on the rules and some of the balls have pointy ends and some don't. All we can really say is that 'football is played on grass (or artificial grass)'." Somalia is an example of a <i>failed government</i>. You cannot have a "failed anarchy" where no "anarchy" (in the sense of a collectivity based in anarchist principles) was attempted. You <i>might</i> be able to find a primitivist or two who think the "project of anarchism" ought to be simply the removal of the state. In that case, we would still cite <i>undue weight</i> against the sort of treatment you are attempting. I have already said that any careful attention to <i>actual</i> "failed anarchies" would be welcome. But you're apparently not interested in that. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 19:22, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In insisting on a very open definition of anarchism, our an-cap cousins have given you an opening to include this "connection," but that still doesn't mean that there is any <i>actual</i> resemblence between <i>anarchism</i> and pre-ICU Somalia.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree-- no serious form of anarchism, except some sort of anarchistic nihilism (e.g The War Nerd <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Brecher_4fcc.html" title="Gary Brecher">Gary Brecher</a> holds such a view on African anarchy) would value the anarchy in Somalia. However, all serious forms of anarchy must also defend against the criticism that their ideas, in conjunction with human nature, will lead to the same "unintended" anarchies that have happened throughout history. Remember: history will never perfectly match the men of words, it will never match perfectly the ideas behind the mass movement-- that's life, that's reality. The history also raises questions of human nature for anarchism to address- why do humans descend into chaotic anarchy if human nature tends toward justice and truth? I surely can't answer these questions, but maybe the anarchists in the articles could. I truly look forward to it.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 01:50, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, bother. "Human nature," eh? "Tending towards justice and truth"? If you don't actually know anything about anarchist theory, could you please, please, please just go away and not introduce all of these misunderstandings into a process that is already close to impossible? I'm serious.

<p>Greek democracy was in at least some senses a movement, or at least a consciously evolved experiment. The analogues within anarchist history would be Warren's equity villages, the Home community, some parts of Spain during the Civil War there (and so on.)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Greek democracy was not a pure democracy. No democratic theorist would propose a purely Greek model today, because it eventually lost control. <b>And yet</b>, we still consider the Greek democracy, despite its failures, as indicative of some of the instrumental challenges that democracy faces. Any serious article on any serious political philosophy should consider history in such a way-- it shouldn't require small, perfect movements-- it should also look at the big events in history in the context of the idea.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 01:50, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Greek democracy was, however, part of the tradition and development of democracy. Subsequent approaches to the question of <i>democracy</i> reference the Greek model. Somalia is only related to anarchism because it can be described by the <i>other</i> (non-anarchistic) sense of the word "anarchy." As for "small, perfect movement," you are protesting against something no one is advocating. This entry is currently stretched so wide that it is unmanageable. In part, it is this fact which has prevented more treatment of both practical experiments and their failures. The article is gradually improving in that regard, although I suspect you may set us back in that regard with your <i>non sequitors</i>. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 19:22, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The roaming gangs were bodies with the (self-granted) authority to make and the power to enforce laws within a group. Therefore, they were governments.

Their government was compulsory because one could not opt to forgo their governance without (probably severe) consequences.
