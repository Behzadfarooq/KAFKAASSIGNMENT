<h2><span class="mw-headline">anarcho-capitalism</span></h2>
<p>Anarcho-capitalism is viewed by nearly all anarchists as an outside movement that uses the term "anarchy" to denote a concept that is entirely different from "anarchy" as it has been used by all previous anarchists in the history of the movement. Anarcho-capitalism bears the same relationship to anarchism that Creation Science bears to science: it is an attempt to gain legitimacy by misusing a well-defined term. --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 17:06, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Why is it disputed? If <a href="../../../i/n/d/Individualist_anarchism.html" title="Individualist anarchism">individualist anarchism</a> can be part of the template, then certainly <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalism</a> can too. Intangible 21:14, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The dispute is to whether anarcho-capitalism is anarchism at all, wheras there is little debate about individualist anarchism. Most anarachists (including myself) view capitalism as inherently authoritarian and hierarchical, thus necessitating it's rejection by anarchists (including individualist anarchists). An-caps are just (American) libertarians on steroids. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force">The Ungovernable Force</a> 21:19, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>You could say that. It is disputed because this is a template about Anarchism, as is shown from the (A), it is frequently and loudly disputed as to whether Anarcho-capitalism is "Anarchism" (as in the (A) kind). Therefore we present that. It is rarely and quietly disputed if any of the other schools are "Anarchism", so they aren't labelled as disputed. - <a href="../../../f/-/m/User%7EF-m-t_02fb.html" title="User:F-m-t">FrancisTyers</a> <a href="../../../f/-/m/User_talk%7EF-m-t_cc17.html" title="User talk:F-m-t">·</a> 22:22, 15 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Small cap anarchism in the meaning of term. Namely that it should be about anarchism as generic term. Which individual anarchists? Spooner? Tucker? Intangible 17:25, 16 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It doesn't matter what somebody thinks Spooner or Tucker or any of the individualists believed. Individualist anarchism (a) was disputed at the time and (b) is long dead. All modern anarchists come out of the socialist tradition. That is the only tradition that has an unbroken line of continuity, which means socialist anarhism is the only living part of the anarchist movement, and the only thing that can be called anarchism properly is <i>that movement</i> or anything that might evolve out of <i>that movement</i> in the future. If some misguided folks want to revive selected distortions of historically anarchist concepts, no problem. But don't call it anarchism, because it is not a continuous line between the old ideas and the new. You could call it pseudo-anarchism or quasi-anarchism, or whatever. Ancap is simply a different movement from anarchism proper. --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 19:56, 21 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>To be fair, many modern anarchists are anti-capitalist but would be wary of describing themselves as socialist. Certainly that is true of the primitivists, post-leftists, post-structuralists, and probably most of the greens as well. The whole "take back the factories" mantra of the past doesn't hold up so well when you have people questioning the need for factories, or the need to work in one. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 20:01, 21 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Nonetheless, they evolved out of a socialist tradition. Even if all the anarchists in the world got together and said "to hell with anti-authoritarianism, we're all converting to Scientology" they would still be the legitimate standardbearers of anarchism. It's a shared history and culture that defines any movement. Anarchism happens to trace back to a socialist tradition, but if a bunch of anarchists converted to ancap, taking their anarchist culture with them, <i>then</i> you could make a case for <i>that</i> branch of ancap being a type of anarchism. That could still happen. But it hasn't yet, so all existing ancaps will have to be happy as right-libertarians, because that's their culture and history. --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 04:51, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What makes you think it's about "anarchism" as opposed to "Anarchism"? First off, the template's title says "Anarchism". And is there really much of a difference, other than the semantical one you want to make to justify including a highly disputed (per)version of anarchism in the template without any disclaimer? And just because you can show a diff of the template that included an-cap w/o a disclaimer doesn't show much at all, because I can (but won't b/c I don't feel like spending the time) show you diffs of all the times people have removed it from the template all together. <font color="black"><b>The</b></font> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="green"><b>Ungovernable</b></font></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_6a81.html" title="User talk:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="black"><b>Force</b></font></a> 02:26, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not saying that was the right way for it to be. Regardless, there were times where an-cap was not included for a while (like feb-april).

<dl>
<dd>Well, I thought of it as a debate, not an argument, but hey. And like I said, I'm not defending it's removal or the people who did it. I'm just explaining why it's labelled as disputed. And you never answered my question about why you seem to think this is about "anarchism" and not "anarchism", nor did you fully explain the difference. <font color="black"><b>The</b></font> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="green"><b>Ungovernable</b></font></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_6a81.html" title="User talk:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="black"><b>Force</b></font></a> 02:56, 17 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The difference is that Anarchism will always be some instance of anarchism. The latter simply means "without rulers" (from the Greek <i>αναρχία</i>), nothing more, nothing less. The instance Anarchism can mean different things: like anarcho capitalism, anarcho syndicalism or individualist anarchism. Therefore the template should be about anarchism, not Anarchism, because one cannot in a NPOV way decide which Anarchism presents a valid argument, and should counter any other form of Anarchism.

<dd>Seconded. The word "anarchy" means "without rulers," not "without heirarchy." There's no reason for anarcho-capitalism to be any more "disputed" than the other forms listed in this template. The popular opinions or relative positions of other self-designated anarchists regarding anarcho-capitalism are entirely irrelevant.

<dd>That's not a question, it's a statement of fact. They have authority over others by their having those things when others do not. I'm not asking if that's right or wrong ethically (personally, I think it's wrong), I'm pointing out that an anarchist can't support those things while still calling themselves an anarchist based on H3h's definition. Anyways, like Sarge and I said, that's not really the important part here. What is important is that as a social movement anarchism has pretty much always rejected capitalism. Why don't you focus on the larger points of our arguments, rather than the small details that I even admit aren't as important? <font color="black"><b>The</b></font> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="green"><b>Ungovernable</b></font></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_6a81.html" title="User talk:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="black"><b>Force</b></font></a> 22:08, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Yes and no. Most anarchists make a distinction between two different types of property: personal posessions and private capital. Different terms are used, but most anarchists would agree that personal posessions are fine up to a point but private capital is almost always used to maintain power relationships. In other words, it's fine to have your toothbrush, your house, your car, but if you acquire large amounts of wealth from, for example, making profit off others' labor, then you're effectively a ruler of those people. That's exploitation. You <i>cannot</i> rationally call yourself an anarchist if you support exploitative relationships because that is the very definition of rulership. Thus, anarcho-capitalists are not anarchists because they either don't recognize the difference between the two types of property, or they recognize it but don't have a problem with exploitation. Differences in power = rulership. --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 12:11, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Historical anarchists have always considered the power relationships that issue from capitalism to be a type of rule. The slogan "No Gods, No Masters!" is a reflection of this. Anarcho-capitalism did not originate from within the anarchist movement, and does not share the same understanding of rulership that constitutes perhaps the only uniting link between all anarchists. To call anarcho-capitalism a type of anarchism is to distort the notion of anarchism to the point of uselessness. --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 17:12, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not at all...differences are fine, as long as they emerged <i>from within</i> the anarchist movement, i.e. as a result of divisions among existing anarchists (as individualist anarchism did). Let me ask you an hypothetical question. Let's say some guy decides he wants to be king of the world, and when he achieves this end, he will declare a state of chaos, and at that time, he personally will force everybody to be chaotic. Okay, bear with me. Now, let us assume that he decides to call his new system "anarcho-monarchism" because he thinks anarchism has something to do with chaos. Should, in your opinion, "anarcho-monarchism" now be included in the template? One more question: what if a microbrewery releases a new beer produced by a process they call "anarcho-brewing". Should this be considered a type of anarchism? In short, do you think that *every* wacko that misuses the label "anarchism" should be included on this page? --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 12:14, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>(1) demonstrate that it emerged from within the anarchist movement</dd>
<dd>(2) demonstrate that it shares some particular philosophy with other anarchists</dd>
<dd>(3) provide a convincing argument for why points (1) &amp; (2) are not valid criteria</dd>

<dd>Let me quote Sanders instead: Some of those who argue against the state call themselves "capitalist anarchists." Others contend that this is a contradiction in terms, since capitalism institutionally requires the state. Curiously enough, the capitalist anarchists frequently say the same thing about the socialists...At least as regards the arguments that arise among anarchists, and to a considerable extent also as regards the more general argument, this conflict rests largely on terminological ambiguity...This terminological ambiguity can be resolved fairly easily. One way to do it is for capitalist anarchists simply to begin to refer to themselves as "market anarchists." This would at least avoid the nearly pointless arguments, endemic between the two groups, about whether capitalism really is driven by markets. If it isn't, then market anarchists are no happier with capitalism than socialist anarchists are. (from For and Against the State). Intangible 16:32, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Listen, anarchism is a type of socialism--it absolutely requires evening out wealth--there's no way around it. So, are you unable to address the points I made, or just unwilling? I'm not sure why I should treat your opinion with any more respect than you treat mine, but I will address the Sanders quote nonetheless: Sanders says that if capitalism is not driven by markets, then "market anarchists" are anticapitalists too--okay, so Sanders agrees that pro-capitalists aren't anarchists. However, Sanders does not say that "market anarchists" are anti-rulership or anti-heirarchy. Thus, by the definition of the word anarchism, they are not anarchists. If you support any kind of rulership, you are not an anarchist. End of story. Are you willing to claim that anarcho-capitalists oppose all rulership? Are you ever actually going to address any of the points I make here or above? --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 17:35, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Anarchism is not socialism (or collectivism) per se. Benjamin Tucker for example though that wealth should be distributed according to the mechanism of the free market.</dd>

<dd>You are free to believe that economic coersion into contractual servitude is "voluntary" but anarchists disagree, and always have, thus ancaps reject a core principle of anarchism.</dd>
<dd>(1) You admit then that ancap has, at best, a tenuous continuity with a dead form of anarchism.</dd>
<dd>(2) By that argument, capitalism is a form of communism because the <i>only</i> difference is the total core of the economic theory. Even most individualists agreed that profit, rent, and interest are forms of exploitation (e.g. rulership), something that ancaps do not agree with.</dd>
<dd>(3) &amp; (4) The Sanders quote you supplied doesn't make the point you seem to think it does--in fact, it comes close to making the opposite point. Furthermore, Sanders apparently subscribes to the idea that anarchism = anti-statism. Anarchists have always argued against this mistake. Furthermore, if I'm not mistaken, most ancaps are pro-corporate, whereas all anarchists see corporations as a type rulership, if not outright states. Thus, anarchists aren't really anti-state either.</dd>
<dd>Rejecting anarchist notions of profit, rent, interest, heirarchy, rulership, exploitation, I have to wonder what you think ancaps actually have in common with anarchists.

<dd>A logical extension after an etymology of the word "anarchism" would be to talk about movements who see anarchism as a political end, which would be a discussion of the generic term anarchism, i.e. a discussion about the classes of movements who see anarchism as a political end. Intangible 15:54, 18 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But we have already established that etymology has nothing to do with meaning. 'Anarchism' is a term that describes a political philosophy and movement. Discussion of anarchism, in the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a> article, as well as in the anarchism series, should be limited to that. If you want to start an article on anarchism (word), go ahead. --AaronS 16:17, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Etymology is the study of the origins of words. You seem to be proposing that the meaning of <i>anarchism</i> lies in etymology. But, we already know that <i>anarchism</i>, the political and philosophical movement, has a meaning that lies in its political and philosophical theory. Edit the article on <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchy.html" title="Anarchy">anarchy</a> or create a new article, anarchism (word), if you want to talk of etymology. --AaronS 16:44, 18 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>From <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a>: <i>"Anarchism is the name for both a political philosophy and manner of organizing society, derived from the Greek αναρχία ("without archons" or "without rulers"). Thus "anarchism," in its most general semantic meaning, is the belief that all forms of rulership are undesirable and should be abolished."</i> This corresponds 100% with what I am saying here on the talk page. It logically connects etymology with the generic term for movements that see anarchism as the political end. Intangible 16:52, 18 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The meaning of the word, in the context of its political and philosophical implications, is not in its etymology. --AaronS 17:11, 18 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Of course not. If that were to be the case one could just do with an etymology of the word anarchism in the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a> article and call it a day. Intangible 17:22, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Maybe you are not familiar with this quote by Tucker:
<dl>
<dd>"Anarchism is a word without meaning, unless it includes the liberty of the individual to control his product or whatever his product has brought him through exchange in a free market - that is, private property. Whoever denies private property is of necessity an Archist."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>So, according to Tucker, anyone who opposes private property is an archist. Obviously there are various visions of that what anarchism is, and some of them exclude each other.

There are plenty of people who are oppossed to both communism and capitalism. This template is about anarchism as a historical trend, similar to it's presentation in other encyclopedias. Since anarcho-capitalism's place in that trend is disputed by many anarchists and scholars, we should label it as disputed. Other schools/traditions (like anarcho-communism, indiv anarchism, post-left anarchism, etc) are rarely disputed, at least not as much and as passionately as anarcho-capitalism is.

<dd>It's important to note that economics isn't the only position anarcho-capitalists have a radically different stand on things. They support private police forces, private laws, private everything. Really you can sum anarcho-capitalism up as radical privatization, or an extreme form of social contract theory. To anarcho-capitalists, even slavery is acceptable, in principle. Not surprisingly, few people have even bothered trying to reconcile such a position with anarchism. Even anarcho-capitalists tend not to see themselves as representing a form of anarchism but as representing <i>the</i> form of anarchism, or the "purest" form. There's just too big a gap between anarcho-capitalist philosophy and traditional anarchism to include the former without some form of disclaimer. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 21:06, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Who cares. Great, you think it's a small step from indiv anarchism to an-cap. But do you still want to say it's not disputed? This is exactly the nature of the dispute: some people say it's a type of indiv anarchism, others say it's not even that. In other words, people <i>dispute</i> whether it's a type of anarchism. This talk page is proof of that. You're never going to convince us that an-cap is a form of anarchism, and we'll probably never convince you that it isn't. We can debate it for years on end and never come to a conclusion. Let's stop trying to convince each other that it is/n't a form of anarchism and agree to disagree.

<dd>This is second time this week that I'm encountering this claim about slavery. It looks like a lot of antianarcho-capitalist doesn't know for what anarcho-capitalism really stands for. In his "The Ethics of Liberty" Rothbard said:</dd>
<dd>"The fundamental axiom of libertarian theory is that each person must be a self-owner, and that no one has the right to interfere with such self-ownership. From this there follows immediately the total impermissibility of property in another person. One prominent example of this sort of property is the institution of slavery. Before 1865, for example, slavery was a "private property" title to many persons in the United States. The fact of such private title did not make it legitimate; on the contrary, it constituted a continuing aggression, a continuing criminality, of the masters (and of those who helped enforce their titles) against their slaves." <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVision_Thing_6e8a.html" title="User:Vision Thing">-- Vision Thing --</a> 20:25, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let me quote Sanders instead: Some of those who argue against the state call themselves "capitalist anarchists." Others contend that this is a contradiction in terms, since capitalism institutionally requires the state. Curiously enough, the capitalist anarchists frequently say the same thing about the socialists...At least as regards the arguments that arise among anarchists, and to a considerable extent also as regards the more general argument, this conflict rests largely on terminological ambiguity...This terminological ambiguity can be resolved fairly easily. One way to do it is for capitalist anarchists simply to begin to refer to themselves as "market anarchists." This would at least avoid the nearly pointless arguments, endemic between the two groups, about whether capitalism really is driven by markets. If it isn't, then market anarchists are no happier with capitalism than socialist anarchists are. (from For and Against the State). Intangible 16:32, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Right. As I've said before, there's no point trying to convince Wikipedia editors that anarchism and capitalism are compatible or not compatible. Our points of view on the topic are largely irrelevant. Changing editors' points of view doesn't change what is a neutral point of view.

<dd>There are three reasons not to drop it. 1) There are more anarchists than ancaps and our internet presence is growing faster than theirs, so we're likely to win out eventually, as long as we don't allow a precedent to be set now. 2) As long as we keep the argument going, ancaps and onlookers are being educated whether they like it or not. 3) Ancaps only want to be noted here and elsewhere because it gives them an opportunity to convert people, and that is something anarchists should oppose. While I think it is reasonable to have a remark within the body of the article to the effect that ancaps believe themselves to be anarchists, if you put it in the template you are incorrectly implying that other anarchists recognize them as such.

Also, I'm claiming right here that anarcho-capitalism is not a type of anarchism. Many other anarchists have said the same thing, including many editors here, and many notable anarchists in the real world. Also, many classic anarchists (who were around before an-cap developed) have claimed that anarchism is inherently anti-capitalist. Therefore, it's disputed.

<dd>Ah, here we have the heart of the problem. You want to say that anarchism = opposition to state. But that means you've changed the definition of anarchism. As we all know anarchism, as defined by anarchists, has always meant opposition to rulership <u>including economic domination</u>. This is why anarchism is <b>iherently</b> socialist. You can't throw out the economic part of the definition and still call it anarchism. But is economic domination rulership? You could disagree with that analysis, but that is the way <i>anarchists</i> see it. So, if you disagree, then you are not an anarchist. Anarchists think that every time one person is in a position of power over another, that counts as a type of rulership (as I <i>proved</i> above). To put it another way, ancaps might not believe in <i>formal</i> government, but they have no problem with corporations and other <i>informal</i> governments whereas anarchists oppose <i>all</i> governments. --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 12:44, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>I have said in the past that I fall squarely in the "ancap is not anarchism" school of thought, but--criticisms notwithstanding--if we accept that <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noam_Chomsky_7341.html" title="Noam Chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a> is an anarchist, then the quote below does provide some evidence that there has been at least some degree of cooperation between anarchists and ancaps in the past. I'm not sure if that is enough to make me change my opinion, but it does bear keeping in mind as we decide what constitutes a part of the movement.</p>
<p>Excerpted from an <a href="http://www.zmag.org/chomsky/interviews/9612-anarchism.html" class="external text" title="http://www.zmag.org/chomsky/interviews/9612-anarchism.html" rel="nofollow">interview</a> in <a href="../../../z/_/m/Z_Magazine_f29c.html" title="Z Magazine">Z Magazine</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd><u>Interviewer</u>:<b>Many "anarcho-capitalists" claim that anarchism means the freedom to do what you want with your property and engage in free contract with others. Is <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalism.html" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a> in any way compatible with anarchism as you see it?</b></dd>
<dd><u>Chomsky</u>:Anarcho-capitalism, in my opinion, is a doctrinal system which, if ever implemented, would lead to forms of tyranny and oppression that have few counterparts in human history. There isn't the slightest possibility that its (in my view, horrendous) ideas would be implemented, because they would quickly destroy any society that made this colossal error. The idea of "free contract" between the <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potentate.html" title="Potentate">potentate</a> and his starving subject is a sick joke, perhaps worth some moments in an academic seminar exploring the consequences of (in my view, absurd) ideas, but nowhere else.</dd>
<dd>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I should add, however, that I find myself in substantial agreement with people who consider themselves anarcho-capitalists on a whole range of issues; and for some years, was able to write only in their journals. And I also admire their commitment to <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rationality.html" title="Rationality">rationality</a> -- which is rare -- though I do not think they see the consequences of the doctrines they espouse, or their profound <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moral.html" title="Moral">moral</a> failings. --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 15:46, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Though Chomsky is widely described as an anarchist, and certainly seems to advocate elements of anarcho-syndicalism at times, he generally describes himself not as an anarchist but as a "<a href="http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/19760725.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/19760725.htm" rel="nofollow">fellow traveler</a>". In fact I've removed direct mention of him as an anarchist from the anarchism page a couple of times for that reason, but it always finds its way back and isn't a pressing issue in my opinion given his close association with anarchism. Anyway, I'm not sure this quote demonstrates a great deal that is relevant to this template. That there are overlap ideas between anarcho-capitalists and anarchists in general is already known, anarchists and anarcho-capitalists all rail against "the state" as such, and there are many issues subordinate to that issue that are shared. However, there are also very striking differences between anarcho-capitalism and the rest of the anarchist traditions, and this has been noted by historians and anarchists and indeed anarcho-capitalists themselves for a long time. Anarcho-capitalism is at the very least a subject related to anarchism, and at most a divergent tradition within it, between those two poles is where the debate lies, probably somewhere around a divergent tradition outside of it, imho. That it is disputed or contested is something that seems rather beyond reasonable doubt. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlahblahblahblahblahblah_a472.html" title="User:Blahblahblahblahblahblah">Blahblahblahblahblahblah</a> 04:14, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Personally, I'd say it fits most clearly in the "criticisms" section. But in order for us to have a debate, we'll need to agree on some criteria with which to classify a school of thought as "divergent from" or "convergent with" and "interior to" or "exterior to" the Anarchist and/or anarchist movement and/or philosophy. So far, we're all using different criteria and I'm hoping that providing other borderline cases (like Chomsky) will tease out what criteria each player is using. Then, maybe we can get somewhere. --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 19:48, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have personally witnessed disputes as to whether Christian anarchism is a form of anarchism. My intuition says yes, but I'm not speaking from an informed POV.

If not, what is the difference between the two disputes? --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 15:54, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is disputed, but not as much as an-cap. I mean, Tolstoy was a Christian, and he is considered an anarchist by most. Although I personally dislike the idea of Christian anarchists, I would consider them (misguided) anarchists. As long as they don't try to force Christianity on others, I don't see why their own personal belief in a god should exclude them from being anarchists, but it is fairly ironic. I do have friends (who have been involved in the anarchist movement for quite some time) who were surprised to hear Christian anarchists even exist and we spent time talking about how absurd it was. I think it's absurdity comes down to what defines them as Christian though. But there are some anarchists who are very adament in saying that anarchists can't be Christian or religious (which I find to be pretty ironic as well). <font color="black"><b>The</b></font> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="green"><b>Ungovernable</b></font></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_6a81.html" title="User talk:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="black"><b>Force</b></font></a> 05:15, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't see what's so "ironic" about it. They're anarchists because they're Christian, and they interpret the bible to forbid domination over fellow human beings, and their religion as incompatible with formal institutions. They're not anarchists who just happen to be Christian, so I don't see how they're "misguided". Unless you're saying their interpretation of the bible is wrong and they should learn to appreciate the church and state like their peers. Convincing them to keep the "anarchist" part of their philosophy and ditch the "Christian" wouldn't make sense to me, since the latter feeds the former. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 18:03, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes I agree. Though I find metaphysics and spirituality as a whole objectionable on epistemological grounds, I don't see anything inherently anti-anarchic about the more liberal interpretations of Christianity or any other religion, nor do I see anything in anarchist philosophy that justifies rejecting a person because they happen to subscribe to a particular mythology. Quite the contrary. --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 18:20, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Perhaps I should explain more, because after re-reading my post and the reponses here, I think I may have not explained very well, and may have also come accross as a bit more antagonistic than I really feel. First, I tried to say an important part of this discussion is <i>why</i> they call themselves Christian and what that means to them (and same with "anarchist"). Some call themselves anarchists because they believe God should be the only authority, which seems pretty unanarchistic to me. What if I said "I'm an anarchist because the President is the only authority I will listen to"? Remember the slogan "No Gods, No Masters"? Anarchism has a long tradition of opposing churches, and in many cases religion as a whole. I have only met one Christian anarchist myself, which I fully admit is not nearly enough for me to make a reasonable and full assessment of the situation. First off, the guy I talked to was nice and definetly knew about anarchism and what it means, unlike some other self-proclaimed anarchists. At the same time, I didn't see the point of assigning such a high emphasis on Jesus, even if he did have some good things to say and had some anarchist leanings (depending on your interpretation of the Bible). Just because I really like and admire Emma Goldman doesn't mean I'm going to go around and call myself a Goldmanist and worship her as a figurehead. It just seems weird and cultish to me. And it smacks of hierarchy. And why do they believe the Bible is a legitimate source of authority, yet something like the Consitution is not? Neither seems to have more veracity than the other to me. It seems like a severe lapse in analysis to reject virtually all authority while clinging to another. But again, different people have different reasons for calling themselves Christian and I don't claim to know or understand them all. And not all Christian anarchists (or even Christians in general) necessarily fit into the model I'm describing. I'm sure there are some for whom none of these criticisms really fit, and there are probably others who deserve much more critique. And again, even for the ones who do fit into this, I don't really think it's important enough to make a big deal of, especially here on wikipedia. I don't personally understand why an anarchist would want to label themselves Christian and I find it somewhat contradictory, but whatever. As long as they don't try to force Christian morality and ideas on others I'm cool with it, since unlike anarcho-capitalists they don't advocate continued hierarchical relationship between people. <font color="black"><b>The</b></font> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="green"><b>Ungovernable</b></font></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_6a81.html" title="User talk:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="black"><b>Force</b></font></a> 07:52, 26 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Your last point is the key distinction. Besides, I don't see Christianity as a truly heirarchical system; it's just a metaphoric heirarchy. Much like if I were to say "I want to devote my life to anarchist principles" or "I totally worship Milla Jovovich". That's all fine, as long as you don't make other people do it too. In fact, even if you truly did want to live a life of submission to somebody else, I don't see a problem with it as long as you don't insist other people do the same and as long as you haven't been coerced into making that choice or maintaining that position--and that's where the opposition to Church comes in. --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 09:35, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Capitalism destroys democracy because only the ones with the $$$$$$ are able to participate. Capitalism is undemocratic because it takes poor people out of democracy. Capitalism is undemocratic because it lets people steal land and water and other things that belong equally to everybody. Capitalism is anti-democracy and capitalism is anti-anarchism. Actually, I'm so democratic that I haven't deleted anarcho-capitalism from the template yet. If we weren't anarchists, we would just make the change without listening to your opinion (you know, like you said you were going to do). So, I gave a handful of reasons why capitalism is anti-democratic. Maybe you could explain why I'm wrong, or even give one reason why you think capitalism is a good thing.

Nobody has a right to tell you that. That is your decision. In an anarchist system, you would also be able to decide what bread you want to buy. Not only that, but in anarchism, if you thought your favorite bread had gone downhill, you would have the right to fix the problem by going down to the factory to take part in the decisions about how the bread is made. You would probably be able to participate in a discussion very much like the one we're having right now, where everyone gets to say what they think and we won't make decisions until we've all had a chance to talk about it first. As a customer of the bread company, you are affected by the decisions made at that company, therefore you have a right to be a part of those decisions. I happen to live a couple of miles away from the Wonder Bread factory, but if I went down there and asked to speak with the owner about the way they make bread, they'd laugh in my face. In fact, in capitalism, somebody could come along and buy the bread company and close it down, and I would never have a chance to buy that bread again and I would never have a chance to tell them I want them to keep making my favorite bread. In capitalism, only the people with the money can make important decisions. Am I wrong? Then tell me why. If not, then how can you say capitalism is democratic? Anyway, to answer your question...voting can be democratic, <u>if</u> everybody gets an equal vote. Under capitalism, we all get to vote, but only the rich people get to have dinner with the senators and tell them what the policies should be. That's not democracy at all. --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 22:39, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Unfortunately, I have to say I find myself siding with Intangible on the reference issue. Even though it is completely and utterly obvious that anarcho-capitalism is disputed, and even though it is completely and nearly-utterly obvious that anarcho-capitalism is inherently anti-anarchist, I have to agree that we'll need to demonstrate those facts referentially before we can justify what amounts to censoring a minority opinion. However, we can't just throw quotes back and forth at each other because the references themselves use the term "anarchism" in several different ways, and we'll have to be clear about what *we* mean by anarchism for the purposes of this article.

<dd>Well, if you can find a source saying that most anarchists DON'T think anarcho-capitalism is an oxymoron, be my guest. But honestly I don't think you could find such a thing. As much as you might consider it legitimate, or work to convince us that it fits neatly within anarchism, the fact remains that most anarchists see it as nonsensical. It isn't our place to throw around arguments.

<dd>Then give a decent source that supports your argument. I have given three sources, one being Encarta, one being an article in a scholarly journal, and one from a book written by a RIT professor, all talking about anarcho-capitalism as being part of anarchism. This book by a free-lance journalist simply does not cut it. I am not saying that there is no dispute between the anarcho-communists and the anarcho-capitalists, I do say however that they both are forms of anarchism.

<dd><b>+</b>A note on citing sources...it's not enough (for either side of the debate) to cite incidental mentions of anarcho-capitalism here an there--which is all anybody has supplied so far. Rather, we need to find examples of fully fleshed-out arguments from non-anarchist sources for one side or the other because incidental mentions in literature present no way of identifying the quality of the source material or the expertise of the writer, and non-anarchist sources are less likely to be biassed. Unfortunately, we know that any detailed argument about this particular topic is likely to be politically biassed because almost nobody outside of anarchism or anarcho-capitalism has seen fit to take up this debate.</dd>
<dd><b>+</b>However, there is more than one way to resolve this. All we have to do is to is to cite non-anarchist writers who consider anarchism a type of socialism. If we can agree that anarcho-capitalism is not a type of socialism, then we know that the experts wouldn't call it a type of anarchism.

<dd>I don't know if I agree. The individualist/collectivist split was a basic sticking point in early anarchism. I still think the individualists were socialists by and large, but I'd have to see some source material to be sure.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The false "individualist versus collectivist" dichotomy"</span></h2>
<p>The individualist versus collectivist dichotomy was first introduced into these various articles by banned users <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> and <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a>. The problem is that it's not a very good dichotomy, as it doesn't really make much sense to divide anarchist philosophies into individualist versus collectivist ones. Those editors basically used it as an excuse to lump <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalism</a> in with <a href="../../../i/n/d/Individualist_anarchism.html" title="Individualist anarchism">individualist anarchism</a> and then juxtapose them to all of the rest (most notably <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-communism.html" title="Anarcho-communism">anarcho-communism</a>). But the most prominent anarcho-communist, <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Kropotkin_48a3.html" title="Peter Kropotkin">Peter Kropotkin</a>, is described as follows by Charles A. Madison in "Anarchism in the United States," taken from the <i>Journal of the History of Ideas</i>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Since it was in the very nature of government to exercise constraint, they were opposed to any communal organization which arrogated authority over its individual members. Peter Kropotkin, perhaps the most persuasive exponent of this doctrine, defined it as 'the most complete developmennt of individuality combined with the highest development of voluntary association in all its aspects, in all possible degrees, in all imaginable aims; ever changing, ever modified associations which carry in themselves the elements of their durability and constantly assume new forms which answer best to the multiple aspirations of all.'</i><a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0022-5037%28194501%296%3A1%3C46%3AAITUS%3E2.0.CO%3B2-H&amp;size=LARGE" class="external autonumber" title="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0022-5037%28194501%296%3A1%3C46%3AAITUS%3E2.0.CO%3B2-H&amp;size=LARGE" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></dd>

<p>Hardly sounds like a collectivist, <i>tout court</i>, to me, because he defended and aspired to the same individualistic ideals as the individualists did. The point is that opposition to capitalism does not immediately entail collectivism in the Marxist or Communist sense. --AaronS 21:57, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>From the Blackwell Dictionary of Modern Social Thought (2006): "However, his [Proudhon] successors, Michael A. Bakunin and Peter A. Kropotkin in Russia, substituted for his 'mutualism' first 'collectivism' and then 'communism' — the latter implying 'everything belongs to everyone' and distribution according to needs."</dd>
<dd>The Dictionary earlier stated: "Repudiation of rulers is at the core of anarchism. In developing this negative notion, modern anarchists, broadly classifiable as either individualist or socialist, reject the state, hold that social order is possible in its absence and advocate moving directly towards 'society without the state'...Anarchists take John Locke's view that 'the natural condition of mankind', in which all are free and equal, no-one having the right to command obedience of others, does constitute a society...In distinguishing sharply between society and state, both individualist and socialist anarchism build on liberal foundations. The former may be seen as liberalism taken to an extreme, or logical, conclusion...nineteenth-century individualists sometimes thought of themselves as socialists. But their successors today, such as Murray Rothbard (1973), having abandonded the labour theory of value, describe themselves as 'anarcho-capitalists'.</dd>
<dd>Then concluding: "A generation after the eclipse of anarcho-syndicalism, anarchist ideas reemerged, sometimes spectacularly, in the context of the New Left movements of the 1960s...At the other end of the political spectrum, individualist anarchism, reborn as anarcho-capitalism, is a significant tendency in the libertarian New Right."
<dl>
<dd>QED. Please stop this nonsense talking about anarcho-capitalism being not a form of anarchism. I have provided sufficient sources that say so, and I think the above template is a nice compromise, since anarcho-capitalism, if you like or not, is the rebirth of individualist anarchism (although there is some continuity with the work of <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Jay_Nock_8c54.html" title="Albert Jay Nock">Albert Jay Nock</a>).

<dd>Yes, the discussion below seems to be working in the direction of compromise. However, I would point out that to solve the matter of whether ancaps are anarchists requires more than citing some dictionary or encyclopedia. It involves going to original sources and tracing whose ideas were used by whom. That being said, I think Intangible's citation makes puts the case for ancap in a much better light.

<p>Another quote, this time from the Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought (1991): "Individualist anarchism has recently been revived, and now forms part of the broader movement known as libertarianism. But while the earlier individualists thought that a society of equal freedom would radically modify capitalism, their modern descendants celebrate that system, and often describe themselves as 'anarcho-capitalists', a phrase that attracts vitriolic condemnation from anarchists of other persuasions." Then later: "A student and disciple of the Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises, Rothbard combined the laissez-faire economics of his teacher with the absolutist views of human rights and rejection of the state he absorbed from studying the individualist American anarchists of the nineteenth century such as Lysander Spooner and Benjamin Tucker. (Rothbard himself is on the anarchist wing of the movemement [libertarianism].) Both by his writings and by personal influence, Rothbard is the principal founder of modern libertarianism."

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, this quote is much more developed, but to my mind, the acceptance of the labor theory of value is what made individualist anarchists socialist (perhaps even marxist). So, whatever Rothbard took from individualist anarchism, the rejection of the core economic theory represents at minimum a radical break with anarchism proper...such that it really should be considered a brand new philosophy. I wouldn't mind calling it a sort of "pseudo-anarchism" or "para-anarchism". Maybe even "neo-anarchism" if it weren't for the fact that there are already people calling the other modern movements "neo-anarchism". Also note that your source recognizes the huge gulf between ancaps and anarchists, so it is still reasonable to label ancap as "disputed"--unless you don't think "vitriolic condemnation" counts as a dispute. Perhaps we should abandon "disputed" and put in a nice header that says <i><b>Universally Condemned Schools of Anarchism</b></i>. Or maybe just "<a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> (condemned)". It has a nice ring to it. The other thing I find interesting is that your source says Rothbard is the founder of modern libertarianism, which seems to reinforce what I've been saying all along...that ancaps are more accurately described as neolibertarians. Unless you want to say that neolibertarianism is an offshoot of anarchism. That sounds kind of nice too; the ifluence of anarchism on today's political landscape is sadly underappreciated. --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 04:40, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>From the Dictionary of Marxist Thought (1992): "Although anarchism rests on liberal intellectual foundations, notably the distinction between state and society, the protean character of the doctrine makes it difficult to disinguish clearly different schools of anarchist thought. But one important distinction is between individualist anarchism and social anarchism. The former emphasizes individual liberty, the sovereignty of the individual, the importance of private property or possession, and the iniquity of all monopolies. It may be seen as liberalism taken to an extreme conclusion. 'Anarcho-capitalism' is a contemporary variant of this school." Intangible 17:19, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">This is a navigation template</span></h2>
<p>This template is to help readers find different topics under the broad umbrella of anarchism. Regardless of whether a capitalist system will result in controlling state-like entities, it is a rather non-minor philosophy that has at least the idea of eliminating the over-arching monopoly state. Regardless of whether it has the lineage of more socialistic political thought, it remains under the broader idea of no state and is a philosophy that a prospective reader will look for under anarchism. The presence of <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalism</a> in the template is not tantamount to a statement that it is the culmination of anarchist thought, and it can be always placed in a separate section of the template. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 22:19, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with you completely. There is nothing wrong, however, with noting that anarcho-capitalism is disputed. It's information. Further, <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a> has never simply been opposition to the state (that's <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-statism.html" title="Anti-statism">anti-statism</a>), but rather opposition to all coercive authority. --AaronS 22:24, 29 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, anarcho-capitalism is opposed to all coercive authority, but it has a different idea of what constitutes coercion than other anarchist philosophies have. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 22:29, 29 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Which is at the center of the dispute, I imagine. Anarcho-capitalist non-normative interpretations of concepts like coercion are also at the heart of the featured article status review discussion of the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalism</a> article. --AaronS 22:33, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If that answer is "Anarchism," I still don't see a need to asterisk it or list it as "disputed." Nav templates are there for ease of navigation, not to inform. If it's so urgent to make it obvious, make a subheader on the template for "Disputes" and include such articles as <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_and_anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism">Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism</a> under it to underscore the debate.--<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosicrucian_a63e.html" title="User:Rosicrucian">Rosicrucian</a> 02:48, 30 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's a very good point about navigation, and I suppose that I wasn't considering the importance of that. Perhaps your idea is a good one. Another question, I imagine, is whether or not it belongs under the header of "traditions." Is anarcho-capitalism an anarchist tradition, per se? Or is it a politico-economic theory that was influenced by anarchism? As of today, anarcho-capitalism has no movement and hasn't really done anything outside of academia and the Internet discussion forums, whereas other anarchist traditions, in the proper sense of the word, have affected international politics and world history. Are these differences significant? --AaronS 03:48, 30 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I agree the template is supposed to be navigational. As such, the current one is not doing a very good job since it excludes many of the ideas a reader might genuinely be looking for when he/she looks up the word "anarchism", including anomie, lawlessness, disorder, punk rock, Molotov cocktails, assassination, destruction, etc. If the template is purely navigational, then it makes sense to simply make a judgement-free list all of these things alphabetically without imposing an order on it. However, I do think the template has a secondary, informational function, reflected in our tendency to split it up into subheads...the same is true on other templates within politics. So, the question isn't whether anarcho-capitalism belongs on the template, but how it is grouped in relation to the traditionally recognized branches of anarchism. If we group it closely with them, then not only are we violating NPOV by weighting the ancap perspective too heavily, but we would also be violating accuracy requirements by implying a factually incorrect picture of its relationship to anarchism proper. It's the "Jews for Jesus" problem. --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 04:28, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Question, why is anarcho-primitivism not in the first area? Isn't a type of post-left and green anarchism? Is there something about it that makes it "anarchist influenced" (like an-cap) rather than anarchism? I know some people don't like it (and I have some problems with parts of it) but I'm not sure why it's in that section. Also, post-left anarchism is on there twice (under Modern Anarchism and Anarchist Theory). <font color="black"><b>The</b></font> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="green"><b>Ungovernable</b></font></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_6a81.html" title="User talk:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="black"><b>Force</b></font></a> 05:54, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Aaron's not the one who put it there; I did. The duplication of post-left anarchism was unintentional, but as it happens, it illustrates a nice point. If we break up the template into different sections, it's likely that some philosophies/submovements may fall in more than one category. As for anarcho-primitivism, I'm inclined to accept it into the fold though I have huge problems with its implications. However, I know there is debate in some quarters as to whether it's part of anarchism proper. The question has been mentioned in a couple of talks at the <a href="../../../i/n/s/Institute_for_Anarchist_Studies_4201.html" title="Institute for Anarchist Studies">Institute for Anarchist Studies</a>' R.A.T. conferences, and Bookchin's argued strongly against it. I don't know much about the history of the movement, but several primitivist travelers who held a meeting at a squat in my hometown mentioned <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodore_Kaczynski_7c14.html" title="Theodore Kaczynski">Theodore Kaczynski</a> as one of the key thinkers in the founding of the philosophy. If that's the case, and if anarcho-primitivism differs significantly from traditional branches of anarchism, then we have a situation parallel to anarcho-capitalism. Namely, a founder whose ideas are not founded on anarchist principles and a movement that only bears a superficial similarity to anarchism proper. Anyway, it's sufficiently controversial that I'd like to see a debate on the subject. Go ahead and edit the template as you see fit--that was Aaron's suggestion, and I'd like to see people adding links to a much larger number of potentially-related articles because the more examples we have, I think, the more likely the concepts will sort themselves out into an intuitive order. --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 13:18, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Bookchin isn't even an anarchist anymore (by their own admission). I'm not sure Kaczynski really started it. I thought Zerzan was probably one of the major founders (although he later became friends with Kaczynski). I could be wrong of course. I do agree it is contentious though, so I can understand not putting it in.

<dl>
<dd>Bookchin not an anarchist? Hadn't heard that. Yeah, I think anarcho-primitivism is harmless enough to put up with, and I think their vision has some nice asthetics, but they're definitely fringe. Which is not to say that eco-anarchism or Green anarchism are fringe...on the contrary, I don't know of any anarchists (except ancaps) who don't consider themselves eco-friendly, and sometimes/oftentimes that manifests itself a mild sort of luddism. I only mention it because (for some reason) people seem to lump primitivists into the environmentalist camp, but the connection is slim. Primitivists are an entirely different order of luddites. Primitivists will say things like "we oppose civilization as a whole" or "language is patriarchy". At least the ones I met. I was impressed by their ability to facilitate large group discussion and the roadkill-raccoon soup wasn't too bad either. --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 11:37, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The biggest problem with this template, clearly, is that it's gigantic. Even how it is now it's probably too large. I'd suggest dumping the "Associated Concepts" section right out, although even then it's still too large. As Ungovernable suggested, post-left anarchism isn't needed along with post-left anarchy. I also don't see why "anarcho-primitivism" (actually a misnomor; it's just primitivism) is marginalized to inspired movements. Although I'm regionally biased, where I am saying you're an anarchist will have most people assuming you're a primitivist, green, eco-anarchist, or post-leftist. Or most often, some configuration along those lines. So from my standpoint, it's somewhat bewildering. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 18:29, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I've seen bigger templates work decently, like <a href="../../../s/c/i/Template%7EScientologySeries_dce9.html" title="Template:ScientologySeries">Template:ScientologySeries</a> or <a href="../../../c/h/r/Template%7EChristianity_d7bc.html" title="Template:Christianity">Template:Christianity</a>. Might be more of a layout task than trimming. I'll agree that "Associated Concepts" seems to paint with too broad a brush, and many items there should be trimmed out, or possibly the subsection eliminated entirely. Still, it might be good to look at other successful large nav templates for guidance.--<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosicrucian_a63e.html" title="User:Rosicrucian">Rosicrucian</a> 18:35, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually it does not. It only talks about revolutionary anarchism. Someone like <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proudhon.html" title="Proudhon">Proudhon</a> or <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Tucker_454b.html" title="Benjamin Tucker">Benjamin Tucker</a> would have balked at the "associated concepts." See also my earlier point of today above. Intangible 19:36, 30 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But if we say that the template's purpose is mainly navigational, then we need to include things that people associate with anarchism, rightly or wrongly. The differences can be tackled in the respective articles. I do think "Historical tendencies" is a little problematic...doesn't seem like the right term. Maybe these topics can be put under a header along the lines of "Anarchist approaches". Intangible, what "non-revolutionary" anarchism are you refering to? If there's something you'd like to add to the proposed template, go ahead. --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 19:39, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I might move the Individualists out of "Anarchism Today," given that most Individualists these days are instead Anarcho-capitalists or some other flavor. Other than that, as above we might tweak the text size on the individual entries, and spiff up the presentation a little. Such a big block of grey gets a little monotonous. As for Proudhon or Tucker, as discussed above this is a nav template not a philosophical debate. While I can agree as I said above that we are perhaps casting our net too wide on "Associated Concepts," I do not believe we have to go back to Proudhon for everything when we're aiming for ease of navigability.--<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosicrucian_a63e.html" title="User:Rosicrucian">Rosicrucian</a> 19:43, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that it seems strange to put the individualists in "Anarchism Today" since that was basically a nineteenth century movement. I might agree that the "Associated concepts" header may be a little too broad, but at least some of the concepts (anomie, and especially the autonomen, for example) are near enough to anarchism to warrant mention. --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 19:50, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmmm. I'm not sure what you're getting at here. To hold an ideology...<i>any</i> idiology is by definition prescriptivist. However, the post you replied to asserts no right or wrong position, it simply points out a narrower use of the term individualist. --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 15:54, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Relevant Lists" looks awkward being the only one not condensed to have more than one item per line. Also, maybe we could try bullets instead of pipe characters?--<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosicrucian_a63e.html" title="User:Rosicrucian">Rosicrucian</a> 21:11, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Anarcho-capitalism can't be in the "Offshoots" section since more than enough scholars say that it's a form of anarchism and those who deny that it also deny that it came from anarchist tradition - so who actually claims that AC is an offshoot of anarchism? Further, why is <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-primitivism.html" title="Anarcho-primitivism">anarcho-primitivism</a> in that section? Judging by its article, nobody is denying that it's a form of anarchism. Section "Historical approaches" also looks like an OR to me. What the "historical approaches" should mean? As for associated concepts, they are too numerous to be in a template. They might be added in "Relevant lists" in form of a special article. <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVision_Thing_6e8a.html" title="User:Vision Thing">-- Vision Thing --</a> 20:20, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline">Too wide!</span></h4>
<p>As it stands right now, the anarchism template that we're playing with is <i>way</i> too wide. It loses its beauty when it gets too wide (it reads best visually when it's long and slender), and you also run the risk of crowding out your articles with a navigation sidebar. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchuminweb_da4b.html" title="User:Schuminweb">SchuminWeb</a> (<a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchuminweb_e3cb.html" title="User talk:Schuminweb">Talk</a>) 03:11, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would be interested in "associated concepts", as that seems to me like a good place to do some cutting, either to trim it, or cut it out altogether, since a few of those connections are kind of weak. Additionally, I'm of the belief that any redlinks do not belong in a proper template. So that would strike a good bit of it right there and bring it down to size, both long and wide. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchuminweb_da4b.html" title="User:Schuminweb">SchuminWeb</a> (<a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchuminweb_e3cb.html" title="User talk:Schuminweb">Talk</a>) 22:53, 31 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree that broken links should not appear on the template, but I think at least three of the red links are active and important enough to stay, even if we need to put up a stub article temporarily. Namely <a href="http://nefac.net/node/1385" class="external text" title="http://nefac.net/node/1385" rel="nofollow">Especifismo</a>, <a href="http://www.nefac.net/node/1386" class="external text" title="http://www.nefac.net/node/1386" rel="nofollow">Social Insertion</a> (what I've heard called "Insertionism"), and Anarchsm by country. I think the template as it stands, as well as the sandbox template below are strongly eurocentric, which is particularly problematic since the most active areas of anarchism in the last 30 years (and the source of inspiration for the current upswing of anarchism in North America today) has been the South American anarchist experience. --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 23:13, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Offshoots" sounds like these forms have a pedigree. I still stand behind my first suggestion of the template (collectivist, individualist, other), possibly added with "anarchism in culture" and "relevant lists" and "anarchist theory." The "Associated Concepts" can go imho. Proudhon had "kind words" to say about slavery... Intangible 19:22, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

I was aiming at something reminiscent of the black and red, but less high-contrast with the burgundy version but I personally find it kind of ugly.

<p>Sorry to say this but new colors suck. The newest version is the best one but red and black are anarcho-syndicalist colors and it's better to avoid bias were it's possible.

<p>I don't like the quasi-A image on the one in the middle. It's a nice image, but I've never seen it in use (other than on Aelffin's user-page) so it isn't really a notable anarchist symbol. I'd use the circle-A like we always have. I like the color-scheme on the right. The left one is good too. <font color="black"><b>The</b></font> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="green"><b>Ungovernable</b></font></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_6a81.html" title="User talk:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="black"><b>Force</b></font></a> 20:46, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>On the designs as currently presented, I like the left one and would move to implement it on the production template. This is the one in "papayawhip", as I suggested. That combines black with a "neutral" color, and just looks nice. The middle design that replaces the circle-A with <a href="../../../b/w/_/Image%7EBw_anarchsit_flag.jpg_4b90.html" title="Image:Bw anarchsit flag.jpg">Image:Bw anarchsit flag.jpg</a> just looks strange. The new image reminds me greatly of the <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kampgrounds_of_America_bd9c.html" title="Kampgrounds of America">KOA</a> logo. The right-side design, the "green" version, is aesthetically pleasing, but I just can't see its going on a page like <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-syndicalism.html" title="Anarcho-syndicalism">anarcho-syndicalism</a> with a strong bit of red on it. I just see it as potentially being too aesthetically clashing with some of the material on other pages.</p>

<li>I like the beige best, except the portal part at the bottom should match the theme (i.e. should be white text on a black background.) I still don't see how primitivism is an "offshoot", though. It's certainly no more an offshoot than post-left anarchism, with which it shares some key similarities. Although on another note, I think the "associated concepts" should be scratched altogether.

<li>The white one does look nice, but if it's going to look right, it needs that overall wraparound border to provide a white background across the whole thing. Otherwise, it visually narrows and has a break in it in the space where the "A" exists, since the background otherwise is <i>not quite</i> white. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchuminweb_da4b.html" title="User:Schuminweb">SchuminWeb</a> (<a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchuminweb_e3cb.html" title="User talk:Schuminweb">Talk</a>) 17:21, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree; this needs to be hashed out. As does the anarcho-capitalism issue. I think the new content is an improvement over the current template in that it makes a compromise on ancap (no disclaimer/no association), and it includes a few new hot topics in contemporary anarchism. I think there are two proper ways to go about organizing this information: Historical/Sociological or Theoretical/Philosophical. The first would organize based on which movements evolved from which while the second would organize based on the conceptual similarities between the different categories. --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 19:17, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Those who deny that anarcho-capitalism is not a form of anarchism do not necessarily deny that it was inspired by anarchism or came from anarchist tradition; moreover, hardly more than enough scholars say that it <i>is</i> a form of anarchism. It has also not been shown that anarcho-capitalism exists outside of the Internet. There are anarcho-capitalists, of course, but do they ever take their philosophy from their web sites and blogs and do something with it? How has anarcho-capitalism affected history? How has it changed politics? How has it changed philosophy? Perhaps the solution is to not have any divisions and simply list everything either chronologically or alphabetically, but I doubt it. --AaronS 01:16, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wikipedia is based on verifiability, can someone provide sources that anarcho-capitalism is an offshoot (defined as "a natural consequence of development") of anarchism and at the same time not a form of anarchism? As for sources for claim that anarcho-capitalism is a form of anarchism, I can provide a dozen of them. Further, anarcho-capitalism is an individualist philosophy and individualists, in general, are not very eager to join a mass-movements or organizations. Their self-reliance and independence from collective are characteristics that make them individualists. Idea that someone needs to be a party member to be taken into consideration is a collectivist bias. <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVision_Thing_6e8a.html" title="User:Vision Thing">-- Vision Thing --</a> 11:39, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm really confused. First---anarchism has a name, it's called anarchism. Socialism is called socialism. Second---you clearly have a different definition of "movement" from mine. In my understanding (and everywhere else I've seen), both socialism and anarchism are political movements, philosophical movements, and social movements. I doubt you could find many sources that contradict this. Anarchism is also a minor <i>cultural</i> movement and socialism is a <i>major</i> cultural movement. Each consists of a large number of sub-movements, both internal and offshoots and each is a member of a number of larger movements, including libertarianism and Enlightenment philosophy. Even just looking on Wikipedia, we can see...
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_movement.html" title="Political movement">Political movement</a> says: "Classic examples include abolitionism, anarchism, the women's suffrage, the Labour movement, universal suffrage movements and anticolonialist movements."</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_movement.html" title="Social movement">Social movement</a> says: "Social movements are a type of group action. They are large informal groupings of individuals and/or organizations focused on specific political or social issues, in other words, on carrying out, resisting or undoing a social change."</li>
<li><a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophical_movement.html" title="Philosophical movement">Philosophical movement</a> says: "What makes a movement identifiable and interesting as distinct from a specific theory is simply that a movement consists in a large flourishing of intellectual work on one or more ideas, in a fairly specifiable time and place."</li>

<dd><i>Of course</i> liberalism and conservatism are movements...in all of the senses above. This is trivial and universal. I can't believe you're arguing this, Intangible. If the definitions I've given are not enough, then tell me what is <i>your</i> definition of "movement"? Just tell me what you mean, because what you're saying is extremely confusing. <a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 17:35, 10 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There were of course more definitions at that page...Anyways, for me, for something to be a political movement, there needs to be a historic naming (such as "<a href="../../../p/r/o/Provo.html" title="Provo">Provo</a>") that separates people from other people. Although you probably would claim that anarchism would create such a separation, I beg to differ, there are certainly anarchists who have not been part of a movement. Come to mind, most individualist anarchists were certainly not, since they did not take part in any collective activism. Intangible 23:24, 10 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>And, of course all of those other definitions fall well within the boundaries of one or more of the definitions of "movement" that I supplied several posts ago. Taking part in collective action (according to the Wikipedia article) is part of the definition of a <i>social</i> movement. At least some individualists were certainly part of the anarchist <i>social</i> movement. However, <i>all</i> individualists were part of the anarchist <i>philosophical</i> movement because they interacted with and based their theories on one another. While anarcho-capitalism certainly is a philisophical movement in its own right, but I have yet to see any evidence that it is actually based on the traditional anarchist philosophical movement. It certainly is not part of the current or historical anarchist social movement, nor the current anarchist cultural movement. <a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 13:43, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But, Vision Thing, there are individualists who decidedly have changed philosophy, and who have become internationally known as a result of their application of their philosophy to their life, work, or legacy. Henry David Thoreau, who wrote "the book" on self-reliance, comes to mind; his tax revolt and experiment on Walden Pond are well-known, at least in the United States. From my understanding, individualists are not individualists because they don't like other people or don't like cooperating with others; they're individualists, because they do not want to be <i>forced</i> to do so, and would like to have a choice in the matter. In this regard, individualists and collectivists agree, which is why the individualist-collectivist dichotomy very poorly describes anarchism. All anarchist philosophies are individualist; even the most "collectivist" forms have as their pinnacle goal the complete liberation of the individual. Even Marxism -- the paradigm of collectivism -- has this as its final goal. So, I think that it's a lame excuse to say that anarcho-capitalism is not prevelant in the real world simply because it's an individualist philosophy.</dd>
<dd>You're correct that "offshoot" probably is not the proper term. But anarcho-capitalism is not yet a movement, never has been a movement, and its influence has been mainly restricted to the Internet, Wikipedia included. And when I say "movement," I do not simply mean social movement; I also mean philosophical and political movement. How has anarcho-capitalism changed philosophy? Politics? Society? It is a socio-political philosophy. It must be measured on socio-politico-philosophical grounds.</dd>
<dd>As for its relation to anarchism, it was inspired by anarchism. But anarchists, for the most part, have wholeheartedly rejected it. Consider this (probably very poor) analogy: pretend that the Protestant Reformation is occurring now. Up until this point, the only deal in town for Christianity was Catholicism. Martin Luther posts his theses on the door, and it causes a stir. Protestantism, however, has not yet swept the world; it has, for the most part, yet to leave that door. It is confined to a few circles, and the vast majority of Christians reject it as against their beliefs. If this were happening now, it would be unencyclopaedic for Wikipedia to give undue weight to Martin Luther's theses. Wikipedia would then be acting as a soapbox for Protestantism. Now, this of course is not how the Reformation occurred, and anarchism is not a religion, but I believe that the analogy provides some sense of where some of us, who are trying to be neutral, are coming from. --AaronS 12:54, 8 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You are right about individualist-collectivist dichotomy. However, as for influence of anarcho-capitalism on philosophy, politics and society, it seems that you don't apply the same criteria on anarcho-capitalism as on other recent anarchist movements.

</dd>
<dd><b>To the anarchists:</b> While I agree that it's obvious that ancaps are not anarchists, I have to point out the fact that we--myself included--have not done our homework here. Vision Thing is acting in good faith, citing sources, doing the footwork. We need to do the same. Vision's sources may be totally naive on the subject of anarchism, but I have seen almost no sources at all from the anarchists here. Come on, we can do better than that. Sure, encyclopedias and dictionaries are always inaccurate about anarchism, but there are anarchist books out there and some of them must have dealt with the issue of anarcho-capitalism. Furthermore, there have been plenty of anarchist periodicals over the years, and these are probably more representative of the movement as a whole. Doesn't somebody have some back issues of Northeastern Anarchist laying around? If we can't resolve this through citing sources, I see no alternative but to split the page into <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_%28movement%29.html" title="Anarchism (movement)">Anarchism (movement)</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_%28philosophy%29.html" title="Anarchism (philosophy)">anarchism (philosophy)</a>, keeping traditional anarchism in the first, and all the new upstarts in the second.</dd>
<dd><b>To the ancaps:</b> Look, the confusion is understandable. It's called anarcho-capitalism, its ostensibly anti-government, even encyclopedias describe it as a type of anarchism. So why shouldn't it be called a type of anarchism on Wikipedia? Good question. Look at it from our viewpoint...imagine a doctor comes to your house one day with a hampster and announces that this is your new daughter. He presents a birth certificate and a blood test, "proving" the hampster to be your very own offspring. Normally, that sort of verification is hard to deny...but it's a <i>hampster</i> for god's sake! The idea that this could be your daughter flies in the face of everything you know about everything. You would insist that the birth certificate is mistaken, if not outright fake, the blood test must have been performed incorrectly. In short, you need a <i>greater</i> standard of evidence for such an unusual claim. The same is true here. All anarchists *except* ancaps know with total certainty that anarchism is anticapitalist and always has been. If you find some encyclopedia that says otherwise, it's obviously wrong. So, you need higher than normal standards of evidence...you need source material. Primary, not secondary. I think if you could find Goldman or Bookchin or somebody to explain exactly how anarcho-capitalism comes out of anarchism proper, or if you could explain in detail how Rothbard supposedly derived his philosophy from anarchism, or if you could find examples of anarchists working with anarcho-capitalists or anarcho-capitalists supporting other anarchists or having *any* sort of contact with the movement other than some tenuous theoretical link, then we'd accept a compromise. But short of that, it sounds like you and Rothbard alike are just making things up and using shoddy sources to back it up. And even in the unlikely event that it turns out to be some fringe sort of anarchism, then that still doesn't make it notable enough to dedicate an entire subheading in the article. --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 13:28, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

As for tradition, some scholars claim that anarcho-capitalism is a modern version of individualist anarchism, and anarcho-capitalists often see Benjamin Tucker and other individualists as important figures for contemporary ac philosophy. <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVision_Thing_6e8a.html" title="User:Vision Thing">-- Vision Thing --</a> 20:10, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>"If a treaveller, in a hot day, stop at a farmhouse for a drink of water, he generally gets it without any thought of price. Why? Because it costs nothing, or the cost is immaterial...[t]he water or the wine must posess a value to the reciever...but to make this value or worth the measure of its price constitutes a glaring iniquity of the case, and would class the farmer among the wreckers of Norway, who first sink rocks in order to wreck vessels, and then demand of the crews all their cargoes and vessels for saving their lives...[and] it would class him with flour-dealers and every other huckster of provisions or clothing, with bankers and all other moneymongers and systematic speculators...[t]he only difference between them is that the wrecker must know that he ought to be shot, while the others may suppose that they are following a very 'legitimate business'!" --Josiah Warren</li>

<dd>1) Your quotes prove that individualist anarchist supported labor theory of value, and today's anarcho-capitalists support subjective theory of value. However, labor theory of value is contested by most current economists, and even by some Marxists. Economic theory evolves and it would be self-destructive to support erroneous theories.</dd>
<dd>2) Writers of the <i>An Anarchist FAQ</i> claim that implementation of individualist anarchism would lead to capitalism. Also, by <i>An anarchist FAQ</i>, Kropotkin claimed that Tucker's ideas are "a combination of the <b>anarchist</b> Proudhon's and the liberal <b>capitalist</b> Herbert Spencer's".</dd>
<dd>3) Tucker supported private property and free market claiming that: "Anarchism is a word without meaning, unless it includes the liberty of the individual to control his product or whatever his product has brought him through exchange in a free market - that is, private property. Whoever denies private property is of necessity an Archist." And private property and free market are cornerstones of anarcho-capitalism. <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVision_Thing_6e8a.html" title="User:Vision Thing">-- Vision Thing --</a> 19:33, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As for anarchism being a "political movement." Where do the individualist anarchists fit into this picture? As far as I understand, they hated the organizational forms of the communist anarchists (and their tactics of violence!). No political movement for them. Intangible 16:40, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>By getting involved in what you believe in, be that opposition to taxes, or workers' rights, e.g. <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Labadie_23f5.html" title="Joseph Labadie">Joseph Labadie</a> - <a href="../../../f/-/m/User%7EF-m-t_02fb.html" title="User:F-m-t">FrancisTyers</a> <a href="../../../f/-/m/User_talk%7EF-m-t_cc17.html" title="User talk:F-m-t">·</a> 23:20, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sure, if you do it actively, and in cohort with other people who are doing the same — consider the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poll_tax.html#United_Kingdom" title="Poll tax">movement against the Poll tax</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poll_Tax_Riots_b4f5.html" title="Poll Tax Riots">Poll Tax Riots</a> in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>.

<dd>That was a movement against specific kind of tax.
