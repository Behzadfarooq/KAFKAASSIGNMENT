<p>to me it seems obvious that anal bleaching - if it exists - is be done because dark skin around the anus might look like the result of poor wiping habits, especially on video. thus a dark anus could make a porn film less pleasant to look at for those who prefer to see clean anii. however, not beeing a porn star myself nor knowing one, nor having found any reference to support this hypothesis on the web i will not put it in the article as a fact. if someone can confirm it, however, it would be interesting. (actually i came to this article because i hoped it could confirm this in the first place) <a href="../../../g/b/r/User%7EGbrandt_c34d.html" title="User:Gbrandt">gbrandt</a> 15:54, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I had always thought that darker skin was poor wiping habits. I guess most of what I do see happens to be women with this procedure preformed. <a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPirateMonkey_e395.html" title="User:PirateMonkey">PirateMonkey</a> 00:23, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Still not much real evidence of this actually being a real thing &amp; not a hoax. Most references are circular reporting, most google links point to hoax aspect, even au article linked focuses on feasability of skin bleaching, does not mention people actuially doing this, &amp; points out that this would take much longer than the other articles claim. Yet another article detracting from Wiki quality - need to get some less POV, state facts in proper context, and {{fact}}. Additionally, how proper is it to use gossip collumnists as 'proof'? Shall we start citing 'News of the World' as a primary source next? <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBridesmill_4b81.html" title="User:Bridesmill">Bridesmill</a> 02:27, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hm is there some kind of Wikipedia macro or similar to mark this article as disputed. i think there is some kind of "factual basis disputed" macro. it should be marked like that. in any case, the article should stay, even if it is a hoax or urban legend. i've been to parties where people discussed it as the latest craze as if it was real. this is of course no proof that it is, but its a sign that at least the meme is real and important enough to be documented in here. <a href="../../../g/b/r/User%7EGbrandt_c34d.html" title="User:Gbrandt">gbrandt</a> 10:50, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Yes, if as a hoax it fits meme status, but the article needs to be clear that the origins (if not the current status) of this are hoax - it's all becoming quite interesting as there are <b>some</b> signs that if not totally for real, some people believe it enough to be interested in the procedure, including some products (prob not much more credible than the famous 'spurious spanish fly' of yore) And all of it based on thin air. From cult anthro perspective, actually quite worthy of mention <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBridesmill_4b81.html" title="User:Bridesmill">Bridesmill</a> 21:29, 3 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>your sick why dont you just wash your butt and anus after every time you goto the bathroom for a poop. besides why would some one want to be more of a whity any way. Dirty White Folks come up with the weirdest stuff. I am one of the pioneers of this subject and actually invented and sell anal bleaching products. So it is real and I would like to discuss with you the best way to update information on this site without being classified as spamming. I wrote the original article on Crappers Quarterly. There is important information on this topic that needs to be understood. Your information on hydroquinone is dangerous. Nobody should use hydroquinone on their anus or genital areas. I think my company information and the other information I posted is very relevant to this topic but I want to conform to the rules of the site.</p>
<p>Please feel free to contact me offline at info@southbeachskinsolutions.com. Thank you.</p>
<p>Bill</p>
<p><br />
Firstly, please sign your post with four tildes (~). I don't undersatnd why you say that my mentioning that hydroquinine is a potential carcinogen is "dangerous", when in the next line you say it shouldn't be used. I don't know what your product contains, but others admit to theirs containing this substance - in fact, I'm not the person who wrote that here, and it is the cited ingredient in two of the external links. You cannot advertise on WP - it is an encyclopedia, not a yellow pages. Plus the content you feel is 'important' is nothing but advertising copy and not verifiable (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>) - if you're the person who invented this stuff, it's also original research (<a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> which is also not allowed here. In terms of 'important info' - I didn't see any here or in the 'article', which reads more like an ad. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBridesmill_4b81.html" title="User:Bridesmill">Bridesmill</a> 16:27, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thank you for your comments and suggestions. First, sorry for any form mistakes. I am a newbie. That said, I would like to contribute the information I have gathered on this topic over the past year of dedicating my life to it in an appropriate manner. So many people (men and women both) are looking for good information on this topic. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this with you and your willingness to sift through it and help decide what is valuable to the readers. I can appreciate how difficult that might be.</p>
<p>I want people to know that anal and vaginal lightening is real. That seems to be one of the biggest issues. People think it is an urban myth. It is not. My original research and article (upon which many other prominent articles have been based) is the first that brought this topic to light as a real treatment being performed by a few salons around the world. I hoped my information on the origins of the treatment and causes of the dark discoloration of the anal and genital area would be valuable information.</p>
<p>Next, the issue of hydroquinone is an important one (as you know) as it is commonly found in general skin lightening products. These products are inappropriate for use on the anus and genitals because of the potential problems that they can cause. Namely irritation and other long term side effects. Many people resort to using these general lightening products because, until now, no appropriate product has existed on the marketplace. Your reference to hydroquinone seemed to imply that this ingredient is what should be used for anal bleaching. Our product has been specifically formulated for use in these sensitive areas and is all natural. It does not contain any hydroquinone or kojic acid and utilizes a unique technique to achieve results unlike general lightening products that simply bleach the top layer of skin using harsh chemicals.</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience and consideration. While I do want people to know about my products, I am passionate about this topic and want people to get good information.</p>
