<p>What's the source for saying Ana-Lucia is (was) a police officer? It certainly fits, but I haven't heard that on screen yet.

<p>I'm pretty sure Ana-Lucia is dead. She loses muscle control after being shot, and in the previews for the next episode (which overlay words such as "tragedy,") she is seen lying on the floor as people proclaim that she is dead.

<dd>The "she is dead" seemed to me to be deliberately ambiguous, as though it could refer to either Ana-Lucia or Libby. I figure the producers are hoping we'll think it was Ana-Lucia and then be surprised if it is Libby, or that people will second guess like I'm doing. *shrugs* &#160;;-) <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Wolff_04d2.html" title="User:Black Wolff">Black Wolff</a> 02:08, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm hoping it's Ana-Lucia. Although I don't like her character, I'd rather her be dead than Libby. Killing someone's significant other already happened with Shannon, I don't think the Lost writers would do it again, but then again, they're all about surprise. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorhange_6c2c.html" title="User:Morhange">Morhange</a> 16:15, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Michelle Rodrigues involvement with the show is likely not over. She was stopped for a DUI in Hawaii on May 6, 2006. Her character's death occured in the episode "Two for the Road" which aired May 3, 2006. One-hour TV shows are usually shot 4-6 weeks before they are broadcast. If she was indeed let go from the show, there would be no reason for Rodriguez to remain in Hawaii as her death scenes were filmed months before.</dd>

<p>Coincidentally, Cynthia Watros, who plays Libby who was also fatally shot in the same episode was also arrested for DUI on the same night.</p>

<dd>The character's name is obviously Spanish, and accent marks are used in Spanish to denote emphasis on a syllable. However, the default is that the second to last syllable in a word is emphasized. References from ABC aside, it would make no sense at all to put an accent above that letter. 24.20.131.214 03:10, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just for clarification, Spanish accent rules indicate that diphthongs are broken if the 'weak' vowel (i,u) is the stressed one and the 'strong' vowel (a, e, o) is not. In this case, the 'weak' vowel MUST be always accented, regardless of its position in the word.

<dd>I haven't looked at all of them yet, but most of them are way to "clean" looking for starters. We're using fair use images of characters that do not look significantly different from the actors who play the, a situation that usually leads to no images on the character articles. Wikipedia has pretty strict policy (<a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">WP:FU</a>) about using pictures of living people. Personally, <i>I</i> don't care. Remember all those nice screen shots we had on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Lost_episodes_f69f.html" title="List of Lost episodes">List of Lost episodes</a>? I argued in great detail for us to use those images. We now don't have any images on that list, and we were unable to show that the images were vital to the article. We're facing a similar situation here, and if we want to use images, <i>any</i> fair use images, we need strong fair use rationales. Some editors want to remove these images completely from the character articles. If we show that we're at least using an image that illustrates something <i>about</i> the character, or even just showing the character "in action", or doing something typical for that character, we would then have a leg to stand on. If we can't even do that, then we risk losing these images all together.</dd>

<dd>Everyone else wants to use the promotional photos of the characters for the character boxes. It's the image ABC used to promote the character, so it is representive enough to work.</dd>
<dd>The purpose of the image is only to illustrate the character in question. Images showing events from that character's history can be used later in the article. --<a href="../../../d/r/b/User%7EDrBat_c7e7.html" title="User:DrBat">DrBat</a> 04:01, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The argument here is that the image <i>isn't</i> of the <i>character</i>. She's not even wearing clothes we see in the show. This is a clean image of an actor with an island background, and nothing more to connect the two. We need to represent the character more to make a stronger fair use argument. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 04:26, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You said something similar to what happened at List of Lost episodes is happening here with the characters, but didn't you start this? You appear to be the only arguing the other side of this argument. And I have an issue with Kate's image. I hated it when we lost our images in the episode list, and this is too much. Leave it alone. These images were taken for the TV show. We didn't randomly grab a picture of Michelle Rodriguez; we took one from the ABC website. You also say that these don't depict the character, but the character never posed for a camera, and what about the <a href="../../../s/e/a/Image%7ESeasonthree2.jpg_1082.html" title="Image:Seasonthree2.jpg">Image:Seasonthree2.jpg</a>? The characters don't all wear those clothes, and Juliet has never been that close to Desmond. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThedemonhog_09cd.html" title="User:Thedemonhog">theDemonHog</a> 05:59, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Some of the images I can understand, but come on man, that image is <i>horrible</i> for Ana Lucia. Ana is a tough and rumble character, full of fire. Image:Anamich.jpg is actually <i>misleading</i> in the image it creates for the character. It's hardly connected to Ana Lucia at all, which is why I've taken such notice on <i>this</i> picture over the others. Seriously, why is there such objection here?

<dd>And for <a href="../../../s/e/a/Image%7ESeasonthree2.jpg_1082.html" title="Image:Seasonthree2.jpg">Image:Seasonthree2.jpg</a>, I'd say the fact that these people show up in the same image help make it different from images of the people themselves. It's notable because it includes a <i>group</i> of characters, and it's hard (if not impossible) to find an image of all the characters like this in any other form. It's a cast shot, and has it's own elements that are different from an image being used to illustrate a single character. For this article, it's not hard at all to find a better image. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 06:15, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>For the full cast images, you could just use more than one image. It is not required for them to be all in the same frame, and it would be "more in-character." And I still think you are the only one who has a problem with Image:Anamich.jpg --154.20.217.225 00:13, 29 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>We try to limit the number of fair use images being used, so if we can use a single image for a group of people then that would be more desirable. I'm only pointing out that the image needs to be replaced in order to have a stronger fair use rational. If I'm the only one who wants to comply with policy doesn't mean we don't do that.

<p>This was kinda discussed in the Featured Article review for Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the issue of promo photos from the network. Although I did not see it exactly resolved, editors were debating over the distinction of whether the image was released as a presskit (that the network was passing out for people to use to promote the show) or whether it was taken off the network website (which was the network's pictures with prohibitions against using them), and if that made any difference for our purposes. I found some of the pics being used for the characters on the ABC website, and there was a link from the ABC page restricting use of pictures it uses. I don't know where the promo pics came from, the website or a promo kit, and don't know if it matters. . . Is this relevant at all to this discussion? I don't think concensus was ever really reached on the Buffy FA discussion page, but I thought it might be worth mentioning in case it was relevant. <a href="../../../r/i/v/User%7ERiverbend_1f41.html" title="User:Riverbend">Riverbend</a> 16:15, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>INMO screenshopts are the best way to represent a character - the promo pics are beautiful, but not really character-realistic as Ned has explained . . I think that it would be safer to just find decent screenshots for the character, but not change an individual pic until we have a good individual one to replace it (why change from something problematic to something problematic in another way, and then have to debate which is worse) . . . My main concern is that finding a pic that "represents" a character can create more controversy, because then people might start switching screen shots back and forth because one isn't as representative as the other, and the edit war will resume. Ned, do you think this would be a problem, or if folx agree that if we have a fair use individual screenshot (particularly based on the "character representation" position) that it would be left alone? <a href="../../../r/i/v/User%7ERiverbend_1f41.html" title="User:Riverbend">Riverbend</a> 16:31, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I agree with Riverbend. Find a good screenshot with Ana as the main focus, and use that instead. The promo image doesn't represent the character very well, and the other image is too crowded. If I remember correctly, I think there was a good closeup of her reaction right after she realizes she shot Shannon. Ideally, I'd love to see that image here, as I think it represents the character and a major plot point revolving around her, a very important point in her life on the island. Unfortunately, I don't have the episode recorded, or the DVD, or I'd try to find that screenshot myself. Anybody else have the DVDs that can get that? --<a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaelwys_a686.html" title="User:Maelwys">Maelwys</a> 16:29, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The fact that it's rainy and she's not posing for the camera is exactly the point... it's a better image of the CHARACTER when it's from the actual show, when she's reacting to things around her (like the shock of realizing she just killed somebody) and the environment of the show (the rain that always seems to be falling when bad things happen). It captures the character a lot better this way, instead of a posed image of the actress interacting directly with the camera, which is more appropriate on the actresses own bio page, and not on the page of the character. --<a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaelwys_a686.html" title="User:Maelwys">Maelwys</a> 15:42, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Because screenshots show the characters, promo's show the actors posing for the camera. If every picture tells a story (or is worth 1000 words, or whatever) I'd much rather see an image that tells the characters story than a promo shot that says "I got paid a lot of money to have pictures taken of me advertising the new season, go me!" --<a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaelwys_a686.html" title="User:Maelwys">Maelwys</a> 15:42, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Agree per Ned Scott and Maelwys - the promo pictures are both really nice, and the second is probably better than the first, but INMO the screenshots - particularly the one proposed - really give a better picture of the character. However, I am wondering about the promo pictures on all the character pages - if we decide that screenshots would be better here, should we be looking for screenshots for the other characters as well, or just for the Ana page? <a href="../../../r/i/v/User%7ERiverbend_1f41.html" title="User:Riverbend">Riverbend</a> 16:46, 1 December 2006 (UTC)
