<h2><span class="mw-headline">Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism</span></h2>
<p>The article states:</p>
<p>Many anarchists strongly argue that anarcho-capitalism is not a form of anarchism, since they believe capitalism to be inherently authoritarian. For example, individualist anarchists <b>Kevin Carson</b> and Ken Knudson argue that capitalism cannot occur without state power being used to back the expropriation of surplus value from the laborer. (emphasis added)</p>
<p>However, the article <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Carson_3c69.html" title="Kevin Carson">Kevin Carson</a> states:</p>
<p>Carson has written sympathetically about several <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalists</a>, arguing that they use the word "capitalism" in a different sense than he does and that they represent a legitimate strain of anarchism.</p>
<p>--85.25.111.108 17:20, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Right. There is no contradiction there. Carson defines capitalism like this: "As a mutualist anarchist, I believe that expropriation of surplus value--i.e., capitalism--cannot occur without state coercion to maintain the privilege of usurer, landlord, and capitalist." Anarcho-capitalists are also opposed to state coercion. Anarcho-capitalists define capitalism as voluntary trade. They both advocate market economies, but Carson thinks there would be no profit because he is still holding on to the labor theory of value. Anarcho-capitalists think there would still be profit and that Carson is a terrible economist. <a href="../../../d/t/c/User%7EDTC_5378.html" title="User:DTC">DTC</a> 17:46, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Why is this Carson Critique included when the title is about the debate as to whether ANCAP is a form of anarchism? As pointed out above, Carson believes that ANCAP is a legitimate form of anarchism. 86.133.126.162 00:16, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree. I guess it should be removed. Carson doesn't claim that anarcho-capitalism is not a form of anarchism. <a href="../../../d/t/c/User%7EDTC_5378.html" title="User:DTC">DTC</a> 05:05, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Looking at that section "Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism" that section should probably be removed. It doesn't really make sense. If it's a criticism of anarchism capitalism arguing that it's not a form of anarchism then it should be in the "Criticisms of anarcho-capitalism" section. Don't you think? <a href="../../../d/t/c/User%7EDTC_5378.html" title="User:DTC">DTC</a> 05:12, 4 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think it should stay. Question whether anarcho-capitalism is a form of anarchism is quite important for some people and deserves its own section. <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVision_Thing_6e8a.html" title="User:Vision Thing">-- Vision Thing --</a> 16:48, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>How about calling the section "Claims that anarcho-capitalism is not a form of anarchism" then? "Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism" is very vague. <a href="../../../d/t/c/User%7EDTC_5378.html" title="User:DTC">DTC</a> 17:32, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey I just removed a source from this article. It said that Barbara Goodwin says in her book "Using Political Ideas" that anarcho-capitalism is not a type of anarchism. Luckily, I just happen to have this book and that is not what it says. I quote here:"Although many anarchists today still subscribe to the values of Bakunin and Kropotkin, there are two new, divergent currents of anarchist thinking. One is anarcho-capitalism, a form of libertarian anarchism which demands that the state should be abolished and that private individuals and firms should control social and economic affairs....." That is on page 137 in my 1987 edition. Maybe the rest of the sources should be checked up on.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 20:59, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Disambiguate</span></h2>
<p>I was looking for a wikipage on Ancap, Uruguay's state-owned petroleum company, and I ended up here. Beats me, never had really heard of ancap to describe anarcho-capitalism. Anyway, I think we should take some steps aiming at disambiguating this issue.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">POV</span></h2>
<p>The last paragraph of the lead ignores the controversy surrounding anarcho-capitalism's classification as anarchist (not all definitions demonstrate that ancap is anarchist). It also tries to devalue anarchists' opposition to anarcho-capitalism, saying that it's merely because of a "sectarian bias", instead of explaining why they actually oppose it. It also cites Wikipedia, which is unacceptable. Overall, the lead sounds very tendentious, and it could be indicative of the bias throughout the rest of the article (I'll do a more thorough analysis later). A Featured Article Review is surely in order. -- <a href="../../../w/g/e/User%7EWGee_01b0.html" title="User:WGee">WGee</a> 03:48, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's easy to fix. Just take out the claim that the reason is because of sectarian bias.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 03:51, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Done. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 05:49, 26 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>My concerns have not been properly addressed. The last paragraph still says that anarcho-capitalism is a form of anarchism "by definition"—but by who's definition? And, you can't ignore the view of those publications that do not regard anarcho-capitalism as a form of anarchism. The former lead properly addressed the controversy in a neutral and effective way. So until that former lead is restored, I will continue to dispute the article's neutrality. There are also some other parts of the article whose neutrality I question. In the future, please don't hastily remove the POV tag without first consulting the one who raised the complaint. -- <a href="../../../w/g/e/User%7EWGee_01b0.html" title="User:WGee">WGee</a> 23:31, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For some reason there is a section entitled "Sources which consider Anarcho-capitalism a form of anarchism". However, the purpose of this article is not to demonsrate that anarcho-capitalism is a form of anarchism: it's not an essay. More importantly, though, the "Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism" section has been deleted—another attempt to hide the viewpoints of non-anarcho-capitalists. -- <a href="../../../w/g/e/User%7EWGee_01b0.html" title="User:WGee">WGee</a> 23:36, 26 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If it's claimed that anarcho-capitalism is commonly considered a form of anarchism then it needs sources. One or two sources isn't going to back up a claim like that. Since the anti-capitalists try to take out claims that anarcho-capitalism is a form of anarchism, then those sources are necessary. They try to push their minority viewpoint on the article. <a href="../../../d/t/c/User%7EDTC_5378.html" title="User:DTC">DTC</a> 23:51, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Moreover, the lead states that "It is considered a type of individualist anarchism." Yet there are many people (anti-capitalists in particular) who deny this statement. (By the way, in a Featured Article, <a href="../../../a/w/w/WP%7EAWW_3219.html" title="WP:AWW">weasel words should not be used</a>). -- <a href="../../../w/g/e/User%7EWGee_01b0.html" title="User:WGee">WGee</a> 23:48, 26 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's true that it's considered a type of individualist anarchism. THat's the view of scholars. The sources are at the bottom of the article but you want to remove them. Of course some anarcho-communists are going to say it's not real anarchism, because they're communists. <a href="../../../d/t/c/User%7EDTC_5378.html" title="User:DTC">DTC</a> 23:51, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Indeed, there are plenty of sources at the bottom that seem to support the claim. I thusly removed the NPOV tag, since no sources are presented by you claiming otherwise. Intangible 23:56, 26 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It is necessary to say who, exactly, made the statement, and then to provide sources. I have no problem with you saying that "so-and-so says that anarcho-capitalism is a form of individualist anarchism." But you cannot use weasel words to suggest that the whole world believes that anarcho-capitalism is a form of anarchism. And if you refuse to rectify this problem and others in thier entirety, this article will have to be stripped of its FA status. -- <a href="../../../w/g/e/User%7EWGee_01b0.html" title="User:WGee">WGee</a> 23:58, 26 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>What do you mean? The sources are right there. Those sources at bottom section of the article all say anarcho-capitalism is anarchism. <a href="../../../d/t/c/User%7EDTC_5378.html" title="User:DTC">DTC</a> 00:02, 27 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Did you even bother to read my last few posts? I don't care how many sources you procure: that fact remains that anti-capitalists do not believe that anarcho-capitalism is a form of anarchism, and that viewpoint is being hidden. Also, why did either you or Intangible insert a contraction into the lead? FAs are supposed to have "brilliant prose", not to mention that encyclopedic articles must never use contractions. -- <a href="../../../w/g/e/User%7EWGee_01b0.html" title="User:WGee">WGee</a> 00:07, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree. Although I appreciate your good intentions, I feel that the article has degraded in quality since I last worked on it.

<p>I've made the changes that I feel are necessary to effect neutrality: the restoration of the former, neutral lead (more or less); the restoration of the <i>Anarcho-capitalism and anarchism</i> section, which is an important section highlighting the ancap vs. anarchism controversy; the deletion of the contentious and biased <i>Sources which consider Anarcho-capitalism a form of anarchism</i> section. <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVision_Thing_6e8a.html" title="User:Vision Thing">Vision Thing</a> also helped to remove some instances of original research. -- <a href="../../../w/g/e/User%7EWGee_01b0.html" title="User:WGee">WGee</a> 00:24, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I say that these sources are unnecessary because the purpose of this article is not to discuss whether or not anarcho-capitalism is a form of anarchism; that is not an important theme. I say that it violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> because it argues that anarcho-capitalism is a form of anarchism while excluding the opposing view.

<dd>I am deleting information out of that section for good reason. It's bad information. It's false. For example it gives a source of Barbara Goodwin as saying anarcho-capitalism is not a form of anarchism but she doesn't say that. She says it is a form of anarchism. That whole little section there is pretty nonsensical.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 17:04, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's not only Barbara Goodwin who interjects her opinion, but several other people, as well. You cannot delete all the other sources because you disagree with this one.

<dd>That shouldnt have its own section anyway, because it's a criticism of anarcho-capitalism, so why not just delete that section and say what needs to be said in the Criticism section?<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 17:14, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Why are you reverting it back? It's full of false information. Look at what Goodwin actually says: ""Although many anarchists today still subscribe to the values of Bakunin and Kropotkin, there are two new, divergent currents of anarchist thinking. One is anarcho-capitalism, a form of libertarian anarchism which demands that the state should be abolished and that private individuals and firms should control social and economic affairs."

<dl>
<dd>Then remove that specific source, or re-word it. Don't delete the whole section and dramatically alter the lead to say that anarcho-capitalism is a form of anarchism. That's a highly contentious claim, not a fact; and in order to comply with NPOV policy, the opposing views must be included in a neutral manner. The way it's set up now is fine: several scholars classify ancap as a form of anarchism, but anti-capitalist anarchists believe that capitalism is authoritarian and thus incompatible with anarchism. Don't try to hide the viewpoint of anarchists, which is well documented. -- <a href="../../../w/g/e/User%7EWGee_01b0.html" title="User:WGee">WGee</a> 17:42, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't care whether it's "featured" or not. I care about whether it's correct or not. You're putting bad information into the article. That section is nonsense. It serves no purpose and it distorts what the source are saying. If someone is going to claim anarcho-capitalism is a form of anarchism then it needs sources.

<dd>Why would this sentence not belong in the Criticism section: "Many anarchists strongly argue that anarcho-capitalism is not a form of anarchism, since they believe capitalism to be inherently authoritarian."

<dd>This has been my belief all along. The "Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism" section is POV and it directs the reader to a POV fork.

<dd>The section is also <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, synthesizing the idea that "anarcho-capitalism is not anarchism" based on statement "capitalism cannot occur without state power being used to back the expropriation of surplus value from the laborer."

<dd>And it sources <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Carson_3c69.html" title="Kevin Carson">Kevin Carson</a>. Carson defines capitalism as "It is state intervention that distinguishes capitalism from the free market." He's talking about capitalism, not anarcho-capitalism.

<dd>Actually I would be a little bit conservative to just linking to website. I've not looked into Kevin Carson, but unless he has previously published on anarchism in scholarly journals etc., it is best to avoid the use of these kind of sources. Intangible 18:30, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also it had Chomsky as a source that it is not anarchism, but Chomsky in "Chomsky on Anarchism" says it is "a strain of anarchism."

<p>Why are the alternate names for anarcho-capitalism being deleted? The reader needs to know straight out that he's looking at the right article. "Anarcho-capitalism" is just one term for the philosophy. In fact, for quite awhile I only knew it as "free market anarchism." "Anarcho-capitalism" is a term which only lately has started getting popular.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 18:38, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Well then something in the first sentence needs to be pointed to that box, because not everybody knows it as "anarcho-capitalism." I think at least "free market anarchism" needs to be mentioned because that it a very popular name for it. Antistate.com which is an anarcho-capitalist site doesn't call it anarcho-capitalism, but "market anarchism."<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 22:19, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"Market anarchism" is too vague a name because markets can exist outside of capitalism.

<dl>
<dd>That's not the point. The point is that it is a synonym. When anyone talks of "free market anarchism" they're talking about what is otherwise known as anarcho-capitalism.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 22:27, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>And "individualist anarchism" is the same way. Most people who call themselves individualist anarchists are what you would call anarcho-capitalists.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 22:31, 1 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps so, but this is where the ancap/anarchism controversy comes into play: most anarchists reject any conflation of anarchism and capitalism. As I've said before, this controversy needs to be documented in detail, and it was documented in the <i>Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism</i> section, until you deleted it. -- <a href="../../../w/g/e/User%7EWGee_01b0.html" title="User:WGee">WGee</a> 22:35, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Despite what you said in your edit summary, several of the sources that you deleted do argue that anarcho-capitalism is not a form of anarchism. All of the sources that I have restored in my last edit either say explictly that anarcho-capitalism is not a form of anarchism or they say that anarcho-capitalism (or capitalism itself) is authoritarian and, therefore, not anarchist. Also, please note that the section is not only devoted to the labelling controversy, but also to describing the differences between anarcho-capitalism and traditional anarchist thought. -- <a href="../../../w/g/e/User%7EWGee_01b0.html" title="User:WGee">WGee</a> 23:12, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There is a difference between capitalism and anarcho-capitalism. A criticism of capitalism is not necessarily a criticism of anarcho-capitalism.

<p>I could make an equally persuasive argument how other forms of anachism are not real anarchism, either. One's rational debates do not necessarily belong in an encyclopedia.

<p>WGee, your premise that anarchism is inherently anti-authoritarian is false. See the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">Anarchism</a> article. Intangible 15:26, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The big problem is pleasing any anarchist with a definition of a concept that defines anarchy or any of its sub-philosophies. This is because any anarchist worth their salt would disagree with any attempt to define the subject, as to define it would place a concept inside the confines of a set border. It is best if the definition fits the broad philosophical and political definition as established by works on those subjects and is judged on those merits alone. <a href="../../../h/o/t/User%7EHotspur23_6190.html" title="User:Hotspur23">Hotspur23</a> 19:15, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">External links - why removal?</span></h2>
<p>Hi, I am hoping it was just a misunderstanding, but I have to ask to make sure:</p>
<p>There were a couple of recent additions to the "External links" that were even more recently removed. They weren't seen as POV issues (they are external links after all) but apparently it was because they were presumed to be not related to anarcho-cap thought.&#160;???</p>
<p>I just re-added them ( <a href="http://www.AdventuresInLegalLand.com" class="external free" title="http://www.AdventuresInLegalLand.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.AdventuresInLegalLand.com</a> and <a href="http://www.TOLFA.us" class="external free" title="http://www.TOLFA.us" rel="nofollow">http://www.TOLFA.us</a> ) because both ARE definitely related -- they are VERY practical anarcho-capitalist resources, especially for those seeking to research/act on more than just abstract/economic theory.</p>
<p>I believe that labels are dangerous, and an easy way to dismiss logical analysis... but to humour the removing person and to clarify their applicability, I have added the anarcho-capitalism label ... However if in the coming days someone still believes they should be removed, please at least FIRST check out both resources for their theme/content and you will surely see that they are very much anarcho-cap promoting.&#160;:) And be decent enough to state (ha ha) in this here discussion page WHY they are re-removed. Please and thank you. 68.149.190.31 02:28, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, the main synonyms for anarcho-capitalism should be listed right up there in the first sentence because it's not referred to as "anarcho-capitalism" by everybody. I don't understand why you're fighting that. And the "Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism" section should be deleted or started from scratch because it doesn't make sense. What is its purpose? If it has one, maybe it should be made more explicit by changing the title. I can't figure out what the theme is supposed to be as being distinct from "Criticims of anarcho-capitalism."<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 01:39, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This article discusses the opposing viewpoints as to whether or not anarcho-capitalism is a form of anarchism. It also compares and contrasts traditional anarchism and this new anarcho-capitalism. There is enough information and controversy about these two issues to merit a separate article. What's in this article isn't criticism, but rather an important description of profound ideological differences.</dd>

<dd>I'm opposed to including multiple names in the lead partly because I don't want to overwhelm the reader with anarcho-capitalist jargon early-on. Also, most articles at Wikipedia (and encyclopedic articles in general) only state the most popular name in the first sentence—which, to my knowledge, is anarcho-capitalism. You needn't be so worried, anyway; most readers will grasp the subject of the article after reading the lead, and I doubt that they'll completely miss the box of ancap terms.</dd>

<dd>The "Anarchism and Anarcho-Capitalism" is not POV because so far there is insufficient evidence that anarchism and "an"-cap are the same thing. We're waiting for self-proclaimed "an"-caps to prove that capitalism can be anarchistic. Simply claiming to be a form of "anarchism" does not make one an anarchist more than standing in a garage makes one a Lexus. So far "an"-caps have simply applied the prefix to themselves simply because they are opposed to the public State. They haven't shown any similiarities with any other school of Anarchism (not even Individualist Anarchism) in any other area. <a href="../../../f/u/l/User%7EFull_Shunyata_bffa.html" title="User:Full Shunyata">Full Shunyata</a> 13:55, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your premise that to be a form of anarchism you have to have similarities with others forms of anarchism. That's just not true. I pride my philosophy on being different than all the other anarchist philosophies. I don't have to prove that anarcho-capitalism is anarchism. The article already contains sources from a wide variety of scholars (non-anarcho-capitalists) that say it is.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 16:28, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes. Even if I was wrong that anarcho-capitalism was a form of anarchism, but title is not neutral and Wikipedia is supposed to be neutral.

I just greatly improved the article by sourcing statements that were unsourced, and adding better explanations of things. Then you come along and revert everything. I'm sorry, but that just won't do. If you have a problem with any of my edits, then discuss them here one at a time. So far, you haven't pointed out anything that you believe were bad edits. You apparently just don't like the idea that I edited the article, so you reverted all my edits.

<dd>It doesnt seem those edits were POV. For example, Colin Ward is an anarchist of the socialist kind, who is not a neutral observer. What Joe Peacott and individualist anarchists think about capitalism should be written about in <a href="../../../i/n/d/Individualist_anarchism.html" title="Individualist anarchism">individualist anarchism</a>, not in <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalism</a>.

<li>6 I removed that because it says that it is controversial that anarcho-capitalism was influenced by 19th century individualist anarchists. That's not controversial at all. It's well known that Rothbard studied Tucker and Spooner. I put a source there just to be sure, and I have more sources if anyone needs them.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 23:02, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>7 I moved that out of there to another section because it's already stated in that section that the 19th century individualists anarchists thought that competition in a free market would make it impossible to profit.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 23:04, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>8 I deleted what I moved to that section in the step above, because this section is not for that kind of information. Again, it's already talked about that the 19th century individualists thought profit couldn't happen, so it's just redundant.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 23:06, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>9 It's true that profit is not defined in mainstream economics as individuals receiving less pay than the labor theory of value says that they should receive. That's not there anymore anyway.

<dd>Actually, I obviously have read the talk page, and I obviously made those comments with the content of the talk page in mind. You listed what you thought were POV edits. You didn't give a <i>reason</i> they were POV. And I don't see how they were major enough to justify discussing before editing. Plus, the little quote you dug out on the false suspicion it helped justify your position is irrelevant: the fact that he has to defend the change doesn't mean he has to post on the talk page before making it. That's not how Wikipedia works. <a href="../../../m/r/v/User%7EMrVoluntarist_23fd.html" title="User:MrVoluntarist">MrVoluntarist</a> 18:48, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your first complaint was that I edited the article without getting your permission. None of us need to get your permission before editing the article. Who do you think you are? I don't need to discuss my edits in advance. It's perfectly legal to discuss them afterwards if anyone happens to question them. After pressing you to explain if you had any complaints about the edits themselves, instead of just being upset that I edited the article without your prior permission, you came up with a few complaints about some specific edits. I explained the reasons for them, and you haven't explained any disagreement with those reasons. You claim here that I won't "compromise." Compromise what exactly? I'm here asking what you think is wrong with my edits, so that if you're right then they can be fixed. You don't seem to be willing to engage in any real discussion of the issues. But, then you go complaining to adminstrators that I won't discuss my edits which is not true. The reverse is true. You don't want to discuss your deletions and my edits. Here I am, and here I've been waiting to discuss, but you won't do it. Instead of discussing the issues, you stick a NPOV tag on the article. You put a "cleanup" tag on the article, but then why I "clean up" you revert that as well. Either you want the article "cleaned up" or you don't. Which is it?

<dd>Sorry, but it seems that those sources where from highly partisan writers. There are enough credible neutral sources saying that individual anarchist are in favor of free markets. Somehow Ward takes the marginal view that somehow this not the case. The only POV comes from Ward being used as reference here, for saying individualist anarchists don't believe in free markets.

<dl>
<dd>I responded to his objections but he hasn't responded back. As he said above, he refuses to. He'd rather just put a POV banner on the article. Again, the reason I removed the Ward source is because there was no page number to verify it. I have the book and I don't see him saying anywhere that capitalism isn't a free market. Why would he?

<dd>But do you have a source, anarcho-capitalism, saying that individualist anarchists did not "mistrust capitalism"? If so, that would still not be a legitimate reason to delete the source; you should merely juxtapose the two. Moreover, that there is no page number does not make the reference invalid or nonexistent. The proper solution, rather than deletion, would be to ask the editor who originally inserted the reference to reveal the page number. -- <a href="../../../w/g/e/User%7EWGee_01b0.html" title="User:WGee">WGee</a> 05:59, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What does "mistrust capitalism" mean? I don't know what it means, and I doubt anyone else does either. All in all it was a meaningless sentence. Again, I have that book and there are only a few pages devoted to anarcho-capitalistm, what that sentence said is just not in there. As I said, it's already explained what the difference is between 19th century form and the anarcho-capitalist form of individualist anarchism. I actually rewrote much of that section in order to clarify what the difference is. You know, I find it really strange that you're condemning me from removing a sentence that was incoherent and was not sourced properly, but then you deleted my well-cited edits in your massive reversion. So, let me ask you, why did you delete, for example, this sentence: "The "normative core" of classical liberalism is the idea that in an environment of laissez-faire, a spontaneous order of cooperation in exchanging goods and services emerges that satisfies human wants." (Razeen, Sally. Classical Liberalism and International Economic Order: Studies in Theory and Intellectual History, Routledge (UK) <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-415-16493-1</a>, 1998, p. 17)??? Any other reason besides I didn't get your permission first to put it in the article? <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 16:33, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm unlocking this page, as five days on full protection is simply not warranted (and besides, the irony of locking down an anarchy page.... but I digress). You can arbitrate the issue, but in the interim, I'm going to make a stab at moderating this. Discuss all significant changes here on the talk page, rather than edit-warring. All additions of new substantive content need sources, of course.

<dd>Thanks for offering to moderate this dispute, but I'm going to have to take a break from this article for a while. I'm very busy in real life and don't have time to become entrenched in such lengthy disputes; plus, I believe I can be more productive elsewhere, where I don't have to deal with disruptive editors. I'll check back once in a while, though, to make sure that the POV tag is still there and to monitor the article's progress.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What triggered the protection (the straw that broke the camel's back) was Anarcho-capitalism' persistent removal of the POV tag. It is nobody's prerogative but mine to say whether or not I dispute the article's neutrality. All that is required in good faith is that I justifiy my reasons for disputing that article's neutrality, as I did. My reasons do not have to meet two editors' definitions of "good" or "legitimate" in order for the tag to remain. As I've said, I'll monitor the article's progress intermittently to see if the POV problems have been corrected, but, in the meantime, the tag should remain as a warning to newcomers.</dd>

<dd>Actually, disagreeing with the neutrality of an article is actually <b>not</b> sufficient for maintaining an NPOV tag on the page. Actively discussing disagreement is necessary, but not sufficient, for keeping the banner on the page. You need to make a good-faith attempt at reach consensus on this article. If you cannot or will not engage in discussion, and no one else disputes the neutrality of the article, the article is no longer disputed, and the tag ought come down. There must be discussion, give and take, etc., on ways to move the article to neutrality — positive forward motion, and if you're not here, there can't be any! <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorj</a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_Esperanza_93c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">m</a> <a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">Talk</a> 05:01, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You've got the wrong person. I might have removed the POV banner in a revert inadvertantly when you reverted a large number of edits to the article, but other than I didn't remove the POV banner. I was trying to discuss any problems you had with the article because you put a POV tag there and was content to leave it there while we were discussing, but you weren't able or weren't willing to take the time to discuss. But, JDoorjam is correct above. You can't just stick a POV banner on an article and walk away. If you're the only one that has disputed anything then you need to actually dispute. You need to take the time to discuss any POV issues, so that if they are real, they can be remedied.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 15:38, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a>: market anarchism and anarcho-capitalism are definitely not synonymous. Market anarchism, or free market anarchism, is a much more broadly used term and includes mutualist anarchist thought such as put forward by Proudhon and contemporary Kevin Carson as well as individualist anarchists such as Benjamin Tucker and contemporary Wendy McElroy. Market anarchism is a label encompassing different thought traditions, which have in common their understanding and advocacy of the free market--both as a means for equality, justice, and freedom, and an end (anarchism). I mentioned this point, which I find extremely valid and important, on the talk page for market anarchism as well, but it seems it was disregarded. Per Bylund</dd>
