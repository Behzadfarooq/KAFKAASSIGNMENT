<p>Volcano? I thought that Anakin became Darth Vader when he battled Obi-wan over a pit of acid and got knocked in, thus meaning he needed the suit to survive. Daveryan 18:21 19 May 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've always heard that it was a volcano, though apparently there is no official (canonical) evidence one way or another. Several fan sites claim that a fake prequel (fan fiction, perhaps) script is what started the volcano story. <a href="http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Castle/2042/sw/anakin.html" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Castle/2042/sw/anakin.html" rel="nofollow">One site</a> I found says it was either a volcano or a giant blender. Heh. Then again, as you say, I was able to turn up a few sites that say it was a vat of acid. I really have no idea&#160;:) I will have to ask my wife (big SW fan) to see if she knows whether there is an official version... -- <a href="../../../w/a/p/User%7EWapcaplet_7f49.html" title="User:Wapcaplet">Wapcaplet</a> 18:28 19 May 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Funny thing is, I remember from back when I was young, reading the (non-canonical, I know) comic books that followed from the then-existing movies, there was an issue in which Darth faced off against a cyborg, because such creatures were outlawed in the Empire, or something like that. (It's been twenty years, give me a break.) And to top it off, Vader won by dipping the borg in a lake of acid (that happened to be very lava-coloured in the artwork). Now, you can take that as inconsistency, or as irony, or assume it's being <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retcon.html" title="Retcon">retconned</a>, I suppose. All depends on how you look at it. -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnOwens_79a2.html" title="User:JohnOwens">John Owens</a> 18:44 19 May 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, those comic books are canonical. The cyborg in question was a bounty hunter named Valance. It has not been retconned, and I don't know how anyone could see it as being at all inconsistent.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dd>What I've always heard is a combination of the lava and a duel with Kenobi. I thought it was from the novelization of RotJ (or another of the OT novels).

<dd>It <i>is</i> a pit of lava. Anakin duels his master, and he falls into the pit. Then he's rescued by droids or something of that nature. I saw it in a preview for Episode III when they were shwoing how they remade the mask of Darth Vader.

<dd>no, totally evitable. crazy redirect, really. they could easily have two very differently-tomed articles, both werll-written. It would be less jarring, really; since we never learn much about the transition that takes place in his mind [and hardly can, in the one bridging episode remaining].

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Anakin dies whole</span></h2>
<p>It has been mentioned by me many times before on the Wikipedia site, and I'll say it again...go back and watch the end of "Return Of The Jedi". When Anakin dies, he does not disappear as Yoda and Ben do when they die. Therefore, he dies whole, and is cremated whole, just as Qui-Gon Jinn did in "Phantom Menace". Some Jedi disappear when they die, others do not. Lucas will, at some point, explain all of this. - Hiphats 22:41, 27 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Actually he did. See <a href="http://www.starwars.com/community/askjc/steve/askjc20000131.html" class="external text" title="http://www.starwars.com/community/askjc/steve/askjc20000131.html" rel="nofollow">this page</a> on the offical website.</p>
<p>That page really didn't explain anything at all, it just said pretty much what Hiphats said, "some jedi disappear when they die, others do not." Hopefully this won't be another thing Lucas overlooks in the last movie... -<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShane613_b839.html" title="User:Shane613">shane613</a></p>
<p>It said, towards the end of the fist paragraph; <i>And when Darth Vader sacrifices himself in the end to save his son, he too becomes one with the Force (it is his armor that burned in the Endor funeral pyre).</i> Since this is from the offical website, then Anakin must not have disappeared.</p>

<p>They should not be considered the same person, since their personlaities are so totally different. In Star Wars terms, every fan considers these two different people since one follows the light side of the Force, and the other, the dark side. www.starwars.com/databank has seperate entries for them both, and rightly so.</p>

<p>Jesus christ, this article is a mess. Two days ago the article was merged with <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darth_Vader_35c8.html" title="Darth Vader">Darth Vader</a>, yesterday it was separated and now somebody merged it again.. Can we please cut this crap and talk about it before this becomes a full-grown edit war? <a href="../../../s/w/i/User%7ESwitcher_511d.html" title="User:Switcher">Switcher</a> (talk) 09:15, 1 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>On the official Star Wars website, Anakin Skywalker and Darth Vader are listed as seperate entries. The reason for this is simple: whilst they may be the same person in physical terms, in terms of the personalities and who they truly are, one is a troubled Jedi Knight who clings to the light-side, the other is a full-blown Dark Lord Of The Sith. The pages on Anakin Skywalker and Darth Vader should be made separate.</p>
<p>They are the same person since Anakin becomes Darth Vader in <i>ROTS</i>, i don't see any difference between them because they're not different persons. By the way <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce-o-aces_77c4.html" title="User:Ace-o-aces">Ace-o-aces</a> merged these articles - <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn-1107_e420.html" title="User:John-1107">John V</a>--Ed Telerionus 13:37, 1 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>As the guy who first merged these two I of course feel they are the same person. First of all, just because a character changes his name doesn't make him a differant character. One could argue that his personality so drasticly changes that he is in effect another person. However, there are hints of Vader in the portrail of Anakin in episode I and II, and in ROTJ it's shown that there is still good in Vader. And lastly, having two separate articles causes needless duplication of background information. And now I realize there are separate articles for <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palpatine.html" title="Palpatine">Darth Sidious</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palpatine.html" title="Palpatine">Palpatine</a>...though I think I'll wait untill the movie is released for that merger. -<a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce-o-aces_77c4.html" title="User:Ace-o-aces">Ace-o-aces</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>The new ending for ROTJ on the DVD's shows Hayden Christensen instead of Shaw because Anakin <i>died</i> when he became Darth Vader. Darth Vader killed Anakin, Anakin himself was consumed by evil by turning to the dark side. This is Lucas' vision of it, and we should follow that. <a href="../../../s/w/i/User%7ESwitcher_511d.html" title="User:Switcher">Switcher</a> (talk) 00:30, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The philosophic debate over whether Anakin Skywalker and Darth Vader are the same person is irrelevant. What is relevant is whether Anakin Skywalker and Darth Vader are properly considered two separate encyclopedia subjects, and if so, under which title. As the name Darth Vader is infinitely more notable than the name Anakin Skywalker, any merged article should be at "Darth Vader". I'm moving it there and fixing the article tonight if no one objects. — <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b> <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a></i> 22:57, 5 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>While the name "Darth Vader" is better known, "Anakin Skywalker" is hardly an obscure referance. Also, with the prequel trilogy, the character now spends more time as Anakin then he does as Vader. He's born as Anakin, he dies as Anakin. I don't want to start a editor fight over this though, so lets discuss more before any further switches. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce-o-aces_77c4.html" title="User:Ace-o-aces">Ace-o-aces</a> 16:47, 6 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The name "Darth Vader" is better known. <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28common_names%29_764d.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)</a> says, "Use the most common name of a person or thing that does not conflict with the names of other people or things." "Darth Vader" is the proper location for the article. — <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b> <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a></i> 19:09, 6 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>OK, I'll withdraw my objection to this being under "Darth Vader" <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce-o-aces_77c4.html" title="User:Ace-o-aces">Ace-o-aces</a> 03:46, 7 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>You know what, I think you should had left Anakin Skywalker and Darth Vader in two separate articles. Even if they are the same person, Darth Vader is sorta like an evil persona of Anakin Skywalker. Thus, there should be just two articles. One which is of the good side that is Anakin Skywalker and the other which is the evil side that is Darth Vader. Anyway, you said that Darth Vader is more common but even before he became Darth Vader his original name is still common, especially in the prequels and during the Clone Wars due to his accomplishments when he was a Jedi. Besides that, this article wouldn't be so messed up like now. <a href="../../../j/i/l/User%7EJill_Tan_e057.html" title="User:Jill Tan">Jill Tan</a> 20:32, 11 May 2005</p>
