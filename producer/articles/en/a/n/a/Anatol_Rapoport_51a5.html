<p>Rapoport was born in Lozavaya, <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a>. In 1922, he came to the United States, and in 1928 he became a <a href="../../../n/a/t/Naturalized_citizen.html" title="Naturalized citizen">naturalized citizen</a>. He started studying music in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago.html" title="Chicago">Chicago</a> and continued with <a href="../../../p/i/a/Piano.html" title="Piano">piano</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conducting.html" title="Conducting">conducting</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Composition.html" title="Composition">composition</a> at the <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vienna.html" title="Vienna">Vienna</a> Hochschule fr Musik where he studied from 1929 to 1934. However, due to the rise of <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazism</a>, he found it impossible to make a career as a pianist.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>He shifted his career into <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematics.html" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a>, getting a Ph.D. degree in mathematics under Nicholas Rashevsky at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Chicago_7f0f.html" title="University of Chicago">University of Chicago</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a>. According to the <i>Toronto Globe and Mail</i>, he was a member of the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Communist_Party_015f.html" title="American Communist Party">American Communist Party</a> for three years, but quit before enlisting in the U.S. <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army_Air_Corps_dc92.html" title="Army Air Corps">Army Air Corps</a> in 1941, serving in <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaska.html" title="Alaska">Alaska</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>.</p>
<p>After the war, he joined the Committee on Mathematical Biology at the University of Chicago (<a href="../../../1/9/4/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/5/1954.html" title="1954">1954</a>), where he published his first book, <i>Science and the Goals of Man</i>. He also received a one-year- fellowship at the prestigious Center for Advanced Studies in the Behavioral Sciences (<a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanford.html" title="Stanford">Stanford</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>).</p>
<p>From 1955 to 1970 Rapoport was Professor of Mathematical Biology and Senior Research Mathematician at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Michigan_a8fd.html" title="University of Michigan">University of Michigan</a>, as well as founding member, in 1955, of the Mental Health Research Institute (MHRI) at the University of Michigan.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Anatol_Rapoport_51a5.html" title="Edit section: Game theory">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Game theory</span></h2>
<p>Rapoport had a versatile mind, working in <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematics.html" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a>, <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychology.html" title="Psychology">psychology</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biology.html" title="Biology">biology</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_theory.html" title="Game theory">game theory</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_network.html" title="Social network">social network</a> analysis, and peace and conflict studies (and peacemaking). For example, he pioneered in the modeling of parasitism and <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symbiosis.html" title="Symbiosis">symbiosis</a>, researching <a href="../../../c/y/b/Cybernetics.html" title="Cybernetics">cybernetic theory</a>. This went on to give a conceptual basis for his lifelong work in conflict and cooperation.</p>
<p>He was the author of over 300 articles and of Two-Person Game Theory (1999) and N-Person Game Theory (2001), among many other well-known books on fights, games, violence and peace. He analyzed contests in which there are more than two sets of conflicting interests, such as war, diplomacy, poker or bargaining. His work led him to peace research (see below), including books on <i>The Origins of Violence' (1989) and 'Peace, An Idea Whose Time Has Come</i> (1993), both written at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Toronto_e570.html" title="University of Toronto">University of Toronto</a>.</p>
<p>He won a computer tournament in the 1980s, based on <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Axelrod_8916.html" title="Robert Axelrod">Robert Axelrod</a>'s <i>The Evolution of Cooperation</i>. This sought to understand how cooperation could emerge through evolution. Rapoport's entry, <i>Tit-For-Tat</i> has only four lines of code. The program opens by cooperating with its opponent. It then plays exactly as the other side had played in the previous game. If the other side had defected, the program also defects, but only for one game. If the other side cooperates, the other side continues to cooperate. According to <i>Peace Magazine</i> author/editor Metta Spencer, the program "punished the other player for selfish behaviour and rewarded her for cooperative behaviour -- but the punishment lasted only as long as the selfish behaviour lasted. This proved to be an exceptionally effective sanction, quickly showing the other side the advantages of cooperating. It also set moral philosophers to proposing this as a workable principle to use in real life interactions."</p>
<p>According to the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Globe_and_Mail_4386.html" title="Toronto Globe and Mail">Toronto Globe and Mail</a>, his children report that he was a strong chess player but a bad poker player because he non-verbally revealed the strength of his hands.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Anatol_Rapoport_51a5.html" title="Edit section: Social Network Analysis">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Social Network Analysis</span></h2>
<p>Anatol Rapoport was an early developer of <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_network.html" title="Social network">social network</a> analysis. His original work was that you could measure large networks by profiling traces of flows through them. This enables learning about the speed of the distribution of resources, including <a href="../../../i/n/f/Information.html" title="Information">information</a>, and what speeds or impedes these flows -- such as <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race.html" title="Race">race</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gender.html" title="Gender">gender</a>, socioeconomic status, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proximity.html" title="Proximity">proximity</a> and <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kinship.html" title="Kinship">kinship</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> This work linked social networks to the <a href="../../../d/i/f/Diffusion_of_innovation.html" title="Diffusion of innovation">diffusion of innovation</a>, and by extension, to <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epidemiology.html" title="Epidemiology">epidemiology</a>. Rapoport's empirical work traced the spread of information within a school. It prefigured the study of <a href="../../../s/i/x/Six_Degrees_7316.html" title="Six Degrees">Six Degrees</a> of connectivity, by showing the rapid spread of information in a population to almost all -- but not all -- school members (see references below).</p>

<p>In 1954, Anatol Rapoport founded the Society for General Systems Research, along with the researchers <a href="../../../l/u/d/Ludwig_von_Bertalanffy_a7c9.html" title="Ludwig von Bertalanffy">Ludwig von Bertalanffy</a>, Ralph Gerard, and <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenneth_Boulding_40d3.html" title="Kenneth Boulding">Kenneth Boulding</a>. From 1970 to his death in 2007, he was a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professor.html" title="Professor">Professor</a> (<a href="../../../e/m/e/Emeritus.html" title="Emeritus">emeritus</a> from 1976) of <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychology.html" title="Psychology">Psychology</a> and Mathematics at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Toronto_e570.html" title="University of Toronto">University of Toronto</a>, Canada.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Homer-Dixon_78fb.html" title="Thomas Homer-Dixon">Thomas Homer-Dixon</a> in the <i>Toronto Globe and Mail</i>, Rapoport "became anti-militarist quite soon after the war. [WWII]. The idea of military values became anathema." He was a leading organizer of the first teach-ins against the <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam_War_129f.html" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a> at the University of Michigan, a model that spread rapidly throughout North America. He told a teach-in: "By undertaking the war against <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam.html" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, the United States has undertaken a war against humanity.... This war we shall not win." (<i>Ann Arbor News</i>, April 1967). He said he was an abolitionist, rather than a total pacifist: "I'm for killing the institution of war".</p>
<p>Rapoport moved to <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto.html" title="Toronto">Toronto</a> in 1970 to avoid the war-making ways of the Vietnam-era <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>. He was appointed professor of mathematics and psychology at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Toronto_e570.html" title="University of Toronto">University of Toronto</a>, 1970-1979. He lived in bucolic Wychwood Park overlooking downtown Toronto, a neighbour of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marshall_McLuhan_b107.html" title="Marshall McLuhan">Marshall McLuhan</a>. On his retirement from the University of Toronto, he became director of the Institute of Advanced Studies in <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vienna.html" title="Vienna">Vienna</a> until 1983.</p>
<p>Rapoport returned to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Toronto_e570.html" title="University of Toronto">University of Toronto</a> to become the founding (and unpaid) Professor of <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peace.html" title="Peace">Peace</a> and Conflict Studies programme, working with <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Ignatieff_1e6f.html" title="George Ignatieff">George Ignatieff</a> and Canada's <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_for_Peace_30ea.html" title="Science for Peace">Science for Peace</a> organization. As its sole professor at the start, he used a rigorous, interdisciplinary approach to the study of peace, integrating mathematics, politics, psychology, philosophy, science and sociology. His main concern was to legitimize peace studies as a worthy academic pursuit. The <a href="../../../t/r/u/Trudeau_Centre_for_Peace_and_Conflict_Studies_8a81.html" title="Trudeau Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies">Trudeau Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies</a> continues to flourish at the University of Toronto, under the leadership of <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Homer-Dixon_78fb.html" title="Thomas Homer-Dixon">Thomas Homer-Dixon</a>. When Rapoport began, there was one (unpaid) professor and twelve students. Now, there are three (paid) professors and ninety students.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Rapoport's students report that he was an engaged and inspiring professor who captured their attention, imagination and interest with his wide-ranging knowledge, passion for the subject, good humor, kind and generous spirit, attentiveness to student concerns and animated teaching style. <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1981, Rapoport co-founded the international <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-governmental_organization.html" title="Non-governmental organization">NGO</a> <i><a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_for_Peace_30ea.html" title="Science for Peace">Science for Peace</a></i>, and in 1984 he created the famous <a href="../../../t/i/t/Tit_for_tat.html" title="Tit for tat">tit for tat</a> strategy for the <a href="../../../i/t/e/Iterated_prisoner%27s_dilemma.html" title="Iterated prisoner's dilemma">iterated prisoner's dilemma</a> tournament held by <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Axelrod_8916.html" title="Robert Axelrod">Robert Axelrod</a> that year. He was recognized in the 1980's for his contribution to world peace through nuclear conflict restraint via his game theoretic models of psychological <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conflict_resolution.html" title="Conflict resolution">conflict resolution</a>. He won the Lenz International Peace Research Prize in 1976.</p>
