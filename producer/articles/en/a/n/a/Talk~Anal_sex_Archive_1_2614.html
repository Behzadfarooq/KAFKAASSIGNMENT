<h2><span class="mw-headline">Complaints</span></h2>
<p>I have a couple of complaints about this page, as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd>in this passage "In the same mentality, women were not officially allowed to find pleasure in sex, therefore sex was only served as a sort of marital prostitution; in this sense, under the sole husband's determination, anal sex was a form of contraception too in the case of couples who already had too many babies, since the ignorance about other methods was total. Similar facts were reported up to a very few decades ago, and it is currently impossible to certify whether this mentality has been totally abandoned or has otherwise been substantially modified."</dd>
</dl>
<p>It seems clear to me that a strong opinion is present here. I object to this statement particularly "sex was only served as a sort of marital prostitution" as even in a specific example, I don't see how consummating the act of marriage can be seen as prostitution, even if in some particular it could, it is quite disturbing to label an entire culture as marital prostitutes. Also, I can't see the point of saying "women were not officially allowed to find pleasure in sex", as even if there are laws to this effect (which I doubt) they certainly would not be enforceable, and would thus be irrelevant.</p>
<p>and this statement here "Although both men and women might enjoy anal sex, because of this physical difference, men often have an easier time enjoying anal sex."</p>
<p>This seems to go far beyond the objective, and rather seems to dwell on some subjective personal musing, not something needed in a encyclopedia entry. If there is some evidence supporting this opinion, please feel free to correct me. Sorry if I came on a bit strong, but while I like this entry overall, I can't stand by on a subject so dear to my heart.&#160;;)</p>

<p>As to the added para on lesbians and anal sex: it conflicts with the intro definition: should mention be made of in the intro that anal sex need not involve penile insertion?

It is a piece of historical trivia, rather than something popular currently, so I am not <i>totally</i> suprised about the lack of hits on google.

<p>This article has had a consistant bias against female receptive anal sex, which I have been working on eliminating since I began editing the wikipedia (literally, it was my 1st edit). I request any/all who have anything useful to add on this subject to do so, and to assist me in reducing the tendancy for this article to be used as a mouthpeice for a bias or POV (not that I think it was ever <b>intentionally</b> used that way). <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 07:33, 15 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm surprised you see it that way really. What you see as bias -- as I understand it, the fact that there's more on male than female receptive anal sex -- I see as there not being all that much more to say. Would you care to expand? <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> 13:49, Feb 15, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't think it's bias. It's just a reflection of the simple fact that during female receptive anal sex, men are more likely to orgasm than women. So there's an objective sense in which it's better for the male than for the female. (unsigned comment by 220.253.32.221)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Couldn't the same argument be made about oral sex, or vaginal sex (which many, perhaps most, women are unable to orgasm from alone?) <a href="../../../p/a/k/User%7EPakaran_a4a0.html" title="User:Pakaran">Pak</a><a href="../../../p/a/k/User_talk%7EPakaran_4352.html" title="User talk:Pakaran">aran</a> 21:54, 2 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>In my opinion, vaginal sex is the most typical source of orgasm for women. As for oral sex, it's pretty obvious who is giving pleasure to whom, and when one person has finished receiving, they can start giving in return. I do not understand why there is anything wrong with making the factual statement that in anal sex the male is more likely to orgasm than the woman. A person who does not know anything about sex would not be aware of that, and I do not understand why it has been edited out. Someone please help me to understand.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well - I can object here. During anal sex my wife has several orgasms, while I have only one. So if during several minutes she has 3 or 5 orgasms and I have only one, who is "morelikely to orgasm"?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What happens with you and your wife doesn't really reflect what's average. It doesn't mean anything. The male is more likely to orgasm. Find me some sort of study that says otherwise everett3 Sep. 9 '05 08:23 (GMT)</dd>

<p>I placed this sentance in the pleasure section "The psychological associations involved in anal intercourse can not be emphasized enough, and as with all sexual practices, the mind functions as the primary sexual organ and basis behind the erotic pleasures."</p>
<p><a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">User:Exploding Boy</a> replaced it with this "As with other forms of intercourse, psychological pleasure probably plays a significant role."</p>
<p>Frankly, while I distinctly prefer my own wording, both of them are unsatisfactory, and in fact I think the psychological signifigance of anal sex deserves it's own section in the article. Anyone who likes can comment, write their own sentance, sub-section, or whatever. I'd particularly like to hear from explodingboy as to what he disliked about my sentance, and liked better about his own. I suppose I might eventually have to write the afor mentioned subsection myself if nobody beats me to it&#160;;) <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 13:40, 15 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I wasn't aware that we had to justify all small changes. If you must know I thought the sentence was a little awkward so I tried to make it sound a bit smoother. As I see it I didn't really alter the meaning, though I'm sure there are many who would disagree with your statement that the mind is the "primary sexual organ" (to begin with, physiologically, of course, that's untrue). Be that as it may, if you think there is enough to say about the psychological aspects of anal sex, by all means include a relevant section. I think it may be stretching it a bit to say it warrants an entire section (is there anything similar in other sex-related articles?), but I'll reserve judgement until I see it.

<p>Nope, not unless you've changed your name. I took a glance at the page history, and the stuff I am generally refering to (see my comments at the top of the page) is well before your time on this page (assuming you didn't edit it as an anon). Anyhow, please don't take my objections personally. The goal is to make this an excellent page (perhaps even brilliant prose) rather than anything to do with particular editors. As far as "justifying small changes", you need only do that when someone (as I am doing here) takes issue w them. In this particular case, I am perfectly willing to let the subject digest whilst we we perfect the optimal way to describe the particulars. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 14:06, 15 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That would be handy because I recently heard the opposite was true, that monogomy was rare amongst male homosexuals, thus asisting a rise in AIDS rates. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam</a> <a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESam_Spade_3418.html" title="User talk:Sam Spade"><b>Spade</b></a> 09:05, 1 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well that's a common stereotype but regardless of its veracity monogamy is not the issue. Aside from the fact that not all gay men are into anal sex, gay men are apparently less likely to engage in anal sex during casual encounters for several reasons including: (1) some see anal sex as being the most intimate form of intercourse and they save it for committed relationships, (2) anal sex is high risk for the spread of STDs, and (3) anal sex is just messier and takes longer than oral/mutual masturbation, etc.</p>
<p>By the way, monogamy is not really the issue when it comes to rising rates of HIV infection. The issue is largely to do with unprotected sex. <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> 10:11, Apr 1, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"homosexuals" over "gays and lesbians"</span></h2>
<p>Why is it that you prefer the term "homosexuals" over "gays and lesbians"? As for your question ("preferred by whom?"), please see the relevant pages on Wikipedia, starting with project:sexuality. <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> 08:13, Apr 27, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was being rhetorical w the question, I know of course who prefers that usage. Homosexual is shorter, more precise, and less POV. The term "gay" is quite POV, being supportive of what is thus portrayed to be a happy state of sexuality. Homosexual is neutral and specific, and thus more accurate and NPOV. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam</a> <a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESam_Spade_3418.html" title="User talk:Sam Spade"><b>Spade</b></a> 08:29, 27 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think you're confusing non-neutral point of view with facts. We've had this discussion umpteen times: "homosexual" is neither more precise nor neutral nor specific than other terms, and as to it being shorter, that's totally irrelevant. The word "gay" is neutral in part in that it is preferred by those it describes.</p>
<p>As to your suggestion that homosexuality may not be "a happy state of sexuality," I'm afraid that the evidence is overwhelmingly against you, as has been demonstrated amply before.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.psych.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.psych.org/" rel="nofollow">American Psychiatric Association</a> states that</p>
<pre>
     All major professional mental health organizations have gone on record
     to affirm that homosexuality is not a mental disorder. In 1973 the 
     American Psychiatric Association’s Board of Trustees removed 
     homosexuality from its official diagnostic manual, The Diagnostic and 
     Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Second Edition (DSM II). The 
     action was taken following a review of the scientific literature and 
     consultation with experts in the field. The experts found that 
     homosexuality does not meet the criteria to be considered a mental 
     illness.
</pre>
<p>In 1992, the American Psychiatric Association issued the following statement:</p>
<pre>
     Whereas homosexuality per se implies no impairment in judgement, 
     stability, reliability, or general social or vocational capabilities, 
     the American Psychiatric Association calls on all international health 
     organizations and individual psychiatrists in other countries, to urge 
     the repeal in their own country of legislation that penalized homosexual 
     acts by consenting adults in private. And further the APA calls on these 
     organizations and individuals to do all that is possible to decrease the 
     stigma related to homosexuality wherever and whenever it may occur.
</pre>
<p>According to the APA,</p>
<pre>
     For a mental condition to be considered a psychiatric disorder, it must 
     constitute dysfunction within an individual, cause present distress 
     (e.g., a painful symptom), disability (e.g., impairment in one or more 
     important areas of functioning), or a significantly increased risk of 
     suffering death, pain, disability, or an important loss of freedom. A 
     homosexual or bisexual individual may experience conflict with a
     homophobic society; however, such conflict is not a symptom of 
     dysfunction in the individual.
</pre>
<pre>
     The APA Board recognized that a significant portion of homosexual and 
     bisexual people were clearly satisfied with their sexual orientation and 
     showed no signs of psychopathology. It was also found that they were 
     able to function effectively in society, and that those who sought 
     treatment most often did so for reasons other than sexual orientation.
</pre>
<pre>
     Those who have integrated their sexual orientation into a positive
     sense of themselves function at a healthier psychological level than 
     those who have not (all of the above taken from the APA website).
</pre>

<dd>I am going to avoid comment on the above slights, and rather redirect your attentions to my statement above, wherein I point out the POV nature of the term "gay". This term implies happiness. It is not an impartial term. Heterosexual is also an impartial term. "Stud" would not be. It implies a variety of things other than simply "heterosexual", much of them positive, and clearly few if any of them NPOV. "Gay" is similar in this way.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As to if I think homosexuals are happy or not, my POV isn't technically relevant, but I will humor you. As with all humans, homosexuals are variously happy, but I will tell you very briefly about 2 I have known very well, one happy, and one less so. Both of these gentlemen love and believe in God, and this is the deciding factor in their happiness. One was quite happy, because he believed as I do that it is not for men to judge a mans soul, but rather God who knows our hearts. He was a generally good person, and while as with all people he surely had variations of character, he seemed content in his relationship with God, and his status as a good person. I mention him in the past tense only because I have moved several times since I worked with him in Wisconsin. The other guy is a co-worker of mine right now. He doesn't strike me as very gay at all, altho he is by all accounts homosexual. He is a Pentecostal, from a very strict church. They don't allow members to wear shorts, women to wear makeup, and are generally judgmental. He told me that he feels terrible at church, guilty and ashamed. I told him that I felt his church was excessive in its rigidity, and made a big point of reinforcing to him just what the <b>ONLY</b> unforgivable sin is. Blaspheme of the Holy Spirit. By any account I am aware of (and I have studied religion lifelong with unflinching persistence :) this does not involve homosexuality, gay or otherwise :). Ones relationship with God is the root of true happiness in my eyes, not race, creed, sexuality or other nonessentials.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I pray that was helpful, and I will say in summary that "gay" takes a POV stand, and homosexual does not. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam</a> <a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESam_Spade_3418.html" title="User talk:Sam Spade"><b>Spade</b></a> 03:41, 28 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I interpret neutrality (NPOV) to mean wikipedia may not endorse any one term over others.

<dd>My comments were not intended as slights, but I cannot understand your examples at all.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">simplification</span></h2>
<p>One thing is certain, you are not understanding me. Lets just focus on the matter at hand. Gay is POV. Homosexual is not. One is clinical, used in your APA example, the other isn't. I was never trying to say gay people are sad, I was trying to say that homosexual is a precise, unbiased clinical term, and "gay" isn't. There can be an article on <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay.html" title="Gay">gay</a>, but it is a different article from <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexual.html" title="Homosexual">homosexual</a>. One is appropriate as an encyclopedia adjective, the other isn't. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam</a> <a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESam_Spade_3418.html" title="User talk:Sam Spade"><b>Spade</b></a> 06:39, 28 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Actually the APA says: "Lesbian and gay male are preferred to the word 'homosexual' when used as an adjective referring to specific persons or groups, and lesbians and gay men are preferred terms over 'homosexuals' used as a noun when referring to specific persons or groups. The word 'homosexual' has several problems of designation. First, it may perpetuate negative stereotypes because of its historical associations with pathology and criminal behavior. Second, it is ambiguous in reference because it is often assumed to refer exclusively to men and thus renders lesbians invisible. Third, it is often unclear."</p>
<p>"The terms 'gay male' and 'lesbian' refer primarily to identities and to the modern culture and communities that have developed among people who share those identities. They should be distinguished from sexual behavior. Some men and women have sex with others of their own gender but do not consider themselves to be gay or lesbian. In contrast, the terms 'heterosexual' and 'bisexual' currently are used to describe identity as well as behavior."</p>
<p>"The terms 'gay' as an adjective and 'gay persons' as a noun have been used to refer to both males and females. However, these terms may be ambiguous in reference since readers who are used to the term 'lesbian and gay' may assume that 'gay' refers to men only. Thus it is preferable to use 'gay' or 'gay persons' only when prior reference has specified the gender composition of this term."</p>
<p>"Such terms as 'gay male' are preferable to 'homosexuality' or 'male homosexuality' and so are grammatical reconstructions (e.g., 'his colleagues knew he was gay' rather than 'his colleagues knew about his homosexuality'). The same is true for 'lesbian' over 'female homosexual', 'female homosexuality', or 'lesbianism.'"</p>
<p>"Same-gender behavior, male-male behavior, and female-female behavior are appropriate terms for specific instances of same-gender sexual behavior that people engage in regardless of their sexual orientation (e.g., a married heterosexual man who once had a same-gender sexual encounter). Likewise, it is useful that women and men not be considered 'opposites' (as in 'opposite sex') to avoid polarization, and that heterosexual women and men not be viewed as opposite to lesbians and gay men. Thus, male-female behavior is preferred to the term "opposite sex behavior" in referring to specific instances of other-gender sexual behavior that people engage in regardless of their sexual orientation."</p>
<p>"When referring to sexual behavior that cannot be described as heterosexual, gay, lesbian, or bisexual, special care needs to be taken. Descriptions of sexual behavior among animal species should be termed 'male-male sexual behavior" or 'male-female sexual behavior' rather than 'homosexual behavior' or 'heterosexual behavior,' respectively."</p>

<dd>Actually, you've got it exactly backwards. Homosexual is the biased, non-NPOV term. It is exactly the clinical nature of the term, which was coined to describe what was considered a pathology, that people object to. Not only that, but it's frequently inaccurate as well. And actually, both terms are imprecise. The point of using neutral terminology is that we allow people to call themselves what they want to be called, and we don't use terms that people object to. <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> 08:09, Apr 28, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am no expert, but I would assume it is possible for semen to spill during/after anal intercourse, and thus enter the vagina, especially if the woman is face down. This could more easily happen if the woman engages in further sexual activities after anal intercourse. One could imagine the use of a dildo/vibrator would facilitate this. The instrument if insertion does not matter, if for example a guy fingers a girl after masturbating himself, she may get pregnant. I do not think that semen in the rectum can in any way make a woman pregnant directly.--<a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaxMad_2618.html" title="User:MaxMad">MaxMad</a> 09:56, 23 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<ol>
<li>Images. All featured articles have appropriate and informative pictures. I've heard it rumored that one can find images relating to this topic on the internet, though I wouldn't know, myself.</li>

<p>I would personally be strongly in favor of no pictures at all. You surely mean that all featured articles <i>up to now always had</i> appropriate and informative pictures. Note that having a picture is <i>not</i> a demand for becoming a featured article, and frankly, I think this is a good test case. In particular, a picture of anal intercourse would not add anything, unless you expect people to be unfamiliar with the <a href="../../../a/n/u/Anus.html" title="Anus">anus</a> (in which case, see there).</p>
<p>One thing I still miss is a brief recap of what the term <i>ethnonym</i> means.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Depth issue</span></h2>
<p>The article mentions: "Additionally, nothing longer than eight inches (20 cm) -- be it a penis, a vibrator, or anything else -- should be inserted into the rectum. Objects exceeding eight inches risk colliding with the sigmoid colon, the lining of which is probably not much stronger than a wet paper towel, and trauma can result in internal bleeding with potentially fatal results."</p>
<p>When I saw the passage above, I looked up the <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fisting.html" title="Fisting">fisting</a> article, which mentions nothing of the sort. How accurate is the claim of the eight inches (20cm)? Isn't it safe to do this with some progressive practicing?

<p>It's also hard to reconcile a claim that any part of the digestive tract is "probably not much stronger than a wet paper towel" with the observation that people can swallow and eventually pass things like coins and Lego, while suffering perhaps some pain but seldom "internal bleeding with potentially fatal results."

<dd>Female receptive sex obviously involves completely different organs - a better analogy might be in order, here. I must admit, I don't see the point of seperating "heterosexual" and "homosexual" male anal sex. The division seems somewhat arbitrary and obscure to me and does seem to demonstrate some form of bias in and of itself - why are we playing the identity politics card here? I think for the sake of neutrality we should simply avoid it.

<p>You seem to misunderstand. We wern't debating the homosexual / heterosexual distinction, we were debating a sub-catagory for male receptive heterosexual anal sex. I feel that since men and women differ biologically, discussion of them relating to anal sex should be in different sub-catagories. The more I think about it tho, homosexual and hetrosexual should be in different catagories as well, due to social and cultural differences.

<p>I didn't drive you from the pages you mentioned. You became unable to continue contributing to them because you can't ignore your own baises, which is clearly what is happening here. You want me to discuss your edit? Fine. You changed "making love" to "having anal sex" because (and again, here I quote you) "Anal sex among homosexuals - sex w youths cannot be described as "making love" in a NPOV manner." This demonstrates both an insurmountable bias and a complete ignorance of the subject matter. There are literally hundreds of excellent books on the subject of sexual relationships between adult males and youths that demonstrate unequivocably that "making love" <i>is</i> a perfectly acceptable descriptive.</p>
<p>The lists on my user page don't describe my biases, they point to the articles I've edited.

<blockquote>
<p><a name="Top_and_Bottom" id="Top_and_Bottom"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Top and Bottom</span></h2>
<p>The "recipient", aka "Bottom", is the person whose anus is penetrated. The person is called "Bottom" because in a typical missionary anal sex position that person lies flat and face down while the penetrating partner lies atop the Bottom. The recipient is typically called the Bottom regardless of the position(s) used during the sex act.</p>
<p>==Anal Sex Techniques Some anal sex recipients have somewhat negative experiences, often because the taboo nature of the act precludes candid discussions of how to avoid pain and enhance pleasure.</p>
<p>Anal sex enthusiasts are well-known for correctly saying that, "If it was painful, you were doing it wrong". When done properly, anal sex is an intense and pleasurable form of stimulation.</p>
<p>The most necessary elements of a good experience are communication, lubrication, and relaxation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Communication - it is important that the partners discuss their plans for the experience beforehand. This is especially important when the recipient is a relative novice. The partners can then agree on the kind of experience and the type, speed, gentleness and/or roughness of the stimulation they wish to have. This is also a good time to discuss some "safe words" the recipient can say to signal they wish to stop, pause, or intensify the activity. One suggestion for safe words is "red light", "yellow light" and "green light". This period of communication also allows the partners to discuss fantasies or positions that they might find particularly satisfying.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Lubrication - It is important to emphasize that neither the anus nor the colon produce their own lubrication. The lubrication must be supplied, ideally in abundant quantities, by the sex partners. Lubrication helps to ease initial dilation of the anus, and penetration into the colon, both of which help prevent irritation or minute tearing of those tissues. The colon is lined with a delicate mucous membrane that tears easily, similar to the inside lining of your facial cheeks. This tearing would allow the potential entry of viruses from the top's semen into the bottom's body, which is why it is important to minimize any slight nicks or tears, although no amount of lubrication will completely prevent tearing. As an extra measure of protection against infection, proper use of a condom is highly recommended. Water-based lubrication such as Astroglide or K-Y Jelly should be used, since oil-based products will chemically break down the latex which will probably result in a broken condom. Lubrication can also enhance the pleasure of the recipient partner. The rule of thumb is to use as much lubrication as you think you will need...and then use double that amount. Fully coat the condomed penis or the sex toy with water-based lubrication, paying special attention to the tip. After a few strokes, drip more lubrication onto the penis or the toy.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Relaxation - The purpose of the anus is to remain tightly pursed, in order to retain the body's waste. It must be gently and slowly persuaded to relax. In the same way that an experienced runner prepares for a jog, it is wise to begin slowly and stretch little by little. Often the "top" will caress the buttocks and anus of the recipient, and may lubricate and insert a small finger up to the first knuckle. It may be wise for the "top" to wear a latex glove to prevent infections of any unnoticed nicks on the skin of the finger. The top may also use a small sex toy recommended for anal play with a flared based designed to prevent the toy from being fully inserted and getting stuck inside the bottom's colon, which would require medical attention. After a time, when the bottom signals a willingness, the top may use a thicker finger, a bigger toy, or several fingers. After the bottom senses that they are relaxed and ready to experience the sensations as pleasure, the bottom is ready for penetration by the top.</li>
</ul>
<p>Penetration should be sensuously slow, gentle, and controlled by the bottom.</p>
<p>==Anal sex positions</p>
<ul>
<li>Missionary anal - Although very seldom depicted in erotic movies because it blocks the view of the penetration, this may be a very common position in real life. The bottom lies flat and face down, legs together. After the preparations and relaxations described above, the top will sit astride the bottom with the top's penis or the top's sex toy pointed at the bottom's anus. Slow, gentle penetration can then begin, after which the Top also lies flat entirely on the Bottom's body. This position is very familiar from other kinds of sex, allows the top to feel the curve and shape of the bottom's buttocks, and somewhat minimizes the depth of penetration which may be more comfortable for the Bottom.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Doggy style - This position maximizes the depth of penetration, which may be desirable by Top and / or Bottom, but poses the risk of pushing against the <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigmoid_colon.html" title="Sigmoid colon">sigmoid colon</a>. If the Bottom is a male, this position increases the chances of stimulating the prostate. This position makes easier a more vigorous thrusting action.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Spooning - The Top and Bottom lie on their sides, facing the same direction, with the Top's lubricated penis or toy touching the outside of the Bottom's anus. This allows the Bottom to greatly control initial entry and the depth, speed and force of subsequent thrusting.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Face to face - The bottom lies on her or his back, legs in the air. This can be easier if the bottom is on a bed or table and the top is standing on the floor.</li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Invalid reasons for removal</span></h2>
<p>Everything you stated as your reasons for removal are wrong. Let's destroy them one by one.</p>
<ul>
<li>This information is not only poorly written: The tradition in wikipedia is that if something is poorly written then someone who wishes to contribute - rather than censor - will fix the supposedly poor writing. Since you did not fix it, I wonder what the real problem is.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>it doesn't belong here: Ridiculous on its face, because if discussion of various aspects of anal sex do not belong in the page named "Anal Sex" then where, exactly, do you propose they do belong? And if you don't think they belong here, why didn't you move the material to where you do think it belongs? You don't think the material belongs anywhere, regardless of how informative, instructive or useful it is? Wouldn't editing for personal reasons violate the purpose and spirit of wikipedia?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It amounts to pure speculation: Authoritarian, and false, what a combination. Any well-regarded book about anal sex you care to name will tell you substantially the same helpful information as this section. That means that it is *not* speculation. This means that you are flat-out wrong. So where do you get off calling it speculation, exactly? *You* try shoving something up there without lubrication and without relaxation, and then report to us on whether the material is speculation or not.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>besides which Wikipedia is not an instruction manual - Unless you, personally, own wikipedia you are not in a position to tell me or anybody else for what wikipedia is, or is not. First of all, there is nothing in the wikipedia documents that prohibits instructions as long as they are factual and widely accepted. You and I could find many articles that do contain instructions and illustrations, not to mention there is one such link staring you in the face from a previous poster above.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Much of this information is better covered elsewhere: But you did not link to it. This is one of the big tipoffs that make me so sure that you are not at all interested in keeping wikipedia useful and well-constructed, but rather in just removing material for personal reasons.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>or not needed at all: Also ridiculous on its face, since (as the sections I added point out) the taboo nature of the act precludes candid discussion. There is nothing *more* needed in a page about anal sex than instructions and techniques for how to avoid injury, increase pleasure, and lower the risks of disease. You have a spectacular talent for blanket statements that turn out laughably wrong.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because all of your reasons are null and void, I am attempting to restore the deleted sections and if I ever find them removed I am going to call for a vote on whether the material should be removed or, as I suspect will happen because there is no valid reason for removal, simply edited to make it better</p>

<p><i>"In some cultures, only males who are penetrated by other males are considered homosexual, while males who penetrate other males are not."</i></p>
<p>I find that pretty bizzare. How can the male who penetrates other males for sexual pleasure not be considered homosexual? What cultures are we talking about here?</p>

<dd>You guys have obviously not studied sociology. In nearly all cultures and situations, a man who is exclusively the "pitcher" or "top" is straight (esp. when he dates, and perhaps even prefers women), whereas a man who is the bottom is seen at best as effeminate, and at worst as exclusively homosexual. Pitchers are nearly always older, more affluent and macho, and the "catchers"... less so, w an emphasis on effeminate impoverished boys of low social standing. This is true in most indigenous peoples, w ancient greeks, and in modern prisons. It is <i>not</i> true however in modern gay culture, which is utterly exceptional. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">¸,ø¤º°`°º¤ø,¸</a><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESam_Spade_3418.html" title="User talk:Sam Spade">¸,ø¤º°`°º¤ø,¸</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Emailuser&amp;target=Sam_Spade" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Emailuser&amp;target=Sam_Spade" rel="nofollow">¸,ø¤º°`°º¤ø,¸</a> 21:31, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Not quite, Sam, and please keep your homophobia to yourself. In some cultures in some historical periods men who had sex with men but exclusively took the active role in <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anal_sex.html" title="Anal sex">anal sex</a> were not considered "<a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay.html" title="Gay">gay</a>" or "homosexual," <u>in part because there was no such concept in those times</u>. In many societies, such activity was considered normative (see Ancient Greece, <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shudo.html" title="Shudo">Ancient Japan</a>), and the penetrated male was normally younger than the penetrator, and involved in a mentor-like relationship with him. The younger males would in time grow up to themselves take the active role in anal sex with younger males. Such males were not considered any less masculine than any other male in society, and engaging in sex with other males did not preclude engaging in sex with women.</p>
<p>In addition, the penetrated male was <i>not</i> exclusively "effeminate, impoverished, or of low social standing." In fact, many of them grew up to very highly regarded in society for one reason or other, and there are records of emperors and noblemen in all major societies who had particularly cherished male lovers.</p>
<p>In other cases, particularly in cultures where <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homophobia.html" title="Homophobia">homophobia</a> is rife, the simple act of anally penetrating another male does not require self-identification as gay, and will not result in being labelled as such. Prisons are one example. In such cases, the one being penetrated is sometimes feminized (eg: in <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prison_sexuality.html" title="Prison sexuality">prisons</a> they are often called "bitches"), but not always. In still other cases, the mere fact of <a href="../../../m/s/m/MSM_2661.html" title="MSM">having sex with other men</a> does not preclude identifying as <a href="../../../h/e/t/Heterosexuality.html" title="Heterosexuality">straight</a>, for example see the <a href="../../../d/o/w/Down_low.html" title="Down low">Down low</a>.</p>
<p>And modern gay culture is far from "exceptional" in these regards. Egalitarian male-male erotic and romantic relationships have always existed in which the claims Sam makes did not apply.</p>

I most certainly am not afraid of homosexuality, that would be a severe hinderance professionally, as a counselor and therapist. I'm afraid of nothing with God on my side.

<dd>Would you mind sourcing it, EB? If you provide here on this page a source, or preferably sources, for its being considered more pleasurable for a man, Sam cannot complain at its inclusion. My view is that you are correct that it is often <i>considered</i> so but that we ought to be careful not to be seen to <i>endorse</i> the practice, because that in itself represents a POV (one I share with you, EB, but even so, we should strive not to work our own bias into the page).<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 03:00, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My big problem with the statement, as I've said, is that it contradicts information given elsewhere in the article and in other articles. The other issue is that I simply don't believe it. This is the type of thing that's exceedingly difficult to source, so we <i>have</i> to resort to what is "often considered"; in this case I fail to see how extreme tightness of the anus would be a source of pleasure for the receptive partner. <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> 04:56, September 9, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm afraid Wikipedia articles are not useful sources for Wikipedia articles. It's a problem that WP increasingly faces that editors insist that if it's said here, that's authoritative, when the truth is that WP is a tertiary source and articles need to be sourced to primary or secondary sources where possible. Your beliefs, EB, are not good sources either. Please read <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">this</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_your_sources_2f5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite your sources">this</a>.

<p>This is a misrepresentation of my edit, and my position. As I have made clear for a VERY long time (my first edit to the wikipedia was in this regards, and can be found up near the top of the page), I oppose the anti-female receptive anal sex bias of this article. I support what the article currently states "One appeal of heterosexual anal sex is the fact that the anus is tighter than the vagina. This is often considered to lead to a more pleasurable experience.", and would add (were the article unprotected) that the taboo status of the act adds to the intellectual erotica of the act. some citations:</p>

<li>2 Sam, who it must be noted, isn't gay, persists in adding the claim that "<b>The most common [gay slang] term for a top is a "Pitcher," whereas a bottom is often called a "catcher."</b>" This is untrue. <i>Pitcher</i> and <i>catcher</i> are slang terms used by <i>some</i> gay people, yes, but by far and away the most common terms are <i>top</i> and <i>bottom</i>. For Sam the link to <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay_slang.html" title="Gay slang">gay slang</a> apparently isn't enough.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Why must it be noted that Sam isn't gay? His opinion is worth nothing here, and it would be worth no more were he gay. What is worth something is <i>properly sourced</i> material. Sam, you need to source this contention or it has to go. If he does source it appropriately, EB, you have to allow it in fairness. By appropriately, I mean he must find a gay source that says so, and reference it correctly in the text. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 03:00, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is rather a non-issue, I restored the claim because EB never explained whe he removed it, and instead focused on other aspects of his extensive revert. I make no claims regarding this sentance, or the <i>Pitcher</i>/<i>catcher</i> paradigm, and am glad to compromise on this issue. If EB feels this is a common set of terms used by some, then it should probably be clarified as such and included, but thats up to him. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 15:19, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">descriptions</span></h3>
<ol>
<li>3 The descriptions. I find it exceedingly odd that Sam, who has crusaded (and I use the term advisedly) against descriptions of sexual activity in Wikipedia, would insist on adding such nonsense to this article. The disputed sections read as follows:</li>
</ol>
<p>Missionary anal</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although very seldom depicted in erotic movies because it blocks the view of the penetration, this may be a very common position in real life. The bottom lies flat and face down, legs together. After the preparations and relaxations described above, the top will sit astride the bottom with the top's penis or the top's sex toy pointed at the bottom's anus. Slow, gentle penetration can then begin, after which the top also lies flat entirely on the bottom's body. This position is very familiar from other kinds of sex, allows the top to feel the curve and shape of the bottom's buttocks, and somewhat minimizes the depth of penetration which may be more comfortable for the bottom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This paragraph is not only rife with <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weasel_word.html" title="Weasel word">weasel words</a> ("very seldom," "may be"), but the description cannot be called accurate. This paragraph suggests that there is some accepted procedure for having anal sex in this position, or that the term "missionary anal" is even a common term, neither of which is true. The sentence "This position is very familiar from other kinds of sex" makes no sense and verges on being non-neutral.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting, given the claim about "pitcher" and "catcher," that all of these descriptons use "top" and "bottom" exclusively.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>How does Sam know it's "very seldom" shown in erotic movies? Can he source a study of erotic movies that says so? If not, it should not be included. Again, his personal research is not admissible to Wikipedia. This doesn't even sound like a missionary position to me. The reference to "other kinds of sex" is just weird. It's only familiar if you do that kind of position when not doing anal sex. Again, Sam's personal research is not admissible. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 03:00, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sam's not being gay again comes into play here; since he's not gay I doubt he's seen many gay porn movies. I also note again the suggestion that there is some accepted procedure for having anal sex (in this position or any other), or that the term "missionary anal" is even a common term. <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> 04:56, September 9, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I'm not <i>entirely</i> sure that's the case here, to be fair, but I take your point. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 06:19, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Doggy style</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This position maximizes the depth of penetration, which may be desirable by the top and/or bottom, but poses the risk of pushing against the sigmoid colon. If the bottom is a male, this position increases the chances of stimulating the prostate. This position makes easier a more vigorous thrusting action.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
<br /></p>
<p>This is not the position that maximises the depth of penetration. I have doubts about the claim about protrate stimulation, too, given that it's not very far in and isn't difficult to locate and stimulate. The claim about "vigorous thrusting action" probably isn't strictly accurate either, as such things depend on the individuals performing the act and their specific abilities.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Both the item about penetration and the item about the prostate need to be sourced. Whether it makes a "more vigorous thrusting action" or not would surely depend on who's doing the thrusting. If Sam is again basing this on personal research, and cannot source it to something reputable, it must come out. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 03:00, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, he still wouldn't have a case for including instructions. There is no one way of having anal sex, or of doing most things.

I could go on. There are problems with the descriptions of "spooning" and "face to face" as well. Do we need detailed descriptions of each sexual position?</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../v/a/g/Vaginal_sex.html" title="Vaginal sex">vaginal sex</a> article has none of that. The <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missionary_position.html" title="Missionary position">missionary position</a> article has much better written descriptions but <i>doesn't even mention anal sex.</i> The <a href="../../../d/o/g/Doggy_style.html" title="Doggy style">doggy style</a> article <i>does</i> mention anal sex. The article is better written than the description here, but still verges on the non-academic in several areas. I wouldn't use it as an example.<br />
<br />
The same goes for <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spooning.html" title="Spooning">spooning</a>, which has a noticeable heterosexual bias.</p>

<p>And while we're on the subject, reverse cowboy/girl redirects to <a href="../../../r/e/v/Reverse_amazon.html" title="Reverse amazon">reverse amazon</a> (shouldn't it be Amazon?), which also has a definite heterosexual bias among other neutrality issues.

<dl>

<dd>You can't have it both ways. Either the reverse amazon article is POV because it has "heterosexual bias" or it's wrongminded to suggest that you can have anal reverse amazon.

<dd>This very post consists of the type of attacks you falsly accuse me of. You can't oppose the unprotection of a page you refuse to discuss, Sam. <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> 02:17, September 9, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Then let's have a fair and structured mediation. Say the word and I'll set up a page. Let's try for a solution that has both of you walk away content with the finished product. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 03:00, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That sounds great, you have my full support. I just noticed your dialogue w EB above, and will be glad to contribute to the discussion and provide the neccessary citations when I have a moment. If need be I'll leave notes on everyones pages (heck, even mine!) and request a formal mediation or whatever formalities he's looking for, but they arn't neccessary as far as I'm concerned. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 14:48, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Look, i don't get where the "instructions" issue comes in... simply put, i'm a heterosexual, virile youth with a heterosexual, virile partner interested in exploring and experimenting with our sexuality. i look to wikipedia as being an academic and mature (ok, strange choice of wording contextually speaking) source for information, one that i can type in something like "anal sex" and recieve actual information rather than extreme gay porn or something along those lines. i wouldn't even consider googling that, ha. In searching for the article "anal sex," i was somewhat interested in the history and such, yes, but also how it is practiced. perhaps all this information is present in other articles, spread over the depths of wikipedia, but even so, it's not linked to. i believe we may suffer some degree of redundance for the sake ease of use... the other sources given within wikipedia seemed to be entirely different articles in entirely different source lines. the "how to" part of the article may be viewed as grotesque or similar verbage, but it's information none-the-less, the single thing wikipedia is built upon. i feel that no information, especially information on lines such as this--that would very difficult to obtain without "wading through the muck," should be excluded. my point is, the "how to" is applicable, clean (relatively speaking), and useful, often required information.</dd>

<dd>on the redundance issue, the only way i can describe it is visually, something like "anal sex" is a branch, leading to all the sub-groups and sub-jects which should contain ALL the information on and relating to said branch, through links and the like. this would be different from the "health" or "intercourse" article, maybe only tied by a thread... oh dear, this is some profound philosophical questions regarding the organization and format of wikipedia, which i imagine were inevitable to surface. maybe i'm wrong? the point is, "anal sex" and the proper way to go about is much better suited to be in the "anal sex" article, not existant as ONLY some single sentance in the "intercourse" article. oh man, i would sign, but i don't even know my name... i'll say MMMMMM</dd>

<dd>good points, I agree. debates like the above tend to forget the needs of the reader, and I thank you for reminding us of our purpose here. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 13:20, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Then, Sam, would you mind dropping a note onto EB's talkpage and copy mine, asking him to join you and me in informal mediation? I had hoped we could all avoid anything too heavy, but if he needs you to ask him on his talkpage, please do it and then we can make a subpage and get on with it. I'm sure you can resolve your issues but I think it will be helpful to have a *kof* referee, so that if accusations of "personal attacks" and so on are thrown around, you have someone to say "actually, that was a bit near the bone" etc. Fair enough? <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 05:32, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Unprotection</span></h3>
<p>If EB agrees to stop editing the article until mediation is completed, I will likewise. We can always discuss concerns here on the talk page if absolutely necessary. If EB and gracenote agree (in writing, below), I suggest we request for unprotection. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 13:47, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well yes, of course, if both of you agree not to edit, there is no problem with the page and other editors should be allowed to edit it. If EB joins the agreement, perhaps Fvw would unlock it. If either of you break it, he will, I'm sure, lock it straight back up again on the version you changed it from. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 07:15, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm unprotecting this.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Initial image too large</span></h2>
<p>When unlocked, can we shrink the initial image to a more standard size? At 300px, it seems obtrusive on the body text. A standard unsized frame is better, or perhaps explicitly sized at 200px. Obviously, readers who want more image detail can click for the full sized image. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 19:51, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>IMHO, they don't appear to be entirely "nonsense"; for the most part, they look like different ways of phrasing the existing content. It could stand a POV cleanup and some copyediting, though. - <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJredmond_3335.html" title="User:Jredmond">jredmond</a> 20:58, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>The mention of the terms "Greek love" and "Greek" have been removed. They need replacing.</li>
<li>The term "homosexual sodomy" is inherently non-neutral.</li>
<li>Replacing "according to some studies" with "studies have shown that" is a subtle change of meaning that is not entirely neutral or accurate.</li>
<li>"No reliable statistics are available" is better than "we cannot be certain."</li>
<li>"It may be that" is weaselly.</li>
<li>Since data on homosexual behavior tends to arouse such controversy, it is difficult to make solid claims in this area" is again non-neutral.</li>
<li>The phrase "in defining who counts as 'gay'" is redundant.</li>

<dd>I cleaned up quite a bit of that in an edit done right after my earlier comment: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anal_sex&amp;diff=23700832&amp;oldid=23654406" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anal_sex&amp;diff=23700832&amp;oldid=23654406" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.
