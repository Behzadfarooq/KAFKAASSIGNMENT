<p>Hello. This is an interesting article. There is an assertation towards the end that analog computers are used in earthquake prediction, and that they're superior to digital computers for that purpose. That is an interesting assertion. I wonder if someone has some references about that. I searched the web but all I found were two refs (no. 166 and 167) at <a href="http://books.nap.edu/books/0309065623/html/19.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.nap.edu/books/0309065623/html/19.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>; these two date from the 1940's.

<p>I put that in there and admittedly I don't recall where I learned it, but I am certain that it is true. I am quite certain that there are also many other applications in which a specialized analog computer is superior to a digital computer.</p>
<p>I don't however, find this interesting. I find it interesting, rather, that it is in general found interesting. After all, a digital computer is just a special type of analog computer, and it has been known for a long time that hybrid computers are far more powerfull than digital computers, at least for sceintific problems. (Try your local library.)</p>
<p>In any case, I assure you that the assertion can be confirmed. -- <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_baas_eec8.html" title="User:Kevin baas">Kevin Baas</a> 03:21, 20 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The article gives an indication to why this would be true though.

<p>Concerning the computing elements of electronic analog computers: The list given in the article is not correct:</p>
<p>All active computing elements (apart from multipliers) change the sign, so summing terms will automatically change the sign of the result, inverting should be removed from this general list (some analog computers had special summers with only one input called "inverters", but these are summers nevertheless).</p>
<p>Exponentiation and log-calculation are no basic operations for an analog computer. When these functions are needed they are normally implemented using a diode based function generator which approximates the exp-/log-function by polygons which is quite erroneous so these operations are avioded whereever possible! Sometimes exponentiation can be performed by integration (which, by the way, changes the sign of the result, too).</p>
<p>The multiplication is missing in the basic operations - every practical analog computer has multipliers, normal were servo multipliers, time division multipliers and parabola multipliers. Some more arcane schemes used special electron tubes like the "Hyperbelfeld"-Tube developed at the University of Technology Darmstadt.</p>
<p>Normally differentiation is a no no in analog computing since deriving a function will increase the noise! Normally the differential equations to be solved will be integrated so many times that all derivatives will vanish. This results in low noise and makes differentiation normally unnecessary. There are trick circuits to convert an integrator into a differentiator by using an open summer (inverted function).</p>

<p>There's a quite straightforward way to multiply with electrical-only circuits. All you need is a couple of quarter-squarers, then use the relationship ab = ((a+b)/2)**2 - ((a-b)/2)**2. Or you can use the <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hall_effect.html" title="Hall effect">Hall effect</a> for direct multiplication. PML.</p>
<p>Believe me, my electronics is pretty rusty. I assume what you say is true, so I removed the electro-mechanical reference, but then added <i>multiplication</i> and <i>division</i> to the list of operations. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENormxxx_241f.html" title="User:Normxxx">normxxx</a> 12:55, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>From the article:</b> <i>Analog systems are understood only as continuous, time variant electrical systems. From the above discussion, it should be obvious that this is not correct.</i></p>
<p>Could someone expand on this passage? I'm not sure it's obvious to the layman.</p>
<p><i>I am sure it's not.</i> But I'm equally not sure that the necessary elaboration (e.g., involving discontinuous functions) would improve things. Do we really need to be this detailed? Can we omit it?</p>
<p>Also, where I went to school, <b>Turing</b> machines were for <i>digital</i> computers <i>only</i> and slide rules were considered <i>analog</i> devices, since the calculations are continuous. (Try using a circular slide rule equivalent to about a hundred feet or so to see that you can get any gradation you can eyeball.) Simple voltmeters and ammeters are marked— does that make them digital? <b>Digital computers manipulate symbols (1's and 0's for the Turing machine); analog computers manipulate physical values, e.g., voltages, amperages, amd waveforms.</b> <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENormxxx_241f.html" title="User:Normxxx">normxxx</a> 13:28, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>My last changes, after my (digital) computer ate them one time, are substantial. And, I am definitely out-of-date. But in my youth (in the late '50s and early '60s, when analog radar was gradually converting to digital (by way of hybrid) and flight simulators were all analog, I was a hot shot analog computerist and could "simulate" systems (generally non-mathematically, although I liked using Boolean for switching circuits) in my sleep.

<p>From the article: <i>In fact, digital also has a precise technical definition. In the context of circuits, it refers to the use of binary electrical pulse codes for symbols and the manipulation of these symbols in the operation of the digital computer.</i></p>
<p>Some memory technologies use more than two voltage levels. Some computers use(d) base-ten arithmetic; "binary" seems to indicate base-two arithmetic. The phrase "pulse codes" implies time-variance, whereas a computer's clock can be stopped and then continued without loss of data (unless it uses DRAM).</p>
<p>Perhaps "discrete voltage levels" should replace "binary electrical pulse codes."</p>

<p>The content is great but this reads like a college text book. I don't feel I'm an idiot, but I had to read the first paragraph three times before I understood exactly what was being said. Any 5th grader trying to find out what an analog computer is is going to be blown away. Wiki guidelines specify that articles should start out very simple, and progress to more difficult processes.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"An analog computer is a form of computer that uses electrical or mechanical phenomena to model the problem being solved by using one kind of physical quantity to represent another. The central concept among all analog computers can be better understood by examining the definition of an analogy. The similarities of an analogy define the salient characteristics of the comparison, but the differences in an analogy are also important. Modeling a real physical system in a computer is called simulation."</dd>
</dl>
<p>This could be said as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"An analog computer is a computer that uses one physical quantity to represent another."</dd>
</dl>
<p>This paragraph could end right here and people would be more enlightened than had they read the whole entire first paragraph. The rest is tangential information that doesn't really help or clarify. How are knowing the differences important? In what way does knowing the definition of analogy help understand analog computers? These questions should be answered if this content is to be kept. The sentence about simulation is out of the blue. <a href="../../../e/p/a/User%7EEpachamo_69f9.html" title="User:Epachamo">Epachamo</a> 15:46, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I read this in a short letter replying to one of their articles in Scientific American, on the subject of analog computers, some time about 1985. Rem being completely blown out by it. The writer said he worked in some kind of Surveyor's Dept, and they had the job of providing accurate data on the areas of farms and the like with very complex borders. All traditional calculation methods involved splitting up a map of the land into regular-shaped plane figures, measuring those, and then doing the same with the leftover bits and so on until you judge the remaining bits to be negligible. All very fiddly and time consuming.</p>
<p>His group adopted a technique that was the essence of simplicity, effectiveness and cheapness. Say you have a map of some area with a very complex border,(let's use Norway with its fjord indented coast as an example), and you have to calculate its area. Simply put this map on a piece of cardboard and trace over Norway's borders. Now cut out the shape of Norway from the cardboard. Put this cardboard cutout on one cup of a fine balance scale, and put a (pre-prepared) square piece of cardboard representing say 1000 sq kilometres in the other. Now read out the difference in weight. This immediately tells you the exact area of Norway or any irregular shaped piece of land, in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>Back in 1985, I worked next door to a Public Service office (the Lands Department) that had a section of about 20 people devoted full-time to just such calculations. When they heard about this idea, it was estimated that the entire section could be reduced to 6 people, saving millions of dollars and providing better approximations. Of course it was never done. But the idea still intrigues me.</p>
<p>I do agree that the definition of analog computer could be simplified and clarified at the same time, although it *is* one of those concepts that is hard to pin down in words. In the case described here, it can be clearly seen that there are two physical quantities involved, in this case, weight and surface area, and that these are linked by a very simple formula. One quantity is hard to measure (surface area) and the other is easy (weight). Because the two systems are linked, we can get a result for the difficult-to-measure quantity without having to directly measure it. Instead, we calculate the easy-to-measure quantity and *deduce* the hard-to-measure quantity from that.</p>
<p>I wish Wikipedia writers would proceed along these lines when it comes to explaining things. It goes to show that laypeople writing for laypeople does not necessarily make for clarity and brevity. In fact, it often does the reverse. It shows that writing clearly for a general readership is a specialised skill in itself, often undervalued. It may seem counterintuitive but the greatest blight on expository writing by amateurs for amateurs is not through their oversimplification of things, but the reverse, that through not being trained as teachers and communicators, they burden down the exposition with so much technical detail and minutiae, that the average reader is in over his head after a couple of pars.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is full of articles striving to be comprehensive and completely accurate, and forgetting that they are being read by ordinary Joes who just want to get the jist of the matter. Bit odd for a people's encyclopedia, don't you think? Back to basics, comrades, back to basics. Myles325</p>
