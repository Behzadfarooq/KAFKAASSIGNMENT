<p>In the following clause:</p>
<p>As a young Austrian soldier, <a href="../../../l/u/d/Ludwig_Wittgenstein_69e0.html" title="Ludwig Wittgenstein">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a> expanded and developed Russell's logical atomism into a comprehensive system in a brief book, the <i><a href="../../../t/r/a/Tractatus_Logico-Philosophicus_29f9.html" title="Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus">Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</a></i>. The world is the existence of certain states of affairs; these states of affairs can be expressed in the language of first-order predicate logic. So a <i>picture</i> of the world can be built up by expressing atomic facts in atomic propositions, and linking them using <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_operator.html" title="Logical operator">logical operators</a>.</p>
<p>i restructured the first sentence to what is shown, removing the POV word "remarkable." Also, the entire clause is in need of clarification: are the statements made a summary of viewpoints from the book? i can only assume this is so, but it's not entirely clear. As i am personally unfamiliar with analytic philosophy, this is a clarification job for someone else to do. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMiraFirefly_80ad.html" title="User:MiraFirefly">MiraFirefly</a> 21:50, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think it would be useful (as a critique of analytic philosophy) -to mention the influence of Nietzschean perspectivism over continental philosophy and the social sciences in general. Analytic philosophy is averse to anything that eludes the analytic framework. Continental philosophy craves for perspectives -and thus the influence from the social sciences, history, psychology, etc.</p>
<p>Analytical philosophy is also an ATTITUDE -i.e. mocking continental positions by invoking half-ass comments about the words they are expressed in. For a very good criticism of analytic attitude/posturing, see the first issue of 'Radical Philosophy' on 'Professional philosophers'. Also, the Penguin dictionary of Philosophy has a very powerful (albeit short)criticism of analytic philosophy. Analytic philosophy goes round in circles and does not achieve much -but 'hey, we're consistent/right and logical, no?'. In a world marked by the death of God, I fear these kids have gone mad! --Cookydog.</p>

<p>I don't think it would be useful to discuss Nietzsche's influence on continental philosophy because it has no relation to analytic philosophy at all. If you wish to mention Nietzsche in the criticism of analytic philosophy section featured on the page, go for it, but it seems to be well written as is.</p>
<p>In terms of your normative claims, not every analytic philosopher is completely averse to anything not analytic. Some analytic philosophers have attempeted to logically analyze continental positions. For example, many people read Plato from a continental viewpoint, but a lot of studies like those done by Gallop have tried to logically analyze Plato. Most intuitions, from any philosophy or perspective, are logically analyzable and probably contain some form of an argument structure. Of course, if you look at some of the implications of analytic philosophy, especially the logical positivists and Wittgenstein, there are things a continental philosopher can also take from that and argue for or against. On the other hand, here's a link to an article written by Keith DeRose where he tries to tackle his failure to understand, and severe distaste of, postmodernism ... <a href="http://bengal-ng.missouri.edu/~kvanvigj/certain_doubts/index.php?p=453" class="external free" title="http://bengal-ng.missouri.edu/~kvanvigj/certain_doubts/index.php?p=453" rel="nofollow">http://bengal-ng.missouri.edu/~kvanvigj/certain_doubts/index.php?p=453</a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, I imagine that most analytic philosophers would understand the fallacy in mocking a philosophical position. An analytic philosopher is very aware that sound argumentation isn't performed with extreme emotion and attacks. However, sometimes a word or two in jest is quite separate from a full-blown derviable argument against another philosopher's position.</p>

<p>It is also interesting to note that while the logical positivist, Rudolf Carnap let loose on Heidegger in "The Elimination of Metaphysics Through Logical Analysis of Language," he had nothing but praise for Nietzsche. There, Carnap discerned similarities between Nietzsche's critique of metaphysics as found in say *Human, All too Human* and his own. He seems to have regarded Nietzsche as a "metaphyscian" who had the good sense to avoid the errors for which he reproached other metaphysicians. He admired the "empirical content" of Nietzsche's work, including especially its "historical analyses of specific artistic phenomena, or a historical-psychological analysis of morals." And he praised Nietzsche for having chosen the medium of poetry in such works as *Thus Spoke Zarathustra* for presenting his ideas rather attempting to present them in a theoretical treatise. The fact that Carnap found much to praise in the work of Nietzsche is significant since in "The Elimination of Metaphysics Through Logical Analysis of Language," Carnap went on the attack against Heidegger, whose metaphysical statements, Carnap dismissed as meaningless. Apparently for Carnap,part of Nietzsche's greatness was the fact that he used poetic means for expressing himself. This fit in with Carnap's view that metaphysics fails because it makes meaningless statements. For Carnap, language had a variety of functions to perform. One of those is the making cognitively meaningful statements. Other functions include the making of what Carnap described as emotive statements. Such language can express Lebensgefühl. Metaphysics attempts to express Lebensgefühl too but fails because it can only issue meaningless statements. The appropriate means for expressing Lebensgefühl is art rather than metaphysics, and Nietzsche was praised by Carnap for realizing that. For Carnap, Nietzsche was the metaphysician who had the greatest artistic talent.</p>
<p>BTW I have recently been reading Arthur Danto's Nietzsche book. There Danto makes the point that Nietzsche in his work anticipated some of the central ideas of 20th century philosophical movements including logical positivism and existentialism. Curiously, enough, I can find no reference in Danto's book to Carnap. --JimFarm 01:48, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This article states that this is the dominant form of philosophy in English speaking countries. Among the college educated, isn't it also the dominant form of philosophy in Russian and other nations in the former Soviet Union? Outside of religious schools, isn't it also the dominant form of philosophy in Israel? <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 19:51, 5 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Perfectly true. Also Scandinavia and Japan, if I am correctly informed. And, for that matter, France and Germany despite what literary theorists would have us believe. (that Descombes is more philosophically significant than Derrida, is what I mean.) But that doesn't make the article's claim contenious, since, while it does say that most philosophy practiced in the English speaking world is analytic; it does not say or imply that this is not true of other countries as well. This is sensible for two reasons: (1) This is an English enyclopedia, and it is most useful to adress what <i>philosophy</i> denotes to speakers of English. (2) <i>Analytic</i> is most likely to be contrasted, if at all, with <i>Continental</i>; constraining its claim to generality within the English speaking world forestalls complaints by "Continentalists" that they are being maltreated. (Or perhaps oppressed.)</dd>

<p>Without wishing to seem defensive I'd say that in my limited experience continental philosophers spend far more time taking a haughty attitude towards analytic philosophy than vice versa. As to your claim that analytic philosophy doesn't achieve much, I'd dispute that but it really depends on your definition of achieve. I think it's practice creates a greater clarity of mind and allows for a deeper understanding of important philosophical questions and plausible positions in response to them, even if analytic philosophers only rarely reach a consensus on what the right answers are. Besides if your complaint about it not achieving much is in relation to analytic philosophers rarely reaching consensuses much the same could be said of the alternatives. Also in terms of achievements look at the mathematical discoveries inspired and connected to analytic philosophy. Also consider interdisciplinary work that analytic philosophers do with computer science, cog sci, physics and other sciences.</p>

In a broad sense, you could call all rigorous, well-thought-out philosophy "analytic philosophy", if you wanted, but nobody uses the term that way, and the article is quite explicit that the term names philosophy descended from Russell, Frege, and Moore, and, by extension, any post-Russell-Frege-Moore philosophy working with a certain amount of technical rigour and use of logic, etc. <i>This</i> "analytic philosophy" did not exist before Marx or Hegel--couldn't have--and was, in the case of Russell and Moore , very clearly and explicitly a reaction against Hegel and Hegelians. (Frege was only ever considered an analytic philosopher retrospectively, largely via the work of Michael Dummett.) And, in any case, this sense of "analytic philosophy" is the one intended by all but the most casual contemporary use of the term by all philosophers I've read.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>More to the point, (regarding the context of the remark you quote) analytic philosophy in fact did produce almost no politicial philosophy until <i>A Theory of Justice.</i> That very fact seems to constitute a much bigger criticism of early analytic philosophy than claiming that they rejected Hegel, which, if anything, at least offers them an excuse for not theorizing about politics. Most assessments of Rawls' contribution to philosophy will point to this exact fact, uncontroversially to my knowledge. In any case, analytic philosophy <i>can</i> do political theory (case in point), and the remark certainly wasn't intended as "bashing". (I wrote it, along with the paragraph earlier on this "talk" page assessing the (lack of) merits of the "analytic" and "continental" distinction.)</dd>

<p>Missed this comment first time round... MacIntyre's exposure to (and reaction against) ordinary language philosophy, and his study of Wittgenstein in the days when only analytics were excited about him, have left a distinctly analytic imprint on him: have a look at the philosophical articles in <i>Against the Self Images of the Age</i>. Certainly, his involvement with Thomism doesn't look very analytic, but if you take a step back, there's something similar about the path he has taken and that which Williams has. And while we're at it, he did his philosophy boot camp in the UK, which makes him a British philosopher in my eyes. --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 14:21, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think Macintyre (along with Martin Jay, but thats another story for another time) is a philosopher whose work shows how meaningless (in both the ordinary language and philosophical sense) the distinction between 'analytic' and 'continental' philosophy becomes whenever it attempts to incorporate the work of a philosopher who fails to accept the self-images of the age, as it were. While he certainly has no lack of training in the methodology of anglo-american philosophy, his historicist approach to philosophical speculation and his 'narrative consciousness' theories are far from standard operating procedure. He has also written approvingly about Freud, and felt the need to specifically engage with Lacan over differences in interpretation of psychoanalytic theory. Asking whether Macintyre is analytic or continental is like asking if John Lennon is a mod or a rocker. As far as he is concerned, he's an aristotelian and that is that.Jimmyq2305 19:39, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Analytic is characterized, normally, by its effort to clarify philosophical issues by analysis and <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_rigor.html" title="Logical rigor">logical rigor</a>--i.e., by method (2), above. This seems to imply that other philosophies do not care for logical rigor. Furthermore G.E. Moores defense of common sense realism and ethical intuitionism does not really owe much to logical rigour. Instead, common sense and intuitionims relies on supposedly self-evident facts (because of the lack of logical arguments). That's my humble opinion. Kikl 12:44, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This shows clearly the reason for the close relationship between philosophy of language and analytic philosophy. Language is the principal—or perhaps the only—tool of the philosopher.

<p>The first sentence of that excerpt is pretty astonishing. I would have thought that identifying the single most 'interesting utterance from the point of view of the method of analytic philosophy' would be a bold undertaking for a lone writer, with no NPOV obligations to worry about, let alone a Wikipedia article.</p>
<p>The rest of the excerpt presents Wittgensteinian quietism as a universal characteristic of analytic philosophy, which is patently false. Obviously quietism is fairly prevalent in anayltic philosophy, but so is antagonism to it, even amongst philosophers who support the central role of philosophy of language.</p>
<p>All in all, this section strikes me as pushing an agenda, and falling far short of NPOV.</p>

<p>As I read the article I noticed that there was no section or even a sentence about criticism of Analytic Philosophy. Could someone do some sources for Criticism of the topic so that both sides can be heard?</p>
<p>I believe an example of a critic of this Philosophy was Ayn Rand but I can't remember in what book she wrote about the subject. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Fading_Light_2d38.html" title="User:The Fading Light">The Fading Light</a> 9:21, 21 March 2006</p>
<p>Actually, the article features a fairly lengthy criticism in its section on the analytic ethical position and in the section talking about its relations to continental philosophy. The article notes that Philippa Foot vigorously attacked the logical positivist stance on ethics, and also says that Wittgenstein realized that his logical atomism "solution to all of philosophy" was inadequate. Also there is this explicitly critical passage, "analytic philosophy, under one interpretation, failed by its own systematic lights to demonstrate the meaninglessness or fictitiousness of the concepts it attacked. At least, few analytic philosophers today would agree that they have anything like an exact and proven theory of which terms are meaningful and which meaningless. Contemporary analytic philosophy journals are — for good or ill — as rich in metaphysics as any continental philosopher." Also, I always thought that Ayn Rand supported analytic philosophy, especially from what I read of the collection of her lectures in <i>Objectivism: the Philosophy of Ayn Rand</i>. However, I'm not certain about this. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrizimm_efa0.html" title="User:Brizimm">Brizimm</a> 05:38, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The german version is very nice and readable, yet does have quite a different narrative, if not so say tells a completely different story than the english version. Maybe someone could cross-check them. Anyway, the German thing ends with stating that, since the 80ies, Analytical philosophy is critized for being ahistoric and not taking into account the subjective nature of natural language, therefore making 'objective', positivist truth finding via language and logic unviable. Pretty much the same argument I heard from a Prof from the University of Vienna (Franz Martin Wimmer, you can google him). He specializes in intercultural philosophy and is interested in the way language forms the ontological systems we think and operate in. By the way, Poststructuralism is not dead and any important political philosophy of the last 30 years of course is based on or influenced by Michel Foucault, who is very close to a God (but of course, you anglophony philosopher don't believe in him either).

<p>I note the improvements made in this section recently but still it gives the impression that Analytic offers no critique of Hegel.

<p>I dont think that illuminating the relation to Continental is served by one-sided "news-flash" quotations from the Euro-Society for Analytic Philosophy without any historical setting. Is not a claim of reivival from such a party obviously POV, too temporal, and in their interest, as it attempts to stimulate demand for their own organization and in their once per three year meetings?</p>
<p>Also it gives only the relation of Analytic to the Continent of Europe, not its relation to Continental philosophy.</p>
<p>The list of countries given is incomplete and adequate. If one person teaches/studies Analytic amongst the 80m Germans, does German get listed? By giving such a long list you give the impression of an accuracy which is not there. I think we need to clarify the fact that Analytic and Continental are taught in most Universities the world over but that in certain places one is more predominant. Most US/UK universities also have offerings (however meagre) of Continental philosophy and vice-versa. <span style="font-style:oblique">-- <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">Lucas</a> <a href="../../../l/u/c/User_talk%7ELucaas_1582.html" title="User talk:Lucaas">(Talk)</a></span> 21:29, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

But what about the Vienna Circle's association with leftist politics ("most of us, myself included, were socialists" - Carnap), as published in the Wissenschaftliche Weltauffassung? Russell's numerous political publications and highly visible antiwar activism, from WWI to Vietnam? Popper's massive book against totalitarianism? Rorty and Putnam were practically Communists in the 60s and 70s. Oh, and Chomsky and Rawls and Nozick and Sen and Williams and.... Yeah, except for them, analytic philosophy had "little to say about political ideas".</p>

<p>I would say that analytic philosophy as philosophy had little to say about politics until Rawls.

1. The introduction contains no overall characterisation of what analytic philosophy is (by a 'characterisation' I mean a list of characateristics or features that would allow the reader easily to identify the characterised thing when he or she saw it, and also to identify anything else as not being the characterised thing). It says it is a dominant philosophical movement (yes, but what are the distinguishing features, slogans, beliefs, methods of that movement), that its founders were Moore and Russell (who were they, asked the uninformed reader), that these in turn were influenced by Frege (who was he?) and that many leading analytics came from Germany and Austria (OK, but what actually is analytic philosophy?). There is then the usual Wiki list of analytic philosophers (fine, but who are these people and what do they do for a living – what actually is analytic philosophy?).</p>

<dd>Nor is analytic philosophy properly a single movement, but rather a range of approaches to philosophical issues. The trouble is of course that there will be some exceptions to any proposed definition, which will be argued about until a bunch of weasel words are introduced, and then someone will edit those out, starting the cycle once again. <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanno_733d.html" title="User:Banno">Banno</a> 01:40, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>2. Thus the introduction is practically useless. The next section is called 'The term analytic philosophy'. This begins by saying that a.p. includes ' logical positivism, logical atomism and ordinary language philosophy'. Fine, but what are these fields? What actually is a.p.? Then, even worse, it says that few analytic philosophers adhere to any of these. Right. And that it would be a mistake to equate any of these to analytic p. Fine. As a reader who came to this article without any idea of what this subject is, I am now well and truly in the dark.</p>
<p>3. The section goes on to talk about the methods which characterise a.p., which is the closest the article gets to saying what it is. That's good, but why did I, the naïve reader, have to wait so long? However, this bit is far from correct, as it is much too wide. It gives necessary conditions, such as clarity and precision, emphasis on argumentation &amp;c, which characterise many philosophical schools apart from a.p. It does not mention the importance given by a.p. to formal methods of analysis (Russell's Theory of Descriptions as being a widely held paradigm for a.p., e.g.). The next two sentences (a.p. not being about 'meaning of life', and the stuff about focus and debate) are badly written, uncited and probably untrue.</p>
<p>4. The final part of this section says it began with Frege, Russell, Moore and Wittgenstein. This repeats the introduction, is not properly part of this section anyway, and moreover fails to say what these philosophers actually did. It says that a.p. includes 'all those who work in their vein'. Yes, but what was their vein? The gentle reader is still in the dark.</p>
<p>5. The next section is called 'Relation to continental philosophy'. This is awkwardly written. It says the distinction is 'problematic', which is a bad way of beginning a section about something, and it says that it contrasts a method against a region. Possibly, but the reader still hasn't the faintest idea about what the analytic method actually is, so how does this help? There is a short passage about the The European Society for Analytic Philosophy, but it is unclear why it is in the section.</p>
<p>6. The next section is called 'Formalism and natural languages'. This starts with the unhelpful claim that 'Part of analytic approach is the clarification of philosophical problems by examining the language used to express them'. Yes, but how do analytics think this helps? Any informative answer would have to mention the two conflicting view on this held by analytics, namely 1. Ordinary language is misleading disguises its logical form, and that philosophical propositions become meaningless or trivial once we attempt to reduce them to the correct logical form. 2. Ordinary language is not misleading, and the correct logical form of ordinary language is ordinary language. However, 'philosophical propositions' are not ordinary language because they contain ersatz metaphysical terminology – once this terminology is analysed using plain language, we find it is meaningless nonsense (e.g. Geach's remarks on 'Nothing noths' in 'Mental Acts').</p>
<p>7. The next sentence 'Two major threads weave through this tradition: formalism and natural language' is poorly written and, once again, fails to explain the issue, which is the two threads mentioned in (6) above (formalism = the belief that analysis should be reduction of ordinary language to logical form, natural language = the view that ordinary language is not misleading, but metaphysical language is. The next sentence attempts to clarify this by saying ' The former seeks to understand language, and hence philosophical problems, by making use of formal logic.'. Yes, but for goodness' sake how? It then says 'it seeks to formalize the way in which philosophical statements are made'. This does not explain why formalist analytic p's would do this, namely (as just explained above) to show that the problem disappears on reduction, because the p. statement either is shown to be trivial, or cannot be so reduced, thus meaningless.</p>
<p>8. The sentence that follows deserves quoting in full, because it is such <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLLOCKS_9aa6.html" title="WP:BOLLOCKS">WP:BOLLOCKS</a>.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This has led to a number of successes, including modern logic, recognizing the primary importance of sense and reference in the construction of meaning, Kurt Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem, Bertrand Russell's theory of definite descriptions, Karl Popper's theory of falsificationism and Alfred Tarski's Semantic Theory of Truth.</dd>
</dl>
<p>What? The statement that this (whatever this is, presumably the 'two threads' first mentioned) led to modern logic is either nonsense, or wrong. What is meant by 'modern logic'. If it means first order predicate calculus, most of the development of this took place very early on (Frege and Peirce gave us most of it), was complete by the 1920's, and in any case took place in parallel with anything else that happened in the Analytic tradition. The phrase 'recognizing the primary importance of sense and reference in the construction of meaning' is gobbledegook. What follows returns to the usual list-salad – things mentioned to show the erudition of the writer, without any context or explanation. The mention of the Theory of Descriptions is good, as it is the paradigm of the analytic method (said Ramsey). But, er, what actually is the Theory of Descriptions? And what is the Incompleteness Theorem, the theory of falsificationism (sic), the Semantic Theory of Truth. Obscurum per obscurius.</p>
<p>9. Then we have "The other thread seeks to understand philosophical ideas by a close and careful examination of the natural language used to express them – usually with some emphasis on the importance of common sense in dealing with difficult concepts." But why do OLP's do this? And the mention of common sense here seems to confuse earlier methods of philosophy (Reid, Berkeley) with the underlying principles of OLP. The statement that 'These two threads intertwine, sometimes implacably opposed to each other, sometimes virtually identical' was clearly intended as a masterpiece of prose, but quite out of place in an encyclopedia article. The statement 'Famously, Wittgenstein started out in the formalism camp, but ended up in the natural language camp.' is probably the only accurate statement in the article, but of course without clear and accurate statements of what "formalism camp" and "natural language camp" represent, it is completely meaningless.</p>
<p>10. The next section is called 'Formalism'. The first subsection is called 'Logical atomism'. It opens with the oft-repeated statement that analytic philosophy has its origins in Gottlob Frege’s development of predicate logic. This adds a little to the many statements that went before, but only a little. What is predicate logic? Does this not conflict with the earlier statement about 'modern logic' developing as a result of the analytic movement. It contains the blatantly false claim that 'This permitted a much wider range of sentences to be parsed into logical form.' This is debatable: some (e.g. Sommers, plural quantificationists) hold that predicate calculus in the form developed by Frege is more restrictive than the old traditional logic, other (e.g. Wittgenstein II) held that the logical form of ordinary language is ordinary language.</p>
<p>11. Next there is a potentially useful remark about Russell's use of predicate calculus to analyse the word 'is. But it is too far out of context to be useful</p>
<p>12. There is another allusion to the Theory of Descriptions in the sentence "Russell sought to resolve various philosophical issues by applying such clear and clean distinctions, most famously in the case of the Present King of France." Good God. We are nearly there, we have nearly arrived at the paradigm itself. But the term 'Theory of Descriptions' is missing. And how does 'the Present King of France' connect with anything at all?</p>
<p>13. The next subsection is called "The Tractatus". It correctly state that "As a young Austrian soldier, Ludwig Wittgenstein expanded and developed Russell's logical atomism into a comprehensive system in a brief book, the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus". Presumably the remark about 'Austrian soldier' is the work of the editor whose subtle hand may be detected throughout the article, and who covertly maintains that there is no such thing as 'continental philosophy' because it was really all the work of the Austrians and others. But only an insider will know that. And what, again, is 'logical atomism'? Then it continues with some summary doctrines of the Tractatus. Obscurum per obscurius again. The Tractatus is a famously opaque and difficult book. How does it help our grandmother, whose complete understanding of the basics of analytic philosophy should be the intended result of this article, to repeat the sybilline pronouncements of one of the most difficult books ever written? 'A picture of the world can be built up by expressing atomic facts in atomic propositions'. Indeed.</p>
<p>14. There follows a brief mention of the 'limits of my language mean the limits of my world'. Now this is really important. The philosophical doctrine which underlies all of Wittgenstein's philosophy, in all periods, is that the result of philosophy is not a number of 'philosophical propositions' [philosophische Sätze], but to make propositions clear. Philosophy should make clear and delimit sharply the thoughts which otherwise are, as it were, opaque and blurred. This is one of the central ideas of analytic philosophy, and is a manifesto of positivism. But it occurs too late, and might be confused with a brief subsection about the biography of one of its leading figures.</p>
<p>15. The sentence 'Wittgenstein thought he had set out the 'final solution' to all philosophical problems, and so went off to become a school teacher' is 1066-ish, and moreover conceals the importance of the section by disguising it as biography. (Actually, an insider will understand it is not really biography, as W's decision to do this is deeply connected with the 'limits of language' thing. But this will only be obvious to insiders, whereas the article should clearly explain analytic philosophy to outsiders and grandmothers.</p>
<p>16. "However, he later revisited the inadequacy of logical atomism, and further expanded the philosophy of language by his posthumous book Philosophical Investigations." Pure 1066.</p>
<p>17. The section "Natural language semantics" helpfully explains that "This section is a stub. You can help by expanding it." Indeed.</p>
<p>18. The section "Reaction against idealism" is another stub.</p>
<p>19. The section "Ordinary language philosophy" refers us to another article. (Main article: Ordinary language philosophy).</p>
<p>20. There is a brief mention of the Oxford school (list of philosophers), and contains the frightful sentence "Rather than viewing philosophical problems with respect to logic, ordinary language philosophy sets forth the notion of consideration with respect to the ordinary usage of the linguistic terms germane to such problems. " Word salad.</p>
<p>21. A bit of OR "While schools such as logical positivism focus on logical terms, supposed to be universal and separate from contingent factors (such as culture, language, historical conditions), ordinary language philosophy emphasizes the use of language by ordinary people. It may be argued, then, that ordinary language philosophy is of a more sociological grounding, as it essentially focuses on the use of language within social contexts."</p>
<p>22. The section entitled " Logical positivism and logical empiricism" is a list, and contains no verb anywhere in sight.</p>
<p>23. "Philosophy of mind and cognitive science" Stub.</p>
<p>24. The section "Ethics in analytic philosophy" is helpful in that it explains how and why the analytic tradition initially had little to say on the subject of ethics. This, relatively speaking, is the best section of the article, but that isn't really saying much.</p>
<p>25. "Political philosophy" is both listy and short.</p>
<p>26. "Analytical Marxism" is interesting, but I know nothing about the subject, so won't comment.</p>
<p>27. "Communitarianism", likewise. These final sections are generally better than anything that goes before, but you could hardly blame the average reader for not venturing this far. It was a pretty brave and intrepid expedition on my part, I felt, to get to the very end of this ignoble article about a noble and great tradition.</p>

<dd>I strongly agree with DBuckner's points. This article is more laundry list than coherent, and is riddled with bad writing and basic errors.

<dd>As to defining Analytic in a way other than the previous intro, it might not be easy. To quote from the Oxford Companion on this:
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The philosophical disagreements between, say, Logical Positivism and the later Wittgenstein, or the methodological divergences between, say, Frege and Ryle, make it hard to give ‘analytical philosophy’ clear sense or reference</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>One solution might be to follow the example on the Continental page where a list of various philosophical positions or areas within Continental are given. So for analytic it might look something like:
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>philosophy of science(disputable), ordinary language philosophy, descriptivism, logical positivism, philosophy of science, semantic realism, ontological relativity, transcendentalism (or "connective analysis"), phil of mind, etc..</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As to mention of the AP/CP "juxtaposition", it's amusing to see another editor is also busy trying to remove any mention that analytic differs from continental. Why the sudden change? Especially if there is evidence that the division has become more rather than less extreme over the past few years? Is analytic philosophy on wiki entering a denial stage? Does it not suit Anglophone politics or is it suddenly embarassed to find someone else was in the room all along? I ask these questions since your partner editor, who is also suddenly entering denial on this, could not give me any reasonable explanation (or neutral sources) and so I must turn to these less logical explanations. I would suggest you are in any case doing an injustice to analytic philosophy.</dd>

<p>I have built on Banno's excellent work on the intro. I moved some of his edits into a section on 'history'. I removed the section on Continental philosophy, for now.</p>
<p>The current intro stresses three main features of analytic philosophy. There should be three sections in the main article corresponding to these.</p>
<p>First, the view that there are no specifically philosophical propositions. This can lead to a discussion of positivism generally, and then the views of Russell and Wittgenstein.</p>
<p>Second, the idea of logical form. This is the place for Russell's theory of descriptions, Wittgenstein's and Ramsey's view of it as the 'paradigm of philosophy'. Something about the disagreements about what the correct logical form is (which is the real disagreement of analytic philosophy).</p>
<p>Third, the point that analytic philosophy somehow defines itself as opposed to 'continental' philosophy. The Internet Encyclopedia (which is a pretty good resource) mentions this. I am surprised that Lucas thinks people are claiming there is no distinction. Who said that? Not me. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../d/b/u/User%7EDbuckner_293e.html" title="User:Dbuckner">Dbuckner</a> (<a href="../../../d/b/u/User_talk%7EDbuckner_f3f8.html" title="User talk:Dbuckner">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dbuckner_0ef9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dbuckner">contribs</a>) 09:18, 3 February 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
<p>I removed the bit about "mistrust" because it is not in the reference. The IEP merely says the way of identifying analytic is by contrasting it to continental:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Consequently, it has always relied on contrasts with other approaches to philosophy—especially approaches to which it found itself fundamentally opposed—to help clarify its own nature. Initially, it was opposed to British Idealism, and then to "traditional philosophy" at large. Later, it found itself opposed both to classical Phenomenology (for example, Husserl) and its offspring, such as Existentialism (Sartre, Camus, and so forth) and also "Continental"’ or "Postmodern" philosophy</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm also looking at the final paragraph on "sweeping philosophical systems", was that job assigned by Locke, get your brush out! This is misworded. Anyway, how could you get less sweeping than "1. The world is the totality of facts." Or LP's semantic tables.</p>
<p>Yes I have noted a couple of editors attempt to deny this distinction and remove it. However, they seem to do it out of instinct and have no references to back up their claim. Others seem to think that it is just an accident and that conscious individuals were not involved. <span style="font-style:oblique">-- <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">Lucas</a> <a href="../../../l/u/c/User_talk%7ELucaas_1582.html" title="User talk:Lucaas">(Talk)</a></span> 22:51, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This looks suspicious, are you making a statement and now searching for, perhaps dubious, backup, tertiary sources, etc.?

I am certainly of the opinion that something needs to be said in the article on the relationship between analytical philosophy and continental philosophy. As Lucas points out, analytical philosophers (i.e. Russell, Moore) initially defined themselves by way of contrast with British idealism. Later on, the Vienna Circle and the analytical philosophers who were influenced by the Circle, tended to define themselves against both traditional metaphysics and against phenomenology as practiced by Husserl and later by Heidegger. Rudolf Carnap, for instance, liked to cite Heidegger's writings as examples of how philosophy should not be done, as did A.J. Ayer. Also, the fact that Heidegger had been a Nazi under the Third Reich helped to widen the gulf between analytical and continental philosophers. On the other hand there has long been tendencies within analytical philosophy which have sought a rapprochement with continental philosophy: Morton White long ago called for a "reunion in philosophy" between analytical philosophy and continental philosophy by way of a holistic pragmatism. Richard Rorty has likewise sought to bridge the gap between analytical philosophy and continental philosophy with a postmodern pragmatism. Some analytical philosophers have written more or less sympathetic studies of thinkers that are crucial in the continental tradition. For example, Arthur Danto's and Alexander Nehamas's studies of Nietzsche. Nevertheless, the gulf between analytical philosophy and continental philosophy persists and should be addressed in an article on analytical philosophy. JimFarm 12:49, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>By way of explanation, sections sometimes arise from the history of the development of a page, in such a way that the purpose of the section is not clear to new editors. The above was added after the article anglo-american philosophy was re-directed here, more or less as an explanation of that re-direction. Hence the first two paragraphs. The second also intentionally shows that analytic philosophy is grounded in the work of philosophers from the continent; but this fact should come out in a properly re-written history section. The last paragraphs are simply argument contra the assertion that analytic philosophy is exclusively Anglophone.

Well, perhaps this section was just included on the analytic page to deal with some of the issues raised in the discussion of anglo-american philosophy. But there was for a long time before that discussion, section 2 in the article, called "relation to continental philosophy". It contained a rather long discussion but many of the same points were raised. And perhaps it is indicative of the ongoing disputes in this area that it seems easier to remove it altogether. In any case, let me include what it used to say on this issue below, just to see if there may be some informative stuff getting lost (<span style="font-style:oblique">-- <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">Lucas</a> <a href="../../../l/u/c/User_talk%7ELucaas_1582.html" title="User talk:Lucaas">(Talk)</a></span> 03:18, 5 February 2007 (UTC)):</p>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">The term "analytic philosophy" in part denotes the fact that most of this philosophy traces its roots to the early 20th century movement of "logical analysis"; in part the term serves to distinguish "analytic" from other kinds of philosophy, especially "continental philosophy". The latter denotes mainly philosophy that has taken place on continental Europe after (and partially in response to or reaction against) Hegel. Analytic or Anglophone philosophy developed, in part, as a reaction against the strong influence of Hegel's obscure and neologistic way of writing.
<p>One term (analytic) conventionally indicates a method of philosophy, while the other (continental) indicates, rather, a geographical origin. The distinction is, for this reason, quite misleading. Analytic philosophy's founding fathers, Frege, Wittgenstein, Carnap, the Logical Positivists (the Vienna Circle), the Logical Empiricists (in Berlin), and the Polish logicians were all products of the continent of Europe. Much philosophy in Germany and Italy today, most of that in the Nordic Countries, and a great deal scattered over the rest of the continent and in Latin America, is likewise analytic. The European Society for Analytic Philosophy [1] holds continental-wide conventions every third year. Conversely, continental philosophy is pursued today perhaps by more people in English-speaking countries than anywhere else, if primarily in comparative literature or cultural studies departments.</p>
<p>Many now claim that the distinction is worthless: that the subject matter of continental philosophy is capable of being studied using the now-traditional tools of analytic philosophy. If this is true, the phrase "analytic philosophy" might be redundant, or maybe normative, as in "rigorous philosophy". The phrase "continental philosophy", like "Greek philosophy", would denote a certain historical period or series of schools in philosophy: German idealism, Marxism, psychoanalysis qua philosophy, existentialism, phenomenology, and post-structuralism.</p>
<p>The split between the two began early in the twentieth century. The logical positivists of the 1920s promoted a systematic rejection of metaphysics, and a generalised hostility to certain metaphysical concepts that they considered meaningless or ill-conceived: for example, God, the immaterial soul or universals such as "redness". This was at the same time that Martin Heidegger was dominating philosophy in Germany, and becoming influential in France, and his work became the object of frequent derision in English-speaking philosophy departments. It should be noted that Heidegger himself offered a vigorous rejection of metaphysics, but that his version of metaphysics differs radically from the analytics'.</p>
<p>Analytic philosophy, under one interpretation, failed by its own systematic lights to demonstrate the meaninglessness or fictitiousness of the concepts it attacked. At least, few analytic philosophers today would agree that they have anything like an exact and proven theory of which terms are meaningful and which meaningless. Contemporary analytic philosophy journals are — for good or ill — as rich in metaphysics as the work of any continental philosopher.</p>

<dd>Which is far, far too much. This is an article on analytic philosophy, not on the difference between analytic and continental philosophy.

<dd>The early work of Moore and Russell was not a critique of British Idealism. Moore was a follower of the school in his early work, and Russell credits Moore with making the break (in his My Philosophical Development). The long section just quoted by Lucas seems to be a mixture of arguable personal opinion and error: Heidegger hardly 'dominated' German philosophy in the 1920s (he was, according to Arendt, much discussed among students, but B&amp;T didn't appear until 1927), he was unknown in France, and effectively unknown in England. The sentence about Heidegger which follows is incomprehensible. <a href="../../../k/d/_/User%7EKD_Tries_Again_8f08.html" title="User:KD Tries Again">KD Tries Again</a> 19:59, 5 February 2007 (UTC)<a href="../../../k/d/_/User%7EKD_Tries_Again_8f08.html" title="User:KD Tries Again">KD</a></dd>

<dd>I disocciate myself from anything in the quote from the article I gave above. I was just reminding people that this matter is traditionally an important one for the analytic page and given plenty of space there. I agree with Banno, it should not try and cover the split in general or give a neutral bird's-eye on the split, but show how analytic "relates itself" to continental. It may need to say why Russell's critique of Hegel was not taken up on the continent and, yet, how unlike other periods in the history of philosophy, this did not block the progress of analytic in England. <span style="font-style:oblique">-- <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">Lucas</a> <a href="../../../l/u/c/User_talk%7ELucaas_1582.html" title="User talk:Lucaas">(Talk)</a></span> 02:04, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think it even needs to say that, as Hegelianism did not dominate continental philosophy in this period. Hegel was largely forgotten in France until Kojeve and Hyppolite resuscitated interest in the 1930s; and I think he was much less important in Germany than Kant. I am not sure that anything more than a sentence on Continental philosophy is needed here, with a link to that page. <a href="../../../k/d/_/User%7EKD_Tries_Again_8f08.html" title="User:KD Tries Again">KD Tries Again</a> 16:41, 6 February 2007 (UTC)<a href="../../../k/d/_/User%7EKD_Tries_Again_8f08.html" title="User:KD Tries Again">KD</a></dd>

<dd>It is different to say when Hegelianism fell from favor in a retrospective, since in that it looks like both England and the Continent had moved on from Hegelianism with the appearance of phenomenology on one side and the philosophy of "Logical Analysis" on the other. But it was not until the 40s and 50s that there were major changes in the curricula. Until then Hegel was a part of basic teaching on both sides. Kojeve and Hyppolite renewed interest in Hegel amongst some of the leading lights, more than they revived an ignored philosopher onto the basic curriculum. Heidegger had also included Hegel on time &amp; spirit in his major work.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The point I try to make is how a philosophy, eg, analytic, makes a critique of Hegel which is not well received on the Continent, yet this does not block its progress toward dominating the Anglo-scene. And vice-versa for Continental. In contrast, the interaction of Berkeley-Hume-Kant-Hegel affects both English and Continental philosophy and blocks or promotes philosophies accordingly. <span style="font-style:oblique">-- <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">Lucas</a> <a href="../../../l/u/c/User_talk%7ELucaas_1582.html" title="User talk:Lucaas">(Talk)</a></span> 15:45, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>1. Keep something about the way early analytic philosophy defined itself in part by a reaction to Hegelianism. This is not to be confused with the reaction to Heidegger that happened later.</p>
<p>2. Drop as far as possible the stuff about definition by method vs by geography. There is an interesting point there that 'continenal philosophy' is in some sense defined from the outside, by analytic philosophers (i.e. as stuff that is not analytic &amp; is in their eyes something distinctively European). But that is not for this article.</p>
<p>3. On the para that begins " Many now claim that the distinction is worthless" – there is truth in that, but it belongs elsewhere.</p>
<p>4. That para that begins "The split between the two began early in the twentieth century" has no clear thread, so drop (unless someone can summarise in a sentence what it is trying to say, then rewrite it so it reflects that summary).</p>
<p>5. The para that begins "Analytic philosophy, under one interpretation" is blatant OR. Drop.</p>

<dd>Inspired by all of this I read the first 40 pages or so of Being and Time (in the now infamous Macquarrie &amp; Robinson translation) last night. Then I reached the bit where he says that Appearance is what <i>doesn't</i> show itself. He justifies this by an analogy: a disease, the actual disease, is hidden from us. It appears only through its symptoms. Thus what appears (the disease) is hidden from us. This seems about as far from Wittgenstein (as least, the later W) as you can get.</dd>

<dd>I thought some more about the geography issue. Perhaps there is a case for connecting culture with certain ways of doing philosophy. Peirce actually argues this <a href="http://www.ukzn.ac.za/undphil/collier/308/Peirce/Fraser-Review-Peirce.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.ukzn.ac.za/undphil/collier/308/Peirce/Fraser-Review-Peirce.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> (search for the paragraph beginning "From very early times, …"). He claims that the English national character 1. Is unsystematic (e.g. legal system), 2. resists any theoretical complication as long as there is the least possibility that the facts can be explained in a simpler way, 3. rejects any conception which cannot be made perfectly definite and easily intelligible. <a href="../../../d/b/u/User%7EDbuckner_293e.html" title="User:Dbuckner">Dbuckner</a> 08:57, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well I take back all I've said about you (if it was ever ad-hominem) and thank you for the references. I agree with the spirit of this since one way to confusion about the issue is to talk of geography only in relation to Continental, and talk of analytic only in terms of method. Both phenomenology and analytic began as new methods of philosophy. And at this stage both methods have developed to the extent that Continental and Analytic are really just designators or names. And the geographic counterpart for analytic is Anglophone or Anglo-American.</dd>
<dd>The idea that the English are not systematic, is not in "character" (just look at Tristram Shandy, Newton or Darwin), it comes from political conservatism and the fact that the spirit of the French revolution never reached England in the form it did via Napoleon on the Continent. Though remember Hegelianism, the great systematic philosophy was dominant in England for almost a century and the early system breakers were Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, both philosophers on the continental. Analytic is also very systematic in its Logical Positivist mode, in contrast to Heideggerean poeticising mode of philosophy.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The scandal of philosophy for Heidegger was that so many philosophers had beaten themselves up over trying to prove the existence of the external world. For Heidegger it is there before you even try to talk about it, his starting point is not the subject which then goes on to try and prove the outside world, but the "subject in the world". This sentiment I think Wittgenstein would have agreed with. <span style="font-style:oblique">-- <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">Lucas</a> <a href="../../../l/u/c/User_talk%7ELucaas_1582.html" title="User talk:Lucaas">(Talk)</a></span> 17:30, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

  The period 1916-27 constitutes the spell of creative silence in Heidegger's development.
  Many aspects of this period remain unclear, but the main lines of personal experience
  and intellectual contact can be traced. Heidegger works with <a href="../../../h/u/s/Husserl.html" title="Husserl">Husserl</a>,
  whom he will succeed at Freiburg in 1928, and masters the mental discipline and vocabulary
  of <a href="../../../p/h/e/Phenomenology.html" title="Phenomenology">phenomenology</a>, of the search for a firm basis for perception and cognition in acts
  of pure consciousness. <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Barth_b89d.html" title="Karl Barth">Karl Barth</a>'s commentary on <i>The Epistle to the Romans</i> appears
  in 1918. It influences Heidegger's whole style of textual exposition, of word-by-word
  interpretation, and directs his attention to the radical, psychologizing theology of
  <a href="../../../k/i/e/Kierkegaard.html" title="Kierkegaard">Kierkegaard</a>. This theological interest, from 1923 on, brings Heidegger into close exchange
  with Bultmann, and forms the basis for a persistent mutual awareness between Heideggerian
  ontology and the modern "theology of crisis" and de-mythologization.

<dd>Third, a rejection of sweeping philosophical systems in favour of close attention to detail.[4] Among some (but by no means all) analytic philosophers, this rejection of "grand theory" has taken the form of a defence of common sense and ordinary language against the pretensions of metaphysicians</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<p>The source is given as: ^ See, e.g., the works of G.E. Moore and J.L. Austin. Now I could equally add "see the founding document of analytic, the Tractatus". The opening statement of which is?
