<h2><span class="mw-headline">New proposed disambiguation scheme</span></h2>
<p>I'm reverting the changes Kev made to the new disambiguation I introduced (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anarchism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=11980862" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anarchism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=11980862" rel="nofollow">this difference</a>). Kev explains "The disambugation being put forth by capitalists is skewed" -- actually, my disambiguation, which describes (this kind of) anarchism specifically by its historical roots, is clearer than Kev's replacement (which is redundant with the beginning of the text, to boot): "This page refers to anarchism as a philosophy of those who seek out and identify structures of authority, hierarchy, and domination, and challenge them, to increase the scope of human freedom". Some anarcho-capitalists would read that and think you were talking about their philosophy. Some anti-libertarians would read that and take serious issue with your concept of freedom. Kev then removes all reference to anarcho-capitalism (which was already very terse and way at the end) from the article text. This is unnecessary -- it wasn't exactly occupying prime real estate before -- and having it in will serve to avoid occasional confusion. Third, Kev changed the disambiguation from <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Anarchism (disambiguation)">anarchism (disambiguation)</a> to <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchy.html" title="Anarchy">anarchy</a>, a page which is inadequate to the job. He thinks that <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Anarchism (disambiguation)">anarchism (disambiguation)</a> is biased ... see <a href="../../../a/n/a/Talk%7EAnarchism_%28disambiguation%29_813e.html" title="Talk:Anarchism (disambiguation)">Talk:Anarchism (disambiguation)</a>. - <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Kraus</a><a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">e</a> 06:04, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The disambiguation page <b>is</b> skewed. The changes that were made are skewed. I believe Kev is correct in his treatment of the page, if you're going to use disambiguation to introduce ancaps, then they shouldn't be mentioned at all. If they are mentioned, they don't need a disambiguation.

<dd>When I see a reference to "increase the scope of human freedom", the <i>last</i> thing I think about is socialism. Such a "disambiguation" doesn't do a good job of disambiguating. Furthermore, linking it to <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchy.html" title="Anarchy">anarchy</a> makes no sense on those grounds -- the latter page doesn't even have a link to <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalism</a>, because when I tried to add one a while back it got reverted by one of the socialists around here who are working tirelessly to expunge all references to AC from all the pages related to anarchism and anarchy. The new disambig page needs a lot of work, but it still makes more sense as a link destination. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan*</a> 12:26, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Geez, it is a larff to hear any <i>anarchist</i> describe <i>someone else</i> as fringe. Dan is right about the disambiguation. Plus, it is currently redundant: just mentioning some of the principles of the movement is quite sufficient, the rest is just puffery. The fact that we have a (not-so-NPOV) definition for this article does not mean we can't mention anything that falls outside of the definition, especially if, as in this case, just about the only thing we say about it is that it falls outside the definition. I mean, the definition of "anarcho-capitalism" is quite clear, and yet that article mentions socialist anarchism several times. These pages are controlled by ansoc POV warriors. - <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Kraus</a><a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">e</a> 13:10, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It would help a lot if while describing the POV warrior opposition you didn't use terms like ansoc, which tag you to a pretty narrow field of POV warrioring yourself Nat. You and Dtobias (now Dan) have your own axes to grind, and your talk of socialists working tirelessly to "expunge all referances to AC from all the pages related to anarchism" would get a lot more traction if A) it was true (it isn't, almost all the editors of anarchism pages have allowed brief referances to anarcho-capitalism to exist) and B) you didn't appear to be doing the exact same thing in the opposite direction (that is, working tirelessly as capitalists to bias these articles toward a particularly AC perspective on the history and modern state of anarchism). <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 18:09, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Anarcho-capitalism is not part of anarchist thought. Why do vandalising Anarchi-capitalists such as <i>Nat</i> want to put it in there?

<dd>Hey, check this out, I, too, can make irrelevant blanket assertions: anarcho-capitalism <i>is</i> part of anarchist thought. See? Look how sensible it all is. However, the above discussion centers on a disambiguation, thus, it is not trying to settle the issue of whether or not what is a part of which. Your comment sounds a little out of place, and your citations of philosophy references are irrelevant. We are trying to make a <i>better</i> source of information, containing more facts, than the other options. Your insistence that Wikipedia conform to your POV is counterproductive. - <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Kraus</a><a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">e</a> 14:10, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't see the necessity of this extra page at all, or the unbelievable amount of attention it gets at the top of the article. Just because a few people call themselves anarchists and no one else on earth agrees with them, they get their name on a page? OK, to be fair we should include "anarcho" monarchists because there actually is a guy out there that made a site about it. It's true that he's the only person on earth that came up with this, but who cares?! Anyone can use the word anarchism! Why not make a separate page for the fashion "anarchists" whose ideology is based solely on buying red copyrighted "anarchy" signs from corporate chain stores?? Surely they must be mentioned! All joking aside, it is a lapse in judgement to do this and I very highly recommend that we ditch this, because it's once again giving into the demands of idiots who know nothing at all about anarchism and want to say "me too!" and it gives wayyy too much attention to a use of the word anarchism which is not only false but extremely rare and only spoken in conversation by those who know nothing about anarchism. <b>SERIOUSLY, LET'S LOSE THIS.</b> --<a href="../../../f/a/t/User%7EFatal_5ada.html" title="User:Fatal">Fatal</a> 22:49, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Kev removes the only mention of AC in the article text, writing: "Nat, we've been over this, you can't -both- decide to disambugate this page AND talk about anarcho-capitalism as a form of anarchism in it". The complete text in question is this:</p>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> is a philosophy which is sometimes referred to as a form of anarchism because it opposes the state. However, this article concerns the term "anarchism" in the sense of a socialist movement, and anarcho-capitalism does not fall under this rubric.</dd>

<p>Since these two sentences, appearing at the end of the article, explicitly state that anarcho-capitalism falls outside of this definition, I fail to understand the logic of the objection. - <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Kraus</a><a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">e</a> 07:53, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The logic goes like this. The second indicating that anarcho-capitalism was not considered in this article was already there. Then you decided that the entire page needed to be given a little warning about how this is not the only use of the term. Fine and good, it also makes the anarcho-capitalism bit redundant. So we removed it, now you insist not only on over emphasizing anarcho-capitalism by declaring this page to be one of oh so many possible uses right at the begining, but then you want to double up the emphasis by explicitly mentioning anarcho-capitalism in an article you just ruled it out from.

<dd>The original article had become too POV to double as a disambiguation page, and creating an "Anarchism (disambiguation)" page is obviously clumsy. While I freely express my opinions on the talk pages, I strive for NPOV usually through a non-deletionist approach to balance in the article proper. This new disambiguation page is NPOV. Note, that although I mock the coercive branch of anarchism with the names above (which also have a kernel of truth), in good faith, I chose the qualifying subtitle that this other POV self-identifies with, "anti-capitalism".

<p>This is not an NPOV issue. Lots of pages about lots of controversial subjects do not disambuagate the main page just because there is some minor sub-movement trying to subvert the use of the word. Yes, anarcho-capitalism should be noted as significant somewhere on the page, or the page should itself indicate that it is not based on their use of the word.

<p>Hi, I've never really been involved with this article before. I've just had a look, and I can see that so-called "anarcho-capitalism" has been included in the list of anarchist schools of thought. People who call themselves "anarcho-capitalists" are not in any anarchist school of thought, and so there are only two solutions: that the "anarcho-capitalist" section be deleted (and covered in a separate article) or that we change the section title to something like "Schools of thought that use the term 'anarchism'".</p>
<p>The first solution is ideal, but if there is a consensus on this page to include the section, then the second solution must be applied. There are no other options.</p>

<dd>I agree it is not a school of anarchism - but we can't have ersatz schools of thought (whether they wanna call themselves anarchist or not) mixed in with the widely identified and accepted strands of Anarchism (by both academics, anarchists themselves). There is plenty of prior discussion on all this - consult the archives above. I feel that the best way is to include Anarcho-capitalism on the disambiguation page - but have that accessible from the main Anarchism article.

<p>Make up your minds. Will we disambiguate anarchism or not? This article definitely should use the definition of anarchism as established by its founding figures either way, but if we disambiguate, there is no mention of ancapism at all on it except in the disambig blurb at the top and a link at the bottom, if we don't, then ancapism would be placed in a section at the end explaining the hostile relationship between the two and linking to the main ancap article. The option of including it in "schools of anarchism" is one that flies in the face of historical evidence of course, and one that would require ignoring the definition of anarchism that anarchists themselves hold.--<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChe_y_Marijuana_56bf.html" title="User:Che y Marijuana"></a> <small><small><small><a href="http://www.revolutionaryleft.com" class="external text" title="http://www.revolutionaryleft.com" rel="nofollow">Revolutionary Left</a></small></small></small> | <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChe_y_Marijuana_56bf.html" title="User:Che y Marijuana">Che y Marijuana</a> 17:28, Apr 9, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This page has become too duplicative of the the communism page. The communists are trying to steal the heritage of the individualists. There is no evidence that Aristippus, Stirner and many of the others would be any more likely to give up their sovereignty to a commune than they would to the state. The commune is just a mini-fascist state where the collective takes precedence over the individual. The individual has mass and the commune doesn't. The commune is just a massless, quasi-Christian, concept, only believed in by the faithfull. No way Stirner would kiss commune ass. A "gift economy", what a joke, communes were just mini-countries claiming their real-estate, another fascist state, creating an us vs them hierarchy.

<dd>Be happy to dig up a quote for you. But before I do I would like to ask one very simple question. Have you ever actually read Stirner? I find it very hard to believe that you could have read him and still be unaware of his complete rejection of property. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 09:17, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I read him long ago, before he gained popularity. I viewed his work as an intellectual and rhetorically mocking reductio ad absurdem of any result of Hegelian criticism short of nihilism, showing that it like Cartesian criticism resulted in nihilism. Of course, he would give property no "respect" beyond what circumstances would require. My reading is that his criticism shed more light upon Hegelian criticism, and was aimed more at those Hegelians who either hypocritically or through faith or self-delusion, thought they had constructed something that could survive the criticism. I didn't think he communicated any insight into the workings of capitalism or any other non-Hegelianism. But if you think he has, I am curious.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 10:33, Apr 10, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wait, you are saying that his rejection of property was merely a rhetorical device used to mock Hegelians? I mean, he wasn't actually suggesting any of that stuff? That reading is rather unique, sorta makes it hard to provide evidence. If I give a statement in which he dismisses or denounces property, you can simply say it is a reductio ad absurdum, right? So... how am I supposed to provide evidence here?</dd>

<dd>I was hoping for something on Capitalism. On property, will you accept evidence that he didn't go around stealing as evidence he didn't actually believe it? I don't think he actually believed anything, other than what he chose to of empirical reality. He basically arrived at the same position all nihilists do, he just showed that Hegelian tradition did not have anything more to offer. But if you think at some point he offered a uniquely insightful criticism of capitalism, I'd like to hear it.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 11:06, Apr 10, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would think that a rejection of property would entail a rejection of capitalism, don't you think? Anyway, I certainly wouldn't say that it is evidence that one accepts property on an philosophical level simply because one is not a thief. I do not steal property even though I find the concept to be untenable, in part because my reasons for not stealing have little or nothing to do with the normative justifications for property relations. Anyway, again, I will supply the evidence I have indicated (that he rejected property), once you agree that afterwards you will supply evidence that this somehow does not entail a rejection of capitalism (either because he didn't actually reject property, or his rejection of property would not entail a rejection of capitalism, or whatever). Simply saying, "well yes, he was much like a nihilist in many ways, that doesn't mean he specifically rejected capitalism" is silly, because it assumes your point at the outset and seems somewhat insincere in the face of evidence that he rejected an institution absolutely and undeniably essential to capitalism. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 11:23, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you misunderstand nihilism. Just because a nihilist realizes that in the broad scheme of things a human is no better or worse, or beautiful or ugly, or valuable or worthless than a chimpanzee or and insect, just because he realizes that, doesn't mean that this view affects his mating preference. A nihilist still has preferences, even though he doesn't have illusions. He still values, even though he has no values. Stirner mated and lived with a human female, and the evidence indicated that he liked it (the dedication to one of his books). He had property, and did what he wanted with it, because he could. I suspect that he didn't reject property, he just rejected any illusions about it, having it didn't make him any better than anyone else, the fact that other people thought it belonged to him just gave him more choices, and he did not acknowledge any prohibitions on his choosing what he willed. I may be projecting myself onto him, but I think he can be read this way.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 11:54, Apr 10, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thats all fine and good. But first, this seems to be a non-normative reading of Stirner, and I don't see why I should accept it as compelling. And second, you seem to be implicitly admitting that the evidence I'm asking for doesn't exist. Basically, your position reduces in such a way that regardless of how many quotes or passages I can come up with to show that Stirner rejected property, you can always say "well he used property, so obviously he didn't." Its a circular bit of logic without any foundation, and could as easily be applied to every anarchist thinker in existence, "sure, Proudhon rejected property as coercive, but he still used it," "yes, Kropotkin advocated a society without property, but he still used it," etc, etc. I think you are confusing the fact that these individuals were all trapped in a highly coercive and codified society with their having someone tacitly consented to it. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 20:28, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Do Kropotkin and Proudhon claim to be nihilists? If not then that is probably the difference. For Stirner, there is no moral imperative other than perhaps a bit of outrage or derision towards those who think there is a moral imperative. Whereas, perhaps for Kropotkin and Proudhon, labeling something coercive or exploitive, gives them a sense of entitlment to outrage and action, rather like fundamentalists in the true faith. Any means, including the use of property, could be justified to achieve their ends, they are self-reighteous. As a nihilist, Stirner could never be a self-reighteous true believer, at most he could "pretend" and enjoy for awhile. If he associated with true-believers, he would merely be expressing a preference, and be trying to pass. None of this rules out Stirner having made some kind of incisive analytic point on the issues at hand, as a nihilist, he was ahead of his time. Proudhon and Kropotkin would be self-justifying hypocrits if they used property. Stirner could not be a hypocrit unless he started deceiving himself.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 00:22, Apr 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So more fundamentally, you seem to be saying that Stirner not only did not "really" reject property, but that he did not "really" believe even in egoistic freedom. Now, while we may agree that he didn't believe in such "freedom to" as an absolute universal, I think it is wrong to then conclude that he did not advocate individual freedom at all, or that when he did he was merely "pretending". But now we are on a tangent of a tangent, none of this remotely relates to the article, and again I have to remind you that the purpose of this talk page is not a discussion forum. If you are looking for evidence that Stirner decried capitalism "more fervently" then collectivism, then I can't offer it, because I've never claimed to have it. But you already seem to know that he did in fact decry property and thus capitalism, you simply seem to think that even though he denounced property he must not have "really" denounced it because as an egoist you can't "really" denounce anything. And again, this leaves you nowhere. You want to say that Stiner would not have endorsed collectivist pressures on his sovereignty, well of course you are correct, I don't see anyone claiming otherwise. What leaves your statement meaningless is that you are attempting an implicit comparison to capitalism that doesn't exist. Stirner would also not have endorsed propertarian pressures on his sovereignty. Do you actually deny this? If not, right back to the start, you don't seem to be saying anything that isn't already on the table. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 00:58, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Egoistic freedom is not a belief, it is a feeling that one has after escaping all the positive -isms. He didn't acknowledge anyone's right to infringe upon his freedom. This does relate to the the article because Stirner is cited as a precursor to this positive anarchism that in addition to being without government, somehow posits the elimination of inequality. We have strange situation of "anarchists" claiming their own unanswered refutation as a pre-cursor. Anarcho-capitalism does not have the same problem, because it is not a positive -ism, but a spontaneous order that occurs under conditions of voluntary exchange. They would seem to have the stronger case for non-coercion, and to be the less self-justified in the use of violence to get there. Both will have problems explaining how any sizable society would work without government, but at least anarcho-capitalism can be approached as a perhaps unrealizable asymptope through minarchism, with pauses along the way. Equality that focuses upon the material is just an illusion anyway, after all, who wouldn't trade a little material wealth and power for increased sexual frequency, as the French seem to have done.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 01:45, Apr 11, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Will I ever meet a capitalist who can refrain from resorting to straw-men? Ceasing to enforce artificial hierarchies brought about by way of coercion is very different from positing the elimination of inequality. It is, rather, an attempt to elminate those inequalities which are unjustified and unnecessary, something anarcho-capitalists do as well in regards to government sponsorship of citizens and corporations.</dd>

<dd>Further, your characterization of anarcho-capitalism as "spontaneous order" is a joke. It is only "spontaneous" after you accept the blatant coercion of property, something Stirner also recognised. Again and again, you ignore the fact that Stirner rejected property as somehow irrelevant to a questions that hinges on the fact. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 00:57, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wow, how I can I argue against elimination of the inequalities which are "unjustified" and "unnecessary"? What can be more of a strawman than labeling all employment of wage labor, "exploitation" and all property "coercion"? The labored explanation and persuasion you have to resort to, to get others to recognize these strawmen is further proof of their illegitimacy. The "coercion" of property is so "blatant", that you have to explain how it exists even without the use of force, as you propose a society where people will have no security in their homes, something even most slaves have enjoyed thoughout history.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 04:45, Apr 12, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Fact, POV, and acceptable verbiage</span></h2>
<p>Fact: The traditional "anarchist" movement that overwhelmingly claims the title is an anti-capitalist movement separate from anarcho-capitalism. Anarcho-capitalist POV: Anarcho-capitalism is anarchist. "Traditional" anarchist POV: Anarcho-capitalism is not anarchist.</p>
<p>Those are the facts and those are the points of view presented. In order to preserve NPOV, Wikipedia must not pass judgment on whether anarcho-capitalism is anarchist. In order to preserve factuality, Wikipedia must make the factual distinction I noted above. In the latest versions of the articles <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalism</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a> this is the case. Since "anarchist" is the best (only) term to describe the anti-capitalist anarchists ("left-anarchist" would be a neologism and Wikipedia can't make up neologisms), I now have no problem with leaving "anarchism" as it is and disambiguating. Similarly, <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarianism.html" title="Libertarianism">libertarianism</a> disambiguates between the originally and predominantly American ideology of "libertarianism" and libertarian socialism. I offer this as a resolution to the POV dispute of the past few days.</p>

<p>"This page describes the traditional ideology of anarchism that opposes the state, capitalism and other forms of what it deems imposed hierarchy. For less common uses, see anarchism (disambiguation)." I approve this disambiguation. It's on the right side of the <i>factual</i> distinction (anarcho-capitalism is separate from the most traditional and common sense of the term "anarchism") as well as not outright stating the leftist POV that anarcho-capitalism is not anarchist. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Philwelch</a> 01:02, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>From the invention of "anarchism" in the 17th century, the word has almost always been employed as a pejorative. As a political theory, it has usually been befriended by a tiny minority of political cranks. It has, however, been popular with some libertarians.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Many, if not most, libertarians believe that it is always wrong to initiate the use of force. This leads them toward anarchism: after all, how can you have a government that does not initiate force, if only to collect taxes to finance its activities and to enforce its claim to exclusive jurisdiction? Some who advocate the non-initiation imperative, such as Ayn Rand, have tried to fudge the issue, by concocting arguments to the effect that government coercion is somehow not coercive or that government can somehow exist without coercion. But many who advocate the non-initiation imperative, most notably Murray Rothbard, have surrendered to the ineluctable logic that leads to anarchism.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that it's assumed by the author that anarchism means the absence of government without any of the anti-capitalist baggage, and that "traditional" leftist anarchism is not mentioned at all unless it's what's being referred to as "a tiny minority of political cranks". Anarchism is here contrasted with <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minarchism.html" title="Minarchism">minarchism</a>, the advocacy of a small, limited government. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan*</a> 15:03, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

Plato believed that the corruption created by democracy loosens the "natural" hierarchy between social classes, genders and age groups, to the extent that "anarchy finds a way into the private houses, and ends by getting among the animals and infecting them". ('Republic', book 8). Aristotle spoke of it in book 6 of the 'Politics' when discussing revolutions, saying that the upper classes may be motivated to stage a coup by their contempt for the prevailing "disorder and anarchy (ataxias kai anarkhias)" in the affairs of the state. He also claimed it would give, "license among slaves (anarkhia te doulôn)" as well as among women and children. "A constitution of this sort", he concludes, "will have a large number of supporters, as disorderly living (zên ataktôs) is pleasanter to the masses than sober living".</i> So Anarchism was invented in the 17th century?

<dd>Are you making some kind of point when grouping anarcho-capitalists with libertarians on the right? Where would you have them, with the totalitarians of the left? The unnaturalness of equality implies coercion.

<dd>Sounds like that book basically adopts the same approach some of us are trying to bring to this article here... to include AC as one of the things covered in the anarchism chapter, using language such as "most anarchists" (instead of "all anarchists") to discuss what anarchism usually (but not always) stands for and how this is different from the ideals of AC, and also note the connection between AC and the libertarian movement. Note that the book doesn't say that anarchists <b>are</b> socialists, just that <b>most</b> of them share similar ideals to socialists. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan*</a> 22:36, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So long as this article isn't disambuagated I think anarcho-capitalism should be mentioned. However, language that indicates that anarchism "usually" stands for something different than AC simply puts the ball in the AC court. Anarcho-capitalists want anarchism to mean something other than what it does, and what it has, and I don't think wikipedia should be a vehicle for their blatant soapboxing. Also, there have been many recent attempts to disambuagate the article, and while I have nothing wrong with the idea of clarifying different meanings of the word (because there are in fact different meanings), there is something wrong with the repeated attempts to both disambuagate this article from anarcho-capitalism -and- include anarcho-capitalism in it. Also, and this is rather important, the fact that not every source on earth states that all anarchists are socialists is one thing, but it certainly doesn't imply that anarchists can be capitalists. For many people, post-left anarchists in particular, a rejection of socialism is not an embrace of capitalism, and the constant attempts on the part of capitalists to create a false either/or in this case only serves to reduce the level of conversation by outright removing concepts that disagree with their worldview. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 23:03, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It should be mentioned in the intro or header that this kind of anarchism is also sometimes called "left anarchism". That's a popular term so it should be there. It comes up 3290 times on Googole.

<p>3200 is not enough. I did not create that page, I made it link here because someone tried to move this page there. Left-anarchism is not a widespread term, and has no basis in daily political discourse, either in the general public, or in the anarchist movement. Those results also include phrases like "post-left anarchism", which is not a mention of "left-anarchism" and is a strain of thought that argues that anarchists must break away from the traditional left, who in their views have become corrupted enough that they will never end capitalism or statism, such as the union bureaucrats and the like whose entire existance rests on this system.--<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChe_y_Marijuana_56bf.html" title="User:Che y Marijuana"></a> <small><small><small><a href="http://www.revolutionaryleft.com" class="external text" title="http://www.revolutionaryleft.com" rel="nofollow">Revolutionary Left</a></small></small></small> | <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChe_y_Marijuana_56bf.html" title="User:Che y Marijuana">Che y Marijuana</a> 02:43, Apr 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>

"Left anarchism" minus "post-left" comes up 3290 times ("left anarchism" -"post-left"). It's a common terminology. By the way, "post-left anarchism" only comes up 166 times.

<dd>The term "post-left anarchism" does carry a logical implication that there was a "left anarchism" to precede it, just like the term "postmodernism" (e.g., describing artistic or cultural trends and movements) implies the existence of "modernism" before it. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan*</a> 02:54, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It is not post <b>left-anarchism</b>, it is <b>post-left</b> anarchism. It is not something that comes after left-anarchism, but a form of anarchism that comes after "the left", which as I said, they see as too stodgy and corrupted to change anything. "Post-left" comes up 20,000 times. Anyways, you are inventing a term here on wikipedia and setting a bad precedent. Or at least, you are mainstreaming a term that is rarely used. "Left-anarchism" implies that there is a wide enough dispute within anarchism about the anarchism described on this page for this one to be the "left of anarchism". Anarchism is not, and never has been, divided in that way. Even if you do try to consider ancaps anarchists, which would be false, they are so minute that they would have to be called the "right of anarchism", and anarchism would remain without any qualifiers, left or right.--<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChe_y_Marijuana_56bf.html" title="User:Che y Marijuana"></a> <small><small><small><a href="http://www.revolutionaryleft.com" class="external text" title="http://www.revolutionaryleft.com" rel="nofollow">Revolutionary Left</a></small></small></small> | <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChe_y_Marijuana_56bf.html" title="User:Che y Marijuana">Che y Marijuana</a> 03:20, Apr 11, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I really don't understand this post-left thing. As far as I can tell, anarchists have always been post-left, by the above definition -- never reformists, always radicals. People can arrive at being radical many ways, by either being radical ("impatient") to begin with or getting fed up with the reformist path ("becoming impatient"). You might as well distinguish between <b>radical</b> anarchism and <b>revolutionary</b> anarchism (by that I mean let's <b>NOT!!</b>). If we somehow end up defining more branches of anarchism than there are branches of Marxism (Trotskyism, Leninism, Stalinism, Maoism, Uncle Ho-ism, Fidelism, SWP, RCP, CPUSA, ISO, etc.) then we will know for sure that we've gone too far. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbamuth_eea6.html" title="User:Albamuth">albamuth</a> 16:38, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A while ago I attempted to shorten the section on Economics by moving it all to an "Anarchist Economics" section, but since then the "Anarchist Economic Organization" has ballooned up again with some new and some redundant information. It seems every attempt to move out sections is reversed by people trying to fit too much info in what is supposed to be a brief description with a link to the "Main Article".</dd>
<dd>As far as criticism goes, I think making a seperate article, "Anarchism and its Critics" or "Critiques of Anarchism" would be appropriate. We really need to shorten the article up overall as well. Every "School" of anarchism has its own article or should so 3 or 4 sentences for each in the main article should be sufficient. The "Conflicts within Anarchist Thought" should be moved to a seperate article.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Idea of Schools Of Anarchism</span></h2>
<p>Okay, I've been thinking about this for a while: The thing that differentiates anarcho-syndicalists and anarcho-communists is <i>not a matter of ideological distinction</i>. The difference is only in <i>how</i> they pursue the overall anarchist goals (destruction of Capitalism and the State). I think this is an important distinction to made when discussing the Schools of Anarchism section, because currently people are getting the false idea that anarchists believe in wildly different things, which is not true. Syndicalists pursue their goals by trying to forge strong labor unions which will "take over" the means of production, whilest A-Communists form collectives and communes (creating means of production/living independatly of pre-existing ones). Primitivists attack civilization itself in order to bring down Capitalism/the State, anarcha-feminists concentrate their efforts on Patriarchy--so on and so forth. <b>My Proposal</b> is that the Schools section be re-framed/re-introduced to reflect the fact that these groupings are not ideologically different, but simply differentiate the <b>tactics</b> of anarchists. In fact, it is quite possible for someone to be anarcha-feminist-syndicalist-communist, which totally blows the whole "Schools" idea out of the water. (PS this does not mean Anarcho-Capitalism should be included, in fact, even less so) --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbamuth_eea6.html" title="User:Albamuth">albamuth</a> 16:48, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agreed. Anarcho-syndicalism to me actually doesn't have much of a syndicalist approach to an anarchist society, rather, the syndicalism part is just a means of getting there. The reason every anarchist union is called anarcho-syndicalist is because if they're forming a union they must believe radical unions are the best means of fighting capitalism. --<a href="../../../f/a/t/User%7EFatal_5ada.html" title="User:Fatal">Fatal</a> 03:34, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just a small point about all legitimate anarchists supposedly being leftwing: as an example of a study of rightwing anarchism, <i>Anarchy, State, and Utopia</i> — a famous and influential book by <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Nozick_b761.html" title="Robert Nozick">Robert Nozick</a> — examines the idea of a minimal, anarcho-capitalist state, though the overall thrust of the book is libertarian, not anarchist. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 06:47, Apr 12, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Nothing surprising there, Nozick's book came into waters long since muddied by Rothbard and others who claimed the anarchist tradition while going out of their way to minimize or flat out dismiss all of the essential ideas of the tradition they were claiming. That Nozick makes a mistake in accepting the anarcho-capitalist attempt to redefine anarchism is not evidence, in itself, to any legitimacy of claims on their part. Evidence of legitimacy to anarcho-capitalist claims of tradition within anarchism would be evidence that the individualist anarchists who supposedly "inspired" anarcho-capitalists would have remotely accepted capitalist ideology as a genuine branch of the free-market anarchism individualists had developed. The only problem with this is that anyone who has ever read an individualist knows that they all denounced capitalism, usually quite explicitly. Thus we get the never-ending attempts to explain how one could, in theory, have capitalism without property, or capitalism without wage and rent, or how when so-and-so said "socialism" he meant something different than what modern anarchists means, or when so-and-so said "capitalism" he meant something different than what modern anarcho-capitalists mean, or how such-and-such single line out of a single essay should be read in isolation from the rest of the texts of the author because doing so just might put capitalism in a not-so-negative light if we squint our eyes really hard. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 14:40, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Kev, as usual, assumes the answer before he begins. Nozick's use of "anarchism" isn't relevant because, well, he's not using it the way anarchists use it. Well, we already know he's not talking about anarchism in the sense that you use it. But, what we have here is an excellent example of the word "anarchism" being used in a different sense in a high-profile book by an author who is taken seriously in mainstream academe (although the author is not the libertarian most worthy of acclaim, we'll take what we can get). Nozick's readership, to my knowledge, did not react with confusion or derision at his "mistake", and I would be surprised to learn that anyone had ever suggested he change the title to <i>Statelessness, the State, and Utopia</i>, or something like that.

<p>It's interesting that this article mentions individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker. "Anarchism is a word without meaning, unless it includes the liberty of the individual to control his product or whatever his product has brought him through exchange in a free market --that is, private property. Whoever denies private property is of necessity an Archist." -Benjamin Tucker</p>

<dd>I wrong to say that before. She's an individualist anarchist. I don't see here supporting capitalism anywhere. I see her supporting the ideas of individualist anarchists such as Tucker and Spooner, and talking about mutualism.

<dd>From the link: <i>The schism between the two forms of anarchism has deepened with time. Largely due to the path breaking work of Murray Rothbard, 20th century individualist anarchism is no longer inherently suspicious of profit-making practices, such as charging interest. Indeed, it embraces the free market as the voluntary vehicle of economic exchange.</i> McElroy, in supporting usury and capitalist practices, has no place in this article on anarchism Also, the article is not much more than an Op/Ed piece. Frankly I'm getting really tired of people citing maybe three major writers (and I would hardly call McElroy more than a journalist with a stated bias) to draw on for the A/C "tradition". What about Kropotkin, Proudhon, DeCleyre, Parsons, Berkman, Goldman, Makhno, Malatesta, Rocker, and hell, even Chomsky and all the others I can't name off the top of my head?

<dd>Ok, so she's not suspicious of profit-making then. But then that still leaves a further issue. Is anarcha-feminism necessarily against profit making and charging interest? I don't think so.

<dd>Anarcha-feminism is simply an application of feminist theory to anarchism (did you even READ it?). Anarchism is anti-capitalist, so by extention, so are anarcha-feminists.

<dd>Sam Spade wrote: <b>If you read NPOV, it will encourage you to write for your opposition, and to create an article all reasonable, informed readers can accept (even if not enthusiastically)</b>. So what does it tell you if you write something that readers do NOT accept? Most of the regular editors are very well informed indeed, and seem to be unwilling to accept A/C as a part of "anarchism," either by definition, by history, by argument, or insistence by vocal proponents of A/C. For my part, the term "anarcho-capitalism" hardly warrants much more than an explanation in the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austrian_School_824a.html" title="Austrian School">Austrian School</a> article, or the entry on Rothbard, so limited is the scope of the topic.

<dd>The key phrase you used was <b>all reasonable persons.</b> Quibbling over whether to say "most" or "many" (as in anarchists) does alter the meaning significantly, but you have to ask what purpose does it serve? One serves the bias of the A/C perspective, and one serves the bias of the anarchist perspective. Any <i>reasonable</i> person should be able to observe at this point, after all our attempts to resolve this dispute that <b>most</b> people understand anarchism as being anti-capitalist. To say otherwise reflects not just a clear bias (in your shorthand, "POV"), but still you insist. It is unreasonable to insist on including Nationalist and Capitalist sects in an encyclopedic article on anarchism simply because there's a writer or two with a handful of followers who make absolutely no sense whatsoever. I've read the NPOV policy and the main issue stands: <b>The notion that Nationalism and Capitalism can be compatible with anarchist ideas only exists from the Point of View of those sects.</b> So yes, even if you are from any of the aforementioned groups and biases, <b>you are championing the wrong cause</b> if NPOV is truly your goal. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbamuth_eea6.html" title="User:Albamuth">albamuth</a> 23:28, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't see the relationship between your argument and your conclusion. IMO definitions of terms are based on usage, current and historical. "Anarchism" has been used to describe a far wider scope than the <a href="../../../l/e/f/Left_Anarchism_4d1a.html" title="Left Anarchism">Left Anarchism</a> which dominates this page. NPOV insist that we discuss all signifigant verifiable POVs. Maybe you define "signifigant" differently than I do, but I have to tell you, the bar is pretty low on the wikipedia. Our goal is to be comprehensive, not limited by our demographics. <big><i><b><a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a></b></i></big> 23:39, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

Still you persist in arguing for inclusion based on an <b>incorrect</b> assumption, that there is some sort of "Left Anarchism" somehow different from regular anarchism, and that the factions of that sect are daily waging battle with the A/C faction.
