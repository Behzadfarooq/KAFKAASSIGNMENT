<p>After reading about the claims about Analog and digital recording, I would be interested to know about if simlar claims have been made about analogue and digital video recording.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Probably yes, but to much lesser extent, especially since analog consumer-grade video equipment has always been quite low-spec in comparison with consumer audio e.g. <a href="../../../v/h/s/VHS_078b.html" title="VHS">VHS</a> holds the lowest rank in fidelity among analog video formats and has inferior audio even to an audio <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cassette.html" title="Cassette">cassette</a>], while the modern<a href="../../../m/i/n/MiniDV_e6b2.html" title="MiniDV">miniDV</a> format practically beats all consumer-oriented analog formats by leaps and bounds, and none ever claimed that "Video8 film or Hi8 tapes look more natural".</dd>
</dl>
<p>A comparison, if any, will (or is) being done with <a href="../../../l/a/s/Laserdisc.html" title="Laserdisc">Laserdisc</a> versus <a href="../../../d/v/d/DVD_1991.html" title="DVD">DVD</a> versus <a href="../../../f/i/l/Film.html" title="Film">film</a>, as some people don't particularly like the occasional artifacts introduced by compression in DVD movies. Also, strangely, most criticism towards digital sound is directed versus the standard audio CD, which, if properly mastered and reproduced can deliver almost 96 dB <a href="../../../s/i/g/Signal_to_noise_ratio.html" title="Signal to noise ratio">Signal to noise ratio</a>, which is far beyond the capabilities of most audio systems (and most people's ears).</p>
<p>At the same time, most DVD movies have got MPEG compressed soundtracks, even multichannel ones, but that doesn't seem to bother audio purists. Also, regarding video, whil audio can be quantized at 16 or even 20 and 21 bits with some success, video signals use special Flash DACs that are 10 or 12 bits at best. <a href="../../../e/p/i/User%7EEpiVictor_855c.html" title="User:EpiVictor">EpiVictor</a> 22:45, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Of increasing importance is also the digital vs. traditional photograp, with the later one fastly becoming what analog audio already is: a niche product. --FaZ72 21:48, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>If I may comment: When my Cable company acquired digital signals, the quality of the televised image--and I am referring to classic films broadcast on stations like Turner Classic Movies (so that I can compare image quality from the same source)--improved so dramatically that if I make a VHS recording off the broadcast, the result is a noticeably better image than what I obtain by playing a brand new commercially-purchased VHS cassette of the same film--and digitally-remastered as well. While I assume that one of the reasons for the inferior quality of the retailed cassette is the mass-production techniques, the fact is that my televised image itself improved dramatically. I can only assume that the digital image is far superior to an analog image. 66.108.4.183 22:25, 1 June 2006 (UTC) Allen Roth</p>
<hr />
<p>The language in this article and its structure and exposition could be improved, in a way that makes it clearer what the respective arguments of analog and digital are, while honoring Wikipedia's neutral POV policy. <a href="../../../f/a/z/User%7EFazalmajid_1576.html" title="User:Fazalmajid">Fazalmajid</a> 10:45, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have followed the evolution of this article over the last year or so. I would be sorry to see it deleted, because it does offer a very good overview. Some of the more extreme assertions have been removed (a good idea, in my opinion); what remains seems to present a reasonably balanced view of a rather difficult subject. Xtrapnel 11:45, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>The article makes the assertion that any signal below the recording noise floor generally cannot be reproduced, and compares the theoretical digital <a href="../../../s/n/r/SNR_8dc5.html" title="SNR">SNR</a> (given a bit depth) against the SNRs of ideal analog recording technologies. This is somewhat misleading, because the SNR at some frequencies is often higher than the broadband SNR for either digital or analog technologies. For instance, noise shaping for 16-bit PCM can improve the noise floor to well over 100db at some frequencies, and the SNR figured of vinyl are often dominated by low-frequency rumble that is generally inaudible.</p>
<p>I agree that using the lack of a quantization level as an argument for analog is specious, and that even 16-bit recording with noise shaping is probably going to beat the SNR of almost all analog technologies, at any frequency. But it's kind of a cop-out to simply line up and compare the broadband SNRs.</p>

<dd>From my experience I notice that records sound much "warmer" than compact discs. While compact discs sometimes provide more clarity, the mid range frequencies are lost in many cases. This is especially true of older recordings made prior to the digital format. A vinyl record in good condition provides the mid range frequencies which is more pleasing to the human ear, and also a warmer "richer" sound than a compact disc. Compact discs are simply easier to take care of and you are able to store more audio on a compact disc, obviously. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 65.151.133.223 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_65.151.133.223_747c.html" title="Special:Contributions/65.151.133.223">contribs</a>) .</small></dd>
</dl>
<p>Many LPs from the "golden age" of classical recording (1950-1969) sound "warmer" because record companies, especially Columbia, artificially warmed the sounds of the orchestras, in order to produce a "warmer" sound for the average listener. RCA and other companies doctored the sound much less. Consequently, orchestral music on Columbia was less "grating" to the ears. A real violin or trumpet has the characteristic high "top" that is harsh to the ear used to hearing reproduced recorded sound, and Columbia wanted a less "harsh" sound, at the expense of fidelity. As far as the issue of the reproduction of mid-range frequencies is concerned, I think you are referring to what conductors call the "texture" of the recording, i.e. the ability to discern in a recording of a group of different instrumentalists all the lines of the individual ensembles. In my opinion, one of the biggest problems with digital recording is this. When listening to an orchestral recording, the same recording on LP (analog-recorded) will display more clarity in the individual members of the orchestra, and their differing timbres and lines. In the CD, I sometimes perceive only the overrall sound, and find that the instruments carrying a counter-melody simply cannot be clearly separated from the sound of the complete recording, i.e. it sounds like a "recording," not like 80 members of an orchestra. 66.108.4.183 11:45, 26 May 2006 (UTC) Allen Roth</p>

<p>QUESTION: This article states that it is impossible to find recordings which have not been subject to digital techniques at some point. If I play one of my LPs that was manufactured before digital techniques existed, on my turntable, and use an amplifier also manufactured before c. 1980, am I not hearing analogue sound, with no digitization at any point? A reply is welcomed by anyone who has more technical expertise than I. Thank you. 66.108.4.183 11:45, 26 May 2006 (UTC) Allen Roth</p>
<dl>
<dd>Clearly, an LP produced during the analog age and reproduced on analog equipment will produce sound that has never been digitized. I suspect that the person who made the statement was referring to music produced today (or perhaps "within the last 15-20 years"?). Such music was almost certainly digitized when the original master recording was made, and was probably resampled a number of times before finally reaching you on whatever medium it did.</dd>

<dd>The video and audio quality of a VHS recording cannot exceed the limitations of the medium itself, in terms of bandwidth and frequency response (which for analog video means line and color resolution), so even the best VHS recording cannot compare to an average quality analog TV broadcasting, at least in <a href="../../../p/a/l/PAL_cf4f.html" title="PAL">PAL</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What can happen however, is that some newer TVs (and VCR's) have some picture-enhancing technology built in e.g. "Super Picture" or something along these lines, while many new TV's have a "definition" adjustment, which generate an apparently crisper or more softened image (e.g. I have a 6-head Sharp VCR with a "Super Picture" key, which apparently increases horizontal resolution somehow and makes higher frequencies (and thus more pictures details) more visible, and many of my older tapes look much better on this VCR.</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Also, using modern equipment combos (namely, recently built VCRs combined with recently built set-top boxes and recent TVs) will yield better results than using older VCRs, sometimes even compared with factory-made tapes. E.g. it's not improbable at all that the digital receiver set-top box has a better output quality (even over a normal composite output) than what was available even at factory level during e.g. the 80s or the mid 90s, so that even home-recorded VHS tapes may look better.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This is also the case for audio cassettes recorded from CD's or MP3, on most modern (even low-cost) mini or micro-hifi systems: even without Dolby enchancements, they will generally sound as good or even better than some older factory made tapes, partly because the source material will be better in most cases.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In fact, I have so many original tapes that suffer from an obviously bad mass production/dubbing job, and recording them again from a broadcast would with no doubt improve them....it's all very relative. You should try those "enchanced" VHS tapes with other TV/VCR combos, to be sure that they work OK, and try using different VCRs for recording the "digital" signal.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../e/p/i/User%7EEpiVictor_855c.html" title="User:EpiVictor">EpiVictor</a> 23:31, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK, where to start from? Oh here we go, we can start from the "arguments in favour" section:</p>
<pre>
Arguments made in favor of analog sound
</pre>
<pre>
* Shape of the waveforms: sound reconstructed from digital signals is claimed to be harsher and    unnatural compared to analog signals
</pre>
<p>OK now this one is ridicolous, as it's not specified for what class of devices this holds true or false, and from a signal processing point view it has no sense. So that means that a 10$ tape recorder reconstructs "less harsh" waveforms than digital systems? The only occurence of "harsh waveforms" would be when operating near the maximum <i>samplable</i> frequency (not <i>sampling</i>) for digital systems, and even an analog system would sound "harsh" if operated near or beyond its limit.</p>
<pre>
* Lower distortion for low signal levels
</pre>
<p>This contrasts with the "lower noise floor" for digital systems. Now, either a syetem has <b>"X"</b> dB of SNR or it doesnt. Whether a weaker signal would mean "sinking into the noise soup" or below "bit 1" doesn't matter, it wouldn't be recorded correctly in either case.</p>
<pre>
* Absence of quantization noise
</pre>
<p>This actually may have some sense, but is closely related to the SNR ratio and the quantization bits of the <i>equivalent</i> digital system. It's clear: 6 dB per bits, and 96 dB is already way beyond Hi-Fi specs ( 80 or so dB). So unless you're comparing reference vinyl with 8-bit Soundblaster samples or otherwise flawed digital recordings, and if it's true that the human ear cannot even discern between 14 and 16-bit quantization, then this is yet anoter myth to debunk. Sure, analog systems don't work in discrete steps, but they don't have infinite precision either.</p>
<pre>
* Absence of aliasing
</pre>
<p>Actually, recording an <b>unfiltered</b> signal that contains frequencies beyond the acceptable range with an analog or digital system results in <i>something</i> being recording, the fact that it's analog doesn't however magically filter out the offending frequencies, and even an analog system wouldn't yield a correct recording (try recording e.g. a high-pitched whistle with a microcassette recorder: it won't just "low pass filter" the very high frequencies beyond the tape's response.</p>
<pre>
* Not subject to jitter
</pre>
<p>That may have some validity, but requires to specify and explain which kind of "jitter" we're talking about, in which digital systems it occurs and how it can affect audio. Analog systems have their own problems (wow &amp; flutter, repeated analog amplifying and filtering stages etc.)</p>
<pre>
* Euphonic characteristics
</pre>
<p>This one definitively needs expanding.</p>
<pre>
Arguments made in favor of digital sound
* Lower noise floor
* Dynamic range
* Signal to noise ratio
</pre>
<p>These ones are all directly related to the quantization level (and also to the recording equipment and pre/post processing of course).</p>
<pre>
* Absence of generation loss
</pre>
<p>This one needs explanation.</p>
<pre>
* Resistance to media deterioration
</pre>
<p>That's a big pro of most digital systems, altough there are analog systems which can be as "tough" (e.g. LaserDisc, FM-encoded audio on Hi-Fi VHS tapes etc.)</p>
<pre>
* Immunity to wow and flutter
* Ability to apply redundancy like error-correcting codes, to prevent data loss
</pre>
<p>There should also be a mention on how cheap and relativaly easy it is to build literally millions of identical, similarly-performing digital systems , either they are Hi-End SACD players or portable MP3 players, and how easy it is to grant to even the lowliest CD/Radio combo an enviable SNR ratio comparable to e.g. a Cassette/Radio combo. <a href="../../../e/p/i/User%7EEpiVictor_855c.html" title="User:EpiVictor">EpiVictor</a> 10:12, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Apart from the quantization sections and the included math, most of the article has ridicolous or easily rebuttable arguments. Strangelu, non replied to my previous list of obesrvations, so I will write a new one about the current "pros and cons" of both systems.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Advantages of analog sound</i>
<ul>
<li><i>Analog recording is a linear representation of a linear waveform, and therefore more accurate.</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>First of all, the "linearity" is a function of frequency, and only perfectly tuned recording instruments and media achieve this supposed "linearity". Actually that's something very hard to achieve AT RECORDING time, and even harder to preserve through analog processing. ANd, BTW, a digital system is actually able to store waveforms an analog system cannot, e.g. perfectly square waveforms. Reproducing them is another matter, though.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><i>Shape of the waveforms: analog sound appears "warmer", "smoother" more "three dimensional"</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>As long as something has been sampled correctly,includes all necessary information, and is played through the right equipment, even digital sound can sound "warm" and "three dimensional".</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><i>Lower distortion for low signal levels</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Nonsense, unless you can guarantee a sensibility of less than -96dB through recording, processing and mastering phases for either analog or digital media.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><i>Absence of quantization noise</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>...and presence of a lot of other kinds of noises. Plus, there IS a lower sensibility bound even for analog systems. Sure, it's not "step like" but it's equally unusable for recording.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><i>Absence of aliasing</i></li>
<li><i>Not subject to jitter</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>These are the only ones that make sense.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><i>Euphonic characteristics</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>You've got to be kidding.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Disadvantages of analog sound</i>
<ul>
<li><i>Linear access</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>So what about vinyl records or laserdiscs? Are those linear access too? There are even remote-controlled servo assisted turntables, and even by hand you can skip to any track you want!</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><i>Subject to electrical and mechanical hiss and noise</i></li>
<li><i>Subject to wow and flutter</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Those are true...</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><i>Tape is expensive to buy and maintain</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>What kind of tape? Metal cassettes? Open reels? Who is using the latter anymore?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><i>Regenerations are inferior quality</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>True, but factory produced records or tape usually come from a digital or at least a high quality analog master and are first-gen copies. Assuming we're not talking about bootlegging, audio editing or home dubbing, this shouldn't even be an issue.</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Advantages of digital sound</b>
<ul>
<li><i>Non-linear access</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>DATs and DCCs use TAPE, aren't those linear (non-random) access???</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><i>Lower noise floor</i></li>
</ul>

<p>I understand the point that this editor was making, but I think we should distinguish between <a href="../../../j/i/t/Jitter.html" title="Jitter">jitter</a> and <a href="../../../w/o/w/Wow_%28recording%29.html" title="Wow (recording)">wow</a> and <a href="../../../f/l/u/Flutter.html" title="Flutter">flutter</a>.</p>
<p>Jitter, as the term is commonly understood, is purely a disease of digital systems and means, essentially, uncertainty in the exact timing of individual samples compared to a theoretically perfect sampling clock. Wow and flutter, on the other hand, are (pretty much) purely diseases of analog systems and mean long- and short-term variations of the sampling rate, but not really extremely short-term sample-to-sample timing uncertainties.</p>
<p>Analog systems don't jitter because 1) the data are not discretely sampled and 2) mechanical inertia makes it unlikely that you'll see extremely short-term variations in timing. Digital systems don't wow or flutter because the timing is almost always crystal-controlled; it may be wrong, but it's steady.</p>
<p>We might want to tweak the article text to make all of this more clear.</p>

<dd>That would still miss the fact that an analog (continous amplitude) system can have a non-continuous, discrete time base and viceversa, a digital system (discrete amplitudes) can have a continuous time base. Agreed, there probably aren't many Hi-Fi <a href="../../../p/w/m/PWM_8449.html" title="PWM">PWM</a> audio systems around, but exactly like it's possible for such an analog system to suffer from aliasing, it can also suffer from jitter.

<p>I did a fair amount of cleanup/correction on this article. It's shaping up nicely, although I'm not too thrilled that it ended up on the Answers.com website before it has been fully worked over. I have forwarded this page along to my mentor at the University of Miami, Ken Pohlmann, who wrote "Principles of Digital Audio" and by far knows the most about audio amongst people I know. I will say this article needed (and still needs) a lot of grammatical correction to be brought up to encyclopedia standards. I will likely work on it some more when I have some more time.</p>

<dd>Interesting edits...however signing your comments would be nice :-) (use 4 tildes ~ in a row to do that), and if you really have access to such a qualified individual's consulence, that will surely benefit the article. As an electronic engineer, I tried to tidy it up myself several times in the past, but the argument itself is hard to chow down for some reason...and filled with ambiguities. From my point of view, it would be a non-problem, since digital systems are used EVERYWHERE by now, and nobody said e.g. that an analog industrial control system is somehow better or more precise than a digital one, or that VHS tape has "truer" image than DV tape....it's just something that applies to <i>certain kinds</i> of audio systems (usually, by analog audiophiles mean only vinyl records and open-reel tape, and by "digital" they only compare with standard, preferably early or erroneously mastered CDs) <a href="../../../e/p/i/User%7EEpiVictor_855c.html" title="User:EpiVictor">EpiVictor</a> 14:15, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry, I am new to this whole Wikipedia editing thing. I would agree that this argument is pretty much moot nowadays.

<p>Ok, this is something i'm going to touch VERY briefly on becuase i'm pretty sure it's never been mentioned. Yes, vinyl has a wamer sound...and there have been people who have said it has more dynamic range...which is entirely false. Compact discs at 16 bit do have a wider dynamic range than a vinyl LP...vinyl LP's do have a fair bit of naturally occuring surface noise which decreases the amount of range you can have.</p>
<p>So why claim they sound better? A lot of it has to do with the production/mastering done with CD's. In the early digital era, there was no real post-processing in the digital domain, analog mastered content was just about transferred directly from tape to disc, giving them a dynamic range closer to the original; leaving the disc overall quieter to the ear, not to mention early A/D converters weren't as efficient as what you have now.</p>
<p>Back in the vinyl days, music had to be mastered a specific way. you had limitations you had to follow in order to make sure the groove was laid out in such a way that it was trackable, if you had too much dynamic compression, the needle won't track properly. I can't remember the exact reasoning for it, but it relates to physics. Most music today is made on a "louder is king" ideal and in comes the dynamic compression. It's this over compression that makes some people say CD's have an inferior sound to vinyl, when in reality, they're just about the same, it just depends on the mastering. However, this doesn't mean you don't benefit from using high sampling rates and resolution in transferring vinyl LP's into the computer, afterall, you're dealing with an analog source and every bit of detail you can catpure will help. Some CD's sound quite smashing; Steve Hoffman DCC-label GoldDiscs and most anything in the Mobile Fidelity catalog was made to take full advantage of the CD format. Guys like Hoffman are the only ones doing thier mastering jobs like they're supposed to...making sure the audio sounds top-notch on the media and not what some record exec wants to sell. The industry is the one killing the music. --DewDude 21 Nov 2006</p>
<p>A lot of it also has to do with people who don't really care about music anyway, and most people don't, despite what they claim. The delivery system makes absolutely zero difference. Music is in your head, not in your ears. Worrying about whether it's on vinyl or CD is like worrying about what color your car is. ---cneron</p>

<p>A digital system IS able to perfectly recreate an analog system, if it's specified to handle it (frequency, dynamic range etc). But is that really desirable by audiophiles?

<p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but most "audiophiles" seem to claim that VINYL (or analog tape) <b>sounds better to them</b>, not that they are technically superior, provide better frequency response or superior SNR ratio (which, compared even to Audio CDs, they actually <b>don't</b>, something which is scientifically provable beyond doubt).</p>
<p>E.g. when recording a precisely generated signal with specific frequencies and amplitudes, the point in the whole "analog vs digital" dispute doesn't seem to be "which medium records it more faithfully", but "which medium <i>subjectively</i> sounds better to one's ears", which means the article should either be deleted or written in a way that emphasizes that what is being discussed is essentially a subjective perception, and that there's no doubt, scientifically wise, that both an analog and a digital system can reproduce frequencies/amplitudes they were <i>designed for</i>.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, CURRENT digital or analogue media have inherent technical limitations or suffer from gross errors during production, that's another point. If the "vinyl masters" of the "golden days" mastered vinyl records using tape reel speeds of 3 m/s during recording/editing, or if some noncurant CD "masterer" produces his CDs starting from MP3 compressed audio, that's another story altogether, not a property of the media themselves. <a href="../../../e/p/i/User%7EEpiVictor_855c.html" title="User:EpiVictor">EpiVictor</a> 11:57, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I see what you're saying, but the theoretical performance of digital systems is practically limited by the quality of the converters. Therefore, a low-quality digital system can be worse objectively and subjectively than a high-quality analog system, e.g. a portable CD player versus a good quality record player (and of course vice-versa). With my edits, I've tried to concentrate on presenting information that explains how this is possible.</dd>

<dd>I see how this article does depart in style from other articles in Wikipedia on hi-fi, in that they often tend to focus on the subjective differences.

<hr />
<p>Hello</p>
<p>I had a look at your revision of <a href="../../../a/n/a/Analog_sound_vs._digital_sound.html" title="Analog sound vs. digital sound">analog sound vs. digital sound</a> as of 25 Feb 07, and think that the removed sentence was a sensible introduction to the topic of digital sound reproduction. I based this specific sentence on a part of a book referred to in the article - Driscoll, R. (1980). Practical Hi-Fi Sound, Hamlyn:</p>
<p>'...The signal begins and ends in analogue form, as it must for our ears to recognise it, but in the tape recorder it is converted into digital form (analogue to digital conversion), in fact into a binary code of discrete numbers or digits. Hence the signal which is recorded onto tape is not continuous, as an analogue signal, but takes the form of particular, discrete values. In this form, the signal is far less susceptible to noise, distortion and speed variations occuring in the tape recorder. <b>In fact a digital recording system is more immune from these problems because it does not attempt to preserve the exact, continuous form of an audio signal</b>.</p>
<p>It is necessary, of course, for the digital system to carry sufficient signal information so that after it is converted back into analogue form (digital to analogue conversion) the result is indistinguishable from the original sound, but the limitations lie only in the electronics of the system, not in the tape medium or in the mechanics of the tape recorder.'</p>
<p>- page 63</p>
<p>A different description of this is provided in Chris Dunn's and Mark Sandler's paper, 'A Comparison of Dithered and Chaotic Sigma-Delta Modulators', page 1:</p>
<p>'A perfect analogue-to-digital (AD) or digital-to-analogue (DA) conversion process would convert a signal from one domain to the other without introducing either linear errors (that is, magnitude and phase-response abberations within a specified passband) or nonlinear errors (noise and distortion). <b>While linear errors in modern converters can be made vanishingly small, quantisation theory tells us that any conversion process must contribute some degree of nonlinear error, hence a fundamental issue which must be addressed when assessing the quality of a conversion process is deciding what represents an acceptable degree of nonlinearity'</b></p>

<p>The revision you made to the part about error correction, I am slightly unclear about. In 'An Introduction to Digital Audio', Focal Press, John Watkinson describes a channel in quite precise terms. An example of a channel would be the S/P-DIF interface. Error correction is, however, used when reading data from Compact Disc's, and takes the form of, I believe, a decoding from Reed-Solomon error correction coding. I don't think that this reading of data is usually thought of as a process requiring the use of a channel. This makes me feel that the original sentence - 'Error correction coding, essential in digital audio systems, helps to eliminate bit errors', is more general than the edited one - 'Error correction coding, essential when transferring digital audio over noisy channels, helps to eliminate bit errors.'</p>
<p>When thinking specifically of the common consumer S/P-DIF interface, it is true that error detection coding is used for the channel status information, which tells the decoder whether or not the audio data has been corrupted. The audio data however, is not coded with Reed-Solomon error correction, and corrupted audio data can only be muted.<a href="../../../e/n/e/User%7EEnescot_f88a.html" title="User:Enescot">Enescot</a> 21:25, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
<i>because it does not attempt to preserve the exact, continuous form of an audio signal</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>Kind of. But when people say "digital is an approximation of analog" or whatever, it's usually because they don't really understand how digital works. We shouldn't allow the article to encourage them in this.
<ul>
<li>Sampling - People often misunderstand and think that, because the ADC is only measuring the continuous wave at discrete points in time and missing everything in between, digital is just an "approximation" of analog. Of course the <a href="../../../n/y/q/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem_fd0a.html" title="Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem">Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem</a> proves that all of the content below half the sampling frequency is reproduced exactly (with ideal filters). With real filters, as long as your flat region is significantly above (and below) the limit of audibility (beyond which you can't call it "sound" anymore), you've reproduced all of the sound exactly.</li>
<li>Quantization noise - <i>All</i> audio already has a noise floor, due to the limitations of thermal noise in analog electronics or mic elements (or <a href="../../../d/e/c/Talk%7EDecibel_a57c.html#Noise_floor_of_air" title="Talk:Decibel">the air itself</a> if the electronics were perfect?) As long as your quantization noise is well below this noise floor, you've reproduced the signal exactly.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>If I digitize an old record with a -60 dB noise floor and bandwidth of 16 kHz by putting it through my 24-bit/96 kHz sound card (realistically around 20 kHz bandwidth and 110 dB dynamic range), I'd have reproduced the signal exactly. With no loss of information at all. In fact, at 24/96 I'd have wasted a significant amount of hard drive space by storing more information than is actually present on the record.</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>error correction</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>I dunno. I'd consider a CD to be a "noisy channel", but if you want to change the wording, go ahead. Error correction codes aren't necessary and aren't used if you know there's not going to be any signal degradation, though. — <a href="../../../o/m/e/User%7EOmegatron_4264.html" title="User:Omegatron">Omegatron</a> 02:58, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I see that from a practical standpoint, you're right, but as the Dunn and Sandler paper points out, you are still adding something to the original analog signal/information, so it is therefore correct to say that digitization is an approximation. I'm afraid that your perfectly logical position about reproducing a signal exactly is likely to be true from the point of view of audibility, but audibility is a contentious area. The key point, I feel, is that digital equipment can deviate a long way from the ideal, which can produce audible differences between equipment, e.g. a high-quality separate CD player and a portable CD player.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, the specification of digital audio equipment is, in practice, fairly complex from an absolute standpoint. Measures such as dynamic range, bandwidth etc. do not fully define the objective performance of the system, i.e. 'Nonlinear dynamics of bandpass sigma-delta modulation', Feely and Fitzgerald:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>'...Despite the popularity of these converters, understanding of the operation of Σ∆ systems is far from complete. This is due to the nonlinear nature of the modulation process. The response of most engineers confronted with a nonlinear system is to approximate it by a linear system to which standard linear analysis techniques can be applied. This “linearise, then analyse” approach pervades much of the scientific literature on Σ∆ modulation. Many of the results thus obtained are incorrect not only quantitatively, but also qualitatively.'</dd>
