<h3><span class="mw-headline">What are primary, secondary, and tertiary sources?</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_source.html" title="Primary source">primary source</a>: "A primary source is any piece of information that is used for constructing history as an artifact of its times. These often include works created by someone who witnessed first-hand or was part of the historical events that are being described, but can also include physical objects like coins, journal entries, letters, or newspaper articles."</li>
<li>A <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secondary_source.html" title="Secondary source">secondary source</a>: "Secondary sources are texts based on primary sources, and involve generalization, analysis, synthesis, interpretation, or evaluation. In the study of history, secondary sources are those writings which were not penned contemporaneously with the events in question."</li>
<li>A <a href="../../../t/e/r/Tertiary_source.html" title="Tertiary source">tertiary source</a>: "Where a primary source presents material from a first-hand witness to a phenomenon, and a secondary source provides commentary, analysis and criticism of primary sources, a tertiary source is a selection and compilation of primary and secondary sources. While the distinction between primary source and secondary source is essential in historiography, the distinction between these sources of evidence and tertiary sources is more peripheral." --AaronS 16:37, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="Proposed_source_standards" id="Proposed_source_standards"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Proposed source standards</span></h3>
<p>Because this is a contentious topic, I propose that no biased sources be used; I also propose that primary sources should be avoided, and that secondary sources should be preferred. This is because "[s]econdary sources often are subjected to peer review, are well documented, and are often produced through institutions where methodological accuracy is important to the future of the author's career and reputation. A primary source like a journal entry, at best, only reflects one person's take on events, which may or may not be truthful, accurate, or complete. Historians subject both primary and secondary sources to a high level of scrutiny." (see <i><a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_source.html" title="Primary source">primary source</a></i>). While primary sources are often used by experts and historians, none of us are experts and historians; and, if we are, then we should reference our own <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reputably</a> <i>published</i> works. --AaronS 16:37, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Avoid edit wars? A likely story. Straight away Hogeye and RJII have re-introduced all the elements that they know have caused most dispute: Hogeye's pet chart of influences; the division into 'individualist' and 'collectivist' schools; the controversial intro para on dictionary definitions; major section on anarcho-capitalism in the middle of the page; liberal anarchism etc.... however much we go over the same points, these two are unwilling to give an inch. There have been edit wars in the past on all these points, and there will be again. They wear down the latest enthusiastic anti-capitalist arrivals, but sure enough more will come along soon and it'll start up all over again. In short, no progress at all, and if the page needed protection before the need hasn't gone away. Perhaps a permanent NPOV dispute tag would be the honest approach, as this is a permanent NPOV dispute.<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBengalski_c6f3.html" title="User:Bengalski">Bengalski</a> 11:27, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A Contemporary section seems crazy to me. The original types of anarchism are still contemporary --plenty of anarcho-commmunist groups around, for example.

<dd>As you know that's highly disputed. I have left AC in but moved it forward in time. And incorporated yr 'liberal anarchism' into ancapism section - these liberals are only claimed to be anarchist forebears by the ancaps, so putting them in as their own section in the 19th century is very POV. I personally am fine with taking out the historical/contemporary divide - we can then just have one timeline for the whole thing.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Max Stirner - Egoist or Anarchist?</span></h2>
<p>Frankly, I don't consider Stirner to be an anarchist, strictly speaking. He's kind of like Godwin - a very influential precursor. Two points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stirner did not consider himself an anarchist. He considered himself an egoist.</li>
<li>Stirner offered <i>no</i> anarchist theory. To him, the State was just one mental "spook" example out of many.</li>
</ul>
<p>I suggest we put Stirner in the Precursor/Origins section. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 06:07, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But there's plenty of sources that say he is an individualist anarchist. Also, how about the European Stirnerite individualist anarchists? That's individualist anarchism too --it's just not the American form of individualist anarchism. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 06:11, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I suspect we have an American individualist section due to the much more social nature of non-US individualisms. See Japan where Egoism and Syndicalism were considered compatible by leaders of the day (Bowen Raddeker, <i>Hecate</i>, 2005). Australian individualism was much more social than US individualism, it was effectively a form of social anarchism which focused its activist efforts on rationalism, humanism and militant atheism. My deeper suspicion is that these currently lie within US anarchism too, and we're seeing a retconning of US individualism into Rothbard's catagories: a solipsistic error.<a href="../../../f/i/f/User%7EFifelfoo_12d0.html" title="User:Fifelfoo">Fifelfoo</a> 06:18, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Anarchism without adjectives seems severely underplayed as well, because as far as I can tell that's how <i>most</i> anarchists identify today. Many are even unaware of the existence of factions.

<dd>Your experience is geographically limited. Look at the CGT (Spain) stats, their 70 year historical record as anarchists, versus their volume of coverage of their subject.

Examine the article history for their habits. The entire article is about 50k (down from the 90s).

<p>This is a good example of an <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeal_to_authority.html" title="Appeal to authority">appeal to authority</a> fallacy. Particularly when you consider there is no good reason to see a dictionary as a viable authority at defining a philosophy they undoubtably are not interested in. Citing definitions by early anarchists is equally problematic, particularly when you ignore constant remarks that anarchism is a form of socialism. The best source comes from secondary sources, including modern anarchists and political scientists who have made it a point to map these philosophies out. I'm willing to agree to disagree on the point, but the current notice is pushing a contested POV. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 08:54, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A dictionary is an extraordinarily good source for a definition. The reason is that the definitions they present are the result of a lot of research on how the term is used by educated people, including "modern anarchists and political scientists." So instead of us having to conduct a huge amount of research compiling hundreds of usages and finding a commonality (which would be something akin to "original research"), the researchers have already done this for us. The dictionary IS exactly the secondary source that you want for this kind of dispute. The dictionary definitions of anarchism present what the word is most often understood to mean among educated people --and that's exactly the kind of definition we should have to head the article. It's the most NPOV way to do it. (Look at the definitions of anarchism that head the anarchism article on other contemporary encyclopedias --they could have come straight out of any of the various dictionaries out there).<a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 15:57, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not at all against discussing criticisms of anarchism in the article - actually I think it's only right, as no one can deny anarchism is much abused and criticised from many sides. I'm not sure the way this has been done is very informative however - if I was coming to this ignorant of the subject Harrypotter's comments would make little sense to me - 'petit bourgeois' - what does that mean? (need to at least mention this comes from marxism, and point to sources); 'socially maladjusted' just sounds like a slander - who said this, and why? See Sterner - where, what , why? And I would think actually the most common criticisms of anarchists is that they are smelly judeo/slavic bomb-throwing terrorists (19th-early 20th century) or macdonalds-window-smashing middle class yobs with silly haircuts (contemporary). Should we stick some of that in? If so, how do we make this a serious part of the introduction that actually informs and points to useful information and debate? And does it actually belong in the intro? Or perhaps just a brief pointer to discussion of criticisms further down the page? Should there maybe be a special section on criticism of anarchism, or should we just try to be more balanced in presentation of existing sections, if they're not at present?<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBengalski_c6f3.html" title="User:Bengalski">Bengalski</a> 21:01, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Briefly looking at pages on other major political ideologies (eg. socialism, liberalism, conservatism) that seems to be the most common wikipedia approach. (Not that this means it's necessarily the right one or that we should follow it.) I.e., the intro section presents some kind of summary of the self-professed 'philosophy' or ideals of the movement, and maybe some key history; there are dedicated sections on critique later on. Even the fascism article doesn't open with criticisms, though the intro discusses the common use of the term as a pejorative.<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBengalski_c6f3.html" title="User:Bengalski">Bengalski</a> 21:47, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

If you feel strongly that we shouldn't discuss the criticisms until they're sourced then I won't object if you take them down for now.

<dd>Agree that the ordering is a bit clunky, my apologies. My preference would be to have them in the form of {{ref|&lt;author&gt;&lt;date&gt;([a-z])}}, where author and date are obvious and <i>a-z</i> is for if there are two from the same author in the same year. Obviously this isn't always possible as some sources come without an author. There are also a number of dead links in the Reference section, I didn't remove them, but they are likely to need to be removed or replaced.

<p>Communism is about everyone being the same and equal in most forms. Anarchism is about individuality and non-conforming.

<dd>Obviously anarchists have criticised each others' ideas in different areas, and where this is particularly notable as here it should be mentioned. But RJII's claim is very strong - it's not saying just that the US individualists opposed the idea of communism within anarchism, but that they (all of them? a general consensus?) believed communist anarchism was not anarchism, and was even the enemy of anarchism. Is that right? Was there never any co-operation or overlap between any of the two groups?<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBengalski_c6f3.html" title="User:Bengalski">Bengalski</a> 11:00, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I suspect that RJII may have an exclusionary definition of "19th century American individualist anarchist," such that any American anarchist in the 19th century who was individualist, but was for collective property forms, is excluded from the specific definition "19th century American individualist anarchist". However, RJII is right that there was a very specific anti-collective property trend in the individualism in the US in the 19th century. Maybe its time to include weasil words like "some" "many" or "a tendency within"
<dl>
<dd>There aren't any American individualists who were for "collective property forms" --they wouldn't be called individualists if they did. What makes them individualist anarchists is they believe individualism in person and property. It was inconceivable to them that you could be truly free while not having private property --freedom and individual ownership of the product of labor are inseparable. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 14:49, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>RJII your point is well made with a general statement that some anarchists, eg. americans x y and z, thought communism was incompatible with anarchism, with maybe one representative quote - pick your favourite.

<dd>I don't mind just one quote, but I do mind the deletion of additional sources for the claim. As you can see, someone comes along and deletes the sources except one, and in doing so, deletes evidence that it was a position of several individualists. Then, the text gets changed to say that Benjamin Tucker thought it was fake anarchism. Then, if it's noted that this was the position of several of them, someone asks for sources. I put in sources and then someone comes along and says it's too many sources and only leaves one or two. This continues ad infinitum.

<p>RJII added competition to the list of things anarchists want a society built upon. I know I am not alone in not considering competition to be a major part of my ideal future society, and to add competition without qualifications as to which anarchists support that is a bad idea, especially since it also said we wanted cooperation, which is contradictory and will confuse most people unfamiliar with anarachism (and some who are familiar). As such I removed both until we can work this out. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force">The Ungovernable Force</a> 03:46, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Individualist anarchists tend to be big on competition. For instance, Voltairine de Cleyre: "Miss Goldman is a communist; I am an individualist. She wishes to destroy the right of property, I wish to assert it. I make my war upon privilege and authority, whereby the right of property, the true right in that which is proper to the individual, is annihilated. She believes that co-operation would entirely supplant competition; <b>I hold that competition in one form or another will always exist, and that it is highly desirable it should</b>." Benjamin Tucker was also a firm proponent of competition. He believe competition was what could reduce profit to make prices accord with labor-value. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 03:50, 24 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I was pretty sure that a variety of individualists agreed that cooperation was valuable, the mutual meeting of like-minded individuals for the purposes of mutual benefit etc. Similarly there is a strain within anarchism which says that competition is a good and natural impulse (for an example, Le Guin is big on friendly competition in Dispossessed). I'm not hep up about including "competition" in the list at all. Its not nearly as important as other issues. Like getting the article size down to 40kb, having copyright acceptable images for the major points, and having apposite and appropriate citation. <a href="../../../f/i/f/User%7EFifelfoo_12d0.html" title="User:Fifelfoo">Fifelfoo</a> 04:04, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Personally I'd say competition and cooperation are equally valuable, and I think it could safely be said that in anarchist thought the whole spectrum exists from rampant competition to rampant competition <i>and</i> cooperation and rampant cooperation.

<p>The relationship between cooperation and competition is pretty clear in anarchism. Liberal anarchists believe in competition, and all other anarchists don't. In fact, all other anarchists would see competition as ruining any possibility of a working anarchy. That's pretty much the main thesis of L. Susan Brown's book <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Politics_of_Individualism_f257.html" title="The Politics of Individualism">The Politics of Individualism</a></i>. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 22:25, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What is liberal anarchism? Personally, I don't know what competition/cooperation have to do with anarchism at all. Both are a part of life in general. --AaronS 23:21, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Liberal anarchism is anarchism combined with <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberalism.html" title="Liberalism">liberalism</a>, i.e. <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_individualist_anarchism.html" title="American individualist anarchism">American individualist anarchism</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalism</a>. That is to say, anarchism that believes in the freedom of individuals to use others to serve an ends, as opposed to anarchism that believes in the freedom of individuals from other individuals. I don't know why you consider it of no importance to anarchism. In fact, a large amount of anarchist theory is specifically about the cooperation and competition. For instance, the basic thesis of Kropotkin's <i><a href="../../../a/_/f/Mutual_Aid%7E_A_Factor_of_Evolution_170d.html" title="Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution">Mutual Aid</a></i> is that humans (and other species) are naturally cooperative, and must be to survive. Bakunin and Bookchin have argued similarly. L. Susan Brown disagrees, insisting human nature does not exist, but argues that a belief in competition contradicts any belief in individual freedom. Liberal anarchists, by contrast, see people as naturally competitive, etc. Liberal anarchists tend to be more accepting of capitalism because they aren't opposed to competition or using others to serve an ends, whereas other anarchists see this as a massive contradiction. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 23:37, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes. In fact, I've come across a book in my library on exactly this topic. It's <i>Anarchist thought in India</i> by Adi Hormusji Doctor. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 22:33, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's not "settled" but it's legitimized. It's not settled that individualist anarchism is true anarchism. It's not settled that anarcho-communism is true anarchism. Whether it's settled or not is beside the point. If some notable historians and political scientists say something is anarchism, then it needs to be in the article.

<p>MrVoluntarist and RJII, I ask that you try to assume <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">good faith</a>. My requests have been reasonable. So far, RJII has only provided <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> and <i>two</i> main sources -- where do you see 'infinity'? -- Ralph Raico and Carl Levy. Levy's source has already been shown to not back up many of the claims made, here. Raico's neutrality is questionable. So, are you going to produce everything, or are you just going to continue to <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">attack me personally</a> contrary to Wikipedia <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiquette_3717.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiquette">guidelines and policies</a>?

<dd>I <i>did</i> assume good faith with you. It's just that I'm convinced now that you're not acting in good faith. You won't accept sources no matter how credible they are.

<p>Actually, you were initially immediately very hostile or uncivil towards me. Please provide here a list of sources that you think that I've ignored, "no matter how credible they are." Honestly, I would like to know. Thanks. --AaronS 04:20, 25 January 2006 (UTC) Furthermore, even if you do <i>believe</i> that I'm acting in bad faith (I would like some evidence of that), that does not give you the right to treat me uncivilly.

<dd>The (main) issue isn't whether Hogeye's right or wrong, or well sourced, on any particular connection eg. that Nietzsche influenced Rothbard. The issue is one of whether this link is relevant to anarchism, or more generally whether its relevance is strong enough that it fits with NPOV 'weighting'. If we were to put in every accurate chain of influence that applies to any notable anarchist thinker we would have a monkey puzzle tree of a million names. You would also have many non-anarchists as prominent nodes, Marx just one of them. To get something manageable we have to trim down to a few names, and it is the selection of these names and links that is controversial original research. Hogeye's choice is plainly POV. But in fact I think it is so inherently controversial that even without the ancapism issue we would probably never find consensus on a tree of ten or even a hundred names from the editors of this page. Things are just more complicated than that, and I don't see that such a tree serves any useful purpose.<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBengalski_c6f3.html" title="User:Bengalski">Bengalski</a> 09:33, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The chart is clearly relevant to anarchism. You write, "To get something manageable we have to trim down to a few names, and it is the selection of these names and links that is controversial original research.," but that could be said of the whole article or any given section. Yet we all know who most of the big names are, and/or the representative opinions anyway.

<dd>The problem I have with the chart is that we can't modify it. I basically agree with the content but there are some things I would change. If a flow-chart function were available in Wikipedia so we call all modify it that would be great. As it stands now, it has to be taken down and modified for each editor's input and Hogeye is apparently the only one with the authority to do that. I appreciate his efforts and I like the chart, but I can't see it working out in the long run for these reasons. But, I could be wrong. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 18:19, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hogeye, the current tree is better. But I think you should:</p>

<dd>I don't understand where you'd like Rocker moved. Are you suggesting omitting his name?

<dd>The current chart doesn't use the term "anarcho-socialism." I can't say much about weight - that is totally subjective. Judging by something objective, like google hits, anarcho-capitalism is more significant than e.g. anarcho-syndicalism. Certainly both should be included in the chart.

<p>Hogeye, it appears that you have violated Wikipedia policy in breaking the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>. I know that, in the past, you and RJII have stated that you have no problem with edit wars, and will happily create them; however, we try to avoid them as much as possible, and they certainly go against what Wikipedia is about. I am simply going to caution you this time, and ask that you please review <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">the three revert rule policy</a>. One more revert, and I'm going to request that an administrator review what is going on, here. I hate to be harsh, but you're being very disruptive, in my opinion. Thanks. --AaronS 15:23, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You've made that claim many times before, but this isn't anarchy, it's Wikipedia. And you agreed to abide by certain rules when you decided to participate. --AaronS 15:42, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Exactly. It's not anarchy. There are no "true anarchists" who would bring in authority. You know, people say the same thing about nations, such as "You agree to abide by the rules if you live here. If you don't like it you can leave." Is that something a "true anarchist" would say?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Anarchist communism and Labor Theory of Value</span></h2>
<p>I thought RJII would find this interesting, as he tends to give the opinion that most anarchists support a labor theory of value. This is a passage from Alexander Berkman, describing anarchist communism, in his work <i>ABC of Anarchism</i>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"But why not give each according to the value of his work?" you ask.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Because there is no way by which value can be measured. That is the difference between value and price. Value is what a thing is worth, while price is what it can be sold or bought for in the market. What a thing is worth no one really can tell. Political economists generally claim that the value of a commodity is the amount of labour required to produce it, of "socially necessary labour," as Marx says. But evidently it is not a just standard of measurement. Suppose the carpenter worked three hours to make a kitchen chair, while the surgeon took only half an hour to perform an operation that saved your life. If the amount of labour used determines value, then the chair is worth more than your life. Obvious nonsense, of course. Even if you should count in the years of study and practice the surgeon needed to make him capable of performing the operation, how are you going to decide what "an hour of operating" is worth? The carpenter and mason also had to be trained before they could do their work properly, but you don't figure in those years of apprenticeship when you contract for some work with them. Besides, there is also to be considered the particular ability and aptitude that every worker, writer, artist or physician must exercise in his labours. That is a purely individual, personal factor. How are you going to estimate its value?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That is why value cannot be determined. The same thing may be worth a lot to one person while it is worth nothing or very little to another. It may be worth much or little even to the same person, at different times. A diamond, a painting, or a book may be worth a great deal to one man and very little to another. A loaf of bread will be worth a great deal to you when you are hungry, and much less when you are not. Therefore the real value of a thing cannot be ascertained; it is an unknown quantity.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But the price is easily found out. If there are five loaves of bread to be had and ten persons want to get a loaf each, the price of bread will rise. If there are ten loaves and only five buyers, then it will fall. Price depends on supply and demand.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The exchange of commodities by means of prices leads to profit making, to taking advantage and exploitation; in short, to some form of capitalism. If you do away with profits, you cannot have any price system, nor any system of wages or payment. That means that exchange must be according to value. But as value is uncertain or not ascertainable, exchange must consequently be free, without "equal" value, since such does not exist. In other words, labour and its products must be exchanged without price, without profit, freely, according to necessity. This logically leads to ownership in common and to joint use. Which is a sensible, just, and equitable system, and is known as Communism.</dd>

<dd>I don't say that most anarchists support the labor theory of value. I say the American <i>individualist anarchists</i> are into the labor theory of value. The communists want to abolish exchange value altogether.

<p>RJ, it is more accurate to say that anarcho-socialists generally hold an <b>exploitation theory</b>. (As opposed to "labor theory of value.") While many base their exploitation theory on the LTV, some base it on e.g. an <i>unequal bargaining position</i> argument. Berkman's "argument" is confused. He admits that something "may be worth much or little even to the same person, at different times," but then he inconsistently assumes without reason that, somehow, profit is bad and should be avoided. After saying that there is no fixed value ("cannot be ascertained; it is an unknown quantity"), he, contradicting himself, claims that "exchange must be according to value." What a dumbshit! <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 15:31, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just because something is unpredictable doesn't mean nothing is affected by it.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Criticisms of anarchism</span></h2>
<p>The essay Harrypotter's linked too is an interesting read, and raises issues that would be worth going into if we develop a more detailed page on criticisms. The stuff about Green Anarchist I knew, though all the details of changes of editorship and infighting etc. - which perhaps he should have gone into - send me to sleep. I've never bothered to read much by Black or Zerzan, so the anti-semitic quotes were new to me, though I'm not altogether surprised. But I don't see what evidence he's actually got against Rocker - in fact the author goes so far to say Rocker never perpetrated the racist bile of his mentor Bakunin. So it seems Rocker is just being slandered by association, because he shares other of Bakunin's ideas and (non-racist) language. Therefore I'm not sure there are grounds in this for mentioning Rocker specifically in the page as a suspect racist anarchist.</p>
<p>My general thought on all this - there are dodgy people and dodgy ideas floating around with them in any political movement/grouping/ideology whatever you call it. I would think you could find racists, or people who've gone over to fascism, from any political group under the sun. So fringe characters like Black or some who've been associated with Green Anarchist doesn't make me think there's something rotten at the core of anarchism. Proudhon and Bakunin as 'founding fathers' are more troubling, but the article very much fails to demonstrate the links from their racism to the way central anarchist ideas have developed thereafter, as the weakness of the bit on Rocker shows. The claim is - P and B had some nasty ideas, they were the daddies of anarchism, so anarchism's nasty. But that needs some argument, which this essay doesn't provide.<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBengalski_c6f3.html" title="User:Bengalski">Bengalski</a> 20:02, 26 January 2006 (UTC) Reading that passage about Black more closely, and trying to find more on the web (unfortunately 'anarchism after leftism' doesn't seem to be online), it looks like Black's maybe being maligned as well. The quote could equally just be pointing out Bakunin's anti-semitism and ridiculing Bookchin for supporting him.<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBengalski_c6f3.html" title="User:Bengalski">Bengalski</a> 09:14, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

Just providing the quote here to so it can be recorded in the archive, as I haven't seen it on any web pages out there and someone has already edited to an abbreviated form: "The anarchists, as anarchists, work directly, not for a perfect social state, but for a perfect political system. A perfect social state is a state totally free from sin or crime of folly; a perfect political system is merely a system in which justice is observed, in which nothing is punished but crime and nobody coerced but invaders." -Victor Yarros, Liberty VII 1/2/1892

<dd>One that comes immediately to mind is from Emma Goldman: "Crime is naught but misdirected energy. So long as every institution of today, economic, political, social, and moral, conspires to misdirect human energy into wrong channels; so long as most people are out of place doing the things they hate to do, living a life they loathe to live, crime will be inevitable, and all the laws on the statutes can only increase, but never do away with, crime." <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 21:43, 26 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That and also a) 'collectivist' anarchists might also have communal social controls, eg. most 'social' anarchists are happy with the idea of organising workers' militias to fight fascists or other aggressors; b) I think you'll find the majority of social/political thinkers also believe private defence forces to be unfeasible (have a look at those essays on the first page of googling anarcho-capitalism, or e.g., Hogeye's favourite book by Nozick).<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBengalski_c6f3.html" title="User:Bengalski">Bengalski</a> 21:46, 26 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>To be honest, I was a bit surprised at first to hear about private defense, even in relation to anarcho-capitalism. I actually came to anarchism <i>through</i> libertarian capitalism and anarcho-capitalism, and even then I was staunchly opposed to police forces. I effectively saw stealing as a natural balancing force for capitalism and disproportionate wealth, and a welcome one. I didn't read any Rothbard or even any libertarians though, so I don't know how common those sort of ideas are among those groups. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 21:52, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The reply to the claim from anarchists that criminality is not human nature is, then why do governments exist? They exist because criminal-minded humans created them (according to an anarchist point of view). Crime and virtue are both natural to humans. The question is, how are you going to defend yourself from the criminals? <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 21:59, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes that's the question. I'd give you my view but that'd be original research. Seriously, these are the kinds of issues we should be investigating - properly sourced, without original research of course - on Criticisms of Anarchism. But I will say I think your PDAs are vulnerable to just the same kind of criticism - what's to stop them using their power of organised violence to turn themselves back into governments? If you accept the usual liberal view of human nature, it'd certainly be in their rational interest to do so. Why wouldn't you have 'criminals' controlling the PDAs? I've seen you and Hogeye arguing competition between rival PDAs would stop any one emerging as a monopoly - but I haven't seen any good arguments, though praps we're talking the kind of oligopoly of rather nasty violence you usually get in most non-state-gang-controlled areas. So, as Plato might have said, who's going to defend us against the defence associations?<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBengalski_c6f3.html" title="User:Bengalski">Bengalski</a> 22:16, 26 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think I've ever argued that there is not a danger of one emerging as a <i>coercive</i> monopoly. I do think that is a possibility. But, that's exactly what the anarcho-capitalists oppose --the emerging of large-scale coercive monopoly --a State. It looks to me like you have two choices --have voluntarily funded competing defense providers and <i>hope</i> it doesn't happen, or don't have private defense of liberty and just let a State emerge uncontested and impose itself on everyone. Take your pick. Or, if you're willing to be a minarchist, you can set up a forcefully-funded limited government with a strong Constitution, and separation of powers to prevent absolute tyranny, as a "necessary evil" --commit a small evil to defend against a larger evil. But, even with this latter choice you're <i>hoping</i> that corruption doesn't set in expanding the scope of the government, and also you hope that a more powerful, and more evil, government doesn't invade. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 22:25, 26 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The other point I made - I don't think any 'social' anarchists would just 'let a state emerge uncontested'. Thus in Spain (I know it's a cliche but ...) anarchists organised militias against aggressors. As I see it a key belief was that such use of violence must not become professionalised - we don't want to give the opportunity to anyone to be in a position to have special access to the means of violence, as you would have with a professional PDA. Violence is then something that may be engaged in reluctantly and with force distributed as equally as possible amongst communities. Just as anarchist organisations recognise sometimes the need for bureaucratic positions, but try to rotate positions and build in recall sanctions etc. Some questions are then - 1) are these kinds of organisations strong enough to be effective - eg. the Marxist critique of anarchism in the Spanish civil war is the militias just weren't an effective fighting force; 2) does a 'structureless' tyranny develop anyway? I think these are both important criticisms, and I'm not sure can be refuted with theory alone.<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBengalski_c6f3.html" title="User:Bengalski">Bengalski</a> 23:03, 26 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"<i>[The Indians] had separated into so many little societies. This practice results from the circumstance of their having never submitted themselves to any laws, any coercive power, any shadow of government. Their only controls are their manners, and that moral sense of right and wrong, which, like the sense of tasting and feeling in every man, makes a part of his nature. An offence against these is punished by contempt, by exclusion from society, or, where the case is serious, as that of murder, by the individuals whom it concerns. Imperfect as this species of coercion may seem, crimes are very rare among them; insomuch that were it made a question, whether no law, as among the savage Americans, or too much law, as among the civilised Europeans, submits man to the greatest evil, one who has seen both conditions of existence would pronounce it to be the last; and that the sheep are happier of themselves, than under care of the wolves. It will be said, the great societies cannot exist without government. The savages, therefore, break them into small ones.</i>" -Thomas Jefferson, Notes on Virginia. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 23:12, 26 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah. A modern take on the same idea - that decentralised non-state 'coercion' can work but only small groups - and with a touch of game theory too, is Michael Taylor 'Community, Anarchy, and Liberty' [<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0521270146/103-3438908-5473421?v=glance&amp;n=283155" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0521270146/103-3438908-5473421?v=glance&amp;n=283155" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>].

<p>Rocker makes his position very clear in <i>Nationalism and Culture</i>, perhaps summarised by the last paragraph of the book, where he envisages an anarchist revolution amongst Europeans then being spread out amongst colonial peoples. Rocker was a very strong anti-fascist, learning yiddish and was very active amongst Jewish workers in Germany and London. Yet his book <i>Nationalism and Culture</i>, perhaps the most significant work he rwote (it's about 500 pages long) talks about the European orbit of culture, dwells on teh glories of ancient Greek culture, but glossing over the fact it was based on slavery. In many ways he takes forward Bakunin's "United States of Europe" (see <i>Federalism, Socialism and Anti-Theologism</i> 1867), sharing a viewpoint rooted in an unstated white supremacism, albeit cultural rather than biological. Just as biological racism has been discredited over the last fifty years, cultural aspects, particularly around questions of assimilation and eurocentrism have become more central to anti-racist critiques.</p>
<p>In this context,I also think we should locate the origins of anarchism in the development of European political thought which arose following the French Revolution, along with communism. The retrojection of anarchism before that is more a mythic approach to origins. I think the piece about Louis-Armand, Baron de Lahontan is important (just as the work of <a href="../../../l/e/w/Lewis_Morgan_dee3.html" title="Lewis Morgan">Lewis Morgan</a> was to influence Marx and Engels), and indeed there is an argument that <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_More_90f1.html" title="Thomas More">Thomas More</a>'s <a href="../../../u/t/o/Utopia.html" title="Utopia">Utopia</a> was modelled on <a href="../../../y/u/c/Yucatan.html" title="Yucatan">Yucatan</a>. No matter how inspirational some anarchists may have found pre-anarchist movements/philosophies, this does not make them anarchist. Outside Europe, the spread of anarchism (and marxism) poses all sorts of questions as regards being forms of modernism linked to notions of unilinear progress which has been critiqued (not always satisfactorily) by post modernism, and are sometimes considered as being harbinger of eurocentrism.

<dd>Stirner and chaos magic?? My view on all this is this is a page about anarchism, and what we need to say about any particular thinker/actor concerns their contribution/influence on anarchists. That's why I'm no too bothered by Bakunin's anti-semitism for example - because I'm not convinced that it found its way into the development of later anarchist thought. Equally why I'm not so bothered if Proudhon became a liberal/statist/proprietarian/whatever (if he did) - the point for me is the part of his thought and life that influenced anarchism, the rest is relevant on the PJProudhon page but not here. So what's relevant about Sterner is: his notable influence on many anarchists, the fact he was considered by many anarchists to be an anarchist, and yes the fact that he himself wouldn't have gone along with it. Whether ACrowley mixed any slogans or ideas from Stirner (did he? it seems so long since I last conjured up any demons) into his wacky stew is beside the point. (Unless you've got some evidence for a grand masonic conspiracy linking anarchism with the golden dawn etc., and of course P2 - which would be interesting to see.)<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBengalski_c6f3.html" title="User:Bengalski">Bengalski</a> 16:01, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../m/r/v/User%7EMrVoluntarist_23fd.html" title="User:MrVoluntarist">MrVoluntarist</a> misunderstood my suggested policy for <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_02e7.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite">citing sources</a> for this page.

The Russell quote regarding the Anabaptists is the perfect kind of source.

<dd>Russell was a socialist. You've rejected sources because the author promoted capitalism. You're rejected books published by reputable publishers. By your standard, he is not neutral.

<p>From the Wikipedia entry on Bertrand Russell: "Continuing a family tradition in political affairs, he was a prominent liberal as well as a socialist and anti-war activist for most of his long life. Millions looked up to Russell as a prophet of the creative and rational life; at the same time, his stances on many topics were extremely controversial."

<dd>The <i>Southern Economic Journal</i> sources seem legitimate, as does the <i>Journal of Political Economy</i> one. I think that my main problem was that the articles never discussion anarcho-capitalism as being related to classical anarchism in any way; they just refer to it as "anarchy." Well, <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_relations.html" title="International relations">international relations</a> scholars refer to Hobbes' state of nature as being <i>anarchy</i>, and compare it to the reality of international relations, which they believe exist in anarchy. Should we include those conceptions of anarchy in this article on anarchism, as well? I would so so, if said IR scholars were comparing international anarchy to anarchism, but they are not. And it doesn't seem that these scholars are comparing market anarchy to anarchism, either. Perhaps I haven't read the articles thoroughly enough (in fact, I am certain of this). If you have, and know that I'm wrong, I invite you to show so. I don't care -- I just want this article to be accurate. --AaronS 15:14, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Of course you haven't read the articles thoroughly enough. Your idea of "reading an article thoroughly" is claiming that critics of an idea really support it, and hoping others won't notice the titles of the articles that establish they are critics. I bring this up repeatedly because it reveals bad faith. The reason they are relevant is because they are critiques of anarho-capitalist systems and reference them as "anarchy". That demonstrates that anarcho-capitalism has been referred to as anarchism. <a href="../../../m/r/v/User%7EMrVoluntarist_23fd.html" title="User:MrVoluntarist">MrVoluntarist</a> 15:39, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Russell was the <i>first</i> to mention communism in the context of Anabaptists (or at least it was original for him if someone indepedently so decided). That makes him <i>primary</i> for the claim that "communism = Anabaptism". If the claim were just about what Anabaptists did, the actual records from them would be primary, and references thereto would be secondary.

As for strawman, come on Aaron, you went to a good college, don't make mistakes like this. A strawman is when you distort someone's position and attack it. I did not distort your position.

That's why my standard has always been the following: (a) sources should come from neutral observers (i.e. why would Russell want to make Anabaptists look like anti-authoritarians?); (b) sources should be published by university presses, major publishing companies, or should be part of the canon of a well-known author neutral <i>with regard</i> to the subject at hand (Russell, I dare say, is a bit more well-known than Kevin Carson, for instance); and so on... --AaronS 01:21, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The Russell quote has nothing to do with communism??? I thought you had given up making obviously false claims and hoping people didn't notice.

This is the quote: "repudiated all law, since they held that the good man will be guided at every moment by the Holy Spirit...[f]rom this premise they arrive at <b>communism</b>...." Why include the communism part? To imply that communism is necessarily anarchist? As for your last question, you're missing the point (again). The relevant claim is that of <i>anarcho-capitalism being anarchism</i>. Yes, minarchists want to promote laissez-faire. No, they certainly don't care about whether anarcho-capitalism is a form of anarchism. <a href="../../../m/r/v/User%7EMrVoluntarist_23fd.html" title="User:MrVoluntarist">MrVoluntarist</a> 02:12, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, they <i>do</i> answer the question at hand. (At least fifth time I've explained this to you.)

That the passage was intended to promote an idea part of his controversial philosophy (that communism has a long history) means the whole source is tainted for purposes of categorizing the philosophy of Anabaptists. <a href="../../../m/r/v/User%7EMrVoluntarist_23fd.html" title="User:MrVoluntarist">MrVoluntarist</a> 15:39, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Does <i>snarkiness</i> constitute incivility? <i>everyone asks me what 'snarky' means. it's a term i stole from my friend laura. all those canadian chicks are so snarky, but apparently some of yankee ones are too, so it fits. the urban dictionary defines it as an adjective meaning 'a witty mannerism, personality, or behavior that is a combination of sarcasm and cynicism. usually accepted as a complimentary term'. not a bad definition, but goes on to point out that general snarkiness is sometimes mistaken for a snotty or arrogant attitude. snarks are so misunderstood. sure, snarky can be bitchy. snarky can be moody. but underlying snarkiness is this feeling of being amused even in the midst of irritation. and i'd like to expand on the definition."</i> <a href="http://snarkychick.com/rodomontade.htm" class="external text" title="http://snarkychick.com/rodomontade.htm" rel="nofollow">snarkychick</a>. My problem with the Russell quote is that it is retrojection, the anabaptists were not part of a social movement called anarchism, and as religious group they did not express themselves either philosophically or politically - in the sense that politics emerges with the rise of the bourgeoisie and <i>les politiques</i> as part of secularisation which took place in Europe. Check the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anabaptist.html" title="Anabaptist">Anabaptist</a> page, and it refers to Kropotkin's remark as regards anarchism which is clearly POV as is Russell's. To my mind the anabaptists were neither anarchist nor communist, but certainly Christian. The desire of anarchists, communist or otghers for that matter to retroject their beliefs in an ahistorical way is a feature of political philosophies worthy of mention without suggesting that it has vailidity. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarrypotter_9204.html" title="User:Harrypotter">Harrypotter</a> 14:56, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Russell's 'History of Western Philosophy' is a very mainstream text - e.g., it standardly features on reading lists of introductory university philosophy courses. Harrypotter's point about 'retrojection' is important, but on the other hand it would be wrong to say that there weren't (small c) communist ideas and movements before the modern era, often associated with 'heretical' religious movements. I think all the sources on anabaptism say there were early anabaptist groups which advocated communal property - this certainly wasn't Russell's invention. How exactly this early 'communism' should be related to anarchist and/or communist traditions we know from the French revolution onwards is however a good question.<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBengalski_c6f3.html" title="User:Bengalski">Bengalski</a> 17:30, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've been thinking about this a bit. If we place the origins of anarchism and communism in the French revolution, then we can explain how they both seek to justify their politics by citing historical precedents. Different strands of anarchism have different approaches to history - the primitivists tend to try and jump over it for example compared to the Marxist conception of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primitive_communism.html" title="Primitive communism">Primitive communism</a> (which is actually where they source their ideology). Perhaps we could have something like Historical Precursors and say that these are examples cited by anarchists because they have given them inspiration or as evidence of the practicality of their ideas. Then we could have a piece about origins in the French revolution. We also need a piece about repression of anarchism.<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarrypotter_9204.html" title="User:Harrypotter">Harrypotter</a> 18:20, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're splitting hairs. LvMI is "partisan" in the sense that it supports capitalism. Ergo, you're opposing Raico's analysis because he supports capitalism. If LvMI were an orginazation that merely believed people should study history, you probably wouldn't consider that (partisan) agenda a reason to exclude them.

<dd>I'd like to point out that, contrary to Aaron's assumption, Raico's paper was not published by the Ludwig von Mises Institute. It was merely posted to their web site on April 20, 2005. It was actually published in 2004 by The Polytechnic School at the Research Center of Applied Epistemology in assocation with the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) --or in French "<a href="http://www.crea.polytechnique.fr/index.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.crea.polytechnique.fr/index.htm" rel="nofollow">Ecole Polytechnique at the Centre de Recherce en Epistemologie Appliquee</a>, Unité associée au CNRS." It's noted at the bottom of the article, before the references. I'm looking forward to see what kind of bogus objection Aaron is going to come up with now. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a>

<dd>I would like for once for you to contribute anything to this discussion without resorting to <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_civil_04ec.html" title="Wikipedia:Be civil">incivility</a>. Your attitude has continually been hostile, uncompromising, and incendiary. While your own words in the past show that you enjoy breeding conflict (despite the negative affect that such behavior has on the encyclopedia), I see no reason not to point out your anti-social failures. That said, I stand corrected. --AaronS 03:16, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I really think you should shape up. You're behavior on this encylopedia is reprehensible. You're rude to others and won't accept sources when presented. Then when you're flagged on that, you lash out with bogus claims of "incivility" or other such nonsense. Now, you're backed into a corner with nowhere to turn and you amazingly say "I stand corrected." Well congratulations for taking a first step in reasonability, even though you had to vitiate it with personal attacks. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 03:25, 31 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Since you make mention of shaping up, I suppose that it is relevant to note that you do a terrible job of spinning disputes in your favor. I have never been anything but respectful towards you in the past, praising your efforts and dedication to those subjects which interest you, despite my disagreement with what many perceive to be your tendency to shape research in a way that reflects a particular point of view -- it seems that, as many others before me have noted, you tend to <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truthiness.html" title="Truthiness">bend the truth</a> towards an overall picture that is favorable towards libertarianism and provides for a distinctive libertarian pedigree. I also find it notable that, despite your false indignation, you have no evidence to speak of when you accuse me of disruptive behavior. Stating that your contributions to Wikipedia form a long litany of anti-social failures does border on incivility; however, I only say so after having failed to get you to communicate in a constructive and helpful manner on so many different occasions. What can I say? You seem to fail to communicate. And that failure seems to come from an anti-social attitude, where you see yourself as being "superior" to your "competitors" -- your words, not mine (see your RfC and RfArs). I am through, however, with giving you the benefit of the doubt. I will tolerate you as long as you respect the policy of this encyclopedia and as long as you are civil towards others. As soon as you waiver from that straight and narrow path, however, and as long as I am obliged to work with you, I will call you on it. For all of your hot air and steam, you have very little to back up your accusations against me. As for you, I have the complaints of dozens of users, your history of bans, your RfArs and RfC, and dozens upon dozens of diff links. Do not pretend for one instant that those people who are working on this encyclopedia are fooled for one instant by your half-hearted attempts to defame those who disagree with you. You target me, because I am as persistent as you. I do not become frustrated easily. And I will not be bullied by someone such as yourself. I find it interesting that you are "amazed" that I had the cojones to admit that I was wrong. I have no problem admitting fault when it is made apparent to me. Every mistake is an opportunity to learn and grow. Perhaps you might try to do the same -- I think that you'll find adulthood to be quite agreeable. --AaronS 04:53, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>He says that I have rejected "books published by reputable publishers." I have never done such a thing. He claims that I rejected three academic journal articles simply because I didn't like them; that's false, too. He brought up the articles to prove that <i>anarcho-capitalism is a form of anarchism</i>. The articles, however, do not compare anarcho-capitalism to anarchism, as far as I know. The refer to it as "anarchy," and make no mention of anarchism as it is commonly understppd, much in the same way that realist <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_relations.html" title="International relations">international relations</a> scholars refer to international relations as being in a state of anarchy. I asked in good faith for MrVoluntarist to correct me if I am mistaken; after all, the burden of proof is on him, not me. Instead of doing so, he decided that it would be more fruitful for the discussion at hand to ridicule me and claim that I am acting in bad faith. They do not sufficiently answer the question "Is anarcho-capitalism a form of anarchism?" I am not saying that this question <i>can't</i> be answered, I'm simply arguing that, since MrVoluntarist seems so bent on somehow proving me to be a bad-faith hypocrite, the reason why I rejected them as sources is because they aren't relevant to that question at all. The word "anarchy" is used in many ways, many of which have nothing to do with "anarchism.</li>

<dd>The article doesn't have to directly compare anarcho-capitalism and anarchism. The claim is about how the terms "anarchy" and "anarchism" are actually used by real scholars. The three journal articles are critiques of anarcho-capitalism. They feel no need to specifically distinguish it from anarchism. They are using anarch- to refer to an anarcho-capitalistic system. That is real evidence of the usage of a term. <a href="../../../m/r/v/User%7EMrVoluntarist_23fd.html" title="User:MrVoluntarist">MrVoluntarist</a> 16:57, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>He claims that a primary source is "the one from which the claim originates," whatever that means. Regardless, it's false. The article on <a href="../../../t/e/r/Tertiary_source.html" title="Tertiary source">tertiary source</a> explains: "Where a primary source presents material from a first-hand witness to a phenomenon, and a secondary source provides commentary, analysis and criticism of primary sources, a tertiary source is a selection and compilation of primary and secondary sources." The article on <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_source.html" title="Primary source">primary source</a> explains further: "These often include works created by someone who witnessed first-hand or was part of the historical events that are being described, but can also include physical objects like coins, journal entries, letters, or newspaper articles." Moreover, the article on <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secondary_source.html" title="Secondary source">secondary source</a> explains yet further: "Secondary sources are texts based on primary sources, and involve generalization, analysis, synthesis, interpretation, or evaluation. In the study of history, secondary sources are those writings which were not penned contemporaneously with the events in question." Russell is <i>not</i> a primary source with regard to describing the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anabaptists.html" title="Anabaptists">Anabaptists</a>. Anabaptists = <a href="../../../1/6/t/16th_century.html" title="16th century">16th century</a>. Russell = <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a>.

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I know when Russell and the Anabaptists lived, and you're not listening. A primary source for "Anabaptists did X, Y, and Z" or "Anabaptists claimed that..." would be the records left behind by them and direct witnesses. A primary source for "Anabaptism is a form of communism" could not occur earlier than the use of the term "communism" in this context. Recall the point you chose to forget: When RJII gave you an example of an undisputed anarchist (Tucker) claiming that a supporter of rent, interest, and profit (Auberon Herbert) was an anarchist, you dismissed this as a primary source. That source was parallel to the Russell quote. If Russell counts as a valid, unbiased secondary source for saying who was a communist, Tucker counts as a valid, unbiased secondary source for saying who was an anarchist, and therefore the article cannot say that anarchists necessarily oppose rent, interest, or profit.

<p>Having raised a the topic previously I have rearranged the opening paragraph. As the term started off as a term of abuse in the French revolution, I started off with this and then used the cop definition - which although a hundred years later does constitute a sourced definition. Then it goes into the self definition which I have reordered a bit. Then I have placed anarcho-capitalism alongside anarcho-nationalism as examples of disputed concepts of what is authoritarian and what is libertarian (should a left-right dimension be mentioned here?) Having removed the piece from criticisms to the front, I then went back and put in the bit about Engels arguing that Anarchists weren't violent enough! I think the national anarchism page needs to be reworked as it is too narrowly revolving around the likes of Troy Southgate, whereas it should include a broader range of anarcho-nationalists like Larry Gambone and the <a href="../../../z/a/p/Zapatista.html" title="Zapatista">Zapatistas</a>.

<dd>I managed to peruse your changes, though I haven't had a chance to take a thorough look at them. Things look good so far. I'm sure that there will need to be further work done -- probably much more. The more that we discuss, the better. I also think that it is safe to say that anarcho-capitalism exists as a disputed concept. One question: if post-left anarchy, for example, is not a "school" of anarchist thought, but an offshoot, why is this? Is it because there are no main thinkers? But there are. Is it because there is no intellectual pedigree? But there is. Is it because there isn't a large "movement," per se? Perhaps. The point of this reasoning is this, and perhaps someone like RJII could answer: if post-left anarchism is not a "school" of thought, why is anarcho-capitalism?</dd>
<dd>As for your comments regarding a left-right dimension, I think that that is very tricky. Post-left anarchists, among others, will deny that their philosophy is "leftist." That old dichotomy just seems to breed confusion. I sometimes use the left-right spectrum, but it is really out of intellectual laziness. --AaronS 22:47, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, I am unsure how useful the left-right spectrum is. Some of the post left anarchists are <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultra-left.html" title="Ultra-left">ultra-leftists</a>, whilst others I would consider as being right wing (e.g. <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Black_61d6.html" title="Bob Black">Bob Black</a> and <a href="../../../a/_/j/Anarchy%7E_A_Journal_of_Desire_Armed_62db.html" title="Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed">AJODA</a>, but then as the <a href="../../../n/o/u/Nouvelle_Droite_ba12.html" title="Nouvelle Droite">New Right</a> has mixing right and left as its praxis this hardly resolves the issue.<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarrypotter_9204.html" title="User:Harrypotter">Harrypotter</a> 23:03, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Right - "left" and "right" are meaningless terms today. Anarchism is about liberty vs authority, not left and right. BTW, Rothbard considered anarcho-capitalism to be ultra-left, and socialism to be a confused centrist movement. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 00:15, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't believe the claim that the term "anarchist" started off as a term of abuse for sans-coulottes. I believe the claim in the article that Louis-Armand, Baron de Lahontan used the term in his Nouveaux voyages dans l'Amérique septentrionale, (1703) in reference to the stateless societies of American Indians. So I changed the intro back to its previous version. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 00:09, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I like Harry's idea of opening with that - need to be completely sure it's right though. (I though Lahontan has used 'anarchy' in his essay, which could be argued is not the same as the first use of anarch-ism.) The anarcho-nationalism stuff I'm not so sure about. a) I just don't see anarcho-nationalism as nearly notable enough to be in the intro like this (I feel the same about anarcho-capitalism in fact). b) you are making it seem more notable I think by bundling a few things together that are quite distinct - I don't think there's much link between Troy Southgate and Zapatismo at all. Southgate can call himself what he wants, but most people would call a 3rd positionist neo-fascist spade what it is. Besides, this is an insignificant groupuscule if ever there was one. The Zapatistas on the other hand wouldn't call themselves anarchists or nationalists, or the latter at least not in anything like a third positionist sense.<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBengalski_c6f3.html" title="User:Bengalski">Bengalski</a> 11:34, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hogeye, it looks like the tree is saying Stirner was a capitalist. I suggest that the whole right 2/3 of the chart be changed to "individualist," and the left 3rd, maybe, "social" or "communist/syndicalist" <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 16:48, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Stirner did support private property, and had nothing against profit, so he was a captalist. Just do a "find" on "property" in his essay "The Individual and his Property" - also translated as "The Ego and His Own" - to see that this is so. It's interesting that propertarians tended to overlook Stirner's amoralism, while socialists tended to overlook his support of private property.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There are at least two logical ways to classify anarchisms: individualism vs. collectivism, and socialism vs. mutualism vs. capitalism. Either way makes sense. The first is neat and clear, since it's pretty easy to tell who supports private property and who doesn't. There has been some opposition to this classification, mainly based on semantics. Anarcho-socialists are economically collectivist (i.e. against private property), but can be individualist in methodology or in their justifications. This bugs the hell out of people who don't like to use the terms (individualism and collectivism) in the economic sense. The threefold division by economic system makes a lot of sense to me. We can generally tell which econ system the main theorists take, and it avoids confusing and acronistic language, e.g. of the mutualists who referred to themselves as socialist (using a definition of socialism no longer used.) I think the article should make clear that mutualism is neither socialism nor capitalism - it's a different animal. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 17:48, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That's why I said "balance out" POVs. It's POV to assert that mutualism is individualist; it's a mixture of both.

<dd>Mutualism is the economic system of the individualist anarchists. It's individualist --pro-private property. There's nothing collectivist about mutualism. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 18:29, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm sorry, Infinity; you are obviously unaware of the definition of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_individualism#Economic_individualismeconomic" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_individualism#Economic_individualismeconomic" rel="nofollow">economic individualism</a>. Please get a clue:</dd>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>The doctrine of economic individualism holds that each individual should be allowed autonomy in making his own economic decisions as opposed to those decisions being made by the state, or the community, for him. Morever, it supports the liberty of individuals to own property as opposed to state or collective arrangements.</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dd>In short, mutualists, since they support private property, are economic individualists by definition. It's not that hard, Infinity: If they support private property (like Steiner and Tucker) they are economic individualists. If they don't support private property, they are economic collectivists. The only anarchist luminary where there's any question is Proudhon, who spoke opaquely out of both sides of his mouth. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 18:40, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>If economic individualism means mere support of private property, ie single ownership, then everyone except hardcore communists are economic individualists, and so the term becomes meaningless. The term "mutualist" suggests a degree of co-operation - collective. <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfinity0_7a16.html" title="User:Infinity0">Infinity0</a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/f/User_talk%7EInfinity0_df0a.html" title="User talk:Infinity0">talk</a></sup> 18:42, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You won't find a source anywhere denying that mutualism is individualist. Sure, mutualists believe in cooperation, but so do capitalists. But, mutualists also strongly support competition --that's the whole premise behind the mutualist system --that competition will make profit impossible. Competition is the force that mutualists want to harness. (Also, cooperation is not incompatible with individualism, at all). <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 18:56, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No; all anarcho-socialists are opposed to private property in capital goods (the means of production) - not just hardcore commies. Mutualists support private property in capital goods.

<p>Frankly, you just want something to split left-anarchism from ind-anarchism and right anarchism. You need to add "social unexploitative" and "socially exploitative" at the top, since individualists and left-anarchists believe capitalism to be exploitative. <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfinity0_7a16.html" title="User:Infinity0">Infinity0</a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/f/User_talk%7EInfinity0_df0a.html" title="User talk:Infinity0">talk</a></sup> 19:19, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think the tree is acceptable and should be included. Like I said before, every arrow on the tree is well-documented, and only claims <i>influence</i> not <i>derivation</i>. No arrow in the tree is the result of someone's original research. (Though it should avoid making Stirner or Nietzsche appear capitalist.) To those who say it "simplifies" or "reduces", please, open your eyes. Everything on Wikipedia is a simplification or reduction.

I think we can ignore frivolous claims like, e.g. the terms <i>economic collectivism</i> and <i>economic individualism</i> are POV.

<dd>That isn't remotely true. I would oppose any image, even if anarcho-capitalism wasn't mentioned at all. Any image is inherently simplistic and your particular images are also full of flat out bullshit. For instance, you call Stirner a capitalist, you call a non-anarchist an anarchist (if all it takes to be an anarchist is to want the state abolished, Marx was an anarchist too), you call Bakunin a socialist anarchist, when no such thing exists. It's als fucked up chronologically, and gives the impression that anarcho-capitalism has been around forever. "Economic collectivist" is another neologism, the idea of a "tree" suggests very simplistic influences. What help does it give anyone to say Bakunin-&gt;Kropotkin-&gt;Rocker?

Addressing some of Sarge Baldy's points:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Was Stirner a socialist, mutualist, capitalist, or <i>none of the above</i>?</b> I would say "capitalist" or "none of the above." He seemed to be a propertarian ("All great, all beautiful things can never be common property.") He seemed to oppose both rights and "gift economies" ("Overcome yourself even in your neighbor: and a right that you can rob you should not accept as a gift.") If you define "capitalist" as someone who thinks private ownership in the means of production is permissable, then Stirner is a capitalist.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><b>Was Gustav de Molinari an anarchist?</b> Obviously, by the definition of "anarchism." Is the pope catholic? Molinari thought (at least in 1849) that the State was an unnecessary evil, ergo he was an anarchist.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><b>Was Marx an anarchist?</b> Hell, no. He wanted a transitional State.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><b>Is there such a thing as a "socialist anarchist"?</b> Obviously. Most anarchists are socialist. Bakunin, Kropotkin and Emma Goldman were all socialist and anarchist. How can you claim, Sarge, that they don't exist?</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><b>Is "economic collectivism" a neologism?</b> No, it's two words. "Economic" is an adjective and "collectivism" is a noun. From Wikipedia: "Generally speaking, collectivism in the field of economics holds that things should be owned by the group and used for the benefit of all rather than being owned by individuals."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectivism" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectivism" rel="nofollow">[15]</a></li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><b>Do the main schools of anarchism differ in economic theory?</b> Definitely. Classifying forms as socialist, mutualist, and (in modern times) capitalist is standard and reasonable, as is noting the difference between collectivist and individualist schools.</li>

<dd>Stirner wasn't a socialist, mutualist, or capitalist, and probably would have eschewed them all. Saying X is Y by the definition of Y is original research. And anarchism does not have an agreed upon definition, no matter what you might think, and is not interpreted the same way by any two people. If anarchism meant <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-statism.html" title="Anti-statism">anti-statism</a>, then there would be no need for the latter article. If you can get these two articles merged by consensus, than you might have an argument. However, I can tell you right now that that isn't what would happen. The idea of retroactively claiming people were anarchists is clearly POV, and such interpretations are original research. The same is true for retroactively stating that people were capitalists. "Socialist anarchism" is a blanket term for almost all anarchists from the communists to the individualists. As such the label has no real meaning. I didn't ask whether the "schools" of anarchism differ in economic theory. However, a tree missing most of its branches is POV by ignoring all the others.</dd>

It's probably impossible to tell what Stirner was using his writing as a source.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Bakunin was influenced by Marx</span></h3>
<p>"In Paris Bakunin again met Herwegh, the latter’s wife, Emma Siegmund, and Karl Marx, who had arrived there in 1843. Marx at first collaborated with Arnold Ruge, but he and Engels soon went their own way and began to formulate their own ideology. Bakunin saw much of Proudhon, with whom he held night-long discussions, and was also on friendly terms with George Sand. The years in Paris were the most fruitful for Bakunin’s intellectual development – it was then that the basic outlines of the ideas underlying his revolutionary program began to take shape, though it was not until much later that he freed himself entirely of metaphysical idealism. Bakunin himself informs us, in a manuscript written in 1871, of his intellectual relations with Marx and Proudhon during this period." <a href="http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/guillaume/works/bakunin.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/guillaume/works/bakunin.htm" rel="nofollow">James Guillaume, Michael Bakunin: A Biographical Sketch</a></p>

<p>"1872: In Neuchatel, Peter met Guillaume, one of Bakunin's closest associates. Peter received a positive impression of both Guillaume and the Jura Federation. Fascinated by the lack of organization in the federation, he wished to see it in action. To see the Jura workers themselves, Peter traveled to Sonvilier, where he met another Federation leader, Adhemar Schwitzguebel. He introduced Peter to the workers in the region, most of which were watchmakers. The isolated and self-sufficient nature of the workers impressed Peter. He saw a community of workers that succeeded when permitted to work according to their own interests. It is at this exact point in his life where he felt that he became an anarchist. He even considered staying in Switzerland as a permanent fixture in the Jura Federation."<a href="http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/kropotkin/chronology.html" class="external text" title="http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/kropotkin/chronology.html" rel="nofollow">Chronology of Peter Kropotkin's Life</a> This seems to be a synopsys of <i>Anarchism</i>, George Woodcock, chapter 7 "The Explorer".</p>

<p>"In contrast to Proudhon and Bakunin, Kropotkin advocated community ownership, not only of the means of production, but of the products of labour as well, as it was his opinion that in the present status of technique no exact measure of the value of individual labour is possible, but that, on the other hand, by a rational direction of our modern methods of labour it will be possible to assure comparative abundance to every human being. Communist Anarchism, which before him had already been urged by Joseph Dejacque, Élisée Reclus, Errico Malatesta, Carlo Cafiero, and others, and which is advocated by the great majority of Anarchists today, found in him one of its most brilliant exponents." - <a href="http://www.spunk.org/library/writers/rocker/sp001495/rocker_as1.html" class="external text" title="http://www.spunk.org/library/writers/rocker/sp001495/rocker_as1.html" rel="nofollow">Rudolf Rocker, <i>Anarcho-syndicalism</i>(1938)</a></p>

<p>"In Boston, Tucker became politically involved with the 1872 presidential campaign of Horace Greeley, and made the acquaintance of the veteran individualist anarchists Josiah Warren and William B. Greene through attending a convention of the New England Labor Reform League in Boston, a veritable hotbed of individualists. Greene, who served as the chairman, made an immediate and deeply favorable impression upon the young M.I.T. student.(10) The introduction to both Greene and Warren had been facilitated by the abolitionist and labor reformer Ezra Heywood. Tucker would later look back upon these initial encounters as the pivotal point in his career as a radical. At the convention, Tucker purchased Greene's book entitled Mutual Banking and Warren's True Civilization, along with some of Heywood's pamphlets.</p>
<p>An ongoing association with Heywood, the publisher of the Princeton labor reform periodical The Word, soon followed.(11) From his involvement in the labor reform movement, Tucker became convinced that economic reform must underlie all other steps toward freedom. From a later admiration of the radical abolitionist Spooner, Tucker's voice acquired a radical anti-political edge as well. To these influences were added the European flavor of Herbert Spencer, Pierre Joseph Proudhon, Max Stirner, and Michael Bakounine." - Wendy McElroy, <i>Benjamin Tucker, "Liberty," and Individualist Anarchism</i><a href="http://www.zetetics.com/mac/tir1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.zetetics.com/mac/tir1.htm" rel="nofollow">[18]</a></p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Nietzsche was influenced by Stirner</span></h3>
<p>Friedrich Nietzsche, the second great "superseder" of Stirner, was born in the same year (even in the same month) in which Stirner's "Der Einzige" appeared. However, during Nietzsche's youth, the entire Left Hegelian school of thought was generally not taken seriously, instead termed the madness of some Vormaerz outcast lecturers and riotous journalists. Annoyed by the "senility" of his fellow students, the young Nietzsche in contrast, in a letter extolled exactly those same eighteen-forties as being a "time full of intellectual spirit" in which he himself would gladly have been active. Thus, the direct contact with a veteran of Left Hegelian times was also a turning point for the future philosopher. In October of 1865, Nietzsche had a long and intensive encounter with Eduard Mushacke, who in those days had belonged to the inner circle revolving around Bruno Bauer and had been friends with Stirner. The immediate result was a deep, intellectual crisis and a panicked "decision for philology and for Schopenhauer." - Bernd A. Laska, <i>Max Stirner, a durable dissident</i><a href="http://www.lsr-projekt.de/poly/eninnuce.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lsr-projekt.de/poly/eninnuce.html" rel="nofollow">[21]</a></p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Rand was influenced by Nietzsche</span></h3>
<p>"She was introduced to Nietzsche by a cousin, who informed her that "he beat you to all your ideas," and reading Thus Spoke Zarathustra, she had found a kindred spirit. Nietzsche revered the heroic in man, he urged men to great purposes for their own happiness, he defended egoism, he condemned altruism, and he opposed the glorification of mediocrity. On the other hand, there was too much emphasis on feeling over reason, she thought, Neitzsche was too preoccupied with condemning the negative, and his praise of power made her uncomfortable...her sense of difference intensified. But, Nietzsche was still for her a poet and philosopher of individualism, and it is possible to trace in her earlier works up though Anthem (1938) occasional literary echoes of his writings, and some Nietzschean elements...Nietzsche articulated and expanded upon ideas she had already formulated and had been presenting to others...Nonetheless, the influence was real."

<p>Bastiat emphasized the plan-coordination function of the free market, a major theme of the Austrian School, because his thinking was influenced by some of Adam Smith's writings and by the great French free-market economists Jean-Baptiste Say, Francois Quesnay, Destutt de Tracy, Charles Comte, Richard Cantillon (who was born in Ireland and emigrated to France), and Anne Robert Jacques Turgot. These French economists were among the precursors to the modern Austrian School, having first developed such concepts as the market as a dynamic, rivalrous process, the free-market evolution of money, subjective value theory, the laws of diminishing marginal utility and marginal returns, the marginal productivity theory of resource pricing, and the futility of price controls in particular and of the government's economic interventionism in general. - Thomas J.

<p>"The publisher in question was the Foundation for Economic Education; and visits to this group’s headquarters led Rothbard to a meeting with Ludwig von Mises. Rothbard was at once attracted to Mises’s laissez-faire economics, and when Mises’s masterwork Human Action appeared in 1949, it made a great impression on him. He was henceforward a praxeologist: here in Mises’s treatise was the consistent and rigorous defense of a free economy for which he had long been in search. He soon became an active member of Mises’s seminar at New York University. Meanwhile, he continued his graduate studies at Columbia, working toward his Ph.D. His mentor was the eminent economic historian Joseph Dorfman, and Rothbard received the degree in 1956, with a thesis on The Panic of 1819 that remains a standard work." - David Gordon, <i>Murray N.

<p>At one of our gatherings, in the summer of 1954, over three years before the publication of Atlas Shrugged, [Murray] Rothbard brought up the name Ayn Rand, whom I had not previously heard of. He described her as an extremely interesting person and, when he observed the curiosity of our whole group, asked if we would be interested in meeting her. Everyone in the group was very much interested. He then proceeded to arrange a meeting for the second Saturday night in July, at her apartment in midtown Manhattan. ... At both meetings, most of the time was taken up with my arguing with Ayn Rand about whether values were subjective or objective, while Rothbard, as he himself later described it, looked on with amusement, watching me raise all the same questions and objections he had raised on some previous occasion, equally to no avail. - George Reisman, <i>Capitalism: A Treatise on Economics</i><a href="http://www.noblesoul.com/orc/bio/reisman.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.noblesoul.com/orc/bio/reisman.html" rel="nofollow">[26]</a></p>

<p>"In forty-five years of scholarship and activism, Rothbard produced over two dozen books and thousands of articles that made sense of the world from a radical individualist perspective. In doing so, it is no exaggeration to say that Rothbard created the modern libertarian movement.3 Specifically, he refined and fused together:</p>
<ul>
<li>natural law theory, using a basic Aristotelian or Randian approach;</li>
<li>the radical civil libertarianism of 19th century individualist-anarchists, especially Lysander Spooner and Benjamin Tucker;</li>

<h4><span class="mw-headline">Stirner</span></h4>
<p>The thoughts had become corporeal on their own account, were ghosts, e. g. God, Emperor, Pope, Fatherland, etc. If I destroy their corporeity, then I take them back into mine, and say: "I alone am corporeal." And now I take the world as what it is to me, as mine, as my property; I refer all to myself. - Max Steiner, The Ego and Its Own.</p>
<p>Before this god -- State -- all egoism vanished, and before it all were equal; they were without any other distinction -- men, nothing but men. The Revolution took fire from the inflammable material of property. The government needed money. Now it must prove the proposition that it is absolute, and so master of all property, sole proprietor; it must take to itself its money, which was only in the possession of the subjects, not their property. Instead of this, it calls States-general, to have this money granted to it. The shrinking from strictly logical action destroyed the illusion of an absolute government; he who must have something "granted" to him cannot be regarded as absolute. The subjects recognized that they were real proprietors, and that it was their money that was demanded. Those who had hitherto been subjects attained the consciousness that they were proprietors. Bailly depicts this in a few words: "If you cannot dispose of my property without my assent, how much less can you of my person, of all that concerns my mental and social position? All this is my property, like the piece of land that I till; and I have a right, an interest, to make the laws myself." - Max Steiner, The Ego and Its Own.</p>

<p>The tree doesn't say Molinari was an anarchist (nor Nietzsche, nor Rand, nor Marx). Come to think of it, please don't add claims to this list that the tree doesn't make. Let's justify it as is (or fail to), then move on to expanding it. <a href="../../../m/r/v/User%7EMrVoluntarist_23fd.html" title="User:MrVoluntarist">MrVoluntarist</a> 02:40, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, it does. That's why there's a box around his name. Hogeye has also claimed that Molinari was an anarchist. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 02:42, 1 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>How does there being a box around his name imply he's an anarchist? I don't see a legend that says "box = anarchist". Nor does it use "anarch-" to describe him. And it's irrelevant what else Hogeye claims. This section of the talk page is for documenting the claims of the chart in question, not every claim that Hogeye has ever made. <a href="../../../m/r/v/User%7EMrVoluntarist_23fd.html" title="User:MrVoluntarist">MrVoluntarist</a> 02:44, 1 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Have you even looked at the chart? The individuals with boxes are those that Hogeye deemed anarchists, and those without are not. Hogeye intended him to be considered an anarchist, and has said so. Hell, even if you want to continue disagreeing with the person who created the tree, then it's clear that the tree singles out one non-anarchist and effectively pushes a POV towards him. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 02:48, 1 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The tree is in dispute. Hogeye's brain is not. Let's focus. <a href="../../../m/r/v/User%7EMrVoluntarist_23fd.html" title="User:MrVoluntarist">MrVoluntarist</a> 02:49, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>It doesn't matter. There are credible sources that say Monlinari is an anarchist. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 02:54, 1 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, if you want to include that issue in discussion of the tree, here's the place to list your sources. Not that I disagree with you, I just wanted to be able to keep it in one place. <a href="../../../m/r/v/User%7EMrVoluntarist_23fd.html" title="User:MrVoluntarist">MrVoluntarist</a> 02:58, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>And undoubtably there are many credible sources that say he wasn't. Therefore, by claiming that he was we're expressing a POV. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 02:56, 1 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually, Sarge, that's where you're wrong. There is no source contesting that Molinari was an anarchist, or that he was an anarcho-capitalist. Wikipedia editors can't even give an original research reason why he wasn't ancap. <a href="../../../m/r/v/User%7EMrVoluntarist_23fd.html" title="User:MrVoluntarist">MrVoluntarist</a> 02:58, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Ok, where's your source for that? We can always modify the chart to account for disputed anarchists. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 03:00, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, to be honest I don't know how many sources say that. It'd be like finding sources to show Marx wasn't an anarchist. People don't bother arguing things that are already commonly accepted. If a few sources do bother to argue something, it's because it isn't commonly accepted. That's why you'll read some people say that Marx was an anarchist <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22marx+was+an+anarchist%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22marx+was+an+anarchist%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">[32]</a> while no one bothers arguing that he wasn't <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22marx+wasn%27t+an+anarchist%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22marx+wasn%27t+an+anarchist%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>. That hardly concludes anything, except that people are more likely to make arguments against the status quo than defend the status quo against points that hardly receive popular attention. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 04:14, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

"Molinari later added considerably to Say's early formulation of free-market anarchism by introducing the idea of paying for police services and protection by contracting individually with insurance companies. He was even to argue that national defense could be better supplied by competing companies on the free market and that small proprietary communities would gradually replace the leviathan state. It was with Molinari that the two different currents of anarchist thought converged: he combined the political anarchism of Burke and Godwin with the nascent economic anarchism of Adam Smith and Say to create a new form of anarchism that has been variously described as individualist anarchism, anarcho-capitalism, or free market anarchism." - David Hart, GUSTAVE DE MOLINARI AND THE ANTI-STATIST LIBERAL TRADITION<a href="http://homepage.mac.com/dmhart/Molinari/Thesis.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://homepage.mac.com/dmhart/Molinari/Thesis.html" rel="nofollow">[34]</a></p>
<p>Also: <i>"Molinari first presented his ideas on the complete privatisation of all government functions, a form of liberal anarchism in other words, in Gustave de Molinari, "De la production de la sécurité," Journal des Économistes, 1849, vol. 22, pp. 277-290, and a little later in Les soirées de la rue Saint-Lazare: entretiens sur les lois économique et défense de la propriété (Paris: Guillaumin, 1849), "Onzième soirée," pp. 303-337, and in other works throughout his long life. Molinari's anarchist form of laissez-faire liberalism is discussed in David M Hart, "Gustave de Molinari and the Anti-statist Liberal Tradition: Part I," Journal of Libertarian Studies, Summer 1981, vol. V, no. 3, pp. 263-290.</i></p>
