Many Marxists have participated honestly in anarchist <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolution.html" title="Revolution">revolutions</a>, and many anarchists have participated honestly in Marxist revolutions. However, anarchism and Marxism have strong disagreements on issues including the nature of the state, the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_class.html" title="Social class">class</a> structure of society, and the method of <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_materialism.html" title="Historical materialism">historical materialism</a>.</p>

<p>Modern political scientists generally define the "state" as a centralized, hierarchical, governing institution which maintains a <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monopoly_on_the_legitimate_use_of_physical_force.html" title="Monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force">monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force</a>, in keeping with the definition originally proposed by the German sociologist <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Weber_eff0.html" title="Max Weber">Max Weber</a> in his 1918 essay <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_as_a_Vocation_d90e.html" title="Politics as a Vocation">Politics as a Vocation</a>. This definition is accepted by nearly all schools of modern political thought other than Marxism, including anarchism. Marxism has a unique definition of the state: that the state is an organ of one class's repression of all other classes. To Marxists, any state is intrinsically a <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictatorship.html" title="Dictatorship">dictatorship</a> by one class over all others. Therefore, within <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marxist_theory.html" title="Marxist theory">Marxist theory</a>, should the differentiation between classes disappear, so too will the state.</p>
<p>However, there is some convergence of views. Anarchists believe that any state will inevitably be dominated by a political and economic elite, therefore becoming effectively an organ of class domination. Conversely, Marxists believe that successful class repression almost always requires a superior capacity for violence, and that all societies prior to socialism are ruled by a minority class, so that in Marxist theory any non-socialist state will possess the properties attributed to all states by anarchists and others.</p>
<p><a name="The_process_of_transition" id="The_process_of_transition"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_and_Marxism_d262.html" title="Edit section: The process of transition">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The process of transition</span></h3>
<p>The theory of the state leads directly into the practical question of what form the transition to the stateless society both anarchists and Marxists view as their end goal will take.</p>
<p>Marxists believe that a successful transition to stateless <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">communism</a> will require the repression of capitalists who would otherwise re-establish their own control, and therefore the existence of a state in some form run by workers (see <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictatorship_of_the_proletariat.html" title="Dictatorship of the proletariat">dictatorship of the proletariat</a>). Anarchists contend that the "workers' state" advocated by Marxists is a logical impossibility since, as soon as any group begins to govern by means of a state apparatus, they cease being workers (if they ever were) and become oppressors. Also the idea of the dictatorship of the proletariat has been criticized by most anarchists both on a theoretical and historical basis. Mainly, it is argued that it is not a class that takes power but a minority, a party in the Leninist sense, and so is a dictatorship over the proletariat. They point to the measures taken by Lenin, Trotsky and Stalin during the Russian Revolution since as early as 1917 as evidence of this. Anarchists support their arguments by pointing to the undemocratic nature of the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> and other self-identified "Marxist" states, while Marxists support theirs by pointing to the defeat of anarchist-led revolutions such as that during the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Civil_War_7a30.html" title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a>.</p>

<p>Therefore, both Marxists and anarchists wish to "smash" the existing state. After the "smashing" of the state, Marxists seek replacing it immediately a workers state, ie the dictatorship of the proletariat, or the workers organized as the ruling class. From this point, as expressed by Frederick Engels, the worker's state will begin to wither away, finally ceasing to exist when class antagonisms have been defeated. On the other hand, anarchists feel the re-creation of any sort of state will place power in the hand of a tiny minority, and state oppression will only continue. Many Marxists respond to this saying that the organized, centralized repression of the capitalist class will be absolutely necessary, and that the proletariat can only accomplish this by the use of the state.</p>
<p>The Marxist position blends into anarchism at one end of the spectrum, because anarchists disagree amongst themselves if a system of democratic <a href="../../../w/o/r/Workers%27_councils.html" title="Workers' councils">workers' councils</a> with a monopoly of violence constitutes a state or not, while Marxists disagree widely among themselves over the form of the <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictatorship_of_the_proletariat.html" title="Dictatorship of the proletariat">dictatorship of the proletariat</a>.</p>

<p>The issue of seizing state power brings up the issue of <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_party.html" title="Political party">political parties</a>, which also divides anarchists and Marxists. Most Marxists see political parties as useful or even necessary tools for seizing state power, since they view a centrally coordinated effort as necessary to successfully defeat the capitalist class and state and establish a body capable of maintaining power. However, Marxists disagree on whether a revolutionary party ought to participate in bourgeois elections, what role it should have after a revolution, and how it should be organized. On the other hand, anarchists generally refuse to participate in governments, and so do not form political parties, since they view any hierarchically organized structure as having an inherent tendency to become authoritarian and oppressive. However, many of them do organize politically on the basis of direct democracy and federalism in order to participate more effectively in popular struggles and lead the people towards social revolution (by example and diffusion of ideas).</p>

<p>Another practical question closely related to the theory of the state is whether and how much violence is acceptable in order to achieve a successful revolution. Anarchists argue that all states are "illegitimate" because they all rely on systematic violence, and that while small-scale violence and even targeted assassination of criminal elites may be useful or necessary in some circumstances (see <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda_by_the_deed.html" title="Propaganda by the deed">propaganda by the deed</a>), mass violence against ordinary people - such as that practiced by <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalin.html" title="Stalin">Stalin</a> in the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Purges_f772.html" title="Great Purges">Great Purges</a>, or by <a href="../../../m/a/o/Mao.html" title="Mao">Mao</a> during the <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_Revolution_5b68.html" title="Cultural Revolution">Cultural Revolution</a> - is never acceptable or justifiable. Most Marxists argue that large-scale violence is legitimate and so "<a href="../../../j/u/s/Just_war.html" title="Just war">just war</a>" is possible, at least in the limited circumstances of collective self-defense, for example against an attempted coup or an imperialist invasion. Some (notably <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalinists.html" title="Stalinists">Stalinists</a>) argue further that in general "the ends justify the means," so that in theory any amount of violence and bloodshed may be justified in order to achieve communism.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some Anarchists promote self-defense rather than large-scale anti-state violence. Some promote non-violent protests, marches, and general strikes, only condoning violence in self-defense against aggressive actions taken by the State to prevent non-violent anarchist revolutions. Many anarcho-socialists such as Individualist and Mutualist Anarchists however usually prefer reformist approaches rather than open violence and would only advocate such under extreme circumstances. Modern social anarchists most often promote non-violence and violence only in self-defense, but do not believe in reformist approaches.</p>

<p>Both Marxist and anarchist class analyses are based on the idea that society is divided up into many different "classes", each with differing interests according to their material circumstance. The two differ, however, in where they draw the lines between these groups.</p>
<p>For Marxists, the two most relevant classes are the "<a href="../../../b/o/u/Bourgeoisie.html" title="Bourgeoisie">bourgeoisie</a>" (owners of the <a href="../../../m/e/a/Means_of_production.html" title="Means of production">means of production</a>) and the "<a href="../../../p/r/o/Proletariat.html" title="Proletariat">proletariat</a>" (wage laborers). Marx believed that the unique historical circumstances of industrial workers would incite them to organize together and seize the state and the means of production from the business class, collectivize them, and create a classless society administered by and for workers. He explicitly dismissed peasants, other "petty-bourgeois" small property-holders, and the "lumpen-proletariat" - the unemployed "underclass" - as incapable of creating revolution.</p>
<p>The anarchist class analysis predates Marxism and contradicts it. Anarchists argue that it is not the whole ruling class who actually has control over the state, but a minority which is part of the ruling class (and thus, defending its interests), but with its own concerns, particularly retaining power. A revolutionary minority taking over State power and imposing its will on the people would be just as authoritarian as the ruling minority in capitalism, and would eventually constitute itself as a ruling class. This was predicted by Bakunin long before the Russian revolution and the fall of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Also, traditionally anarchists have advocated that a successful revolution needs the support of the peasantry, and that it can only get it by redistribution of land between landless peasants and minifundists. That is, it explicitly rejects imposing state property of the land, although voluntary collectivization is seen as more efficient and thus supported (indeed, during the Spanish revolution anarchists impulsed hundreds of collectivizations but only a tiny minority had all the land in the area, small peasants were allowed to cultivate their own land without hired labour).</p>
<p>Some modern anarchists (particularly <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parecon.html" title="Parecon">pareconists</a>) argue that there are three “classes,” which have relevance to social change - not two. The first is the labor class (which includes everyone whose labor is involved in producing and distributing goods as well as much of the so-called “service” industry). This includes farmers, peasants, small landowners, small business owners who labor with their employees and blue, pink and white-collar workers. The second is the coordinator class which includes everyone whose labor is primarily concerned with “coordinating” and managing the labor of others primarily on behalf of the bourgeoisie, administrating organizations, setting the intellectual status quo or managing the State apparatus. The anarchist definition of the "coordinator class" includes people such as bureaucrats, technocrats, managers, administrators, middle-class intellectuals (such as economists, political and social scientists, mathematicians, philosophers, etc.), physical scientists, judges, lawyers, military officials, political party organizers and leaders, etc. And finally the elite owning class or "capital class" (which derives its income from its control of wealth, land, property and resources). They further contend that Marxism fails, and will always fail, because it creates a dictatorship of the coordinating class and that a "dictatorship of the proletariat" is a logical impossibility. Some believe that Marxism fails because its theoretical "socialist mode of production" involves centralizing and empowering the State apparatus which empowers people from the coordinator class to seize control of the State and means of production to manage the labor class, effectively acting as a surrogate capital class. However, this is less of a problem for libertarian Marxists who believe that such as State apparatus should operate on working class-led participatory democracy or even as a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consociational_state.html" title="Consociational state">consociational state</a>.</p>
<p>Key differences thus include the fact that Anarchists do not differentiate between peasants, lumpen, and proletarians and instead define all people who work for the profit of others as members of the working class, regardless of occupation; and that anarchists do differentiate between the economic and political elites who set policy and the business and government functionaries that carry those policies out whereas Marxists lump the two together.</p>
<p>Further, some Anarchists argue that Marxism fails because it springs from the minds of middle class intellectuals, while arguing that anarchism springs spontaneously from the self-activity and self-organization of the labor class. They point to the fact that schools of Marxism are often named after the intellectuals who formed the movements through high analytical and philosophical praxis theorization. While schools of Anarchism tend to emerge from organizational principles or forms of practice and are rarely (if ever) named after or centered around an individual intellectual. Anarchists distinguish themselves by what they do, and how they organize themselves where as Marxists tend to distinguish themselves by their strategic approach and their philosophical or intellectual methodology. Marxists, however, contend that their ideas are not new ideologies which sprang from intellectuals but are ideas which form from the class contradictions of each economic and social mode of history. They argue that Marxian socialism in particular arose from the minds of the working class due to the class contradictions of the capitalist mode of production. Some Marxists even argue that Anarchism springs from the ideas of proletarians (or even petty bourgeoisie) who have been marginalized by capitalism as an unorganized and unrefined reactionary struggle against the forces of capitalism.</p>

<p>The Marxist class analysis has consequences for how Marxists relate to the liberation movements of groups such as <a href="../../../w/o/m/Women.html" title="Women">women</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indigenous_peoples.html" title="Indigenous peoples">indigenous peoples</a>, <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_minorities.html" title="Ethnic minorities">ethnic minorities</a>, and cultural minorities (such as homosexuals). Marxists support such liberation movements, not only because they are worthy in and of themselves, but also on the grounds that they are necessary for a <a href="../../../w/o/r/Working-class.html" title="Working-class">working-class</a> revolution, which cannot succeed without unity. However, many Marxists believe that attempts by oppressed people to liberate themselves will continue to fail to achieve their full aims until class society is done away with, because under <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalism.html" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a> and other class societies, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_power.html" title="Social power">social power</a> rests at the point of production.</p>
<p>Anarchists and others criticize Marxists for giving class priority in this way and in explaining the causes of historical change, arguing that to do so denigrates other oppressions, which operate with their own independent dynamics. Anarchists see all liberation movements by oppressed people as fundamentally legitimate, be they "<a href="../../../p/r/o/Proletarians.html" title="Proletarians">proletarians</a>", "<a href="../../../p/e/a/Peasants.html" title="Peasants">peasants</a>", or others, without needing to fit these movements into a predetermined schema for <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolution.html" title="Revolution">revolution</a>. However, this position is not the only one throughout the anarchist movement, many anarchists believe that single issue struggles are extremely limited in their scope although they participate (as Marxists do) in them, trying to advance their positions and methods in an anarchist way.</p>
<p>Marxists tend to view people as sharing a certain <a href="../../../c/l/a/Class_consciousness.html" title="Class consciousness">class consciousness</a> based on their station in capitalist society. They believe that people share a collective socio-economic mindset and that freedom comes from liberating the class of it's class status shackles, thus eventually empowering the individual. Anarchists on the other hand tend to view people as social individuals who share a common condition in capitalist society, but don't necessarily share a uniform class consciousness. They believe that freedom comes from empowering the individual to free themself of subordination and obedience to hierarchical and authoritarian forces, thus encouraging individuals to freely associate with each other collectively.</p>
<p>Religion is another area of disagreement amongst Anachists and Marxists. Marxists view religion as an instrument of the bourgeoisie to dominate the minds of the lower classes and inspire subserviance to authority and acceptance of the status quo in return for promises of future reward. Anarchists agree with this analysis, but do not believe that all religions inherently function off of this. Marxists tend to envision a stateless communist society as being free of religion, sometimes promoting violence against clergy and religious institutions. While Anarchists sometimes promote violence against certain oppressive and authoritarian religious institutions, anarchism has historically been more accepting of personal spirituality and egalitarian religions. Anarchism has also historically gained much more support amongst religious communities and at various times and places explicitly anarchist forms of christianity, buddhism, hindhuism, and other religions have claimed tens of thousands of members. Some Anarchists envision future society as being free of religion while others envision future society as still having egalitarian religions and open free spirituality.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_and_Marxism_d262.html" title="Edit section: Relationship with Indigenous Peoples and Stateless Nations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Relationship with Indigenous Peoples and Stateless Nations</span></h2>
<p>Anarchism and Marxism differ sharply in their relationships with <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indigenous.html" title="Indigenous">indigenous</a> peoples and <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_minorities.html" title="National minorities">national minorities</a>. Early in the history of both movements thinkers from Marx to Bakunin to Kropotkin predicted that the coming revolution would wipe away all distinctions of nationality, that the workers of the world have no "nation", and that the natural form for socialism was <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internationalism.html" title="Internationalism">internationalism</a> that neither acknowledged or respected boundaries. This remained the established position of the entire anti-capitalist left up until the early 1900's and still holds considerable sway in both anarchist and Marxist circles.</p>
<p>During the build-up to the Russian revolution, however, Lenin and the Bolsheviks found it convenient to promise independence to the various indigenous non-Russian national minorities, notably the <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukrainians.html" title="Ukrainians">Ukrainians</a> and the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poles.html" title="Poles">Poles</a>, in return for their support against the Czarist empire. Once in power those promises were broken and nationalist movements throughout Russia and later the USSR were brutally crushed by Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin, and all their successors until the collapse of the USSR as a political unit. In the run-up to WWII the Russia's foreign policy centered around the idea of <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Bolshevism_a17e.html" title="National Bolshevism">National Bolshevism</a>, through which the Bolshevik political elite in Russia sought to instigate and support communist-nationalist revolutions around the world, most notably in Hungary and Germany, and then absorb the newly independent areas into a Soviet commonwealth - a goal that was achieved after WWII with the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warsaw_Pact_810c.html" title="Warsaw Pact">Warsaw Pact</a>. The failure of an attempted National Bolshevik rising in Germany in 1939 crippled the German left, paving the way for the Nazi's rise to power and the fallout from the failed operation was critical in allowing Stalin to seize power and expel or murder his rivals. Elements of this persisted in Soviet foreign policy throughout the cold war and helped motivate support of nationalist and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-imperialist.html" title="Anti-imperialist">anti-imperialist</a> movements throughout the third world. Aid by Russia to the Chinese Communist Party during the Chinese revolution was driven by the same motivation, but once in power Mao refused to allow the USSR to control Chinese policy, leading to a break with Stalin that culminated in a brief war between the two powers. The same proccess would later play out in the relationship between Communist rulers in China and Vietnam.</p>
<p>During the Chinese revolution a parallel process occurred as <a href="../../../m/a/o/Mao_Zedong_ee10.html" title="Mao Zedong">Mao Zedong</a> and the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_Communist_Party_49fb.html" title="Chinese Communist Party">Chinese Communist Party</a> first promised independence and self-determination to all of China's many stateless nations, and then not only refused to deliver once the CCP's grip on power was solidified but actually invaded and annexed <a href="../../../t/i/b/Tibet.html" title="Tibet">Tibet</a>, which he regarded as a renegade province. Every successive Communist government throughout the world has followed this same pattern of first promising indigenous national minorities self-determination in order to gain their support and then actively opposing that self-determination once in power. In a nutshell, the general policy of Marxist governments from Lenin on has been to support revolution nationalism and the rights of indigenous groups in theory and to oppose it in practice. Most recently, the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandanistas.html" title="Sandanistas">Sandanistas</a> in <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicaragua.html" title="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a> were accused of carrying out campaigns of <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_cleansing.html" title="Ethnic cleansing">ethnic cleansing</a> against indigenous peoples in order to seize their land.</p>
<p><a href="../../../w/a/r/Ward_Churchill_c079.html" title="Ward Churchill">Ward Churchill</a> has gone so far as to argue in his essay on Marxism and Indigenism<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> that Marxism is inherently imperialist and racist in effect, if not in intent, because it is based on the idea of historical progress and industrialization as inevitable, and sees industrial proletarian-based societies as more "advanced" then other societies (particularly indigenous societies). Other scholars argue that the conflict has to do with the demands of running a State structure and argue that if the Bolsheviks had come to power in Poland (for example) instead of Russia they would have had to become Polish nationalists and would have bitterly opposed Russian attempts to dominate Poland. Seizing the Russian State, however, meant that they had to defend the interests of that State; and the rights of stateless nations thus became anathema.</p>
<p>The position of Anarchism is somewhat the reverse. Most Anarchists, both historically and up to the present day, see borders and national divisions as detrimental and envision a world in which distinctions of <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race.html" title="Race">race</a> and <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnicity.html" title="Ethnicity">ethnicity</a> fade and dissapear over time as the ideal. In practice, however, Anarchism is based on small-scale systems of self-determination, local self-governance, and mutual aid that fulfill the desire of national minorities for self-determination on a de facto basis; and has thus been historically compatible with anti-state forms of <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalism.html" title="Nationalism">nationalism</a>. The most notable collaboration, of course, being the movements for self-rule by the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catalan_people.html" title="Catalan people">Catalans</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basque_people.html" title="Basque people">Basques</a> in Spain which found expression under the banner of the anarchist <a href="../../../c/n/t/CNT_ae46.html" title="CNT">CNT</a> during the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Civil_War_7a30.html" title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a>. More recently there has been an attempt at an explicit fusion of Anarchism and native-American political traditions manifested in the modern Indigenist movement. Anti-State nationalist organizations that explicitly describe their politics as Anarchist currently exist in <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> and Bretony. Many members of the modern <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Indian_Movement_ab84.html" title="American Indian Movement">American Indian Movement</a> also consider themselves Anarchists.</p>

<p>Marxism uses a form of analysis of human societies called "<a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_materialism.html" title="Historical materialism">historical materialism</a>." At the crux of historical materialist analysis is the idea that people find themselves in a predetermined material world, and act to produce changes upon that world within the limits of what changes they can conceive of. More specifically, the fundamental economic <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relations_of_production.html" title="Relations of production">relations of production</a> are the driving force of history, explaining phenomena in the "<a href="../../../s/u/p/Superstructure.html" title="Superstructure">superstructural</a>" ideological and legal realms, at least in the long run. Underlying these processes is the idea that <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contradictions.html" title="Contradictions">contradictions</a> and opposed <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_groups.html" title="Social groups">social groups</a> will naturally form and drive social progress.</p>
<p>Marx derived his formulation of historical materialism from the earlier German philosopher <a href="../../../h/e/g/Hegel.html" title="Hegel">Hegel</a>'s system of <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialectics.html" title="Dialectics">dialectics</a>. This method works from the assumptions that any natural phenomenon is defined through contrast with other phenomena, that quantities can be viewed qualitatively, that precise understanding of imprecise phenomena is possible (comparable to many physical uncertainty principles). Marx and his coworker <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedrich_Engels_f952.html" title="Friedrich Engels">Friedrich Engels</a> "turned Hegel on his head" and argued that these methods could be applied to human society in the form of historical materialism, so that classes can be studied by using contrast between, for example, owner and worker, or by taking quantities to make qualities, such as translating uneven distribution of private property to show class disparity.</p>
<p>Anarchists use a wide variety of tools of social analysis and some anarchists see value in historical materialism as a tool for social analysis. The Irish <a href="../../../w/o/r/Workers_Solidarity_Movement_861f.html" title="Workers Solidarity Movement">Workers Solidarity Movement</a>, for instance, makes agreeing with the historical materialist method's value a central point of unity. Most anarchists, however, dismiss historical materialism as a pseudo-science based on untestable and unfalsifiable universal claims. Anarchists were among the first to criticise the dialectical materialist trend on this basis, and on the basis that it dehumanises social and political analysis and is not sustainable as a universal methodology.</p>

<p>A simple interpretation of historical materialism suggests that if Marxism is right about the class forces operating in capitalism, a successful working-class revolution is inevitable. Some Marxists, notably the leaders of the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_International_3abe.html" title="Second International">Second International</a> in the late 19th and early 20th century, have believed this. However, the degree to which the revolution must be made by conscious forces has always been a matter of dispute among Marxists, with many arguing that Marx' famous statement that "I am not a Marxist" was a rejection of determinism, and the split was sharpened by the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_World_War_31c9.html" title="First World War">First World War</a>, when the social democratic parties of the Second International supported their respective nations' war efforts. Many Marxist opponents of the war, such as <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosa_Luxemburg_f445.html" title="Rosa Luxemburg">Rosa Luxemburg</a>, blamed the Second International's "betrayal" partly on its doctrine of the inevitability of socialism, which justified its attempt to reform existing capitalist states. Luxemburg put the alternatives for the future, instead, as "socialism or barbarism."</p>
<p>Since most anarchists reject dialectics and <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_materialism.html" title="Historical materialism">historical materialism</a>, anarchists do not claim that revolution and the reorganization of society are inevitable, only that they are desirable.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Workingmen%27s_Association_361b.html" title="International Workingmen's Association">International Workingmen's Association</a> (the First International), at its founding, was an alliance of socialist groups, including both anarchists and Marxists. Both sides had a common aim and common enemies. But each was critical of the other, and the inherent conflict between the two groups soon embodied itself in an ongoing argument between <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mikhail_Bakunin_11a1.html" title="Mikhail Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</a>, representative of anarchist ideas, and <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Marx_3bcc.html" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a> himself. In <a href="../../../1/8/7/1872.html" title="1872">1872</a>, the conflict in the First International climaxed with the expulsion of Bakunin and those who had become known as the "Bakuninists" when they were outvoted by the Marx party at the <a href="../../../h/a/g/Hague_Congress_%281872%29_b1e7.html" title="Hague Congress (1872)">Hague Congress</a>.</p>

<p>In the late 19th and early 20th century, many Marxists and anarchists were united within <a href="../../../s/y/n/Syndicalist.html" title="Syndicalist">syndicalist</a> movements for militant revolutionary <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_union.html" title="Trade union">trade unions</a>, such as the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_Workers_of_the_World_366b.html" title="Industrial Workers of the World">Industrial Workers of the World</a> (the Wobblies). The IWW was formed by the combination of Marxist trade union activists influenced by the <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_Leonist_dccc.html" title="De Leonist">De Leonist</a> ideas of the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist_Labor_Party_%28USA%29_821c.html" title="Socialist Labor Party (USA)">Socialist Labor Party (USA)</a> with a number of anarchist and syndicalist activists. Anarchists and Marxists cooperated successfully in the IWW until the 1920s when, acting under direction from Lenin and the Bolshevick government in Moscow, most of the comminists in the union deserted it and moved en masse to join the more mainstream labor movement.</p>

<p>Both anarchists and Marxists participated in the overthrow of the <a href="../../../t/s/a/Tsar.html" title="Tsar">Tsar</a> in <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_Revolution_4f8b.html" title="February Revolution">February 1917</a> in the beginning stages of the <a href="../../../1/9/1/1917_Russian_Revolution_e1db.html" title="1917 Russian Revolution">1917 Russian Revolution</a>. However, a hostile relationship quickly developed between anarchists and <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolsheviks.html" title="Bolsheviks">Bolsheviks</a>, so that anarchists generally opposed the Bolshevik-initiated transfer of power from the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provisional_Government_df55.html" title="Provisional Government">Provisional Government</a> to the Bolshevik commissars (acting on behalf of Bolshevik-led workers councils), in <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_Revolution_dcce.html" title="October Revolution">October 1917</a>. Even the ensuing civil war pitting the Bolshevik government and Red Army against the Tsarist <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_Armies_ca19.html" title="White Armies">White Armies</a> did not reconcile anarchists and Bolsheviks; although the Revolutionary Insurgent Army of the Ukraine, led by anarchists, fought counter-revolutionary forces only to be suppressed by Red Army leader Trotsky afterwards (because they refused to join the Red Army and accept Bolshevik authority); anarchists were involved in a series of <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_Russian_Revolution_57b7.html" title="Third Russian Revolution">violent uprisings</a> against the Bolshevik-led government in 1918 arguing for free soviets, freedom of expression and association, the end of war communism and the establishment of free communes on the basis of voluntary association. Most of Russian anarchists were imprisoned and their press silenced, leaving only token freedom to the least menacing sectors. At the end of the civil war, sailors at <a href="../../../k/r/o/Kronstadt_Rebellion_a7d3.html" title="Kronstadt Rebellion">Kronstadt</a> influenced by anarchists mutinied, demanding more political and economical liberties while defending socialism and workers democracy, and were violently crushed by the Bolshevik <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Army_ccba.html" title="Red Army">Red Army</a>.
