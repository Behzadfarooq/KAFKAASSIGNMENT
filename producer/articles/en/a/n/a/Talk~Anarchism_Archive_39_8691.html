<h2><span class="mw-headline">Another Suggestion</span></h2>
<p>Thanks for making those changes, Sarge. Now, one more concern: the phrasing <i>"the 20th century saw the formulation of the contentious anarcho-capitalism."</i></p>
<p>The adjective "contentious" seems to modify "anarcho-capitalism" rather than whether anarcho-capitalism is really anarchism. This would likely imply to new readers that there is something internal to anarcho-capitalism causing dispute. What we really mean, of course, is that there is a dispute about whether anarcho-capitalism qualifies as anarchism - quite a different thing. One could properly talk about, e.g. contentious <i>propaganda of the deed</i>, since prop of the deed involves violence and contention, but not anarcho-capitalism, if you catch my drift. Would you clarify <i>what contentious is modifying</i> by changing it to something like: <i>the 20th century saw a contentious/disputed/controversial</i> (take your pick) <i>formulation of anarchism called anarcho-capitalism</i>?</p>
<p>Further tweaking it: the word "capitalism" itself is, as you know, defined differently by different people, and has changed considerably over time. So why not specify what is different about this formulation? In particular, inserting the word "pro-market" (or "modern pro-market" to distinguish it from older Individualist Anarchist pro-market notions) explains even better. Thus we now have, <i>the 20th century saw a contentious, modern pro-market formulation called anarcho-capitalism.</i></p>
<p>IMO the last one is best, most precise, etc. But at a minimum the adjective "contentious" should be moved, as in the first suggestion.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalism</a> should be a link, since it is the first occurance. Finally, what's with the double reference to Encarta in the same sentence? The "and to this day" seems gratuitous, and can be omitted. Thus we have:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Anarchism traditionally and popularly is described as anti-capitalist<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>, though the 20th century saw a contentious, modern pro-market formulation called <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalism</a>.</dd>

<dd>Well, I agree the wording is poor. I don't know about "the rise" (since it suggests it's older), and "modern pro-market" is confusing. How about "although the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a> saw the formulation of a contentious <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_market.html" title="Free market">free market</a> philosophy called <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalism</a>"?

<dd>No problem. It's not like we're actively sitting here trying to figure out how to marginalize your POV. I'm very open (maybe too open) to compromise and cooperate and find fair solutions. But this really just isn't the best article to jump into and rewrite whole sections unilaterally. That's really the main thing that bothers people. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 02:40, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sarge, you've been very accomodating, and you're not my personal secretary, so there's no need for you to make the following edits. Most are relatively minor, and can wait until protection is lifted. Meanwhile, discussion is invited.</p>
<ul>
<li>Somewhere along the line, the translation of <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archon.html" title="Archon">archon</a> was changed from "ruler" to "chief." "Ruler" is a more precise translation - the one given here in Wikipedia.</li>
<li><b>Origins and predecessors</b> can be trimed. In the second sentence, "Following classical socialist theory" is gratuitous; the claim following is not part of classical socialist theory (esp for statist socialists), and can easily (and usually is) supported without reference to socialism. The first sentence about Kropotin's book is relevant, but it shouldn't be the lead sentence since, without previous explanation, it doesn't seem to relate to the section title. Also, "tribal societies" should be changed to "hunter-gatherer societies" to make it clear we are not speaking of e.g. modern Cherokees in Oklahoma that live consumerist American lifestyles, run casinos, and get govt aid for being indians. I would stike the egalitarian claim since many feminists would reject most such societies as paternalistic; besides, the relative equality of resources implies a degree of egalitarianism anyway. I suggest modifying the first paragraph to:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Anarchists argue that the <a href="../../../s/t/a/State.html" title="State">State</a> is not a natural phenomenon, and that hunter-gatherer societies lacked <a href="../../../d/i/v/Division_of_labour.html" title="Division of labour">division of labour</a>, accumulated wealth, decreed <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law.html" title="Law">law</a>, and had relatively equal access to resources.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> In <i><a href="../../../a/_/f/Mutual_Aid%7E_A_Factor_of_Evolution_170d.html" title="Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution">Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution</a></i>, <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Kropotkin_48a3.html" title="Peter Kropotkin">Peter Kropotkin</a> argued that mutual aid was a natural feature of animal and human relations.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>In the second paragraph of the same section, replace "earlier" (than what?) with "pre-modern" or "ancient."</li>
<li>The Proudhon section is very redundant, e.g. it says he opposes capitalism six times, and that doesn't include his direct quotes, or descriptions of mutualism which clearly show incompatability with capitalism. It smacks of an editorial agenda, or overreaction, or defensiveness. Since "capitalism" is such a connotative and disputed term, I'd hack out most references to the "C" word and let Proudhon's explanations of possession and mutualism speak for themselves.</li>
<li>In the <b>Other issues</b> section, the <b>Anti-Racism, Anti-Fascism, and Anti-Oppression</b> subsection, the second half of the paragraph should be deleted, starting with "Anti-Racist Action is not an anarchist group..." (Neither is Zapatista, strictly speaking, and anarcha-feminism is already covered.) Cut, trim, snip.</li>
<li>The whole Cultural Phenomena section can go. If someone is really attached to it, they can make it a separate article, with a See Also link in this one.</li>
<li>Probably that book they use in college philosophy courses, "In Defense of Anarchism," should be included in the book section. It's really pretty good, and academically respectable.</li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">UK encart article does not say what is claimed</span></h2>
<p>It does not say anarchism was "traditionally anti-capitalist". It should be changed so that the article claims the source says it was originally associated with socialism and communism. Also, why does the article say "contentious anarcho-capitalism". Like anarchism isn't contentious.

<dd>Well you know, anarcho-capitalism is a little too radical for most anarchists. Anything too far out of the supposed "mainstream" makes them uncomfortable. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 04:22, 12 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure I see what's so radical about it. It's just a consistent form of libertarian capitalism. Radicalism means wanting major changes. Anarcho-capitalism hardly wants to change anything. It thinks things are pretty good. Hell, most anarcho-capitalists think they can get where they want to go through voting. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 04:28, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

The short 1 page US Encarta (ref 2) says the anarchism is "basically anticapitalist." The three page UK encarta (ref 1) says about individualist anarchism: "Since World War II this tradition has been reborn and modified in the United States as anarcho-capitalism." Neither refers to ancap as contentious. So the sentence in the intro should be changed from:</p>

<p>We could consolidate much of the stuff into one section. As it is we get incomplete descriptions of Proudhon's views on the subject, and then later Tucker's views, and then later Kropotkin's views, etc. Bringing these together would help readers see the recurring themes in each system. Also, the text doesn't explain possession very well. Finally, the 'Theory of Property' from what excepts I have available, seems closer to Georgism than to propertarianism in the usual sense. Jacob Haller 14:45, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You are right - <i>possession</i> is not explained very well at all. In the Proudhon section, the explanation given is confusing and contradictory. (But Proudhon may have liked that!). As BillyBong suggested above, the whole Proudhon section needs to be revamped. Maybe there needs to be a sidebar explaining the similarities and differences between private property and possession as mutualists use the terms. Or simply include a short explanation in the Proudhon section. E.g. <i>Proudhon used the term "possession" to refer to a variant of private property in which ownership required continuous possession and/or use. In his early writings, he used "property" to mean ownership failing to satisfy the continued use provision.</i> - Faithless
<dl>
<dd>We ought to avoid using one word (property) in two very different senses. Like 'wage labor' 'private property' can cause confusion. I'm not sure how to set up tables here, but perhaps one listing different viewpoints (Proudhon's, Tucker's, and various modern groupings), their standards for legit ownership, their terminology for legit ownership (possession or property for Proudhon, possession for most modern anarchists) and their terminology for illegitimate ownership (property for Proudhon and for most modern anarchists). Another approach would focus on the basic rationales for these systems; to preserve economic autonomy ('property is freedom') including equal access, to reflect a right of individuals to the products of their labor, to reflect a right of individuals to the requirements of life, etc. Jacob Haller 00:31, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is interesting stuff, but to my mind we already go into too much depth on it in an article that is overlong. I would actually trim all but the barest references to theories of property out of this page, and suggest people who are interested in the subject work on it in other pages. The details of Proudhon's theory in the Proudhon page, more general and comparative stuff in pages on theories of property in general, or perhaps on a new page about anarchist theories of property. Or maybe the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchist_economics.html" title="Anarchist economics">anarchist economics</a> page.<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBengalski_c6f3.html" title="User:Bengalski">Bengalski</a> 19:15, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I have an idea. What if we, when at all possible, use some specifying adjective with the ambiguous terms. For example, instead of simply "property" when we are using it in the mutualist/socialist <i>illegitimate type of ownership</i> sense, we use the term "allodial property." Instead of "capitalism" in its <i>not legitimate according to socialism</i> sense, we use the term "statist capitalism." Instead of capitalism in its <i>legitimate according to anarcho-capitalism</i> sense, we use the term "stateless capitalism." Then we go through the article and specify wherever such terms stand alone. This would not increase article length except for the few specifying adjectives, so Bengalski's and SargeBaldy's concerns are hopefully addressed.<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveRwanda_d22f.html" title="User:SteveRwanda">SteveRwanda</a> 20:15, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>I'm not so keen on this. As far as I understand it 'allodial property' is a very specific legal term, and I'm far from convinced that Proudhon or any other anarchist writer on property was much concerned with this narrow legal concept. I don't see where introducing 'statist/stateless capitalism' would help the article.

On Proudhon I'd propose this: give a bare statement using his own terms in the first para, cut out all other discussion of the theory, and refer the interested reader elsewhere. Eg something like this:</p>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon_876a.html" title="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a> is commonly regarded as the first self-proclaimed anarchist, a label he adopted in his groundbreaking work <i><a href="../../../w/h/a/What_is_Property__14d1.html" title="What is Property?">What is Property?</a></i>, published in 1840. It is for this reason that some claim Proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> Proudhon developed the theory of <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spontaneous_order.html" title="Spontaneous order">spontaneous order</a> in society, where organization emerges without a central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests; his famous quote on the matter is, "Liberty is the mother, not the daughter, of order."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In <i>What is Property?</i> Proudhon answers with the famous accusation "<a href="../../../p/r/o/Property_is_theft.html" title="Property is theft">Property is theft</a>." In this work he opposed the institution of "property" (propriété), as he understood the term, but supported an alternative form of ownership he called "possession". Proudhon's theory of property is highly complex, and its interpretation the subject of much debate. <i>(See XXX for more detail.)</i><a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBengalski_c6f3.html" title="User:Bengalski">Bengalski</a> 22:13, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>By my partial reading, he uses use/possession as the basic theory with original production as a second test for produced goods and geoism as a second test for land. He changes his terminology, using property in the sense of possession, but not his position. Jacob Haller 04:11, 14 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, he changed his position. As the source in the article says, he eventually "came to consider that liberty could be guaranteed only if property ownership was not subject to any limitation save that of size" He even allowed land to be inherited. The source says he "reverses his earlier preferences for 'possession' rather than 'property' as a form of ownership, arguing instead that the individual must be absolutely sovereign over his own land."

<p>I hope that one (shorter, clearer) subsection can replace the (long, scattered) references in the individual subsections. Even if not (1) the critique of (presently-existing) property represent one of the starting points for anarchist theory (2) and often one of the distinguishing features between anarchist theories. I now agree with the two-word suggestion, i.e. possession, (possession) property, (geoist) property, (Lockean) property, (feudal) property, (non-possession) property, etc. This could work even without moving everything. Jacob Haller 04:11, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Were the changes to the Proudhon section necessary, appropriate, or discussed above? Anyway, check 'General Idea of the Revolution in the 19th Century' pp. 260-261 (or Edwards and Fraser p. 73). Proudhon distinguishes between (feudal) property and possession/(possessive) property, even if he first called the latter 'possession' and later called it 'property.'

<dd>I like it as well, and think it lays things out better (with a movement section, followed by one for individualism, and then one for issues). It's less cluttered. And I don't feel it downplays anarcho-capitalism, as if there's any word to describe a/c's place within anarchism, it's "disputed". Putting it against anarchism's long opposition to capitalism doesn't seem unfair to me, it seems to put things more into perspective. It's also a lot slimmer, which would be a nice change. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 21:09, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I prefer the issue-based style as well. I think it works better to look at "capitalism" and say what different anarchists have had to say about it rather than looking at each different group of anarchists and saying what they had to say about each specific issue. There's too much overlap to look at individual traditions. There's movements and history, and then there's specific issues. And that's all we should be concerned with. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 22:39, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We've had this way of organizing the article before, with main sections: Precursors, Socialist/Workers/Communist and Individualist/Liberal.

<dd>No, anarcho-capitalism does not belong in the intro. The overwhelming current of anarchist thought and practice has been fundamentally anti-capitalist.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Capitalism vs. capitalism... common ground?</span></h2>
<p>Is the capitalism supported by Anarcho-capitalists the same capitalism that non-a-c anarchists oppose? Don't members of both groups oppose state supported capitalism, which is modern day capitalism? I mean, in a truly anarchist free market, would we have the giant multi-national powerful capitalist corporations that we have today? Or are they creations supported and subsidized by the government infrastructure equally opposed by all types of anarchists? In other words, are anacaps and "traditional" anarchists really different in their beliefs? When anarchists say they oppose capitalism, what <i>exactly</i> do they oppose? What kind of capitalism do the anacaps support? Could there be more common ground here than many realize? --<a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerge_Issakov_7435.html" title="User:Serge Issakov">Serge</a> 06:28, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes. Anarchists oppose capitalism, regardless of whether it's tied to the state, because it's seen as inherently exploitative and hierarchical. But then, anarchists not only have a problem with the capitalism of a/c, but also that it supports the existence of many other authoritarian institutions anarchism has long fought against, such as police forces, military, organized religion, bureaucracies, and just about anything else. In fact, all anarcho-capitalists really are interested in is the privatization of the state, not its elimination. Which is pretty far out from any "traditional" anarchist perspective. So no, there really isn't any common ground. Sad as it is to say, trying to reconcile traditional anarchism with anarcho-capitalism is about as easy as trying to reconcile it with the state. (And that's speaking as someone who was a longtime libertarian capitalist and anarcho-capitalist.) <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 06:43, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But how does one prevent capitalism from occuring naturally without resorting to a state to control it? Capitalism, ultimately, is simply the free trade of goods and labor, is it not? If a baker wants to hire help, what's to prevent him from doing so in a hypothetical traditional anarchist society? What if he's successful, and opens multiple bakeries, hiring more and more people? At some point (if not when he buys his first pound of flour or sells his first loaf of bread), he is a capitalist. How do "traditional anarchists" prevent such capitalism from flourishing if not with the power of the state? And if they do prevent natural capitalism from flourishing with the power of the state, how are they anarchists?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, is privatization of the state not its elimination? I mean, how is a privatized state a state? That is, if individuals are paying for various "traditional state" services (water, streets, police, fire, etc.) directly (or collectively through contracts entered voluntarily, such as part of a home owner's association), where is "the state"? Is it not eliminated when it is so privatized? In the Soviet Union, milk production and distribution was a state service. In capitalist societies this function is privatized. Does not the privatization of this service eliminate the state, at least with respect to that service? Wouldn't that be true for any state function that is privatized in an a-c society? If all state functions were privatized, would that not eliminate the state? If not, how would it be manifisted? --<a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerge_Issakov_7435.html" title="User:Serge Issakov">Serge</a> 07:40, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you assume too much that capitalism arises up naturally if there is no authoritarian force there to "squelch" it. On the contrary, depending on how you organize society, capitalism and competition might be completely nonsensical. That's the whole point. It's not about simply throwing out the state, and making a few tinkers, it's about radically reorganizing society in such a way that it is no longer compatible with a capitalist economic structure. That means eliminating currency, eliminating surplus, eliminating anything that poses a threat to egalitarian relations. Designing a society in which capitalism makes no sense. It's not hard to dig around and find societies that are organized this way. For example, the Piaroa <a href="http://www.peacefulsocieties.org/Society/Piaroa.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.peacefulsocieties.org/Society/Piaroa.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and the Paliyans <a href="http://www.peacefulsocieties.org/Society/Paliyans.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.peacefulsocieties.org/Society/Paliyans.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> both see competition as leading to the breakdown of the order and individuality they value.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The thing with anarcho-capitalism is, they want all the functions of government, they even want laws, they want police, they want formalized education, they want a military. They want everything the state has to offer, except maybe taxes or the draft. That works as a consistent version of social contract theory or classic liberalism but hardly fits well into the anarchist tradition, which has criticized the control of individuals in all institutions. Anarchists weren't simply opposed to the state as a formal legal entity, but also to each and every one of its functions. Anarcho-capitalists by contrast believe very deeply in what the state has to offer, but just don't like the idea of the state as a monopoly, and think corporations can do a better job competing over each of the functions.</dd>

<dd>Anarcho-capitalists believe in private police forces who legally enforce capitalism, which just shows how unstable it is on its own. Other anarchists don't believe in "enforcing" an anti-capitalist economic system, because they see that as non-anarchist. But if they did, if they had police forces that controlled capitalism, beating people with a stick for trying to sell things, that would be the mirror of anarcho-capitalism – in which you beat people for taking "private property" – and essentially just as anarchist, or just as non-anarchist, as the case might be. On the contrast, anarchists believe in a system that works without having to restort back to authoritarian social controls. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 08:34, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are confusing free trade with capitalism. You can have capitalism without free trade or free trade without capitalism or you could have both or neither. Basicly anarchists view capitalism as other -isms like racism (opression based on race), sexism (opression based on gender), thus capitalism is opression based on financial status. // <a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELiftarn_fddd.html" title="User:Liftarn">Liftarn</a></dd>

<dd>I am not prepared to concede that I'm confused, but I will admit that I do not see a distinction between capitalism and free trade. That traditional anarchists "see" capitalism as oppressive does not mean it is, nor that it is anything other than free trade. Trade that is truly free among human individuals who differ in drive, personality, values, skills, natural talent, family/personal support, creativity, intelligence, work ethic, etc. will inevitably and necessarily lead to differences in material status between individuals. The greater the population in which free trade is engaged, the greater the largest difference in material status is to be expected. In a village of a few dozen people, that has limited to no trading with others, the differences between the richest and the poorest can be expected to be relatively small. In a free market with over 5 billion participants, the richest will inevitably have substantially more financial status than the poorest. With free trade, this is inevitable. Whether the negotiation advantages and disadvantages enabled by differences in material/financial status constitutes "oppression", or even something we should try to avoid, is a matter of opinion. But even if you wanted to avoid it, I don't see how you could except to inhibit free trade by force. --<a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerge_Issakov_7435.html" title="User:Serge Issakov">Serge</a> 16:27, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sarge Baldy: "The thing with anarcho-capitalism is, they want all the functions of government, they even want laws, they want police, they want formalized education, they want a military."</p>
<p>This seems to conflate <i>services</i> with <i>function of government</i>. Surely even anarcho-socialists don't want to be mugged or killed, and want to exercise their right to possession property (or to take according to their needs, as the case may be.) Ansocs might do this spontaneously, or have a mutual association or co-op to provide this type of security service. I don't see why a <i>firm</i> that provides such a service is a State, but a mutual or co-op that provides it isn't.</p>
<p>Just because something is a service currently provided by the State doesn't mean that it is not valuable to people. Education, for example, is usually provided by the State, but clearly would not cease to be of value in a stateless society.</p>
<p>Sarge Baldy: "If they [anarcho-socialists] had police forces that controlled capitalism, beating people with a stick for trying to sell things, that would be the mirror of anarcho-capitalism – in which you beat people for taking private property..."</p>
<p>You seem to be assuming a monopoly here - that these free-market police forces are enforcing a property system on everyone instead of just those who choose their services. Panarchists, anarchists-with-no-adjectives, and ancaps see it as enforcing contracts only in the jurisdiction of those who have voluntarily joined. So yes, if a capitalist goes into an anarcho-communist neighborhood/jurisdiction and hires someone, he may get beaten; if an anti-property communist anarchist goes into an anarcho-capitalist jurisdiction and helps himself to goods, he may get beaten. In either case, the beating may be spontaneous or organized, by individuals or groups. Where's the State?</p>
<p>Sarge Baldy: "I think you assume too much that capitalism arises up naturally if there is no authoritarian force there to "squelch" it. On the contrary, depending on how you organize society, capitalism and competition might be completely nonsensical."</p>
<p>I don't see how you're going to "organize society" to make stateless capitalism nonsensical without using authority. Anarcho-socialists seem to lack any explanation here, and come off as naive and utopian.</p>
<p>My take on the <b>common ground</b>: Both anarcho-capitalists and anarcho-socialists are against the State. Both are against statist capitalism. The disagreement is about stateless capitalism, i.e. the voluntary acceptance of private property, free markets, and employment. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickedWanda_155d.html" title="User:WickedWanda">WickedWanda</a> 17:14, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>All four terms are ambiguous. For classical anarchists 'capitalism' describes the hierarchies rooted in state power, land monopolies, credit monopolies, and other capital monopolies. Also, some anarchists use 'markets' to describe (voluntary or involuntary) commodity exchange, while others use 'markets' to describe 'the sum of all voluntary human relations.'</dd>
<dd>The question is whether, absent state power and capital monopolies, people expect market exchanges to take hierarrchical or non-hierarchical forms. Jacob Haller 04:49, 23 June 2006 (UTC) [correcting accidental logout]</dd>

<dd>I guess you're right; it says "Those activists who identify with anarchism are usually anti-capitalist; among these, some would also call themselves socialists (presumably of the libertarian variety), some would not." but that's talking specifically about people opposed to neoliberalism. Although I would say I find it literally insane that anyone could think anarcho-capitalists "outnumber" traditional anarchists, especially since anarchism has been growing everywhere in the last decade. It's hard to find a scholarly source saying that most anarchists are against capitalism, because that's the sort of thing people should already know from their intro to political science classes. Very often people write about anarchism without acknowledging the existence of anarcho-capitalism, whether because they believe it's negligible, not anarchism proper, or simply haven't heard of it. It's not hard to find statements from non-anarchists that go "Anarchists believe that human corruption results when differences are enforced through the maintenance of property and authority." (<i>The Anarchist in the Library</i>, <a href="../../../s/i/v/Siva_Vaidhyanathan_65fc.html" title="Siva Vaidhyanathan">Siva Vaidhyanathan</a>) Likewise, the Library of Congress excludes books about anarcho-capitalism from the HX category (which is for "Socialism, communism, anarchism, utopias"). Seeing as the whole field of library science is dedicated to the categorization of information, it seems interesting that they decided anarcho-capitalism doesn't classify as anarchism.

<ul>
<li>The sentance "Another prominent anarcho-capitalist is David D. Friedman." looks thrown in out of the blue. I agree that Friedman is very important in the A/C tradition, but he needs to be worked into the article instead of stuck into the middle of it, know what I mean?</li>
<li>The last paragraph seesm to have some misconceptions that I'm not sure how to correct. For example it gives the impression that the NAP is inherantly an aspect of <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_Law_c1a6.html" title="Natural Law">Natural Law</a>. This is incorrect, there are plenty of pragmatist ancapists who perport the NAP as merely a guideline for facilitating the peaceful coopertation of individuals, not as some form of "natural law".</li>
<li>It also seems to have a strange misconception of the term <a href="../../../u/t/i/Utilitarianism.html" title="Utilitarianism">Utilitarianism</a>. Ancapists who use utilitarian arguments typically state that capitalism is better fit to provide for the needs of the individuals involved in that it generates wealth and hence utility.</li>

<dd>I haven't looked for links, but here is my understanding of the issue: Capitalism is based on private property. And private property can only exist as long as there is someone willing to use violence to enforce it. Historically, private property has been enforced by the state. Thus, capitalism has rested on state violence.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Ancaps want to replace the state with a collection of competing private institutions. But they still need "men with guns" to defend their social order.

<dd>Defending your body and external property, or paying someone to do it for you, does not make you a State. What would make you a State is that you force others to finance that protection --you tax --you <i>initiate</i> force. Support of private defense is not unique to anarcho-capitalists. Individualist anarchists in general support private defense of person and property. For individualists, using force in <i>defense</i> is consistent with anarchism. It's actually viewed as essential, because it's not a utopian doctrine --they don't expect people to all of a sudden stop having a proclivity to attack people and steal from people. So, there has to be defensive force in order to protect anarchy. 19th century individualist anarchist, Victor Yarros (not an anarcho-capitalist) explains, "<i>Anarchism means no government, but it does not mean no laws and no coercion. This may seem paradoxical, but the paradox vanishes when the Anarchist definition of government is kept in view. Anarchists oppose government, not because they disbelieve in punishment of crime and resistance to aggression, but because they disbelieve in compulsory protection. Protection and taxation without consent is itself invasion; hence Anarchism favors a system of voluntary taxation and protection.</i>" And, "<i>The anarchists, as anarchists, work directly, not for a perfect social state, but for a perfect political system. A perfect social state is a state totally free from sin or crime of folly; a perfect political system in which justice is observed, in which nothing is punished but crime and nobody coerced but invaders.</i>" Of course, anarcho-communists oppose such a thing. "While social anarchists seek to abolish the state as the source of private property, the individualists want to eliminate it because they see it as an obstacle to private property." (<i>Ulrike Heider, Anarchism: Left, Right, and Green</i>) All of the individualists support private defense of person and property, whether they're capitalist or not. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 03:00, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A source for that would have to be defining capitalism in its own idiosyncratic way. The common modern definition of capitalism doesn't indicate any such requirement: "<i>an economic system characterized by private or corporation ownership of capital goods, by investments that are determined by private decision rather than by state control, and by prices, production, and the distribution of goods that are determined mainly in a free market</i>" (Merriam-Webster Unabridged Dictionary). Whether property is protected by the state or privately is not relevant to the definition. Now some of the old individualist anarchists defined capitalism as the concentration of capital in the hands of a few brought about by state-enforced monopoly (such as forbidding competition in banking). According to them "capitalism," by that defintion would not exist if the state stopped interfering with competition. But, that's a pretty old/obscure definition of capitalism. And, they still believed in private ownership of capital and a market economy. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 03:21, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But, that spontaneous order is premised on individuals having the <i>freedom</i> to do what they want. Without that freedom, there is inefficiency and chaos. So unless there are "guns" protecting individual freedom, there is not going to be any spontaenous order unless you expect people to lose their taste for violence and aggressing against each other. I don't know what you're talking about "liberals" because liberalism is all about spontaneous order that comes about from people having the <i>freedom</i> to pursue their self-interest --from Proudhon, through Adam Smith (the invisible hand), on down through Rothbard.

<dd>The freedom to be free isn't compatible with the freedom to enslave people, to kill people, or to be hit with sticks by police.

You want the freedom to self interest; I want freedom from a bunch of self-interested vampires trying to exploit me, the freedom to clean air, the freedom from bureaucracy and capitalism and private property. Anarcho-capitalism doesn't allow those freedoms; if someone is shoving a gun down your throat for doing something, it's pretty evident you're not "free" to do it, no matter who the hell is holding the gun. I say "liberal" society to mean an atomized society where every person is seen as an enemy to every other person, who might use them to their own ends or compete against their interests, rather than one in which people have enough connection to other people they aren't liable to kill them or rape them or sell them out for a few bucks. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 04:27, 23 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well there we fall back to the "nature vs nurture" thing. I've taken enough criminology classes to know that people are much more a product of their environments than of their biological makeup. All the biological explanations are pretty much considered dead in the water. Biology has some role in predisposing people to behaviors, but under the right circumstances they won't act on them. I'm not very worried about "vicious animals", because I consider human nature dynamic and not static. Organize things properly, and even people with a biological predisposition won't act out. Look at the societies here <a href="http://www.peacefulsocieties.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.peacefulsocieties.org/" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> for some examples of how some groups have organized in ways in which violence didn't exist.

<dd>"Organize things properly"? That doesn't sound very anarchistic. In anarchy, there is no organizer. Organization emerges <i>inadvertently</i> under the condition of FIRST having liberty. Nothing can be organized, period, without first having the liberty to organize. Also, if people didn't have a biological predisposition to violence, then there would have been no one to cast the first punch. There would have been no one to institute the first State. Human nature hasn't changed one bit. States exist because it is in human nature to create states. Anarchists exists because it is in human nature to oppose States. There will always be the conflict between States and people wanting freedom from States. I think Proudhon eventually came to recognized this in his "antinomies" --anarchy is a "perpetual desideratum," he said. (And, by that time he had come to conclude that "private property" was necessary in order to protect the individual from the State having too much power over the individual). <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 05:10, 23 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What are you talking about? You can't have a system without "organizing". By "organizing" I mean the process by which you get from where we are to where we end up. Removing the state is "organizing". If removing the state is non-anarchist, then I have no idea what your plan is. I already said people have a biological predisposition to violence; and that that disposition can easily be overcome. I don't know, there's just no point arguing with someone who's already convinced himself that people fit into some narrow box. It's all just a complete tautology. It's hard to argue with someone when they're talking in circles. You can point out examples of societies who have never heard of violence or can't even comprehend the idea, or show how rates of violence differ wildly across the globe, but it doesn't mean anything when people choose to stick blindly to an unsupported biological ideology that complements every part of their entire world view. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 05:29, 23 June 2006 (UTC)

Sarge Baldy: "Organize things properly, and even people with a biological predisposition won't act out. ... Especially inciteful are the Paliyans and Piaroa."</p>
<p>Like RJII, I'm very suspicious of people wanting to "organize things properly." Sounds like imposed authority to me. I'd be more convinced if you could offer some <i>invisable hand process</i> applicable to modern society. The examples you cite concern hunter-gatherers, with the Piaroa adding some primitive agriculture. It worries me that it would take a plague or something wiping out 98% of the world population to implement. The strategies for avoiding violence in the cultures cited seem totally unworkable except in a primative hunter-gatherer scenerio - disappear into the woods for the Paliyans, belief in magic supernatural karma for the Piaroa. Sarge, are you a primitivist hoping for the vast majority of humankind to die off? <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickedWanda_155d.html" title="User:WickedWanda">WickedWanda</a> 05:59, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>And I find the idea of a police force the most obvious possible example of "imposed authority". In fact, anarcho-capitalism sounds about as fun as Stalinism to me. All systems have to be "organized", unless your system is complete chaos. The difference is, in anarchism the system is organized and then left alone, because it's seen as stable and working. In anarcho-capitalism, the system is never stable or working, so you have police forces making sure everything stays properly organized to the authoritarian tenets set up by the presidents of the individual states, er, I mean PDAs. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 06:06, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Many indigenous tribes were very stable for thousands of years. Thousands of years is stable enough for me, seeing as the only reason those societies broke apart was because of greedy colonial powers looking to exploit them. That's because those societies organized themselves in a way that was stable, sustainable, and orderly. There was no reason for them to change. Looking at the history of human life on the planet, societies that rapidly change are the oddball ones, the least stable ones, and the least sustainable ones. Not to mention the ones with the most anomie and violence. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 07:15, 23 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sarge, if you want a society that is totally pacifist, and runs away and hides in the woods when their rights get violated (like the Paliyans), then I can understand why you'd think organized self-defense is a state. But most anarchists are not pacifists, and most anarchists embrace technology and modern society. We are not willing to jettison science and go back to primitive superstition. I think most anarchists realize that personal or group defense of rights is not, ipso facto, a state. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickedWanda_155d.html" title="User:WickedWanda">WickedWanda</a> 08:14, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I guess this talk page tends to drift in that direction pretty naturally. I don't think it's so bad until it gets uncivil. It's better that it gets brought up here rather than in the article itself. Seeing as the largest debate in this article <i>regards</i> the degree to which much of the subject matter is appropriate, I don't think it's fair to say such dialogue doesn't belong on the talk page.

<dd>Can someone provide a link to the (or any) argument that capitalism can be maintained only by state violence? I'd like to see how that is formulated. --<a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerge_Issakov_7435.html" title="User:Serge Issakov">Serge</a> 23:35, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Serge,</p>
<p>First, recall the difference in emphasis between socialist and libertarian uses of the word 'capitalism'. See the citation of Wendy McElroy in <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-Capitalism_92ab.html" title="Anarcho-Capitalism">Anarcho-Capitalism</a> and the second paragraph of <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_and_capitalism.html" title="Anarchism and capitalism">anarchism and capitalism</a>. Socialists tend to mean 'presently-existing capitalism', while libertarians tend to mean the unrealized ideal of complete laissez-faire.</p>
<p>Second, the <i>citation needed</i> tag is entirely phoney. Three-quarters of the article is about anarchists who believe that abolition of the state necessarily entails the abolition of capital. If that isn't proof of the widespread belief that capitalism is maintained by state violence, I don't know what is.</p>
<p>But I draw your attention to the Anarchist faq, particularly the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/1931/secCcon.html" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/1931/secCcon.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/1931/secCcon.html</a></li>

</ul>
<p>There you will find the argument fleshed out more fully, with citations of historical anarchist thinkers.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I ask that the <sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> tag be removed. Also, I address the following appeal to my anarcho-capitalist friends: Please, before you edit the article again, take a little bit of time to read up on the historical anarchist movement. It is not, of course, required that Wikipedia editors actually <i>know</i> about the subjects they edit on, but it really does help smooth things out. <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBacchiad_744e.html" title="User:Bacchiad">Bacchiad</a> 07:07, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It looks like the problem's been solved with the insertion of <i>as they understand the term</i>.

<p>So socialists use "capitalism" to mean presently-existing capitalism, "while libertarians tend to mean the unrealized ideal of complete laissez-faire."</p>
<p>That strikes me as an incomplete categorization. Libertarians use "capitalism" as the name of an ideal <i>and</i> as the name of those forces within the present world that may in the fullness of time bring that ideal into reality. It is a way of identifying with the liquidated kulaks of the past, the burdened entrepreneurs of the present, as well as of the better world that will neither burden nor liquidate such productive folk in the future.

<p>Whatever.

<dd>Right. Socialists tend to conflate statist capitalism and market capitalism, whereas libertarians are quite keen on the distinction.

<p>When asked whether he considers himself an anarchist he says: "I consider myself to be an indigenist and that would be somewhat related to anarchism, we have a lot of common ground in terms of understanding - we can communicate, we can work in alliance fairly easily." (Barbara Bovine interview).</p>
<p>In one of his <a href="../../../c/o/i/COINTELPRO_b137.html" title="COINTELPRO">COINTELPRO</a> talks he has vaunted the (up to) 1920's <a href="../../../i/w/w/IWW_6770.html" title="IWW">IWW</a> and "..how would the history of the United States have developed if an anarcho-syndicalist movement with a highly developed political conscienceness and an agenda in effective tactics had not been obliterated by the mass trial of it's leadership in 1919 but had ultimately evolved and grown, according to it's own dynamics and it's own ability to articulate it's message to the public at large - what would the nature of the US labour movement have looked like, what would the work relations in American workplaces look like, how would it be different from the way it is now. I think you can probably connect those dots and trace it out in such a way to understand that things would be very very different and in a very, very positive form than the way things are now...

<dd>So he says that things would be very, very postive compared to today if an anarcho-syndicalist organization had not been virtually destroyed.

Not the bomb-in-the-pocket stuff, which is terrorism, whatever name it tries to dignify itself with, not the social-Darwinist economic 'libertarianism' of the far right; but anarchism, as prefigured in early Taoist thought, and expounded by Shelley and Kropotkin, Goldman and Goodman. Anarchism's principal target is the authoritarian State (capitalist or socialist); its principle moral-practical theme is cooperation (solidarity, mutual aid). It is the most idealistic, and to me the most interesting, of all political theories.'</dd>

<dd>The movement against neoliberal globalization is called that because it encompasses a wide variety of groups, including farmers, trade unionists, socialists, and so on. It isn't called the anti-capitalist movement because it's only opposed to a specific form of capitalism, even if some of its members oppose capitalism entirely. The anarchist activists involved in the movement are "usually anti-capitalist" <a href="http://www.monthlyreview.org/0901epstein.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.monthlyreview.org/0901epstein.htm" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> and often texts describing anarchist involvement in protests such as that against the WTO in Seattle don't even use the word "globalization"; they just describe them as being anti-capitalist. Unlike some protestors, they aren't involved in the movement simply due to an opposition to neoliberal globalization. They're involved because they're opposed to all forms of capitalism.

Evaluating it as a "minor and insignificant point of view" is obviously biased, since it is the main living modern form of anarchism. Let's see some citation for your claim. Re the Rothbard picture, let's compare with other guys with pictures.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Edmund Burke</span></h2>
<p>In the "origin" section the following is stated, "One of the earliest known essays explicitly advocating the absence of government was "A Vindication of Natural Society" (1756) by Edmund Burke.[3]"</p>
<p>Given that Edmund Burke stated explicitly that this essay was a satire, and that none of his political positions ever hinted otherwise (he was a staunch conservative), isn't it a little strange that this is listed in the origins section at all, much less as "advocating" anarchism? This would be like listing "A Modest Proposal" as part of the history of cannibalism advocacy on the cannibalism page without mentioning that it was a satire. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlahblahblahblahblahblah_a472.html" title="User:Blahblahblahblahblahblah">Blahblahblahblahblahblah</a> 09:21, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>True. It doesn't make sense to say he was advocating anarchism when it's generally regarded as a satirical piece. Although the Godwin quote noted is enough for me to think it probably deserves a place here in some fashion. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 10:12, 27 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It doesn't say that Burke advocated anarchism; it says that the essay did. It is not clear whether it was written satirically - the first edition said no such thing. The preface on the second edition (when Burke was going for a government position) claimed it was written in satire. At any rate, whether it was originally written as satire is irrelevant since many (including Godwin) took it at face value. <a href="../../../6/6/2E/User%7E66.90.101.225.html" title="User:66.90.101.225">66.90.101.225</a>
<dl>
<dd>If it is not clear whether or not it is a satire then it certainly doesn't belong in the origins section. Maybe it belongs somewhere else in the article, and if it is present it absolutely requires mention that the vast majority of scholars believe it was a satire. It is indeed a strange argument that Burke would only claim it was a satire to acquire a government position when he then maintained it was a satire for the remainder of his life and what is more fiercely advocated a conservative ideology. Was all of this just for show? If some editors want to claim that Burke was lying then could always do that elsewhere, but this kind of speculation does not make Burke appropriate for the origin of anarchism section. BTW, the part that states that Godwin was strongly influenced by Vindication is uncited. It would be nice if you could provide the referance for that so that we don't have to throw it out or put a citation needed superscript there. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlahblahblahblahblahblah_a472.html" title="User:Blahblahblahblahblahblah">Blahblahblahblahblahblah</a> 17:03, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I see the referance now, its the Godwin quote where he also clearly referances it as a satire, not as a work genuinely proposing the absence of government, "while the intention of the author was to shew that these evils were to be considered as trivial". <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlahblahblahblahblahblah_a472.html" title="User:Blahblahblahblahblahblah">Blahblahblahblahblahblah</a> 17:09, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>How do you figure that? If it was the first essay explicitly advocating the absence of government, then it belongs there regardless of whether it was written as satire. Many famous pieces have been reinterpreted over time contrary to the author's intent. E.g. "Vindiciae Contra Tyrannos" and John Locke's "The Two Treatises of Government." There is an excellent paper that discusses this, a PDF: <a href="http://polisci.ucsd.edu/calendar/KM.Folger%20&amp;%20UCSD.pdf" class="external text" title="http://polisci.ucsd.edu/calendar/KM.Folger%20&amp;%20UCSD.pdf" rel="nofollow">Reflections on Political Literature: History, Theory, and the Printed Book</a>. <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.92.163.234.html" title="User:64.92.163.234">64.92.163.234</a>

<dd>An essay explicitly arguing <b>against</b> the absence of government is different than one arguing for it. Thus the question of whether or not it is a satire is of primary importance, and since you agree this question is not answered the essay does not belong as part of the history. You can personally reinterpret the text all you want, it won't change the fact that the vast majority of scholars still agree it was a satire, not based solely on the text, not based solely on Burke's referance to it as a satire, but based also on its coherence with ALL of the political views he expressed in every other text he ever wrote.</dd>

<p>No one doubts that the essay argues explicitly against the State. The satire debate is about whether Burke meant the opposite of his explicit criticism of government. (Obviously, you've never read the essay, or you'd know it argues explicitly and in no uncertain terms against the State. Please read <a href="http://www.ozarkia.net/bill/anarchism/library/VindicationBurke/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ozarkia.net/bill/anarchism/library/VindicationBurke/index.html" rel="nofollow">Vindication of Natural Society</a> and and get a clue.)</p>

Saying <i>Vindication</i> was "possibly satire" seems accurate. Saying that the author "intended it as satire" is misleading. No one knows how Burke intended it when he wrote it. He said absolutely nothing about it being satire before it was published, nor in the first edition. He <i>claimed</i> it was satire in the preface to the second edition, after it became known that he was the author, when he happened to be vying for a government position. Burke's claime that he intended it as satire should be taken with a large grain of salt, just like Bill Clinton's claim that he didn't inhale. I think we should either return to the "possibly satire" formulation, or add the word "belatedly" to hint at the complexity, i.e. "although the author <i>belatedly</i> stated it was intended as satire." - A.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Proudhon and "statist capitalism"</span></h2>
<p>Someone give a source saying that Proudhon supported any form of capitalism. Saying he only opposed "statist capitalism" suggests that he must have preferred capitalism in some other form, and this is just ridiculous. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 22:23, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You've changed your mind, huh? Above, in "Anarchism, Possession and Property" you write the following about specifying the type of capitalism: <i>"That sounds good to me. It's cleaner, easier to read, and gets us from semantics to the point." - Sarge Baldy 20:32, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</i> Proudhon, of course, was talking about centralized control of industry using the state, the definition of capitalism in his day.</dd>

<p>"Statist capitalism" is a neologism. I've removed it from the article, leaving only "capitalism." I also removed the bit about Proudhon's ideas being "complex," because that's blatant editorializing. --AaronS 13:26, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree about Proudhon and complexity. I don't agree that the adjective "statist" is a neologism, or that using a well-know adjective to modify "capitalism" constitutes a neologism. It's simply an adjective. If that adjective bugs you, would you be happier with "political capitalism" per BlackCrayon.com? (The term "state capitalism" is already taken.) I really think it should be made clear that what Proudhon called "capitalism" was not the meaning we give it today. Back then it did not refer to an economic system, but a certain monopolistic arrangement of industry. <a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.219.253.189.html" title="User:216.219.253.189">216.219.253.189</a></dd>

<dd>We're not talking about an adjective, we're talking about a <i>term</i>: <b>statist capitalism</b>. --AaronS 17:17, 28 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Are all <i>adjective-noun</i> combinations neologisms? If not, what is your criteria? Wikipedia's criteria is basically <i>no original research.</i> Since modifying the word "capitalism" is not remotely original research, I don't see the problem. - A
<dl>
<dd>No. My criteria is that "statist" in this case is clearly not being used as a mere adjective, because we are being presented with the <i>idea</i> of "statist capitalism," especially as being in opposition to "non-statist capitalism." Neologisms are to be avoided in encyclopaedias. Further, novel descriptions are to be avoided; calling capitalism "statist" or "non-statist" is novel. --AaronS 19:14, 28 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>To most readers, it is a mere adjective. It underlines the difference between the 19th century definition of capitalism and the modern one. Proudhon was not against the market, nor even against private ownership of the means of production so long as it was the possession variety. To obscure that is to mislead readers. Repeating the question: Would you be happier with "political capitalism" or "capitalism in the 19th century sense"? - A.
<dl>
<dd>I don't think we should get into the game of assuming that we know what "most readers" are thinking when they read soemthing. "Political capitalism" is probably worse as a neologism than "statist capitalism." Your latter suggestion is getting closer to something encyclopaedia-worthy, but does not quite achieve it. What you're basically trying to say is "If Proudhon were alive today, he would not oppose capitalism." Well, Proudhon is not alive today, and you have no justification for such a claim. --AaronS 20:17, 28 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Neither should we delude readers into thinking that Proudhon was against markets or private possession property. Using the term "statist capitalism" would let readers know that what he opposed is not what we call "capitalism" today. In modern terminology, Proudhon was neither capitalist nor socialist. 216.98.161.210
<dl>
<dd>There is no such thing as "statist capitalism." Capitalism is an economic system, and does not by itself have a position on the existence of the state. --AaronS 15:59, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't think socialism has ever necessarily implied opposition to markets or property. Socialism has always been a broad term, and always included strands of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Market_socialism.html" title="Market socialism">market socialism</a>. Actually I think you'd be hard pushed to find a single major socialist party today that is opposed to markets and private property.<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBengalski_c6f3.html" title="User:Bengalski">Bengalski</a> 17:09, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

Why don't we just make it clear that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Proudhon was for markets.</li>
<li>He considered himself, and was considered by others, to be a socialist.</li>
<li>He opposed capitalism as he understood the term.</li>
</ol>
<p>How 'bout that? It'd be especially fun if we can hunt up a passage where Proudhon says exactly what he means by capitalism. <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBacchiad_744e.html" title="User:Bacchiad">Bacchiad</a> 17:47, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Why would Proudhon oppose capitalism as he <i>mis</i>understood the term? It seems redundant to note that he is using the term in a way that he understands it. Capitalism comes in many forms; one can certainly be anti-capitalist while supporting markets. In the past, there has been POV-pushing on this issue, mainly because a couple of editors wanted to make it seem as if, were he alive today, Proudhon would support anarcho-capitalism. --AaronS 17:53, 29 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>"as he understood the term" is not contrasted to "as he misunderstood the term" but rather "the present understanding of the term". Today, most readers of the article will think of markets (among other things) when they think of capitalism, even if there are non-capitalist sustainable market systems. There's the rub. If you just say someone "opposed capitalism", then even if they were using the definition of the time, and that definition is still used by some today, readers will infer that he "opposed markets". It's a difficult problem, and I'm open to solutions. Maybe an info box? Maybe a deep link to the wikiquote definition of capitalism he was using? <a href="../../../m/r/v/User%7EMrVoluntarist_23fd.html" title="User:MrVoluntarist">MrVoluntarist</a> 18:05, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Infoboxes? Heaven help us! Let's not get into that again. Aaron's point is well taken; we don't want to mislead either by implying, say, that Proudhon was in favor of landlordism, usury, the wage-system, etc. The best way we can do this is by providing depth, especially in the form of relevant and succint quotations or citations of his work. <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBacchiad_744e.html" title="User:Bacchiad">Bacchiad</a> 18:54, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

Here are some aspects of (modern) capitalism which Proudhon supported: 1) markets 2) private ownership on a small scale; possession</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>Where shall we find a power capable of counter-balancing the... State? There is none other than property... The absolute right of the State is in conflict with the absolute right of the property owner. Property is the greatest revolutionary force which exists.</i>" (Theory of Property in Lubac p. 177) Also: "<i>...the more ground the principles of democracy have gained, the more I have seen the working classes interpret these principles favorably to individual ownership.</i>" (General Idea of Revolution in the 19th Century p. 210)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Here's a quote from <a href="http://www.spunk.org/texts/writers/proudhon/sp001863.html" class="external text" title="http://www.spunk.org/texts/writers/proudhon/sp001863.html" rel="nofollow">an essay by L. Gambone</a>: "Proudhon was an enemy of state capitalism and state socialism." Using "state" as an adjective is not new.</p>
<p>I don't think Proudhon used the word "capitalism" in any of his writings. Wasn't he a geezer when Marx coined the term? Here's probably as close as he got: Proudhon in <i>The General Idea of the Revolution</i> wrote, "The school of Say ... has for ten years past seemed to exist only to protect and applaud the execrable work of the monopolists of money and necessities..."</p>
<p>Hmm. "Monopoly capitalism" may be the way to go. Or list the aspects of capitalism that he didn't like, and not use the term at all in his section. <a href="../../../p/b/a/User%7EPbanger_72c7.html" title="User:Pbanger">Pbanger</a></p>

<dd>Here are some aspects of (modern) capitalism which Proudhon opposed:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>rent</li>
<li>interest</li>
<li>profit</li>
<li>the wage system</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>The kind of market operation Proudhon envisioned under mutualized anarchy is so distinct that I think it's legitimate to label it (like he did) as opposed to capitalism.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Marx didn't invent the term capitalism. Read <i>What is Property</i> you'll find "capitalism" and "capitalist" all over.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The quotes you selected are very nice. They complement this one, which is already in the article:</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>He contrasted this with what he called "possession," or limited ownership of resources and goods only while in more or less continuous use. About this latter type of property, Proudhon wrote "Property is Liberty," and argued that it was a bulwark against state power.</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dd>As for the Gambone essay: first of all, it's not that old, so terms used in it can still be considered neologisms. But for me, the problem isn't so much that "state capitalism" is a neologism - it's inaccurate. Proudhon simply didn't believe that capitalism (with rent, interest, profit and the wage system) was possible without a state. Recall that Gambone's motive, in much of his writing, is to make classical social anarchist theory amenable to a libertarian audience - it is not to give an encyclopedic representation of Proudhon in his own terms. <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBacchiad_744e.html" title="User:Bacchiad">Bacchiad</a> 13:19, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Bacchiad, I think you are mistaken on two points. Marx coined the word "capitalism." Google "Marx coined capitalism" and you'll get many references to that effect. Also, Proudhon never used the term "capitalism" in <i>What is Property.</i> I searched two versions of it available on the web, and the word "capitalism" is simply not there. "Capital" yes; "capitalist" yes; but "capitalism" no. Which isn't surprising since Marx coined the term later.</p>
<p>Which brings up the quote (that used to be) in the Proudhon section. <b>I challenge this quote.</b></p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"The economic idea of capitalism, the politics of government or of authority, and the theological idea of the Church are three identical ideas, linked in various ways. To attack one of them is equivalent to attacking all of them . . ."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The ref says "quoted by Max Nettlau, A Short History of Anarchism, pp. 43-44." But Nettlau was born the year Proudhon died, and the alleged quote appears nowhere in Proudhon's writings. One suspects it is Nettlau's paraphrase of what he believed Proudhon meant.</p>
<p>I like the idea of listing the specific grievances against what was to be called modern capitalism, i.e. rent, interest, profit, and the wage labor system. But perhaps all of this is moot, now that there is no Proudhon section anymore. I can't say I'm too keen on the idea of removing Proudhon from an article about anarchism. I think I liked the other way better (but without the fraudulent quote.) <a href="../../../p/b/a/User%7EPbanger_72c7.html" title="User:Pbanger">Pbanger</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Er, yeah. It means quoted from his writings. I'd be more likely to suspect it was in his writings somewhere than pulled out of thin air. Seeing as Nettlau was a historian, I'm sure he had pretty good access to documents from Proudhon that haven't been formally published, and probably wouldn't try passing off subjective paraphrases as legitimate quotes. Looking now, his article even says he had an extensive archive, likely including a number of Proudhon documents. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 16:43, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here's some more references to work in. These come from <i>Anarchism</i> by Sean M. Sheehan (2004), who does not appear to be an anarchist himself.</p>
<p>Another equally important boundary is reached when individualist anarchism becomes indistinguishable from extreme right-wing conservatism and its worship of the free market. The term 'anarcho-capitalism' for this domain of right wing libertarianism is generally regarded as a political oxymoron by anarchists, but it points to an ambiguity about libertarianism that won't go away. (pg. 39)</p>
<p>Anarchists oppose capitalism for much the same reasons as socialists do. The capitalist economic system is viewed as necessarily unfair, privileging power in the hands of a discrete class at the expense of ordinary working people. (pg. 46)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Proposition: "Origins of anarchism" article split</span></h2>
<p>This article is much too long. I propose that we move the "Origins" section into a new <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origins_of_anarchism.html" title="Origins of anarchism">origins of anarchism</a> article. We could then condense that section, describing the subsections in one or two sentences. What say you all?

<p>This would require a bit of thought, as the different strains of anarchism are introduced in a chronological manner. We could keep that chronology, but take their description outside of the context of explaining the history of anarchism. Make sense? --AaronS 14:04, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The reference is crap. What it says, however, could stand without the reference.

Although Godwin did not use the word "<i>anarchism</i>," many later anarchists have regarded this book as the first major anarchist text, and Godwin as the "founder of philosophical anarchism." But at this point no anarchist movement yet existed, and the term "<i>anarchiste</i>" was known mainly as an insult hurled by the <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bourgeois.html" title="Bourgeois">bourgeois</a> <a href="../../../g/i/r/Girondins.html" title="Girondins">Girondins</a> at more radical elements in the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Revolution_970a.html" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a>. --<a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeeboe_2072.html" title="User:Beeboe">Beeboe</a></dd>

<dd>I have nothing wrong with having Godwin in the article. There are several reasons why I removed your addition, however. The first is that you claimed that "earliest known essay explicitly advocating the absence of government was 'A Vindication of Natural Society' (1756) by Edmund Burke." But, the source that you cited only provides a reference to Godwin describing Burke's essay. Burke himself admitted that the essay was satirical. The second is that your claim that "many later anarchists have regarded [Godwin's essay] as the first major anarchist text" is completely unsourced. The third is your claim that Godwin is the "founder of philosophical anarchism," which is also unsourced. --AaronS 19:35, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You mean the Wendy McElroy reference? Yeah, that's POV; and even for being POV, it's needlessly snarky about the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labor_theory_of_value.html" title="Labor theory of value">labor theory of value</a>. Not to mention the usual Rothbardolatry. But that aside, it gives an accurate picture of the difference. It's practically unneccessary as a reference, but I've refrained from stripping it out as a choose your battles sort of thing.</p>
<p>Anyway, the present <b>Capitalism</b> subsection may as well be called <b>Anarcho-Capitalism</b> since that's the only thing it discusses. And that doesn't make sense in <b>Issues</b> since ancap isn't an issue, it's an ideology. The way I see it, we've got three options for placement:</p>
<ol>
<li>An. and the Individual -&gt; Stirner, Individualism, Ancap</li>
<li>Issues -&gt; Capitalism -&gt; Ancap, Anti-Globalization</li>
<li>Issues -&gt; Capitalism and Leftism -&gt;Ancap, Post-Left</li>
</ol>
<p>My preference would be for the second or third; but VisionThing is going to edit-war either way. Since the present setup is so cruddy, we've got to decide whether we should put it under <b>Individual</b> and maintain the necessary disclaimers, or else go for one of the other two (or some fourth option) and present a strong, united front if VisionThing reverts. <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBacchiad_744e.html" title="User:Bacchiad">Bacchiad</a> 20:03, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Putting anarcho-capitalism under Individualist Anarchism is most logical. However, putting it under capitalism makes for a more coherant section. Why? When the ancap section stands alone, anti-capitalist POV warriors tend to garbage it up with disclaimers every sentence or two. The advantage of being in the Capitalist section is that all the little anti-cap rants can be shunted to the Cap intro section. <a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeeboe_2072.html" title="User:Beeboe">Beeboe</a></p>

<p>I think this might be the best consensus option. I have two concerns. The first is, I want to limit the number of disclaimers, weasel words, yes-it-is-no-it-isn't back and forths in the article generally. This includes the ancap section, which is why in a previous edit I cut the criticism section down to:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Most anarcho-capitalists believe that in the absence of state coercion, free capitalism would naturally and inevitably develop. Hence, Rothbard's statement that "capitalism is the fullest expression of anarchism, and anarchism is the fullest expression of capitalism." This has met resistance from anarchists who hold that capitalism is inherently oppressive and hierarchical.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I want to do the anti-globo people the same courtesy. Also, I don't want to paint an (I think false) picture of ancaps as corporate apologists; a lot of the most prominent ancap people, like the Mises Institute, are equally anti-WTO, -G8, etc. They may disagree on tactics and prefer to phrase it as opposition to "world government" rather than "globalization", but I don't want to obscure that position. But I think we could settle on a short sentence with a good reference that captures the thing properly. Let me think on it and, if no one else does first, I'll post a draft version to the talk page. <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBacchiad_744e.html" title="User:Bacchiad">Bacchiad</a> 14:03, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>To capture the thing properly, we need to note the semantic quibble. To anarcho-socialists "globalization" = "neocolonialism." To anarcho-capitalists "globalization" = "expansion of the division of labor." In short, both are against neocolonialism, but only the ansocs (some, anyway) are against the division of labor. Per your reduction of disclaimers suggestion, I moved the latest disclaimer to the Capitalism intro section. <a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeeboe_2072.html" title="User:Beeboe">Beeboe</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Beeboe, you seem to have an over-riding interest in semantic quibbles. Let's say for a moment that <i>if</i> the semantic distinction were important to a lot of notable ancaps <i>and if</i> they used the same definitions as you do, it would be important to include in the article. Let's just assume that as a thought experiment. Now, could you provide a couple of good citations where notable ancaps do that? Then we could hash out whether it merits mention. <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBacchiad_744e.html" title="User:Bacchiad">Bacchiad</a> 01:12, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sock-puppetry aside, I don't agree with the term 'antiquated' or accept the needs for a million disclaimers. First of all, it doesn't say "they were socialists"; it says they described their position as "socialism". Which they did. And furthermore, there's already a good deal of wording about ind. anarchist defense of private <i>possession</i> and markets, and opposition to state socialism. It's abundantly clear from the article in its present state that what they meant by socialism is different from the average everyday definition. Finally, 'antiquated' and 'obsolete' are POV; they imply worthlessness. 'Different from today's common understanding of the word' would be more acceptable, though I think still unneccessary. <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBacchiad_744e.html" title="User:Bacchiad">User:Bacchiad</a> 01:06, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Although FNB as a group says it's nonviolent, in my own experience, many if not most of the people involved don't have any problem with black blocs and property destruction.

Please, we're not idiots.</b> I think it's quite obvious that these IP's and users are hogeye evading, based on their editing style and the content of the edits they are making. And looking at Hogeye's <i>extensive</i> history of evading, it makes sense to assume any new user who starts making pro-capitalist edits is probably Hogeye, especially when the edits are exactly the same as other Hogeye socks (many of which have been blocked already). Also, you're question was a direct response to my above comment.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Milton and David</span></h2>
<p>Why does somebody keep deleting references to the fact that anarcho-capitalist David Friedman is the son of Republican-monetarist Milton Friedman? It certainly seems relevant. It illustrates one of the directions (I don't say the only direction!) whence anarcho-capitalist thoughts can arise. Whether you think of David as rebelling against Dad, or staying essentially within Dad's fold, or as something between the two is up to you. But the fact of their relationship is NPOV, and should be in here. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristofurio_ba82.html" title="User:Christofurio">Christofurio</a> 15:14, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Same reason we cut out/cut down the paragraph on Latin American syndicalism, the bio of Warren and Tucker, the blockquote in anti-fascism, and other stuff: economy. This is a big long article that has to cover a lot of territory. In broad terms I think it's interesting that David is Milton son, but that's most interesting in his own article, kind of interesting in the ancap article, and in my personal judgement least interesting in the anarchism article. Personal judgment call, but I thought the most relevant things were utilitarianism and medieval Iceland. <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBacchiad_744e.html" title="User:Bacchiad">Bacchiad</a> 03:05, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The two-way division (between 'anarchism and workers' liberation' and 'anarchism and the individual') suggests that these causes parted ways; of course they did not and some individualist anarchists e.g. Labadie, were unvolved in syndicalist unions, etc. I'm edit-shy but mebbe moving 'anarchism and the individual' above 'anarchism and workers' liberation,' and moving the cross-references, might help.

<dd>I don't think it especially matters what size an article is compared to another. Wikipedia is fraught with systemic bias. Jimbo Wales himself is Objectivist, and a large proportion of editors are middle/upper class tech-savvy males from the United States with a lot of spare time. With those demographics, NPOV becomes a completely impossible joke, even if it remains useful as a rule of thumb. What I can say is that this article is fraught with issues, particularly regarding the anarcho-capitalist section. At present, there's no real disclaimers about it, and it has a massive section. It would be difficult to name 10 notable anarcho-capitalists, where there's no difficulty in naming hundreds of anti-capitalist anarchists. <a href="http://recollectionbooks.com/bleed/gallery/galleryindex.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://recollectionbooks.com/bleed/gallery/galleryindex.htm" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> And this despite anarchism being a grassroots movement with mostly unrecognized members, and anarcho-capitalism being a stand-alone American ideology without a significant movement of any kind (let alone being part of the anarchist movement more generally). Certainly this section is highly overweighted. Likewise, it needs a significant disclaimer because "'anarcho-capitalism'... is generally regarded as a political oxymoron by anarchists" (<i>Anarchism</i>, Sean M. Sheehan, 2004, pg. 39). <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 20:43, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Authority as "Evil" vs. "Harmful"</span></h2>
<p>I'd like to propose a small change which, under normal circumstances I might just be inclined to edit without a discussion. However, because this page is constantly vandalised and hotly contested, I thought it best to discuss the matter first. It is the matter of whether anarchists should be defined as deeming goverment/authority as "evil," as the current summary does: "Thus 'anarchism,' in its most general semantic meaning, is the belief that all forms of rulership are evil and should be abolished."</p>
<p>I dislike the use of this term because is suggests a moral bias based in a dicotomy of good vs evil, such as a christian morality of rightiousness vs a moral evil. On the surface it may not seem to be a problem, but many anarchists do not see this matter in such terms. To that end, I would suggest a definition which does not depend on moral subjectivity. Perhaps using the term "harmful" or "negative" instead would be best? I propose two possible alternatives, the second of which is something of a quote from Lawrence Jarach's anarchist phamplet, "Instead of Another Meeting."</p>
<p>"Thus 'anarchism,' in its most general semantic meaning, is the belief that all forms of rulership are [1) harmful to society] [2) a negative means of maintaining social harmony] and should be abolished.

<dd>Well, it's already been changed, but no, it should not say evil for the same reason you gave. A lot of anarchists do not believe in evil as a concept and reject dichotomies like "good" and "evil".

<p>I am the one that substituted 'evil' for 'undesirable'. Can you back up your statement above, "A lot of anarchists do not believe in evil as a concept, etc.". About the revert of my recent edits, unless you can show how they are incorrect, then they will go back to the way they were. I'm not particular about the word 'evil', itself, but undesirable is just softening what any self-respecting anarchist would agree on..the putridness of governments. Another thing is the push for communism in this article. Are we talking about anarchism or communism? I'm reverting it back again. This article is not cutting it in my perspective, and I am 100% anarchist anti-authoritarianism.

<dd>First off, I didn't revert it the first time, someone else did, so I'm not sure why this is directed towards me. Second, read <a href="../../../d/a/y/Days_of_War%2C_Nights_of_Love_53a7.html" title="Days of War, Nights of Love">Days of War, Nights of Love</a>, especially <a href="http://www.crimethinc.com/library/english/nogods.html" class="external text" title="http://www.crimethinc.com/library/english/nogods.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> essay on Crimethinc.com. Crimethinc is one of the most influential anarchist groups in america right now in terms of ideology (or lack thereof), so the fact that they are saying this suggests that many anarchists probably feel similarly. And although I don't feel like searching for any of it right now, there have been debates on <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infoshop.org.html" title="Infoshop.org">infoshop.org</a> about the idea of morality, and many people involved have rejected it. As for the rest of your edits, why are you so intent on changing it? This is the version of the intro we have agreed upon. I don't see the benefit of your changes. I especially hope that you will not just change it back again without a consensus on this page first. Lastly, why you are bringing in this "are we talking about anarchism or communism" here thing, like the two are mutually exclusive--many anarchists are communists as well, and most if not all (depending on your definition of anarchism) are socialists or socialist-inspired. If you have a particular problem with it somewhere in the article, could you say what it is? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force">The Ungovernable Force</a> 04:06, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>User:AaronS is trying to revert my perfectly cited addition to anarchism. "Some" in this case does not mean "as opposed to many." It just means here that there are people out there holding to the first view, and that there are people out there holding the second view. "Many" in itself is a weasel word best to be avoided.

That while some anarchists reject the state, other anarchists reject the state? That's redundant. If that's not what you mean, then it needs to be reworded.

One could also include the existence of anarcho-communist collectives whose members numbered in the tens of thousands, and its large influence on several prominent labor unions worldwide. Of course, many other movements have played large rolls as well, though it would be hard to match anarcho-communism for sheer numbers or visibility, but that is why detailed accounts of all anarchist ideologies are included in this article.

<dd>None of your statements thus far have been sourced, whereas the article lists numerous sources for its claims. To be frank you don't sound like someone entirely versed in the history of anarchism, perhaps you should take some time to read some Tucker, Proudhon, Kropotkin, and Bakunin, before making blanket claims about the history of anarchism. Nonetheless, if you feel any prominent anarchist is being left out of the article you can always inform us about them here or add them yourself.</dd>

<p>In addition to the claims in the article, which are already sourced, you might want to try reading some other encyclopedia to get a quick overview of the philosophy. For example, here are some relevant quotes from encarta, which you can find <a href="http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568770/Anarchism.html" class="external text" title="http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568770/Anarchism.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>"Anarchism arose out of the ideological ferment of the French Revolution and in reaction to both the European bureaucratic nation state and the advent of large-scale industrial capitalism."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"However, anarchism, as a self-conscious ideology, appeared in Europe during the first half of the 19th century, the uneasy sibling of modern socialism and communism."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Foreshadowing syndicalism, which would become an important factor in the French labour movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Proudhonian mutualism argued that workers’ associations would replace the capitalist economy, enabling the political State to wither away."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Like Rousseau, most schools of anarchists believed in positive rather than negative freedom. For both, freedom was based on political, economic, and social equality, but whereas Rousseau relied on State coercion and the education of the next generation in the ways of classical republican virtue, the anarchists believed that a stateless society would be accomplished through non-coercive persuasive example and libertarian education."</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't believe any of these statements are appropriate sources for this article, which should rely on the primary sources readily available, but it might help to familiarize you with the subject. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlahblahblahblahblahblah_a472.html" title="User:Blahblahblahblahblahblah">Blahblahblahblahblahblah</a> 09:03, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You aren't going to get them, VisionThing, because those aren't factual statements, they're rhetorical tropes - and somewhat POV ones at that. The first is a banality (the Russian Revolution was a seismic event in world history, so of course it was a seismic event for anarchism, just as it was for capitalism, communism, royalism, and everything else); the second is hyperbole. Instead of sowing fact tags everywhere, why don't you actually try to <i>edit</i> the article.

<dd>Hi Shannon, reading your comments here and at anarcho-capitalism I get the feeling of a clash of cultures and paradigms between you and the socialist anarchist editors. In all honesty, while I disagree with it, I respect your viewpoint that what you understand by anarchy is incompatible with communism, or ´socialism´. But while you have every right to argue that position, you should recognise that it is not a view that has been shared by most anarchists, either historically or today.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I´d go further and say that this position is one that is limited to a specific, and narrow, historical and geographical environment. The only people I have ever encountered araguing for anarcho-capitalism, or taking it at all seriously, are from the United States. And yes this is the English language wikipedia, and written predominantly by North Americans, but our goal I think is to be a global not a US encyclopedia. We need to be thinking of what anarchists across the world, throughout the history of the movement, have meant by the term. And, whether you agree with them or not, most anarchists throughout history have considered their beliefs to be a form of socialism, and in practice have been closely allied with other stripes of socialists in revolutionary and labour struggles.</dd>

<dd>The fact is that anarcho-capitalism is a new idea, and quite distinct from other, better known and more widespread, ideas of anarchism. Here is how an-cap Wendy McElroy sees it <a href="http://zetetics.com/mac/agora2.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://zetetics.com/mac/agora2.htm" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>:</dd>

<dd>´´The result [of Rothbard´s work in the 1950s] was something entirely new under the sun: an anarchist movement that championed capitalism. It is difficult to even come up with a parallel to give you a sense of how incredible a hybrid capitalism and anarchism make. If you can imagine someone proving that not only are Freudianism and Behaviorism both correct but that both are nd always have been compatible, you might get the flavor of it all. For better or worse, this moral and sophisticated defense of capitalism has greatly distanced individualist anarchism from the general anarchist movement which still considers capitalism to be an evil on the level of, if identical with, the State. And when you talk to communist anarchists, if they don't get immediately hostile, they are likely to express total bewilderment at this bizarre combination of beliefs.´´</dd>

<dl>
<dd>McElroy, who knows the history of ´libertarianism´, is quite open about how far it departs from ´general´ anti-capitalist anarchism. But it seems some newer, younger, ancaps and right-libertarians have grown up with the Rothbard doctine as an established fact, so are maybe not even aware of anarchism´s development as a socialist movement.</dd>

<dd>I think some of the confusion that arises here is because anarcho-capitalists, and the libertarian right in general, have developed a particular and narrow definition of socialism as something like full state ownership or control of property. In this, funnily enough, they come close to agreeing with the Marxists, acting as if only Marxist socalism is the real thing and other forms rest are aberrant or anomalous, if they even acknowledge their existence. But, even aside from anarchists, there are many forms and branches of socialism, and have been from the start. The utopianisms of Robert Owen, Charles Fourier, etc. preceded Marx, as did the mutualism of Proudhon. While Marxist variants of socialism became prominent in continental Europe, to the UK for example there were the many stripes of reformist socialisms, fabianism, municipal socialism etc. And many other variants - guild socialism, christian socialism, eurocommunism, etc etc. Few of these fit the easy simplifications of Mises, Rothbard et al.</dd>

<dd>As for communism, certainly not all anarchists have been communists. But many of the biggest, most effective anarchist miovements were. If you want to get a flavour of what communist anarschism meant at its strongest, you might look at Isaac Puente´s ´Comunismo Libertario´<a href="http://flag.blackened.net/liberty/libcom.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://flag.blackened.net/liberty/libcom.html" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> - this was the economic manifestor adopted by the world´s biggest anarchist movement, the Spanish CNT which in 1936 had 1.5 million members. This at a time when, as McElroy writes, "individualist anarchism virtually died in 1908 when the offices of Tucker's Liberty and bookstore burnt to the ground."Bengalski.</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Why must all editors who disagree with anarcho-capitalist POV be socialists?</span></h3>
<p>Or anarchists at all? I don't really buy this whole "clash of the POVs" characterization. Sure, there are some people, here, who have clearly drawn the line in the sand. That's beneficial, because it's honest, but it's also detrimental, because it allows people to portray every one of your edits as being POV. A long time ago, I refused to endorse my own beliefs as socialist or socialist anarchist. I still do. My interest in this subject is academic. I'm too young, uninformed, uneducated, and downright stupid to know what politics would be best for the world. I find the anarchist ideal to be, well, <i>ideal</i> and <i>romantic</i>, but I do not let that enter into my editing process, just as I wouldn't let my love of, say, <a href="../../../j/2E/r/J.R.R._Tolkien_b884.html" title="J.R.R. Tolkien">J.R.R. Tolkien</a>'s work allow me to add "<i>The Lord of the Rings</i> is the best piece of fantasy fiction" to the <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_of_the_Rings_293e.html" title="Lord of the Rings">Lord of the Rings</a> article.</p>
<p>I wager that there are other editors, here, who tend to find themselves at the receiving end of some of the anarcho-capitalist editors' accusations, and who feel the same as I. I resent the characterization of the frequent disputes regarding this article as being between a cadre of socialists and a cadre of right libertarians. Sometimes, some of us, who just love knowledge, history, politics, or whatever, get caught in the middle. The fact of the matter is that the users who many accused of POV-pushing -- <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> and <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> -- were eventually banned for or admitted to doing just that. RJII even drafted quite an amusing manifesto as to the success of his "psychological warfare," sounding not so different from a deranged <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caligula.html" title="Caligula">Caligula</a> returning from a victorious campaign against the ocean itself, adding to his treasury a sizeable bounty of seashells and sand, and declaring himself <a href="../../../j/u/p/Jupiter.html" title="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>.</p>
<p>This is about what is verifiable and encyclopaedic. So, let's stick to that. We know RJII has sock puppets, but it doesn't really matter. Let him play with himself. In the meantime, stick to the article and its content, and stop sticking it to one another. --AaronS 15:32, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agreed. I personally do label myself as a socialist, and I think there are some good aspects to certain types of communism, but I'm more of a <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-left_anarchy.html" title="Post-left anarchy">post-leftist</a>. I tend to dislike narrow ideologies and I try to be open-minded, especially in the real world. The problem is that there are many people, like RJII and Hogeye who come here immediatly on the offensive, pushing POV's that don't mesh well with history. To defend against this, some of us react aggresively and it may come accross as a strong communistic pov. I think RJII loved to characterize everyone who disagreed with him a commie, and some of the newer supporters of an-cap around wikipedia seem to have the same problem. I however am not really a communist, and I don't think most of the other editors here are either. <font color="black"><b>The</b></font> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="green"><b>Ungovernable</b></font></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_6a81.html" title="User talk:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="black"><b>Force</b></font></a> 21:11, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Post-leftism is quite interesting. I think I said once that, if I were to embrace an anarchist ideology, it would be post-lef anarchy. That's probably true. Or maybe post-anarchism.

<dd>I'm an anarchist-without-adjectives myself. My biggest problem with the couple banned editors is their misrepresentation of various forms of anarchism as necessarily anti-thetical, blowing the dichotomy between individualists and communists out of proportion and falsely asserting that there can be no reconciliation. I think they do this to generate the impression that anarcho-capitalism is not a disputed ideology in anarchism, because all forms of anarchism dispute each other. But anyone who has spent time with individualist and communist anarchists know that their disagreements are a sidebar at most. If anarcho-capitalists could just have the intellectual integrity of balancing their edits, rather than waging constant "war", I would welcome their input on the under-represented branches of anarchism. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlahblahblahblahblahblah_a472.html" title="User:Blahblahblahblahblahblah">Blahblahblahblahblahblah</a> 05:20, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also important to note are the types of evidence being offered here. Tucker repeated on many occasions in his published work that he was a socialist, whereas this "quote" of him finding capitalism tolerable is from late in life (when he also said that individualist anarchism could no longer defeat capitalism on its own due to the extent of wealth concentration), and is from a third party referancing a 2nd hand source who supposedly overheard Tucker say it once.

<dd>Note that he is talking about confiscation of wealth that businesses acquired by employing state intervention to prevent competition. He is not talking about confiscating wealth acquired in a free market. I don't doubt that many anarcho-capitalists would also not oppose such a confiscation because it would be stolen wealth. In fact, Rothbard argues as much: "What of the myriad of corporations which are integral parts of the military-industrial complex, which not only get over half or sometimes virtually all their revenue from the government but also participate in mass murder? What are their credentials to "private" property? Surely less than zero. As eager lobbyists for these contracts and subsidies, as co-founders of the garrison state, they deserve confiscation and reversion of their property to the genuine private sector as rapidly as possible. To say that their "private" property must be respected is to say that the property stolen by th e horsethief and t h e murdered must be "respected". But how then do we go about destatizing the entire mass of government property, as well as the "private property" of General Dynamics? All this needs detailed thought and inquiry on the part of libertarians. One method would be to turn over ownership to the homesteading workers in the particular plants..." <a href="http://mises.org/journals/lf/1969/1969_06_15.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://mises.org/journals/lf/1969/1969_06_15.pdf" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> Does this make Rothbard a "socialist"?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">stop removing Godwin</span></h2>
<p>Please put the para on Godwin back in, Aaron. Kropotkin is far from the only major writer to peg Godwin as a key player in anarchist theory. And Kropotkin's EB article is far from an 'unreliable source' by the way. Though if you need others look at Rocker, Woodcock, or I imagine almost any introduction to anarchism or even any serious anarchist website. Or indeed the current EB article.<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBengalski_c6f3.html" title="User:Bengalski">Bengalski</a> 14:47, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No problem. I was unaware of that. For this article, however, I would probably consider Kropotkin's EB article a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_source.html" title="Primary source">primary source</a>. As such, we should note that Kropotkin is the one saying it, or back it up with other, more reliable sources. I didn't know that there were other sources available. So, I have no problem with the statement being in the article. --AaronS 15:20, 19 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>From that WP article: "In historical scholarship, a primary source is a document or other source of information that was created at or near the time being studied, often by the people being studied. In this sense primary does not mean superior. It refers to creation by the primary players, and is distinguished from a secondary source, which is a historical work, like a scholarly book or article, built up from primary sources." So I'd say Kropotkin on Godwin was a secondary source - they were not contemporaries. The fact is that most historical works on anarchism have been written by anarchism - that doesn't necessarily invalidate their scholarship. But yes we should attribute the quote to Kropotkin.<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBengalski_c6f3.html" title="User:Bengalski">Bengalski</a> 15:29, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Tucker was not against private property. To quote Madison: He [Benjamin Tucker] made clear, however, that in a free society private property was legitimate and everyone had the right to own what he could gain by his own enterprise and efficiency...Anarchists, he stated, believed in "competition everywhere and always."</dd>
<dd>Madison included nice quotes of Tucker as well: "Anarchism does not recognize the principle of human rights, but it recognizes human equality as a necessity of stable society." and about protection, it "is a thing to be secured, so long as it is necessary, by voluntary association and cooperation for self-defence, or as a commodity to be purchased, like any other commodity, of those who offer the best article at the lowest price."</dd>
<dd>Intangible 19:22, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>And to include one primary source:</dd>
<dd>"Anarchism is a word without meaning, unless it includes the liberty of the individual to control his product or whatever his product has brought him through exchange in a free market - that is, private property.

<dd>If you think Tucker is against private property you could not be more wrong. Private property is the right to control what you produce instead of the community having control over it including a right to sell it on the market. Individualist anarchism is centered around support for private property.

<p>How is this not anarcho-capitalism? Tucker did never expand on economic theory himself, so he might as well have been an anarcho-capitalist. The only difference I can see between the individualist anarchism and anarcho-capitalism as a whole is a difference of opinion with regard to economic theory (<a href="../../../l/a/b/Labor_theory_of_value.html" title="Labor theory of value">Labor theory of value</a> versus <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marginalism.html" title="Marginalism">Marginalism</a>).</p>

<dd>I agree that that is the most substantial difference, that is, their economics. Tucker thinks that free banking would result in zero interest rate and no profit. But that is just flawed economics. There would still be high rates of interest depending on what part of the business cycle we were in. I just read an article from Rothbard on that in the Individualist Anarchism article. The main difference is what they think the result of implementation of a free market would be. Also the idea that profit is theft just does not make sense because it assumes that a thing is worth how much labor was put into it. But that is philosophically unsound because worth is a value judgement made by every individual. Just because it took one person one hour to create a widget and another person two hours it does not mean it is worth more and that he should be paid more for it. Why the old school individualist anarchists did not see the obvious errors in their economics is mind boggling. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheIndividualist_25e6.html" title="User:TheIndividualist">TheIndividualist</a> 18:52, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As no one picked it up before I'll post this interesting quote and link from an-cap Wendy McElroy on the history of anarcho-capitalism again. While she herself believes that ancapism is a descendent of earlier anti-capitalist US individualism, she recognises that it is a new and 'bizarre' departure. Refreshing to read an anarcho-capitalist writer who has enough confidence in her philosophy to be honest about its history, and the fact that it is a minority viewpoint disputed by 'the general anarchist movement'.</dd>

<dd><i>The result [of Rothbard´s work in the 1950s] was something entirely new under the sun: an anarchist movement that championed capitalism. It is difficult to even come up with a parallel to give you a sense of how incredible a hybrid capitalism and anarchism make. If you can imagine someone proving that not only are Freudianism and Behaviorism both correct but that both are nd always have been compatible, you might get the flavor of it all. For better or worse, this moral and sophisticated defense of capitalism has greatly distanced individualist anarchism from the general anarchist movement which still considers capitalism to be an evil on the level of, if identical with, the State. And when you talk to communist anarchists, if they don't get immediately hostile, they are likely to express total bewilderment at this bizarre combination of beliefs.</i><a href="http://zetetics.com/mac/agora2.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://zetetics.com/mac/agora2.htm" rel="nofollow">[21]</a><a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBengalski_c6f3.html" title="User:Bengalski">Bengalski</a> 22:09, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

So I'm not sure why you want to equate a lack of authoritarian power with a lack of <i>organization</i>. Besides which, the version prior to your edit referred to anarchism as "a manner of organizing society," which doesn't imply anything about either a large or small amount of organization. The point is that anarchism refers to both a philosophy and a society which is in accordance with that philosophy. Lots of political terms have this ambiguity ("communism," for instance). Perhaps instead of saying "a manner of organizing society" we could say "a form of society," or "a type of society." Saying that "anarchism is a loosely organized society" doesn't accurarely characterize those anarchists who are in favor of organization, for example <a href="../../../p/l/a/Platformism.html" title="Platformism">platformists</a>. <a href="../../../v/o/l/User%7EVoluntarySlave_e88b.html" title="User:VoluntarySlave">VoluntarySlave</a> 01:42, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Although I personally like the idea of small-scale organizing and have some problems with strong levels of federation, that is a common anarchist position, especially within classic anarchism. I think with post-leftism and primitivism there are a lot more anarchists who are opposed to highly organized societies, but many anarchists past and present have advocated complex socities organized in a non-authoritarian fashion.

<dd>I would agree as well. Obviously you'd need some form of organization, or you really would have chaos, but it would have to be light.

Since anarcho-communists, syndicalists, post-left anarchists, anarchists-without-adjectives, individualists, primitivists, etc, all share a dislike of all forms of capitalism, but only some share a dislike of all forms of communism, it is probably not appropriate to ascribe a general dislike of communism to most anarchists in the intro. If it was qualified to "state communism" I don't think there would be any problem, as that is universal amongst anarchists. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlahblahblahblahblahblah_a472.html" title="User:Blahblahblahblahblahblah">Blahblahblahblahblahblah</a> 02:36, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Someone was putting in state socialism as well. I didn't do anything about it at the time since it is true and not that important, but as someone else said, it's pretty redundant.

<dd>I have been observing this debate for some time now and it seems that the participating anarchist capitalists are a minority group seeking to influence this page to slant it towards their own interests. I am an anarchist-w/o-adjectives so i think there is room for everyone here but the fact is most historical and contemporary anarchists deem capitalism expliotitive and inherently authoritarian. To argue otherwise is to ignore both history and the makeup of modern anarchist groups. I have personally never heard of an actual, non-internet based anarchist capitalist group while i can name a dozen anti-capitalist groups with large local memberships in this country (US) alone. In my opinion, the intro to a wiki page entitled "anarchism" should give the most accurate impression of the most common anarchist beliefs, and stating that most anarchists identify capitalism as authoritarian is correct while stating that many anarchists identify collectivism as authoritarian is not accurate. Certianly state sponsored collectivism is not acceptable to any anarchists but using "state" twice in a single sentence is redundant. Anarchist Capitalists are not excluded form this article, they have their own section detailing exactly what they believe. They should not try and coopt the entire article to represent their beliefs as they are not the beliefs of the majority of anarchists either worldwide or in the US. I would not try and influence the article to slant it towards anachism-w/o-adjectives, that category has its own section detialing its tenants just like the one on ancap. I see a divisive and hostile spirit in the ancaps here and i don't think they are representing those who believe likewise in a very flattering light. Just my observations, take them for what you will. Piece, <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlockader_5d3e.html" title="User:Blockader"><font color="red"><b>Blockader</b></font></a></dd>

<dd>"it seems that the participating anarchist capitalists are a minority group seeking to influence this page" - yes, minority groups are allowed to "influence pages" in wikipedia. Its a process of consensus seeking, which is different from a majority-driven process precisely because a minority has a good deal more influence wherever some consensus broader than 50.1% is required. Anarcho-capitalists, of whom I am an example, have tried to "influence this page" (what bastards we must be, to try to exert some 'influence,' horrors!) because we are concerned that in the absense of our influence, the page will have an anti-capitalist POV. You have a similar, although a mirror-image, concern it appears. So we don't have to regard each other as sinister cabals. We're all just folk, trying to work out our differences and produce a good encyclopedia article not just in spite of those differences but through them. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristofurio_ba82.html" title="User:Christofurio">Christofurio</a> 01:34, 23 July 2006 (UTC) And you meant to wish us "peace," I hope ... not to wish us into pieces.

IMHO RJ was a fine editor who rightly insisted that statements of fact be properly authenticated and who was railroaded out of here by people who found that railroading easier than complying with his insistence. But ... hey, that's just me. (You can hardly accuse me of being his sock puppet, by the way. Check my user page and contributions list and you'll learn better soon enough.)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Proudhon</span></h2>
<p><b>This entire section, in a nutshell, shows how this article is more an article about socialism than anarchism.</b></p>
<p><i>Pierre-Joseph Proudhon is regarded as the first self-proclaimed anarchist, a label which he adopted in his 1840 work What is Property?. It is for this reason that some claim Proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory.[4] He developed the theory of spontaneous order in society, where organization emerges without any central authority, a "positive anarchy" in which order arises from every individual "doing what he wishes and only what he wishes."[5] He saw anarchy as:</i></p>
<p><i>"a form of government or constitution in which public and private consciousness, formed through the development of science and law, is alone sufficient to maintain order and guarantee all liberties. In it, as a consequence, the institutions of the police, preventive and repressive methods, officialdom, taxation, etc., are reduced to a minimum. In it, more especially, the forms of monarchy and intensive centralization disappear, to be replaced by federal institutions and a pattern of life based on the commune."[6]</i></p>
<p><i>His opposition to capitalism, the state, and organised religion inspired subsequent anarchists, and made him one of the leading socialist thinkers of his time[7]</i></p>
<ol>
<li>"a form of government or constitution in which public and private consciousness, formed through the development of science and law, is alone sufficient to maintain order and guarantee all liberties. In it, as a consequence, the institutions of the police, preventive and repressive methods, officialdom, taxation, etc., are reduced to a minimum." Sorry, Paine and Jefferson came up with that first.</li>
<li>"every individual "doing what he wishes and only what he wishes" Is a concept that goes back to Lao Tsu and Paine, Jefferson and the other loyal Jeffersonians (not Madison who was a federalist spy.) Jesus said this too, but taught his desciples to listen to the truth of God and not to the lies of other men.</li>
<li>He saw anarchy as <i>a form of government</i>? Uh, say what? Anarchy specifically does not involve being governed..by anybody and is not a form of government.</li>
<li>If Proudhon is the founder of modern anarchist theory, then modern anarchist theory is warped and molded by a socialist who thought that anarchy was a type of government...let's see..<b>socialism&#160;?</b></li>
</ol>
<p>Proudhon, apparantly, was either stark raving mad, or a deciever and a usurper of the freedom and the inalienable rightrs of the people.</p>
<p>All this, that I just wrote is food for thought. College students and highschool students, too, please <i>think</i> about it. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELingeron_802e.html" title="User:Lingeron"><font color="#003366" face="Verdana">Sha</font></a><font color="#006666" face="Veranda">nnon</font><sup><a href="../../../l/i/n/User_talk%7ELingeron_ee69.html" title="User talk:Lingeron"><font color="#3906A2">duck talk</font></a></sup> 05:46, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Shannon, are you seriously suggesting that Paine and Jefferson were anarchists? Talk about hypocracy, Proudhon may have called anarchism a form a government, but Paine and Jefferson helped start a freaking government! How can you qoute men as being anarchist who specifically withheld power from most Americans and deliberately avoided direct democracy in order to insure the ascendency of the aristocratic elite. I'm talking about the original electoral process here if you're wondering. Its nice that you have heroes, but i agree with Blah, you seem more a libertarian/minarchist, rather than an anarchist. There are wiki pages on those topics, maybe you should check them out. Further, I think it likely that in describing anarchism as a form of government, Proudhon likely meant that it was a form of social organization. I think the majority of his writings would support this postulation but who knows, maybe Proudhon was a pinko commie marxist afterall right? Based upon my limited interaction with you, and upon the general content and voice of your writings here, I am prepared to begin calling myself an anti-shannon-anarchist-w/o-adjectives. Proudhon certianly wasn't perfect, but it is ridiculous to suggest that any of the American founding fathers were anarchist and everyone here (except maybe you) should be able to except that or else cease being an anarchist immediately.

<dd>After reading your user page i have more to say. You state, "The only government that I would even begin to trust is a libertarian Jeffersonian one" and "I am a Patriot to my country, the United States." These statements categorically prevent you from being an anarchist and contradict your assertion that "I believe in the inherent evil of all governments." I am not trying to be mean, but if you are going to accuse blah of "inability to use reason" then i think you should alter those statements.

<dd>No one in their right minds would call for abrogation of any form of state in the Jefferson era. What was unique about Jefferson democracy is that government was to be a servitude to those who consent to it.

<dd>It's interesting, and quite possibly worth mentioning, that both individualist and communist anarchism have strong roots in the enlightenment (Rosseau stradles both; Locke, and the American founding fathers are particularly relevant for individualist anarchism; Hegel and the French utopian socialists are relevant for communist anarchism). I'd like to see something about this in the <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origins_of_anarchism.html" title="Origins of anarchism">Origins of anarchism</a> article, though I'm not sure I'm competent to write it myself.

<dd>About Roussau, the individualists are against Roussau's social contract theory which advocated that the individual will be subordinated to the "general will." Proudhon spoke against it too.

<p><b>You people are unbelievable in your ignorance and the ease to which you get brainwashed by subversive propaganda.</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Learn to read. I said that Paine and Jefferson came up with the ideas for a minarchist government whereby the freedom and equality of the people would be protected. Have you read Paine and Jefferson? You are attacking the wrong men. If you want to rightfully attack an American forefather attack Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, and others.</li>
<li>I never said they were anarchists. I do say, though that Jefferson expressed his admiration for anarchism. If he had suggested it at a congressional meeting he probably would have been shot or lynched or they just would have impeached him. (Something that many of them wanted to do anyway.)</li>
<li>Being patriotic to your country and anarchism are not mutually exclusive. Sounds like you have been reading too much Communist propaganda. Communists just love to subvert governments and China is trying to subvert this one right now. I personally would love to overthrow the fascist-socialist state we're in right now and get back our freedom. But Maoism is not something I would have in mind in the way of freedom.</li>
<li>Blah and Bockade, since you think you know the ideologies that are best for me, let me find one for you. Hmm, maybe subverting your current government into a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist.html" title="Communist">dictatorship</a><a href="../../../t/o/t/Totalitarian_state.html" title="Totalitarian state">totalitarian state</a> would be appropriate. Or perhaps, as you are incapable of reading comprehension or the most rudimentary thought, working in a convenience store, rather than editing what used to be an encyclopedia would be a good idea for you. Or maybe, how about going and fucking yourself. Now, after having baited me with your ignorant and idiotic comments, go running to the admins and report me for PAing you, thereby proving beyond any shadow of a doubt how <i>unanarchistic</i> yet <i>socialistic</i> you really are.</li>

Anarchists, from Proudhon on (perhaps even before) have been generally understood as socialists. To posit a sharp distinction between anarchism and socialism (such that Proudhon wouldn't qualify as an anarchist!) along with the belief that liberals like Jefferson are especially relevant to anarchism, while it might make an interesting area to study, would be original (and controversial) research, and so inappropriate for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../v/o/l/User%7EVoluntarySlave_e88b.html" title="User:VoluntarySlave">VoluntarySlave</a> 07:47, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I removed it because this is an article about anarchism, not about non-anarchists who influenced anarchism. To have Jefferson be the only non-anarchist cited as an influence in the article is to absurdly overweight him. However, I thought we did have, and we probably should have, another paragraph in the Origins section pointing out that anarchism did not spring fully formed from the mind of Godwin, but was in part a continuation of earlier political tendencies; and that should include Jefferson. I'll try and write something (and incorporate the references you and Intangible have put in the Jefferson section). <a href="../../../v/o/l/User%7EVoluntarySlave_e88b.html" title="User:VoluntarySlave">VoluntarySlave</a> 19:24, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
