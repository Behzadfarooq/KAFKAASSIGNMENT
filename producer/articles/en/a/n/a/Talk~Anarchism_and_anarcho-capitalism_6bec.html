<p>I'd rather say that the socialist anarchists interpret it literally, while anarcho-capitalists use the word in its more narrow sense. Also, claiming that socialist anarchists generalize "archon" is one thing, but that they do it "leniently" is slightly POV, without doubt.

<p>After looking over this article I just have to laugh at all the writing devoted to disputing whether anarcho-capitalism is a form of anarchism. It's ok to mention a dispute but it goes on to a nauseating degree. I don't think most readers coming here for information care about the dispute over whether any philosophy put forth as a type of anarchism is a "true form of anarchism." <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheIndividualist_25e6.html" title="User:TheIndividualist">TheIndividualist</a> 23:56, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's probably true. But, then again, the issue has never been over whether or not anarcho-capitalism exists or calls itself anarchism. The issue has been about anarcho-capitalists attempting to give themselves an anarchist "pedigree" by retroactively injecting themselves into anarchist history, which is just as silly. --AaronS 01:19, 27 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>They do have an anarchist "pedigree." They come from the US where individualist anarchism originated. Rothbard was turned on to individualist anarchism by Tucker and Spooner. He accepted the early individualist anarchist support for a free market. The difference is he disagreed on what the consequences would be. He though a free market would still have profit. Tucker and Spooner thought competition would eliminate profit. But, of course that's flawed economics. The system that the early individualists want to implement would still have profit. The labor theory of value is erroneous. There is no natural reason that laissez-faire would eliminate profit. There is nothing exploitative about profit. They were fooled by the labor theory of value which was popular at the time. Economics has advanced since then. Any individualist today that tries to hold on to the labor theory of value is embarrassing themselves. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheIndividualist_25e6.html" title="User:TheIndividualist">TheIndividualist</a> 01:29, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"Pedigree" is a straw man that amounts to exactly the same argument: "ancap is a true form of anarchism"/"no it isn't". To put a finer point on it: ancaps claim influence from particular strains of anarchism, and other anarchists say that their claim is too tenuous to credit. That's it. Arguments about "pedigree", and "tradition", and "real anarchism" all devolve to the same issue-- which is the defining issue that divides ancaps from anarchism in general, which is the point of this article, so it seems a legit topic to go on and on about. . . --<a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESaswann_93bc.html" title="User:Saswann">Saswann</a> 21:06, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is no doubt that anarcho-capitalism was influenced by early anarchism. And there's no doubt that anarcho-capitalists support private property and a free market. There is no doubt that they differ from anarcho-communists on that. There's no doubt that anarcho-capitalists don't think profit is exploitation. There's no doubt that they're different from all the other anarchists on that account. That's why their philosophy has its own name.

<dd>I reallyt dubt ancap was influenced by any form of anarchism at all. My theory is that it was thought up by some US college boys who only learnt about anarchism from a pocket dictionary. // <a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELiftarn_fddd.html" title="User:Liftarn">Liftarn</a>
<dl>
<dd>I'd say that's an exaggeration. There are definitely some anarchist influences, but they are only a small part of it. Really it's just American-style <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarianism.html" title="Libertarianism">libertarianism</a> with a bit more teeth.

<p>Capitalism is the only possible economic practice that doesn't require state intervention. Maybe anarcho-socialism should be the theory that is constantly derided in this manner.

<p>Lots of sources are being miscited or improperly used here. For example, the MS encarta article (which needs to be specifically cited as the UK MS encarta) states, "Since World War II this tradition (individualist anarchism) has been reborn and modified in the United States as anarcho-capitalism or libertarianism."</p>
<p>This source clearly indicates that anarcho-capitalism is a branch of the "tradition" of individualist anarchism. It does NOT state that anarcho-capitalism is a form of anarchism. It might imply that, and in fact I would say that it does give such an implication, but that isn't enough to use as a source for the statement "several scholars consider anarcho-capitalism to be a form of anarchism". To source a controversial claim like that the scholar in question should say so directly, otherwise any time they ever refer to anarcho-capitalism it could be taken to be an implicit endorsement of AC as a form of anarchism. This is far too weak a standard, but this standard the same source could be used to claim that american libertarianism is a form of anarchism, something american libertarians and probably the people be cited here would themselves disagree with. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlahblahblahblahblahblah_a472.html" title="User:Blahblahblahblahblahblah">Blahblahblahblahblahblah</a> 12:14, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article is CRAZY! What a mess. What is the object of it? It seems to arguments that anarcho-capitalism is not a form of anarchism and people defending it as being one, or something like that.

<p>I oppose the deletion of this page as it addresses an issue within anarchism that warrants inclusion in wikipedia. attempts to delete this page is obvious POV pushing. this is a major issue and cannot be done justice by simply merging it with the criticisms section in the ancap article. this is apparent to any editor who is not operating under extreme bias. <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlockader_5d3e.html" title="User:Blockader">Blockader</a> 17:33, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Attemping to delete the article doesn't look like any "POV pushing" to me. How about changing the title? The title is what's making this ariticle POV.

<dd>Yes they are in the view of virtually everyone except ancaps and a few lazy academics. Even those who describe it as anarchism generally recognise it is from the right-wing libertarian tradition and not from the entirely leftwing anarchist tradition. It's an appropriation of the term by right-wingers that is seen by many anarchists (including myself) as hostile and wrecking. All forms of anarchism are generally united in what they oppose (the state and capitalism) and vary simply on what they advocate. "Anarcho"-capitalism does not fit into this. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonnachadelong_ddd0.html" title="User:Donnachadelong">Donnacha</a> 11:04, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<b>libertarian</b> <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/libertarianism" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/libertarianism" rel="nofollow">libertarianism</a> n.<br />
1. a person who advocates liberty, esp. with regard to thought or conduct.<br />
2. a person who maintains the doctrine of free will (distinguished from necessitarian).<br />
-adjective<br />
3. advocating liberty or conforming to principles of liberty.<br />
4. maintaining the doctrine of free will.<br /></p>
<p>Calling libertrians <i>right wing</i> is a common error made by left-wingers. Libertarians are distinctly <b>not right wing anymore than they are left wing</b>. They have only one common interest and that is freedom from government intervention. Libertarianism is based on <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical_liberalism.html" title="Classical liberalism">Classical liberalism</a>. While the Libertarian Party calls for as little government intervention as possible, <b>radical libertarians are anarchists who want no government at all</b>. For left-leaning anarchists to call radical libertarians "right-wing and not anarchists" is based on nothing more than arrogance and ignorance.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact the idea of an anarchist being either left or right wing is ludicrous, as the left and right wings are allegiances to parties or state politics. Thus the concept of <i>left-wing</i> anarchism is an absurd impossibility. It can't ever exist. <a href="../../../i/m/a/User%7EImagination_d%C3%A9brid%C3%A9e_f703.html" title="User:Imagination débridée">Imagination débridée</a> 13:58, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello again wolfy. You'll not that the words right and wing (hyphenated) are before the word libertarian, thus giving them the form of an adjective. In common English use, the use of an adjective to describe a word means that the word does not always mean what the adjective accords it. Right-wing libertarians are those who oppose democracy and egalitarians and exclusively act against the state and not other forms of oppression - people like the so-called "anarcho"-capitalists. As for the distinction between left and right, you couldn't be more wrong. Left and right define the social question - left is in favour of egalitarianism and redistribution, right is in favour of elitism and social divisions. That's why the the authoritarian/libertarian distinction is also used to define the relationship to the state. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonnachadelong_ddd0.html" title="User:Donnachadelong">Donnacha</a> 17:05, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Donnacha, please remember to be civil. There is no need to attack someone with an English lesson intended to belittle. I have to say, with everyone defending their POV strongly, I think this whole article is beyond recovery. There is no need to have an article comparing and contrasting two subjects. It will be almost entirely based on <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">POVs</a>, and definitions that can’t be proven. Keep in mind <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a> about changing what people think, it is about defining the facts. The whole article is rotting with weasel words. No one will change anyone else’s mind on this talk page. The anarcho-capitalists will continue to think it is a form of anarchy. The anarchists will think it is not. There is no use putting my opinion into the mess because it will help nothing. Lets discuss ways to make the article (and not the title) non-pov before we even go to the title.</dd>
<dd>Stop using weasel words. How many is “many”? Take out these words and replace them with names of famous anarchists and anarcho-captialists who have written about the subject. Then cite your sources. I strongly suggest those who believe one thing only work on the parts they believe, and not the parts they don’t. Please leave the parts you disagree with alone, and let others develop it. A Yankee could not keep an article NPOV if they were comparing the Yankees to the Redsocks.</dd>
<dd>And please don’t use the article to convince others that the way you think is correct. Simply point out facts (or claims made by writers that can be sourced). This is all I have to say from the RFC page. <a href="../../../d/o/g/User%7EDogNewTricks_2e96.html" title="User:DogNewTricks">Connor K.</a> 18:59, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I'm happy to work on developing a NPOV version of the article, but it's not POV to say that the vast majority of anarchists worldwide say that "anarcho"-capitalism is an oxymoron. Not only is it not POV, but there's already a cite for that in the article. And saying this is like the Yankess to the Redsocks is rubbish, this is like the entire World Series versus a team that 's decided that you can play baseball with a golf club and insists all baseball is is hitting a ball. The whole purpose of this article is to focus on the rejection of "anarcho"-capitalism by anarchists in the historical tradition. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonnachadelong_ddd0.html" title="User:Donnachadelong">Donnacha</a> 22:31, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Whoever you are Donnacha, you are nasty. I wouldn't for the life of me, want the likes of you making decisions for me, that's for sure. I know what a damned adjective is. You, on the other hand, don't have a clue what a libertarian is. There is <b>no such thing as a right-wing libertarian</b>. <i>That</i> is an oxymoron, if I ever heard one. The classical liberals were the original libertarians in the U.S., they were the ones that modern (U.S.) libertarianism is based on, and they were the left-wing of their day. They decidedly were not elistist and fought against the priveleged few. If you're going to discuss U.S. history and politics then learn about it first. Otherwise it is most definitely you who are talking out of her ass. <a href="../../../i/m/a/User%7EImagination_d%C3%A9brid%C3%A9e_f703.html" title="User:Imagination débridée">Imagination débridée</a> 00:19, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Some of the content may be POV against anarcho-capitalism; some of it is POV for anarcho-capitalism. Last time I was here, the article was a horrible mess of content written by <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">User:RJII</a> and me. I tried to clean it up, but someone kept re-inserting stuff RJII wrote, which was bloated to say the least (I won't even go into the POV). Some of what I wrote may be biased, I apologise - at the time I wrote it, I was trying to balance opposing POV, so I may have been too heavy in some areas. Anyway, there still exists pro-ancap bias in the article, so keep that in mind too before you dismiss this article as "anarcho-capitalism bashing" or whatever. -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfinity0_7a16.html" title="User:Infinity0"><span style="color:red;">infinity</span></a><b><a href="../../../i/n/f/User_talk%7EInfinity0_df0a.html" title="User talk:Infinity0"><span style="color:red;">0</span></a></b> 00:29, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your comments, Infinity0. The title of this article alone (Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism) really does suggest that anarcho-capitalism is not anarchism - that they are 2 different things. That alone is heavy duty POV.

I've been moving it to "anti-capitalist anarchism and anarcho-capitalism" and "anti-capitalist anarchism and pro-capitalist anarchism" but it keeps getting moved back.

If you are afraid of new people reading the title and then inferring that anarchism and ancapism are different, I don't think they will. The very first paragraph explains the content of the rest of the article. If anything, the name ancapism is itself POV, since that positively asserts itself to be part of anarchism. But in any case, this point is null, since whenever this article is linked on this wiki, there is always a section explaining the summary of this dispute. -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfinity0_7a16.html" title="User:Infinity0"><span style="color:red;">infinity</span></a><b><a href="../../../i/n/f/User_talk%7EInfinity0_df0a.html" title="User talk:Infinity0"><span style="color:red;">0</span></a></b> 16:28, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Donnacha, anything that doesn't agree with you is extreme pov pushing. And why can't you just be civil? Is is it necessary to be so hostile and condescending to everyone you talk to? You said, "there is no such thing as "pro-capitalist" anarchism". I and a number of other editors can testify that there is such a thing as we are all pro-capitalist anarchists.

<dd>Nope, it's just you people who continue to over-emphasis a right-wing attempt to take over the term anarchist like right-wingers took over the the term libertarian that is extreme POV pushing. I'm an anarchist from Europe where, if considered at all, so-called "anarcho"-capitalists are laughed at. You can claim a two-wheeled machine is a car if you like, but people will laugh and point out it's a bicycle. You are clearly a sock-puppet of everyone's favourite disruptive editor coming out with exactly the same kind of nonsense you have done in the past. Capitalism is authoritarian, thus inconsistent with anarchism. Full stop. History and any reasonable analysis of what anarchism stands for agrees with me. Some loony libertarian who clearly spent too much time in Ayn Rand's company and a few web-warriors agree with you - doesn't make you right.

Historian Ralph Raico regards it as "a form of individualist anarchism" (<a href="http://www.mises.org/story/1787" class="external text" title="http://www.mises.org/story/1787" rel="nofollow"><i>Authentic German Liberalism...</i></a>). Simon Tormey, in his book <i>Anti-Capitalism: A Beginner's Guide</i> places no anti-capitalist restriction on being an individualist anarchist: "Pro-capitalist anarchism is, as one might expect, particularly prevalent in the US where it feeds on the strong individualist and libertarian currents that have always been a part of the American political imaginary. To return to the point, however, there are individualist anarchists who are most certainly not anti-capitalist and there are those who may well be."</p>
<p>Some anarcho-capitalists argue that their philosophy is related to <a href="../../../i/n/d/Individualist_anarchism.html" title="Individualist anarchism">individualist anarchism</a>. They believe a major difficulty in resolving the debate is due to the conflicting definitions of the words "<a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a>" and "<a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalism.html" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a>" as used by the two sides. The traditions that object to the term anarcho-capitalism tend to use the term "anarchism" to refer to political movements that are both <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-statist.html" title="Anti-statist">anti-statist</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-capitalist.html" title="Anti-capitalist">anti-capitalist</a>.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since December 2006" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Conversely, <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarians.html" title="Libertarians">libertarians</a> and anarcho-capitalists most commonly use the term "anarchism" to refers to any philosophy that opposes all forms of initiatory coercion (without specifications regarding economic systems).<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[9]</a></sup> However, even this is disputed, as many anarchists argue that capitalism is inherently coercive.<sup id="_ref-anarchist-coercive_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-anarchist-coercive" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Lysander Spooner's articles, such as <a href="http://www.lysanderspooner.org/notreason.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.lysanderspooner.org/notreason.htm" rel="nofollow"><i>No Treason</i></a> and the <a href="http://www.lysanderspooner.org/LetterToBayard.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.lysanderspooner.org/LetterToBayard.htm" rel="nofollow"><i>Letter to Thomas Bayard</i></a>, were widely reprinted in early anarcho-capitalist journals, and his ideas — especially his individualist critique of the state and his defense of the right to ignore or withdraw from it — were often cited by anarcho-capitalists. Spooner was staunchly opposed to government interference in economic matters, and supported a "right to acquire property [...] as one of the natural, inherent, inalienable rights of men [...] one which government has no power to infringe [...]".<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[11]</a></sup> Like all anarchists, he opposed government regulation: "All legislative restraints upon the rate of interest are arbitrary and tyrannical restraints upon a man's natural capacity amid natural right to hire capital, upon which to bestow his labor."<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[12]</a></sup> He was particularly vocal, however, in opposing any collusion between banks and government, and argued that the monopolistic privileges that the government granted to a few bankers were the source of many social and economic ills.</p>
<p>Benjamin Tucker supported private ownership of the product of labor, which he believed entailed a rejection of both collective and capitalist ownership. He was a staunch advocate of the <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutualist.html" title="Mutualist">mutualist</a> form of recompensing labor, which holds to "<a href="../../../c/o/s/Cost_the_limit_of_price.html" title="Cost the limit of price">Cost the limit of price</a>". He also advocated a free <a href="../../../m/a/r/Market_economy.html" title="Market economy">market economy</a>, which he believed was prohibited by capitalist monopoly of credit and land backed by the state. He believed that anyone who wishes should be allowed to engage in the banking business and issue their private currency without needing special permission from government, and that unused land should not be restricted to those who wished to use it. He believed that if these and other coercive actions were eliminated that profit in economic transactions would be rendered nearly impossible because of increased availability of capital to all individuals and resulting increased competition in business. Accepting the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labor_theory_of_value.html" title="Labor theory of value">labor theory of value</a> and the resulting "cost principle" as a premise marks one of mutualism's main conflicts with anarcho-capitalism. Although his self-identification as a socialist and sympathy for the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labor_movement.html" title="Labor movement">labor movement</a> led to hostility from some early anarcho-capitalists such as <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_LeFevre_3104.html" title="Robert LeFevre">Robert LeFevre</a>, others, such as Murray Rothbard, embraced his critique of the state and claimed that he defined his "socialism" not in terms of opposition to a free market or private property, but in opposition to government privileges for business. However, individualists argue that capitalism cannot be maintained in the absence of the state. For example, Kevin Carson argues, "As a mutualist anarchist, I believe that expropriation of surplus value — i.e., capitalism — cannot occur without state coercion to maintain the privilege of usurer, landlord, and capitalist. It was for this reason that the free market mutualist Benjamin Tucker — from whom right-libertarians selectively borrow — regarded himself as a libertarian socialist." Tucker characterized the economic demands of Proudhon and Warren by saying, "though opposed to socializing the ownership of capital, they aimed nevertheless to socialize its effects by making its use beneficial to all instead of a means of impoverishing the many to enrich the few [...] Absolute Free Trade; free trade at home, as well as with foreign countries; the logical carrying out of the Manchester doctrine; <i>laissez-faire</i> the universal rule."<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Anarcho-capitalism is sometimes viewed by those sympathetic to it as a form of individualist anarchism, despite the fact that the original individualist anarchists universally rejected capitalism (i.e., they opposed profit, which is seen as a fundamental characteristic of capitalism). Organizations such as mutualist.org remain dedicated to "free market anticapitalism," while individualists like Larry Gambone explicitly state that all capitalism is state capitalism. Nonetheless, anarcho-capitalist Wendy McElroy considers herself to be an individualist, while admitting that the original individualists were universally anticapitalist. In addition, historian <a href="http://freeweb.supereva.com/super.freeweb/eurolibertarians/anarcho.htm" class="external text" title="http://freeweb.supereva.com/super.freeweb/eurolibertarians/anarcho.htm" rel="nofollow">Guglielmo Piombini</a> refers anarcho-capitalism as a form of individualist anarchism, though he offers no support for this statement. Collectivist anarchist author Iain McKay and historian Peter Sabatini both argue that anarcho-capitalism is fundamentally opposed to individualist anarchism.</p>
<p>The similarity to anarcho-capitalism in regard to private defense of liberty and property is probably best seen in a quote by 19th-century individualist anarchist <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victor_Yarros_4f89.html" title="Victor Yarros">Victor Yarros</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anarchism means no government, but it does not mean no laws and no coercion. This may seem paradoxical, but the paradox vanishes when the Anarchist definition of government is kept in view. Anarchists oppose government, not because they disbelieve in punishment of crime and resistance to aggression, but because they disbelieve in compulsory protection. Protection and taxation without consent is itself invasion; hence Anarchism favors a system of voluntary taxation and protection.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the claim is controversial, some scholars regard <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalism</a> as being a form of individualism anarchism.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[15]</a></sup> However, other scholars, and many individualist anarchists themselves, do not accept anarcho-capitalism as a form of individualist anarchism, individualist or not, as they assert that <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a> is fundamentally opposed to <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalism.html" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a>.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[16]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[17]</a></sup> As individualist anarchist Joe Peacott says:</p>

Eventually, in the 1950s, <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murray_Rothbard_a505.html" title="Murray Rothbard">Murray Rothbard</a> coined the term "<a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalism</a>" to define his anti-statist, laissez-faire capitalist philosophy.</p>
<p>Rothbard noted that while "strongly tempted," he could not call his ideology "individualist anarchism" because "Spooner and Tucker have in a sense preempted that name for their doctrine and that from that doctrine I have certain differences." Rothbard also supported unregulated banking, as Tucker and other individualists did, but believed that Tucker and Spooner had a flawed understanding of economics to believe that unregulated banking would eliminate profit from interest. Tucker says interest rates are ultimately determined by the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_value_of_money.html" title="Time value of money">time value of money</a>, rather than the supply of money and that interest/profit would still exist in a free banking environment. He says: "it has been particularly distressing to me as an ardent admirer of Spooner and Tucker to find that their followers have emphasized and concentrated on their totally fallacious monetary views almost to the [exclusion of all else and even bring them forth as a panacea for all economic and social ills." <a href="http://www.mises.org/journals/jls/20_1/20_1_2.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mises.org/journals/jls/20_1/20_1_2.pdf" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Rothbard suggested that individualist anarchists drop the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labor_theory_of_value.html" title="Labor theory of value">labor theory of value</a> which he believed to be erroneous and leading to a false conclusion that profit was exploitative or unnatural in laissez-faire. Rothbard sought to introduce Lockean property rights and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marginalism.html" title="Marginalism">marginalism</a> into individualist anarchism:</p>

<p>Rothbard also rejected Tucker and Spooner's support of a system where there is no written law. He says, "There would be no rational or objective body of law which the juries would in any sense—even morally—be bound to consult, nor even any judicial precedents, since each jury would have the power to decide both the facts and the law of every case strictly ad hoc. With no guides or standards to follow, even juries with the best of will could not be expected to arrive at just or even libertarian decisions." Instead, he argues, "It would not be a very difficult task for Libertarian lawyers and jurists to arrive at a rational and objective code of libertarian legal principles and procedures."<sup id="_ref-Spooner-Tucker_Doctrine_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spooner-Tucker_Doctrine" title="">[19]</a></sup>}}</p>
<p>Individualist anarchist Laurance Labadie argued however:</p>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">Mere common sense would suggest that any court would be influenced by experience; and any free-market court or judge would in the very nature of things have some precedents guiding them in their instructions to a jury. But since no case is exactly the same, a jury would have considerable say about the heinousness of the offence in each case, realising that circumstances alter cases, and prescribing penalty accordingly. This appeared to Spooner and Tucker to be a more flexible and equitable administration of justice possible or feasible, human beings being what they are...</td>

In comparison, the University of Nevada ain't quite as impressive, is it? <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonnachadelong_ddd0.html" title="User:Donnachadelong">Donnacha</a> 01:37, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What a mess is this! As far as I've understood what's happening here, what I see is that there is a lack of a straight definition of the word "anarchy". As I see, some are saying that anarchy implies ant-capitalism, so an-cap is not a kind of anarchy, while other argue that an-cap is an individualist anarchy. Am I right or should I read the whole talk and article again? According to the Liddell &amp; Scott Greek-English Dictionary says about <i>anarchía</i> (= "anarchy"), the word means lack of head = leader, lawlessness, etc. As far as I know, in anarcho-capitalism, there's no head; the economic flux should move the whole thing without the existence of state at least on economic topics, so it should be a kind of anarchy... or not? --<a href="../../../i/m/a/User%7EImaglang_ddb6.html" title="User:Imaglang">Neigel von Teighen</a> 20:27, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's just as legitimate a form of anarchism as any other, even more so as far as I'm concerned. The collectivists won't admit it because, economically, it goes against what they believe in. I, on the other hand don't believe there's any such thing as communist-anarchism.

<dd>No, there cannot be a communist-anarchism: communism wants the State to take anything on its hands! No, anarchism is, according to the etymology, <i>any</i> ideology that wants the lack of any head nor leading (<i>an-archía</i>) and anarcho-cap wants that for economical reasons. Then, this article must be rewritten so the differences between left-anarchism and an-cap are clearly and accurately stated; the difference is not in that one is anarchism and the other is not, but the reasons why state should be abolished (anarchism, because considering state as a repressor of social &amp; moral individual liberties and an-cap, because of an exaggeration of Adam Smith's doctrines). --<a href="../../../i/m/a/User%7EImaglang_ddb6.html" title="User:Imaglang">Neigel von Teighen</a> 01:17, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>God some of you people talk rubbish. Communism has nothing to do with the state, not even in Marxist doctrine. You really haven't got a clue, do you? Go read Kropotkin, Goldman or Berkman before spouting off. Capitalism requires owners of capital and bosses, who count as leaders, thus it is inconsistent with anarchism - get it? Libertarian communism, the most extreme form of anarchism, has equality of ownership, thus the greatest freedom possible for all, not the elite minority that would have freedom in the oppression that "anarcho"-capitalism would bring about. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonnachadelong_ddd0.html" title="User:Donnachadelong">Donnacha</a> 01:58, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's not true. Communism, whether the state form or that anarcho form, is authority over the individual. Deciding on one's own free will to work as an employee of someone else is not inconsistent with anarchism. Not everyone wants the hassle of running their own business. To oppose the right of contract, which anarcho-communists do oppose, is very anti-freedom.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 02:04, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Two words - <i>voluntary cooperation</i>. Anarchist communists don't <i>oppose</i> contracts, we, living in the real world, recognise that most people would rather be free than someone else's slave. Contracts enforced by private security without any legal or state framework of defence against exploitation is what exists in most of Brazil and it's a brutal, murderous situation. You propose a return to the worst abuses of the early industrial revolution. I propose freedom, freedom to associate voluntarily or chose not to. Freedom to cooperate or to do you own thing.

<dd>"Money is a restriction on trade." Never taken economics 101 have you? Money facilitates trade. It relieves us of the need to barter. And it doesn't "distort perceptions of value", whatever that means. Value is always in the eye of the beholder. No one's labor is worth one cent more than what someone is willing to pay for it.

<p>Back onto ideological discussions? First: this is an encyclopedia, not a political forum! The article must be "scientifically" written... I return to the etymology: anarchy is <b>any</b> form of lack of leadership, not necessarily regulation (some one mentioned contracts as a way of control, but these are internal regulations and thus can be internally broken). The question is very simple: what want anarcho-caps? The lack of any state that regulate society because economy will do its work by itself. If this is not an anarchy form, then I don't know what the hell it is. On the other hand, a coherent form of anarcho-communism is contradictory because communism talks about proletarian dictatorship and a <i>popular state</i> authority over capitalists... No, "standard" anarchism wants the elimination of state as it is a form of external repression of individual liberties. But the result of both anarchism and an-cap is the same: no state; the reasons are the difference and <b>this</b> should be the article about! --<a href="../../../i/m/a/User%7EImaglang_ddb6.html" title="User:Imaglang">Neigel von Teighen</a> 15:27, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This article cannot be scientifically written. All that can be done is to write out what people's opinions are. In the end, there is no "truth" on whether anarcho-capitalism is anarchism or not. I myself really don't give a shit, it's just a word. When I use anarchism, I implicitly mean anti-social hierarchy, which includes capitalism, but other people will think differently.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In short, your statement "if this is not an anarchy form, then I don't know what the hell it is" is extremely unscientific, and just your opinion. There is no correct answer to "is ancapism anarchism?" (if you start with capitalist assumptions, you get yes; if you start off with collectivist assumptions, you get no; and the correctness of these assumptions is outside the scope of this article) and we should not portray that there is a correct answer in this article. -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfinity0_7a16.html" title="User:Infinity0"><span style="color:red;">infinity</span></a><b><a href="../../../i/n/f/User_talk%7EInfinity0_df0a.html" title="User talk:Infinity0"><span style="color:red;">0</span></a></b> 15:31, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>the result of both anarchism and an-cap is the same: no state;</i> - this I disagree with. Anarchism is about government, of which the state is only one type of. (see many modern dictionaries as well as etymological def). The result of anarchism is not being governed. Most anarchists, and myself, would say this includes capitalism (private MOP, wage labour, etc etc). -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfinity0_7a16.html" title="User:Infinity0"><span style="color:red;">infinity</span></a><b><a href="../../../i/n/f/User_talk%7EInfinity0_df0a.html" title="User talk:Infinity0"><span style="color:red;">0</span></a></b> 15:34, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I know I'm right, but you're still wrong. History and the vast majority of anarchists disagree that anarchism is just anti-government. "Anarcho"-capitalists are a minority sect of libertarian wreckers who are seeking to discredit anarchism by associating it with its opposite (capitalism). Or maybe that's giving them too much credit, perhaps they're just just intellectually the children of the Reagan era where, as Michael Franti put it:</dd>

<p>I understand no one is <i>just</i> anti-government, but the abolition of leadership is the nucleus of the anarchist ideology.

<dl>
<dd>How does one enforce an economic contract? The social contract is a voluntary one, any individual is free to cooperate or not to - at any point in the process. Economic contracts, particularly when, as in capitalism, the means of production are owned by individuals, is an hierarchical relationship. One person owns the factor and contracts others to work for him. If they breach the contract, what then? "Anarcho"-capitalists support private security and, presumably, enforcement of contracts by them. That's a coercive relationship - do this or else... Thus, it's inconsistent with anarchism, which is fundamentally opposed to coercive authority in nearly all its forms (some exceptions, such as Chomky's example of the parent who uses force to stop their child running into the street). It's also an irrational proposition from the point of view of capitalists - the origins of the bourgeois state are in the realisation of capitalists that providing these services could more effectively be done by a centralised state that charged the workers (through taxation) to pay for them. That's what the police are - defenders of the capitalist system. What capitalists dislike in government is not its existence, it's how social pressures have forced governments to make limited concessions to the people and put limited controls on the freedom of capitalists (environmental controls, labour laws, etc). <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonnachadelong_ddd0.html" title="User:Donnachadelong">Donnacha</a> 14:05, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>According to your post, Donnacha, what I see is that the problem to see whether something is anarchism is if it defends the abolition of social hierarchy. You say, then, that anarcho-capitalism bases itself on economic contracts and these are always hierarchical (hierarchy is etymologically "the government of those having divine power" &gt; "gov. of the superior"), how do you or anarchism analyze the situation of two successful traders making a business? I'd like to tell you that I'm asking you these things because I want to fully understand what is discussed here before I try to edit the article...

<dd>(edit conflict)The economic contracts part of "anarcho"-capitalism isn't the main problem, it's its support for the ownership of the means of production combined with economic contracts. What you suggest, the situation of two successful traders, is not so much an issue if they are trading that which they made themselves. If, on the other hand, they are trading that which was made in <i>their</i> factory with <i>their</i> tools by people in <i>their</i> pay, then the point is that the hierarchical problem is not between the two, but between each and their workforce - those who they exploited to become successful traders. Fundamentally, the argument is not so much about what system would be in place in an anarchy - every suggestion or theory is guesswork (as most theorists acknowledge) due to the impossibility of knowing what people would decide to if they were truly free. The fundamental problem with "anarcho"-capitalism is that, in defending the continuation of private ownership of the means of production, the result of the removal of the state would be an extreme oligarchy, not anarchy. Anarchy is about the maximisation of freedom for the all, thus it necessitates redistribution because freedom is inconsistent with inequality. How can a person be free when the system demands that they sell their labour to survive? Currently, the state provides a safety net in most developed countries, but take a look at the situation in Brazil or India where slavery continues to exist. "Anarcho"-capitalism would lead to a situation such as that which exists in rural Brazil - you should read about the history of the MST for more details (individual ownership of massive tracts of land, murderous private security firms, widespread poverty and homelessness, etc.). The aim of true anarchism is to tear down <i>everything</i> that prevents true freedom, all hierarchies, all oppressive infrastructure and then allow humanity to develop its own system with that freedom. The prediction is that, in this situation, a new society would be one that would not develop into new hierarchies. The flip-side of this prediction is that the tearing down necessary for anarchy to develop would have to be broadly based and broadly supported by the majority of people, thus creating the base needed for the new society to be truly free and equal. If this did not exist, anarchy can never be created by a minority without mass support. I hope that's clear, feel free to query any bits that are not. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonnachadelong_ddd0.html" title="User:Donnachadelong">Donnacha</a> 01:05, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's not a <i>flaw</i>, its a potential danger. What stops that happening now? Nothing more nor less than the current oppressors. I'm more confident in an evolutionary anarchism rather than a revolutionary one as I history tends to show that something born of violence dies in violence. What will stop someone taking over? Well, if you dismantle armies and police and every other armed force of oppression, they'll be lacking the machinery to impose their will. Thus, if people have created an anarchy and believe in an anarchy, they will fight tooth and nail to maintain it, as they have done elsewhere. Maybe they'll win, maybe they'll lose, but that's the danger with any attempt to change society. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonnachadelong_ddd0.html" title="User:Donnachadelong">Donnacha</a> 12:30, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Freedom is inconsistent with inequality." The "anarcho"-communist position is absurd. Freedom enables inequality. Inequality is the natural result of liberty. As Benjamin Tucker said, ""If I go through life free and rich, I shall not cry because my neighbor, equally free, is richer. Liberty will ultimately make all men rich; it will not make all men equally rich. Authority may (and may not) make all men equally rich in purse; it certainly will make them equally poor in all that makes life best worth living." Murray Rothbard was right when he said that at the root of "anarcho"-communism, "lies a profound hatred of individual excellence, a denial of the natural or intellectual superiority of some men over others, and a desire to tear down every individual to the level of a communal ant-heap. In the name of a phony "humanism," an irrational and profoundly anti-human egalitarianism is to rob every individual of his specific and precious humanity." The individualist anarchist Max Stirner would also agree.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 01:36, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

Freedom <i>for all</i> is impossible with the extremes of economic inequality presented by private ownership of the means of production. To argue that <i>inequality is the natural result of liberty</i> when referring to economic relations is the height of elitism. No man can create wealth on his own, it can <i>only</i> be created through exploitation of one form or another. This is why anarcho-communists argue for a non-monetary system, as the monetarisation of everything is a barrier to freedom. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonnachadelong_ddd0.html" title="User:Donnachadelong">Donnacha</a> 12:30, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Anarcho-communists think working for someone else is coercive even if it's voluntary.</i> - No. Arguments against capitalism is that wage labour is NOT voluntary, but subtly coerced due to economic inequality between the worker and the boss. The worker needs the job more than the boss needs the worker. That is, the money paid is worth more to the worker than to the boss, exposing a huge flaw in the supposed standard of "value" that we call money. -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfinity0_7a16.html" title="User:Infinity0"><span style="color:red;">infinity</span></a><b><a href="../../../i/n/f/User_talk%7EInfinity0_df0a.html" title="User talk:Infinity0"><span style="color:red;">0</span></a></b> 15:07, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The job is worth to the worker whatever he is willing to pay for that job. If you are hungry, you are willing to pay more for a hamburger than when you're not hungry. That doesn't mean that when you purchase a hamburger when you're hungry that the payment is involuntary. It just means your value judgement changed. Your purchase of a hamburger is voluntary whether you're hungry or not.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 18:57, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>The job is worth to the worker whatever he is willing to pay for that job.</i> - This is false in two ways.
<ol>
<li>There is a wide range of values which someone is willing to pay for anything; we all look for the best deal we can get. If we think we got a good deal, most of us will keep quiet.</li>
<li>His situation affects his value-judgement of the job. Something external to the job can somehow affects his value-judgement of it? How possibly can that be? No, the reality must be that what he is willing to pay is not the value of the job, but <b>the value of the job (in a neutral situation) PLUS the value of his situation</b>.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>In short, the assumption that "money paid == judgement of value of item traded" is utterly illogical, and highly flawed. In your hamburger scenario, what the hungery person pays for is not only the hamburger, but the hamburger <b>and the satisfying of his hunger</b>. It this LAST HIDDEN FACTOR which is exploited.</dd>

<dd>One question you have not asked yourself is, what is the hamburger worth to the seller, who sells it at different prices to different people, who each have their own value-judgements of it?

<dd>The seller wishes to exploit the situations of the buyers in order to create as much new value for himself. When he sells hamburgers at different prices to different buyers, that is only because the different buyers are willing to pay different prices. So what is the value of the hamburger to the seller? Who knows? What can be measured is the value of the hamburger <b>plus the value of the situation of the buyers</b>. In short, the seller makes profit not from the product itself, but from the inequalities and inconsistencies in human society. -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfinity0_7a16.html" title="User:Infinity0"><span style="color:red;">infinity</span></a><b><a href="../../../i/n/f/User_talk%7EInfinity0_df0a.html" title="User talk:Infinity0"><span style="color:red;">0</span></a></b> 21:52, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Of course it's a value judgement. When you purchase something, you're making a value judgement. But, you're right that money paid for X does not equal the subject's value judgement for X. X is actually valued more than the money paid. You value what you're purchasing more than you value them money that you're giving the other party in exchange. The object you're purchasing is valued by you as being worth more than the money. If you thought the object was worth the same or less than the money, you would keep the money. What is the value (usefulness) of money itself? The value is that prevents the need to look for someone to barter with. If you want bread, you don't have find a baker that wants a material object that you have. You just pay him with money, and he can use that money to pay for something that he actually wants. Money is simply an object (such as gold, shells (as ancient chinese used), salt, or tobacco (as in the early U.S)), that saves us from the need to engage in laborious bartering. Like any other object, you trade your labor with someone else in order to receive it, because you value it - you find it useful. And you, yourself, have to admit that you find it useful because you are not able to purchase things you want from the shops without it. You value money. You want money. Others don't want to trouble themselves by bartering with you. They prefer money in exchange so they don't have to barter. And money itself is the product of labor, like every other object we use that is not free (even in the case of shells because it takes labor to find them). <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 19:59, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Money facilitates trade. It relieves us of the need to barter.</i> - This is what you have been indoctrinated with. Look at what you have been taught, and see through the contradictions. Money poses as a standard of value. BUT value is subjective. (Again, see point above about money being worth different amounts to different people.) This creates distortions in perceptions of value and causes people to judge things differently than they would otherwise, because now they are pressurised to considering "money" as something with "value". Now, unlike everything else in the world which has "value", money is just a concept, so it can be increased whenever people (usu. those who control the money) feel like it, resulting new value being created out of nothing, which can be used, paradoxically, to obtain something.</p>
<p>Now, the more amount of money there is, the greater these distortions are. But what is money? Nothing. It's a concept. Humans invented it as a concept, but they never sat down to think of its consequences. All human progress has come about through human <b>activity</b> - that is, labour. Not through the spread and growth of an abstract idea.</p>
<p>I emphasis again that money restricts trade. Why? Simply because of these distortions. Because money is an absolute system used to represent a relative concept, it interferes with the process of trade and creates value out of nothing and destroys value to nothing.</p>
<p><i>Apparently you have a Marxist background and hold the mystical "labor theory of value" but it's nonsense.</i> - In fact, I agree that value is subjective, if you took the time to read my user page.

<dd>Money has tremendous value. It has value in simplifying trade. Without money, you have to find people will goods that you want that simultaneously want goods that you have. The value of money is its ability to facilitate trade by eliminating the need to barter. It's laugable that you say "money restricts trade." Without money, trade would be severely reduced. Why do you think people use money? Even the most primitive societies in the jungle use money, whether it's shells or something else. Very few people barter, because barter is much more difficult. On the labor theory of value, you say you don't have a labor theory of value, but obviously you have some kind of objective theory of value if you think that someone can receive a lower wage than he "should" be receiving. If you thought value was subjective then you would be fine with a person working for peanuts, because you would be in no position to judge whether his wage was proper.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 19:04, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You have not read any of my points, instead repeating exactly what they teach you in economic classes. If you look throughout history, in fact many societies even in the 17th century, before being invaded by colonial powers, were moneyless. You say, "Without money, trade would be severely reduced." - this may be true for today's society. However, this does not have to be true. If people gave and received without thinking of getting/giving something in exchange, trade would flourish. When we work, we all naturally produce a surplus, more than we need or want.</dd>

<dd>What you are saying is totally incoherent: "If people gave and received without thinking of getting/giving something in exchange, trade would flourish." I've got news for you. Trade is exchange. Gift giving is not trade. What you're referring to as "trade" is not trade. Anarcho-communists, which apparently you are one, advocating the abolition of trade, to be substituted with "giving" according to the needs of others. About wage, sure he would choose a higher wage but the person's free will who is paying him also has to be taken into account. He is not "being restricted by his boss." The boss doesn't owe him a thing. He has no obligation to even offer him a job at all.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 23:55, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Trade is exchange and distribution. It is irrelevant whether this exchange is done formally, as in "A for B", or unconditionally, as in "everyone {I make A. What I don't have a use for, I give to others.}"</dd>
<dd>You seem to suggest that because he made the agreement, he had equal control over the agreement as the other parties. This is not true. The person with more economic power has more control over economic agreements, more power to oppress the freedoms of others.</dd>
<dd>You also seem to think that because he made the agreement, he is happy with it. This is also clearly not always true.</dd>
<dd>You seem to think that "consent" makes everything OK. Well, everything everyone does in the world is with consent, obtained either by coercion or without, so this way of looking at this is useless, unless you want to imagine that the world is a utopia. Consent does not mean the subject is not being exploited. Exploitation means taking advantage of somebody's situation. Paying someone peanuts for hard work, because they have no other way of getting money, and is doing ridiculous things to obtain this money, is clearly exploitation. In fact, exploitation DEPENDS on consent to work. If the person does not consent to it, he would not be exploited.</dd>
<dd>You also seem to think that "free will" is everything. A person has "free will" to choose between choices he is able to make. In the case of the poorly-paid worker, he has no choice to work at a better rate. He has free will, but he does not have free choice. The two are distinct concepts. Of course his boss restricts the worker's choice. It's irrelevant whether he has no obligation to offer him higher wages; not offering higher wages is logically equivalent to restricting the possible choices of higher wages. -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfinity0_7a16.html" title="User:Infinity0"><span style="color:red;">infinity</span></a><b><a href="../../../i/n/f/User_talk%7EInfinity0_df0a.html" title="User talk:Infinity0"><span style="color:red;">0</span></a></b> 15:57, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Donnacha, I think I now understand what is the anarcho-communist critic against anarcho-capitalism; I have reduced it as the following: freedom = equality and thus, if there's is an economic hierarchy (=capitalism), there is no equality between workers and boss (even if voluntary because money is coercitive) so there is no freedom and that's against anarchism.</p>
<p>My main conflicts with you are two: freedom as equality and the idea that the economy seems to you reduced to the relation between boss and worker. Anyway, my conflict with any kind of anarchism is that human kind is forced to create some hierarchies to protect its own freedom... --<a href="../../../i/m/a/User%7EImaglang_ddb6.html" title="User:Imaglang">Neigel von Teighen</a> 20:06, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not just money itself, but the relations it creates. A person with more money has power over a person with less money, and has more coercive potential to force his will over the other's, whether by subtle or aggressive means. Eg. forcing a smaller company out of business by taking all its clients. After this, the smaller company goes bankrupt and is stripped of its freedom to run. -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfinity0_7a16.html" title="User:Infinity0"><span style="color:red;">infinity</span></a><b><a href="../../../i/n/f/User_talk%7EInfinity0_df0a.html" title="User talk:Infinity0"><span style="color:red;">0</span></a></b> 21:25, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

If you can't become more efficient then you should shut down or produce something else. There is no such right to keep customers if you charge them high prices. You don't want others to be able to take your customers by outcometing you. You want them to pay unnecessarily high prices, and I bet you would use the state to prohibit competition.

<p>"Hierarchy" is the "government of the superior (archaic: those with power from divinity, as priests and kings)" this is, somebody considered superior ruling over somebody considered inferior; that's clear to me. Obviously, hierarchies can lead to corruption if they don't have external and internal regulation systems. In what I disagree with you is that economy is not <i>per se</i> a hierarchy; when you sell your house, the one who wants to buy it and has the money will buy it; but first the client must <i>want</i> to buy it. Anarcho-cap, from what I see, claims that this movement of goods can make a state work without the existence of a political hierarchy. And here comes the old linguistic problem of partial or total negation (and that I forgot to use in my anarchy definitions): 'an-' can be used for privation rather than for a complete negation (partial negation), i.e. the lack of something but not just the total opposite of it. Anarcho-capitalism could use a partial negation (lack of a economic hierarchy) and anarcho-communism a total negation (against hierarchy). I will try to illustrate this soon (if you want) with some examples, but I must compile them first! --<a href="../../../i/m/a/User%7EImaglang_ddb6.html" title="User:Imaglang">Neigel von Teighen</a> 00:22, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Want to rename this to "Anarchism and individualist anarchism" or "Social anarchism and Individualist anarchism"? It's too weird as it is now, because a lot of the objections from other "anarchists" don't just apply to anarcho-capitalism but to individualist anarchism as a whole. It makes for a really awkard article. It singles out anarcho-capitalism as if it's the only one that supports private property, the only one that allows employment and wages, the only one that allows private defense, etc. Even anarcho-capitalist David Friedman, who is one of the two most famous anarcho-capitalists, says he prefers a system without wage labor, so criticisms from social anarchists don't really make sense. Opinions vary from individualist to individualist in regard to the system they prefer. If there is an article comparing anarchisms I would think it would be between the two major branches, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Individualist_anarchism.html" title="Individualist anarchism">individualist anarchism</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_anarchism.html" title="Social anarchism">social anarchism</a>.

<dd>However, the divide is <i>not</i> between social anarchists and individualists, and that is clear. We already have plenty of material in the other articles differentiating social and individual forms. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 17:26, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't know what you mean by that. The two most broad categories of anarchism are individual anarchism and social anarchism. As far as disputes between two schools, that's the most significant and has been going on throughout the history of anarchism in no matter what form individualist anarchism has taken. Disputes over whether anarcho-capitalism is anarchism is very minor. There's few references to it in sources. That dispute pretty much only take place on the internet among non-notable people, like us Wikipedia editors. It's well established the anarcho-capitalism is anarchism by a multitude of source. But then apparenly, the focus of this article is not supposed to be about such a dispute but about "anarchism and anarcho-capitalism" and "the similarities and differences between anarcho-capitalism and other types of anarchism." An article discussing that between social and individualist anarchism would be much more informative. I guess if no one wants to rename this one, then I could start one. Then, this one could be deleted with some content moved over to that broader article.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 18:05, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I'll give you points for pursuing an agenda with boldness. But it is not, in fact, true that there are few references to the conflict "in sources." There is a rather overwhelming mass of primary sources that couldn't simply be swept away by a paucity of secondary sources. As it stands, there are plenty of references to the conflict in the secondary sources as well. Within actual anarchist circles, there are few conflicts of any greater <i>heat</i>, if not always <i>sense</i>. We do our part to prove that every day. As for "non-notable" people, there are no shortage of published authors (including yours truly) who have weighed in on various sides of the debates. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 20:39, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You're accusing me of POV pushing. I'm not pursuing any agenda in Wikipedia articles. If I do anything POV, it would be restricted to my userpage. And, no there are not many primary sources that say anarcho-capitalism is not anarchism. Where are they? There is the anarcho-communist Meltzer claiming, in his book, that it's not anarchism because of private defense, but he also claims Tucker isn't an anarchist for the same reason.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 20:47, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Every day, the body of primary-source material on the anarchism vs. an-cap debate gets larger, if not necessarily richer. If you want to argue that the thousands of contributions to the debate are not "notable" or "quotable" on Wikipedia, then you need to make your case. While the Wikipedia standards obviously skew the range of "notable" events toward those that have been <i>already noted</i> in secondary, academic writings, it is an abuse of those standards to simply attempt to erase a major controversy. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 19:00, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Don't you understand that it doesn't matter whether the rabble are arguing over whether anarcho-capitalism is anarchism or not, in regard to whether it actually is? Because you or I argue in a forum, that does not constitute a legitimate source, according to Wikipedia (and according to all common sense). It doesn't matter how many self-styled "anarchists" are arguing over the subject; the debate is irrelevant because the people arguing over it are irrelevant. They're not notable people and their opinions on are not notable.

<dl>
<dd>So you say. Personally, I think NPOV is a nonsensical rule, almost completely unenforceable in any useful way—just one more instance of Wikipedia's perverse subversion of ordinary scholarly practice. But we muddle along as best we can, don't we. Feel free to be offended or not, as it pleases you.

<dd>For me to POV push in an article would be to state that anarcho-capitalism is better than other forms, or that it's the only form of anarchism. I believe those things but I'm not going to say them in an article. My opinion doesn't count for anything as far as the actual articles go. None of our opinions should. To POV push is for the editor to state his value judgement in an article.

<p>Unless we have some sort of study of opinions among scholars, we're stuck with bland language like "some" or "a number of scholars."

<dl>
<dd>The "majority perspective stuff" is not pure opinion. Anti-anarcho-capitalists have long been searching in vain for claims from published scholars that anarcho-capitalism is not a form of anarchism, but hav only been able to come up with 2 or 3 from anarcho-communists. On the other hand, sources from published scholars saying it is a form of anarchism are easily found. There's hundreds of them. A significan sampling of them are provided in this article. To say that "some" implies that it's a minority position that it's a type of anarchism. I don't see any reason to object to the words "several scholars." There are several scholars cited. There are so many cited that I think it can be stated point blank that anarcho-capitalism IS a form of anarchism. However, I'm comprising my allowing it to say "several" or "many." The minute few that say it is not a form of anarchism, naturally, happen to be anarcho-communists. By "wide variety," it's meant that they come from a wide variety of political pursasions, including more objective anarcho-communists.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 22:33, 21 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Sure it is. It is probably the case that <i>most</i> accounts of anarchism do not even address anarcho-capitalism, and this is at least as telling as explicit repudiation. Most anarchist scholars simply don't care enough about market anarchism, let alone the an-cap position, to bother to be "anti-anarcho-capitalists." <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 23:00, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>To not care about or discuss anarcho-capitalism is not the same thing as holding that it's not a form of anarchism. "There are several recognized varieties of anarchism, among them: individualistic anarchisms, anarcho-capitalisms, anarcho-communisms, mutualisms, anarcho-syndicalisms, libertarian socialisms, social anarchisms and now eco-anarchisms. These varieties are not particularly well characterized. They are by no means mutually exclusive. So far even a satisfactory classification is lacking. Usually something of a ragbag is offered. Textbooks single out a few varieties for scrutiny, invariably leaving out others that are as important." <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Sylvan_c074.html" title="Richard Sylvan">Sylvan, Richard</a>.

<dd>You know, I'm not one of the people much concerned with the "true anarchism" debates, but every time you trot these awful <b>tertiary</b> sources out as if they were conclusive, I feel at least a twinge of that old "anti-" feeling. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 23:17, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><i>Yada yada.</i> I didn't say a thing about secondary sources. In this instance, secondary sources an undoubtedly the most useful. There are, however, no secondary sources that make the claims you want to make, as there are no useful surveys of scholarship on the question. That leaves a choice between vague language and OR. The argument that <b>tertiary</b> sources are <i>preferable</i> is another one that I'll be happy to challenge you on. We've already seen, on numerous occasions, how the political encyclopedias and the like simply repeat, without expertise or knowledge of context, the same quasi-facts. Tertiary sources are practically <i>defined</i> by their relative lack of accuracy. In any event, what Sylvan <i>actually says</i> is that while various sorts of anarchism are "recognized," the literature is essentially in its infancy. Academic writers have hardly scratched the surface when it comes to anarchism. In this, of course, Sylvan is absolutely right. Fortunately, that seems to be changing. I had the pleasant experience of sitting in the microforms room at the university here the other day, scanning old freethought papers for anarchist material, while a colleague from another department worked with an assistant on German anarchist papers. Two big anarchist history projects side by side at one university is cause for hope. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 18:28, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yada yada yourself. Tertiary sources are perfectly acceptable as sources on Wikipedia. Anyway, Sylvan is a secondary source - not a tertiary source. You still don't understand Wikipedia. This is the place for merely presenting sourced information with as little of our own interpretation of sources as possible. If you want to play pretend-scholar, Wikipedia is definitely not the place. It doesn't matter if your or I think a source is wrong or right. That's not our call to make.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 19:35, 22 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'll repeat my position here: if you can substantiate that concern with accuracy is "disruptive" editing, then perhaps I'll stop concerning myself with it, or Wikipedia. Lacking that substantiation, it will continue to matter that <i>the best sources</i> show another source to be right or wrong. Oh, and <i>sticks and stones</i>... How silly. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 01:32, 23 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Concern with accuracy is fine, as long as you don't push your POV. That is, as long as you don't keep a sources out of an article because you disagree with them or delete information based on those sources. If you think the sources that say anarcho-capitalism is a type of anarchism are wrong, that's not a legitimate basis for deleting the sources or deleting information supported by those sources. You might disagree with what the sources say but the fact remains that the sources say what they say.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 02:27, 23 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, as I have never made any attempt to remove anarcho-capitalism from these articles, and am on record as saying that, at least in the U.S., it needs to be accounted for within the context of the anarchist tradition, you seem to be battling some problem that doesn't exist, eh? It is equally POV to claim that inadequate sources are somehow definitive on questions they are simply not set up to answer. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 17:13, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>By the way, what Sylvan says, and why I provided that quote, is that just because a writer leaves out anarcho-capitalism in a discussion of anarchism it doesn't mean it's not a recognized form of anarchism or that it's not as important as the other types. That was in response to your claim that some authors writing about anarchism leave out anarcho-capitalism.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 19:42, 22 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>And a very strange response it is, as I don't believe it responds to any point that I have <i>actually made</i>. You have made the claim that <i>of people who acknowledge anarcho-capitalism in studies of the field of anarchism, "a wide variety" consider that it must at least be considered among the forms of anarchism</i>, which is not a very surprising or strong claim. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 01:32, 23 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, my claim is simply that "many" scholars from a variety of political persuasions consider anarcho-capitalism to be a type of anarchism. There are many sources listed, and the sources are credible by Wikipedia standards. You have no argument to contradict that.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 02:27, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
