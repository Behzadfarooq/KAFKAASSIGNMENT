<p>Blanche Sitznski was born in <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pittsburgh%2C_Pennsylvania_b3a2.html" title="Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania">Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</a>. She worked as a steelworker until executives at the <a href="../../../r/o/x/Roxxon_Oil_Company_ba15.html" title="Roxxon Oil Company">Roxxon Oil Company</a> selected her to become a special agent in covert operations. She was already well adjusted to villainy, as she was the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calisthenics.html" title="Calisthenics">calisthenics</a> instructor at <a href="../../../t/a/s/Taskmaster_%28comics%29.html" title="Taskmaster (comics)">Taskmaster</a>'s Academy. It was there that she trained several women in hand-to-hand combat, most notably <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diamondback_%28comics%29.html" title="Diamondback (comics)">Diamondback</a> and Snapdragon. She was eventually taken to Roxxon's Mutagenic Laboratory and bioengineered to have various permanent serpentine features. Her entire skeletal structure was laced with an artificial <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adamantium_%28comics%29.html" title="Adamantium (comics)">adamantium</a>, giving her the ability to elongate her arms and legs, which she uses to constrict her enemies. She has also been surgically given gills, which allows her to breathe underwater.</p>

<p>Her first mission grouped her with three other snake-themed villains: <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sidewinder_%28comics%29.html" title="Sidewinder (comics)">Sidewinder</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Mamba_%28comics%29_5d56.html" title="Black Mamba (comics)">Black Mamba</a>, and <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_Adder_%28comics%29_d387.html" title="Death Adder (comics)">Death Adder</a>. They were given the task to retrieve the <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serpent_Crown_0396.html" title="Serpent Crown">Serpent Crown</a> for the Roxxon company president, Hugh Jones. During the mission, the group came into conflict with the <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantastic_Four_3810.html" title="Fantastic Four">Fantastic Four</a>'s <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thing_%28comics%29.html" title="Thing (comics)">Thing</a> and the <a href="../../../i/n/h/Inhumans.html" title="Inhumans">Inhuman</a> <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triton_%28comics%29.html" title="Triton (comics)">Triton</a>. Anaconda jumped at the opportunity to battle the Thing, and was able to apprehend him with ease. They found the Serpent Crown, but the Thing and Triton retaliated, defeating Anaconda, Black Mamba, and Death Adder and allowing Sidewinder to escape.</p>
<p>Anaconda broke her teammates out of prison using her brute strength, and they were sent on another mission -- this time, to search for a powerful weapon known as the microscanner. After battling <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron_Man_58f4.html" title="Iron Man">Iron Man</a>, Anaconda and the others were defeated and presumably taken back to prison. Upon learning this, Sidewinder broke them out and invited them to join his new criminal organization, the <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serpent_Society_f66d.html" title="Serpent Society">Serpent Society</a>. Anaconda eagerly accepted the offer in hopes of earning a healthy sum of money. At the orientation, Sidewinder grouped Anaconda together with <a href="../../../c/o/b/Cobra_%28comics%29.html" title="Cobra (comics)">Cobra</a> and the <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rattler_%28comics%29.html" title="Rattler (comics)">Rattler</a> to perform an initiation test. Their job was to steal equipment from the bankrupt Brand Corporation. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constrictor_%28comics%29.html" title="Constrictor (comics)">Constrictor</a>, annoyed with the whole idea of the Serpent Society, spied on Anaconda's group and called the <a href="../../../a/v/e/Avengers_%28comics%29.html" title="Avengers (comics)">Avengers</a> hotline to tip them off. <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_America_1fa3.html" title="Captain America">Captain America</a> showed up just as Anaconda and the others were pulling their heist, and Anaconda ordered Cobra and Rattler to return to Sidewinder with the apparatus. After a fierce battle with the former Avenger, Anaconda was able to wrap her arms around Captain America. She started to crush his bones, but one well-placed hit of his shield knocked her out, and she was taken to jail.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Captain America #310.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Teleported out by Sidewinder, Anaconda paid a visit to Constrictor, thoroughly thrashing him and leaving him for dead. Anaconda also participated in the mission to murder <a href="../../../m/2E/o/M.O.D.O.K._8302.html" title="M.O.D.O.K.">M.O.D.O.K.</a>, but was knocked out with a mind-blast early on in the fight. However, her teammates <a href="../../../c/o/t/Cottonmouth_%28comics%29.html" title="Cottonmouth (comics)">Cottonmouth</a> and Death Adder were able to slaughter him, and Anaconda carried his corpse to <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advanced_Idea_Mechanics_3bfb.html" title="Advanced Idea Mechanics">A.I.M.</a> for the large sum profit they were promised. Soon after, Anaconda's best friend, Death Adder, was murdered by the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scourge_of_the_Underworld_896e.html" title="Scourge of the Underworld">Scourge of the Underworld</a>.</p>
<p>When <a href="../../../v/i/p/Viper_%28comics%29.html" title="Viper (comics)">Viper</a> invaded the Serpent Society, Anaconda willingly switched sides and attacked Diamondback when she brought Captain America to help, but was defeated by Diamondback's acid-tipped diamonds. Later, Cobra took over leadership and he an Anaconda had a mutual respect for each other, having worked together on many missions in the past. Anaconda also took time out to help Diamondback's date with Captain America (though she didn't know it at the time) go smoothly. Upon learning that Diamondback knew the true identity of her sworn enemy, Captain America, Anaconda turned on Diamondback and voted guilty during her trial.</p>

<p>Anaconda eventually became romantically involved with one of the new recruits, <a href="../../../p/u/f/Puff_Adder_%28comics%29_811c.html" title="Puff Adder (comics)">Puff Adder</a>. They, along with <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_Python_%28comics%29_9ba8.html" title="Rock Python (comics)">Rock Python</a> were sent to retrieve Diamondback, who had escaped her <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_sentence.html" title="Death sentence">death sentence</a>. They eventually crashed their Serpent Saucer into Diamondback's apartment, where she, Black Mamba, and <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asp_%28comics%29.html" title="Asp (comics)">Asp</a> were hiding out. The girls were easily taken out by Anaconda and her boys, but their kidnapping attempt was interrupted by an invitation to join <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superia.html" title="Superia">Superia</a>'s all-female villain group, the <a href="../../../f/e/m/Femizons.html" title="Femizons">Femizons</a>. Diamondback, Black Mamba, and Asp accepted, and reluctantly, Anaconda followed suit. While on Superia's ship, Anaconda caused quite a ruckus with the villainess <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quicksand_%28comics%29.html" title="Quicksand (comics)">Quicksand</a>. She also took part in the attack on Captain America and <a href="../../../p/a/l/Paladin_%28comics%29.html" title="Paladin (comics)">Paladin</a>, but fled when the Femizons disbanded. She reappeared with the Serpent Society when super hero undercover, <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Flag_43c1.html" title="Jack Flag">Jack Flag</a>, attempted to join the group to replace a retired Cobra. Anaconda battled Jack Flag and his partner Free Spirit until <a href="../../../f/o/r/Force_Works_6a15.html" title="Force Works">Force Works</a> showed up and put an end to the battle.</p>
<p>Much later, Anaconda took part in the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloodsport.html" title="Bloodsport">Bloodsport</a> tournament in hopes of winning the prize money. She easily took out her first opponent, <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forearm_%28Comics%29_1c40.html" title="Forearm (Comics)">Forearm</a>, but got her neck slit by her second opponent, <a href="../../../p/u/m/Puma_%28comics%29.html" title="Puma (comics)">Puma</a>. Her ability to heal quickly proved useful, as she survived the attack and returned to the Serpent Society for their mission to exact revenge on Diamondback once again. She then joined <a href="../../../s/2E/h/S.H.I.E.L.D._6d56.html" title="S.H.I.E.L.D.">S.H.I.E.L.D.'s</a> new espionage team, the <a href="../../../s/i/x/Six_Pack_%28comics%29_bda2.html" title="Six Pack (comics)">Six Pack</a>. She eventually turned on them, along with Constrictor, <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solo_%28comics%29.html" title="Solo (comics)">Solo</a>, and <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domino_%28comics%29.html" title="Domino (comics)">Domino</a>, to join forces with <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cable_%28comics%29.html" title="Cable (comics)">Cable</a>, who was trying to create a <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanctuary.html" title="Sanctuary">sanctuary</a> with his newfound powers. She was also warped into Cable's mind, where she saved Cable's life by grabbing onto him before he could get sucked into a <a href="../../../t/e/c/Techno-organic_virus.html" title="Techno-organic virus">techno-organic virus</a>. She continued to work with the Six Pack as they committed acts of terrorism to diminish Cable's reputation.</p>

<p>Anaconda has the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superhuman.html" title="Superhuman">superhuman</a> ability to elongate her limbs and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constrict.html" title="Constrict">constrict</a> her opponents. Her entire skeletal structure is laced with an <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adamantium_%28comics%29.html" title="Adamantium (comics)">adamantium</a> alloy-based substance, increasing her durability. Her arms and legs are able to elongate to about one and a half times their normal length (though most artists show her greatly exceeding that length), while her muscles engorge with blood, giving the appearance of massive, snake-like limbs. Once she has entwined her limbs around a human-sized foe, there are very few human beings able to break free of her grip. She has also been surgically given gills, which allows her to breathe underwater. Due to all the bio-engineering performed on her, Anaconda has incredible recuperative abilities and she is able to heal non-fatal wounds several times faster than a normal human being.</p>
