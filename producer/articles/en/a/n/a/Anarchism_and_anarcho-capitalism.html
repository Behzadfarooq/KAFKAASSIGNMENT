<p>Like the nineteenth century individualists, believed that security should be provided by multiple competing businesses rather than by a tax-funded central agency.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[3]</a></sup> However, he rejected their <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labor_theory_of_value.html" title="Labor theory of value">labor theory of value</a> in favor of the modern neo-classical <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marginalism.html" title="Marginalism">marginalist</a> view. Thus, like most modern economists, he did not believe that prices in a free market would, or should be, proportional to labor (nor that "usury" or "exploitation" necessarily occurs where they are disproportionate). Instead, he believed that different prices of goods and services in a market, whether completely free or not, are ultimately the result of goods and services having different <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marginal_utilities.html" title="Marginal utilities">marginal utilities</a> rather than the fact they contain differing amounts of labor - and that there is nothing unjust about this. Rothbard also disagreed with Tucker that interest would disappear with unregulated banking and money issuance. Rothbard believed that people in general do not wish to lend their money to others without compensation, so there is no reason why this would change where banking is unregulated. Nor, did he agree that unregulated banking would increase the supply of money because he believed the supply of money in a truly free market is self-regulating. And, he believed that it is good that it would not increase the supply or inflation would result.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[4]</a></sup> Few individualist anarchists still agree with the labor theory of value of the nineteenth century individualists or their theories on money, and as a result, according to mutualist <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Carson_3c69.html" title="Kevin Carson">Kevin Carson</a>, "most people who call themselves 'individualist anarchists' today are followers of Murray Rothbard's Austrian economics."<sup id="_ref-carson_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-carson" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>Many anarchists argue that capitalism runs contrary to an egalitarian power structure, which is necessary to anarchism. They also argue that the system of <a href="../../../w/a/g/Wage_labour.html" title="Wage labour">wage labour</a>, and hence capitalism, is authoritarian and coercive in nature, and oppose class distinction between labourers and employers.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[10]</a></sup> A major line of reasoning is that employees are subject to the authority of their employer with respect to the latter's property and, because such an hierarchy could not be tolerated within an egalitarian power structure, it is essential to anarchism for such practices to be abolished. The writers of <a href="../../../a/n/_/An_Anarchist_FAQ_95c9.html" title="An Anarchist FAQ">An Anarchist FAQ</a><sup id="_ref-anarchistFAQ_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-anarchistFAQ" title="">[11]</a></sup> argue that "social relations between capitalists and employees can never be equal, because private ownership of the means of production gives rise to social hierarchy and relations of coercive authority and subordination".<sup id="_ref-anarchist-coercive_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-anarchist-coercive" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="../../../i/n/d/Individualist_anarchism.html" title="Individualist anarchism">Individualist anarchists</a>, of which anarcho-capitalists are included, do not object to private ownership of the means of production. Even the <i>anti-capitalist</i> individualist anarchists of the nineteenth century did not reject employment as illegitimate "hierarchy." For example, the nineteenth century individualist anarchist <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Pearl_Andrews_10f6.html" title="Stephen Pearl Andrews">Stephen Pearl Andrews</a> said, "The 'Wages System' is essentially proper and right. It is a right to that one man employ another, it is right that he pay him wages, and it is right that he direct him absolutely, arbitrarily, if you will, in the performance of his labor...It is not in any, nor in all of these features combined, that the wrong of our present system is to be sought and found. It is in the simply failure to do Equity. It is not that men are employed and paid, but that they are not paid justly..."<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[13]</a></sup> Any that had opposition to employment by others, opposed it for monetary reasons rather than condeming it as "hierarchical." For example, Spooner argued that "each man should be his own employer, or work directly for himself, and not for another for wages; because, in the latter case, a part of the fruits of his labor go to his employer, instead of coming to himself." They did not object to wages being paid, but rather they believed that wages were not adquately compensating labor due to state interference in the economy. <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Tucker_454b.html" title="Benjamin Tucker">Benjamin Tucker</a> thought that the elimination of state intervention would increase competition in capital, which he thought would eliminate the possibility of an employer receiving an income without himself laboring so that "every man will be a labourer exchanging with fellow-labourers."<sup id="_ref-tucker-pay_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tucker-pay" title="">[14]</a></sup> With that said, anarcho-capitalist <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_D._Friedman_0dd4.html" title="David D.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_and_anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Edit section: Property">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Property</span></h3>
<p>Many anarchists argue that anarcho-capitalism is contradictory, and say that the anarcho-capitalist definition of private property is uncomfortably similar to its definition of the state. For example, leading anarcho-capitalist Murray Rothbard argued that the state <i>"arrogates to itself a monopoly of force… over a given area territorial area."</i>, yet he also argued that <i>"[o]bviously, in a free society, Smith has the ultimate decision-making power over his own just property, Jones over his, etc."</i><sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>Anarcho-capitalists acknowledge this similarity, but do not believe it to be contradictory, arguing that state territories are not acquired legitimately, but that private property is. Opponents emphasize that both the state, and private property (upon which capitalism is based), lead to the same authoritarian structures, and consequently neither should be considered anarchist. Moreover, both social and individualist anarchists note that current distributions of property have not been created by legitimate means and that the current system of property rights is the result of state and capitalist intervention.<sup id="_ref-anarchist-coercive_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-anarchist-coercive" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>To anarcho-capitalists, any geographical holding as large as most current incarnations of the state would be impossible to achieve by any one proprietor without the tools of the state. Standard private holdings tend to be not only much smaller, but antithetical to coercive relationships - as any visitor, lessee, or employee, would be free to move elsewhere at will. Further, the state, being an artificial entity without a head of its own, has an entirely different set of motives regarding care of a property, resulting in proportionate carelessness for that property (i.e. <a href="../../../p/o/l/Pollution.html" title="Pollution">pollution</a>).</p>
<p>Anarchists also note that once land and capital are monopolised by a minority, attempts by those subject to this economic and social power to end it automatically become "aggression." As Kropotkin noted, <i>"modern Individualism… [is] a powerful indictment against the dangers and wrongs of government, but its practical solution of the social problem… lead[s] us to inquire if the talk of 'No force' be merely an excuse for supporting landlord and capitalist domination."</i><sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>Individualist anarchists, including Benjamin Tucker, tend to reject the anarcho-capitalist <a href="../../../l/o/c/Lockean.html" title="Lockean">Lockean</a> position in favour of the anarchist position of <i>"occupancy and use"</i> (or "possession", to use <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proudhon.html" title="Proudhon">Proudhon</a>'s term), particularly in land. One notable exception is Lysander Spooner, who does not require that land use be "continual" to retain ownership.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[18]</a></sup> Similarly, anarcho-capitalist Rothbard argued that one must "<i>use the land, to</i> cultivate <i>it in some way, before he could be asserted to own it.</i>" and did not require continual use to retain ownership. However, most individualist anarchists accepted Proudhon's position on land: <i>"What I cannot accept, regarding land, is that the work put in gives a right to ownership of what has been worked on."</i> If there was a shortage of land, he <i>"accept[ed] equal division. Anything else… is an abuse."</i><sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[19]</a></sup> Anarchists critics of "anarcho-capitalism" also note that Proudhon's <i>"<a href="../../../w/h/a/What_is_Property__14d1.html" title="What is Property?">What is Property?</a>"</i> explicitly refutes the position on land ownership supported by Spooner and anarcho-capitalists.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>Because of his belief in the labor theory of value, when the nineteenth century individualist Benjamin Tucker said that an employee should receive his "full produce," he took it to mean that the full produce was an amount of money fully commensurate with the amount of a labor performed. He believed individuals were receiving less than their "full produce" because of state intervention interfering with competitive market forces and thereby artifically lowering the price of labor. He did not advocate interfering with individuals contracting as employee and employer if they desire, but believed that the price of labor would increase in a true laissez-faire economy. He thought that legal restrictions on banking caused the price of capital to be unnaturally expensive and that if these restrictions were removed that capital would become available "at cost." This, he believed, would cause new businesses to proliferate and raise the demand for labor and therefore the price as well. Individualist Lysander Spooner advocated that workers maximize their incomes through universal self-employment.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_and_anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Edit section: Markets">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Markets</span></h3>
<p>Many individualist anarchists argue that a truly free market would result in a non-capitalist anarchism, without social or economic hierarchy. The contemporary individualist <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_A._Carson_0d19.html" title="Kevin A. Carson">Kevin A. Carson</a> holds that capitalism is founded on "an act of robbery as massive as feudalism," and argues that capitalism could not exist in the absence of a state. Carson argues that if a truly free market were to have been put in effect it would have resulted in a system where the ability to extract a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Profit.html" title="Profit">profit</a> from labor and capital would be negligible as <i>"a system of power in which ownership and control are divorced from labor — could not survive in a free market."</i>.<sup id="_ref-carson-ironfist_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-carson-ironfist" title="">[21]</a></sup> Anarcho-capitalists disagree, with most stating that this economic system would be marked by hierarchy<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>, inequality<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>as well as interest, rent and profit.</p>
<p>Right-libertarians, Carson argues, <i>"take existing property relations and class power as a given."</i> Carson, like previous individualist anarchists, thinks that the <i>"modern worker, like the slave or the serf, is the victim of ongoing robbery; he works in an enterprise built from past stolen labor"</i> and so they are <i>"justified in taking direct control of production, and keeping the entire product of his [or her] labor.</i>"<sup id="_ref-carson-ironfist_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-carson-ironfist" title="">[21]</a></sup> Anarcho-capitalists would consider such expropriation as coercion.</p>
<p>Since anarchists by definition favour voluntary interaction, anarcho-capitalists have argued from a different definition of "voluntary" than has been historically used by anarchists. This has lead to disputes over whether anarcho-capitalists support a genuinely "free market." Anarcho-capitalists (and capitalists in general) understand a trade to be voluntary if there is no physical coercion or threat. Opponents take into account other forms of coercion, such as economic coercion, arguing that an environment of property domination coerces individuals into accepting trades that are not optimal to them because their choices are being actively restricted by others. Anarcho-capitalists demonstrate that such restrictions tend not to be intrusive, but rather maintenance of order between visitors.</p>
<p>Anarchists reject institutions such as interest, rent, and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Profit.html" title="Profit">profit</a> as being intrusive and exploitative, and thus they believe that they should be abolished. They maintain that such institutions were made possible, in part, by state restrictions on banking and currency issuance as well as titles to land, and by vast accumulations of wealth which arise in capitalism and interfere with the free economy. <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalist.html" title="Anarcho-capitalist">Anarcho-capitalists</a> do not believe that interest, rent, or <a href="../../../p/r/o/Profit.html" title="Profit">profit</a> are exploitative, arguing they are compatible with free markets, and claiming these institutions would prevail without government interference.

Rothbard defines "anarchism as a system which provides no legal sanction for such aggression ['against person and property']" and said that "what anarchism proposes to do, then, is to abolish the State, i.e. to abolish the regularized institution of aggressive coercion."<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[22]</a></sup> However, anarchists are unimpressed by this claim. They simply reply that this is privatising, not abolishing, the state; David Weick, for instance, argues that it would be better called "<i>feudalism</i>". Similarly, anarchists ask who defines what is and is not a "legal sanction" and what is and is not "aggressive coercion."<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>

Some anarchists, like <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proudhon.html" title="Proudhon">Proudhon</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/k/Bakunin.html" title="Bakunin">Bakunin</a> and <a href="../../../t/u/c/Tucker.html" title="Tucker">Tucker</a>, base this in the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_theory_of_value.html" title="Labour theory of value">labour theory of value</a> while others, like <a href="../../../k/r/o/Kropotkin.html" title="Kropotkin">Kropotkin</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malatesta.html" title="Malatesta">Malatesta</a>, did not. While classical economists such as <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Smith_aff1.html" title="Adam Smith">Adam Smith</a> also accepted the labor theory of value, most modern economists, including anarcho-capitalists, espouse a <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subjective_theory_of_value.html" title="Subjective theory of value">subjective theory of value</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marginalism.html" title="Marginalism">marginalism</a> - that value of commodities and labor is variable and based on factors outside the means of production, such as scarcity, and the subjective value to potential buyers.</p>
<p>In the eyes of traditional anarchism, profit is derived by paying labor less than what it is worth, with the employer retaining the difference, and is considered exploitative. For anarcho-capitalists, worth is subjective. And they believe that both employer and employee profit by giving what they value less (equipment and labor, respectively) for what they value more (labour and wages, respectively) or else they would not agree to trade, and therefore the agreement is not considered exploitative by anarcho-capitalists.</p>
<p>The nineteenth century individualists depart from <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalist.html" title="Anarcho-capitalist">anarcho-capitalists</a> in arguing that all wages should be equal insofar as labor is commensurate, in accordance with the principle of "<a href="../../../c/o/s/Cost_the_limit_of_price.html" title="Cost the limit of price">cost the limit of price</a>." <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalist.html" title="Anarcho-capitalist">Anarcho-capitalists</a>, believing that the value of any particular labor is subjective, and should be ultimately decided by mutual agreement, have no opposition whatsoever to employers profiting from the labor of their employees.

<p>Anarcho-capitalism is seen as a form of individualist anarchism by several scholars.<sup id="_ref-Tormey_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tormey" title="">[24]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Perlin_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Perlin" title="">[25]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Raico_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Raico" title="">[26]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Heider_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Heider" title="">[27]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Outhwaite_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Outhwaite" title="">[28]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Bottomore_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bottomore" title="">[29]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Ostergaard_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ostergaard" title="">[30]</a></sup> All of the classical individualist anarchists opposed profit-making and, hence, capitalism as it is commonly defined today.

For example, contemporary individualist anarchist Daniel Burton, who believes that most modern day individualist anarchists are class war anti-capitalists, nonetheless says that <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalism</a> is a type of individualist anarchism <a href="http://www.spaz.org/~dan/individualist-anarchist/ac-vs-ia.html" class="external text" title="http://www.spaz.org/~dan/individualist-anarchist/ac-vs-ia.html" rel="nofollow"><i>Individualist anarchism vs. Anarcho-capitalism</i></a>.

Historian Ralph Raico regards it as "a form of individualist anarchism" (<a href="http://www.mises.org/story/1787" class="external text" title="http://www.mises.org/story/1787" rel="nofollow"><i>Authentic German Liberalism...</i></a>). Simon Tormey, in his book <i>Anti-Capitalism: A Beginner's Guide</i> places no anti-capitalist restriction on being an individualist anarchist: "Pro-capitalist anarchism is, as one might expect, particularly prevalent in the US where it feeds on the strong individualist and libertarian currents that have always been a part of the American political imaginary. To return to the point, however, there are individualist anarchists who are most certainly not anti-capitalist and there are those who may well be."</p>
<p>Some anarcho-capitalists argue that their philosophy is related to <a href="../../../i/n/d/Individualist_anarchism.html" title="Individualist anarchism">individualist anarchism</a>. They believe a major difficulty in resolving the debate is due to the conflicting definitions of the words "<a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a>" and "<a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalism.html" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a>" as used by the two sides. The traditions that object to the term anarcho-capitalism tend to use the term "anarchism" to refer to political movements that are both <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-statist.html" title="Anti-statist">anti-statist</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-capitalist.html" title="Anti-capitalist">anti-capitalist</a>.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Conversely, <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarians.html" title="Libertarians">libertarians</a> and anarcho-capitalists most commonly use the term "anarchism" to refers to any philosophy that opposes all forms of initiatory coercion (without specifications regarding economic systems).<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[32]</a></sup> However, even this is disputed, as many anarchists argue that capitalism is inherently coercive.<sup id="_ref-anarchist-coercive_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-anarchist-coercive" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Lysander Spooner's articles, such as <a href="http://www.lysanderspooner.org/notreason.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.lysanderspooner.org/notreason.htm" rel="nofollow"><i>No Treason</i></a> and the <a href="http://www.lysanderspooner.org/LetterToBayard.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.lysanderspooner.org/LetterToBayard.htm" rel="nofollow"><i>Letter to Thomas Bayard</i></a>, were widely reprinted in early anarcho-capitalist journals, and his ideas — especially his individualist critique of the state and his defense of the right to ignore or withdraw from it — were often cited by anarcho-capitalists. Spooner was staunchly opposed to government interference in economic matters, and supported a "right to acquire property [...] as one of the natural, inherent, inalienable rights of men [...] one which government has no power to infringe [...]".<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[33]</a></sup> Like all anarchists, he opposed government regulation: "All legislative restraints upon the rate of interest are arbitrary and tyrannical restraints upon a man's natural capacity amid natural right to hire capital, upon which to bestow his labor."<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[34]</a></sup> He was particularly vocal, however, in opposing any collusion between banks and government, and argued that the monopolistic privileges that the government granted to a few bankers were the source of many social and economic ills.</p>
<p>Benjamin Tucker supported private ownership of the product of labor, which he believed entailed a rejection of both collective and capitalist ownership. He was a staunch advocate of the <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutualist.html" title="Mutualist">mutualist</a> form of recompensing labor, which holds to "<a href="../../../c/o/s/Cost_the_limit_of_price.html" title="Cost the limit of price">Cost the limit of price</a>". He also advocated a free <a href="../../../m/a/r/Market_economy.html" title="Market economy">market economy</a>, which he believed was prohibited by capitalist monopoly of credit and land backed by the state. He believed that anyone who wishes should be allowed to engage in the banking business and issue their private currency without needing special permission from government, and that unused land should not be restricted to those who wished to use it. He believed that if these and other coercive actions were eliminated that profit in economic transactions would be rendered nearly impossible because of increased availability of capital to all individuals and resulting increased competition in business. Accepting the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labor_theory_of_value.html" title="Labor theory of value">labor theory of value</a> and the resulting "cost principle" as a premise marks one of mutualism's main conflicts with anarcho-capitalism. Although his self-identification as a socialist and sympathy for the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labor_movement.html" title="Labor movement">labor movement</a> led to hostility from some early anarcho-capitalists such as <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_LeFevre_3104.html" title="Robert LeFevre">Robert LeFevre</a>, others, such as Murray Rothbard, embraced his critique of the state and claimed that he defined his "socialism" not in terms of opposition to a free market or private property, but in opposition to government privileges for business. However, individualists argue that capitalism cannot be maintained in the absence of the state. For example, Kevin Carson argues, "As a mutualist anarchist, I believe that expropriation of surplus value — i.e., capitalism — cannot occur without state coercion to maintain the privilege of usurer, landlord, and capitalist. It was for this reason that the free market mutualist Benjamin Tucker — from whom right-libertarians selectively borrow — regarded himself as a libertarian socialist." Tucker characterized the economic demands of Proudhon and Warren by saying, "though opposed to socializing the ownership of capital, they aimed nevertheless to socialize its effects by making its use beneficial to all instead of a means of impoverishing the many to enrich the few [...] Absolute Free Trade; free trade at home, as well as with foreign countries; the logical carrying out of the Manchester doctrine; <i>laissez-faire</i> the universal rule."<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>
<p>Anarcho-capitalism is sometimes viewed by those sympathetic to it as a form of individualist anarchism, despite the fact that the original individualist anarchists universally rejected capitalism (i.e., they opposed profit, which is seen as a fundamental characteristic of capitalism). Organizations such as mutualist.org remain dedicated to "free market anticapitalism," while individualists like Larry Gambone explicitly state that all capitalism is state capitalism. Nonetheless, anarcho-capitalist Wendy McElroy considers herself to be an individualist, while admitting that the original individualists were universally anticapitalist. In addition, historian <a href="http://freeweb.supereva.com/super.freeweb/eurolibertarians/anarcho.htm" class="external text" title="http://freeweb.supereva.com/super.freeweb/eurolibertarians/anarcho.htm" rel="nofollow">Guglielmo Piombini</a> refers anarcho-capitalism as a form of individualist anarchism, though he offers no support for this statement. Collectivist anarchist author Iain McKay and historian Peter Sabatini both argue that anarcho-capitalism is fundamentally opposed to individualist anarchism.</p>
<p>The similarity to anarcho-capitalism in regard to private defense of liberty and property is probably best seen in a quote by 19th-century individualist anarchist <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victor_Yarros_4f89.html" title="Victor Yarros">Victor Yarros</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anarchism means no government, but it does not mean no laws and no coercion. This may seem paradoxical, but the paradox vanishes when the Anarchist definition of government is kept in view. Anarchists oppose government, not because they disbelieve in punishment of crime and resistance to aggression, but because they disbelieve in compulsory protection. Protection and taxation without consent is itself invasion; hence Anarchism favors a system of voluntary taxation and protection.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the claim is controversial, some scholars regard <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalism</a> as being a form of individualism anarchism.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[37]</a></sup> However, other scholars, and many individualist anarchists themselves, do not accept anarcho-capitalism as a form of individualist anarchism, individualist or not, as they assert that <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a> is fundamentally opposed to <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalism.html" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a>.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[38]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[39]</a></sup> As individualist anarchist Joe Peacott says:</p>

Eventually, in the 1950s, <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murray_Rothbard_a505.html" title="Murray Rothbard">Murray Rothbard</a> coined the term "<a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalism</a>" to define his anti-statist, laissez-faire capitalist philosophy.</p>
<p>Rothbard noted that while "strongly tempted," he could not call his ideology "individualist anarchism" because "Spooner and Tucker have in a sense preempted that name for their doctrine and that from that doctrine I have certain differences." Rothbard also supported unregulated banking, as Tucker and other individualists did, but believed that Tucker and Spooner had a flawed understanding of economics to believe that unregulated banking would eliminate profit from interest. Tucker says interest rates are ultimately determined by the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_value_of_money.html" title="Time value of money">time value of money</a>, rather than the supply of money and that interest/profit would still exist in a free banking environment. He says: "it has been particularly distressing to me as an ardent admirer of Spooner and Tucker to find that their followers have emphasized and concentrated on their totally fallacious monetary views almost to the [exclusion of all else and even bring them forth as a panacea for all economic and social ills." <a href="http://www.mises.org/journals/jls/20_1/20_1_2.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mises.org/journals/jls/20_1/20_1_2.pdf" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> Rothbard suggested that individualist anarchists drop the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labor_theory_of_value.html" title="Labor theory of value">labor theory of value</a> which he believed to be erroneous and leading to a false conclusion that profit was exploitative or unnatural in laissez-faire. Rothbard sought to introduce Lockean property rights and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marginalism.html" title="Marginalism">marginalism</a> into individualist anarchism:</p>

<p>Rothbard also rejected Tucker and Spooner's support of a system where there is no written law. He says, "There would be no rational or objective body of law which the juries would in any sense—even morally—be bound to consult, nor even any judicial precedents, since each jury would have the power to decide both the facts and the law of every case strictly ad hoc. With no guides or standards to follow, even juries with the best of will could not be expected to arrive at just or even libertarian decisions." Instead, he argues, "It would not be a very difficult task for Libertarian lawyers and jurists to arrive at a rational and objective code of libertarian legal principles and procedures."<sup id="_ref-Spooner-Tucker_Doctrine_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spooner-Tucker_Doctrine" title="">[2]</a></sup>}}</p>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">Mere common sense would suggest that any court would be influenced by experience; and any free-market court or judge would in the very nature of things have some precedents guiding them in their instructions to a jury. But since no case is exactly the same, a jury would have considerable say about the heinousness of the offence in each case, realising that circumstances alter cases, and prescribing penalty accordingly. This appeared to Spooner and Tucker to be a more flexible and equitable administration of justice possible or feasible, human beings being what they are...</td>

<p>However, this criticism is specific to Rothbard's suggested version of anarcho-capitalism rather than to anarcho-capitalism in general.

<p>Though the modern form of anarcho-capitalism did not exist in Tucker's day, there was a similar philosophy called <a href="../../../v/o/l/Voluntaryism.html" title="Voluntaryism">voluntaryism</a> popularized by <a href="../../../a/u/b/Auberon_Herbert_ce29.html" title="Auberon Herbert">Auberon Herbert</a>. Tucker criticized Herbert's support of profit, but believed that Herbert's anti-statism would nevertheless result in a profitless economy.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[43]</a></sup> Herbert refused to call himself an anarchist, arguing that <i>"we are governmentalists"'. He strongly opposed the idea that initiation of force may somehow become legitimate merely by constituting a majority, reasoning that "If we are self-owners (and it is absurd, it is doing violence to reason, to suppose that we are not), neither an individual, nor a majority, nor a government can have rights of ownership in other men." He did, however, support government</i> "formally constituted by the nation, employing in this matter of force the majority method." <i>Moreover, he argued that the state would remain in his system, for while</i> "the state should compel no services and exact no payments by force," <i>it</i> "should be free to conduct many useful undertakings... in competition with all voluntary agencies... in dependence on voluntary payments."<i><sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[44]</a></sup></i></p>
<p>The 19th century French economist Gustave de Molinari, although he proposed the replacement of the state in a fashion quite similar to anarcho-capitalism, refused to call himself an anarchist, even though France had a significant anarchist movement and had produced the first self-proclaimed anarchist in Proudhon.</p>

<p>Though many scholars say that anarcho-capitalism is a form of anarchism (usually a form of <a href="../../../i/n/d/Individualist_anarchism.html" title="Individualist anarchism">individualist anarchism</a>),<sup id="_ref-anarchism_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-anarchism" title="">[45]</a></sup> most anarchists who are not individualists (most anarchists are <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_anarchists.html" title="Social anarchists">social anarchists</a>) dispute that anarcho-capitalism is a true form of anarchism. Some writers on anarchism point out that anarcho-capitalism and most other forms of anarchism are very different, saying it is <a href="../../../r/i/g/Right_libertarianism.html" title="Right libertarianism">right libertarianism</a> rather than <a href="../../../l/e/f/Left_libertarianism.html" title="Left libertarianism">left libertarianism</a>, but do say that it is still anarchism.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[46]</a></sup> Peter Marshall, avoiding the dictionary definition, simply concludes that "few anarchists would accept 'anarcho-capitalists' into the anarchist camp."<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[47]</a></sup></p>
<p>Many anarchists maintain strongly that <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalism</a> is not a form of <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a> due to their belief that anarchism is necessarily anti-capitalist as well as anti-statist.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[48]</a></sup> They note that, historically, those who called themselves "anarchist" have been opposed to what they called "capitalism," and that anarchists like Proudhon, Bakunin, Kroptkin and Tucker all called themselves socialists, and they argue that anarcho-capitalism <i>"is judged to be anarchism largely because anarcho-capitalists say they are 'anarchists' and because they criticise the State."</i><sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[49]</a></sup> However, virtually all dictionary definitions define "anarchism" as opposition to the state. Furthermore, even most anarchist luminaries who called themselves "socialist" defined "anarchism" as opposition to state.</p>
<p>Both social anarchists and anarcho-capitalists note that "anarchy" etymologically means "without rulers".<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[50]</a></sup> Conventional anarchists interpret this to mean anything fitting the definition of <i>ruler</i>,<sup id="_ref-anarchist-coercive_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-anarchist-coercive" title="">[12]</a></sup> while anarcho-capitalists interpret it in a more restricted sense, to refer to any form of institutionalized <a href="../../../c/o/e/Coercion.html" title="Coercion">coercion</a>.

<p>On the other hand, many scholars view anarcho-capitalism as a 20th-century modification of the type of individualist anarchism that was popular in America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which was less radical than <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Stirner_aa58.html" title="Max Stirner">Stirnerite</a> individualist anarchism. Scholar of political philosophy, Ian Adam, says "it is not in fact the case (as is sometimes thought) that anarcho-capitalism came out of the blue, without past or pedigree. It has a good deal in common with the earlier American tradition of individualist anarchism."<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[51]</a></sup> Anti-capitalist anarchists tend to reject such claims, noting that many of the individualist anarchists called themselves <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialists.html" title="Socialists">socialists</a>, and that all had a vision of a free society at odds with capitalism.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[52]</a></sup> However, the scholars making the assertion that anarcho-capitalism is a more recent form of individualist anarchism are aware that 19th century individualist anarchists were opposed to capitalism (and communism); the assertion is that anarcho-capitalism is a <i>capitalist</i> form of invidualist anarchism. In other words, &lt;space&gt;opposition to stateless capitalism is not a necessary condition of being an individualist forms of anarchism. One anti-capitalist individualist anarchist laments, <i>"is time that anarchists recognise the valuable contributions of... individualist anarchist theory and take advantage of its ideas. It would be both futile and criminal to leave it to the capitalist libertarians…"</i><sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[53]</a></sup></p>
<p>Many anarchists believe that anarchism and capitalism are incompatible. Anarchist author Iain McKay argues that individualism is essentially anti-capitalist and that <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalist.html" title="Anarcho-capitalist">anarcho-capitalists</a> claims to the tradition require reading individualist anarchists out of context (<a href="http://www.infoshop.org/faq/secG1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.infoshop.org/faq/secG1.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>). Individualist anarchist <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Peacott_53d7.html" title="Joe Peacott">Joe Peacott</a> argues that individualism rejects capitalist economic arrangements.<a href="http://www.libertarian.co.uk/lapubs/econn/econn097.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.libertarian.co.uk/lapubs/econn/econn097.htm" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></p>
<p>One set of approaches concludes that capitalism, by necessity, requires a state, and therefore capitalism cannot exist without a state. For example, Larry Gambone states, "for anarchists, capitalism is the result of the development of the state and therefore, all capitalism is in one sense, state capitalism." <a href="http://www.geocities.com/vcmtalk/archive1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/vcmtalk/archive1.htm" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> He adds that when the anarchists use the term "capitalism," they are referring to those who have "gained wealth from the use of governmental power or from privileges granted by government."<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[54]</a></sup> Anarcho-capitalist Wendy McElroy says that when traditional individualist anarchists referred to "capitalism" they meant <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_capitalism.html" title="State capitalism">state capitalism</a>, the alliance of government and business.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[55]</a></sup></p>
<p>The issue of contention then becomes whether or not capitalism can be created, or maintained, in the absence of a state that enforces non-possessive private property claims. Anarcho-capitalist Murray Rothbard made a difference between two contradictory concepts of capitalism, "free-market capitalism" characterized by voluntary exchange and "state capitalism" characterized by violent expropriation.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[56]</a></sup> He believed that only free-market capitalism is true capitalism and as such "the fullest expression of anarchism".<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[57]</a></sup></p>
