<p>I've been tidying up the science fiction magazine entries and plan to rename this article as Astounding (magazine) at some point. I've done this where the word "magazine" wasn't part of the published title. This article already has a bewildering collection of redirects, so what's one more? Please don't create Astounding (magazine) as a redirect, I think that would make it harder to rename this page. <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotinasnaid_e8da.html" title="User:Notinasnaid">Notinasnaid</a> 23:29, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Job done. I have done a little tidying up and removal of double redirects, but this is a can of worms. There is no consistency at all in linking and this is more than I am inclined to attempt. However, here are some ideas, off the top of my head.</p>
<ul>
<li>Individual stories may have appeared in <i><a href="../../../a/s/t/Astounding_%28magazine%29.html" title="Astounding (magazine)">Astounding Stories of Super-Science</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../a/s/t/Astounding_%28magazine%29.html" title="Astounding (magazine)">Astounding Stories</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../a/s/t/Astounding_%28magazine%29.html" title="Astounding (magazine)">Astounding Science-Fiction</a></i>, or <i><a href="../../../a/n/a/Analog_Science_Fiction_2f66.html" title="Analog Science Fiction">Analog Science Fiction-Science Fact</a></i> or perhaps just <i><a href="../../../a/n/a/Analog_Science_Fiction_2f66.html" title="Analog Science Fiction">Analog Science Fiction</a></i> which seems the more popular use. Did it ever change name?. (I redirect to <b>Analog Science Fiction</b> not <b>Astounding (Magazine)</b> because perhaps Analog will have its own entry one day; however, the Astounding name variants probably never will).</li>
<li>Individual authors, artists, editors might have contributed as above, but many will have spanned name changes. In that case I suggest that authors contributed to <i><a href="../../../a/s/t/Astounding_%28magazine%29.html" title="Astounding (magazine)">Astounding magazine</a></i> or <i><a href="../../../a/s/t/Astounding_Analog_%28magazine%29_4245.html" title="Astounding/Analog (magazine)">Astounding/Analog magazine</a></i> (this last will ease the work if there are ever two articles).</li>
<li>The most convenient and unambiguous reference is ASF. But this is, I believe, just fannish jargon and has no place in articles except to define it.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>The primary article title should be Analog (magazine). That is the current title and is what should usefully appear in <a href="../../../s/c/i/Category%7EScience_fiction_magazines_3b41.html" title="Category:Science fiction magazines">Category:Science fiction magazines</a>. I've tried adding the correct category line to the Analog Redirect at <a href="../../../a/n/a/Analog_Science_Fiction_2f66.html" title="Analog Science Fiction">Analog Science Fiction</a>, but it won't show up, therefore, I will rename this article to the title the magazine has carried for the last 45 years within the next week, unless there are objections. -- <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJdowland_630e.html" title="User:Jdowland">Jon Dowland</a> 12:47, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well...just why should Analog, rather than Astounding, appear in the category list? It isn't a category list of <i>current</i> magazines, but rather the ones significant enough to appear in Wikipedia. (Maybe, eventually, all of them.) Personally, I think the Astounding era and name are more important to the history of science fiction than the Analog years. Ideally... why not both? Especially if you are a current reader, perhaps you could create a new article, both would appear in the category list, and the articles could be tightly linked. 62.189.130.33 22:19, 23 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This whole thing is really screwed up. As much as I rever the old Astounding (I began reading it in 1956 and once had a complete collection of the 1940-1959 issues), it's absurd that if someone looks up Analog he's redirected to an article called Astounding. Yes, yes, I <b>know</b> that the Astounding article says that it was later renamed Analog. But that's immaterial. The way it's set up now, it's as if someone does a search for "U.S. News and World Report" and is redirected to an article called "U.S. News", which is what the original magazine was called in the 1930s before it merged with "World Report". What sense would that make? Or if you search for "Newsweek" you end up at an article called "News-Week" or whatever the hell it was called in 1940. Personally, I think that there ought to be an article called <b>Analog</b>, to which anyone searching for <b>Astounding</b> would be referred to. After all, the Analog name has been around for about 45 years now -- it ain't gonna go away.... <a href="../../../h/a/y/User%7EHayford_Peirce_5729.html" title="User:Hayford Peirce">Hayford Peirce</a> 00:39, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>Well, let's see... there are about 100 links to Astounding and 25 links to Analog. Only a handful of these links are of the form [[Astounding|Analog]]. Given that I think changing the article name wouldn't serve the majority of those links well. But I think splitting the article would be a good thing. Why don't we try to evolve a good article here, then the finished product could be sprung on the world? I suggest the article be called <b>Analog Science Fiction and Science Fact</b> if that has been its publication title throughout, <i>or</i> <b>Analog (magazine)</b>. Calling it <b>Analog Science Fiction</b> would serve to perpetuate calling it by the wrong name. I think <b>Analog (magazine)</b> is probably my favourite.</p>
<p>Unless I hear shouts of "no! splitting bad!" I'll try and draft something and add it here (if nobody else does). There's actually very little to rescue from the existing article, which is almost entirely about Astounding... <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotinasnaid_e8da.html" title="User:Notinasnaid">Notinasnaid</a> 08:41, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I second that this article be renamed "Analog Science Fiction and Fact". The first sentence should read something like:
<dl>
<dd><b>Analog Science Fiction and Fact</b> is a science fiction magazine, first published as <b>Astounding Stories</b> in 1930.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>It doesn't matter that Astounding was more notable than Analog, they're both notable, and Analog is still published. It implies in the current first sentence that Analog isn't published anymore, unless you read carefully that it is. I'd almost go so far as to say that calling it Astounding implies a non-neutral POV, as it implies that Astounding is better than Analog. --<a href="../../../d/w/i/User%7EDwiki_de79.html" title="User:Dwiki">Dwiki</a> 06:41, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Whoever wants the title to be Astounding mainly wants it to be that way because of bias (prefers the days of Astounding, or prefers the name, etc.) -- not that it actually affects other articles. From what I know, Analog is a lot more common a title than Astounding.</p>
<p>Someone has stated that Analog generates less links than Astounding; this is because the title was wrongly named Astounding to begin with; and people who wrote articles probably decided to link to Astounding. An easy way to fix this is to rename the article Analog, and have Astounding REDIRECT to Analog, so that the links won't be messed with.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why you should switch to Analog. One is that most people know the magazine as Analog, and not Astounding, and would probably do a search FOR Analog. That is precisely what I did, and was surprised to find an article named Astounding. Analog just recieves more hits. People Wiki and Google for Analog, not Astounding.</p>
<p>Also, at the beginning, I thought that Analog magazine had actually been renamed to Astounding, instead of the other way around. The article title and the "explanation" in the intro actually confused me and led me to believe otherwise. Upon paying closer attention, I found that the rename was actually to Analog. So, to avoid confusion; rename the article.</p>
<p>I should also mention that it's not encyclopedic to name the article Astounding. The unwritten rule (or maybe it is a policy/guideline of Wikipedia) is that the article title must reflect the most recent title of the article's subject; for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>While I haven't read many stories from Astounding or Analog, which means I don't know which contains the "better" (if there is such a thing) science fiction works, that also means that I am unbiased in selecting the correct title. None of that should matter. So -- can someone change the title already, and stop discussing? I would if I knew how. Also, someone should have the first sentence be something like: "...was originally titled Astounding", etc. Besides, I actually think Analog is a cooler name than Astounding (this does not influence my decision of course).</p>
<dl>
<dd>Agree with the above. Further, the magazine has been known as Analog longer than it was known as Astounding. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulLev_4e67.html" title="User:PaulLev">PaulLev</a> 15:30, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If you agree with what I wrote, then I guess you should say so here. Or maybe there, I don't really know....

<dd>Just to reiterate my support for this move. To give an analogy: Having Astounding as the name for Analog article is the equivalent of calling The New York Post article The New York Evening Post (the paper's name until the 1930s).<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulLev_4e67.html" title="User:PaulLev">PaulLev</a> 17:28, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Can we please all reach clear consensus that the article should be moved to "<a href="../../../a/n/a/Analog_Science_Fiction_and_Fact_888e.html" title="Analog Science Fiction and Fact">Analog Science Fiction and Fact</a>" and not "<a href="../../../a/n/a/Analog_Science_Fiction_2f66.html" title="Analog Science Fiction">Analog Science Fiction</a>". The argument was presented that this is more likely to be Wikisearched, but why not just have the article have the exact name of the magazine as currently published. We can easily put a redirect at <a href="../../../a/n/a/Analog_Science_Fiction_2f66.html" title="Analog Science Fiction">Analog Science Fiction</a> so that anyone who searches for it will be redirected to <a href="../../../a/n/a/Analog_Science_Fiction_and_Fact_888e.html" title="Analog Science Fiction and Fact">Analog Science Fiction and Fact</a>, which is (if we can reach consensus and an admin is merciful) where the article will reside. --<a href="../../../d/w/i/User%7EDwiki_de79.html" title="User:Dwiki">Dwiki</a> 18:17, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Now that the Kindly Administrator has straightened out the name of the article and all the redirects seem to work, shouldn't the initial picture at the top of the article now become an Analog cover instead of an Astounding cover?

<p>Thanks for moving the covers around -- it looks good. I have a copy of the most famous of all issues, the "future" issue of November 1949. I'll scan it and do something with it, either here or at the Campbell article, or both. In the meantime, I note that the Nov. '49 issue is called "Astounding Science Fiction", with no hyphen. The article, however, says that the magazine was renamed "Astounding Science-Fiction". Is this worth looking up in order to put in a sentence about the vanishing hyphen? <a href="../../../h/a/y/User%7EHayford_Peirce_5729.html" title="User:Hayford Peirce">Hayford Peirce</a> 01:52, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The 1949 picture looks good. But the "citation needed" in the paragraph puts the whole Analog article in the Unsourced Category (see listing at bottom). If you can't get this citation soon, I think it makes sense to remove the sentence that needs the citation, and then re-enter when the citation is in hand.<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulLev_4e67.html" title="User:PaulLev">PaulLev</a> 20:20, 8 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, you're right. I had already thought about removing that sentence and have just done so. The rest of the info about the November issue doesn't needed a citation, since it's there in the "Requiem" footnote. I've also added some info about when I *think* the minor name change took place. "Requiem" mentions the block letters, and shows them, but doesn't specifically mention the hyphen being removed. It does write SCIENCE FICTION, however, without the hyphen. In any case, the hyphen vanished between 1945 and 1949. <a href="../../../h/a/y/User%7EHayford_Peirce_5729.html" title="User:Hayford Peirce">Hayford Peirce</a> 20:35, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Glad you like it! I just looked at eBay and there's someone selling the November 1949 issue -- to my surprise the starting price is only $3.99 and so far no one at all has bid on it.

Maybe it isn't at all.... <a href="../../../h/a/y/User%7EHayford_Peirce_5729.html" title="User:Hayford Peirce">Hayford Peirce</a> 00:23, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The prices of science fiction magazines in the collector's market are pretty static, and have been for the last 30 years or so: you can find it at a variety of prices in (e.g.) bookfinder.com. Even October 1937 is available at a price that, for age and importance, doesn't seem bad. Only the first couple of years, and especially the first issue, have prices that would frighten a venusian. The main problem with the older issues is that they are crumbling. <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotinasnaid_e8da.html" title="User:Notinasnaid">Notinasnaid</a> 08:08, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>I revised the first paragraph - which Hayford reverted - mainly becaused the original, reverted wording concluded with <i><b>Analog Science Fact &amp; Fiction</b></i>. As someone pointed out in another edit that was reverted to the original - a few weeks ago - the "Science Fact and Fiction" at the end can be jarring, since the current name of the magazine is "Science Fiction and Fact". I therefore think, at the very least, that the first paragraph should conclude with the current name - and an indication (in terms of giving the year) of when that name was adopted. In addition to that, the only other change that I think might be worthwhile is my change of "magazine" to "pulp magazine" near the top. My reasons for the change were it reads better than just repeated "magazine" and it is true.

<li>Well, I found the following very repetitive and needless: "<b>Astounding Science-Fiction</b>, then in 1960 to <b>Analog Science Fact &amp; Fiction</b>, in 1965 to <b>Analog Science Fiction and Science Fact</b>, and in 1991 to its current <b>Analog Science Fiction and Fact</b>". A reader really has to stop and study this to figure out the difference between the last two names. The changes are trifling. And all that info overwhelms the first paragraph -- it could easily go into a later one, along with any other variations that have cropped up over the years, of which there are several. As for <b>pulp magazine</b>, the word <b>pulp</b> is clearly derogatory. Today it isn't used anymore, since the pulps have disappeared. But from the 20s, say, through the 40s, and maybe the 50s, "pulp" meant "low-class junk, fit only for illiterates or imbeciles". The fact that Hammett, Chandler, and Heinlein wrote for the "pulps" was immaterial -- it was still junk. One of the reasons that Campbell wanted to change the name from Astounding was to try to move the mag. out of the pulp category. In fact, at one point he expanded the size of the mag. and used non-pulp paper. If this were an article about, oh, let's make up a name, <b>Thrilling Super-Science Stories</b> of the 1930s, with a tentacled monster grasping a half-naked woman on the cover, then one could, I think, safely use the word "pulp" to describe the mag. To use it for Analog is just plain wrong. <a href="../../../h/a/y/User%7EHayford_Peirce_5729.html" title="User:Hayford Peirce">Hayford Peirce</a> 20:34, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>re: the current revision: I still think the first paragraph should have a phrase that indicates the year in which the current title (Analog Science Fiction and Fact) was adopted; otherwise, what's there now is ok with me.<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulLev_4e67.html" title="User:PaulLev">PaulLev</a> 16:39, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
