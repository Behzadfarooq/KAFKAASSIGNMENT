<p>As a self-identifying anarchist and a person who enjoys wiki because it is an important information resource which is collectively governed (some could argue in an "anarchist" way) I think the most important thing for the Anarchism page would be to have an open introduction which acknowledges the many philosophies and viewpoints associated with the word. Isn't that the backbone of "anarchism" anyway; to respect and value everyone's unique way of being without implying there is one "true" or definite path? I also believe the reference to violence in the frozen intro is unneccessary and should be removed because "Anarchists" in the most general modern meaning of the word are overwhelmingly nonviolent. Not a single introduction for political/social philosophies (that I have found) on wiki reference violence in any way in the intro, this includes the Fascism page intro, which does not even suggest the warlike or violent nature of almost every nation that has identified itself as "fascist." The reference to violence should be removed immediately, or pages such as "fascism," "capitalism," or even "republic," should also include introductory comments on the violent byproducts of those social theorems. The core idea behind "Anarchism" contained in the word itself: -<i>an</i>- (without) -<i>arch</i>- (ruler): <i>without ruler</i>) means that "Anarchy" is implicitly anti-authoritarian, but not neccessarily anti-government. This is because (some may believe, including me) that governments can exist which are not of an authoritarian nature (and therefore Anarchist). The entymology listed on the frozen page is incorrect for many obvious reasons, and I think that the intro needs to return to a state that acknowledges the fundamental root of the word ("without rulers, no rulers, or no authoritarians") awhile appreciating the many interpretations that stem from that well-known foundation. One way or the other, - "vandalism" or not, the page ought to be unfrozen immediately, because it is false and misleading in its current state. Why don't we agree on one open and broad intro which embraces the foundation of the word, and then everyone can apply their many various interpretations from there. It is very important that there is an open consensus on this intro, along with vast theoretical diversity afterword, because that in itself is Anarchism to so many people: we agree we must remove the wrongful rulers first (a correct entymological intro), and then embark on our own individual and unique paths (the many sections after that).</p>
<p>Please join this call to unfreeze the page immediately! The many millions of people who access wiki must also have access to the free and diverse idea exchange which makes up the amazing word: "Anarchism." (REEDBPERRY)</p>
<p>I don't see anything being accomplished by the above discussion. This is all just a continuation of the debates that have taken place between individualists and communists that have been going on for over a hundred years, with both sides denying that the other is true anarchism. I don't see any chance of a resolution. Individualism and collectivism are simply in constant conflict. I could throw in my opinion in the mix but what is that going to solve? Nothing, but inflame communists and create more disputes. So how about unlocking the article so we can edit it? I'm tired of waiting around for a conensus that will never come. <a href="../../../d/t/c/User%7EDTC_5378.html" title="User:DTC">DTC</a> 17:24, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please pay attention: The debate isn't about individualism vs. communism. It's about the definitional issue - what is anarchism. Some want to use the dictionary definition (the definition given by most luminaries); others want to use the circular definition <i>anarchism is whatever has traditionally been considered anarchism.</i> See the section above titled "Neutral Disambiguation Page" for specifics. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 17:44, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There wasn't an edit war. Someone simply decided to lock the article. No one was trying to remove anarcho-captialism out. How could they with all those sources backing it up? Some people were trying to put a "disputed" tag on anarcho-capitalism, but I think it's already been cleared up that anarcho-capitalism is not alone in being disputed. Anarcho-primitivism is also claimed not to be true anarchism, Benjamin Tucker's anarchism claimed not to be true anarchism, anarcho-communism is claimed not to be true anarchism, and so on. THere was no edit warring over the definition of anarchism. <a href="../../../d/t/c/User%7EDTC_5378.html" title="User:DTC">DTC</a> 18:58, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Unprotecting a page because the discussion is leading nowhere is not the way to go. Has anyone thought of asking for arbitration here?

<dd>I suspect that the discussion is going nowhere because no one knows what they're supposed to be discussing. What exactly would be arbitrated? I didn't see any edit warring over taking anarcho-capitalism out of the article, so whether anarcho-capitalism is a form of anarchism shouldn't be a matter of discussion here. I didn't see any edit warring over the definition of anrachism, so why is it being argued over here? What should we be discussing?

<p>It looks to me like there was an edit war over the second paragraph of the intro. The <i>socialist only</i> faction wants to mention only the "self-labeled" anarchists and appeal to socialist tradition; the broad-tent faction wants to mention that there were anarchists of all stripes historically (but usually not self-labeled as such). I.e. the old definitional dispute. When unprotected, I intend to change the intro to something like this:</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Anarchism</b> is the name of a <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_philosophy.html" title="Political philosophy">political philosophy</a> or a group of doctrines and attitudes that are centered on rejection of <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government.html" title="Government">government</a>, or the <a href="../../../s/t/a/State.html" title="State">state</a>, as harmful and unnecessary and support its elimination.<sup id="_ref-definitions_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-definitions" title="">[1]</a></sup>The term "anarchism" is <a href="../../../e/t/y/Etymology.html" title="Etymology">derived from</a> the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_language.html" title="Greek language">Greek</a> <i><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%B1%CF%81%CF%87%CE%AF%CE%B1" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:αναρχία">αναρχία</a></i> ("without <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archon.html" title="Archon">archons</a>" or "without rulers"). Thus "anarchism," in its most general meaning, is the belief that all forms of <a href="../../../r/u/l/Rulership.html" title="Rulership">rulership</a> are undesirable and should be abolished. The rise of anarchism as a philosophical movement began in the late 18th century, with <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmund_Burke_4d22.html" title="Edmund Burke">Edmund Burke</a>'s <a href="http://www.ozarkia.net/bill/anarchism/library/VindicationBurke/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ozarkia.net/bill/anarchism/library/VindicationBurke/index.html" rel="nofollow">Vindication of Natural Society</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Godwin_a3c4.html" title="William Godwin">William Godwin</a>'s <a href="http://socserv2.socsci.mcmaster.ca/~econ/ugcm/3ll3/godwin/pj.html" class="external text" title="http://socserv2.socsci.mcmaster.ca/~econ/ugcm/3ll3/godwin/pj.html" rel="nofollow">Enquiry Concerning Political Justice</a>.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>On its own anarchism does not provide a world view beyond the idea that the state is unnecessary and should be abolished. There are a variety of types of anarchism, generally emphasizing their points of difference.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[3]</a></sup> Economic arrangements are one of the main areas of disagreement. Historically, no one knows whether most anarchists were <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalism.html" title="Capitalism">capitalist</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutualism_%28economic_theory%29.html" title="Mutualism (economic theory)">mutualist</a>, or <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialism.html" title="Socialism">socialist</a>. Assessment is difficult since, historically, pro-capitalist anarchists have generally not used that label due to perceived association with socialism and violence.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[4]</a></sup> Today, most <i>self-described</i> anarchists consider themselves <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-capitalism.html" title="Anti-capitalism">anti-capitalist</a>, except perhaps in the United States.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<dd>Exactly right, and I hope DTC may be beginning to see hogeye's modus as well. incidentily, i don't think any objective person here would agree with the sentence, "Assessment is difficult since, historically, pro-capitalist anarchists have generally not used that label due to perceived association with socialism and violence." that is entirely unsupported conjecture. historically, pro-capitalist anarchists in the US call themselves anarcho-capitalists. if these procap anarchists you speak of have not called themselves anarchists than they are not anarchists of any type. if they existed, then what did they call themselves? Just another example of hogeye's bullshit games and POV that degenerate the quality and fairness of this article. as long as the ancaps and pro-ancap editors continue to side with him on issues they are hurting their image, credibility, and this article. i believe it is fair to assume bad faith when regarding an editor who is consistently banned. <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlockader_5d3e.html" title="User:Blockader">Blockader</a> 20:38, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Still using your weak circular definition, I see. Pro-capitalist anarchists used to call themselves <i>économistes</i> (Molinari), voluntaryists (Auberon Herbert), and various other things. It's hard to see your objection to "Assessment is difficult since, historically, pro-capitalist anarchists have generally not used that label due to perceived association with socialism and violence." What do you object to? That assessment of numbers in each economic school is difficult? That pro-capitalists were reluctant to call themselves anarchists? That the term was often associated with violence or socialism? The first is obvious, and the other two are easily supportable. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 21:51, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If it isn't commonly accepted today that they were such, then what you present is a new synthesis of information, which is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. Original research may be accurate and quite well-done; however, it's not acceptable on Wikipedia, the same way Wikipedia aims not to be <i>true</i> but <i>verifiable</i>. --AaronS 22:09, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Do you always argue in fallacies? Let me show you why your discursive tactics are disruptive, disingenuous, and regressive. Looking at my statement, there were several possible ways of interpreting it: (1) Since I am referring to research and to the content of an encyclopaedia, it can be inferred, rather simply, that I am talking about the generally-accepted ideas of a community whose research is acceptable for publication in an encyclopaedia; namely, academics who have published theories in respected journals, or who have been published by respected publishers. It would seem obvious that I am contrasting this with what Wikipedia considers to be "original research," i.e. anything that does not fall into the above description. (2) You could focus on my use of the phrase "commonly accepted today" and treat it in the least generous way possible; you could, for instance, be too lazy to make the simple inferences noted above, or you might recognize them and ignore them for the benefit of your argument, and attack an interpretation that makes less sense, is less coherent, and is therefore easier to debunk. Given these two options, regardless of the discussion, you always favor the second; you do not give those who disagree with you the benefit of the doubt, and choose instead to attack sloppily propped-up straw men. You are more concerned with winning an argument than with arriving, through the exchange of ideas, at the best conclusion. This is because you already believe that you have <i>the</i> conclusion, and will do everything you can to retroactively confirm it, through similarly careless and dishonest methods. Your goal is to convince others of what you perceive to be the insurmountable veracity of your thesis; error on your part, in terms of your ultimate conclusion, is impossible for you. To you, those who disagree with you are not presenting logical or coherent arguments; and, even if they are not always worded in the best way, you refuse to interpret them generously, thereby multiplying intelligent discourse, and decide, instead, to read them in the worst way possible, or attack the weakest possible interpretation. Since you have already decided the truth of the matter, you see no reason in engaging in discourse; indeed, you use these dishonest methods, because, for you, the ends justify the means. This is why, at every opportunity, you distract all discussion relevant to the improvement of the article. If you can frustrate everybody who disagrees with you into quitting the article, then you are content. Battles can be won with dishonest tactics, with straw men, red herrings, and simple trolling. The methods, however, are still dishonest, and this is why many people find discussion with you to be pointless. <i>We</i> are not trying to "win" a battle; <i>you</i> are. We are trying to engage in a discussion, and if everybody learns something at the end -- even if it means learning that one is wrong -- then all the better. You are not interested in such an intellectual pursuit. You are an idealogue, a zealot, a charlatan, and nothing more.</dd>
<dd>These comments are probably uncivil. If civility is courteousness, however, then I owe none to you. Courtesy is due to those worthy of respect. Your behavior is not. And I stress that my problem with you is not with you, but with your behavior; I call you a charlatan, because you pose as someone who is interested in philosophy, but act like a sophist. If you were to change your behavior, I would change my perception of you. I am not, however, optimistic. --AaronS 01:25, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wow! I guess my whale analogy struck a nerve. Probably because I stuck to the dictionary/luminary definition of "anarchism," and you would prefer that I use your circular traditionalist definition. Of <i>course</i> you don't accept my whale analogy because that assumes "my" definition. Just as I don't accept your longwinded <i>generally-accepted ideas of a community</i> spiel, since that assumes "your" definition. The rest of your message, the uncivil part, is classic transference.

<p>This is not a debate between individualists and socialists. No one has denied that the individualist anarchists were anarchists (although, personally, I think they were inconsistent ones). That is because they considered themselves as socialists and/or aimed to abolished capitalist exploitation. The question is whether "anarcho"-capitalists should be able to rewrite the history of anarchism or not. As a compromise, they should be listed as a school of anarchism, but only if it is clearly and obviously noted that few anarchists would accept them as anarchists. That second point is, I think, an obvious fact. Moreover, I would like it noted that their fore-runners like Molinari refused the term anarchism because of its socialist nature. That is a significant point and indicates well that "anarcho"-capitalism really is a different political tradition to anarchism. Given this, any introduction should note that few, if any, anarchists consider anarchism to be "pure anti-statism." Reading Proudhon, Kropotkin, Bakunin, Goldman and so on they were obviously anti-capitalist as well. Their general introductions make that perfectly clear. Tucker was also critical of capitalism and its property rights and called himself a socialist. Labadie (father and son) called anarchism a form of socialism. As such, when Kropotkin called anarchism the "no government form of socialism" no anarchist would disagree. To ignore this is, simply, to ignore the history of anarchism and what it stands for. Just because Rothbard decided to call his ideology "anarchism" does not make it so. [BlackFlag], 09:05, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>(edit conflict)Anarchism is not an academic issue, it's a living breathing tradition. When you want information about a tradition, you look within, not without, it. Emma Goldman's piece makes clear that, in 1910, one of the most famous and influential anarchists ever regarded anarchism as one multi-faceted tradition. Of course there were disagreements - Tucker was a grumpy old sod, Emma was probably jealous of Voltairine De Cleyre, Kropotkin became detached from the real world around him later in life and was arguably too influenced by the little needed to improve the lives of Russian serfs, Proudhon and Bakunin were bigots, Bookchin and Hakim Bey spend too much time arguing with each other while most most anarchists have taken elements from the philosophy of both. That's where the tradition is, anarchism is not dogmatic, there are no primary texts. Anarchists within the tradition pick and choose elements, add bits, take bits out and synthesis their own version (often arguing amongst themselves). However, it is and always has been a multi-faceted socialist tradition. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonnachadelong_ddd0.html" title="User:Donnachadelong">Donnacha</a> 12:24, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So instead of a capitalist conspiracy, this has become an academic conspiracy? I have a an academic source from 1889 that already says that communist anarchism should be dealt with by the courts, and is not really worth ink about, namely: "...the Communist Anarchists are revolutionists of the most violent sort. They form the extreme left wing of the modern revolutionary movement. They teach materialism and atheism in their most revoluting forms. The method which they propose to use for the destruction of society and the institution of the new order <b>is beneath scientific consideration.</b>" (Osgood, "Scientific Anarchism", 1889).

<dd>The entire article is her extended definition. It's called "Anarchism: What it Really Stands For" for crying out loud! The article is her attempt at clarifying the basic ideas of anarchism, which to her included anti-capitalism. She didn't say "I have declared war [...], she said "<i>Anarchism</i> has declared war[...]" (emphasis added). Oh, and did you read the paragraph <i>directly following</i> your little selective quote?</dd>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p><i>The new social order rests, of course, on the materialistic basis of life; but while</i> <b>all <i>Anarchists agree that the main evil today is an economic one</i></b><i>, they maintain that the solution of that evil can be brought about only through the consideration of every phase of life,--individual, as well as the collective; the internal, as well as the external phases.</i> (emphasis added)</p>

</dd>
<dd>And before you even say it, I'm not the only one who seems to think the entire essay is her extended definition. In my 11th grade Honors American Lit class we had to write an essay on whether Huck Finn was an anarchist or not (a claim that some critics have stupidly made). Guess what we used as our basis of judging what the key components of anarchist philosophy were. This essay, and we didn't just focus on that one sentence--the parts about religion and property were considered (by our teacher at least) to be necessary ideas within anarchism as a whole. I can't say I'd agree with her, in fact, we argued about some of the details in class (mainly due to the fact that religion isn't <i>inherently</i> bad, it just <i>usually</i> is). Still, she said that we could base our essay <i>only</i> on this essay, and that I (since I was the only one with outside knowledge) couldn't use any other criteria. I still think it was really cool that she passed out anarchist propaganda though. That's still one of my happiest high school memories. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><b><font color="black">Ungovernable Force</font></b></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_6a81.html" title="User talk:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="green"><sup>Got something to say?</sup></font></a> 07:09, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Please read more carefully. Goldman rejects <i>decreed</i> property, citing Proudhon. She rejects "property, the dominion of man's needs, the denial of the right to satisfy his needs." She does not deny property based on natural rights or contract. In her words, "A natural law is that factor in man which asserts itself freely and spontaneously without any external force, in harmony with the requirements of nature." This she contrasts with "man-made" law. As we know, property - the kind Proudhon talks about when he says "Property is liberty" - arises spontaneously in society due to scarcity and the need to distinguish <i>mine from thine</i>. Put another way, anarcho-capitalists reject decreed "man-made law" property, too. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 16:29, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>(edit conflict) And she's wrong. No anarchist communist has ever, to my extensive knowledge, has ever argued that co-operation would entirely supplant competition, rather that the capitalist system focusses exclusively on competition to the detriment of humanity. Rather, the argue that a society that promoted co-operation over competition would be a better one. Further, anarchism is based on voluntary co-operation and a social contract, it can only destroy that which people wish to destroy. Finally, since Proudhon, most anarchists have recognised the distinction between property and possessions. Capital property is theft, possessions - that which one owns and uses - is the individual's to retain or share with the collective or commune. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonnachadelong_ddd0.html" title="User:Donnachadelong">Donnacha</a> 16:34, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"But property, in its derivative sense, and by the definitions of law, is a right outside of society; for it is clear that, if the wealth of each was social wealth, the conditions would be equal for all, and it would be a contradiction to say: Property is a man's right to dispose at will of social property. Then if we are associated for the sake of liberty, equality, and security, we are not associated for the sake of property; then if property is a natural right, this natural right is not social, but anti-social.

<dd>Proudhon was famous as much for his style as for what he said. The rhetorical form of "property is theft" was one he used repeatedly.

<dd>Why don't you <i>at least</i> read all the way through the <i>Selected Writings</i> anthology that is available. That would help this conversation enormously. Proudhon initially doesn't want to talk about two kinds of property relations. He faults Pierre Leroux for doing just that. But his initial rhetorical strategy is not entirely compatible with his mature theory, so he changes rhetorical strategies, continues to reject existing property relations, but champions what he takes to be the <i>aims</i> and <i>desired ends</i> of property. This isn't the clearest strategy either, but <i>Theory of Property</i> takes just this approach. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 17:17, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

I might point out that a source opines that he's wrong, but that's as far as it goes, and that is consistent with the POV policy.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 18:04, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>With Proudhon, you have to look at the context to see if he was talking about decreed property or natural property. In "<a href="http://www.ozarkia.net/bill/anarchism/library/WhatIsProperty/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ozarkia.net/bill/anarchism/library/WhatIsProperty/index.html" rel="nofollow">What is Property</a>" he was writing about decreed property. (Anarcho-capitalism, is Proudhon's "Theory of Property" online somewhere?) In his first work "What is Property," P. tried to make this distinction by calling decreed property "property," and natural (to him labor-based) property "possession." Later he apparently realized that some things, like the product of labor, you had a right to sell, so he went back to the term property for both the decreed kind and the rightfully-owned kind. This ambiguity in terminology makes him hard to fathom, and P's penchant for contradiction doesn't help. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 19:08, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Various differences in translation don't help - Property is theft or Property is robber? Add to that the French use of irony as a different literary device to English and, finally, a very different French academic style and it's extremely difficult to make out. So.... hmmm, where do you find a decent interpretation of Proudhon? A new American idea far detached in time, culture and space? Or those who directly followed Proudhon in developing the ideas - Bakunin, Marx, Engels, Kropotkin, etc. - an interpretation that has endured largely unchallenged for over 100 years?

<dd>The best interpretation of Proudhon is with your own mind by reading his works. The cultural differences should be kept in mind, but shouldn't be overemphasized. Prussian culture and Russian peasant culture is no closer, and perhaps more foreign, to French culture than American culture - so pretending Marx and Kropotkin got it right and Americans got it wrong is disingenious. Proudhonian thought came to America rather quickly through William Weitling, William B. Greene, Charles A. Dana, and Albert Brisbane, Elisee Reclus, and Joseph Dejacques. Greene's Proudhonian book "Mutual Banking" was published in 1850. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 20:55, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are way off, Hogeye. Most educated Europeans at the time would have been fluent in French and would have been very much influenced by French culture, history, and philosophy. Paris was the métropole of Europe. As far as translations are concerned, I am fluent in French, and have read parts of <i>Qu'est-ce que la propriété&#160;?</i>. English translations vary in quality. Either way, I would trust his contemporaries to interpret him better than you. --AaronS 22:14, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Anarcho-Capitalism cites the following quote above from Voltarine de Cleyre to bolster his point, ""Miss Goldman is a communist; I am an individualist. She wishes to destroy the right of property, I wish to assert it. I make my war upon privilege and authority, whereby the right of property, the true right in that which is proper to the individual, is annihilated. She believes that co-operation would entirely supplant competition; I hold that competition in one form or another will always exist, and that it is highly desirable it should." -Voltarine de Cleyre<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 16:28, 27 September 2006 (UTC)." Here are some other quotes from de Cleyre.
<dl>
<dd>"Anarchism...teaches the possibility of a society in which the needs of life may be fully supplied for all, and in which the opportunities for complete development of mind and body shall be the heritage of all... teaches that the present unjust organisation of the production and distribution of wealth must finally be completely destroyed, and replaced by a system which will insure to each the liberty to work, without first seeking a master to whom he must surrender a tithe of his product, which will guarantee his liberty of access to the sources and means of production... Out of the blindly submissive, it makes the discontented; out of the unconsciously dissatisfied, it makes the consciously dissatisfied... Anarchism seeks to arouse the consciousness of oppression, the desire for a better society, and a sense of the necessity for unceasing warfare against capitalism and the State."</dd>
<dd>"The communistic customs of these people are very interesting and very instructive too...,"</dd>
<dd>"the best thing ordinary workingmen or women could do was to organise their industry to get rid of money altogether . . . Let them produce together, co-operatively rather than as employer and employed; let them fraternise group by group, let each use what he needs of his own product, and deposit the rest in the storage-houses, and let those others who need goods have them as occasion arises."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Don't quote de Cleyre for your ancap purposes, she was very anticapitalist.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>She also wrote, "Socialism and Communism both demand a degree of joint effort and administration which would beget more regulation than is wholly consistent with ideal Anarchism; Individualism and Mutualism, resting upon property, involve a development of the private policeman not at all compatible with my notion of freedom."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dd>I think it surreptitious and underhanded the way ancap presented de clerye's quote and that action makes me seriously consider his intentions here. <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlockader_5d3e.html" title="User:Blockader">Blockader</a> 18:24, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The quote I gave was from when De Cleyre was an individualist anarchist. The quote you gave you rejecting individualist anrachism is from later when she changed her mind and became an "anarchist without adjectives." The intention of the quote was to show it was De Cleyre's opinion that Goldman rejected private property and de Cleyre supported it. It certainly wasn't meant to imply that de Cleyre was an anarcho-capitalist. If I think someone is an anarcho-capitalist I will say so.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 18:38, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm quite aware of how you were using the quote, i found it dubious. In 1894 (the date of your quote) de Cleyre did "believe" in property. As early as half a decade later she did not, as evidenced by the quotes i provided in which she makes anti-property asserions like, "and deposit the rest in the storage-houses, and let those others who need goods have them as occasion arises" and "Anarchism...teaches that the present unjust organisation of the production and distribution of wealth must finally be completely destroyed." <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlockader_5d3e.html" title="User:Blockader">Blockader</a> 19:24, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What's your point? I never said she was always an individualist anarchist. We quote Tucker here, but his philosophy changed as well when he turned to Egoist individualist anarchism which contradicted a lot of his early anarchism.

<dd>And, unless I've missed it, Hogeye still hasn't provided a reliable source for his claim that anarchism is commonly defined in two different ways. <a href="../../../v/o/l/User%7EVoluntarySlave_e88b.html" title="User:VoluntarySlave">VoluntarySlave</a> 22:35, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>??? I, and others, have cited numerous dictionaries and luminaries for the anti-statist definition.E.g. Here's Tucker: <i>"the doctrine that all the affairs of men should be managed by individuals or voluntary associations, and that the State should be abolished."</i><a href="http://praxeology.net/BT-SSA.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://praxeology.net/BT-SSA.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Also see Wikiquote and Onelook. Various people have provided sources for the <i>anti-state plus anti-capitalism</i> definition. Half this page is providing quotes and arguing about which def is the right one. Both definitions have been amply sourced, and both definitions have editors championing them. It is clear that there are at least two reasonable definitions. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 05:52, 28 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't think that's enough, though. Your proposed disambiguation page asserts that there are two, and only two, primary definitions of anarchism, which are separate and incompatible with each other. That is, your claim is that the word anarchism has two meanings, not that there is one meaning but a disagreement about how that meaning should be expressed. To claim that the word has two distinct meanings, without a source, is OR. To make a disambiguation page when there is disagreement about the meaning of the word is a POV fork. <a href="../../../v/o/l/User%7EVoluntarySlave_e88b.html" title="User:VoluntarySlave">VoluntarySlave</a> 06:20, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with VoluntarySlave here. Besides, wikiquote is not a legitimate source (especially considering all the debate we had about <i>that</i> page here on this talk page). I think your the main contributor there as well, which was one of the main issues.

<p>I don't mind adding more than two definitions to the NDP. Perhaps we should add the <i>chaos and violent lawlessness</i> definition and redirect to <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anomy.html" title="Anomy">anomy</a>. Even if you don't like Wikiquote, Onelook and the definitions of the various luminaries supports the <i>pure anti-statism</i> def. The various sources appealing to tradition and movements support the second def. In light of the numerous definitions given already, I don't understand how you can say these two meanings are unsourced. Would you like me to cite two different respectable dictionary defs, one giving the <i>anti-state</i> def and the other the <i>anti-state plus anti-capitalism</i> def? What would convince you that these two meanings are used?</p>
<p>Over and above these abundant citations, there is the practical consideration that editors here are adamant about using their <i>one true definition</i>, resulting in permanent edit wars. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 21:28, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's not just the individual definitions that need sourcing. It's the claim that the word "anarchism" has two (or more) different meanings. The obvious interpretation of the diversity of definitions is that the definition of "anarchism" is controversial, not that there are two different (and equally well accepted) definitions. But the latter is what your DP says, so that's what I'd like to see a source for. I'm not at all convinced, by the way, that the disagreements that occur on this page are due to defining the word "anarchism" in different ways. <a href="../../../v/o/l/User%7EVoluntarySlave_e88b.html" title="User:VoluntarySlave">VoluntarySlave</a> 02:14, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Looking at it historically, there was no major disagreement over defining anarchism as both Tucker and Kropotkin called themselves socialists. Tucker would have agreed with Kropotkin's definition of anarchism as "the no-goverment form of socialism." Both the individualists and others were critical of capitalism. Hence Brian Morris:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"The term anarchy comes from the Greek, and essentially means 'no ruler.' Anarchists are people who reject all forms of government or coercive authority, all forms of hierarchy and domination. They are therefore opposed to . . . state, capital and the church. Anarchists are thus opposed to both capitalism and to the state, as well as to all forms of religious authority. But anarchists also seek to establish or bring about by varying means, a condition of anarchy, that is, a decentralised society without coercive institutions, a society organised through a federation of voluntary associations . . when one examines the writings of classical anarchists . . . as well as the character of anarchist movements . . . it is clearly evident that it has never had this limited vision [of just being against the state]. It has always challenged all forms of authority and exploitation, and has been equally critical of capitalism and religion as it has been of the state."</i> (<i>"Anthropology and Anarchism,"</i> <b>Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed</b> no. 45)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Unsurprisingly, he also notes in that essay that "anarcho"-capitalism is not a form of anarchism. The reason we are having this discussion is because Rothbard decided to call his ideology "anarcho-capitalism" in the 1950s and so ignore the whole history of anarchism. Personally, I think (like most anarchists) that we should stick with the traditional definition of anarchism as anti-state and anti-capitalist. "Anarcho"-capitalism should be mentioned as a form of anarchism, but in addition it should be clear and obviously stated that most anarchists reject the claim. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackFlag_0a78.html" title="User:BlackFlag">BlackFlag</a> 11:46, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

And as far as i know (i dont have the source, but ill take a look after it) an arkhos was a position of authority which seems to an official as in most states of our time. The wikitionary translates the word as "ruler, authority" more than precicely an statesman. This last (and i think, most widespread) interpretation creates an image of the word anarchia as being more than just anti-statism, but anti-authority in general (family authority, religious authority, authority at work etc. etc.), while the first one (an Archon being an official of some sort) gives credit to the anti-statism interpretation. I think we should stick to the widest and most known interpretation of anarchia which simply is anti-authority. --<a href="../../../f/j/u/User%7EFjulle_b5aa.html" title="User:Fjulle">Fjulle</a> 13:50, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>From the OED: Etymology of anarchy: [ad. Gr. {alenis}{nu}{alpha}{rho}{chi}{giacu}{alpha}, n. of state f. {alenisacu}{nu}{alpha}{rho}{chi}-{omicron}{fsigma} without a chief or head, f. {alenis}{nu} priv. + {alenis}{rho}{chi}{goacu}{fsigma} leader, chief. The word was also adopted in med.L. anarchia, and Fr. anarchie (Cotgr. 1611), from one or other of which the Eng. may have been immediately taken.] Etymology of archon: [a. Gr. {alenisacu}{rho}{chi}{omega}{nu} ruler, magistrate, pr. pple. of {alenisacu}{rho}{chi}-{epsilon}{iota}{nu} to rule.] Etymology of the arch- prefix:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>repr. Gr. {alenis}{rho}{chi}{iota}-, {alenis}{rho}{chi}'-, comb. form of {alenis}{rho}{chi}-{goacu}{fsigma} chief (cogn. w. {alenisacu}{rho}{chi}-{epsilon}{iota}{nu} to begin, take the lead), as in {alenis}{rho}{chi}{iota}-{delta}{iota}{gaacu}{kappa}{omicron}{nu}{omicron}{fsigma} chief-minister, {alenis}{rho}{chi}{iota}-{epsilon}{pi}{giacu}{sigma}{kappa}{omicron}{pi}{omicron}{fsigma} chief-bishop, {alenis}{rho}{chi}-{gaacu}{gamma}{gamma}{epsilon}{lambda}{omicron}{fsigma} chief-angel. Hence in later L. archidi{amac}conus, archiepiscopus, archangelus; in OF. arce-archediacne, arce-archevesque, arc-archangele. (In L. the ch was treated as c; hence, in Romanic, it remained = k in archangelus; in other words, it became in It. arce-, arci-, Pr., Sp., Pg. arce, OF. arce-, later arche-; whence G. erz-, Du. aarts-.) In OE. at first translated by héah- high (héah-diacon, héah-biscop, héah-{ehook}ngel, etc.), but also at length adopted from L. as arce-, ærce-, {ehook}rce- (? orig. arci-), in {ehook}rce-diacon, {ehook}rce-biscop, {ehook}rce-stól arch-see, {ehook}rce-hád archiepiscopal dignity. The OE. {ehook}rce-, arce-, became in ME. erche-, arche-, the latter coinciding with OF. arche-, whence also archangel was added. From these, in later times, arch- became a living formative, prefixable to any name of office. The same happened in med.L. and most mod. langs.; hence many of the Eng. examples, e.g. archduke, are adaptations of foreign titles. Since the 16th c., arch- has been freely prefixed to names of agents and appellatives (like arci- in Ital., and archi- in French, as archifou, archipédant); in a few instances also to appellations of things, and occasionally even to adjectives. Finally, from its faculty of being prefixed to any appellative, arch has gradually come to be a separate adjective; see prec. word. (In modern literary words from Gr., the prefix is, in Eng., as in all the Romance langs., ARCHI- q.v.) In pronunciation, the compounds of arch- have two accents, either of which may be the stronger, according to emphasis, as in right hand. But established compounds, as archangel, -bishop, -deacon, -duke, tend to have the main stress on arch-, especially when they are prefixed to a name, as, the {sm}Archduke {sm}Charles, {sm}Archbishop {sm}Cranmer. As a prefix the usual sense is ‘chief, principal, high, leading, prime,’ occasionally ‘first in time, original, initial,’ but in modern use it is chiefly prefixed intensively to words of bad or odious sense, as in arch-traitor, arch-enemy, arch-rogue. 1. a. In titles of office, rank, or dignity: meaning, ‘Chief, principal, -in-chief; superior, master-; one who occupies a position or rank above those who bear the simple title’; as ARCHBISHOP, ARCHDEACON, ARCHDUKE; arch-beadle, -brahmin, -chaplain, -druid, -eunuch (Gr. {alenis}{rho}{chi}{iota}{epsilon}{upsilon}{nu}{omicron}{gufrown}{chi}{omicron}{fsigma}), -gunner (obs.), -ma{sm}girist (Gr. {alenis}{rho}{chi}{iota}-{mu}{gaacu}{gamma}{epsilon}{iota}{rho}{omicron}{fsigma}) chief cook, -mime (= ARCHIMIME), -minister, -phylarch chief magistrate of the tribe, -satrap, -visitor; especially in many titles of offices in the Holy Roman or German empire, as arch-butler, -chamberlain, -chancellor, -count, -cupbearer; arch-dapifer, chief sewer, whose office it was to carry on horseback the first meal to the newly-crowned emperor, whence archdapifership; arch-earl, -marshal, -sewer, -steward, -treasurer, b. In appellations formed after these, and applied in a similar sense, as arch-apostle chief apostle, or chief of the apostles; arch-chief, -corsair, -dæmon, -emperor, -engineer, -genethliac (Gr. {gamma}{epsilon}{nu}{epsilon}{theta}{lambda}{iota}{alpha}{kappa}{goacu}{fsigma}) chief caster of nativities, -governor, -magician, -patriarch, -pontiff, -primate, -prince, -publican, -regent, -ruler, -sacrificator, -sacrificer, -shepherd, -vestryman, -workmaster.</p>

<p>Here's a quote <i>about</i> the etymology:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Another of Proudhon's startling paradoxes, seemingly so at least, and I think we shall see really so, is the use of the term anarchy, to denote not chaos and confusion, but the basis of order in the freedom of the individual from the control of others. Etymologically, this use of the term has a show of reason as it merely means <i>absence of government</i>, and a writer has the right, if he choose so to revert to etymological origins; and frequently there is a great advantage in so doing." - "Proudhon and His Translator" by Stephen Pearl Andrews<a href="http://libertarian-labyrinth.org/theindex/1876-tucker-andrews.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://libertarian-labyrinth.org/theindex/1876-tucker-andrews.pdf" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></dd>

<p>"The word anarchy comes from the ancient Greek word...The etymology of the word - anarchism meaning the absence of a leader, the absence of a government - signals what is distinctive about anarchism: a rejection of the need for the centralized authority of the unitary state, the only form of government most of us have ever experienced. The concept of the state is inseparable from the notion of authority within a society...A distinction that is relevant to the anarchist ideal is the difference between the government, referring to the state, and government, referring to the administration of a political system. Anarchists, like everyone, tend to use the word government as a synonym for the state, but what is rejected by anarchism's a priori opposition to the state is not the concept of government as such but the idea of a sovereign order that claims and demand the obedience, and if necessary the lives, of its subjects. Anarchism rejects that form of imposed, centralized authority enshrined and made material by the state." Sheehan, Sean.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Discussion of Schools of anarchism</span></h2>
<p>I cast an eye over the article in it's current form, and I must say I find myself rather unimpressed. Currently the American Individualist section is about the size of anarchist collectivism, anarchist communism and anarcho-syndicalism put together. Strange that the descriptions of the other schools were butchered yet the individualist ones remain. Also disappointing, since I and a few other editors have put hard work into creating an informative article. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_Intentions_d6f9.html" title="User:Good Intentions"><b>G</b><small>ood</small><b>I</b><small>ntentions</small></a><sup><a href="../../../g/o/o/User_talk%7EGood_Intentions_ebc9.html" title="User talk:Good Intentions">talk</a></sup> 05:29, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I dont get why Stirner, the Individualist anarchist of the US and anCap gets a speciel place of honour in the individualist section either. Its strange, because who can say which is the most influencial: fx Stirner or Bakunin. Beyound that i dont get why theres this anarchist schools at all. It seems to me that the index which is used by Ward in anarchism (AVSI) is far better in illustrating 1) the different ideeological discurses and that 2) theres not schools in an traditional way in anarchism (anCap probably being closest to what might be called a school), rather different individuals working in different ways with different people at different times. --<a href="../../../f/j/u/User%7EFjulle_b5aa.html" title="User:Fjulle">Fjulle</a> 10:23, 29 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Because Stirner has a different type of individualist anarchism than the American form. Maybe it should probably be called "Egoism." Stirner is the first Egoist individualist. Maybe the section should be renamed "Egoism." There are other Egoists besides Stirner. We could add a couple other names.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 15:05, 29 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I know he is a different type, its implicit in my statement, but anyway, ill try again: Even though he is of a different type, that doesnt mean this type is anymore important, so important that fx bakunin (mutualist or collectivist) or kropotkin (communist anarchism) doesnt get a place somewhere. Because both Bakunin and Kropotkin are different types of anarchism too, so are all others. Why should we favour Stirner? Id suggest:</dd>
<dd>1) we boil Stirner, US individualistd, anCap and the introduction to the individualist anarchist section down so that the whole individualist section fits the size of the other section, and go in details in the individualist anarchist article... or</dd>
<dd>2) We reconsider the whole structure. My suggestion is Ward kinda style.</dd>

<dd>Stirner never called himself an anarchist, either. I wouldn't mind using Ward as a model. --AaronS 14:24, 29 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Just because you don't call yourself an anarchist it doesn't mean you aren't one. All sources I've ever seen say he's an anarchist. Godwin was the first anarchist, but he didn't call himself one either. Josiah Warren never called himself one.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 15:05, 29 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In normal circumstances, particularly post-Proudhon, it means exactly that - if people choose not to call themselves anarchists, you should respect their choice (that applies to Gandhi, libertarians and all others). However, Godwin and Warren are special cases because they are direct predecessors of the movements and proposed clearly anarchist ideas in a time when the term had not entered common use. Stirner is more difficult, while his philosophy was hugely influential on anarchism (not just individualist), there are clear points of difference. He had no real position on the state, for one. He used the term Egoism and, while its influence on anarchism should be noted, it's incorrect to call him an anarchist when he chose not to himself. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonnachadelong_ddd0.html" title="User:Donnachadelong">Donnacha</a> 15:35, 29 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Then you're disagreeing with all that people out there that study anarchism. "Max Stirner is the most individualistic and 'egoistic' of the anarchist thinkers." The Oxford Companion to Philosophy, 2005; "Both Godwin and Stirner developed versions of anarchist doctrine based on individualism, but there the resemblance ends." Adams, Ian, Political Ideology Today, page 117; "[Stirner's] name appears with familiar regularity in historically-orientated surveys of anarchist thought as one of the earliest and best-known exponents of individualist anarchism." Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy; "Some anarchist thinkers, such as the German Max Stirner, refused to recognize any limitation on the individual's right to do as he pleases or any obligation to act socially..." Encyclopedia Britannica, Anarchism. You're mistaken that he has no position on the state. His position is that if everyone turn egoist then the state will fall apart. The only reason it exists is because people are letting it exists because they have an illusion that the self needs an authority.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 15:48, 29 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Strangely enough, I do tend to question authority. You'll find most real anarchists tend to do that. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonnachadelong_ddd0.html" title="User:Donnachadelong">Donnacha</a> 16:06, 29 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"Does it follow that I reject all authority? Far from me such a thought...I bow before the authority of special men because it is imposed on me by my own reason. I am conscious of my own inability to grasp, in all its detail, and positive development, any very large portion of human knowledge. The greatest intelligence would not be equal to a comprehension of the whole. Thence results, for science as well as for industry, the necessity of the division and association of labour. I receive and I give - such is human life. Each directs and is directed in his turn. Therefore there is no fixed and constant authority, but a continual exchange of mutual, temporary, and, above all, voluntary authority and subordination." -Michael Bakunin, What is Authority?

<dd>Much of what goodintentions and Fjulle mention above have also been concerns of mine since the last unlocking of the article led to massive contraversial edits which shortened all the social anarchist school's sections, removed kropotkin, changed the intro, but interestingly enough left the indiv sections largely untouched. i think the article as it stands now is pretty pitiful and it should be returned to the state in which it existed at the last unlocking so the large amounts of important info can be returned. stirner/tucker should stay, of course, but kropotkin and the info on the social schools had no business being removed imo. i too would be fine using Ward as a model. <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlockader_5d3e.html" title="User:Blockader">Blockader</a> 15:29, 29 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Back then, three archive pages ago, I was aiming at something different than what we are aiming for now - conciseness. There was mention of no thinker past Proudhon after I was done - it was certainly more concise and a concession I was willing to make for removing the page-long epic on Rothbard. I'm still not convinced that we need a section on Proudhon, or even Godwin, right there at the top of the article - I'd prefer something like the Stirnerite section which is admirably free from talk of Stirner. You'll also see that the sections I deleted (not quite "most of it") from the an-com section were rather contentious, unnecessary and biased attacks on the movement, the type of bickering that is unbecoming of an encyclopedia and which I remove on sight from wherever (you should have seen the point-for-point attack on Tucker from Rothbard's perspective which I also removed). --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_Intentions_d6f9.html" title="User:Good Intentions"><b>G</b><small>ood</small><b>I</b><small>ntentions</small></a><sup><a href="../../../g/o/o/User_talk%7EGood_Intentions_ebc9.html" title="User talk:Good Intentions">talk</a></sup> 01:59, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The purpose of discussion pages is so that editors can discuss ideas etc and come to a consensus before making changes. your neutral disambiguation idea was discussed on this page extensively and almost noone from any perspective/stance supported it. therefore it is in bad faith to post the page against the consensus of the group. i think you should be blocked for such actions as they are obviously meant to engender further dispute and perpetuate the contentious atmosphere that you seem to get off on. <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlockader_5d3e.html" title="User:Blockader">Blockader</a> 19:42, 29 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A disambiguation page does <i>not</i> violate the forking policy.

If you don't care to work on either article, that's fine - but no reason to vandalize. Those who wish may argue here to their heart's content and stare at a locked page.

<dd>NO, I'm saying that there aren't definitions that say, as you put it, "anarchism is necessarily anti-capitalist" so there's no reason for a disambiguation. <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 01:54, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What about Bakunin's definition? There are a couple of other luminaries that also give anti-capitalist definitions.

<dl>
<dd>Bakunin's definition is irrelevant. You can't take a definition from an actual anarchist "luminary" bloviating about his own anarchism. You have to use the definition from a more independant observer who studies anarchism. Rothbard said that "capitalism is the fullest expression of anarchism" but his definition doesn't matter either. <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 02:06, 1 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That isn't Rothbard's definition of anarchism. Rothbard considered Godwin a communist anarchist, so probably Rothbard would agree with our <i>pure anti-statism</i> definition. I agree with you that the correct def is the anti-state def, but there are a lot of crazy editors here that feel strongly that anarchism is necessarily anti-capitalist. They're wrong, but there's a bunch of them and I say we should give them their mistaken definition so they can play in their own sandbox and not feel like they have to vandalize articles to promote their view. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 02:17, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

But really it should go to <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_%28social%29.html" title="Anarchism (social)">anarchism (social)</a> which covers all of anarchism (by their definition).

<dl>
<dd>The most basic distinction is between social and individualist anarchism. I think what a lot of people have in mind when they think of anarchism is social anarchism. When they think of anarchism they think of opposition to private property and markets. So if there is a disambiguation maybe it should be between social and individualist.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 03:08, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There are already articles about that distinction: <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_Anarchism_890f.html" title="Social Anarchism">Social Anarchism</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/d/Individualist_anarchism.html" title="Individualist anarchism">Individualist anarchism</a>. The disambiguation here is about an overall anarchism article - whether it should cover all pure anti-statist philosophies, or just the ones that are anti-capitalist. IOW Broad-tent vs. anti-cap only. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 03:21, 1 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yet more equivocation from Hogeye. Nobody has ever suggested that this article should exclude anarcho-capitalism. The question is regarding its place and treatment. Further, there has never been an anti-statist/anti-capitalist dichotomy; if anything, there has been an anti-authoritarian/anti-statist dichotomy. I know that you like to dress up your argument as being more "open," but, really, anti-authoritarianism is a much broader term than anti-statism. --AaronS 05:06, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Hogeye, you said that it's better to work on these other pages than to sit here and look at a locked page. Well, the page is locked for a reason, mainly that there isn't a consensus as to the whole anarchist-capitalism issue and other issues.

<p>We gain nothing from a NDP which is neither particularly <i>neutral</i> nor <i>disambiguating.</i> The problem is far from insurmountable in a single entry, <i>provided</i> people are willing to work together even minimally. More than anything else, an <i>inclusive</i> article requires that the various factions find means not to sabotage one another. Since this is a general page, with links to numerous more specific pages, we can be fairly inclusive and fairly strict at the same time. Here's a few possible principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acknowledge that there is disagreement on the meaning of key terms, including <i>socialism</i>. This is an old issue, acknowledged by Tucker in "Socialism and the Lexicographers"<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[6]</a></sup> in 1892. We won't solve it here. Plenty of anarchists, including some <a href="http://www.bradspangler.com/blog/archives/473" class="external text" title="http://www.bradspangler.com/blog/archives/473" rel="nofollow">Rothbardian individualists</a>, consider themselves "socialist."</li>
<li>Treat definitional issues in the context of a historical account, <i>inclusively</i> but avoiding anachronism. This means there is a place for Molinari as a <i>proto-anarcho-capitalist</i>, a distinction which respects the current conflict over the term and the historical distance between figures like Molinari and those who called themselves <i>anarchists</i> at the time.</li>
<li>Simply leave out generalizations that can't be supported by the mass of facts. That means we stop reasoning from the labels to the practices, as if the words <i>individualist anarchist</i> or <i>mutualist</i> definitely corresponded to certain social, political, or economic doctrines. We know this was not the case. <i>And</i> we know that most of the conflict and gaming of the Wikipedia system comes from attempts to manipulate generalities.</li>
<li>By all means, let's have our little "source wars," and let competition to dig up relevant facts spur more complete entries. But let's keep them on the talk pages until the data is collected.</li>
</ul>
<p>I see absolutely no reason, barring sheer cussedness on the part of individual editors, this article can't be written. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 17:08, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You have some good points, Libertatia. The first, <i>acknowledge that there is disagreement on the meaning of key terms</i>, is great. Eventually, I figure enough people will get tired of edit wars to acknowledge the two main definitions of "anarchism." Point two seems problematic: Do you really think we can call Proudhon and Tucker "pseudo-socialists" without an edit war? Then again, you say "<i>inclusively but avoiding anachronism</i>." So perhaps we should write: Molinari was an anarcho-capitalist, but called himself an "economist." And: Tucker was not a socialist by current definitions, however he called himself one. <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 22:55, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're unbelievable, you know that? You constantly oppose the normal description and definition of anarchism by adding its opposite (capitalism), yet you claim there is <i>one</i> modern definition of socialism. There isn't, mutualism is as much a part of socialism as communism. There are plans to rework the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialism.html" title="Socialism">Socialism</a> page to properly reflect that. Tucker was a socialist and those who do not call themselves anarchists should not be described as such. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonnachadelong_ddd0.html" title="User:Donnachadelong">Donnacha</a> 23:44, 30 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Tucker was not a socialist. Socialism today is defined as state or community ownership of the means of production. Tucker did not support that. <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 01:56, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>And again, whether someone calls themselves an "anarchist" or not has no bearing on whether they actually are an anarchist. For instance, Godwin is considered an anarchist by practically everyone who studies anarchism but never called himself an anarchist. "Anarchist" used to be an insult, so people didn't claim the term, until Proudhon broke the mold. Do you honestly think Proudhon was the first anarchist? <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 01:59, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would like to point out that Encarta's entry for anarchism, found at <a href="http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568770/Anarchism.html" class="external free" title="http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568770/Anarchism.html" rel="nofollow">http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568770/Anarchism.html</a>, makes a distinction between Proudhonian philosophical anarchy, which is characterized as "extreme individualism," and "another school of anarchism, relying on organized action and even deeds of terror to achieve its purposes, grew out of the socialist movement and appeared toward the end of the 19th century." I cannot access the article text, but judging from the table of contents, Encyclopædia Britannica also appears to be breaking anarchism into at least two schools of thought. I hope this goes to clarifying the accuracy of the viewpoint that anarchism involves two distinctly opposing schools. - <a href="../../../m/s/t/User%7EMSTCrow_5721.html" title="User:MSTCrow">MSTCrow</a> 06:02, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think anyone is going to disagree that there are two broad schools of anarchism (social and invidiualist); but, as he made clear above, this division doesn't map to Hogeye's two pages, which he has still failed to give any reliable sources for. Further, I'm not sure how accurate it is to call individualism and collectivism "distinctly opposing schools" - they're distinct, sure, but there's been a certain amount of overlap, historically.<a href="../../../v/o/l/User%7EVoluntarySlave_e88b.html" title="User:VoluntarySlave">VoluntarySlave</a> 00:22, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Anarchism in Taoism and Stoicism</span></h2>
<p>If the page ever gets unlocked, this is for that time (just to get going a bit further in discussing something out of the present discourse). In reading the Origins section of the anarchism article, its references and the Origins of anarchism article ive come to the conclusion that the perspective on Taoism and Stoicism is really quite onesided. Most of all in the Origins of anarchism article, but also, especially when considering Taoism, the Origin section. The reference to the article which compares anarchism with taoism is both critical and optimistic as to how much these two have in common. Fx the article states that Tao te Ching is viewed by the Chinese scholar D. C. Lau as having "a primarily ethical rather than mystical or philosophical import, and which does not question the concept of political rule. In his view, passages concerning the sage or ruler apply to any follower of the Tao, but are also specific references to an enlightened and skillful “ruler,” in a quite literal sense.". I think it would be to take the source serious in all its perspectives if we where to put a line under the Tao and Stoic part of the Origins section in the Anarchism article which states that the comparison between Taoism and Anarchism is a controversy. In the Origins of anarchism article there is need of a view of the bigger picture in details, something which would be too long for the Origins section. About the Stoic Zeno, ive got some objections which is nothing but a reference to the views of Zeno in regard to metaphysics and ethics. I havnt got a source which actually contests the comparison of anarchism to stoicism in Zeno, but i have some objections myself. If i find any source that backs me up ill put it here. --<a href="../../../f/j/u/User%7EFjulle_b5aa.html" title="User:Fjulle">Fjulle</a> 12:02, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Anarcho-capitalism is a form of individualist anarchism. There are two main kinds of anarchism, social anarchism and individualist anarchism.

<p>I would like this article to be as short as possible, offering as much information and as little discussion as we can bear. It is my opinion that Wikipedia, or any encyclopedia, has no business serving as a place for polemics. I am perfectly happy to allow whatever ill-considered philosophy its place in Wiki. Even the Flat Earther deserve to have their space online wherein they can as factually as possible describe their movement. Therefore: 1) A short introductory paragraph, much like we have now.</p>
<p>2) A short rundown of anarchist trends in history pre-C19 - especially Godwin who first gave a fully-fleshed, clearly anarchist political philosophy. Mention the Enlightenment liberalism that Proudhon took to a logical extreme, the similar, and then describe in short how Proudhon's anarchism came about, it being the first self-described "anarchism", mature anarchism if you will.</p>
<p>3)Schools of Anarchist Thought: rundown of the various existent schools. Perhaps we can drop Stirnerite Egotism and historic American Individualist Anarchism (Warren-Tucker-Spooner) to a History of Anarchism section, since nobody practices them anymore (not to my knowledge). If we do this they deserve very prominent mention in the history section. They can be replaced with a more general individualist anarchism section.</p>
<p>4)Anarchist Figures: Proudhon, Bakunin, Kropotkin, Goldman. I'd argue for a section on Bookchin as well.</p>
<p>5)Remainder of article as it exists now.</p>
<p>Points to repeat: No polemics, no evangelising, no attacks on movements, and brevity!</p>
<p>This article should serve as a concise general introduction whereby we lead the reader to whatever fleshed-out section he might desire, rather than trying to store every noteworthy fact in one place. We have hypertext, let's use it. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_Intentions_d6f9.html" title="User:Good Intentions"><b>G</b><small>ood</small><b>I</b><small>ntentions</small></a><sup><a href="../../../g/o/o/User_talk%7EGood_Intentions_ebc9.html" title="User talk:Good Intentions">talk</a></sup> 02:25, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>AIA exists mostly in the form of anarcho-capitalism. I think each kind of anarchism should be discussed as much as it takes to make each kind understandable. Each kind should be criticized as well. Right now only the individualist anarchisms are criticized.

<dd>I'd not call an-cap an extension of AIA, which is why I'd give it a seperate mention as a school, but that is a different discussion. I <i>do not</i> think each, or any, school should be criticised, and I've always removed such sectarian attacks on sight. However, saying that the majority of anarchists do not recognise an-cap isn't a criticism, not in the "Rothbard considered Tucker a flawed economist" sense. No one can deny the gulf between socialist anarchism and an-cap, which is what the section says in all fairness. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_Intentions_d6f9.html" title="User:Good Intentions"><b>G</b><small>ood</small><b>I</b><small>ntentions</small></a><sup><a href="../../../g/o/o/User_talk%7EGood_Intentions_ebc9.html" title="User talk:Good Intentions">talk</a></sup> 03:09, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>I think we should avoid using wage labour as a defining element of IA. I'm not sure about Warren, and Tucker gives it his half-hearted support, but Spooner attacked wage labour vehemently. I think it's more accurate to talk about compensation for labour: all individualist anarchists stress the importance in self-ownership of the means of production, thereby receiving a share of the profits (Tucker's support for wage labour extends exactly as far as that wage is an equal share of the profits). It's just that wage labour traditionally is a <i>very</i> sticky issue for anarchists and should be treated carefully. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_Intentions_d6f9.html" title="User:Good Intentions"><b>G</b><small>ood</small><b>I</b><small>ntentions</small></a><sup><a href="../../../g/o/o/User_talk%7EGood_Intentions_ebc9.html" title="User talk:Good Intentions">talk</a></sup> 03:23, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can live with that. That's a narrower definition of market socialism than I learnt, but the one stated on Wiki. All I wanted to say with that claim is that it is a socialism that seeks to exist in a free market (like mutualism). To talk about free market socialism is a sublime joke at the expense of mainstream (and impoverished) discussions of capitalism and socialism. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_Intentions_d6f9.html" title="User:Good Intentions"><b>G</b><small>ood</small><b>I</b><small>ntentions</small></a><sup><a href="../../../g/o/o/User_talk%7EGood_Intentions_ebc9.html" title="User talk:Good Intentions">talk</a></sup> 04:11, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It is not socialism at all by any modern definition of the term. In socialism there is not private ownership of the means of production. Benjamin Tucker called his system "Anarchistic socialism" but that is by his own unique definition, before socialism meant what it means today. It doesn't make sense to say it is a form of socialism without clarifying that's it's not socialism as defined today.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 04:15, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Where have you got this definition of socialism? Its quite narrow, esepcially when looking through wikipedia about different kind of socialism. Take fx Social democracy which uses "Regulatory systems over private enterprise in the interests of workers, consumers and small enterprise." Which means here private ownership is permitted (Note: Not all social democratic parties call themselves socialist anymore, but it doesnt change the fact that theyve supported private ownership for as long as theyve got power anywhere). Also theres democratic socialism, which is for those a bit more to the left than social democrats. Wikipedia states that "Democratic socialists usually support re-distribution of wealth and power, social ownership of major industries, and a planned economy." which means that theres a limit to private ownership, but still that its possible. Both with social democrats and democratic socialists theres private ownership, but not so unregulated as in Liberalism or anarcho-capitalism. To say that in socialism theres no private ownership is to say the concept is unambiguous on account of private property, which it isnt. --<a href="../../../f/j/u/User%7EFjulle_b5aa.html" title="User:Fjulle">Fjulle</a> 16:47, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It <b>is</b> socialism - "as defined today" is a euphanism for "as defined by marxists and their enemies". The only prerequisite for socialism is that one is not seperated from the products of one's labour - in AIA this is accomplished by each labourer owning the means of production or a part thereof. Tucker supported wage labour only where its result would be equivalent to ownership of the means of production. Because each person has access to the means of production it is socialised. The LTV is by definition socialist. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_Intentions_d6f9.html" title="User:Good Intentions"><b>G</b><small>ood</small><b>I</b><small>ntentions</small></a><sup><a href="../../../g/o/o/User_talk%7EGood_Intentions_ebc9.html" title="User talk:Good Intentions">talk</a></sup> 05:57, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>An-Cap also supports the alienation of the individual from the means of production, which AIA does not. That makes an-cap capitalistic, and AIA socialistic.

AIA fought tooth and nail against an economic distinction between the owners and the workers of the means of production - for them they have to be one and the same. That is what LTV means. That is what socialism means. But because this is a rather complex subject I've left it out of the section (to the degree that it depends on me) - it's enough to state that they thought of themselves as socialists, and that they assuredly weren't capitalists. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_Intentions_d6f9.html" title="User:Good Intentions"><b>G</b><small>ood</small><b>I</b><small>ntentions</small></a><sup><a href="../../../g/o/o/User_talk%7EGood_Intentions_ebc9.html" title="User talk:Good Intentions">talk</a></sup> 06:08, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

See the <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_appropriation.html" title="Original appropriation">original appropriation</a> article. You're definining profit in terms of the labor theory of value. No one defines it like that today. For Tucker, the employee must also accept whatever wage was negotiated. Do you think he would allow the employee to aggress against the employer? Of course not.

<dd>"The basic axiom of libertarian political theory holds that every man is a self owner, having absolute jurisdiction over his own body. In effect, this means that no one else may justly invade, or aggress against, another's person. It follows then that each person justly owns whatever previously unowned resources he appropriates or "mixes his labor with." From these twin axioms — self-ownership and "homesteading" — stem the justification for the entire system of property rights titles in a free-market society." ----Rothbard.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 06:46, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is no "the" labor theory of value. They had their own labor theory of value. They thought that if value is proportional to price, because of their interpretation of Adam Smith, and though that therefore everyone who exerts the same amount of labor should receive the same wage. If they don't then there is something wrong. Somebody is being exploited. And, in addition to that, Benjamin Tucker thought that if the state stopped regulating the banking industry that it would cause wages to line up with labor exerted because there was more money to go around.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Anarcho-syndicalism</span></h2>
<p>I've been thinking recently that it's not really correct to call anarcho-syndicalism a school of thought, it's a form of tactical organisation to achieve collectivist or communist anarchism, not a distinct principle. It was a development of previous forms of organisation that came with the development of the labour movement, not a break from past ideas. Any thoughts? <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonnachadelong_ddd0.html" title="User:Donnachadelong">Donnacha</a> 10:22, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Its true that anarcho-syndicalism is not mutually exclusive of other schools and that one might be a ancom, ancol, etc and simultaneously be a syndicalist. that seems to be the case most often actually. however, i am unsure of removing or even moving the section as it is a historically and currently important aspect of anarchism and could, I believe, be considered a school of thought (just not a mutually exclusive one). Maybe it would be best to note this particular aspect of ansynd in the section. <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlockader_5d3e.html" title="User:Blockader">Blockader</a> 15:25, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Syndicalism should definately keep its place as a school, for two reasons: as a school of thought it is clearly distinct from an-com and an-col, with its own set of concerns and dilemnas; also, it's been the form of anarchism with the greatest historic impact, by quite some margin. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_Intentions_d6f9.html" title="User:Good Intentions"><b>G</b><small>ood</small><b>I</b><small>ntentions</small></a><sup><a href="../../../g/o/o/User_talk%7EGood_Intentions_ebc9.html" title="User talk:Good Intentions">talk</a></sup> 03:33, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Why is Henry David Thoreau listed as supporting free market national defense? He protested the Spanish American War by not paying taxes. He was an individualist, but the individualist anarchism passage implies that all individualist anarchists are united by belief in free market defense, which is misleading.

<dd><i>"First, it is sometimes argued that the distinguishing feature of anarchism was an intense distaste for any form of authority. This may describe the general style of both contemporary and past anarchists; but the actual views of the major anarchist theoreticians do not provide evidence for this claim, even apart from arguments about the potentially authoritarian nature of some anarchist ideas about community. The fact is that anarchist thinkers were not against all authority so much as they were against the authority of the state, or political authority. Authority as defined as that to which one owes moral obedience, was never rejected in principle, even when political obligation was...The classical anarchist ideal, then, did not banish authority. While anarchists undertook to destroy political authority of men over other men, ordinarily they were anxious to establish natural authority."</i></dd>

<dd>I agree that not all anarchists oppose authority. Bakunin said he he was fine with "voluntary authority and subordination." And if you look at anarcho-communism that is obviously a form of authority over the individual.

<dd>(edit conflict) Firstly, what kind of lunatic opposes all authority? Anarchism is opposed to coercive authority. A doctor has authority as a result of training, academics are authorities in their field. There are also legitimate cases whereby authority can be imposed - if someone is choking, a doctor <i>should</i> force people to get out of the way and inflict a certain amount of physical force, even if there is resistance, to save a life. A parent should physically prevent a child from running into the road, etc, etc, etc. As for communism, once again one of you sectarians ignores the fundamental principle of voluntary cooperation. If, and only if, the majority of people <i>choose</i> communism can it become real. It <i>cannot</i> be imposed by force in anarchism. Expropriation would only be in the case where capitalist monopolisation of the means of production were denying a commune the ability to survive. The MST expropriates land to live on. That's not coercive authority. The monopolisation of land in Brazil is coercive authority, maintained by exactly the violent private security <i>you</i> advocate.</dd>

<blockquote>
<p>" It is in much the same fashion that the shrewd heads among the middle classes reason when they say, "Ah, Expropriation! I know what that means. You take all the overcoats and lay them in a heap, and every one is free to help himself and fight for the best. But such jests are irrelevant as well as flippant. What we want is not a redistribution of overcoats, although it must be said that even in such a case, the shivering folk would see advantage in it. Nor do we want to divide up the wealth of the Rothschilds. What we do want is so to arrange things that every human being born into the world shall be ensured the opportunity in the first instance of learning some useful occupation, and of becoming skilled in it; next, that he shall be free to work at his trade without asking leave of master or owner, and without handing over to landlord or capitalist the lion's share of what he produces. As to the wealth held by the Rothschilds or the Vanderbilts, it will serve us to organize our system of communal production." - Kropotkin, "<a href="http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/ANARCHIST_ARCHIVES/kropotkin/conquest/ch4.html" class="external text" title="http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/ANARCHIST_ARCHIVES/kropotkin/conquest/ch4.html" rel="nofollow">The Conquest of Bread</a>"</p>

<dd>I was going to clarify this, but you got in before me. If the only choice available to me to get enough money to eat, to afford somewhere to live and to buy clothes and other necessities is to become someone else's employee and follow their rules, that's not a free choice. Social welfare has softened the situation in most parts of the world, but it still remains true. If others profit from my work, that's theft. A free choice would be between becoming someone's employee or having access to the means of survival without doing so. "Anarcho"-capitalism, by supporting wage slavery while arguing for an end to state-provided benefits such as welfare, would, in fact, make life a living hell for most people. That's why it's not anarchism. Anarchism is not becoming an employee, it's taking over the factory, cutting out the leeching share-holders and getting rid of the bosses. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonnachadelong_ddd0.html" title="User:Donnachadelong">Donnacha</a> 23:26, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

Most people simply prefer to be employees because it's less challenging. Social welfare is tyrannical. It deprives the individual of the product of his labor. Anarcho-capitalists don't support wage "slavery." They support voluntary contracts. Profit is not "theft" except according to twisted labor theory of value that no economist takes seriously. Your labor is worth no more, and no less, than what someone is willing to pay for it.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 23:49, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>And shareholders are not "leeches." Shareholders simply want to be compensated for their labor. Anti-capitalists don't realize that subjecting yourself to the risking of losing what you own is a form of labor and that's why people pay to use capital. Without investment, no jobs are not created and you're left to create your own job (or hope everybody turns communist and is content to not be paid for their work *laugh*). By the way are you calling my grandma who purchased of large block of AT&amp;T shares so she didn't have to work until death a "leech?"<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 00:00, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for proving, if proof were needed, that "anarcho"-capitalism is everything anarchism is not - greedy, egotistical, elitist and anti-humanist. Your theories have no grounding in any kind of reality I'm aware of, which is why "anarcho"-capitalism is the domain of well fed, lazy academics who've probably never done a day's real work in their lives. Oh, and by the way, anarcho-communists reject the labour theory of value as impossible to measure and thus support the economy of need, and most anarcho-syndicalists are communists, thus meaning that the majority of anarchists worldwide reject the labour theory of value. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonnachadelong_ddd0.html" title="User:Donnachadelong">Donnacha</a> 23:59, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No offense to your grandmother, but yes, she had the misfortune to live in a system that turns almost everyone into a slave or a leech. You are so trapped in a mindset of capitalism and greed that you can't see the wood for the trees. People call anarchism utopian because anarchists are people who image a better world and try to figure out how it can be brought about. You Rothbardists see a world that sucks and look to see how you can profit from it. Go to Brazilian countryside and see what your <i>theories</i> would bring about.

<dd>If an anarcho-communist asserts that I can't turn unowned land into my own private property then he himself asserting himself as the owner of that land because he is keeping me from taking it. So anarcho-communism is contradictory. It's not a denial of property at all, but an assertion that anarcho-communists own the land just by saying so but I can't turn land into my property though labor.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 01:10, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This isn't the place to go into it, but it really isn't as simple as that. You can have individual ownership of socialised means of production - it depends on the type of ownership in that society, of which there are a broad spectrum. You are looking at only two forms of ownership - exclusive (capitalist) and communal (communist). Syndicalism would have the syndicates own the MoP, and that would be socialist, even if each person has a specific private share of the syndicate he is a member of (why co-operatives are, or are able to be, socialist in a capitalist economy). Mutualism and AIA take place in and around the possession form of ownership, where whoever has something in his hands owns it. This is also socialist - only exclusive ownership, where someone in New York can own an Angolan goldmine and can only lose ownership by selling it, excludes any form of socialism. Only in capitalism is ownership such a pivotal factor in society, that is what capitalism is. Under socialism man can not be divorced from his labour, under capitalism his labour can be bought from him. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_Intentions_d6f9.html" title="User:Good Intentions"><b>G</b><small>ood</small><b>I</b><small>ntentions</small></a><sup><a href="../../../g/o/o/User_talk%7EGood_Intentions_ebc9.html" title="User talk:Good Intentions">talk</a></sup> 05:23, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you're referring to Tucker, Spooner, as AIA, then that's not true. They don't support "possession" ownership except for land. Any other means of production is regular ownership, with no requirement than you keep your hands on it. If someone builds a machine or factory, or post office as in Spooner's case, it is his whether he leaves town or not. And Tucker supports purchase and sale of labor. "Not to abolish wages, but to make every man dependent upon wages and secure to every man his whole wages is the aim of Anarchistic Socialism." -Tucker<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 05:31, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You'd do well to consider the context and material circumstances wherein AIA was developed, that of a homesteading and artisan culture. Doing so, you might see the problems with your arguments. BTW, saying "he didn't support 'possession' ownership except for land" is a bit like saying "he didn't support slavery except when using non-Europeans". --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_Intentions_d6f9.html" title="User:Good Intentions"><b>G</b><small>ood</small><b>I</b><small>ntentions</small></a><sup><a href="../../../g/o/o/User_talk%7EGood_Intentions_ebc9.html" title="User talk:Good Intentions">talk</a></sup> 06:29, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"In No 121 of Liberty, criticising an attempt of Kropotkine to identify Communism and Individualism, I charged him with ignoring 'the real question of whether Communism will permit the individual to labor independently, own tools, sell his labor or his products, and buy the labor or products of others.' In Herr Most's eyes this is so outrageous that, in reprinting it, he puts the words "the labor of others" in large black type. Most being a Communist, he must, to be consistent, object to the purchase and sale of anything whatever but why he should particularly object to the purchase and sale of labor is more than I can understand. Really, in the last analysis, labor is the only thing that has any title to be bought or sold. Is there any just basis of price except cost? And is there anything that costs except labor or suffering (another name for labor)? Labor should be paid!

<dd>No, because Tucker stipulated a wage that is materially equivalent to working on MoP that the worker himself owns. Any other wage would be exploitative.

<dd>Tucker did not oppose people working on the means of production owned by others. That was permissible, and he didn't see anything wrong with it.

<dd>You need to reread Tucker. For Tucker, much was <i>permissible</i> which he nonetheless <i>opposed</i>, because Tucker was so opposed to imposing standards. Later in his life, when it became clear to him that simply removing bars to voluntary trade might not overcome artificially concentrated capital and its social power, he became discouraged. But, when it comes to <i>goals</i> and <i>ideals</i>, recall that Tucker's defense of wages was not a defense of the power of employer over employee. He wanted <i>everyone</i> equally at risk in the marketplace. This is, I think, one of those places where capitalists and traditional anarchists (including the American individualists and mutualists) part company. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 19:04, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Does anyone else have problems with the "capitalism" para in the issues section? It is suprisingly less informative and shorter than the "communism" para in the issues section, despite the fact that far more anarchists have fundamental qualms regarding capitalism as opposed to communism. the paragraph is primarily devoted to explaining aspects of capitalism that mutualists and indivdualists don't have a problem with. it currently reads:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Most anarchists traditions not only seek rejection of the state, but also seek rejection of capitalism, which they perceive as authoritarian, coercive, and exploitative. For mutualists, this opposition does not include opposition to the product of labor or capital goods ("means of production") run by individuals, but only "usary," i.e. rent, interest, and profit from other's labor. Thus individualist anarchists, even those who are not anarcho-capitalist, support individual sovereignty, free trade, free competition, and private property, like in mutualism and homesteading.[31][66]</b></dd>

<dd>I note Mr AnCap is even disputing the definition of profit, calling it Marxist. To say that labour is <i>only</i> worth what people are willing to pay for it is capitalist and thus POV.

<dd>I have a problem with saying they oppose "profit from other's labor" without explaining that. "Profit" is not used in the normal sense. "Profit" according to the way mutualist uses it refers to not paying someone according to the labor theory of value. For example, you can "profit" by not paying someone enough for mowing your yard (with "enough" being what the labor theory of value prescribes). The labor theory of value is outmoded and few recognize that definition of profit except Marxists. So, it needs to be explained.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 16:31, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's only <i>out-moded</i> to those who reject socialism, people like yourself. It's a fundamental part of union negotiations the world over. As every kind of anarchist other than your oxymoronic so-called anarchism is socialist, you are pushing your POV on this article. So please quit. Anarchists oppose profiting from another's labour.

<dd>If you make an encylcopedia article you need to write it so at least most people understand it. In mainstream thought it's not even a coherent question of whether you are "profitting from another's labor." You don't profit at all when you pay someone for their labor. You just pay for it. There is no supposed objective value that if it's not matched then anything below it is profit to the person paying for the labor, except according to Marxist-like theory. That is not how "profit" is defined today by the average person. Why do you have a problem with explaining what it means?<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 16:43, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You profit from someone's labour when you make more out of it than they do. If I give the man on my right £10 for something he's made and sell it to the person on my left for £15, that's profiting from another's labour. It's the only definition I've ever heard and I'm not a Marxist. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonnachadelong_ddd0.html" title="User:Donnachadelong">Donnacha</a> 16:48, 4 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's the normal definition of profit that you just gave. But that's not how mutualists are defining profit. Mutualists think that there is some objectively correct price for labor and that if you pay less than that then you're "profiting" or committing "usury." If the labor theory of value says the guy mowing your yard should get $20 for it, but you give him $15 then you have profitted, according to their definition. They thought you would have "stolen" 1/4 of his labor from him. Marxists understand this has having to do with "surplus value." The one who is paying labor is taking the "surplus value."<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 16:51, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Writers who for years have been publishing essays that sound like position papers for vast social movements that do not in fact exist seem seized with confusion or worse, dismissive contempt, now that real ones are everywhere emerging. It’s particularly scandalous in the case of what’s still, for no particularly good reason, referred to as the ‘anti-globalization’ movement, one that has in a mere two or three years managed to transform completely the sense of historical possibilities for millions across the planet.</dd>
<dd>... most of the creative energy for radical politics is now coming from anarchism ...</dd>
<dd>The very notion of direct action, with its rejection of a politics which appeals to governments to modify their behaviour, in favour of physical intervention against state power in a form that itself prefigures an alternative—all of this emerges directly from the libertarian tradition. Anarchism is the heart of the movement, its soul; the source of most of what’s new and hopeful about it....</dd>
<dd>However you choose to trace their origins, these new tactics are perfectly in accord with the general anarchistic inspiration of the movement.</dd>

Christian anarchism is fine, problems only come about when religious people seek to turn the state to their purpose. Even monarchism would be fine in an anarchist system, if a group of people voluntarily decided to elect a king - no problem, as long as they were free to unelect the king if they so wished, or individuals were free to leave the <i>monarchy</i> and he didn't attempt to expand his granted authority beyond the group that elected him. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonnachadelong_ddd0.html" title="User:Donnachadelong">Donnacha</a> 23:35, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

They were pretty much destroyed by force. That's when people like Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman were jailed and thrown out of the country. So the working class, left libertarian movement was mostly smashed but the right libertarian movement was applauded...Lots of anarchists are much confused by this.

He says "the only journals I could write in were ultra-right libertarian journals because we agree on a lot of things." The journals he's talking about are Rothbard's journals. He says that explicitly in another quote: "I should add, however, that I find myself in substantial agreement with people who consider themselves anarcho-capitalists on a whole range of issues; and for some years, was able to write only in their journals." -Answers from Chomsky to Eight Questions on anarchism<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 20:05, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>"Now there is another strain of anarchism which is concerned only with, which really gives no weight to notions like equality, solidarity, and so on. That's the right-wing anarchism...It's perfectly obvious that under the formulations of someone like, say, Murray Rothbard, you will get such inequalites of power that it would be like living under Genghis Khan or something like that." -Chomsky, Language and Politics, page 153<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 20:10, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ancap, that is simple misunderstanding. i too have read that book, though my mom still has it&#160;:). He is talking about the fact that left anarchism was forcibly destroyed in the early 20th century while right anarchism survived government persecution (likely because they had no actual ground movement and were not hostile to capitalism). Social anarchism began to develop strongly in the US again in the sixties and seventies and grew exponentially in the eighties and nineties. that is the history of social anarchism in the US as i have read it in half a dozen books. i would provide quotes but i read those works while in college and so don't have access to most of them. others here should be able to though. Chomsky would not deny the existence of social anarchism today because it is fairly visible, more so at least than ancap. <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlockader_5d3e.html" title="User:Blockader">Blockader</a> 20:03, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think so. He says right-anarchism is the most visible in the Libertarian Party. "One dream of anarchism -and the only kind the survived- was ultra-right anarchism, which you see in the libertarian party, which is just loved by the big corporations and the investment firms and so on.

<dd>Bullshit, that is only one example. Most anarchists I know are either ancom or ansynd. The IWW is influential in many parts of this country and while not explicitly ansynd, is primarily composed of them. ansynd is hardly the smallest school, i would give that distinction to indivualists(i dont mean ancaps) and mutualists(though according to Libertatia mutualism is experiancing a resurgence.) the section on ansynd already notes, "Although more frequently associated with labor struggles of the the early twentieth century (particularly in France and Spain) there are many syndicalist organisations active today." it says that it is "more frequently associated with labor struggles of the the early twentieth century." What do you gain by stating that it is anachronistic? Making one form of anarchism seem less powerful does not increase the power of another form.

<dd>Please, taking one example and attacking it rather than approaching the argument from a wider stance is hardly good pracice. i was merely stating that i at least know many ansynds and therefore have a hard time accepting a single source that questions their existence. you, on the other hand, made a broad assertion that ansynd doesn't have "pan-global, with multi-lingual support." Well the IWA and IWW are primarily western, english speaking groups and the CGT and CNT are French and Spanish and there are scandinavian, south american, russian, etc ansynd groups. thats pretty pan global and multi-lingual. more so i suspect than your beloved anarcho-capitalism. <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlockader_5d3e.html" title="User:Blockader">Blockader</a> 21:50, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>CNT membership lists are not public, but you can see from this [<a href="http://www.cnt.es/Director/index.htm|" class="external text" title="http://www.cnt.es/Director/index.htm|" rel="nofollow">directory</a>] the CNT has locals in 46 towns across Spain. All, or almost all, of these have permanent offices/meeting spaces/libraries. CNT locals are generally staffed and open to the public 4 or more days a week. I don't know much about CGT but by all accounts it has more members than the CNT - its [<a href="http://www.cgt.es/modules.php?name=Directorio&amp;op=list_content&amp;did=3|" class="external text" title="http://www.cgt.es/modules.php?name=Directorio&amp;op=list_content&amp;did=3|" rel="nofollow">directory</a>] lists local federations in more than 80 towns. Spain is a smaller country than the US, obviously, and Spanish anarchism is obviously not what it was in days gone by. It certainly does not have 'large scale endorsement' from the Spanish working class (though you could say it has a higher profile, Spanish people at least tend to know more what anarchism is about). Even so I would think there are more anarcho-syndicalist activists, groups, meeting places, libraries, bookshops, printers, schools, research institutes, social centres etc. in this one little country than there are anarcho-capitalist outfits in the US. Going by weight of numbers and strength of organisation, or indeed intellectual output, this page should focus a lot more on Spain and other Latin-speaking countries and a lot less on the US.<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBengalski_c6f3.html" title="User:Bengalski">Bengalski</a> 17:25, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Here we have a so-called "anarchist" who spouts Stalinist propaganda. Whatever next? Anarchism was a mass movement in Spain, during a war and a revolution. Yes, confiscation of property and resources was done by communities and collectives. Yes, there were executions of traitors. It was war. And, as for teaming with the fascists, that is a disgusting lie and you should be ashamed of yourself. Really, pissing on the memory of people who gave their lives in the thousands to stop fascism and were betrayed by Stalin's followers and the capitalists in France and England who preferred to let Franco win rather than send weapons to the anarchists and POUM on the frontline against fascism.

Anarchism is not about individuals, it's about ideas and movements.

<p>I was wondering if anyone thinks it might be useful to have a de-facto steering committee for this article, with perhaps communications on an external message board for clarity and ease of use. The number for the committee would be small, perhaps between 5-8 members. There might be a president pro tem of some sort, to break tie votes. I'm placing this idea for comments and suggestions by others, to see if anyone else believes this would be a reasonable solution to article's issues, and to fully flesh out how it would work if others are in agreement. Perhaps the committee could focus on one piece or paragraph of the article at a time, and go through the entire article in such a manner to ensure that everything is covered and people aren't dragged off topic, delaying or inhibiting article work. - <a href="../../../m/s/t/User%7EMSTCrow_5721.html" title="User:MSTCrow">MSTCrow</a> 21:01, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Now there is another STRAIN OF ANARCHISM which is concerned only with, which really gives no weight to notions like equality, solidarity, and so on. That's the RIGHT-WING ANARCHISM and that's an extreme form of authoritarianism as far as I can see. It's perfectly obvious that under the formulations of someone like, say, Murray Rothbard, you will get such inequalities of power that it would be like living under Ghengis Khan or sometrhing like that." -Chomsy interviewed in "Language and Politics" by Carlos-Peregrin and Noam Chomsy, page 153 (my emphasis)</p>
<p>"That's a peculiarly Anglo-Saxon phenomenon, in the English speaking world and the United States. One dream of anarchism - and the only kind that survived [in the U.S.] - was ULTRA-RIGHT ANARCHISM...For years, the only journals I could write in were ultra-right libertarian journals because we agree on a lot of things...There was a left anarchist movement, too -the working class movement. They were pretty much destroyed by force. That's when people like Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman were jailed and thrown out of the country. So the working class, LEFT LIBERTARIAN movement was mostly smashed but the RIGHT LIBERTARIAN movement was applauded...Lots of anarchists are much confused by this. The United States has a tradition of individualist anarchism." -Noam Chomsky, in Chomsky on Anarchism, page 215 (my emphasis).</p>

The second question and response are of interest. Chomsky says "The individualistic anarchism that you are talking about, Stirner and others, is one of the roots of -- among other things -- the so-called “libertarian” movement in the US. This means dedication to free market capitalism, and has no connection with the rest of the international anarchist movement. [...]But US and to some extent British libertarianism is quite a different thing and different development, in fact has no objection to tyranny as long as it is private tyranny. That is radically different from other forms of anarchism." Basically, it sounds like he considers it anarchism to some extent, but doesn't particularly like it and says it's not connected with traditional anarchism. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><b><font color="black">Ungovernable Force</font></b></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_6a81.html" title="User talk:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="green"><sup>Got something to say?</sup></font></a> 05:29, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Issue does not mean bone of contention, race and gender are also under issues. As for the terms, globalization is far from anarchist language, it's the term used by its proponents. Anti-globalization, on the other hand, is a dispute term (applied by the critics of the movement more than its proponents), which is why it's preceded by the "so-called". As for neoliberal, it originally said capitalist until one of the ancaps changed it to neoliberal. That's not an anarchist term, per se, it's a Latin American term used by Bolivarians as much as Zapatista followers.

<p>Outside of academic discussions, web warriors and circle-jerks, does "anarcho"-capitalism exist at all in the real world?

<dd>It was a straight-forward question as an alternative to the sectarian nonsense posted above by Ancaps. Anarchism exists on a small scale in squats, in some co-operatives, in non-hierarchical organisations, in mutual aid associations, in democratic trade unions, for a short time in protests, in TAZs. The seeds of the future are being planted now and have born short-lived fruit before, from the Ukraine to Catalonia, from Israel to Korea. These all existed openly and consciously under the banner of anarchism. It's a living, breathing tradition with a powerful and meaningful history. So, I return to my question, does "anarcho"-capitalism have anything to compare? Where are the self-identifying "anarcho"-capitalists other than in right-wing university courses and on the web. I'm honestly asking, because I've seen no evidence of anything more than that. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonnachadelong_ddd0.html" title="User:Donnachadelong">Donnacha</a> 13:11, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Some don't think he's a real anarchist.

<dd>"In particular, we may cite three philosophical precursors of Anarchism, Godwin, Proudhon and perhaps Hegel. None of these was in fact an Anarchist though Proudhon first used the word in its modern sense (taking it from the French Revolution, when it was first used politically and not entirely pejoratively). None of them engaged in Anarchist activity or struggle, indeed Proudhon engaged in parliamentary activity." <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Meltzer_ab3c.html" title="Albert Meltzer">Albert Meltzer</a>, Anarchism: Arguments for and Against, page 12 (same guy who is used as a source in this article for ancap not being anarchism).<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 01:23, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In this case, Meltzer is illogical, anachronistic, and partisan. This is the sort of argument engaged in by all factions who want to inherit anarchism from Proudhon, but at the same time to claim that only <i>they</i> are really anarchists. Proudhon was, in fact, a revolutionary, but the revolution of 1848 was not quite the revolution that he was looking for. He was elected, as an opponent of the Provisional Government, in a by-election, and his proposals during the short time he served were <i>mainly</i> of a fairly libertarian character. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 02:25, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Meltzer's claim is obviously far outside the mainstream. His support for it involves an obviously non-standard use of the term <i>anarchism</i>. His definition is barely useful, because it is circular: anarchists do anarchist stuff, and organize with other anarchists. It's as if nobody could be an anarchist until there was some sort of mass movement, and a dogma agreed upon. It's weak and unhelpful stuff, the inclusion of which will force us to deal with even more weak and unhelpful material. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 16:53, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

One of the dubious <i>beauties</i> of Wikipedia is that it is <i>always</i> possible to game an article into nonsense.

<p>Why was Hogeye banned from Wikipedia for forking anarchism into two complimentary articles, one for each side, which was the best chance of resolving the issues with the anarchism article, while a completely POV fork that only causes more disruption was allowed for a <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_and_anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism">Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism</a> article that only exists to bash anarcho-capitalism?</p>
<p>I'm severely disappointed in you, Donnacha, as well. I thought you were genuinely trying to resolve things, but instead I learn you've been lobbying to keep your own POV fork, making the situation worse. You've made it clear that you don't care about the other side having a say from your comments there, when the other side has gone out of its way to let the anarcho-collectivists speak their mind. From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Anarchism_and_anarcho-capitalism" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Anarchism_and_anarcho-capitalism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Anarchism_and_anarcho-capitalism</a>, it can be seen that most of the other anarcho-collectivists have also been working in bad faith. You've broken our trust, and I don't think that there's any hope as long as we have duplicity running rampant among one side of the negotiating table. - <a href="../../../m/s/t/User%7EMSTCrow_5721.html" title="User:MSTCrow">MSTCrow</a> 01:14, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>(1) Hogeye was banned because he exhausted the community's patience. The forking was just the final straw. (2) That article is not meant for "bashing anarcho-capitalism." --AaronS 01:28, 6 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That ariticle was definitely meant for bashing anarcho-capitalism. It's obvious to anyone who reads through all that nonsense. It's people attacking anarcho-capitalism and others defending it against the attacks. Just the title "Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism" carries with it the assumption that Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism are two different things.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 01:34, 6 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It looks different if you've been involved in these online debates for a decade or more. The anarchist vs an-cap debate has simply been a real and observable phenomenon for years and years now. Documents such as <i>An Anarchist FAQ</i> resulted from it. Certain left-right anarchist collaborations have grown out of it. Wikipedia is shaped by it every day. As recently as the last deletion vote, there seemed to be a different sense of what the article was good for. If there is no longer that sense, then the vote will undoubtedly lead to its deletion. But this whole talk section is an exercise in assuming bad faith, which is a little <i>ugly</i>, considering the charge is deviation from Wikipedia rules. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 02:31, 6 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am very close to requesting arbitration on this article. What you people seem to need is an admin who has powers like the ones that the admins on <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neuro-linguistic_programming.html" title="Neuro-linguistic programming">Neuro-linguistic programming</a> had for awhile. And that was per an arbcom decision. MSTCrow, have you looked at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Hogeye" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Hogeye" rel="nofollow">Hogeye's block list</a>? If that doesn't define "exhausting community's patience", nothing does. As for <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_and_anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism">Anarchism_and_anarcho-capitalism</a>, it's been around for a year and a half and even if it is a POV fork, it's not nearly as clear-cut as Hogeye's was. And Hogeye actually edited that article a few times over the last couple of weeks. This feels like "tit for tat". "Well you guys had a problem with these forks, so let's bring up what we consider forks". It just isn't as clear cut with Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism as it was with Hogeye's forks. Hogeye was clearly trying to get around protection by creating those forks. Unless I'm missing something, I don't think that was the intention of the Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism article. It'd be terrific if you people would quit the constant brow beating and actually work on trying to come up with a compromise. I can see why you've exhausted several admins. I'm getting close to joining the list. Bicker bicker bicker. That's all you people seem to do. And outside of blocking everyone, I don't see an end to it outside of something drastic like an arbcom mandate. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">(meow)</a></sup> 03:15, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I have worked at compromise since I arrived at this talk page, but it is clear that several of the parties have no desire at a resolution. They veto, but never offer any solutions.

<dd>I'd disagree only with the concept that there are two sides pushing their POV. Virtually everyone on the left here wants correct and unbiased reflection of the facts. None of the main editors want "anarcho"-capitalism removed, we just want proper reflection of anarchism worldwide without <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html#Undue_weight" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Undue weight</a>. "Anarcho"-capitalism is a minority position, regarded as an oxymoron by most anarchists. That is a salient point and the "anarcho"-capitalist view on most issues is irrelevant due to its minority position. Thus, the involvement of anarchists in the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-globalisation.html" title="Anti-globalisation">anti-globalisation</a> movement is important, the minority opposition to that of "anarcho"-capitalists is not relevant to the topic. And the dispute between the historically-rooted active movement of anarchism worldwide and the minority dictionary definition of the "anarcho"-capitalists is worthy of a full explanation, in its own article, as long as "anarcho"-capitalism remains a disputed minority view. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonnachadelong_ddd0.html" title="User:Donnachadelong">Donnacha</a> 13:25, 6 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I might disagree with that, too. Some editors who have since been banned have preferred to wrap this situation up in "side versus side" rhetoric (notably, "communists versus capitalists," "anarcho-communists versus anarcho-capitalists," "collectivists versus individualists," etc.). That's a misrepresentation. The point of contention has never been whether or not anarcho-capitalism <i>should</i> be treated; it has always been around <i>how</i> it should be treated. Further, many of the edit wars have been the result of now-banned editors attempting to give anarcho-capitalism a "pedigree" of sorts. Anarcho-capitalism exists as a philosophy created by an economist in the 1950s that never became very popular. It is not some grand movement that began in the 18th century and saw its culmination in a massive revolution of thought in the 20th century. Empirically, anarcho-capitalism's existence is proven only by a few university professors and some scattered web sites. It deserves a place in this article, but this article must not be a soap box (the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalism</a> article already is).</dd>
<dd>That's all I have to say. I've really lost interest in this. --AaronS 18:17, 6 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's not true. Anarcho-capitalism is very popular, at least in the United States. Some anarcho-communists are trying to push a myth that it's something obscure but it's not. As far as "pedigree" goes, I don't even see that as an issue. I'm on anarcho-capitalist and I don't need a pedigree. I'm a self-creation who came up with my own anarcho-capitalism before I ever heard of anyone else's and without ever having heard of Murray Rothbard, without consulting past anarchists. I don't need a pedigree to be an anarchist. Individualist anarchism is the logical conclusion of classical liberalism. People who believes in private property and as little government as possible - that government is a "necessary evil" - simply take themselves to the next level. If you come from a collectivist background, you're probably not going to arrive at anarcho-capitalism as a natural evolution of thought but would have to step outside the box so to speak. The number of anarcho-capitalists is no doubt huge in the U.S. They just don't don't engage in mass demonstrations and set off bombs.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 18:28, 6 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You say that as if I am not also from the United States, and need a lesson in what is popular here. I am, and I don't. The only place that I have ever encountered anarcho-capitalism is on the Internet, and especially here on Wikipedia. Not in my town that I'm from, not in the cities that I've lived in, not in the many states that I've visited, not in the news that I've read, not in the books that I've read, not in my college courses, and not in my college materials. That's why RJII's missions was to "correct" all of this "repression." Sorry, but I don't buy it. --AaronS 19:43, 6 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's not my point. My point was that if you had a classical liberal (laissez-faire liberalism) background that is native to the U.S. you would have come up with anarcho-capitalism on your own simply by taking it to its logical extreme. If you were raised by a family of welfare statists you would probably have to discover it in books or on the internet, because it would be alien to your train of thought.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 20:18, 6 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Anarchism of any variety is outside the political mainstream in the United States (and pretty much every other country, except maybe <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somalia.html" title="Somalia">Somalia</a>), where moderate statism is the "mainstream" position, with lots of bickering about whether it should be moderately left-wing or moderately right-wing statism, and with politicians who basically try to enrich themselves and pander to special interests regardless of their stated ideology. However, I believe capitalist libertarianism, including its extreme "purist" form of anarcho-capitalism, to at least resonate better with the prevailing dominant beliefs of Americans than socialism (including its extreme form of anarcho-communism). <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan T.*</a> 04:28, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>youre all talking like you know everything going on in the US, which is why you can say this or this is or is not popular, but thats just alot of bullshit! Ive seen an discussion degerenating into this over and over again. Whats the matter with you people? It not about who started all this, but also who went along the same discourse of discussion. When ANYBODY say something like: "I know something to be unpopular" it shouldnt be about anything else than saying: "You simply dont know". So my point here is: lets talk in wikipedia terms of verifiability instead of truth, because the truth is not our concern here! Dont jump on the wagon saying: "I know what you think is unpopular is really popular" or the other way around.
