<p>I have done some contribs in past, and expected all to be auto transfered here that was under my IP address, as seemed to be suggested by the page that was set up for user and then it gave my Ip address and my old user name. I am involved in various researches and one gal had mentioned to me that she would like to have a subject included, so I submitted an article and some urls for reference anon. It was called "Jim the Wonder Dog". And she has been bugging me about whether it was going to be in Wikipedia or not. So I have signed up under a new user name, as an earlier user name was primarily used for one avenue and did not wish that user name showing up in Google searches. It's been a while and I never really gave wikipedia that much time, but imagine since it is showing my new user name AnalogHuman, then untill I am sure that all this is permanantly erasable, I won't write my IP here, but hoped I could get all under one roof and then have a response for her about that article.Imagine me doing that article for her and I hardly know how to navigate this place myself, it was an odd topic, but have done a number of news article for news services and written research proposals before for other's so it was no big deal. If this is erasable,(seems it was). I can supply my IP if it is not easily found by you. Guess that's enough to consider for now.Thanks,</p>

<dd>There was indeed a page for a short time at Jim the Wonder Dog, however it was deleted as <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#G1" title="WP:CSD">nonsensical</a>. You can <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=Jim_the_Wonder_Dog" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=Jim_the_Wonder_Dog" rel="nofollow">view the deletion log</a> for that article, but I can tell you that it was not created by an IP user (rather another user under a different name, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Peanutashbourne_32ea.html" title="Special:Contributions/Peanutashbourne">Peanutashbourne</a>). Was that your former username that you're trying to recover the edits for? If so, I don't believe they do that anymore except in extreme cases; if you cannot recover the password to that old account, I suggest just starting over, and perhaps making a note of what your former name used to be. With less than 50 edits under that old name, it's unlikely to affect anyone's opinion of you strongly. Hope that helped. -- <i><a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae</a>'<a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">blis</a></i> 06:02, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Don't think that was the same article as I had edited one letter on the submission as recent as this month, as I was checking on it. I see this link at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_creation%2F2006-09-20&amp;diff=93492749&amp;oldid=89628374" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_creation%2F2006-09-20&amp;diff=93492749&amp;oldid=89628374" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and it does show my ip address as part of the submission.It is also on page; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_creation/2006-09-20" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_creation/2006-09-20" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> as submission 117, however the topic is rather odd admitedly, and would not be surprised by the review of nonsensical, except for the facts that several books have been written about the dog and one movie was made and an old tv special and now they are considering making another movie, so it seemed worthy under those circumstances or I wouldn't have bothered writing up the article as it does not seem possible, but there are plenty of things mentioned in wikipedia such as the loch ness monster that seem unbelievable but have drawn enough popular culture attention that they are worthy.

<dd>Ahhh, I think I understand now. I didn't see that request for article creation before; the sources look marginally okay, and whoever created that article stub doesn't seem to have had the same knowledge of the subject that you do. If I restore a very brief version of that page, do you think you'd be able to incorporate the sources you have available to you (mostly meaning published books and websites, not local recollections, unless they've been published somewhere) into a new article? The subject sounds interesting, and something I hadn't heard of before. Let me know if I can be of any further help. -- <i><a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae</a>'<a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">blis</a></i> 14:19, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>P.S. I noticed you keep blanking the page - was that to remove the 'request for help' template? If so, I've taken it off now, and you won't show up on that list asking for help anymore... if you're giving up or having some other technical difficulty, just let me know (even by email, if necessary - you can find a link on <a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">my userpage</a>). -- <i><a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae</a>'<a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">blis</a></i> 14:19, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So if I'm reading from what you have said before, your trouble with logins is that your IP address is showing up all the time? And when you try to edit your own "talk page," you are warned with vandalism? I don't know what to say, other than trying to tell other Admins like <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobak_55e4.html" title="User:Bobak">User:Bobak</a> or someone else you know that is an Admin. <a href="../../../s/p/e/User%7ESpecter01010_95bd.html" title="User:Specter01010">Specter01010</a> 02:42, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
