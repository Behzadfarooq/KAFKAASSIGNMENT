<dl>
<dd>It doesn't help that you removed it before even waiting for a reply. Anyway, this is no longer a spoiler. Almost every piece of advertisement and official stuff from Lucasarts gave away the secret and the secret has become part of popular culture. Either way, Wikipedia does not omit spoilers. His fall is an integral part of his character. I would suggest moving the spoiler tag up but even that seems gratuitous. <a href="../../../g/d/o/User%7EGdo01_992f.html" title="User:Gdo01">Gdo01</a> 04:22, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I noticed there is only one article for the American Taliban, "John Walker Lindh". However, John Walker Lindh was a young American boy. The person who was found in Afghanistan was called "Suleyman al-Faris" - the name he adopted when he changed his beliefs. Why is there not a separate article for this name? Gone John Lindh is, consumed by Suleyman al-Faris.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and there should be separate articles for "Joseph Alois Ratzinger" and "Pope Benedict XVI" as well. "Pope", like "Darth" is a title, and "Benedict" is a different name than "Ratzinger", just like "Vader" is a different name than "Skywalker".</p>
<p>Don't forget to split Pee Wee Herman and Paul Rubens up too.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Don't forget to keep in mind that most of the world doesn't know that Anakin and Darth are one and the same / have the same origin. For spoiler reasons alone there should be two articles. I live in Korea and watched Star Wars with a girl I know who had never seen it before, from Episode I. Let's say she came home after episode I or II and looked up Anakin Skywalker and was directed to Darth Vader. That would be irresponsible. Having two articles lets people like that look up a bit of info on Anakin for example (maybe up to Episode I or II if they forgot something from the movie and wanted to check before seeing Episode III) without knowing the whole story. <a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMithridates_47c8.html" title="User:Mithridates">Mithridates</a> 12:58, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fair enough, since the no-spoiler or spoiler-warning thing seems to be part of Wikipedia's policy. Having said that, I think the entire policy is a little strange. If I hadn't seen a movie, the last thing I would do is look up specific people, places, and things about it in an encyclopedia. I was *assume* an encyclopedia would tell me things about the plot, including spoilers. But that's a long debate I won't worry about. I should note, however, that there is no separate article for Darth Tyrannous, and it even gives this as Dooku's name BEFORE the spoiler warning. If you'll recall Episode II, we learn that Fett was recruited by a man named Tyrannus early on. Then we're later introduced to Count Dooku. Only at the end of the film is Dooku called Darth Tyrannus by Sidious. And Sidious may have a seperate entry, but it's extremely weak. Not only that, but looking up Palpatine you get a pic of Sidious, making it obvious who will be whom. If one were to watch 1-6 in order, knowing nothing else, it wouldn't be obvious until Episode III that Palpatine is Sideous OR that he becomes an Emperor (since you wouldn't know the Republic was going to become an empire).</dd>

</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I notice there is no separate articles for Keyser Soze and his other identity either. In that case you have one entry, but suppose someone wanted to look up the other name? There's no article for it and there should be. Perhaps there should be an official Wikipedia rule saying "there should always be multiple entries for the same character going by different names when it is a matter of being a spoiler." so this is all more consistent.</dd>

<p>I've made this a short article with a spoiler warning and a link at the end explaining that a full article is at <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darth_Vader_35c8.html" title="Darth Vader">Darth Vader</a>. Since we have a merged article, a simple redirect would be a spoiler, so I've gone ahead and copy-and-pasted some of the Anakin Skywalker content from that article with an italicized explanation at the bottom. — <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b> <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a></i> 02:20, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>If you want this to be a simple redirect, please justify that and explain how that can be done without spoilers. — <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b> <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a></i> 19:52, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, <i>which</i> movie it's a spoiler to depends on whether one watches them in the order originally released, or in the order suggested by the episode numbers. By original release, <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i> is the one that's "spoiled", but by episode number, the relevant fact is revealed in <i>Episode III: The Revenge of the Sith</i>. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan*</a> 19:44, Jun 24, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Indeed. Still, it is a spoiler either way. Does this article seem biased as to which way, and if so is that a problem? — <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b> <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a></i> 19:50, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article is more of a glorified redirect than anything. I don't want to fork the <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darth_Vader_35c8.html" title="Darth Vader">Darth Vader</a> article so I'm keeping this as short as possible to ensure that editors get the point that this isn't supposed to be an article in itself. So four sentences of content and two self-referential sentences. That's it. — <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b> <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a></i> 03:36, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>By saying the following lines: "Since Darth Vader and Anakin Skywalker are the same character, they are covered in the same article, titled Darth Vader. This short article exists because a redirect would have revealed, without warning, Vader's original identity."</p>
<p>are you not revealing the fact that Anakin and Vader are the same person, why not have information about Anakin from Episodes 1,2,3(until he is dubed Darth Vader) and 6 (after he is Anakin at the end)on this page, and info on Vader on his own page, even the movies say Anakin "Died" and Darth Vader was born: in Wikiquotes you have the line Yoda tells Obi "Twisted by the Dark Side, young Skywalker has become … The boy you trained, <b>gone he is, consumed by Darth Vader</b>."</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's largely a question of point of view when he is Vader and when he is Skywalker, and when he is both. (Throughout all of Episode III, at least until he's encased in the suit, he seems to go by both identities.) It's just better to have a merged article, and having it at the most common name for the character "Darth Vader" instead of perhaps the most appropriate, is the policy. The article does reveal his identity, but at the same time it also has a warning beforehand, something that would be impossible with a redirect. (Someone types in "Anakin Skywalker" and ends up at Darth Vader). So the soft redirect is the best decision here. — <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b> <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a></i> 21:19, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>

<p>Yes but the "certain point of view" is that of George Lucas, and his point of view over the Star Wars universe is law, should we not follow his feelings about Anakin and Vader being two people. go to the star wars: databank, on the Starwars.com web site it states:</p>
<p>"As turmoil engulfed the galaxy during the transition from Republic to Empire, Anakin fell to the dark side of the Force. <b>Consumed by evil, Anakin abandoned his past and his humanity</b>. He became Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith, apprentice to the evil Emperor Palpatine."</p>
<p>it also lists Anakin being in Episodes 1,2,3,and 6, if Lucas wanted them to be one person then it would have said Episodes 1,2,3,4,5,6</p>
<p>under the Darth Vader link on the Starwars.com site it clearly states:</p>
<p>" Anakin was grievously wounded in the fight. His burning anger kept him alive, and he was forever scarred not only by his wounds but also by betrayal. He abandoned his former identity. When metal coupled with flesh in the form of cyborg implants and enhancements required to sustain him, <b>Skywalker's transformation was complete. He was no longer Anakin. He was Darth Vader."</b></p>
<p>it also lists Vader being in Episodes 4,5,and 6, if Lucas wanted them to be one person then Vader would be called Anakin Skywalker in 4,5,6 not Darth Vader.</p>
<p>Plus you "Philwelch" stated my point about Anakin and Vader under the Vader talk section:</p>
<pre>
 Your Words about the Bio box for Vader/Anakin to be separate: 
    "Enough of the information changes during the transition from Anakin to Vader that having 
</pre>
<p>two separate boxes makes sense. The story seems to make a big point of <b>the two being two different sides, two different personas</b> inside the same person, so I think the separation makes sense."</p>
<p>the two being two different sides, two different personas sounds like two different minds in one body so Anakin should be listed as a separate person&#160;!!!!!!</p>

<p>It's the point of view of Obi-Wan, but not quite the point of view of Luke. This decision was made a LONG time ago. One person who changes his name when he's in his mid-20's does not make for two people. — <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b> <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a></i> 20:22, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

It's the point of view of George Lucas, not of two fake people (Obi-Wan &amp; Luke)or the actors that played them, true about changing ones name does not make for two people but it was more then a name change for Anakin Skywalker he lost 80% of his body and GAVE UP HIS LIFE AS ANAKIN.</p>

<dd>DivineLady, Wookieepedian, and igordebraga have all specifically stopped by to compliment the pages on their new format thanks to the change, and I think it's a vast improvement too. You're the only person who seems to oppose it at this point in the discussion, so while I fully agree that we should, I think your revert was a tad premature; we can always revert it later, if a consensus <i>does</i> arise to keep the previous version, rather than just one person's opinion (which is not to say that it's a <i>bad</i> opinion, but I think we should give the new format a bit of a chance so more people can see the new proposed style and thus more people will come to visit the Talk page and discuss this; if we leave it as-is, fewer people will be aware of this debate and come to voice their opinion on it, both potential supporters of your version and of mine), so I don't think we should be in such a hurry to revert <i>all</i> of the changes, a large number of which were clear improvements even if you disagree with the overall layout change..</dd>
<dd>If you disagree very strongly, I'll go and find another alternative to having the page buried in the edit history or having it on the main page, since I don't want this to turn into an edit war, but if you can stand having the page in a way you don't like it for at least just a day or two while we discuss this, I think that would be for the best. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 22:50, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One of the interesting ideas brought up in episode iii was the idea that the sith actually created anakin by manipulating the midi-chorians. Although Palpatine does not state this explicitly in the movie, it was implied even more strongly in earlier drafts, and I recall Lucas or someone saying that he intended to leave the issue unresolved. I have also read that some belive that the sith not only created anakin, but they also created the so-called jedi prophesy to aid their long term goals.

<p>-Somewhere throughout the myriad of the expanded universe i read once that shmi was enslaved upon naboo, and that her owners were in fact the Palpatine Nobelship. It is never stated outright, howvever it is implied that she was the housemaiden of the twenty something dantius Palpatine, aka the emperor. does anyone know where this was????, it was posted on the net somewhere to, albeit for a short while..anybody?</p>
<p>After the now famous subtle dialouge within the private box at the show, when Palpatine talks with Anakin about the many abilities of Darth Plageius the wise, it can be infered that Dantius used these said powers to spark the life of Anakin. Making Anakin Skywalker the force child of Dantius Palpatines focused meditation, as well as all the subsequent lineage; I.E. Luke, Leia, Cade, Ben..etc. etc.</p>

<dd>I'm sorry, but all this stuff about Darth Plageius creating Anakin is pure fan speculation, and nothing more. It's baseless and wild.

<dd>Incorrect. The Force is balanced in and of itself. The Dark Side is a corruption of the Force, an <i>inbalance</i> if you will.

<dd>I agree with, at the very least, drastically shortening the Vader contents of the Anakin article. I agree that it is very redundant.

<dd>I concur. The problem with two articles on is that there are minor differences creeping into each. What we end up with is two slightly different articles on the same subject.

<dd>Correct. This is actually the exact layout that was suggested back when this split was proposed, in order to avoid redundancies.

<dd>Is it possible to retitle this section to avoid having a spoiler in the TOC?

<p>There should really be a talents and a prophecy article, don't you think. I mean he was the most powerful and the Chosen One.

<dd>The prophecy is mentioned in the <i>Episode 1</i> text, with a link to a more detailed discussion about it (although the link was broken; I've since fixed it).

<p>I think the <i>Origin of Anakin Skywalker</i> section from the <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darth_Plagueis_5666.html" title="Darth Plagueis">Darth Plagueis</a> article should be here (afterall, it's about Anakin).

<p>Re: the note on the change of Anakin to Hayden Christensen - I'm not sure if I should be changing the note so I'll leave the note here on the talk page. One issue commonly neglected is that for those who have never seen Star Wars before (here in Korea most haven't, and the majority of the world has never seen them either) the sudden appearance of some old guy near the end of Episode 6 would be confusing after two movies with Christensen as Anakin. I just saw Episodes I through VI with somebody I know here and were the original picture to have been shown it would have just been confusing. There's Yoda, Obi-wan, and...er...some other dude? IOW there was really no choice. This point should be condensed and added to the ref. <a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMithridates_47c8.html" title="User:Mithridates">Mithridates</a> 19:28, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>No, it's not confusing at all. No more so than replacing Ewan McGregor with Alec Guinness halfway through the series. Anyone who can recognize Shaw as Anakin when he dies on the Death Star can also accept him as the ghost later on. Dark Side or no, Anakin's ghost ages the same as any other character, and the Shaw ghost proves it. Reversing aging just so the audience can recognize a younger actor is ludicrous.Kenobifan 14:58, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Listen. I don' know wh you are that emailed me, but the Anakin skywalker page contains incorrect info, I was correcting that and expanding on the page more. I'm Sorry about the image thing, my comp' glitched. But the article needs editing. ~ All That Jazz</p>

<p>It's a very minor thing, but I corrected Anakin's age. As of the beginning of the film version of Attack of the Clones, Anakin was 20 years old, not 19. It's on the Star Wars Databank for Anakin, in the movie novelization, and all other official Lucasfilm information. Attack of the Clones takes place 10 years and a few months after The Phantom Menace. Since Revenge of the Sith takes place 3 years after Attack of the Clones, Anakin is 23 there, not 22. Feel free to check any source; Lucasfilm canon backs me up. - Imadra Blue</p>
