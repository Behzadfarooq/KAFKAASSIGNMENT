<li>I added an infobox on the demographics portion similar to the one on the Ladera Ranch, Mission Viejo, California Community page to the Anaheim Hills page. I did have to modify it because some information that was avalible for Ladera Ranch wasnt avalible for Anaheim Hills and visa versa. I would like to include the map on this infobox versus the way it sits right now because where it is located right now in the page is not where the location is described. I dont know how to add the map to the infobox lower down on the demographics page, but if someone with more knowledge about doing that could assist me I would appreciate it!--<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricsaindon2_e596.html" title="User:Ericsaindon2">Ericsaindon2</a> 01:58, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Straw Poll New and Modified</span></h2>
<p>I have created a whole new infobox totally custom for communities only including things tht communitites have. It does not include all of that governmental information, but rather focuses on the people and characteristics of a community, which can be determined in some communitites in other ways besides through Census. This one provides a whole new look, and disincludes the city seal and city flags. However, it does include features that are more directed to communities, like unofficial boundaries, and people characteristics to replace governmentl statistics that arent avalible for unincorporated areas. I hope it suits the needs, and I think that it will provide a good addition to the page. Also, it will give Wikipedia a heads up when people are researching Anaheim Hills. It is the only place where statitics are avalible for free about Anaheim Hills, since the source of the infomation, DataQuick, costs money to get the privately researched information. It is more necessary on this page than any other city page, because other cities have that information posted all over the internet, and communities dont have it posted anywhere, so why deprive the public of this valuable information when it is avalible, and can be avalible on Wikipedia?</p>

<li><b>Oppose</b>. The information you refer to can be in the article without an infobox (and currently is). The map could be shown on its own. The problem here, which you still aren't realizing, is that DataQuick's data can't be used because we don't know what they're calling "Anaheim Hills". The fact that Anaheim Hills is unofficial is likely the reason that you can't find information on the Internet. Also, you're probably violating the terms of service for your subscription by reposting this data here. Without a <b>reliable</b> source, this information should not be on Wikipedia. Dataquick is not reliable unless we can confirm the scope and applicability of their data. However, even if we can confirm this, they probably aren't appropriate as a source because that means we're basing the very <i>definition</i> of Anaheim Hills on Dataquick, which is not at all a definitive source of such information. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Dillon_27e0.html" title="User talk:Mike Dillon">Mike Dillon</a> 14:57, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Oppose</b> Besides the aesthetic issues with the infobox, I hesitate to install something that would by extension require use on thousands of other articles about neighborhoods. Also, as mentioned by Mike Dillon, the definition of "Anaheim Hills" is uncertain, and so demographics should be approxamated, explained, and analyzed within the text. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">Adambiswanger1</a> 18:47, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Because those pages dont have a split vote on whether to move it or not like this one does. If nobody votes (like what happened on the other pages) then it can be moved, but there is so much controversy on this page that it should remain unaffected until a clear resolution can be come to. If Mike Dillon decides to start an arguement on another page, like he did on this one, then we can change those back too. --70.237.91.134 04:35, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am sure my newest addition, History, has alot of technicalities that can be fixed (spelling, grammar, etc). Feel free to correct it and read over it, because it does have word and structure issues.

<p>I added a picture showing the bulk of my description of Anaheim Hills in 1925. I am not sure how to edit this picture because it is avalible for use in public domain, and the original photographer (now dead) has released all rights to the photo. I think it shows the Anaheim and Anaheim Hills area well. I would also like it if some wordings could be changed in the history part to make it sound more "encyclopedic". I was a bit tired when I wrote it so the right words werent coming to mind. It does seem to need a little bit of help in its editing. Oh, and thank you for putting the picture in the infobox whichever editor did that. It looks really good, and doesnt resemble a city infobox in any way. This page is definately starting to shape up. In regards to the name change, please dont, at least for like another week. THerew are good arguements for both sides, and because of that the vote is split. The support votes do have one more than the oppose votes, but the oppose votes have many more reasons to why it should not be changed than support has provided for why it should be changed (rather than it just should just because it is convention). It includes all of the stuff and information that actual cities do, which is more than any other community page shows. I would arguably agree with a statement I read that Anaheim Hills was one of, if not the best and most comprehensive community articles on Wikipedia. Nearly 85% of all community pages are stubs, and nearly none of them can touch the caliber of the Anaheim Hills page has reached over the past few months. Thanks everyone for making Anaheim Hills a revolutionary approach for all communities in the USA to follow, and making it such a prime example for what works (and what doesnt) when it comes to community pages. This page went from the worst to the best in just a matter of months, and everyone that participated should feel accomplished. --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricsaindon2_e596.html" title="User:Ericsaindon2">Ericsaindon2</a> 06:14, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Return of the Infobox</span></h2>
<p>I noticed that an infobox has reappeared on the page. I'm not sure what changes it reflects to address the concerns by those who opposed in the above polls, but I think out of prudence considering the situation here I think it would be wise if for a little while major changes took place after consensus on the talk page. I realize that maybe I haven't made my concerns clear with why I oppose an infobox so I shall do so as clearly as I can:</p>

<li>The Anaheim Hills boundary is currently described in the article as follows: <i>"Anaheim Hills is comprised of two zip codes, 92807 which serves the western portions of Anaheim Hills, and 92808 which serves the eastern portion of Anaheim Hills. Not all parts of the 92807 zip code are included in Anaheim Hills. Only those residents that live south of the 91 freeway in the 92807 zip code are in the Anaheim Hills vicinity."</i> The infobox cites the population as 53,997. The sources provided give data based on whole zipcodes, but Anaheim Hills is defined on partial zips. How was this (very precise) figure ascertained? By the current definition of Anaheim Hills boundary, I see no viable way of constructing a population figure unless one can be directly provided by some outside statistics agency.</li>
<li>Similarly, after visiting the referenced sites, I couldn't find the data that was used in the infobox for racial percentages. This may have come from the US Census by adding up the zip codes data, but (aside from the fact that Census isn't identified as a source) the inhibitions of partial zip codes creates a problem here too. Additionally, if the data was added up manually per zip code, great care must be taken with the manipulation of percentages because they are relative values, not absolute (I speak from experience).</li>
<li>My argument extends also to the precise values ascertained for land and water area. I didn't see this information from the sources provided.</li>
<li>How was the median home value calculated? If it was averaged from the participating zip codes, then care must have been taken to account for more or fewer homes from one zip code to the next. (in an extreme example, picture two neighboring zipcodes, 11111 and 22222. In 11111 there is a single home and it's worth $1,000,000. In 22222 there are a ten homes all worth $100,000. The average home value for the area is $181,181, not $550,000 which is the plain average of the two zips.) Hopefully I have made it clear why I am so interested in how the data was constructed.</li>
<li>Finally, and this is on a different vein, I think an infobox for Anaheim Hills even with perfectly correct and well sourced data sets an impossible precedent for other communities because counterpart data for other neighborhoods may be incomplete or just unavailable.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think this is worth repeating: let us refrain from infobox adding until a consensus has been reached. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoltras_3970.html" title="User:Soltras">Soltras</a> 06:18, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I totally agree with you. But all this information can be concluded by doing a neighborhood by neighborhood Census addition (a complicated formula) which has been done for us by DataQuick in this case. They considered all the neighborhoods, the number of homes, the area that the homes comprimised, and the number of residents to determine this statistic. Since Census convinently divies their statistics by community and associations on their map portion (not their statistical portion) Anaheim Hills can be added together (since Anaheim Hills comprises certain neighborhoods and not others, which are defined on the Census maps). Now, if you want, I can supply you with the formulas that they used, and you will come up with the same numbers. --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricsaindon2_e596.html" title="User:Ericsaindon2">Ericsaindon2</a> 06:25, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I didn't see DataQuick listed as a source. Please post all your sources. In any case, this still doesn't explain how the infobox cropped back up after it was voted down (twice). <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoltras_3970.html" title="User:Soltras">Soltras</a> 06:33, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have looked at every community page in California, and only about 5 out of 150 have this dumb naming convention. All of them have community, state, or just simply community. I dont know who "made up" this rule from the top of their head, but it doesnt make any sense, and is not a rule ANYWHERE in Wikipedia.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Compromise</span></h2>
<p>In order to promote peace and reconciliation, I propose that we move the article back to "Anaheim Hills, California". Though the practice of naming articles according to the scheme of "neighborhood, city, state" is very common and practical, it is not a policy. On occasion, some editors have objected strenuously to having their neighborhood article named in that way. While consistency is important in an encyclopedia, the exigencies of collaborative editing are such that sometimes it's virtualy necessary for common practice to give way to individual preference.</p>
<p>This case is slightly different than some because many recent edits sought to portray the district incorrectly as an independent place. Those edits sensitized other editors to claims of independence. However I think we've moved past that stage and there is no longer any question that Anaheim Hills is a part of Anaheim. The article now properly reflects that fact in the text.</p>
<p>If moving the article back to just "Anaheim Hills" will bring peace to the article, and if editors can agree to remove contentious boxes, and unverifiable data, then I think it is worth making an exception to normal practice. This is all too minor to fight about. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 09:50, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>All right. I still support the "AH, A, Calif" format, but my main issue has always been with the infobox. It has reappeared this morning. I still do not know where this information comes from. The sources provided do not give this information (that I could see) and at best they give info broken down by zip code - yet Anaheim Hills is defined on partial zip codes. Ericsaindon2 mentioned something about DataQuick, but it's not listed as a source and when I researched it on my own, I couldn't find in the site where to get data for Anaheim Hills. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoltras_3970.html" title="User:Soltras">Soltras</a> 16:23, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I agree with the move, but get all of that protection stuff off the page. It looks like your entering some top secret CIA site, and all it is is an Anaheim Hills information page. I cannot promise that the infobox remain off the page (but we will solve that issue after we solve the naming dispute). I dont seem to understand why, if all the facts were verified, that the box cannot remain on the page? Everything was verified, and has sources, and so what if it is not typical for a page to have an infobox! There is no designated community infobox, so that doesnt mean there cant be, it just means that there isnt at this time. Now, since there isnt, the infobox needs to be determined on a page-by-page basis, and it shouldnt come through a straw poll whether it is there or not, but through practicality and verified information. And the straw polls are ianccurate of original opinions because everyone on this page, besides maybe myself, Serge, Adambswanger1 are all working together and all agree about everything because that is standard for admins to do. They dont want to get into a confrontation or they may loose their adminship, so they dont argue, and since they dont argue, they all just agree with eachother, making the polls worthless of original opinion. Now, I am not the one loosing here, neither are any of you, but its those people who rely on Wikipedia for a good source of information that there should be an infobox on the page. It compresses all the demographic facts, and does not include any of that governmental stuff that real infoboxes for cities do. It has facts that are avalible, but take alot of time for people to calculate neighborhood by neighborhood facts like these are. Now how can you deny these people of these facts just because all you admins are backing eachother up, and not truely letting your real feelings out? I have not heard one good reason why the infobox should not be on the page. There is no confusion of if Anaheim Hills is a city, because the infobox is totally modified to just include facts avalible for the area. Now, on this page especially, an infobox is essential because its the only site on the world wide web where someone actually to took the time to go deep into Cenusus records to determine the Anaheim Hills demographics that are verifiable, but are timely to compress. I think that depriving the page of this beneficial infobox would be depriving the people that rely on this site for information on the things they like to look up. Now the only arguement I have heard was that it was big and clunky! Now, just because it is big and clunky doesnt mean that all people that read this article should not be supplied with the information. They are not going to enter the page, and say that box is clunky, I am leaving. No, they will say wow, someone actually took the time to comprise a bunch of Census data just for this page. Like I said, if the deletion of the infobox is a personal attack against me, I am not the one that is loosing, its the readers. And about this page move, I fully support the name, and have wanted it changed to Anaheim Hills, Anaheim Hills, California, or Anaheim Hills (California) from the getgo. I just dont like the Anaheim Hills, Anaheim, California name. So I do support the naming portion of your compromise. --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricsaindon154_82f7.html" title="User:Ericsaindon154">Ericsaindon154</a> 23:46, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Wow, thats quite the mess on the article. Maybe that stuff should be put at the bottom, so that you can actually read the article. Oh, and good job Ericsaindon2, not!

<li><b>D</b>. I assume that this is the "Final Naming Poll" (with the very short polling period and very little publicity) that Eric spammed on my user page. As shown by the other polls above, choice D is the preferred choice for most Wikipedia editors who have expressed a preference (and aren't anon IPs or sock puppets). <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankVerse_b65f.html" title="User:BlankVerse"><sup><font color="green"><i>Blank</i></font></sup></a><a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankVerse_add2.html" title="User talk:BlankVerse"><sup><font color="#F88017"><i>Verse</i></font></sup></a> 08:11, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I wish that I could figure out what happened to it, but I know that when I first started editing the Wikipedia 1 1/2 yrs ago, there was someplace (<a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">WP:MOS</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Cities_0174.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Cities">WikiProject Cities</a>,&#160;??) where it clearly stated that article names for communities within a city in the United States should be named "Community, City, State" to avoid ambiguity and confusion. My guess is that someone during an argument over the naming of a particular community decided to delete that strong suggestion from the <a href="../../../r/u/l/WP%7ERULES_e375.html" title="WP:RULES">Wikipedia guidelines</a> and nobody noticed the deletion. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankVerse_b65f.html" title="User:BlankVerse"><sup><font color="green"><i>Blank</i></font></sup></a><a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankVerse_add2.html" title="User talk:BlankVerse"><sup><font color="#F88017"><i>Verse</i></font></sup></a> 08:11, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Or maybe enough editors got over their <a href="../../../o/b/s/Obsessive_compulsive_disorder.html" title="Obsessive compulsive disorder">O-C</a> tendencies long enough to recognize that the convention used by real encyclopedias (just the community name) is not confusing, and actual (as opposed to potential) ambiguities can be handled with standard Wiki conventions while at the same time noting that "Community, City, State" results in non-standard goofy-looking article names that violates the fundamental Wiki naming conventions. --<a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerge_Issakov_7435.html" title="User:Serge Issakov">Serge</a> 08:20, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Earlier today I blocked two users for violating the 3RR over the inclusion of the infobox. Now, two more users are revert warring. The page has been fully protected until this dispute can be resolved. The version that I protected it at is NOT an endorsement of it. It was simply the version that I came across when I saw the revert war continuing. Please, come to an agreement.

<dd>No, that was not my intention at all. I just want this infobox, since it was approved, to go onto a few of Orange Counites community pages. They are all Census materials defined by their zip codes. My point was not to combat my conflicts with other editors. --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricsaindon2_e596.html" title="User:Ericsaindon2">Ericsaindon2</a> 04:16, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In fact, I was hoping that no other community page would end up in such turmoil. A clean black and white community box should be used for ALL communities, and information not avalible for that particular community should be left out (same with adding additional information not on the infobox). I just would hate to see other communities go through so much turmoil. I mean look at this pages conflicts, 13 3rr rule breakings, 1 rfc, 33 pages (printed) of complaining and backstabbing, and a completely split arguement between admins and regular users. I dont think that this war is the way to solve anything, but to make changes so that it can be avoided next time (by adding rules and Wikipedia templates). I hope that you guys can at least support my endeavor to go forward with the new community infobox, and add it to a few pages using the census information on the communities particular zip code. If you just look up the zip codes, all of this information should be there. I would appreciate it alot.--<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricsaindon2_e596.html" title="User:Ericsaindon2">Ericsaindon2</a> 04:23, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And, I must say that I dont have any hard feelings towards anyone. I know that we all have very different ideas about debates like this when rules are not strictly defined. So know that I am not mad at any of you, nor do I hold a grudge. I know we are all human, and have strong opinions about different things, and that is what makes Wikipedia such a great place is that everyone puts in their idea to come up with a final project. Just know that I am not mad at any of you, and I hope you keep taking stands to modify rules you may not like on Wikipedia.&#160;:) --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricsaindon2_e596.html" title="User:Ericsaindon2">Ericsaindon2</a> 04:27, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It wasn't "approved". You added it to that page yourself. Not that an infobox needs "approval", but what you're saying is misleading. The main problem with the statistics in the infobox has always been their unverifiability due to the lack of a reliable source for the neighborhood's definition. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Dillon_27e0.html" title="User talk:Mike Dillon">Mike Dillon</a> 01:49, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I concur. Ericsaindon2's grossly misleading misstatement of the facts is evidence of bad faith on his part. He also still does not understand that the statistics are inherently unreliable because there is no officially recognized neighborhood boundary. He also does not understand that ZIP Codes are not required to correspond with neighborhood or city boundaries, which causes problems in many parts of the United States and California in particular. --<a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcaesar_34f0.html" title="User:Coolcaesar">Coolcaesar</a> 03:32, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This page has been protected for the past two and a half weeks. No discussion has occurred on the issue in the past week on the talk page.

<li>I see no progress either. Ericsaindon2 has either given up on his insane mission to call Anaheim Hills a city, or he is on a wikibreak. Perhaps we can try unprotection for a couple of days, but if Ericsaindon2 then comes back and continues to act in bad faith, the article should be protected again and he should be sent to arbitration! --<a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcaesar_34f0.html" title="User:Coolcaesar">Coolcaesar</a> 03:33, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
