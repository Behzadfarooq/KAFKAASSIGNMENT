<p>Wikipedia is a cesspool. I loved editing here. The problem is, with the constant, unremitting stream of either<br />
a)vandalism<br />
b)POV pushing by axe-grinders<br /></p>
<p>it's just a huge waste of time. oh, there's tons of interesting info here. tons. but the fact that you absolutely, positively, MUST take it with a grain of salt - well, it leaves me thirsty afterwards. I don't have that concern at all when I visit my trusty Columbia Encyclopedia. Oh, the information may be a decade or two out of date - but for a vast amount of knowledge, that garners a great big 'so what'. There's not so much about the Medici's that has changed in the last twenty years.</p>
<p>So, I'm essentially done with wikipedia, at least as a wikipedian. i tried, in good faith, and quite hard, in fact. i edited many articles. i made many positive contributions. but i'd rather spend my time reading, rather than fighting with twits over whether a given sentence is neutral enough. <strong class="selflink">Anastrophe</strong> 07:46, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>i almost posted the quoted segment below on a 'talk' (discussion) page. my bile is rising to uncomfortable levels, so i'll probably be closing this tab in my browser for good soon. i gave it a shot. a good faith shot. but the tone of this place is that 'we are a community, and we wish to keep ourselves pure'. the serbs would be proud.</p>
<p>"perhaps this explains why wikipedians tend to be flummoxed by the criticism of wikipedia. i dunno. all i can say is that after barely two months of good faith efforts on my part to contribute to wikipedia and make it better, i'm about done with this place, driven out by just this kind of 'policy wonk'ishness, and focus on 'process' as more important than 'accuracy'. oh, no doubt, we'll hear the howler monkeys squeal with delight that another 'bad guy' is leaving. totally unclear on the concept. drive out editors who are critical of the way wikipedia works. make sure the 'community' stays 'pure' and free of devil's advocacy. focus on the wiki part - the pedia part is secondary. yep. orlowski's right - it's an online role-playing game, not an encyclopedia." <strong class="selflink">Anastrophe</strong> 17:50, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>kind of felt that needed to be stated up front. Anyone who comes to wikipedia to look up information might just as well flip a coin if they want accuracy. at any given moment, any of more than a million articles may instead of addressing the ostensible topic of the article, be rather stating "you all suck", or "go to hell", or "asdf asdf asdf", or anything else you might randomly think of. Worse, at any given moment, an article might be filled with subtle, falsified information, intended either to sway opinions, or perhaps to settle a score. since some articles tend to be written and maintained almost entirely by people who are heavily invested in the topic, their POV may overwhelm any other editors who attempt to bring a more neutral tone to the topic.</p>
<p>it's pathetic. I started participating actively in wikipedia about October 15, 2005. barely two months later, i'm about ready to fold the tent and move on. WIKIPEDIA IS NOT AN ENCYCLOPEDIA. if you want in-depth information about something, go buy the Columbia Encyclopedia. That's a real encyclopedia. For the most part, you can trust the information in it. You don't have to worry about whether an article was written by someone with a hardcore agenda to pump. you can trust that a group of editors - professionals, who know what they are doing - spent time vetting their colleague's work. no doubt, points-of-view are found in the Columbia. but it ain't nothing like WP.</p>
<p>wikipedia is a colossal failure in my opinion.</p>
<p>very sad. all it would take is a little accountability. this ridiculous obsession with the idea that anonymous editors are somehow representative of this grand notion of liberty and openess that wikipedia thinks it has a corner on is just that - an obsession. behavior manifesting as focus on an idea to the exclusion of rational reflection. all freedom has limits; those limits are known as 'responsibilities' to adults. the first amendment to the constitution does not mean absolutely unfettered freedom of expression. irresponsible expression is not protected by the first amendment. libel and slander are not protected by the first amendment. vandalism is not protected by the first amendment.</p>
<p>wikipedia needs to come down off it's self-made pedestal and join the real world. otherwise, it will cease to exist. not due to any concerted effort to shut it down; it will simply die, because the idea is broken. <strong class="selflink">Anastrophe</strong> 00:44, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I very, very much enjoy editing, browsing, and using wikipedia. I consider myself a Wikipedian. i love words - see above. there's a wealth of information 'in here'. i've learned quite a few things, and have possibly added some information to some entries that'll be of use to someone someday. notably, i have <b>used it as a reference work</b> at times.</p>
<p>I am a very, very strong detractor of wikipedia. I think the philosophy behind the 'wiki' idea is fabulous, but horribly, tragically misguided as a driving philosophy behind an online encyclopedia. If Wikipedia dropped "The Free Encyclopedia" as the tagline for their name and logo, i'd be slighly placated. Wikipedia is just that - Wikipedia. It is <i>NOT</i> an encyclopedia. it is a faux encyclopedia. it's the diamond zirconia of encyclopedias. it's the tofuburger of encyclopedias. it's the naugahyde of encyclopedias. it's the 'she has such a beautiful nose now after the plastic surgery' of encyclopedias. it must be stated in bold: <b>wikipedia is not a reference work</b>, no matter how much one may wish to delude oneself or others that it is. some of the reasons i detail below.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnastrophe-wikipedia_d908.html" title="Edit section: The Problem with Wikipedia">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Problem with Wikipedia</span></h2>
<p>I make no claim to original thought here, i'm sure these arguments have been covered ten thousand times over (i've read some bits of those arguments here and there already in my brief tenure 'here' for that matter):</p>
<p>Anonymous users. the argument made in defense is that it ceases to be a wiki if anonymous users aren't allowed. i would submit that that means that the definition of wiki needs to be corrected. Anonymous users are by far the most common source of vandalism on wikipedia. i've not been 'here' on wikipedia much more than a month, and this is patently obvious. the counter argument is that there are *many* anonymous users who do contribute quality content regularly. Indeed, i won't argue against that fact. However, can one reasonably believe that these anonymous users would not be able to contribute if mandated to create a userid? how many anonymous users are in danger of grave bodily harm if they are 'forced' to choose a userid? How many would be outed as super-dooper NSA spooks if mandated to do so? I realize that some people *choose* to remain anonymous for their own, entirely private, reasons. Well, by the same token, one can choose to participate in wikipedia or not. if someone is unwilling to participate if they can't be anonymous (and really, one can pretty much retain anonymity even if they generate a userid - it's not that revealing ultimately) - then others will take their place. will their contributions be equally as good as those anonymous users who currently submit quality content? certainly - and there will be some that are worse. but the degree of true vandalism will likely plummet.</p>
<p>This brings me to the next problem with wikipedia, that flows from the existence of anonymous users: accountability. Those who are truly anonymous may or may not be accountable. Those who register a userid take one (very small) step up in accountability. however, as noted above, merely creating a userid and password is quite trivial, and does not *actually* eliminate anonymity.</p>
<p>Why is accountability desireable? well, imagine you're reading, for example, the columbia encyclopedia down at your local library (i know - 'how quaint!'). you flip through looking for a particular topic, find the topic, and to your dismay note that someone has taken a knife and cut out parts of the topic, and written their opinions in the margins. you've gone to an authoritative source - but a non-authoritative source has taken it upon themselves to change the meaning by eliding and corrupting. imagine however, that that encyclopedia was kept in a locked case, and one needed to register with the reference librarian in order to view it. ...</p>
<p>heh. i've just ruined my own argument while trying to make it. a vandal could sign in, even using their real name etc - destroy an entry, return the encyclopedia, then someday a year down the road, someone else happens to review that entry - but which of the intervening hundreds of people was responsible for the vandalism. sigh. next!!&#160;;^)</p>
<p>The argument however *does* have validity with regard to WP. here, when one makes an edit, it is recorded. time, place, etc.. those who are anonymous can remain the vandal who marked up the columbia, whereas here, there's a record of it. of course, the anonymous vandal isn't really prevented from doing it - he's merely more easily found out. with real accountability (more in a moment), this problem could be entirely eliminated.</p>
<p>real accountability: well, 'real' is a matter of degrees, but we can call it 90% accountability: requiring a 'challenge/response' email exchange in order to sign up. this is used on even the most immaterial mailing lists on the internet, to keep vandalism (and thugs and trolls and malicious signups etc) to a minimum, and it works. the person signing up must provide an identity, an established 'presence' on the net before beginning to make edits. does it stop the truly motivated vandal? of course not. there are free email accounts available all over the internet. merely sign up with one, and away you go.</p>
<p>but in this process, we've leveraged out the absolutely casual vandal - and again, i'd maintain that they are responsible for the vast majority of the idiotic vandalism that takes place in WP.</p>
<p>so - on to "really real" accountability. how to go about it? ask people to submit a scan of their driver license? good god, no. 'really real' accountability can be accomplished with a consensus mechanism. the only problematic part is that there'd have to be several tens of thousands of existing, upstanding wikipedians who would need to be grandfathered into such a system, and that could create claims of a 'cabal' of sorts. however....</p>
<p>a consensus mechanism would rely upon time delay limits to edits, based upon the consensus algorithm. i'm thinking this through as i write, so bear with me. it's a tiered system.</p>
<p>1. a brand-spanking new user would first of course choose a userid/password, and have to perform a challenge/response in an email exchange via WP to verify the validity of the submitted email address. once established, the user would be able to edit any page. however, the difference would be that edits would not be posted immediately. they would be presented within the article to the user himself, but perhaps outlined or with a shaded background, indicating 'pending'. others - already within the consensus system - woudl be notified of the diff to the article. if, within some set period of time - perhaps 30 minutes? - none of the previous editors of the article reverts it, then the changed text is allowed to 'post through' to the article at large, as seen by those browsing without being WP'ians. this would prevent vandal posts from making it to the at-large published document - the 'real' wikipedia that acts as a reference.</p>
<p>2. after that brand-spanking new user has made at least ten (do i hear twenty?) good faith edits that have not been reverted by the consensus previous editors, then the new user would be 'set free' to edit and have their changes posted in 'real time' as is the current process. they'd be a 'bona fide wikipedian' at that point.</p>
<p>3. once a bona fide wikipedian (hereinafter "BFW"), the next step in consensus begins, which is essentially a provenance system for users. as the BFW accumulates further good faith edits that are not reverted - say, a hundred edits - The user gathers 'provenance points'. for each provenance point, the user's edits become less 'susceptible' to reverts. which is to say, with one provenance point, a BFW user posts an edit to an article. that edit maintains one 'lock' on it - it can't be reverted immediately. the only way it can be reverted immediately is if another BFW registers a revert 'vote'. this gives great power to the community at large, while increasing the quality of edits by BFW's. The more high-quality edits and contributions a BFW submits, the more 'protective' provenance points they accumulate. if a BFW has submitted a thousand article edits that have not been reverted, then it would take the casting of ten 'revert' votes to get one of that author's edits removed/reverted. as always, the WP administrators could be called in if the user suffers an aneurysm and posts a few screens of nonsense that destroys an article.</p>
<p>now, as i mentioned, i'm pretty much formulating this as i write it. it is not by any means a sophisticated, thoroughly parsed, rethought and refined expression (need i even say that, considering the typos??). i also realize that putting in place such a system would entail significant additions to WP's hardware, and software. very significant. costly, certainly.</p>
<p>but i believe these changes would also dramatically increase the overall quality of articles. mind you - i'm specifically referring to *overall* quality. one of the significant problems with WP today is the enormous variability of quality, article to article. as Jimbo has acknowledged, there are some truly execrable entries in WP - the sorts of entries that simply would never appear in an authoritative printed encyclopedia (errors, certainly, absolute poppycock and barely parseable sentences - no). with a system of 'provenance' for authors, i believe the *overall* quality of articles will be significantly evened up. the execrable articles will dissolve. the high quality articles will pervade.</p>

<p>I've contributed to a few dozen articles now. This naturally increases the size of my watchlist. with that increase, i see yet further morphology of the problem above: One definition of insanity is doing something over and over, expecting a different outcome.</p>
<p>Clearly, wikipedia is insane. what i see on my watchlist is a near-non-stop parade of 'rv'. it happens all day, every day. i've read about the study by IBM that says that vandalism is on average reverted within five minutes. hallelujah! so, the random visitor to wikipedia can hope for at worst five minutes during which time they'll read that Bill Clinton was born in puerto rico. Or that those who have abortions are condemned to burn in hell. Or that the spiny trigger fish enjoys fucking britney spears. isn't that GREAT!</p>
<p>one could fashion a full time vocation (albeit one paying one back in nothing but heartache) of reverting vandalism on wikipedia. Many eyeballs make light work though, right? Is that the justification? Patent Nonsense(TM). *There should be no interval during which vandalized pages are viewable*. Should that not be the goal? Merely replying that vandalism can be fixed quickly is like saying it's okay to use a root password of "abc123" on an important server, because once it's hacked, you have a backup you can restore it from easily - so why bother making it secure to begin with?</p>
<p>i enjoy my time on wikipedia, with the exception of dealing with vandalism. as i mentioned up top, i'm a logophile, and get a kick out of refining poorly worded entries, or expanding entries that need more information, or simply adjusting articles on similar topics so that they have a uniform feel. But the tolerance for vandalism is incredibly unfortunate, and a genuine shortcoming - a major shortcoming - of wikipedia. There are some very, very basic steps that can be taken to reduce vandalism, as i've mentioned above. *i'm not claiming they'll mitigate it*. but if they reduced the rate of vandalism by 50%, wouldn't that make WP far, far more enjoyable for everybody? for readers, a greater likelyhood of being able to rely upon the information they read. for authors, less time *completely wasted* cleaning up after the marauding hordes.</p>

<p>That quote has most reliably been attributed to Benjamin Disraeli, though it doesn't appear in any of his writings. Mark Twain claims it as a quote of Disraeli in his own autobiography. The meaning of the quote is pretty easily and widely understood. statistics can tell us many things; however, they can be manipulated in subtle and not so subtle ways to express a point of view that may not be reachable from the data alone. for example, while the number of murders in the united states is at an all-time high, the murder <i>rate</i> - the number of people murdered per unit (100,000) of population - is at a 40 year low; few would claim that this is not good news, even when faced with the higher raw number.</p>
<p>On 19 December 2005, user <a href="../../../n/r/c/User%7ENrcprm2026_854a.html" title="User:Nrcprm2026">James P. S.</a> posted the following graph to the <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming.html" title="Global warming">Global warming</a> article, using [<a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/present/graphics/2001syr/large/08.17.jpg" class="external text" title="http://www.ipcc.ch/present/graphics/2001syr/large/08.17.jpg" rel="nofollow">This graph</a>] as his 'source data':</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/o/s/Image%7ECost-of-storms-by-decade.gif_a81a.html" class="image" title="Image:Cost-of-storms-by-decade.gif"><img src="../../../upload/f/f9/Cost-of-storms-by-decade.gif" alt="Image:Cost-of-storms-by-decade.gif" width="444" height="344" longdesc="../../../c/o/s/Image%7ECost-of-storms-by-decade.gif_a81a.html" /></a></p>
<p>he claimed that this was an accurate extrapolation of current trends. note that the graph begins in 1950, and employs only the decadal averages through 1998 as the five datapoints; it then extrapolates this data to 2050. The graph included the caption "The cost of extreme weather is increasing and could reach a trillion dollars by 2050".</p>
<p>when challenged, based upon a number of shortcomings of the methods used to create the graph, he generated the following new graph, posted on 20 December 2005:</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/o/s/Image%7ECost-of-storms-by-decade.jpg_b103.html" class="image" title="Image:Cost-of-storms-by-decade.jpg"><img src="../../../upload/7/76/Cost-of-storms-by-decade.jpg" alt="Image:Cost-of-storms-by-decade.jpg" width="474" height="374" longdesc="../../../c/o/s/Image%7ECost-of-storms-by-decade.jpg_b103.html" /></a></p>
<p>this, he claimed, was also an accurate graph, because it addressed many of the shortcomings others had cited, responding "After trying to get the first one up, nobody can accuse me of being alarmist after I followed their revision suggestions exactly and got a much more alarming graph". Note that this graph employed the annual values, and extrapolates only to 2025 - and suggests that annual costs of extreme weather will exceed 4 <i>trillion</i> dollars. This is orders of magnitude higher than what was suggested by the first graph - but again, this was portrayed as 'an accurate graph'.</p>
<p>after further criticism was tendered, he uploaded this third graph, claiming, again, that this was an accurate extrapolation of the data:</p>
<p><a href="../../../e/x/t/Image%7EExtreme-weather-cost.gif_ead2.html" class="image" title="Image:Extreme-weather-cost.gif"><img src="../../../upload/9/99/Extreme-weather-cost.gif" alt="Image:Extreme-weather-cost.gif" width="522" height="382" longdesc="../../../e/x/t/Image%7EExtreme-weather-cost.gif_ead2.html" /></a></p>
<p>this third graph suggests costs reaching 350 billion per year by 2025.</p>
<p>so, we have 1 trillion dollars by 2050. or rather, 4 trillion dollars by 2025. no, wait, it's 350 billion dollars by 2025.</p>
<p>translation: you can create any scenario you want by manipulating the numbers in new and interesting ways. further translation: the conclusions we are to draw are meaningless. final translation: lies, damned lies, and statistics. <strong class="selflink">Anastrophe</strong> 20:22, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Nrcprm2026 has taken it upon himself now to modify the existing graph, thus publishing a different graph than what was originally linked to, further confusing the matter. He has added 2005 data to the graph. However, he has not adjusted the 2001-inflation-adjusted values up to 2005 inflation-adjustment, but rather (it would seem - one can only guess at this point due to the lack of rigor in documenting these changes or in appropriately updating the legend and listing of source data) has adjusted the 2005 value to represent the 2001 cost. how brilliant is that - it further exaggerates the ostensible costs, by representing them in inflated dollars, rather than real dollars (to today's inflation rate). <strong class="selflink">Anastrophe</strong> 07:02, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
