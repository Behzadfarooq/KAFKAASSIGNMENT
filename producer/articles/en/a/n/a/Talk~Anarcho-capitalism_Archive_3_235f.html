<h2><span class="mw-headline">Dec 8</span></h2>
<p>This discussion has gotten somewhat off-track, so I'm going to attempt another summary. Before I do, I can't resist responding to your misguided "straw man" accusation. If you were reading what I wrote (clearly not), you'd know that (a) the rape example was to make a point, (b) the car example was to further explain that point (essentially by noting the two examples are the same in the relevant aspect).</p>
<dl>
<dd>lol, okey dokey, you apparently think the point you made applied to my argument though, eh? That is the straw-man, the attribution to myself a position that I do not hold which would entail mothers getting raped with sons standing on hand too confused to do anything about it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">VV</a> I never attributed any such view to you, quite the contrary. Since you failed to understand the argument the first time, I don't know if there is any point in repeating it, but here goes anyway: If an ancap defending their car in a manner consistent with the currents rights regime constitutes <i>imposing their system</i>, then so does thwarting the aforementioned rape with violence. The latter position is absurd, as I assume you would concede (hence the contrary).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Anyway, to summarize the terminology issue:</p>
<p>One side: <i>Anarchism</i> should refer only to a particular, fairly old belief system/movement of people who call themselves <i>anarchists</i>.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Um, no. There are many new movements in anarchism, for example the primitivists. This is misrepresentation on your part. All this "side" is claiming is that anarchism has a particular meaning that the capitalists purposefully ignore.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">VV</a> Christianity is a belief system. Lutheranism may be a "new" belief system, but it is also part of the old one. This is a minor point anyway.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Other self-described anarchists who don't share their views are impostors with no right to the term.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't recall saying anything about impostors or rights. I'm merely pointing out the simple truth that anarchism still has these meanings, they have not yet disappeared despite the capitalists best efforts.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">VV</a> Whatever. You may not have used the word <i>impostor</i> but that is the thrust.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Response: <i>Anarchy</i> in the sense used by these others refers to the absence of a state/government.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Then it is indeed a misnomer, as that is not the literal definition of anarchy. What is more, neo-classical liberals support several forms of government, thus would not be anarchists even if this is all anarchism meant.</dd>
</dl>
<p>There may be another sense in which it refers specifically to that movement, so it may be fair to say there are two different senses of the word <i>anarchism</i>, one "literal" and one a name of sorts.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The "literal" translation of anarchism is absence of rulers. So it just so happens that the literal meaning of the word refers to the group that bears the name. Coincidence?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">VV</a> Your POV about what constitutes a ruler.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In any case, given there is an active movement of capitalists who consider themselves anarchists, the rule of usage dictates that either there are two distinct meanings <i>or</i> the word must be construed broadly. The claim that this other usage is illegitimate is POV.</p>
<dl>
<dd>That is precisely why this page still exists, and isn't deleted by anarchists everytime we come across it. Capitalist views should definately be presented here, having more information allows people to see past their lies and misrepresentations more clearly. The ONLY thing I ask for, and many people through the history of this page ask for, is that the language they use not indicate an absolute truth value of their position. In other words, neutrality.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">VV</a> No such language is used, manifestly.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Other side's possible counter: But in fact they are not anarchists because what they believe in is not "true" anarchy for some reasons</p>
<dl>
<dd>Funny, in all my time here I have never said that, not even once, yet you have attributed it to me on multiple occasions</dd>
</dl>
<p>There is no qualitative difference between private security and the state, <i>or</i> there is no liberty if others have the right to enforce property claims, <i>or</i> the existence of property entails violent enforcement.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually that is "and," "and," and "and."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Response: Your POV. Ancaps believe there <i>is</i> a fundamental difference between these private institutions and government. Disagreement, however strong, is thus non-neutral. Ancaps may in turn see projected left-anarchist societies as being state-like.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sure, both opinions ought to be presented somewhere on wikipedia. You will note that on several occasions I have now said clearly that I don't demand the anarchist position be explicated here. Again, and again, all I demand is that the language used here does not rule our position out. You constantly try to turn away from this and pretend it is about something it is not.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">VV</a> Your position is not ruled out but in fact generously explained in the intro, quite substantially since this is not an article about it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Does that make no one an anarchist? The fact thay they <i>believe</i> in the absence of the state, even if their proposal seems state-like to others, makes ancaps anarchists <i>in this sense</i>.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Here I thought your own definitions made it clear that anarchism was against all forms of government, not merely the state. The fact that you equate the two as identical is fine, but not everyone does. As such even if we limit the word to only one of its meanings and pretend that the root does not call for far more, capitalists would still not be anarchists. But again, these arguments don't need to be on this page.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">VV</a> This seems a bit pointless anyway since both <i>state</i> and <i>government</i> are potentially vague words. You seem to have implicitly conceded this by calling potential ancap institutions states in all but name, on the seeming grounds that they are government-like.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Most of the things you've said about this have in my view not been on point at all. You accuse me of having a double standard, when there's nothing to have a double standard about.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I see, so when I made changes to wording identical to changes you made yourself on other pages, and you reverted it, that was not a double standard. Apparently, neutrality simply means something different on other pages than what it means here.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I see terms such as <i>anarcho-socialist</i>, <i>left-anarchist</i>, and <i>socialist anarchist</i> as disambiguating.</p>
<dl>
<dd>And anarchists see them as blatantly misrepresentative.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">VV</a> How? They may seem redundant to those who think <i>anarchism</i> should refer only to the one position, but redundancy is not misrepresentation. <i>French conservative</i> would seem redundant to those who thought the only valid, historical kind of conservatism was that so called in France, and that what Russians believe is not conservative at all. But the qualifier allows us to be spared taking a position on this. The opinion of those who find it redundant is also stated very clearly in the opening paragraph.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>When there are two different claims to a term, this is the best course.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, so lets make a distinction here. Capitalists diverge from anarchist tradition, they do so admittedly. Capitalist DO NOT think that they arose from anarchism, it says so RIGHT HERE ON THIS PAGE. NONE of the original anarchists were capitalist, neither the individualists nor the collectivist. So obviously the distinction "traditional anarchist" would be valid. No? If you think it would be unclear to readers, lets even make a clause that states explicitly "this label is meant to do nothing more than disambugate between the two theories, it does not imply that "anarcho-capitalists" have no tradition of their own." Good? No? Not satisfied enough yet with your misrepresentations of anarchism? Notice, that there is no "real traditional anarchist" being suggested here, nor has it ever been on the table in this discussion. So why do you keep trying to portray the scenario as if someone is trying to distinguish between "real" and "fake" when no one is? Perhaps because you can't argue the actual issue on the table?</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">VV</a> Ancaps would regard past efforts towards a stateless market order as anarchist, whether so called or not (cf. <i>dinosaur</i> above). Thus <i>traditional</i> is a troublesome qualifier. <i>Socialist</i> is not since you claim your variety/ies of anarchism require socialism.
<dl>
<dd>Do you really think that individualism/egoism have anything to do with socialism? Anti-capitalism&#160;!= socialism. I'm reverting your revert. It would be different if you actually ran things by this discussion page before taking unilateral action. - AaronS</dd>

<dd>Spare me the claims of non-discussion; they're absurd given the history, as is the edit in question. Would you prefer <i>anti-capitalist anarchism</i> then to <i>socialist anarchism</i> as a compromise?

<dd>Regardless of my history, the claims are valid. You have done it again; thus, I am forced to revert it until more discussion is had. Both <i>anti-capitalist anarchism</i> and <i>socialist anarchism</i> are misnomers; just as it would be POV for me to call anarcho-capitalists <i>anarcho-fascists</i>, or some other derogatory term, it is POV to call traditional, Bakunian, Proudhonian, etc, etc anarchists anything other than that which has been historically used in reference to them. With this in consideration, the term <i>traditional anarchism</i> is a clear compromise. It is not POV, since, according to 99.9% of literature on the subject, it factually is traditional anarchism. - Aaron 19:50, 8 Dec 2003</dd>

<dd>This analogy is obviously inapplicable. Said variety of anarchists do claim to be anti-capitalist, while ancaps do not claim to be fascist. Do you really believe this objection? The revert is of an absurd change, renaming ancaps. It is not POV to avoid using a hotly disputed one alone by adding to it a specification of which sense of it you mean. You have provided no objection to <i>anti-capitalist anarchism</i>, nor any reason why it is a misnomer. -- <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">VV</a> 01:25, 9 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First of all, property is an institution of government, by definition. It is the exercise of absolute dominion over a person or thing (Merriam-Webster). <i>Anti-capitalist anarchism</i> is POV because, for many traditional anarchists, anti-capitalism is not on their list of priorities. In fact, many do not even define themselves that way, especially considering the fact that their objection to capitalism is not a <i>socialist</i> one but an <i>anarchist</i> one. This distinction must be clear. Furthermore, <i>anti-capitalist anarchism</i> is a term that I have never seen used before; why it should begin to be used in a supposedly neutral encyclopaedia definition is beyond me. It is not our perogative to create a new language; rather, it is to define things, when necessary, within their historical and contemporary contexts. That said, <i>anti-capitalist anarchism</i> is a misnomer, the equivalent to <i>anti-statist anarchism</i>. Also, your revert edits out clearly non-POV things, such as my inclusion of individualist anarchists with traditional anarchists. For this reason, I am reverting until further discussion is had. -- Aaron 21:14, 8 Dec 2003</dd>

<dd>Property an institution of gov't? <i>By definition?</i> I don't think even Kev asserted such a crazy thing. Your POV, obviously. I am seeking a specifier for this form of anarchism which is not loaded like <i>traditional</i>. <i>Socialist anarchism</i> still seems like the best choice, but I am open to alternatives, including the ones I've proposed. The misnomer talk is puzzling in light of your objection being merely one of emphasis, when the feature emphasized is the distinguishing one in this case. We could even try a proper name, like <i>Proudhonian anarchism</i>. But ancap-&gt;lib-cap is not a solution and will not be one. As for the text on indiv anarchists, it is off topic; we were listing terms used, not all the different component movements, which is not really relevant for this article and out of scope for that paragraph. -- <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">VV</a> 02:36, 9 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Socialist anarchism</i> is just as loaded as <i>traditional anarchism</i>, and is much less accurate, considering the fact that many anti-capitalist anarchists would not call themselves socialists. <i>Proudhonian anarchism</i> leaves even more out. If libertarian capitalism is not a solution, then neither is libertarian socialism. As for individualist anarchism - it <i>is</i> a term that is used to describe traditional anarchism. -- Aaron 22:24, 8 Dec 2003</dd>

<p><i>Christianity is a belief system. Lutheranism may be a "new" belief system, but it is also part of the old one. This is a minor point anyway.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, Lutherans also believe in Christ, making them a part of Christianity. Primitivists also believe in anarchism, making them a part of anarchism. The only way we could claim that capitalists believe in anarchism would be to change the meaning of the word. If Lutherans tried to claim that the Buddha was Christ, then christians would have a pretty good argument that Lutherans aren't christian. If people in Nepal tried to claim that their country was Scottland, then Scottish would have a pretty good argument that people in Nepal are not actually Scottsmen, eh?</dd>

<dd>I never claimed you were the only dissenter. I am saying that you are falsely presenting yourself as some kind of authority on what is or is not a clearcut issue.

<p>But, fine, yes, this very thing does happen. "<a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_American_33b5.html" title="Native American">Native Americans</a>" often call themselves <i>Indians</i>.

If an article were, say, comparing both groups, some terminology would be needed, and in fact the term <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Indian_649f.html" title="American Indian">American Indian</a> is often used.

You only accept particular arguments that we make, carefully weeding out others.

As I have said from the begining, and as I will repeat, I DON'T CARE IF OUR POSITION IS EXPLICATED HERE. All I am asking is that the position of the capitalists be explicated in a neutral manner. You can pretend like I'm asking for something else, but it won't change the fact. If you are unable to accept that capitalism must be introduced through the neutrality policy of wikipedia, then I would also accept a simple header that declares, in bold, "This page does not attempt to be neutral, readers are warned that it is an explicit propaganda by capitalists and does not even attempt to allow for dissenting positions."</dd>

<p>so your comical call for evidence comes off as insincere. <i>Ancaps would regard past efforts towards a stateless market order as anarchist, whether so called or not (cf.</i> dinosaur above).</p>
<dl>
<dd>Then according to this very page, that would mean that "anarcho-capitalists" have their own tradition, but that it is not the tradition of anarchism. After all, as this page clearly indicates, "anarcho-capitalists" believe that they came from liberalism, NOT from anarchism. That means that past "anarcho-capitalist" societies follow in the tradition of liberalism, NOT anarchism. Thus the word "traditional anarchist" quite clearly refers to those following from the people who originally identified with anarchism.</dd>

<p><i>Thus</i> traditional is a troublesome qualifier. <i>Socialist</i> is not since you claim your variety/ies of anarchism require socialism.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Socialism" is not only redundant, it is far too vague. Traditional anarchists are all socialists in different senses of the word. Many egoists and individualists are only socialists insofar as they are anti-capitalist. To call them socialist, and then attribute these positions to them and use their labels interchangably with others is to misrepresent and confuse both positions. Alternatively, to call it another of your suggestions like "anarcho-communism" would be to rule them out altogether. They could, however, be included very easy and simply under the "traditional anarchist" label that Aaron whipped up. Let me repeat myself, "Capitalists diverge from anarchist tradition, they do so admittedly. Capitalist do not think that they arose from anarchism, it says so <i>right here on this page</i>. <i>None</i> of the original anarchists were capitalist, neither the individualists nor the collectivist. So obviously the distinction "traditional anarchist" would be valid."</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>Property an institution of gov't?</i> By definition? I don't think even Kev asserted such a crazy thing.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I would be happy to point out the fact that property is exclusive dominion over a given thing, the ability to use, dispose, and enjoy a thing upheld by way of force. I could further point out that to govern is to control, direct, or strongly influence the actions and conduct of, to exert a determining or guiding influence over. In the face of those two definitions, taken straight from the dictionary without edit, I don't have to claim that property is governance by definition. I only have to wait for you to be silly enough to deny it.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>If you were really looking for a term that wasn't loaded, then you would not chose socialist anarchism, as that blatantly assumes the capitalist position at the outset. "Traditional anarchism" is indeed loaded, but it just happens to be loaded with connotations that capitalists agree with, like the fact that they did not come from the same tradition as anarchists, but rather arose from liberalism. <i>Proudhonian anarchism</i> doesn't work, because again you are trying to squish a huge number of diverse ideologies into a label that does not fit them. "Anarchism" is the label the refer themselves to, universally. They are anarchists, and they are no more or less than anarchists. The <i>compromise</i> of even traditional anarchist is problematic, but it is less so then any other. I would vastly prefer that they be called anarchists, since anarchist is a different word than "anarcho-capitalist" and thus distinguishes them just as well as any false prefix you slap onto the label would. But since no one is going to accept that, "traditional anarchist" will just have to suffice.</dd>

Why is it that they can be refered to exclusively as libertarian socialists on their page, even renaming the entire page to indicate as much, yet refering to capitalists as libertarian capitalists "will not be done?" I didn't even change the page or the headings, just the sub-text. How much more biased can you be?

<p>although of course Aaron is not on board. I still of course do not believe there's anything wrong with MY edits (which are MY attempt at answering everyone's concerns), and I don't see much evidence of <i>constructive</i> criticism of them.</p>

<dd>I know you don't, but I no longer have any hope in this area. I've done my best to explain my reasoning behind every edit. You've disagreed on each and every point. I've tried and tried again, come up with numerous facts on the matter, shown different angles. When you weren't discussing it I implored you to discuss it, when it wasn't going anywhere I voluntarily took a break for your benefit. I noted the historical facts that were relevant, ones that you clearly had no knowledge of. Yet still, you think nothing is wrong with your edits, despite their one-sided nature, despite their constant attempts to push back any change on this page - regardless of the reasoning behind it (the lao tzu edit for example, which you blocked time and again with NO justification and finally gave up on it as it was apparently "silly." The lib soc edit, which you reverted half a dozen times before finally adopting it as your own edit when you feared even that might change)</dd>

<dd>So all that change was compromise? You are saying that if you'd had your way none of those changes would exist on the page? That would be rather sad, as the former version you are comparing it to not only lacks a great deal of relevant information, it is also horribly biased. That sorta indicates that you would prefer the bias, and have only removed it as part of a "compromise." Go ahead VV, revert back to the page you think it so grand. I assure you there are several instances in the history of this page I could revert back to as well, ones long before I even came, and sit on a high horse claiming its been "a whole load of compromise since then." -Kev 12/10/03</dd>
