<p>When I try to view this article (only this article), it's all messed up, for want of a better phrase. It looks like it starts displaying the page, and then when it gets to the table, it starts again from the top of the screen and writes everything over the top of what was there before. Previous versions of the article are the same. This is in Opera 6 on Windows XP (I'm not proud of running Windows XP, but there it is). I can provide a screengrab if needed. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></p>
<p>I'm going to rewrite that table entirely, don't worry. --LMS</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks, looks great now. Just out of interest, and for future reference: do you know what it was exactly that was causing the problem? --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Don't know! I suspect the caption tag isn't supported by Opera. If the table looked good after I removed it, that's probably why. --LMS</p>
<hr />
<p>I'm willing to debate this, but I think the following (the original article) basically omits a lot of essential information about the divided line, and is actually misleading in places. The table really strikes me as unhelpful. It's a nice graphic and it's better than nothing, but simply having English words arranged in boxes like this really doesn't convey anything important that Plato's own metaphor (the divided line itself) wasn't supposed to convey.</p>
<p><b>I agree that most of what was written previously was at best misleading and at worst utter shit. In keeping with Socratic style I have exposed the truth by pointing out how wrong you lot's previous beliefs were. If anyone wants to re-write this in a more conventional style, I think that would be a good idea. Probably best to ditch the article and begin again from scratch.</b></p>
<p>As for the rest (explanations of "Conjecture," "Belief," "Understanding," and "Reason"), without the context of the rest of the discussion of the metaphor, this is just confusing and less than helpful. With the context, it becomes redundant. --<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarry_Sanger_6200.html" title="User:Larry Sanger">Larry Sanger</a></p>

<p>This <b>knowledge</b> is the lowest degree of truth; it is all mere reflections or dreams, and only shadows of the real object itself. Plato is thus saying that a still-life painting of an apple points less to the truth of the apple than the apple itself.</p>
<p><b>Knowledge???????? this is very loose and misleading language, conjecture is not knowledge at all according to Plato. This is a state of ignorence, or at very most, 'opinon' (doxa)</b></p>

<p>This <b>knowledge</b> is higher and helps explain (or make more <b>intelligible</b>) the Conjecture level; this level is the physical apple itself. However, this level is still very limited in that its knowledge of the physical apple cannot grasp the botanist's knowledge of an apple. The <b>botanist's knowledge</b>, what <i>defines</i> an apple, is in the above levels, past the "divided line" between knowledge and opinion.</p>
<p><b>again, this is not knowledge, and this is not 'intelligable'. Only the objects in CE are 'intelligable'. you very incorrectly classed an empirical science such as botony in the CD division. the botanist most certainly belongs in this catagory</b></p>
<p>Botany is perhaps a very good example of something in this division. Note the discussion in book 7 about how concideration of our relative predicates (e.g. heavy, light) lead us, because our mind cannot aquiese in the contradiction that all is heavy and light, lead us to ask questions like "what is heaviness" and "what is lightness". From this we are lead to ask also about the particulars of our world, what is a unified thing (e.g. an apple)? we see that the apple qua apple is a single apple. but then we concider that it may have many parts (the concideration of the botanist, looking at the composition of a physical thing that we generally class as a unitary item).</p>
<p>Now THIS type of concideration, still firmly in the realm of belief, is what leads us to concider the idea of unity and numbers of things as things in themselves, abstracted from any particular instance. I.e it leads us to concider mathematics, which falls in the CD part of the line.</p>
<p>there is a really important reason why mathematics and not empirical science occupy the CD part. the objects of mathematics are accecible only by the intellect, but the objects of the emprical sciences are accecible only by perception.</p>
<p>I can understand how this confusion of yours arose: the way of thinking about objects in empirical sceinces and mathematical thought is similar in many ways, and that is why the sections BC and CD are equivalent in length, but the SUBJECT MATTER of those thoughts is very different.</p>

<p>This level puts us into knowledge instead of belief or opinion; <b>at this level the apple is understood by the botanist's definition of it</b>. Here, <b>all is abstract and universal and unchanging</b>; below, all is concrete and in flux. The limitation, however, is that science and mathematics depend on <b>particulars</b> and physical (the level below, Belief) representations.</p>
<p><b>for my point about science see the note above. For God's sake if you really wanted to put science in this catagory you really would have been better off with something like a priori theoretical physics, but even this is questionable. Are you a botanist by any chance?</b></p>
<p>all is abstract here, that is true. Everything other than the forms depends upon particulars. a representation is also a kind of particular. mathematics is not 'universal' really, at least not in the sense that forms are universal. the study of mathematics for the guardians say is not an end in itself but to train to mind to concider the idea of abstract particulars not physical particulars. mathematics is not exactly unchanging and eternal. But it is indeed truer and of higher metaphysical and epistemological status than botany etc. As this is the intelligable realm, mathematical 'knowledge' is possible.</p>
<p>[N.b. This argument is an illustration of mine and not one used by Plato] To see the difference between empircal science and the abstract pursuit of mathematics concider the difference in certainty one can have about even something like the laws of physics vs the fact that 1+1=2. We only arrive at these scientfic beliefs through inductive reasoning based on our past observations, which are inherently less certain than the fact that 1+1=2, because the truth of the former is inherently fallible and the truth of the latter is inherently infallible, and thus certain. Even if we were brains in vats and there were no apples really, 1+1 would still equal 2.</p>
<p>The kind of reasoning that a scientist performs with respect to various empircally driven postulates, an instance of this logical reasoning being the if... then... conditionals themselves (IF gravity exists THEN objects fall the ground, for instance), is of the same kind as in mathematics (IF 1+1=2 THEN 1+2=3) but the key difference is the subject matter and hence certainty of the postulates in the two cases. We can only gain infallible knowledge therefore through not just reasoning to conclusions from any old postulates but from CERTAIN, intelligable, ones. According to Plato all knoweldge must be infallible, and hence scientfic 'knowledge' is not knowledge. this may seem to be an unrealistically high standard of knowledge but this is what Plato said.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Talk%7EAnalogy_of_the_divided_line_a900.html" title="Edit section: Reason (Dialectic)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../r/e/a/Reason.html" title="Reason">Reason</a> (<a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialectic.html" title="Dialectic">Dialectic</a>)</span></h4>
<p>Finally, we reach pure reason itself. At this level all of the Forms developed in the Understanding level are brought together into unity and into a single Form, the Idea of the Good. Through dialectic reasoning, one can analyze all forms and see their relation to one another.</p>
<p><b>WHAT??? We were able to apply reason to the objects at every level of the line, what we concider here is the form of reason itself. to say 'we reach pure reason' is very very misleading. Dialectic is indeed the method through which Plato says the forms will be revealed, in that any true account of any of the forms, including the form of the good, will stand up the the dialectic method of destroying false hypotheses. The key thing about DE is that we are concidering the forms themselves as our subject matter, and that the only way Plato believes we can be doing this is via dialectic. eventually after concidering the multiplicity of forms we realise that they all really reduce to the form of the good</b></p>
<p>To complete the example of the apple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conjecture: a mirror image, a painting, or a reflection off the water</li>
<li>Belief: seeing and feeling</li>
<li>Understanding: the definition or concept</li>
<li>Reason: the form of the apple is brought together with all other forms and melded into the supreme and complete Idea of the Good</li>
</ul>
<p><b>I think this summary is beyond repair, here's an alternative but with justice, not apples</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Ignorence: concideration of justice in a play or novel</li>
<li>Opinion: concideration of instances in the world that are just and unjust, and seeing patterns</li>
<li>[not easy to classify]: concideration of abstract objects, like mathematical ones</li>
<li>Knowledge: concideration of the form of justice itself, and then the form of the good</li>
</ul>
<p>the third catagory is known to be rather difficult to interpret in a similar way to the others. It is a kind of transitional phase, higher than opinion as it doesn't feature concrete particulars like the instances of justice that we might draw patterns or empirical ethical formulations from, but lower than the true knowledge of forms. I didn't mention the word justice here for good reason. one could in theory move straight from seeing patterns in justice to concidering the form of justice itself, BUT Plato reackons that in actual fact we will need to concider mathematical objects, which are well known abstract objects with physical embodiments, to prepare ourselves mentally for concidering that there is some abstract form of justice such that all conrete instances of it are mere shadows and approximations of it, which is the forth part.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Talk%7EAnalogy_of_the_divided_line_a900.html" title="Edit section: Ratios of the divided line.">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ratios of the divided line.</span></h2>
<p>I can't help but note that the line is divided and subdivided by thirds, rather than by the golden mean. Is this intentional? Did Plato ever explicitly state a proportion, or just that it shouldn't be half? Seems to me that it should be the golden mean, since both Socrates and Plato drew from Pythagoras.</p>
<p><br />
<b>answer:</b> I think you've been reading too much of the da vinci code... the goldern ratio is totally unessential to this and is not at all relevant to this allegory. Plato doesn't state a specific ratio by which the line must be divided, and then further subdivided, except that one part in each subdivision must be longer than the other (i.e. 1:1 is excluded). The exact ratio is not important whatsoever, but what, given any ratio, a line divided in this way, will reduce to. suppose the length AC = x, CE = y and x + y = z. Then it follows that the lengths are:</p>
<p>AB = x*x/z = x^2/z</p>
<p>BC = x*y/z = xy/z</p>
<p>CD = y*x/z = xy/z</p>
<p>DE = y*y/z = y^2/z</p>
<p>so that a line divided in this way by any ratio x:y and then the divided parts being divided again, reduces to a line divided in the ratio:</p>
<p>x^2:xy:xy:y^2 = AB:BC:CD:DE</p>
<p>i.e. the two middle sections are identical in length, which is important as far as length implies clarity/understanding or however we interpret the allegory. which is important as we are supposed to move without any major increase in clarity from the concideration of objects to the concideration of mathematics say. I'm shocked that the diagram of the line on this page doesn't seem to show this eqauality. Also, the ratio of AB:DE, the difference between ignorence and knowledge of the form of the good, is greater than the mere difference between the empirical and intelligable parts of the line by a squaring of the ratio. This emphasises how great the episomological significance is between the knowledge of the form of the good and ignorence (Akrasia).</p>

<p>Before I launch this crtique, let me say thet this article, is well wriiten, and accurately reflects most contemporary understanding of Plato's divided line. The problem is that it does refect <i>contemporary</i> understanding which means it is almost by definition biased toward empericism, materialism, Aristotelianism. An accurate explanation of the divided line without that bias means basically everything in the current article gets shifted down one step: The world of sense objects IS the world of shadows; and does not differ substantially from what we call shadows, images, etc. What we call science is NOT a form af higher knowing, but a system of beliefs, albeit a pretty effective system, still just "a likely story." The two forms of higher knowing are "dianoetic" and "noetic" fr. Grk. nous, noesis, dianoesis Reason is dianoetic, "divided knowing" (hence rational, ratio), intermediate between the World of pure ideas and our everyday experience and is the souls mediation of how universal meaning appears in our concepts and perceptions. This definition is thus very different from the common definition of reason as scientific judgement (ie logical rasoning). Noesis is pure contemplation of the divine Ideas, knowledge without any intermediary relationship, a knowledge by pure "being", a state of "void" consciousness, a kind of knowing that has just begun to dawn on the horizon of contemporary understanding.

<p>I agree in that the article is well written however i think that the page would benefit most from an image or diagram with the information bellow. The reason is that most students learn the divided line and the Allegory of the cave in introduction classes and these are very difficult to grasp without the use of an aide. If someone has an image i think it would be timeworthy to critique it and then post something that is agreeable to the majority. -alexderbez 3/4/2007</p>
