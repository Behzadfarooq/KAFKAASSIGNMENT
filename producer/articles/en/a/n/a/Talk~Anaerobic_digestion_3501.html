<p>The article states that the energy consumption is larger than the energy output from the plant (Last section under the Reactor types heading)I find this very unlikely and contradictory to articles I've read on the subject. For example, in the article "Kompostering eller rötning? En jämförande studie med LCA-metodik" by Nilsson, B. (1997) (this article is refered to in another article thats available online: "Life Cycle Assessments of Energy from Solid Waste" by Finnveden et. al. (2000) <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 91-7056-103-6</a>) inventory data was collected at the digestion plant in Kristianstad, Sweden wich shows that the energy content of the methane gas collected from the anaerobic digestion is 3743 MJ/ton food waste, and of that only 495 MJ is used internally at the plant. -- KristoferP 15:02, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well spotted. Whoever wrote this addition badly worded their intentions. I have deleted this. On most major AD facilities there is a net output of electricity. The operational facility I worked at at Hiriya, Tel Aviv had an energy output 5 times the plants operational requirements.--<a href="../../../v/o/r/User%7EVortexrealm_bdaa.html" title="User:Vortexrealm">Alex</a> 16:38, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Technically I believe there should be some reworking of this. I have created the Category: Anaerobic digestion as there is a significant number of articles that are linked to this subject. I am in two minds if to <b>merge anaerobic digesters with biogas powerplants</b> and to <b>merge anaerobic digestion with anaerobic decomposition</b>. Anaerobic digesters and biogas power plants are the physical buildings constructed to make use of the process of anaerobic digestion/decomposition.</p>
<p><s>There is a lot of similarity between <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anaerobic_digestion.html" title="Anaerobic digestion">anaerobic digestion</a>/anaerobic digesters and <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biogas_powerplant.html" title="Biogas powerplant">biogas powerplants</a>.

<p><s>There is a lot to be added to this, a lot to be corrected and changed, unfortunately I know very little about the subject, but I’m trying to learn. It’s better than what was here on the subject before, which was nothing, but hopefully this will get the ball rolling and if you can correct this, make it better, or add something of value, please do. Renewable energy is an important subject, the more knowledge on the subject that is out there the better.</s></p>
<p><s>Sorry if my comments seemed brusque. No criticism was intended - its good to see a useful article taking shape. I have done some editing based mostly on <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_7642.html" title="UK">UK</a> sewage treatment and agricultural waste experience. We probably need articles or references for acidogenesis and acetagenesis if these terms are to stay in here. Looks like a good start.<br />

<p>I was hoping to read about the potential of anaerobic digesters for hog farms. From what I understand it could serve as an important supplement to natural gas.</p>
<p>-When I get some free time, I will try to add to this article. In particular, I'd like to include some mention of plug-flow (as opposed to completely-mixed) digesters, since they are more efficient and much less expensive to build. Also, I know that New York State offers net-metering (as with PV) for certain biogas digesters, and several dairy farms in the region are able to meet and even surpass their entire energy need through processing of cow manure -- so maybe I'll look into that. Furthermore, there's a tremendous amount of research going on at the college where I go to school (Cornell University) that concerns anaerobic digestion -- not to mention interesting research that has been going on for decades. One of my professors had a project in the '70s that diverted waste flow from the Ithaca municipal waste treatment plant, treated it with anaerobic digestion (plug flow, of course), then used the nutrient-rich effluent in hydroponic production of ornimentals, all very successfully until his funding was revoked by nay-sayers and militant conventionalists. The contrast between my professor's experiment and the conventional approach to waste treatment is stark -- one approach, the brute-force approach, requires large amounts of energy (in addition to steel and concrete), produces nothing of value and sends large amounts of biosolids to the landfill; the other, the ecological approach, instead produces energy, as well as valuable byproducts, and minimizes or even eliminates flow into the landfill -- it even uses less land area...!</p>
<p>I'm taking another class with that same professor this semester, so this kind of stuff is on my mind a lot. At semester's end, I'll probably do some contributing. I'll try to keep my enthusiasm contained.</p>

<p>If a great deal of money were invested, could large scale implementation of anaerobic digesters be sufficient to reduce America's (and other industrialzed nations') natural gas consumption? Natural gas appears to be causing the same kind of geopolitical problems as petroleum and yet all signs point toward the problem getting worse. Is anaerobic digestion a potential solution? In neither the anaerobic digestion nor the <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biogas.html" title="Biogas">Biogas</a> articles can I find information on how much potential the technologies have for reducing natural gas consumption. If most American cities topped out the anaerobic digestion potential of sewage and other waste matter would their natural gas consumption only go down slightly, or might it drop considerably? Ideally I'd like to see America remain independent of LNG imports, but I have no idea if that's possible with anaerobic digestion.</p>
<p>Yes, by utilising the correct AD technologies that enable the highest concentrations of methane in the biogas it is possible to reduce natural gas consumption. In less pure biogas streams, cleaning or scubbing of the gas may be required. If you are interested in the subject please see the links on my profile or email me. --<a href="../../../v/o/r/User%7EVortexrealm_bdaa.html" title="User:Vortexrealm">Alex</a> 07:57, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It is also worth remembering that managed land-fill can generate substantial quantities of bio-gas over periods of many years. Unfortunately the potential here is not as great as it may seem since a great deal of waste has the carbon locked up in plastics that are difficult or impossible to degrade. This has the overall impact of converting fossil fuels into carbon that is seqestrated in the ground. <a href="../../../v/e/l/User%7EVelela_9e42.html" title="User:Velela">Velela</a> 14:59, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Landfill gas is much harder to collect efficiently than fully engineered anaerobic digesters. It also has lower levels of methane and higher levels of siloxanes which are abbrasive to gas engines. Landfill gas escapes much more easily into the atmosphere and is a significant greenhouse gas. There are major benefits to engineered anaerobic digesters over landfill gas capture. --<a href="../../../v/o/r/User%7EVortexrealm_bdaa.html" title="User:Vortexrealm">Alex</a> 16:20, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't disagree, but if one is looking at the biggest picture "How can we offset our use of gas from fossil fuel sources" then getting better at maximising the land-fill contribution should feature in the debate. If we managed land-fill differently so as to maximise gas generation, then it would become more economic even if it was only used to fuel district heating or other similar local use. At present very large volumes of methane are vented in an uncontrolled way adding significantly to the greenhouse effect when we could have collected and burnt it to offset our use of primary fossil fuels. It would also be intersting to know the respective calorific values of all the sewage sludge and of all the solid waste and compare them. I suspect that in the UK domestically, more energy in solid waste is thrown away than is discharged to the sewers. Anybody up for the calculation&#160;? <a href="../../../v/e/l/User%7EVelela_9e42.html" title="User:Velela">Velela</a> 16:29, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If you look at the present legislation for landfills, the waste management industry is moving towards the minimisation and eventual elimination of biodegradable waste entering into landfill. In the mean time landfill gas must be fully utilised as a green energy source. It is my personal oppinion that anaerobic digestion is ideal for the pretreatment of waste for the controlled production of biogas for utilisation in energy generation (as opposed to random in landfills) and will form a significant basis of waste management in the UK for the future. (this is if the government doesnt have its way with the wide scale introduction of incinerators across the country) --<a href="../../../v/o/r/User%7EVortexrealm_bdaa.html" title="User:Vortexrealm">Alex</a> 14:54, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
