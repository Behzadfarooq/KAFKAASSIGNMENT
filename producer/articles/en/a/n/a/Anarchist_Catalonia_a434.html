The most effective anarchist unit in <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catalonia.html" title="Catalonia">Catalonia</a> was the <a href="../../../d/u/r/Durruti_Column_5157.html" title="Durruti Column">Durruti Column</a>, led by already legendary militant Buenaventura Durruti. It was the only anarchist unit which managed to gain respect from otherwise fiercely hostile political opponents. In a section of her memoirs which otherwise lambastes the anarchists, <a href="../../../d/o/l/Dolores_Ibarruri_7498.html" title="Dolores Ibarruri">Dolores Ibarruri</a> states: "The (Spanish Civil) war developed with minimal participation from the anarchists in its fundamental operations. One exception was Durruti..." (<i>Memorias de Dolores Ibarruri</i>, p. 382). The column began with 3,000 troops, but at its peak was made up of about 8,000 men. They had a difficult time getting arms from a fearful <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Spanish_Republic_b8a3.html" title="Second Spanish Republic">Republican government</a>, so Durruti and his men compensated by seizing unused arms from government stockpiles. Durruti's death on November 20, 1936 weakened the Column in spirit and tactical ability; they were eventually incorporated, by decree, into the regular army. Over a quarter of the population of Barcelona attended Durruti's funeral. It is still uncertain how Durruti died; modern historians tend to agree that it was an accident, perhaps a malfunction with his own gun or a result of friendly fire, but widespread rumors at the time claimed treachery by his men; anarchists tended to claim that he died heroically and was shot by a fascist sniper.</p>
<p>Another famous unit was the <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron_Column_8a05.html" title="Iron Column">Iron Column</a>, comprising ex-convicts and other "disinherited" Spaniards sympathetic to the Revolution. The Republican government denounced them as "uncontrollables" and "bandits," but they had a fair amount of success in battle. In March of 1937 they were incorporated into the regular army.</p>
<p>In 1936, the main anarchist movement, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederaci%C3%B3n_Nacional_del_Trabajo_b9fe.html" title="Confederación Nacional del Trabajo">CNT-FAI</a>, decided, after several refusals, to collaborate with the Catalan government of <a href="../../../l/l/u/Llu%C3%ADs_Companys_i_Jover_92fd.html" title="Lluís Companys i Jover">Lluís Companys i Jover</a>. <a href="../../../j/u/a/Juan_Garc%C3%ADa_Oliver_101d.html" title="Juan García Oliver">Juan García Oliver</a> became Minister of Justice (where he abolished legal fees and had all criminal dossiers destroyed), <a href="../../../d/i/e/Diego_Abad_de_Santill%C3%A1n_6422.html" title="Diego Abad de Santillán">Diego Abad de Santillán</a> became <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finance_minister.html" title="Finance minister">Minister of the Economy</a>, and <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federica_Montseny_0458.html" title="Federica Montseny">Federica Montseny</a> became Minister of Health, to name a few instances.</p>
<p>During the Spanish Civil War, many anarchists outside of Spain criticized the CNT-FAI leadership for entering into government and compromising with communist elements on the Republican side. Indeed, during these years the anarchist movement in Spain gave up many of its basic principles; however, those in Spain felt that this was a temporary adjustment, and that once Franco was defeated, they would continue in their libertarian ways. There was also concern with the growing power of authoritarian communists within the government. Montseny later explained: "At that time we only saw the reality of the situation created for us: the communists in the government and ourselves outside, the manifold possibilities, and all our achievements endangered."</p>
<p>Indeed, some anarchists outside of Spain viewed their concessions as necessary considering the grim possibility of losing everything should the fascists win the war. <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emma_Goldman_57e3.html" title="Emma Goldman">Emma Goldman</a> said, "With Franco at the gate of Madrid, I could hardly blame the CNT-FAI for choosing a lesser evil: participation in government rather than dictatorship, the most deadly evil."</p>
<p>To this day, the issue remains controversial among anarchists.</p>

<p>Anarchism started a profound libertarian revolution throughout Spain which, at least partially, it provoked the fascist reaction. Also, anarchism was both frowned upon and feared by the Spanish Republic, which considered the anarchists out of control and neither loyal to the Republic nor helping enough with the war. Clashes were particularly harsh between Communists and Anarchists, since both movements found themselves completely at odds with each other.</p>
<p>Much of Spain's economy was put under worker control; in anarchist strongholds like Catalonia, the figure was as high as 75%, but lower in areas with heavy socialist influence. Factories were run through worker committees, agrarian areas became collectivized and run as libertarian <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commune_%28intentional_community%29.html" title="Commune (intentional community)">communes</a>. Even places like hotels, barber shops, and restaurants were collectivized and managed by their workers.</p>
<p>The anarchist held areas were run according to the basic principle of "<a href="../../../f/r/o/From_each_according_to_their_ability%2C_to_each_according_to_their_need.html" title="From each according to their ability, to each according to their need">From each according to their ability, to each according to their need</a>." In some places, <a href="../../../m/o/n/Money.html" title="Money">money</a> was entirely eliminated, to be replaced with vouchers. Under this system, goods were often up to a quarter of their previous cost.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Despite the critics clamoring for maximum efficiency, anarchic communes often produced more than before the collectivization.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> The newly "liberated" zones worked on entirely libertarian principles; decisions were made through councils of ordinary citizens without any sort of bureaucracy. (It should be noted that the CNT-FAI leadership was at this time not nearly as radical as the rank and file members responsible for these sweeping changes.)</p>
<p>In addition to the economic revolution, there was a spirit of <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural.html" title="Cultural">cultural</a> revolution. Some traditions were deemed as "oppresive" and done away with. For instance the idea of "<a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_love.html" title="Free love">free love</a>" became popular.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchist_Catalonia_a434.html" title="Edit section: Counter-revolution">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Counter-revolution</span></h4>
<p>During the Civil War, the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_Party_76ce.html" title="Communist Party">Communist Party</a> gained considerable influence due to the necessity of aid from the Soviet Union. <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist.html" title="Communist">Communists</a> and liberals on the Republican side gave considerable effort to crush the anarchist revolution, ostensibly to bolster the anti-Fascist effort (the response was, "The revolution and the war are inseparable"). <a href="../../../p/r/a/Pravda.html" title="Pravda">Pravda</a> announced in December of 1936 that "...the mopping up of <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trotsky.html" title="Trotsky">Trotskyists</a> and anarcho-syndicalists has already begun. It will be carried out with the same vigor as in the <a href="../../../u/s/s/USSR_2531.html" title="USSR">USSR</a>." Another communist<sup class="noprint">[<a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_weasel_words_0886.html#Examples" title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words"><i><span style="white-space: nowrap;">attribution needed</span></i></a>]</sup> boldly proclaimed in an interview that they would "make short work of the anarchists after the defeat of Franco." Their efforts to weaken the revolution were ultimately successful: hierarchy was eventually restored in many of the collectivized areas, and power was taken away from workers and unions, to be monopolized by the Communist <a href="../../../p/o/p/Popular_Front_%28Spain%29_36c2.html" title="Popular Front (Spain)">Popular Front</a>.</p>

<p>Most important, perhaps, were the measures to destroy the militias, who were arguably leading the war effort in spirit as well as in action. The militias were eventually declared illegal and technically merged with the Popular Army. This had the effect of demoralizing the soldiers and taking away what they had ultimately been fighting for: not for the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>, but for themselves and for freedom. <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vladimir_Antonov-Ovseenko_eba2.html" title="Vladimir Antonov-Ovseenko">Vladimir Antonov-Ovseenko</a>, working in Spain for <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalin.html" title="Stalin">Stalin</a>, had predicted this in 1936: "Without the participation of the CNT, it will not, of course, be possible to create the appropriate enthusiasm and discipline in the people's militia/Republican militia."</p>
<p>Indeed, the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counter-revolution.html" title="Counter-revolution">counter-revolutionary</a> fervor often served to weaken the anti-Fascist war effort. For example, a huge <a href="../../../c/a/c/Cache_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Cache (disambiguation)">cache</a> of arms was allowed to fall to Francoist forces for fear that it otherwise would end up in the hands of the anarchists. Troops were pulled off the front lines to crush anarchist collectives. Many able soldiers were assassinated for their political ideology; a leader of the repressive efforts, <a href="../../../e/n/r/Enrique_Lister_1d88.html" title="Enrique Lister">Enrique Lister</a>, said that he would "shoot all the anarchists [he] had to." It was revealed that many anarchists were being held in prisons under Communist orders, rather than fighting on the front, and that furthermore many of these prisoners were tortured and shot.</p>
<p>In what became known as the "<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barcelona_May_Days_9ae4.html" title="Barcelona May Days">Barcelona May Days</a>", the most dramatic repressive effort against the anarchists happened in May of 1937. Communist-led police forces attempted to take over a CNT-run telephone building in Barcelona. The telephone workers fought back, setting up barricades and surrounding the Communist "Lenin Barracks." Five days of street fighting ensued, causing over 500 deaths. This tragic series of events within the Spanish Republic greatly demoralized the workers of Barcelona and without a doubt helped the Francoist army advances elsewhere.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the government sent in 6,000 men to disarm the workers, and the FAI was outlawed. However, the Communist workers were allowed to keep their weapons; only the anarchists were forced to turn them in. This is not surprising considering that the Police and government in Barcelona were overtly Communist-run by this point. The militant <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friends_of_Durruti_7a24.html" title="Friends of Durruti">Friends of Durruti</a> group encouraged the fighting to continue, feeling that defeat by the Communists would ruin the strength of the anarchist movement. Their call was not heeded.</p>
<p>Throughout the Civil War, the various Communist <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newspaper.html" title="Newspaper">newspapers</a> engaged in a massive <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a> campaign against the anarchists and the <a href="../../../p/o/u/POUM_a91b.html" title="POUM">POUM</a>. They were often called "<a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler.html" title="Hitler">Hitlerites</a>" and "fascists" in the pay of Franco, as George Orwell notes in <i>Homage to Catalonia</i>: "Just imagine how odious it must be to see a young 15-year old Spaniard brought back from the front lines on a stretcher, to see, poking out from under the blanket an anemic, bewildered face and to think that in London and Paris there are gentlemen dressed to the nines, blithely engaged in writing pamphlets to show this little lad is a covert fascist." The unreliability of these newspapers peaked when not even one reported the events of <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barcelona_May_Days_9ae4.html" title="Barcelona May Days">May 1937</a>.</p>
