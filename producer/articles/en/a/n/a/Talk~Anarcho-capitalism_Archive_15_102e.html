<p>"<i>Another branch of individualism was found in the United States and was far less radical. The American Benjamin Tucker (1854-1939) believed that maximum individual liberty would be assured where the free market was not hindered or controlled by the State and monopolies. The affairs of society would be governed by myriad voluntary societies and cooperatives, by, as he aptly put it, “un-terrified” Jeffersonian democrats, who believed in the least government possible. Since World War II this tradition has been reborn and modified in the United States as anarcho-capitalism or libertarianism.</i>" This is in the UK version of the Encyclopedia. <a href="http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568770/Anarchism.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568770/Anarchism.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 17:35, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Infinity, stop deleting sourced information for anarcho-capitalism being individualist anarchism. I gave 4 sources. You need to realize that "individualist anarchism" is not one kind of anarchism. It's a broad category. If someone says they're an individaulist anarchist, they could be an anarcho-capitalist, a mutualist, a voluntaryist, etc. Some anarcho-capitalists don't refer to themselves as anarcho-capitalists, but simply individualist anarchists --for example, Wendy McElroy. Don't force me to add more than 4 sources. This is ridiculous. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 20:54, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>That is POV. I could find thousands of sources saying anarcho-capitalism is not individualist anarchism. It is only a minority that supports what you are trying to add. So, by default, you do not add it. -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfinity0_7a16.html" title="User:Infinity0">infinity</a><span style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="../../../i/n/f/User_talk%7EInfinity0_df0a.html" title="User talk:Infinity0">0</a></span> 20:58, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>None of the names listed are "commonly used" except for "free market anarchism." I'll just make it clear in the sentence presenting the list that these terms are "sometimes" used. I'm not going to put "disputed" in there unless you can find a source disputing that it's sometimes called individualist anarchism, which you'll never find. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 21:13, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

"It's sometimes called ind-anarchism" is POV, because it fails to mention that many people don't think of it that way at all. Besides, it's called a type of ind-anarchism, not synonymous with it. -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfinity0_7a16.html" title="User:Infinity0">infinity</a><span style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="../../../i/n/f/User_talk%7EInfinity0_df0a.html" title="User talk:Infinity0">0</a></span> 21:25, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You're wrong. It's not POV. And, it is synonymous with it as well. Some of the sources I provide use the term interchangeably. There is nothing POV about it. There is no shortage of sources. 4 is enough. Here is another --maybe no a citable source, but just to let you see that "individualist anarchism" is a broad term that includes all individualist philosophies that oppose the State. <a href="http://www.spaz.org/~dan/ias/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.spaz.org/~dan/ias/index.html" rel="nofollow"><i>The Individualist Anarchist Society at UC Berkeley</i></a>) <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 21:30, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, well done. Ind-anarchism can be argued to include a-capitalism. But there is no way you can possibly argue that a-capitalism is synonymous with it.

<dl>
<dd>Yes I can argue that it is synomous with it. Some people that you would call anarcho-caitalists don't use the term for themselves. I gave you the example of Wendy McElroy --she calls herself an individualist anarchist. Also, you gave that useless rag "Anarchist FAQ" as a source for disputing that anarcho-capitalism is a type of individualist anarchism. I don't see them making that claim in there. Nevertheless, it needs to be noted that the FAQ was written by communists that reject individualist anarchism --a useless source. I noted that in the article. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 21:37, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I'm considering taking out your Anarchist FAQ source and dispute. Those communists are saying that the labor-value individualists, like Benjamin Tucker are not capitalist. They're not saying there they they think that anarcho-capitalism is not a form of individualist anarchism.

<p>Isn't Individualist Anarchism supportive of socialism? I know Benjamin Tucker was a self described socialist FionMacCumhail 23:50, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Capitalism and socialism don't have the same definitions that they used to have. Tucker supported private ownership of the means of production and a market economy. Capitalism used to be defined as concentration of capital in a few hands. Socialism had another definition before it meant collective ownership of the means of production --how it was defined is not altogether clear. Webster's" dictionary that was around in 1887 defined it as "a theory of society which advocates a more precise, more orderly, and more harmonious arrangement of the social relations of mankind than has hitherto prevailed." Tucker had his own idiosyncratic definition --"labor in possession of its own" --that individuals have a right to own the full product of their labor. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 02:32, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"By 'capitalism' most people mean neither the free market simpliciter nor the prevailing neomercantilist system simpliciter. Rather, what most people mean by 'capitalism' is this free-market system that currently prevails in the western world. In short, the term 'capitalism' as generally used conceals an assumption that the prevailing system is a free market. And since the prevailing system is in fact one of government favoritism toward business, the ordinary use of the term carries with it the assumption that the free market is government favoritism toward business. And similar considerations apply to the term 'socialism.' Most people don't mean by 'socialism' anything so precise as state ownership of the means of production; instead they really mean something more like 'the opposite of capitalism.' Then if 'capitalism' is a package-deal term, so is 'socialism' — it conveys opposition to the free market, and opposition to neomercantilism, as though these were one and the same."—<a href="../../../r/o/d/Roderick_Long_4e23.html" title="Roderick Long">Roderick Long</a><a href="http://www.mises.org/story/2099" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mises.org/story/2099" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.

<p>Note that most of these sources, including from Academician, not only "relate" anarcho-capitalism to individualist anarchism but refer to anarcho-capitalism as individualist anarchism. Anarcho-capitalism IS individualist anarchism. There are various kinds of individualist anarchism, such as Stirnerism, Mutualism, Voluntaryism, and Anarcho-capitalism. Of course there's always going to be people saying anarcho-capitalism is not a form of anarchism, but that's besides the point.

<dd>Two whole sections of the FAQ are arguing against a-capitalism being a type of anarchism at all. By logic:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>The FAQ argues a-capitalism is not anarchism.</li>
<li>Ind-anarchism is a type of anarchism, and the FAQ acknowledges this.</li>
<li>Therefore, FAQ argues that a-capitalism is not a type of ind-anarchism. (IA is a subset of A, AC is NOT a subset of A, therefore AC is NOT a subset of IA).</li>
<li>The article claims that ind-anarchism is another word used for a-capitalism (IA equals AC)</li>

<p>The box originally stated (when I entered the fray): "Other terms sometimes used for this philosophy include:" This is not saying that individualist anarchism is identical with anarcho-capitalism - it is just saying that the term is sometimes used.

<p>Infinity, you're ignoring the body of thought that suggests that any sort of control mechanism isn't pure anarchism, and anything but true free-market economics has controls in place? I'd say that this argument pretty clearly shows that a-c is a type of anarchism, and that it is a highly individualist form of such, so can quite reasonably be described that way. -- ConcretePeanut 20:37, 13 March 2006 (GMT)</p>

<dd>The quote " There is a nice historical irony in Caplan's attempts to use Kropotkin to prove the historical validity of "anarcho"-capitalism. This is because while Kropotkin was happy to include Tucker into the anarchist movement, Tucker often claimed that an anarchist could not be a communist!" from that source makes me slightly dubious as to it's validity. So what if Tucker claimed an anarchist couldn't be a communist? I agree completely. What if Kropotkin was happy to include such a person with such a view in his idea of anarchism/anarchists - it just goes to show that 1) T agreed with anarcho-capitalist thought (in at least some forms) that communism was not compatible with anarchism, and 2) that K thought this was a perfectly reasonable point of view for an anarchist to hold. In fact, it undermines the 'irony' of Caplan's attempts.</dd>
</dl>
<p>As it there are plenty of much more reliable sources than that link that put forward quite clear and supported arguments for not only anarcho-capitalism being a valid form of anarchy and communism being an incompatible ideology in regards to anarchism, but also several solid arguments that would support the idea that a free market is necessary to a truly anti-authoritarian system such as anarchism. Just as an example, how can you be said to be truly free to act with liberty and outside of state interference if you aren't allowed to trade goods/labour for what you can get for them?</p>
<p>I'm sorry, but your reliance on that one source is detrimental to your argument, as it is by no means an infallible source (I would personally call it a fairly baised and poor source, and I'd no doubt be crucified if I ever used it as the main point of reference for any serious writing). If you are so sure you are right and it is the majority that agree with you then you shouldn't have trouble finding an overwhelming number of different, valid, and respectable sources to support that claim, rather than point-of-view from a single baised source, which strangely enough was what you seemed to be objecting to in the first place. -- ConcretePeanut 22:52, 13 March 2006 (GMT)</p>

If you think asking for clarification an act of arrogance then, well, you may be mistaken. Perhaps if you addressed my points in my previous response I'd have a clearer idea of what you think and why you are arguing as you are, but if you are unwilling to address them for whatever reason then it could be you are expecting too much from others to address your own concerns regarding whatever topic is up for debate.

It would seem that there is a much stronger argument for putting in the fact that it is often accepted as being true, but there are some groups who disagree, although their justification for doing so is disputed, rather than the original suggestion that it is as having a disputed marker next to it. My only purpose in commenting here (I am still very new here, so I'm keeping myself to the background discussion rather than the actual article writing for the moment) is to put whatever weight I can (through argument and reasoning) behind what I would strongly suggest is the correct nomenclature and reasoning. -- ConcretePeanut 00:24, 14 March 2006 (GMT)</dd>

<dd>In fact, having read more of that link my opinion of it has fallen further - "Liberty without equality is only liberty for the powerful, and equality without liberty is impossible and a justification for slavery." suggests that slavery is compatible with equality, which is clearly nonsense as slavery is practically one of the defining examples of inequality. Also, from a more socialist/communist standpoint you could easily (in theory) have equality without liberty, so long as you have sufficient compassion. The fact that shortly after that comment it claims that all anarchists view capitalism as usury just goes on to compound the support for the bais of the site.</dd>

<dd>You're trying to make out that a-capitalism is a major school of anarchism - it isn't; most anarchists denounce a-capitalism. Anarcho-capitalist views are fringe. <i>"correct nomenclature and reasoning"</i> is also your own POV. <i>"it is often accepted"</i> - no, it's not.

<dd>I'm trying to support the argument that you are wrong in saying a-c isn't comparable or a form of i-a. Anyway, I wasn't aware that any school of anarchism was 'major', assuming you discount the mid-teens rallying against authority simply because that is what they do. Anarchism itself is a relatively fringe movement these days, and anarcho-capitalism (at least from the areas I've seen of it) isn't significantly smaller than many other 'accepted' forms of anarchism. If you look carefully at the reason many people dispute a-c's validity it isn't on what are claimed to be anarchistic/liberty principles, but generally (if not exclusively) on socialist/communistic grounds, and such people are better referred to as socialist-anarchists or socialist-libertarians than true anarchists, as they still promote the idea of enforcing economic controls on the individuals within society. How can you say that something is true anarchism if it won't allow someone to choose to offer services or goods for a price, and others to choose to accept or refuse those same things? This is not POV stuff any more than <i>any</i> political ideology is POV - what is best for whom, and how should it be achieved, in <i>my</i> opinion is the unspoken qualifier that goes as taken before any political viewpoint is argued for or outlined.</dd>

<dd>I was originally drawn to this article as a source of information for a presentation I have to give tomorrow, and thought the discussion behind it might be equally or more useful. I felt the need to step in and put forward these points because I was rather distressed to read that someone was deleting/disputing what is, after a fair amount of reading, a perfectly fair statement. You consistently say 'some people disagree' or 'read this single baised source I like', but won't respond to the arguments I (or anyone else, it seems) put forward to support our argument. That is not sufficient reason for the changes you make/desire to be made actually occurring, and it would be a terrible shame for such a good source to lose integrity through someone unjustifiably tampering with definitions for what appear to be personal preference reasons. -- ConcretePeanut 17:23, 14 March 2006 (GMT)</dd>

<dd><i>"If you look carefully at the reason many people dispute a-c's validity it isn't on what are claimed to be anarchistic/liberty principles"</i> - that's not true.

<p>Those criticisms could be levelled at any socialist or communist form, too. A freedom to partake in a free market if one so wishes is part of having true liberty. Do you dispute the fact that these leads to the conclusion that a system which allows that choice is freer than one which doesn't? If you do dispute it then I'd be <i>really</i> interested in seeing the reasoning behind your argument. If you don't then I can't see how you can defend your position with coherent arguments.</p>
<p>It also ignores the fact that heirarchy is not only natural but unavoidable to some extent in any society, be it in the form of an oppressive state that is clearly divided from society, or as the inherent superiority over the opposition that will be found in any clear majority or vastly better equipped minority. Of course an anarchistic system wants to remove implicit control and any authoritarian structure, right? So it would seem the ultimate anarchistic society would be where people could choose to live in commune or to partake in a free-market economy as individuals or groups, so long as they don't impinge the freedom of others to choose otherwise.</p>
<p>The article in question here (surprisingly...) is the one that would lose integrity if it were to fall into the same trap as many other anarchist resources by being taken over by strong leftwing politics, thus becoming terribly biased and less useful and respectable than they otherwise would have been. If you want a discussion on etymology or linguistic definition then I suggest you go elsewhere, as it isn't relevant to this discussion unless you happen to be working from an entirely different set of language assumptions and rules than everyone else.</p>

<p>And Big Brother is one of the most watched programs on television - what is your point? The fact is I've given examples of how it contradicts itself or common sense quite clearly (equality being compatible with slavery being just one of the more stupid examples). Popularity does not insure accuracy, and if you are going to cling so to a source simply because some people like it (and perhaps you should think why that is - to support their own ideas, despite the incoherence of them) then you are liable to remain incorrect on various matters. Without trying to sound rude, you come across as quite young, and perhaps a tad idealised. You will find, though, as you progress through education/work that relying on one source simply because you like it is a terrible mistake, and that sources that are clearly biased are also often highly dubious in usefulness 'across the board', as it were.</p>
<p>So, the facts that do speak for themselves are that despite your appeal to popularity/majority opinion for the site (or perhaps it's own) the site contains contradictory/nonsense information, and is clearly heavily left-wing biased. I suggest reading some books on political ideologies not written by the theorists in an area but analysing an ideology or school of thought, as they are extremely useful for highlighting logical inconsistencies within the orginal outline or suggestions, rather than sites that clearly have an agenda to support. When I've sorted out the tip in my room I'll try and dig out a couple of the better ones to suggest, if you're interested. -- ConcretePeanut 22:42, 14 March 2006 (GMT)</p>

<dd>The AFAQ implies that equality is compatible with slavery, as I have shown with a quote (which I shall give here <i>again</i> for clarity): "Liberty without equality is only liberty for the powerful, and <b>equality without liberty is impossible and a justification for slavery</b>." (emphasis mine). If you can see some way in which saying that 1) something that <i>is</i> equal can also 2) be a justification for slavery <i>doesn't</i> justify slavery then I will retract my claim, but until then my point stands entirely reasonably. I'm not hell-bent on discrediting the source, as there seems to be much useful information there. However, any unbiased source would say that yes, there are those who claim a-c isn't anarchism, but that none of the arguments are conclusive and there isn't any other area of definition that it would fit under. It would also, of course, not make blundering and verifiably false or nonsensical statements such as the one quoted. I don't see how I could possibly have developed an inherent hatred for something that until you linked me to it I'd never come across before. No distortion of words is necessary, but if you need the above explanation for why the quote implies what I claim it implies I will be happy to provide it.</dd>

<p>Okay, here goes the reasoning for that -</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"equality without liberty is impossible and a justification for slavery" if broken down forms 2 explicit claims, firstly that <i>equality without liberty is impossible</i>, which alone would say that you cannot be equal without being free. It doesn't say what level of freedom is required to make it impossible, or what level of equality is prevented when this level is not achieved, so let us assume that it means when the amount of freedom being restricted outweighs the practical equality evident in society, equality is in effect non-existent. Anything less than such would be 'fairly equal' or 'free-ish' (bearing in mind that total freedom in any society is impossible and that true equality can only come around through being given choices and the freedom to act on them, not through coercive efforts to 'level the playing field' and forced choice).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So, if part one says that without a certain level of freedom you cannot have equality, what does this mean for part two, which states that <i>in combination</i> (not either/or, but 'and') with this, not only is equality without a set degree of freedom (whatever level, but as defined above for the sake of this argument), but it is also a justification for slavery. Here we have a claim which goes "Equality can't occur without liberty, but if it did it would justify slavery". This means either the statement is meaningless (this will never happen but if it does we can blindly guess that X might happen) or that 'equality' as defined by the writer is considered itself to be meaningless unless you have the freedom to exercise it to it's fullest potential (which I'm sure you'd agree is the most likely standpoint for any form of anarchist or libertarian to take on the matter). However, if being equal means all have the same potential choices and are treated the same, how can this ever - impossible or not due to restriction of freedom by the state (although you could potentially have a system without a state where individuals restrict one another in equal ways - I'm not really buying the equality requires total automnity) - that can never be said to justify slavery.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If anything, the quote should be reworded to say that "With slavery equality is impossible, and a justification for the restriction of freedom" or even "With slavery freedom is impossible, and a an end to equality". As it stands it at absolute best is meaningless rhetoric that states if something that can't happen happens something else bad will happen - I don't see why the writer would want to do this, to be honest, as it is a waste of time. However, what does seem more likely is that the writer is saying that in a society with a state and a modicum of equality (i.e. the same laws apply to everyone but the state weilds more power than the populace, as in modern western states) not only is it a rather hyperbolic claim, but also a profoundly stupid one, as you cannot reconcile 'equality' with 'slavery' in any context, be it theoretical or otherwise.</dd>

<dd>Any source should strive to be unbiased, and the AFAQ fails miserably in that, being highly biased.

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Right, so 'X without Y is Z' where Z is an impossiblity, and 'Z is a justification for A'? Either equality without liberty is impossible AND a justification for slavery, OR equality without liberty is impossible and that impossible situation would be a justification for slavery. If the latter (assuming it means truly without liberty, rather than with merely limited liberty) then it is an irrelevant statement, if the former then it is saying that in some situations there is something that can be described as equality which can co-exist with slavery.</dd>

<dd>I'm not claiming that any anarcho-capitalist authors are unbiased - where did I state anything of the sort? You can complain this page is biased, but if your justification for doing so is by using a biased source then you have no argument to support you. If you find primary sources that are biased as a reasonable <i>sole supporting source</i> for calling what they are biased against biased a reasonable line of argument then perhaps you may want to reassess your referencing standards. -- ConcretePeanut 21:23, 15 March 2006 (GMT)</dd>

<dd>It doesn't surprise me that a-capitalist criticise it. But since that is the point of the FAQ, it is to be excepted. What would make this FAQ bad would be if they failed in their objectives.

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>No. It's "X without Y is A and B." B is "justification for slavery". The "justification for slavery" applies to "equality without liberty", not "impossible".</dd>

<dl>
<dd>No, I complained this page was biased, THEN included AFAQ as a source to give multiple viewpoints.

</dl>
<p>Right, so "X without Y is A <i>and</i> B". That's fine. However, as A is 'impossible' B is irrelevant - if X without Y was B and was possible then it would be relevant, but in light of X without Y also implying A, which is an exclusive statement precluding any other elements.</p>
<p>Yes, you complained that this page was biased and then justified your position by referencing a single biased source. If you did that in a report, essay, or evaluation you'd be torn apart - it is easy to find things supporting your claims of bias from opposing sources that are themselves biased against that you wish to criticise. It matters not whether it was the reason or the response, it still fails to meet the requirements for justifiably supporting your claims, and as such they remain just that - unsupported claims. -- ConcretePeanut 21:58, 15 March 2006 (GMT)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You cannot have true X without Y, but some people may use "X without Y" to justify slavery.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Of course I did. Biased means from one point of view only. So I provided an source with the opposite view, justifying my claim that the page is biased, since the page did not contain that opposite view, but instead stated the first view as a fact. -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfinity0_7a16.html" title="User:Infinity0"><span style="color:red;">infinity</span></a><b><a href="../../../i/n/f/User_talk%7EInfinity0_df0a.html" title="User talk:Infinity0"><span style="color:red;">0</span></a></b> 22:05, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Either people are equal or they aren't though - you can't be 'a bit equal'. Within reasonable definitions of equality, if there is not a reasonable level of liberty (X without Y) you <i>can</i> justify slavery is an entirely different claim to "if not Y then X is impossible, so Z" as it implies that you could have an equal society without freedom but with slavery. If you want to put it clearly (which you must in political ideological debate, otherwise people will jump all over your theory) it should say something along the lines of "If you wish to have as unequal a society as possible you must have as free a society as possible, as without such you may end up facing slavery and oppression". This - as I hope you can clearly see - is entirely different in tone and jist to "Equality without liberty is impossible, and a justification for slavery".</dd>

<dd>Biased means not only from one point of view only, but misrepresentative of an objective look at the whole picture. Using biased sources to support an argument is not a wise move. I can't understand why or how you can think it is. -- ConcretePeanut 01:18, 16 March 2006 (GMT)</dd>

<dd>Look, ConcretePeanut, you're being obtuse. It's well known (by capitalist libertarians, among others) that phoney pleas for "equality" under a statist order have been used to justify appalling forms of totalitarianism, up to and including the literal slavery of the gulag. The folks making these pleas claimed that "equality" could come about through totalitarian statist control and massive expropriation from, among others, innocent workers. Thus "equality" was used as an excuse for slavery. But what happened was not in fact equality in any genuine sense of the word (since genuine equality requires liberty). So it was used as an excuse while the people using it as an excuse made its real implementation impossible. This seems a rather straightforward reading of the point that the AFAQ authors were trying to make.</dd>

<dd>Point taken, but considering this is an article about anarcho-capitalism surely the minority view is that being represented, so in the area under discussion it isn't really a minority opinion at all (in the same way as, for example, a discussion about the political importance of Portugal would represent the thoughts and forces within that area, as opposed to the relatively insignificant scope and importance they'd be assigned in any discussion on world politics in general)? -- ConcretePeanut 02:15, 16 March 2006 (GMT)

<dd>Good points, as well, but I wasn't perhaps clear in indicating that I was referring to anarcho-capitalism's relation to individualist anarchism.

<dd>The Introduction to the Anarchist FAQ does not provide any evidence for the claims that anarcho-capitalism is unheard of outside the Internet. It simply asserts that there aren't many and that they are "irrelevant" offline. (... as opposed to the breathtaking political influence of anarcho-communism or primitivism? Please.) For what it's worth, I found out about anarcho-capitalism first in print before I read about it on the Internet. We could sit around here all day and swap our personal impressions and anecdotes about how many anarcho-capitalist as vs. anti-capitalist anarchists we've met, or heard of, or think that there are, but until there is actually some effort at providing evidence for these claims, I don't think that anyone has a legitimate basis for making appeals to the relative proportions. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadgeek_d92e.html" title="User:Radgeek">Radgeek</a> 01:45, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Indeed! And rather safely. I don't think that anybody has claimed that anarchism is a large movement. It is perhaps growing larger, but it's hard if not impossible to measure. What we can claim, however, is that most anarchists do not call themselves anarcho-capitalists, and that maybe just as many do not consider anarcho-capitalism to be anarchism. --AaronS 16:39, 22 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Aaron - I'd say that in a field as small as anarcho-capitalism all views are going to be minority views. In addition to this I don't think there are many a-capitalists who don't consider themselves ind-anarchists. It would be reasonable, I think, to say that all anarcho-capitalists are individual-anarchists, but not that all individual-anarchists are anarcho-capitalists. From how I've read the article and this argument, it seems to me that it isn't claiming the latter and is in fact pretty clear about the former.
<dl>
<dd>The best you could do is show that anarcho-capitalists consider themselves to be individualist anarchists. That's all. At the same time, you'd also have to show that many anarchists don't consider anarcho-capitalists to be anarchists, and especially that most anarchists don't consider anarcho-capitalists to be individualist anarchists. --AaronS 15:44, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Infinity - the article is about the anarcho-capitalist theory and arguments, right? As this isn't what I would see as a particularly minority view within anarcho-capitalists, in part for the reasons I gave Aaron, I don't think the same issue arises. If this was a general article about anarchism, or even individual-anarchism, I would agree, but it isn't. I would think that most of the main anarcho-capitalist thinkers would class themselves as individual anarchists, even to the point of saying that without a free-market you cannot truly be anarchistic or individual. Other articles state (such as social or communist anarchism) that capitalism is heirarchical and coercive in ways that seem like fact because from that point of view it is generally held to be so. I don't see any different standards being applied here. ConcretePeanut 19:00, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>LOL. Obviously you have not read any of the FAQ - the FAQ tries to represent individualist anarchism and many lesser known schools such as anarcho-primitivism. It's all detailed in the "what types of anarchism are there" section (section B IIRC). If those sections were biased, I would expect criticisms from individualist anarchists or anarcho-primitivists denouncing the FAQ. I have found no such complaints. -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfinity0_7a16.html" title="User:Infinity0"><span style="color:red;">infinity</span></a><b><a href="../../../i/n/f/User_talk%7EInfinity0_df0a.html" title="User talk:Infinity0"><span style="color:red;">0</span></a></b> 13:45, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's because anarchism apart from anarcho-capitalism is anti-capitalistic and pro-socialistic. The FAQ explicitly says that it doesn't represent anarcho-capitalism. The vast majority of anarchism is anti-capitalistic. To say "left-wing" implies there is a significant "right-wing" anarchism to contrast it to. There isn't.

<dd>Dan T, your analogy is flawed. Firstly, most forms of music aren't anti-rap, so you can't write that guide in the first place.

<dd>And from my personal experience not only are most people who've heard of anarchism aware of anarcho-capitalism, but in fact a large portion of them have expressed the same attitude as myself (and various others) regarding the incompatability of anything but a free market with a true anarchistic system, therefore 'preferring' anarcho-capitalism in many cases. You prove nothing - many people will have heard of anarchism - in fact probably most - but that doesn't mean they know a lot about it.

You (claim to have) went around asking people whether they had heard of anarchism, and then whether they had heard of anarcho-capitalism. That is probably the worst bit of research I've ever come across. Were they all politically savvy? There are a huge number of people who know absolutely spit about political ideologies beyond the most broad and common concepts, so are pretty useless in determining whether, amongst people who are by definition highly politicised, a view is prevelant to a particular degree or not.</dd>

<dd>Infinity, a <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binomial_distribution.html" title="Binomial distribution">binomial distribution</a> is a function of two arguments, <i>n</i> (the number of trials) and <i>p</i> (the probability of success). You've made <i>n</i> the number of the "pieces of information" that an arbitrarily selected person knows about anarchism, and you've made <i>p</i> <b>equal to the percentage of anarchists (broadly construed) who are anarcho-capitalists</b>.</dd>
<dd>But both of these involve a crude mistake. <i>n</i> represents arbitrarily selected trials out of a larger population. What's the larger population out of which the <i>n</i> "pieces of information" that the "average person" knows about anarchism are being selected? Is it all the "pieces of information" about anarchism that there are? If so, then you have no right to use the <i>n</i> "pieces of information" that the "average person" knows about anarchism as the first argument to a binomial distribution, because the "pieces of information" that a person knows about anarchism are not <i>randomly selected</i> from the set of all the pieces of information about anarchism that there are. People don't acquire the information they have about anarchism by random selection; they acquire it by learning, and some "pieces of information" (like, say, anarchist opposition to the State as such) are "selected" much more frequently than others (like, say, the details of various ideologies and tendencies within anarchism; that's why the counterexamples that Dtobias and Vision Thing mention turn up). Since there's no random selection, there's no binomial distribution.</dd>
<dd>Further, <i>p</i> is supposed to represent the percentage of the larger population which would count as "success" in the trial; in this case, the percentage of all "pieces of information" about anarchism that would convey knowledge of the existence of anarcho-capitalism. But what is that percentage? You've assumed that it's equal to the percentage of the population of <i>anarchists</i> (broadly construed) who are <i>anarcho-capitalists</i>. But <i>why</i> would you assume that? You've given no justification for this assumption, and in fact it seems like a rather silly one. Since the method you offer for etermining the probability that a given "piece of information" selected randomly (even if they were selected randomly in these "trials," which they're not) will convey knowledge of the existence of anarcho-capitalism is unjustified, so are your calculations of proportion based on it.</dd>

<p><i>"Since there's no random selection, there's no binomial distribution."</i> - for the purposes of being simple, it's a random selection. You think I could calculate the individual circumstances for everyone?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No. What I think is that you don't have a binomial distribution when the selection of trials from the larger population is not made at random. Since people <i>do not acquire pieces of information about anarchism at random</i> (they learn them, and as has been repeatedly pointed out, they tend to learn generalities much more often than they tend to learn details about specific ideological subgroups) you do not have random selection from a larger population. Thus you have no right to make calculations of probability based on a binomial distribution. Period. All of the calculations that follow are, frankly, bullshit, because binomial distributions tell you about the probability of a particular outcome of random selection or successive trials, not the probability of a particular outcome of systematically determined selections. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadgeek_d92e.html" title="User:Radgeek">Radgeek</a> 05:48, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>What's the larger population out of which the</i> n <i>"pieces of information" that the "average person" knows about anarchism are being selected?</i> - The larger population is B. It comes out of the calculations because it is unneeded - I realise I should have explained further - B is chosen so that "1 piece" represents the amount of information a person needs to learn to know what anarcho-capitalism is.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Is B supposed to represent <i>anarchists</i> as a population, or "pieces of information about anarchism"? If it's the former, then "pieces of information" can't be selected out of B, because the element of B are people, not pieces of information. If it's the latter, then you can't approximate the number of <i>anarcho-capitalists</i> in the population of <i>anarchists</i> just by approximating the ratio <i>a</i>, as you try to above, because <i>a</i> is then a ratio of the number of a subset of "pieces of information" to the number of a larger set of "pieces of information," not a ratio of the numbers of people. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadgeek_d92e.html" title="User:Radgeek">Radgeek</a> 05:48, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>"Further,</i> p <i>is supposed to represent the percentage of the larger population which would count as "success" in the trial;"</i> - P is the probability of each individual trial succeeding. The expected value of the distribution is p*n, but since it's a <i>random variable</i> it could very well NOT be p.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No, it couldn't. When the "trials" are selections out of a larger population, with success defined as having trait T and failure defined as not having trait T, the value of <i>p</i> is <i>fixed</i> by the ratio of T-possessors to the total population. You seem to be confusing the number of successful trials in the <i>selection</i> (which is what the binomial distribution is a probability distribution for) with the percentage of the <i>larger population</i> which has the trait that you're testing for. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadgeek_d92e.html" title="User:Radgeek">Radgeek</a> 05:48, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it's silly to suggest that you can quantify "pieces of information" about anarchism in the first place. But supposing that you could somehow, it's unlikely that what most people learn about anarchism has very much to do with what anarchist writers "pump out" from day to day (most of which is theoretical and polemical work that non-anarchists have very little contact with). It's also silly to presume that every "piece of information" about anarchism that an advocate of school X within anarchism "pumps out" would convey knowledge of school X. (Lots of anarcho-capitalists and anti-capitalist anarchists write a lot of words on themes other than just the specific details of their own personal school of anarchism.) <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadgeek_d92e.html" title="User:Radgeek">Radgeek</a> 05:48, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is not a matter of trifling quibbles.

Besides, this is totaly confusing, cuz when you come to the article itself, it is a member of libertarian series, and a mention of the anarchist series is put only in relation to the mention of american individualist anarchism.

<dd>Give it a shot. I don't think it's POV to put an anarcho-capitalist link in. Someone else who tries to monopolize the term might, though. The "libertarian" box in this article and the "anarchism" box for individualist anarchism is just a result of POV warring. Again, communist anarchists want to present the POV that anarcho-capitalism is not anarchism, but they will reluctantly accept that early American individualist anarchism is real anarchism because they were opposed to "capitalism" even though they support private property and trade.

<p>Anarcho-capitalism is not accepted as anarchism by the majority of anarchists - ie. its position in the anarchist movement is disputed.

<dd>Hi. Irrespective of the disputes on whether or not anarcho-capitalism is "really anarchism," the fact remains that there are a lot of anarcho-capitalists out there referring to themselves as anarchists. Someone is an anarchist, or any other type of -ist, when they self-identify as one--<i>not</i> when they pass an ideological purity test created by others who identify as members of the same group. Attempts to exclude anarcho-capitalists from the various traditions of anarchism is a pretty clear example of the <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_true_Scotsman_3eed.html" title="No true Scotsman">No True Scotsman</a> fallacy.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Think about it. Which is more encyclopedic--anarcho-capitalism listed as part of the anarchism series, along with the very relevant fact that their status as 'true' anarchists is considered controversial by other anarchists? Or having it arbitrarily exlcluded from the list without explanation? One choice is a balancing attempt to broaden the reader's perspective, and another is POV-pushing attempt to narrow it. <a href="../../../r/e/h/User%7ERehpotsirhc_d5d1.html" title="User:Rehpotsirhc">rehpotsirhc</a> 18:16, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

OK, but you don't give sources detailing the opposite claim. I haven't found secondary claims saying anarcho-capitalism is popular, or even a significant minority amongst anarchists. I have found secondary claims saying anarcho-capitalism is minor. We both know, however, that a-c's position within anarchism is very heavily disputed; much more so than the other schools. For that reason, it shouldn't go on the template. -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfinity0_7a16.html" title="User:Infinity0"><span style="color:red;">infinity</span></a><b><a href="../../../i/n/f/User_talk%7EInfinity0_df0a.html" title="User talk:Infinity0"><span style="color:red;">0</span></a></b> 20:16, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

For example, despite a popular claim that socialism and anarchism have been inextricably linked since the inception of the anarchist movement, many 19th-century anarchists, not only Americans such as Tucker and Spooner, but even Europeans like Proudhon, were ardently in favor of private property (merely believing that some existing sorts of property were illegitimate, without opposing private property as such)."</i> <a href="http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/anarfaq.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/anarfaq.htm" rel="nofollow">An Anarchist Theory FAQ, Dr. Bryan Caplan, George Mason University</a></li>

<dd>That's not saying that anarcho-capitalism is not a form of anarchism. If you look at the fuller quote, he's obviously talking about state capitalist libertarians: "<i>It is time that anarchists recognise the valuable contributions of . . . individualist anarchist theory and take advantage of its ideas. It would be both futile and criminal to leave it to the capitalist libertarians, whose claims on Tucker and the others can be made only by ignoring the violent opposition they had to capitalist exploitation and monopolistic 'free enterprise' supported by the state.</i>" Anarcho-capitalists oppose "monopolisitc 'free enterprise' supported by the state." Nevertheless, Baker is obviously anti-capitalist so he's not a good source anyway. Morover, why is Baker notable? It's not even a book that he's written that this is quoted from.

<p>"There are several recognized varieties of anarchism, among them: individualistic anarchisms, anarcho-capitalisms, anarcho-communisms, mutualisms, anarcho-syndicalisms, libertarian socialisms, social anarchisms, and now econ-anarchisms...major bifurcation between European anarchisms, which tend to be socially-oriented, and American anarchisms, which are typically highly individualistic....Those with stronger individualistic component will tend to rely not merely upon market or allied exchange arrangements, but upon capitalisitic organization; thus anarcho-capitalism..."

<li>ACs reject "the possibility of a constitutionally limited government" (now <b>there</b> is a collectivist concept) not out of negligence but on the empirical grounds that no government has long remained within its constitutional limits, and there are both theoretical reasons (<a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_choice.html" title="Public choice">public choice</a> economics) and empirical reasons (analogy with various private institutions) for supposing that stateless institutions could keep the peace with significantly less risk of encouraging rent-seeking lawlessness.</li>

<p>RJII argues "<i>can't say all ancaps are for law to be market supplied. friedman is for that, but not rothbard</i>" I'm not sure. Are you sure that Rothbard is against that?

<dd>Rothbard supports contract law, of course. But,he believes in inviolable natural law, whereas Friedman believes in all law being the product of the market. So, a law that that wins out in the market may conflict with Rothabard's natural law (that law being a prohibition against force and fraud, and property created through labor). I'm not an expert on the difference. But, that's how I understand it. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 03:06, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, look at Friedman's definition of coercion: "I defined 'coercion', for the purposes of this definition, as the violation of what people in a particular society believe to be the rights of individuals with respect to other individuals." (<i>Machinery of Freedom</i>) Whatever they decide is going to be "coercion" is going to be coercion. If they decide that initiation of force is ok in some cases, then that case is just excluded from their definition of coercion. So, it's pretty clear that Friedman's and Rothbard's anarcho-capitalism can conflict in practice isn't it? Also, this points out a problem with this article. It seems to assume that all anarcho-capitalism is Rothbardian anarcho-capitalism. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 03:54, 1 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't think they really conflict. Friedman, in that quotation, might give the impression that he is okay with whatever people in a given society want to do, but his exposition of his ideas elsewhere shows that he has a lot of pretty clear ideas about what that is or ought to be: he believes in property rights, the wrongness of murder, etc.; basically all that good stuff that Rothbard believes in. Rothbard does believe in a natural law, but, of course, he doesn't expect people to follow a natural law that they themselves don't believe in. So, as far as any society where anarcho-capitalism actually prevails, I think the Friedmanian vision and the Rothbardian are basically the same.</dd>
<dd>In my experience some of the Rothbardian think there is a conflict between Rothbard and Friedman, but Friedman does not. - <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Krause</a><sup>(<a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">Talk!</a>)</sup> 04:03, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So libertarianism is to him a political philosophy per se. It should be "political" "that individuals should be free to do whatever they wish" (see intro <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarianism.html" title="Libertarianism">libertarianism</a>). In a plural grasp it may be correct. People call that <i>political individualism</i>. But <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarianism.html" title="Libertarianism">libertarianism</a> doesn't address this plural per se. There is not even an empirical manifestation in common science or linguistic usage (see google:"anarcho-capitalism is a political")</p>
<p>It is a political need of democrats to value all and anything as political and to enforce their POV by votes. This is truth. --<a href="../../../i/r/g/User%7EIrgendwer_941b.html" title="User:Irgendwer">Irgendwer</a> 09:39, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>By the way, Classical Anarchism has actually some collectively enforced rules against profit, rent, interest or capitalism.

<p>The opinion that the political sector ought to be minimized is a political opinion – or, at the very least, an opinion with potential effects on politics. I think I understand the theoretical point that Irgendwer is making, but removing a-c from the political Categories means that people looking there for the range of relevant opinions are deprived of an opportunity to learn that a-c exists.

<dd><i>What is anarchism without the goal of eliminating the state?</i> Ancaps don't want to take the state away from you because it is no collectivist ideology.

<dd>Many states have fallen, and yet statism remains. If you use force against the state, your force has a political effect whether or not you call it politics.

<dd>Of course statism remained in the form you may see it. Anyhow, modern statism is a very young formation in human history and it is not unlikely that it will change as fast as it had come into existence. But this is far from the point here. You are fudging a story (like RJII above) that anarcho-capitalism must have a theory to eliminate the state by force. I am quite more familiar with anarcho-capitalism than you but this would be new to me. However, you may read Rothbard's books. These are all online.

<dd>I never said that "anarcho-capitalism must have a theory to eliminate the state by force." Some might advocate force, and some might advocate convincing people through philosophy. Some might even advocating moving away from the state to another location to set up a society. But, in all these cases there is a criticism of the state intervening in private affairs. That makes it a political philosophy. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 17:35, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>In short the message is:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The anarcho-capitalists would also entrust to the free market the usual functions justifying the existence of the State i.e. defence and the administration of justice and they propose a system of protection agencies in competition with one another in the same territory. The non-anarchists find it necessary to preserve the State’s monopoly on the exercise of force and the administration of justice. In the opinion of the anarcho-capitalists, the State is an immoral institution because, with its countless monopolies, it tramples on the rights of individuals and is also an inefficient institution for the supply of goods and services. For this reason, they propose a scenario of small communities based on consent which would go beyond the idea of State and nation based on the concept of the monopolistic control of the exercise of force in a given territory."</dd>

<p>Rothbard founded in his book <i>The Ethics of Liberty</i> a theory of natural laws to define a "philosophy of liberty". He saw that political philosophy fails to induce liberty itself, so he started an new idea of what political theory should be to fulfill this task.</p>
<p>I think this is an honest valuation. One should not peg all as political philosophy solely due to some excursions. It is for my taste rather critique of ideology, or sociology. --<a href="../../../i/r/g/User%7EIrgendwer_941b.html" title="User:Irgendwer">Irgendwer</a> 09:48, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For one the Somalia section is totally unencyclopedic. The section is essayistic, written from the standpoint of addressing the question of the degree to which contemporary Somalia is a case of "anarcho-capitalism." While it includes citations, the section falls into the original research realm: The question is why are we even looking at Somalia-- one of over two hundred countries on earth? The answer, I hope, is that at least one "anarcho-capitalist" activist has written an article about Somalia. If so, the identity of that writer should be made clear. If not, then the section is totally idiosyncratic original research POV. In addition to that section, there are many other portions of the article implicitly written from the "anarcho-capitalist" POV, which I will expound on later. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 08:31, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">FAC Removal</span></h2>
<p>This article does not currently, and has not in the past, met the requirements to be a featured article. It has only maintained this status due to the continued lobbying by a handful of editors sympathetic to the ideology.</p>
<ul>
<li>The somalia section is really only one part of the problem, and the only defense of that section "I looked at the section on Somalia and I can't say it's terribly well written—some statements are redundant and repetitive—but I didn't see anything badly wrong with it." by Nat Krause basically admits that the article fails at least the criteria of being "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_is_a_featured_article%3F" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_is_a_featured_article%3F" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> (a) "well written" means that the prose is compelling, even brilliant"</li>

<p>FAC status is not for nifty articles, it is for the absolute best articles on wikipedia.</p>
<ul>
<li>This article uses original research in the form of speculation, "However, Marshall <b>may have</b> overlooked that the most noted individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker explicitly supports the right to inequality in wealth and upholds it as the natural result of liberty,"</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, the fact that Tucker supports the right to inequality is referenced, are you asking that a reference be given to the fact that Marshal over looked, or at least omited mention of this? Two-Bit Sprite 01:29, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>speaks in the subjective voice of its own editors, "The similarity to anarcho-capitalism in regard to private defense of liberty and property is <b>probably</b> best seen in a quote by 19th-century individualist anarchist Victor Yarros:",</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This is just nit picking. The sentence would have too much of an authorative tone without the "probably", and being as which quote <i>is</i> the best example of the similarity between anarcho-capitalism and individualist anarchism is yet to be known, we are left with (extremely minor) speculation on a subjective matter.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">POV in Dispute over the name "anarchism"</span></h2>
<p>The sentence <i>Whether anarcho-capitalism is a true form of anarchism may depend on the meaning of the words "anarchism" and "capitalism".</i> may not be POV, but it is an awful way to start the section on the dispute. It posits the existence one <i>true form of anarchism</i> as somehow better than untrue forms, it weasels around the issue by saying "may depend", and it implies One True Definition for "anarchism" and "capitalism". The second sentence is a much more clear statement of the dispute. It says there's a dispute, and it very succinctly sums up the primary logic behind the claim that anarcho-capitalism is not truly anarchist. <b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Argyriou</a> 15:38, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</b></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Individualist anarchism" label</span></h2>
<p>This discussion happened a while ago, and it ended with most of the disputants giving up and reluctantly accepting <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a>'s Ralph Raico source. This, however, is the only source provided; further, it is not clear that the source substantiates the claim that "individualist anarchism" is even <i>sometimes</i> used. I don't think that this term should be in the infobox, although I think that it would perhaps be worthy of a brief discussion in the article. If it were to remain in the infobox, I think that it should be qualified with a "(disputed)" label. --AaronS 16:23, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

In any case, the box is only claiming the that terms is frequently <i>used</i>, not that such a term is <i>appropriate</i>. And the fact that people, ancap and otherwise, do use the term for anarcho-capitalism is <i>not</i> disputed, so I don't see the reason for marking it that way. <a href="../../../m/r/v/User%7EMrVoluntarist_23fd.html" title="User:MrVoluntarist">MrVoluntarist</a> 20:33, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>None of those really pass the muster of a <a href="../../../r/e/l/WP%7EReliable_sources_20af.html" title="WP:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a> test. You are right, however, to point out that we're simply talking about use, not appropriateness.

<dd>Of course it's necessary to point out alternate terms, unless you want to have an article for each of those different terms, and not have them link each other.

<dd>I recall an earlier version of the box that listed some of them as also having been used to refer to indvidualist anarchism. If you want to state that before such terms are used ("The following terms can also refer to <a href="../../../i/n/d/Individualist_anarchism.html" title="Individualist anarchism">individualist anarchism</a>:" -- and yes, "individualist anarchism" would be in that list), I have no objection.

It's amusing that you're bringing up all of these instances that really should be embarrassing for you. After all, if you remember, you said that "flat-footed" refers only to the anatomical condition. I took great pleasure in educating such a very wise man as yourself when I reminded you that it can also <a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/flat-footed" class="external text" title="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/flat-footed" rel="nofollow">mean</a> "proceeding in a plodding or unimaginative way" or "pedestrian."

I'm referring to your use of "pedantic" on the Flag message boards in December 2002. (Good memory, not good record-keeping or obsession.) I may have been Kevehs though, I forget.

<dd>No, what is insane is the illogical baselessness of your accusations, your oversensitivity, and your obsessive infatuation with me, all of which could be regarded as symptoms of anti-social behavior. From this point on, I'm not going to bother indulging you in these silly little conversations. While I do enjoy exercising my wit now and then, this is not the place for it, and I would like to adhere to the policy of this web site. So, you can continue to call me a liar, accuse me of raping babies, and haunt my every move on Wikipedia.

<dl>
<dd>Aaron: you did lie. That is unambiguous. In the post you are referring to, I suggested one (sort of) reasonable meaning of "flat-footed" you could have meant, and then, separately, suggested the anatomical use. You clearly stated that I said it could only mean the anatomical use. You lied. There's no wiggle room on this one, I'm afraid. You also made a gratuitous reference to me (the sarcastic remark about my intelligence). There was no reason for it to be there. It made no sense in the context of your post. It was a cheap shot at me. Perhaps you think it's mature to dismiss any criticism of your behavior as "anti-social", but it's not.

I've also tried to trim the over-bloated first paragraph by removing redundancy; as I read the old version, it seemed to say that they rejected the state something like four times, and repeatedly detailed the fact that they want the free market to handle the defense of individual liberty and property against aggressors. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 16:44, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

I'm not in the habit of <i>only</i> removing uncited or uncontroversial claims. Some sentences (or paragraphs) are just fluff, aren't exactly necessary for the article, are redundant, etc. (you'll see this in my edit summary, where I explain that I'm trying to cut the article length). What I cut was a bit redundant, since anarcho-capitalist economics are already explained in detail in the article. But who knows, maybe I'm lying and I don't even know it. --AaronS 15:29, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Vision Thing, I would appreciate if you explained to me why you reverted some of my changes. The article is quickly approaching 60KB again. I thought that most of my cutting involved non-essential stuff or theoretical speculation. --AaronS 14:08, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I went ahead and put back some of my previously reverted edits. Here's why:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the contractual society section, it is not clear that the particulars of such a society are difficult to determine <i>because</i> it is contractual. My version is more succinct and does not make that unverified claim.</li>
<li>That anarcho-capitalists maintain that the social structure of a contractual society would be self-regulating is unverified theoretical speculation, and therefore does not belong in the article.</li>
<li>"As to the question of law itself, various anarcho-capitalists have different solutions." This statement is entirely unnecessary.</li>
<li>All of the things I preened from the "use of force" section were unverified bits of theoretical speculation; please do not put them back, fact tags and all.</li>
<li>The semantic dispute is largely dubious, unverified, and mainly the result of the original research produced by the University of <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> and <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a>.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">article significance?</span></h2>
<p>Where do Nwe, AaronS, and The Ungovernable Force get some sort of arrogant right to judge the significance of this article? If you all have some special degree in the study of anarchism I would kindly like to see it now. I find your attacks on several editors here highly offensive and insulting in the extreme. If Hogeye, RJll and Vision Thing have all graduated from the same university than you can bet I did, too. And Nwe, you said, "anarcho-capitalism is not real anarchism". If you are a so called communist-anarchist or (socialist liberal), I believe you have some serious explaining to do. Because there is no such thing as <i>communist anarchy</i>. Like I said before you may as well say monarchist anarchy or fascist anarchy. That's how impossible such a thing is.</p>
<p>Capitalism is not a form of <i>government'</i> it just a system that allows individuals to trade freely. In an anarchy, by definition there is no government, it would happen because people would naturally want to sell goods sometimes and no government would exist to stop them.</p>
<p>Communism is a form of government, or more accurately a <a href="../../../s/t/a/State.html" title="State">state</a>. Maybe one of you would be so kind as to explain to me how a state and anarchy (lack of state or head or ruler or government) could exist together at the same time.</p>
<p>If at least one of you can't respond to these questions with some reasonable answers I will assume that you should not be editing this article because you can't back up your assertions with fact. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELingeron_802e.html" title="User:Lingeron"><font color="#003366" face="Verdana">Sha</font></a><font color="#006666" face="Veranda">nnon</font><sup><a href="../../../l/i/n/User_talk%7ELingeron_ee69.html" title="User talk:Lingeron"><font color="#3906A2">duck talk</font></a></sup> 02:11, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Huh...? --AaronS 02:34, 18 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, I've got to agree with Aaron. But I have to ask, where did you learn about communism and anarchism? I can assure you that communism is much more than just a government owning the economy. That is one form of communism (albeit the most commonly understood and talked about form), but definitely not the only form. You seem to be uninformed as to what communism and anarchism mean historically in terms of actual social movements and philosophies, other than the basic "communism means government owns everything and anarchism means no government". That's how I thought in junior high, but after only a week of looking into actual anarchist philosophers and such, it became pretty apparent that that position was incredibly destitute. Look in a print encyclopedia on anarchism for one. Anarchism is about dismantling social hierarchy, <i>including</i> but not limited to governement. For most if not all anarchists (depending on who you talk to), this also includes economic inequality, in other words, creating a classless society where all individuals have control over the means of production (sounds sorta like communism, huh?). If anarchism merely meant no government, than anarchism really would just mean chaos. We could say that any time a government stopped functioning and everyone began killing and robbing each other, it would be an anarchist society. That simply is not the case though, as I'm sure you would agree. There is more to anarchism than just no governemnt. And since when has no government inherently implied free-market capitalism as you seem to say it does? Many people (such as myself) would rather give things away to people who need them and have the receiver reciprocate in kind when the original givers in need without any formalized trade system in place (see <a href="../../../r/e/c/Reciprocity_%28cultural_anthropology%29.html" title="Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)">Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)</a>, especially the part about generalized reciprocity, as well as <a href="../../../g/i/f/Gift_economy.html" title="Gift economy">Gift economy</a> which specifically mentions anarcho-communism). As Marx said "from each according to ability, to each according to need". There is nothing that implies governance in that statement, yet it's the essense of communism. This is neither selling of goods on a market or a planned economy.</dd>

<dd>And as for RJII, I don't think there is any way to defend a user who admits that their sole purpose was to insert their POV into all of wikipedia and do so through dirty tactics that ammount to psychological warfare. And Hogeye makes numerous personal attacks against other users which is completely unacceptable. <font color="black"><b>The</b></font> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="green"><b>Ungovernable</b></font></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_6a81.html" title="User talk:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="black"><b>Force</b></font></a> 03:07, 18 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>RJII may think that he had waged psychological warfare against some of us, but I think that he might have been his only victim. To be that emotionally and psychologically caught up in this web site is diagnosable at best. Throw in a grandiose sense of self, a belief in the Truth with a capital T, and a fervent faith in one's own calling to spread that word, and we just might have the next Prophet. Regardless, I don't think that Wikipedia is the place for this kind of theoretical discussion. Anarcho-capitalism is significant in itself, even though it might not be as significant within the context of anarchism. --AaronS 03:15, 18 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Again, I agree. First off, I don't understand why you took to attacking us all here like you just did Shannon since Aaron and I were both saying that the fact that this article is longer than "anarchism" doesn't matter much. We never suggested that it be gotten rid of or anything like that. It is a significant idea that deserves mention, I'm just saying that I don't think it's a form of anarchism. It has elements of it, but it is much closer to American Libertarianism than classic anarchism. As for RJII, I think the saddest part about his attempt to wage psychological warfare was how painfully obvious it was that he was trying to do it. <font color="black"><b>The</b></font> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="green"><b>Ungovernable</b></font></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_6a81.html" title="User talk:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="black"><b>Force</b></font></a> 03:22, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">back to reality</span></h2>
<p>I did not attack you, Ungoveranable force. I was merely defending the attacks on this excellent and well-rounded article.</p>
<p>Since your memories are so short here are two quotes (directly above):</p>
<p><i>I've noticed that this article is much longer than the article on <b>real anarchism</b>. This is completely disproportionate to the popularity, historical importance and philosophical legitimacy of the two movements. Either someone can write another 1,500 words on anarchism, or as I'd prefer, this article should be severely cut. --Nwe? 16:57, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</i></p>
<p>I find the term 'real anarchism' a joke at best. I wouldn't describe myself as a communist or an anarcho-capitalist, although according to the article there are a number of schools of thought this philosphy. The classical liberal, libertarian one would what I would be.</p>
<p><i>There is no policy on article length being in proportion to <b>significance</b>. If there is relevant information about a subject, it should be included. See ninjas versus pirates. --AaronS 15:01, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</i></p>
<p>Uh, making disparaging remarks about the significance of an unusually good article and comparing it to <a href="../../../n/i/n/Ninjas_versus_pirates.html" title="Ninjas versus pirates">ninjas versus pirates</a> would be considered real insulting in most circles.</p>
<p>Now you have insulted my intelligence and the depth of my knowledge, by comparing my statement to your understanding of anarchy when you were in Junior High. I probably had more insight and understanding of the hypocracy and sameness of the left and the right and of communism and fascism and socialism and all the other forms of government, and political parties by the time I was in third grade than most people will ever have.</p>
<p>Don't state what my understanding of anarchy is for I haven't told you that. I was just trying to simplify something that you apparantly have no understanding of.</p>
<p>My understanding, number one, is that anarchy means freedom. If there ever was a society that had little, if any, government intervention it was the pioneers in the mid to late 19th century. Guess what? They shared what they had freely with each other. They helped each other when it was time to raise a barn or harvest a crop. In the plains and on the farms there was no need for cops or petty tyrannical laws or <b>any</b> interference at all. And guess what? The large majority of these poor, hard working, but free people were either Christian or Deist.</p>
<p>I have read (albeit) a little of Marxs' writing and what I honestly saw was a ridulous twisting of the works and writings of Paine and Jefferson. Also anyone who can say that "the state will eventually wither away" should find another hobby, besides the further screwing of the hope of a free government (Paine and Jefferson, the United States which the federalists destroyed). <b>States</b>, my fine people, <b>do not just wither away.</b> <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELingeron_802e.html" title="User:Lingeron"><font color="#003366" face="Verdana">Sha</font></a><font color="#006666" face="Veranda">nnon</font><sup><a href="../../../l/i/n/User_talk%7ELingeron_ee69.html" title="User talk:Lingeron"><font color="#3906A2">duck talk</font></a></sup> 04:14, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just as a real important addition, the people who inhabited this great continent before the marauding Europeans arrived and stole their land, lived in <i><b>real anarchy</b></i>. And you know what? I bet they had more freedom and happiness than all the dreams of all the white folks who pretend to know what anarchy is put together. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELingeron_802e.html" title="User:Lingeron"><font color="#003366" face="Verdana">Sha</font></a><font color="#006666" face="Veranda">nnon</font><sup><a href="../../../l/i/n/User_talk%7ELingeron_ee69.html" title="User talk:Lingeron"><font color="#3906A2">duck talk</font></a></sup> 04:20, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm still confused as to how what I said has any relation whatsover to your claims against me. Perhaps you should reread what you quoted. --AaronS 14:16, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Yeah, and the people who inhabited this continent engaged in warfare with one another at times and some had governements. Others didn't, and many of them had gift economies, at least within their groups. I'm an anthropology major, I know that sort of thing already. That seems like a straw-man argument though.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, you said we believed we had "the arrogant right to judge the significance of the article" and included me in that statement. Then you gave two examples of people supposedly judging the significance article in a way you disagree with, neither of which were from me. And wikipedia is largely about judging significance, that's why we have notablility policies, so what does it matter if they did? Especially when two of us (Aaron and I) were defending the article as it currently is. Where are you getting the idea that we are attacking it?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Third, I'm not trying to insult you intelligence, I'm saying you don't have much knowledge of anarchism as it pertains to the specific philosophy and it's history. You seem to be basing all of this on your own interpretation of anarchy, which could include anything. That's fine for your everyday life, but not for an encyclopedia. By pointing out that that is how I thought in junior high I was showing that I can understand why you think what you do. I've met plenty of people who called themselves anarchists without any real knowledge of what that meant, and I used to be that way many years ago, so I understand where you are coming from, but it is not appropriate for this project. Again, read a non-wiki <a href="http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568770/Anarchism.html" class="external text" title="http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568770/Anarchism.html" rel="nofollow">encyclopedia article</a> on the topic. As for Marx, I agree that states don't whither away, which is why I'm an anarchist and not a Marxist. That doesn't mean he doesn't have a few good ideas. I also find it ironic that you would praise the same settlers who ended up being the final death nail in the lifestyle of the Natives Americans. <font color="black"><b>The</b></font> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="green"><b>Ungovernable</b></font></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_6a81.html" title="User talk:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="black"><b>Force</b></font></a> 04:51, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Okay, now you're really starting to piss me off. First don't patronize me. Two: who the hell are you to judge whether my knowledge is good enough for an enclyclopedia, or even what my knowledge is? Three, at least as far as editing an encyclopedia goes I don't try to push propgagandistic crap down the throats of the article's readers, (e.g. 'communism') throughout an article entitled 'anarchism'. Four: I've seen the way you gather together with other editors to bully other editors (RJll, Hogeye and Vision Thing) for instance and demean what is a better article than you ever likely to write. Please show me where you have written an article that even comes close to the excellence of this one. I see the way you twist people's words, derange the issue at hand, lie and insult people, and purposefully work at confusing an issue. (A very typically socialistic thing to do.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I've seen the way you go running to the admins, (duh, a type of government) to report editors who you deem to be sockpuppets, thereby showing that you haven't got the most rudimentary notion of anarchism. No anarchist would cahort with the powers that be to hurt another editor. Now I suppose you will run to one of the admins and say something like <i>Shannon is an obvious sockpuppet of some banned editor</i>. Or will you just go and complain that I personally attacked you, when in fact it was the other way around? You have no idea how much I am biting my tongue now not to say certain things. (I'll let you guess.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And 5: I don't really give a rat's ass what your sociology books say or what is "considered real anarchy." There's one more thing that I can claim, that you really can't. I have a mind that hasn't been destroyed and rendered disfunctional with the propaganda of others. I can still think. There's sort of an edge in that.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And then, fascinatingly, you still haven't told us what, exactly, <b>communist anarchy</b> is. I'm dying to hear it.

<dd>I feel no need to justify my actions to you, especially based on your last post. I stand by my actions and regret nothing, and you saying I'm not an anarchist isn't going to change that much. I can justify them to myself and that's what matters most. As for what really matters--content, look in an encyclopedia and tell me if you still think presenting anarchism as having things in common with communism is biased. Many encyclopedias barely give mention to an-cap if at all, at least the anarchism article here does so. You can believe what you want about what anarchism <i>really</i> means on your own personal time, but as far as the genuine philosophy and movement is concerned (as interepreted by scholarly sources), you need to lay off. Heck, rant about it, believe it, make a religion out of it, preach on a street corner, create a website, but do <i>not</i> try and present it as the accepted idea of what anarchism is as defined by scholars and the vast majority of self-described anarchists. <font color="black"><b>The</b></font> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="green"><b>Ungovernable</b></font></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_6a81.html" title="User talk:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="black"><b>Force</b></font></a> 20:47, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

The only people who allow any changes to this article are anarcho-capitalists -- the people who, by no fault of their own, are probably the least objective with regard to the article. The whole "culture" on this page, at least with regard to some editors, is an extreme defensive stance against the Communist bogeymen. --AaronS 05:03, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"Wouldn't want to interupt the flow of your advocacy-er, article." That's uncivil. And where on this board did I myself say anything about communist boogeymen? Or are you just overgeneralizing?

<p>I have moved the sections "Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism" and "Criticisms of anarcho-capitalism" down a bit because I don't know of many articles which set a precident for first attacking the subject matter and then describing it in detail later.

<p>Please leave it alone. Although I don't like the way many articles have gone here at Wikipedia, one thing that Wikipedia has remained good at is choosing featured articles. This article has received a featured status for a reason. Vision Thing cautioned me about reverting the vandalism of others by telling me that "reverting is what they want because it will lower the <b>stability</b> of the article." Maybe the kindest thing we can do to this article is leave it alone.</p>
<p>To those who would destroy it: What is your problem? Will you stoop this low to push your dominance over articles and spread your bias? Are you just jealous of this article? Is that why you are playing these horrendous and destructive games with it? Honestly, whatever the reason it crosses the boundaries of all decency..both in an encyclopedia and by any standards, anywhere.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Nifty Boxes</span></h2>
<p>The "as anarcho-capitalists define it" box is currently being used to insert cherry picked and in many cases non-normative anarcho-capitalist definitions into the voice of wikipedia by using these biased definitions to back the words then used to describe anarcho-capitalism in a supposedly neutral article. I intend to remove this box and overhaul the article to indicate when claims concerning such words are being made <i>by anarcho-capitalists</i> rather than <i>by wikipedia</i>. Not doing so would leave this article in violation of NPOV policy and be an on-going clear indication of its failure to meet featured article guidelines.</p>
<p>Second, the "other names anarcho-capitalism goes by" box is yet another attempt to push various anarcho-capitalist use of terminology as they use it into the article. Especially such terms as "free market anarchism" and of course "individualist anarchism" are a violation of NPOV given that they are terms used by other ideologies which conflict with anarcho-capitalism. I have a funny feeling that, given the tone of several editors on this page, folks aren't going to let me remove the box regardless of its clearly misguided focus. However, if the box was made NPOV, to actually present ALL the terms used to refer to anarcho-capitalism as it claims to, I think a lot of those same editors would suddenly be up-in-arms about keeping such terms out. So what should we do, remove the box to change the focus away from describing anarcho-capitalism as anarcho-capitalists describe it, thus retaining neutrality, or import all the terms (with referances of course) that the anarcho-capitalists don't want cluttering up their page, thus retaining neutrality? <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlahblahblahblahblahblah_a472.html" title="User:Blahblahblahblahblahblah">Blahblahblahblahblahblah</a> 11:57, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I do agree that some of the terms are being used a little too loosely, and the article should point out — maybe even put in "scare quotes" — terms that are being used in an ancap sense. This however, is no reason to remove the box outright, just maybe to put a bit more explanation in it and, again, fix the usage in the article to differenciate between common usage and ancapist usage. I'll skim through the article myself and see if I can make some clarifications. Feel free to help me out.</dd>
<dd>As for the "other names" box, I see nothing wrong with it including indy-anarchism. I don't think the followers of Tucker, et al have any special privilage to the terms "individualist" and "anarchist" used in any combination, it is merely a combination of adjectives which also happen to acurately describe the way ancapists feel about thier beliefs. The box already goes further out of its way than I think it should to attempt to appease those who wish to claim ownership of the term. Two-Bit Sprite 12:16, 27 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Shall I take that as a vote for including other terms used to referance anarcho-capitalists in the box, or is this special box reserved to describe only those terms anarcho-capitalists use themselves?</dd>
<dd>I feel the definitions box is entirely redundant to the symbols and definitions article, I see no need for both the box and that article other than to confuse the reader into thinking that the terms used to describe anarcho-capitalism in this article are defined as anarcho-capitalists define the terms in that box. Still, my objection would lessen after a careful combing through of the article, which of course I will join you on, I just wanted to post my intentions here beforehand so that my attempts to improve the article are not continued to be percieved by some parties as "sabotage" and "attacks". <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlahblahblahblahblahblah_a472.html" title="User:Blahblahblahblahblahblah">Blahblahblahblahblahblah</a> 12:36, 27 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The box is for terms which anarcho-capitalists, or those is similar theories have called themselves. It is possible for you to make up random terms (as I assume you are saying you would do) and put them there, but it might be considered vandalism. Please, I don't want to start a sarcasm war on the talk page, I merely expressing my understanding of the intention of the box. As for repetition of information from another article, I would agree with you if full explanations and definitions were repeated between articles, but merely listing them as a side note is not such a bad thing. I think more artilces should follow the format using boxes like this, I think it really helps bring color and structure to the article, esp. for us visual thinkers which like to see things itemized and visually — as opposed to strictly texually — organized. Two-Bit Sprite 12:50, 27 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That is precisely the problem, that the box is being used selectively for terms that anarcho-capitalists or similar (i.e. sympathetic) theories have called themselves. In other words, it is a storehouse of anarcho-capitalist point of view with no counter point being offered. Really it ought to be taken out imho, because it is so problematic, but if it stays I can't see it justified without a balancing of terms. (i.e. what terms are used to refer to anarcho-capitalism, rather than what terms the anarcho-capitalists want people to use to refer to anarcho-capitalism) <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlahblahblahblahblahblah_a472.html" title="User:Blahblahblahblahblahblah">Blahblahblahblahblahblah</a> 15:06, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>From what I can tell this symbol is a creation of the hosts of anarchism.net to identify their site and sell their pins. A google of the image shows it being used by two sources, anarchism.net and wikipedia (and its various mirrors). Unless someone can come up with a reliable source (preferably something published, scholarly, etc) pointing to this as an anarcho-capitalist symbol, I'm thinking an isolated web phenomena isn't enough. I'm removing it pending this support that this is something other than a vanity posting. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlahblahblahblahblahblah_a472.html" title="User:Blahblahblahblahblahblah">Blahblahblahblahblahblah</a> 12:07, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

Per Bylund <a href="http://www.anarchism.net/merchandise.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.anarchism.net/merchandise.htm" rel="nofollow">markets the symbol</a> on his website. Per Bylund posts his "article" about the symbol to anti-state.com, which "publishes" it on their site (though oddly it isn't in their <a href="http://www.anti-state.com/user.php?user_id=32" class="external text" title="http://www.anti-state.com/user.php?user_id=32" rel="nofollow">archives</a> anymore). Some dude named Bjorn posts it to his personal webpage, saying he found it at anarchism.net. This makes it a representation of anarcho-capitalism? I just don't think wikipedia should be used to increase sales over at anarchism.net, and this is clearly a web phenomena. I'm sure if we scour the net we can find people talking about it in some forum or posting it to their personal blog, but doesn't anarcho-capitalism have any... like... more traditional symbols? Maybe something that could be found outside the net somewhere, in a book, refered to by Rothbard or Friedman, anything a bit more solid?</dd>
<dd>Please note that Per is <a href="http://www.perbylund.com/projects.htm#libertatis" class="external text" title="http://www.perbylund.com/projects.htm#libertatis" rel="nofollow">using a wikipedia article</a> to claim that his symbol has "gained recognition worldwide". I can't help but feel there is a clear conflict of interest/bias issue involved in using Per as a source for his own symbol so that he can use wikipedia to refer back to his symbol. Not that I'm not against using the name of anarchism, the symbol of taijitu, and the vehicle of wikipedia to make a quick buck off of engraved pins and lighters.

<dd>I wasn't talking about existence but popularity. If the Karen National Union isn't talked about on the internet then it's not very popular. Anarcho-capitalism is talked about on the internet because it's popular.

<dl>
<dd>That's just false. There are a myriad of people, groups, organizations, events, etc. that are very important, but which are not talked about on the Internet, for any number of reasons. It could be because the event or the person existed long ago, and was important then, but isn't considered important or isn't known about by average people today. On the flip side, there are some very insignificant things that are blown out of proportion by their presence on the Internet, again for any number of reasons. It's called systemic bias. Prevelance on the Internet measures nothing reliably. The Internet is an exclusive communications medium to discuss what some people who have access to it are thinking about in particular parts of the real world. If anarcho-capitalism has a presence on the Internet (the most popular site for anarcho-capitalists, Anti-State.com, which is essentially just a BBS, is ranked at <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?url=www.anti-state.com" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?url=www.anti-state.com" rel="nofollow">240,497</a> by Alexa), then that's it - it has a presence on the Internet. --AaronS 19:58, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You are correct that it reflects the ideas of those who have access to the internet. But most people in the developed world have access to the internet. Having presence on the internet is not simply having presence on the internet. You are forgetting that there are real people using the internet. What is being discussed on the internet is what is interesting to REAL people.

<dd>I'm not saying that there are a lot of anarcho-capitalists on the Internet. I'm saying that there are a few anarcho-capitalist web sites that have some traffic. Anti-state.com only has 1541 members for its BBS, and that's assuming that they're unique and that all of them are anarcho-capitalists (I'm a member, and I'm not). I think that you're failing to get the main point. If a bunch of people only talk about something on the Internet and then don't do anything about it in real life, then it's just an Internet phenomenon. That's why we don't say <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_your_base_are_belong_to_us.html" title="All your base are belong to us">All your base are belong to us</a> swept the <i>world</i> by storm. It swept the Internet. The other part of my main point is that no serious academic, scholar, or researcher would accept your claims. Now, that might not matter to you, but it is important if you want to create a trustworthy source of information. The Internet is no universal measure of significance. It is one measure, and whether or not it is important one is still to be seen, as it is a young one. --AaronS 20:17, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Ok, so essentially what you're saying is that anarcho-capitalism is a philosophical movement. That's a given. Individualist anarchism has always been primarily philosophy. It's just words on paper (and now that there is the internet it's transcribed over to digital format). So as a philosophical movement it's obviously very important as we can see through the proliferation of anarcho-capitalist philosophy. The modus operandi of individualist anarchists has always been to change the world through philosophy, rather than protests and riots. And that's why their writings are more sophisticated and thought-out because they've decided to use persuasion instead of violence. Individualist anarchism is PHILOSOPHY...that's pretty much it. That is, UNTIL individualist anarchism becomes a real social system that society chooses as a result of gradually educating society. That is the whole idea behind individualist anarchism. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheIndividualist_25e6.html" title="User:TheIndividualist">TheIndividualist</a> 20:20, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Anarcho-capitalism IS individualist anarchism. Individualist anarchism is not a precisely defined philosophy. There are various theorists each with their own differences.

If there are a lot of anarcho-capitalists communicating on the internet then there are a lot in the REAL WORLD. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheIndividualist_25e6.html" title="User:TheIndividualist">TheIndividualist</a> 19:09, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>Seriously, though, being web-based is not a measure of non-notability. What's needed is a measure of how broadly something is used (on the web or not). If the symbol is just identified by a single person enterprise on a series of closely-related websites (which may be the case) it isn't notable. If a number of independent groups use it, it's a different story. Basically, can someone come up with at least two usages that is not a) A website maintained by Per Bylund or b) a wikipedia mirror? --<a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESaswann_93bc.html" title="User:Saswann">Saswann</a> 17:16, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>WGee:There's something like 5 or 6 unbanned editors that seem to think that this article does deserve it's featured status. Then there's the 2 banned editors that think the same. (Now up to 8.) My personal take on this ban thing with Hogeye and RJll is that they were harassed by another certain group of editors who did not like their ideologies and set out on a harassment campaign to rid Wikipedia of their pesky selves. After all these two infidels had the unmitigated gall to directly and openly oppose the rule of this (God-appointed) group. Who could blame <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchist_communism.html" title="Anarchist communism">them</a> for their obvious <i>pureness in motivation</i> and for their guarding of the pristineness of Wikipedia. And Wikipedia should, after all, remain a left-leaning encyclopedia! Long live Communism! Love ya, Joey Stalin! And special thanks to that ultimate nitwit, Karl Marx, who gave the world another <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil">evil</a> <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictatorship.html" title="Dictatorship">dictatorial</a> <a href="../../../t/o/t/Totalitarianism.html" title="Totalitarianism">totalitarian</a> <a href="../../../s/t/a/State.html" title="State">state</a> to look forward to.

<dd>Also, it's especially important that enclyclopedias be left-leaning as this is an established tradition. Neutral, factual articles are out of the question.
