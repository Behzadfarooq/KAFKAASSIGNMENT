<p>I suggest that we add that anarcho-communism is basically communism without the transitionary period (AKA socialism). We could add the basic ideas of anarcho-communism (no private property, communually owned means of production, etc.), information about anarcho-communism and human nature, famous examples of anarcho-communism, and famous anarcho-communists. --<a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJremington_72eb.html" title="User:Jremington">Jazz Remington</a> 06:00, 21 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>there are currently three different symbols for anarchist communism. The first one is the red and black flag and the second one is the red and black star. The third symbol is relatively new and is the Red and Anrarchist Action Network (RAAN) and their hammer and sickle A. <a href="http://www.redanarchist.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.redanarchist.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.redanarchist.org/</a></p>

<p>I general hear this called "Anarchist communism" and that phrase does in fact edge "Anarcho-communism" out in Google search results.

<p>Why has someone changed "anarchist communism" to "anarchocommunism" throughout? The article is correctly entitled "anarchist communism". "Anarchocommunism" isn't used by anybody (some people refer to anarchist communism as "anarcho-communism," a usage derivative of "anarcho-syndicalism" which post dates the development of anarchist communism).

<p>Is the communist template really appropriate for this article? The origins of anarcho-communism happened alongside what is considered communism for that template, rather than growing out of it, and had more to do with Proudhon than Marx. In addition, most anarcho-communists are openly hostile to state communism, rather than friendly to it. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 8 July 2005 08:45 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"State communism" is oxymoronic. Anarcho-communists consider themselves communist, and Marxists&#160;!= Communists. Yes, it doesn't have anything to do with Marx in fact, but is still derived from the communist movement. -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 8 July 2005 13:54 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Be that as it may, and I would tend to agree, the current template lists all the following amongst "schools of communism": Marxism · Leninism Trotskyism · Maoism Left Communism Eurocommunism. To my knowledge not a single one of these "schools" is generally considered compatible with anarcho-communism according to anarcho-communists. So while I do understand that anarcho-communism is listed under "related-subjects", because it is a related subject, I don't understand why the anarcho-communism article should dedicate space to two separate templates, one of which is more obviously relevant, and the other which is host to a bunch of movements hostile to anarcho-communism. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 8 July 2005 14:04 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sigh*, reflects something awful I suppose, that the original meaning of communism - anarcho-communism, in terms of minmalised state control and communal living has been lost to the Marxist kind. I do wish to emphasise though that anarcho-communism vehemently considers itself a communist movement (I think), or perhaps I do, because "communist", discounting the social stigma is a rather good word to use in place of "anarchism", which tells of no state, which really isn't descriptive (doesn't distinguish from anomie) - and well...having the "communist template" makes one remind that this is a libertarian socialist movement...emphasis on socialism (which communism is a branch of), emphasis on libertarianism (which anarchism is a branch of) - in my personal opinion, both templates are justified, because both philosophies (which are compatible - liberty and collectivism/socialism) are both vital and fiercely part of anarcho-communism. But it does reflect how foul our Marxist comrades have been. It's like watching your brother or sister become corrupted by drugs until you can't recognise him or her anymore. -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 05:52, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I very much understand where you are coming from. Contrary to most public opinion, I know that all forms of communism do not stem from, nor are they all dependent on, Marxism. I agree with you above that Anarcho-communists are, imho, the only actual form of communist, and that Leninists, Maoists, etc, are little more than capitalists who invest at the state level today with a supposed "vision" of become communists someday. I believe that the best thing to do would be to try to reclaim the word, so that at the very least it does not necessarily entail Marxism. However, atm the article on communism begins with the following sentences, "Modern communism is associated with The Communist Manifesto of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels..." and "Communism is now mainly understood to refer to the political, economic, and social theory of Marxist thinkers, or life in conditions of Communist party rule." These statements are a sad reflection of our historical understanding in modern times, but it is also probably true.</dd>

<dd>I think this situation is very similar to the libertarian page. A word once synonymous with anarchism has now been so far removed from it by the capitalists that the template now only lists movements which advocate capitalism, and the article deals exclusively with the capitalist form of libertarianism and their perspective on the issue. It is an unfortunate distortion of the words anarchists have used to describe their ideals, made all the more frustrating because those very ideals are being used in a crass and opportunistic manenr as a mask to cover true oppression of a kind anarchists have always decried.</dd>

<dd>However, much as I would like to reclaim both words, I would rather see anarchism distanced from both than to see people begin to either equate anarcho-communism with state socialism (as many do now on the libertarian capitalist side of things), or to see people equate anarchism in general with lassez faire capitalism (which is a small but frightening trend). And the sad matter at hand now is that some of the very people who have violently suppressed anarcho-communists and other anarchists in the past are now the ones most closely associated with communism on wikipedia. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 08:37, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>They need some help over there. Apparently some people think that anarcho-communists supports the products of labor as private property rather than collective property. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 05:05, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nobody has made any edits stating that anarcho-communists support the product of their labor as private property. Nor has anyone claimed that anarcho-communists believe that they support any form of private property. The only claims that have been maintained that are relevant to the page is that anarcho-communists sometimes uphold personal possessions as legitimate. The fact that Tucker or Proudhon would have called that private property is not really relevant. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 05:20, 13 July 2005 (UTC)

<p>Kev, why are you deleting some information I put in explaining anarcho-communism? I put in a quote from Cafeiro who was involved with the First International that explains his reasoning for opposing private ownership of the produce of labor. And I put in a quote from Dejaque criticizing Proudhon. Anarcho-communism developed as an explicit rejection of Proudhonism because it support private ownership of produce of labor and exchange markets. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 16:38, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Anarcho-communism is a popular leftist movement which includes aspects of libertarian socialism. Simply clarifying what separates anarcho-communism from libertarian socialism would be a step in the right direction.</p>

ahh!!!!;lkjs;fklsaldfj anarcho-capitalism seems to be a self defeating phrase; let me get this straight- basically, there is no law, but a bunch of people get together willingly and agree on a sort of contract if you will, and this contract says "if you don't pitch in, we'll boot you out" and yet there is no legislation, enforcement of rules/laws (can laws exist in an anarchist state, even on a personal communal level?). But in an anarchic state, natural laws exist, right? so to survive the adversity of others using their freedom to compete with you and your anarchic commune, you must work and compete as a commune to survive. So its kinda like collective darwinism, perhaps?</p>

<p>The introduction blurb needs to be rewritten it seems. The first paragraph does not give a good definition or description of Anarchist-Communism, but rather immediately delves into what it is similar to and what it should not be confused with. I'm not an expert on the topic, but the first thing that struck me about the article is its lack of a clear definition at the very beginning.</p>

<dd>I think all of the information below the first paragraph should be in a section called 'Development and Theory' or something, to neaten up the introduction and the whole article. <b><a href="../../../p/j/b/User%7EPJB_7a17.html" title="User:PJB">P</a>J<a href="../../../p/j/b/User_talk%7EPJB_56e8.html" title="User talk:PJB">B</a></b> 19:49, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Can someone in the know come up with a definitive and concise introductory paragraph? I don't really know anything about this subject, and have only a rudimentary knowledge of anarchism, but found the lead section pretty alienating and wordy, without reaching any kind of definition.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The paragraph mentions the word 'communist' or 'communism' fourteen times, 'anarchism', 'anarchy' or 'anarcho' seven times, 'libertarian' nine times, and 'socialism' three times. This is far too much, bombarding the reader with terms they may not necessarily be familiar with. More importantly though, the lead section only explains what it Anarchist communism <i>is not</i>, rather than what it <i>is</i>.

<p>RadicalMallard, why are you deleting the Criticism section? Those are real criticisms from individualist anarchists. I don't understand your comments about Bryan Caplan and anarcho-capitalism. The individualist anarchists cited are not anarcho-capitalists. And, what does Bryan Caplan have to do with anything?

<p>________ Are you aware of exactly what a NPOV policy is? "Those are real criticisms from individualist anarchists," sounds like these critisms are nothing more than partisan garbage. Please, feel free to rewrite the entire Criticism section from scratch to include your anarcho-capitalist/individualist criticisms, as well as some anarcho-syndicalist, and communistic criticisms. If the Criticism section is to stay, doesn't it need to be fair, and balanced? Honestly, the reason the left can never get anything done is because you all squabble with eachother over the most minor issues! Anarcho-Communism can be almost completely compatible with Anarcho-"Individualism". A place where people work together for the greater good by adding their inputs (specific skill sets) is both communal, and individualist. You're yourself, and that helps everyone, because only you know what you know, and only you can do what you do.</p>
<p>Now, please: Just remove the section for now. Or, at least add some non-partisan critisms. Remember, not all of the people who come to read this article will be Anarcho-ANYTHINGs. They might not know much about Anarchism, or Communism... Why make them feel out of place by introducing a FIGHT into the criticism section? - A Vigilante 64.230.20.73 14:52, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was hoping someone with more knowledge on the subject could elaborate more on the anarcho-communist position on aiding the poor, elderly, disabled, et cetera, and just social programs of that nature in general. How would education be handled (typically) in this type of society? Hospitals? How would these kinds of things be regulated? --Animarxivist 15:24, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Anarchist Communism's position on these topics are relative to the struggle. For example, if there is a struggle for the elderly going on, then we'll join it and try to expose the limits of capitalism and try to facilitate direct action. If there is no struggle going on for the elderly, then we'll use what's called "horizontalism" to link a pre-existing struggle to the need to struggle for the elderly.</p>
<p>I guess the crux of your question is "how would things be regulated?" and the answer is by the working class. The class whose labor is fueling society would be the class who regulates itself in its own interest under a communist society.</p>

<p>Is anarcho-communism against religion like other forms of communism or does it just let you do your own thing? Does it get away from the darwinism that communism has and makes man just an animal?</p>
<p>16:10, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>To my knowledge, the only branch of communist thought that is against religion is Marxism (although there are some schools of Marxism that are more lenient such as Marxist Ecology, Cultural Marxism and Autonomist [Libertarian] Marxism). Marxism was the largest and most popular branch of communist thought, so communism gets the stigma of being "godless". However, Anarchist-Communism is against organized religion as in religious hierarchy and religious rules forced over society, but is not opposed to personal faith. In fact, most Anarchist Communist societies had large religious/spiritual populations and still had churches. There are many faiths and spiritualities were are egalitarian and anti-authoritarian by nature (such as Daoism, Buddhism and some denominations of Western religions). As long as religions do not impose hierarchies over their followers and impose religious laws over society, Anarchist Communists are not opposed to religion although many of us favor personal spirituality over organized religion. In fact, I've heard some anarchists propose the idea of egalitarian "spiritual councils" where people voluntarily gather and discuss spirituality. <a href="../../../f/u/l/User%7EFull_Shunyata_bffa.html" title="User:Full Shunyata">Full Shunyata</a> 10:51, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have recently read guillaume´s work Ideas on Social organization (at the marxists internet archive altough he as no marxist but one of bakunin´s friends and partners in struggle) and it seems that he agrees with the communist principle, only that the implantation of communism must be a gradual unhomogenous and voluntary proccess that should be started whenever possible in each place. it sounds too much like malatesta to me.

No. Anarchist Communists do not share Bob Black's rejection of labor. Any anarchist that accepts that idealistic romanticism is not an anarchist Communist, as the direct appropriation of the means of production and class struggle are the heart of the strain of Anarchist Communism.</p>

<p>Pardon the interruption by an anonymous user (elitest, much?) but: The entire Criticism section seems to be basically a bunch of partisan garbage. In reality, someone who isn't an anarchist, isn't a communist, and isn't an anarcho-communist who comes to this article, and reads that section will just be confused. It's not actualy criticism, and even if it were, it's all anti-the-"communism"-part of anarcho-communism, mostly by anarchists of one form or another who all believe that they are the truest of the true anarchists. I vote that the Criticism section be removed in entirely (at least until there are some proper Criticisms there by others, such as Communists, and even Capitalists). I'd explain further, but I'm sure deep down you all understand my point. NPOV, people!</p>
<p>Also, the symbol (in my own belief, and as I've seen in various protests I've gone to, and voluntary collectivist activities I've been to) for anarcho-communism is a red an black flag. Half red, a diagonal seperator, half black.
