<p>It seems like everyone who has participated recently agrees this is an article with many flaws. However, edit conflicts have erupted over 4 problems: (1) not everyone agrees as to the major flaws, (2) most of the edits have been removals of material rather than constructive additions, (3) there hasnt been much constructive proposing and compromise on the Talk page before making controversial changes, and (4) too much of the arguments have been over tags that are not that important and neither the tags nor the arguments actually improve the article. I propose the following to more efficiently improve the article with a lower level of conflict: (1) unless you can cite a source that it is false, do not remove any material without offering a rewritten version that improves what you find unsatisfactory about the POV or whatever, (2) propose anything more than minor changes here on the talk page first before changing the article, and (3) drop the debate over the tags-- they are not worth the conflict and put here on the talk page are nothing but an expression of an individual's dissatisfaction with the state of the article. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 03:06, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Someone added this little tidbit in on one of the effects. This is utter nonsense. What would steroids produce? "Fake muscles"? Haha. I don't even need to provide sources since the article contains literally dozens refuting this. My IP is currently blocked (I use AOL) so I can't erase that right now.

<dd>Thank you for your explanation. I will try my best to change the article and make it fit the criteria for a nomination.<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidudeman_9722.html" title="User:Wikidudeman">Wikidudeman</a> 02:48, 14 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In my opinion, this article has many good features, but is a very long way from GA. Its most serious problem is its NNPOV, including many phrases like "purveyed in the popular culture and the media." Don't say the media "purveys" (like purveying porn?--a very common usage, hence the NNPOV of purvey), they "report" or "state" or "maintain" etc.<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_L._Peterson_830c.html" title="User:Richard L. Peterson">Rich</a> 06:48, 13 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Looking at what I wrote above, I should have emphasized the NNPOV problem is not just or even mainly wording--It's the insistent effort to downgrade dangers and side effects.--And I'm not saying that the rewards aren't sometimes well worth those side effects. In any case if we strive to be fair and not overpush the safety we won't push the pendulum too far towards deregulation and get a countermovement towards greater regulation. I hope.<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_L._Peterson_830c.html" title="User:Richard L. Peterson">Rich</a> 07:55, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the intro it states <i>Testosterone is the most potent natural anabolic androgenic steroid, while dihydrotestosterone is the most potent natural androgen.</i> this is a bit confusing, do you mean to say that <i>Testosterone is the most potent natural anabolic steroid, while dihydrotestosterone is the most potent natural androgen.</i>&#160;? <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimVickers_d98e.html" title="User:TimVickers">TimVickers</a> 23:50, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I changed it. Testosterone and Dihydortesterone are both androgens. I made it simply say <i>Testosterone is the most potent natural anabolic steroid."<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidudeman_9722.html" title="User:Wikidudeman">Wikidudeman</a> 09:07, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<dd>What it says is "Side effects" it doesn't say "Symptoms". It reads "Anabolic steroids have also been associated with numerous side effects when administered in excessive doses or by those inexperienced and include elevated cholesterol (increase in LDL, decreased HDL levels), acne, elevated blood pressure, hepatotoxicity, and left ventricle morphology." Left ventricle morphology is indeed a side effect.</dd>

<dd>The administration sections is still totally disingenuous. If Wikipedia really believed that you should speak to a doctor before administering steroids, it would not tell you exactly which kind of needle to use and provide links that describe exactly where you should stick yourself. This constitutes medical advice, even if it is prefaced by disclaimer. The potential dangers of people damaging nerves and blood vessels because they read it on Wikipedia prompted me to phrase it in a way that conveys the important modes of steroid administration, without supplying the details that might prompt someone to try it out on himself. --141.154.207.228 04:22, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't believe most of the contributors have ever used anabolic steroids. This article contains only the facts. If you consider those <b>facts</b> to be "pro-aas" then so be it. They are simply the facts. We can not ignore some facts and present others or make up things just to make the article seem more in line with what you hear in the media. That would be un encyclopedic. This article only presents the facts as the scientific consensus determines them. If you believe some of the things in this article are untrue or something was not included then please post that and be very specific so we can determine if it should be changed. But simply saying the article is "pro-aas" because it presents the facts as they are is not constructive to the article.<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidudeman_9722.html" title="User:Wikidudeman">Wikidudeman</a> 02:27, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>These "facts" include (from the article) - "no scientific evidence has shown any long-term serious health defects from correct use of anabolic steroids." I'd like to ask, what is "correct use"? This is completely biased. If this is not bias, then every single drug article (including meth, cocaine, alcohol, etc) should include this sentence of "if used correctly, it has no serious long-term health defects". It seems that, since steroids are such a big $$$ industry for legitamite businesses, that lies and half-truths are constantly said and written about it in all forms of media. <a href="../../../p/e/o/User%7EPeoplesunionpro_57d2.html" title="User:Peoplesunionpro">Peoplesunionpro</a> 02:24, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>When the article says "when used correctly" it means when used in safe dosages and when monitored by a doctor as the studies sourced clearly show.

<dd>I deleted one paragraph because it seems to suggest that "because some teens that commit suicide didnt use steroids, that must mean steroids never are a factor in suicide". And deleted another because it seemed to suggest that "because Ahnold Swarzenegger's heart problem was not caused by steroids, then it is a myth that steroids can cause cardiovascular problems". <a href="../../../p/e/o/User%7EPeoplesunionpro_57d2.html" title="User:Peoplesunionpro">Peoplesunionpro</a> 02:30, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I re-added the paragraphs. Firstly the paragraph relevant to teenage suicide only says that because a teenager committed suicide after using anabolic steroids in no way does it mean the anabolic steroids are responsible. This is a very prevalent myth in the media and popular culture concerning anabolic steroids. If you want to provide a piece in the "side effects" section showing that anabolic steroids can cause suicide that also references peer reviewed scientific studies which are newer than the studies already sourced showing anabolic steroids have no effect on depression then you're free to do so. Just be sure to justify it on the talk page. The Arnold Schwarzenegger paragraph does not imply anabolic steroids can't cause cardiovascular problems. It only implies and CLEARLY SAYS that Arnold's problems aren't due to anabolic steroids. The side effects section clearly shows that it can cause cardiovascular problems when used in unsafe dosages.<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidudeman_9722.html" title="User:Wikidudeman">Wikidudeman</a> 20:03, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I know Wikidudeman is going to hunt me down and kill me for this, but I too still feel the article is a bit bias. I'd stick on a NPOV tag based on this talk page, but it would be removed faster than you could say "roid rage" anyway... It is not about the actual facts in the Popular Misconceptions section, it's about the tone of voice and the choice of given facts. It reads like it's written to convince people that steroids are harmless. It's the way the sentences are formulated.</dd>

<dd>You can't say the article is bias because of it's "tone of voice" because firstly this is text and there is no 'tone of voice' in text. Secondly, Saying the 'tone' of the article suggests bias is incredibly vague and unhelpful. The "popular misconceptions" section is very relevant to the topic considering the prevailing beliefs towards anabolic steroids contain numerous misconceptions which should be rectified. This was done in the <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a> article as well. This article clearly lists and details all of the possible side effects from anabolic steroids from Hepatotoxicity to gingival enlargement. In no way does this article give the impression anabolic steroids are 'harmless' If you have a dispute with the 'tone' of the popular misconceptions section then please explain in detail why you believe it does not adhere to <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>.

<dd>A few quibbles, meant to be constructive. First, the correct adjectival form of the word is "biased". Second, writing certainly does have a "tone of voice"-- our article should be encyclopedic, not reminiscent of the Underground Steroid Handbook. Third, this article is already as tagged as a Bronx subway car and one more will not improve it a bit. Instead, please give us examples of sentences you think are too biased. If you can't suggest a more encyclopedic way to say it perhaps one of us can. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 03:03, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Exactly (and I apologise for my grammar). "Tone of voice" may be an awkward term for typed text, but it's still there. And in this particular article it's so that the addition of a map of Mexico seems a logical next step. Personally I'm mostly concerned about the great number of steroid myth retorts that follow one another as if gathered by Fox News or a team of skilled lawyers. There's also the issue of <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peacock_words.html" title="Peacock words">peacock words</a>. I'll elaborate with a few examples:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>- <b>"but the number <i>seems to be fairly low</i>"</b> (Unencyclopaedic formulation that should be something along the lines of "the precise amount, although difficult to estimate, appears to be below the expectations of.......based on........etc.")</dd>
<dd>- <b>"Since anabolic steroids can be toxic (...), many users <i>consider it ideal</i> to get frequent blood work tests"</b> (Now why does that need to sound so flowery? All that's relevant is that a certain percentage of users get a certain reported average of blood tests.)</dd>
<dd>-<b>"So it is generally considered mandatory for all users to get blood work while using anabolic steroids."</b> (This entire sentence is irrelevant. Unless some important institution or law made it mandatory, this is a conclusion that readers can make for themselves.)</dd>
<dd>-<b>"Arnold Schwarzenegger is the target of yet another myth regarding the purported side effects of anabolic steroids."</b> ("Target"? This word may imply that he was victimised. "Yet another"? Carries emotional baggage. "Purported"? Sounds scoffing. This should be rewritten as something like "Arnold Schwarzenegger has also been subject to rumours regarding the side effects of anabolic steroids". <i>Then</i> it should be explained how this was a myth, but in a "matter of fact" sort of way, not a "prove it, bitches" sort of way.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Furthermore, I personally have a problem with the word "myth" both in this article and others, but that's not something I think a lot of people will agree with. I find it unsuited for an encyclopaedia unless it's covering actual historic mythology. I think that in an effort to remain neutral, the unlikelihood of popular conceptions should be attributed to reliable external sources and nothing more. Let people decide for themselves what they wish to call this. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomsintown_915d.html" title="User:Tomsintown">Tomsintown</a> 11:23, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Concerning the quotes...</p>
<dl>
<dd>-<b>"but the number seems to be fairly low"</b> Why is this not encyclopedic? Encyclopedia articles often address misconceptions and provide the actual facts in relevant subjects. I see no problem here.</dd>
<dd>- <b>"Since anabolic steroids can be toxic (...), many users consider it ideal to get frequent blood work tests"</b> What do you mean by "flowery"? This isn't stating a specific number of users get blood tests. It clearly stats that it's ideal to get a blood test while using AAS to monitor cholesterol levels.</dd>
<dd><b>-"So it is generally considered mandatory for all users to get blood work while using anabolic steroids."</b> Would "ideal" be a better word opposed to "mandatory"?</dd>
<dd><b>-"Arnold Schwarzenegger is the target of yet another myth regarding the purported side effects of anabolic steroids."</b> I changed "target" to say "Subject".</dd>
</dl>
<p>Concerning the word "myth". It's very relevant to this article. One definition of the word 'myth' is "an unproved or false collective belief that is used to justify a social institution." from the Random House Unabridged Dictionary. Going by this definition, the assertions and beliefs that anabolic steroids can shrink testicles, cause brain cancer or make you go into uncontrollable 'roid rage' are myths.<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidudeman_9722.html" title="User:Wikidudeman"><b><font color="blue">Wikidudeman</font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikidudeman_054f.html" title="User talk:Wikidudeman">(talk)</a></sup> 01:21, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>One more thing — Wikidudeman mentioned "numerous misconceptions which should be rectified" and that "this was done in the evolution article as well". I disagree with this; an encyclopaedia is not about "rectifying" anything. An encyclopaedia, especially when dealing with a controversial topic, never assumes a position and does not pursue truth but information. This goes for the (flawed) evolution article as well, though this is not the place to discuss it. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomsintown_915d.html" title="User:Tomsintown">Tomsintown</a> 16:14, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Encyclopedias are there to provide factual information and if there are misconceptions surrounding a subject then they will dispel false information concerning them. This approach has been taken with the Evolution article and has been accepted by dozens of administrators and sysop's throughout wikipedia. There is nothing flawed about the evolution article. If you consider it to be flawed then go to that articles talk page <a href="../../../e/v/o/Talk%7EEvolution_8c56.html" title="Talk:Evolution">Talk:Evolution</a>.

<p>This is not directly to do with the action of steroids but, in reference to their use in 'gender dysmorphia' I think this possibly should be 'gender dysphoria' (normally how a transsexual female-to-male or otherwise would be diagnosed initially). It looks like the term has been blended with the concept of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD)... I didn't want to go and change it myself as the term may still be relavent to some extent and the page looks fairly well established by other contributors. -- S Thompson 2007-01-06. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.3.202.76_9028.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.3.202.76">82.3.202.76</a> (talk) 14:54, 6 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>I don't remember personally using that term but this is what it says...<i>"Used for gender dysmorphia: whereby secondary male characteristics (puberty) are initiated in female-to-male diagnosed patients."</i> And I looked for a site explaining the term and I found this one..<i><b>Gender dysphoria</b>: This is a medical term for feeling unhappy with your current gender (masculinity/femininity), which is in conflict with your physical sex. Many of us have mild feelings like this from time to time, but some people can be tormented by gender dysphoria for years on end.[<a href="http://www.thesite.org/sexandrelationships/sexuality/awareness/transvestismandtranssexualism" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thesite.org/sexandrelationships/sexuality/awareness/transvestismandtranssexualism" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>]<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidudeman_9722.html" title="User:Wikidudeman">Wikidudeman</a> 03:39, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</i></dd>

<dd>The sentence made it sound as it the liver takes a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prodrug.html" title="Prodrug">prodrug</a> form of the hormone and chemically-modifies it into the active form.
