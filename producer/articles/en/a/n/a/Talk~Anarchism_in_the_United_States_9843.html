<p>I'm not going to attempt to edit this article because RJ had shown a history of edit-war behivior, proposes that wikipedia is a perpetual edit war, refuses to compromise or join in on any attempts to reach consensus (indeed mocks them), and pushes he POV regardless of the cited facts presented to him. As such, I will simply provide evidence and tag this with NPOV:</p>
<p>1) The follow claim is given no source and is highly POV, "While individual anarchists of the anti-capitalist tradition are still active today, most individualist anarchists refer to themselves as anarcho-capitalists"</p>
<p>Not only is is questionable that anarcho-capitalists are individualists, but there is no evidence that "most" individualist anarchists consider themselves anarcho-capitalists (or even that most consider anarcho-capitalism to be a form of individualism).</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is false that there is no source provided. The link to it is right there at the end of the sentence. It says "<i>This dichotomy between communist and individualist anarchists continues to the present day. If anything, the differences have become even more pronounced. While the anarchists of old often argued fervently over ideological differences (Tucker and Johann Most refused to recognize one another as "true" anarchists), a mutual admiration frequently existed between the communist and individualist camps. Tucker was an admirer of the European anarchists Proudhon and Bakunin and translated their works into English and his anarchist journal, Liberty, published the writings not only of anarcho-socialists but also of outright Fabians or Marxists, such as George Bernard Shaw. Today, the two camps largely disavow one another. Most contemporary free market anarchists think of themselves as "anarcho-capitalists", whereas Tucker regarded himself as a socialist, and most anarcho-socialists of today reject free market anarchists as mere apologists for corporate power.</i>" <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 14:21, 22 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This source does not demonstrate its own claim, it merely makes it. As such, the article should list it as "so and so says" rather than fact. Further, its inappropriate for this opinion to shape the article itself and be so prominent, it should be mentioned further down. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 22:00, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>2) Wendy McElroy is listed as an individualist anarchist. This is POV, at most she should be listed as considering herself an individualist given that she actively rejects much of their tradition.</p>
<dl>
<dd>She is an individualist anarchist. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 14:21, 22 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, she isn't. She calls herself an individualist anarchist, while rejecting much of their tradition. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 16:32, 3 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It is a violation of NPOV to call her an individualist when some people believe she is not. It is all the more a violation when all the founders of individualism would have not considered her one. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 06:10, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Ok, find a source that says she's not an individualist anarchist then. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 06:34, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Sure. <i>Are individualist anarchists anti-capitalist? Yes</i> [<a href="http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/1931/secG1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/1931/secG1.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>]<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 17:05, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>3) There is almost NO new information in this article not already covered extensively in the individualist anarchism, anarcho-capitalist, and individualist anarchism and anarcho-capitalism articles. It is, in fact, merely a POV fork being used by RJ to stress those particular views of the individualists he wants to emphasize and repeat them over and over across several articles.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is not true. The <a href="../../../i/n/d/Individualist_anarchist.html" title="Individualist anarchist">individualist anarchist</a> article gives the impression that individualist anarchists support private property. That's not universally true unless you're talking about American anarchists. There are enough articles out there about American individualist anarchism as being unique that it deserves its own article. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 14:21, 22 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It would seem to me that a sentence or two indicating the fact that not all individualists support private property is sufficient, whereas an entire article created solely with the purpose of hammering this fact into the reader is a bit of a soap-box. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 22:00, 31 July 2005 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>I didn't say that an American individualist anarchist doesn't support private property, I said that this distinction could as easily be indicated by one or two sentences in the individualist article. All that you have done in this article is copy and paste sections from other articles to repeat what has already been said. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 16:32, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Factual inaccuracies include:</p>
<p>1) "Lysander Spooner is an individualist anarchist who apparently worked without association with the other individualists of the time, but came to approximately the same conclusions."</p>
<p>Lysander Spooner was in fact in association with individualists like Tucker. "...Lysander Spooner, an independent radical whose political and economic writings paralleled those of the better known group for many years. Regardless of the use made of his works, Spooner remained apart from the individualists except for brief instances of association during his later life..." -James J, Martin, Men against the State. I'll modify it to say "brief instances." <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 14:21, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>2) Repeatedly individualist anarchists are refered to as having "supported private property" even with such adjectives as "strongly". However, no referance at all is made to the distinctions between normative private property and possession. RJ is well aware of these distinctions from his edits on other pages, but is purposefully leaving them out to create the false impression that the property supported by the individualists is the same as that supported by other ideologies.</p>
<dl>
<dd>There is absolutely no difference in regard to the private property in the produce of labor that is supported by other ideologies. Private property is that which is rightfully possessed by an individual and which he has absolute dominion over. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 14:21, 22 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>When the individualists rejected rent from private property, interest from private property, and some rejected wage entailed from private ownership of the means of production, I would say that constitutes something more than "absolutely no difference" in their conception of private property from that of other ideologies. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 22:00, 31 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Man, don't you get it yet? Unworked land is not private property, for individualists. It's illegitimately-secured material. Private property is the produce of labor ..the classical liberal conception --that which an individual mixes with his labor is his property. Individualists anarchists believe in private property, that is, they believe in the liberty of an individual to possess the produce of his labor and have absolute dominion over it. This has nothing to do with land. What are you talking about when you say "some rejected wage entailed from private ownership of the means of production"? Are you talking about land? <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 22:22, 31 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm fully aware of the fact that unused land is not legitimate private property to individualist anarchists. I'm also aware of the fact that it is legitimate private property as private property is commonly refered to, thus when you say they STRONGLY advocated private property, and only except unused land in elipses, it creates a false impression. And no, I am not talking about land when I said that they rejected wage from private ownership of the means of production, I am talking about their advocacy of interest free banking, the absence of which they decried given the fact that the version of private property they supported was far more limited than what is commonly refered to and was limited in more ways than just "raw land", as you constantly insert into articles. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 16:32, 3 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I have no clue what you're talking about. Do you? "rejected wage from private ownership of the means of production"?? is that a typo? Are you saying that they oppose private ownership of the means of production? If so, you're wrong. It's only land that one does not work or occupy where private ownership is opposed. I don't understand why you're bringing up banking. Don't you realize that a printing press would be used to print currency? That's a means of production. What are you trying to say? <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 16:43, 3 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No RJ, I am saying that they reject wage profit earned as a result of the private ownership of the means of production. If you can't figure out what that means, I guess you will just remain confused. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 06:10, 5 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No shit that they reject profit, period. What's your point? <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 06:34, 5 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There rejection of profit is one of several limits they place on legitimate property use, thus the point that the form of property they support and advocate is limited relative to normative property relations, and beyond the single factor of unused land. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 17:05, 5 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You have a fundamental lack of understanding of the philosophy. The limitation is not on how property may be used, but on what is allowable as property. If it's private property, dominion over it is absolute --it's not a "limited form" of private property, as you like to say. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 00:51, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>3) Thoreau is listed as an individualist anarchist. While this may or may not have been the case, he never refered to himself as such, and this fact should be noted, especially since he was a contemporary of the individualists anarchists to it is quite possible that he knew of their existence. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 06:44, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Which of these guys did call themselves "individualist anarchists."? What makes them individualist anarchists are their philosophy. These guys are widely regarded as being individualist anarchists. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 14:21, 22 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Let me put it this way. Thoreau did not refer to himself as an anarchist, despite the fact that he was a contemporary of theirs. It is thus historical revisionism to claim that he is without indicating that this is a belief, rather than a fact. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 22:00, 31 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Ok, no problem. That can be fixed. I'll just delete Thoreau. But it's pretty obvious when a guy says that he is in favors the lack of all government that he's an anarchist. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 22:22, 31 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Then it would have been very easy for him to describe himself as such. If he didn't, perhaps he felt there was something about anarchism that did not fit with his ideals. That was his call to make, not yours. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 06:10, 5 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You don't have to call yourself an anarchist to be an anarchist. What the hell kind of reasoning is that? It's your philosophy of opposing the existence of government that makes you an anarchist. Did William Godwin call himself an anarchist? Did Max Stirner call himself an anarchist? Do you deny they're anarchists too? <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 06:34, 5 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This is what makes all your edits so POV RJ. You fail to even recognise the undeniable fact that many people today and throughout history believe that anarchism means more than simply anti-statism. Some of those people (like Sam Spade), believe it includes a number of undesirable things, while others (like Kropotkin) believe that it includes a number of desirable things. It is POV for you to write an article based on your personal view of what is and what is not anarchist. If Thoreau chose not to call himself an anarchist, perhaps it was because he felt there were other aspects besides anti-statism to the anarchist tradition that he did not identify with. Historical revisionism (like you have been consistently doing with Warren, for example) doesn't help anyone. And yes, I do deny that Stirner and Godwin are anarchists. Stirner because he denied it himself, Godwin because he predated the origin of the term as a self-description. That does not mean they are not generally considered anarchism, nor that their philosophies are not for the most part parallel to anarchism, it simply means they are not anarchists any more than Lao Tzu was. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 17:05, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>LOL! So, to be an anarchist you have to call yourself an anarchist. But, then when Wendy McElroy calls herself an anarchist you say she's not. Which is it?
<dl>
<dd>Stop putting words in my mouth. Just because you need to distort what other people say in order to fit your tiny categories does not mean that I conform to your skewed reality. I did not say that to be an anarchist you have to call yourself an anarchist. I am saying that for wikipedia to neutrally present someone as an anarchist, given that the definition of anarchism is so contested, requires that they believe it themselves. As for McElroy, self-description as an anarchists is a necessary condition to being refered to as an anarchists, but not a sufficient one. If it was then the definition of anarchism would not only be contested, it would be non-existent. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 18:21, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>But you're wrong. One doesn't have to call themselves an anarchist to be one. Does one have to call themselves a human to be one? You've got some really screwed up philosophy. A thing is what it is simply by virtue of it being that thing. One can say he is whatever he wants to say he is, but the fact remains that he is what he is. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 18:37, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Again, you are purposefully misrepresenting me. I did not say that someone has to call themselves an anarchists in order to be one.

<dd>Yes you did say that someone has to call themselves an anarchist in order to be one: "self-description as an anarchists is a necessary condition to being refered to as an anarchists, but not a sufficient one." There you have it. That's obviously your position. If someone doesn't call himself an anarchist then he can't be one, according to you. You're wrong.

<dd>You have intentionally taken my words out of context in order to misrepresent them. As I said above, I do not believe that this is a general principle. I believe that in the specific case of a contested term in the context of an encyclopedia with a neutral POV policy it would be non-neutral to present someone who did not consider themselves to be an anarchist as one, as it would imply support of a particular definition of anarchism over and above all the rest, thus breaking any attempt to remain neutral in regards to the issue of the definition of anarchism. But I already made this very clear. If you insist on being intellectuall dishonest and representing what I say apart from the context of everything I have said, then I have no choice but to ignore your appeals. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 07:15, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, many people believe that Godwin was a proto-anarchist. But that is beside the point. The burden of proof is on you to prove the positive assertion that Godwin is an anarchist, not on me to prove the negative assertion that he isn't. If you can find people saying that he is an anarchist, that is sufficient to claim that some people consider him an anarchist. If you can find many such people, that is sufficient to say that many consider him an anarchist. If everyone you find considers him such, that is sufficient to say that he is considered such (which is precisely what the Warren article said about Warren before you started butchering it). If he did not consider himself an anarchist, it is factually incorrect to call him one, just as it would be wrong to trot over the the Lao Tzu article and state definitively that he was an anarchist just because a large number of people consider him to have been one and there is no evidence in existence of anyone claiming that he wasn't one, just as it would be wrong to edit the Jesus Christ article stating prominently that he was an anarchist just because the christian anarchists believe he was one and no one can dig up evidence of someone explicitly saying otherwise. The burden of proof is basic logic RJ, learn it before you demand evidence from me.</dd>

<dd>Of course Greene was opposed to capitalism ..like the rest of the classical individualist anarchists. The sentence is just pointing out that it's only in the last 10 years of his life that his writings were explicitly anarchist (most people are probably not anarchists for the entire length of their lives). Is it that you don't think he was ever an anarchist? This statement by him in <i>Mutual Banking</i> is certainly anarchist: "Mutualism operates, by its very nature, to render political government, founded on arbitrary force, superfluous." By the way, that Martin book was written in 1953, so it's hardly "revisionist." It's considered a classic in the subject of individualist anarchism. Need a few more sources? "Individualist and mutualist anarchists like William Greene [Mutual Banking], Benjamin Tucker [Instead of a Book), and J. B. Robertson [The Economics of Liberty] viewed the money monopoly as central to the capitalist system of privilege." -(<i>The Iron Fist Behind the Invisible Hand</i> by Kevin A. Carson).

<p>Max, are you out of your mind? Individualist anarchists are not minarchists. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 13:46, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, Robert Nozick is on the minarchism page - Is he not an American individualist anarchist? Perhaps it should be merged with Anarcho-capitalism then? It's all part of pro-capitalist liberarianism...</p>
<p>This from the Anarcho-capitalism article - "Its grounding in liberalism is demonstrated by the assertion of many anarcho-capitalists that the first anarcho-capitalist was Gustave de Molinari, who argued for a free market and against a state monopoly on force" If thats your definition of Anarcho-C.. then it's almost synomynous (spellin?) with American individualist anarchism.</p>
<p>"..Likewise, Wendy McElroy says that when traditional individualist anarchists referred to "capitalism" they "meant state capitalism, the alliance of government and business."[24] This is something that anarcho-capitalists also oppose." (<a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalism</a> article)</p>
<p>Some anarcho-capitalists, such as Wendy McElroy, refer to themselves simply as "individualist anarchists," however the term is usually used in reference to the classical individualists. All the radical American individualists oppose the initiation of coercion and fraud, believing that force should be reserved for defense. (<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_individualist_anarchism.html" title="American individualist anarchism">American individualist anarchism</a> article)</p>
<p>Is there that much of a distiction? Really it's all just right-wing libertarianism. The Anarchism tag is on both articles...but really, Anarcho-capitalism is the only living (well at least in academia), contemporary philosophy as is indicated in the Libertarianism template. Actually, I would be more than happy to rename THIS article something like "Early American libertarianism".

<dd>Not all libertarians are anarchists, so no. Individualist anarchism is real and well-recognized. The distinction between classical individualist anarchism and anarcho-capitalism (which is a newer form of individualist anarchism) is that the latter do not adhere to the labor theory of value. So, unlike the original radical individualists they don't oppose profiting from capital (capitalism). <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 22:50, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Of course they are notably anarchist. I've never heard of anyone disputing that other than you. "Right libertarian" and "right anarchism" applies to anarcho-capitalism.

<p>I previously removed this statement because it was not supported by the text, "While individual anarchists of the anti-capitalist tradition are still active today, most individualist anarchists refer to themselves as anarcho-capitalists according to Keith Preston <a href="http://www.attackthesystem.com/capitalism.html" class="external text" title="http://www.attackthesystem.com/capitalism.html" rel="nofollow"><i>Capitalism versus Free Enterprise</i></a>."</p>
<p>In the text Preston does not state that most individualist anarchists refer to themselves as anarcho-capitalists. Rather, he states that most free market anarchists refer to themselves as anarcho-capitalists. This is a very different statement, as all it indicates is that there aren't very many individualists today.</p>
<p>The text goes on to extrapolate more information not found in the source material, "Contemporary individualists in the anti-capitalism tradition, such as <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Peacott_53d7.html" title="Joe Peacott">Joe Peacott</a>, hold that anarcho-capitalism is a non-traditional form of individualist anarchism <a href="http://world.std.com/~bbrigade/badpp3.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://world.std.com/~bbrigade/badpp3.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> "</p>
<p>Joe Peacott does not say this in the article, what he does say is that people who are anarcho-capitalists call themselves individualist anarchists, "There are all sorts of people who label themselves individualist anarchists and we often disagree among ourselves both about what to do now, and what the future might look like. For instance, the capitalist anarchists, like Wendy McElroy, Sam Konkin, Murray Rothbard, David Friedman, and the Voluntaryists, are individualists. However, there are other individualists, like myself and the individualists of the past, such as Benjamin Tucker, Josiah Warren, and John Henry Mackay, who reject capitalism as much as they reject communism." In fact, in other texts he is much more clear on this point, stating explicitly that individualist anarchism is anti-capitalist and contrasting it to anarcho-capitalism, "At the opposite end of the anarchist spectrum are the anarchist capitalists, who envision a form of capitalism without the state, which would bear little resemblance to the economic system which goes by the same name today...There is, however, another group within the anarchist movement that rejects both communal and capitalist economic arrangements. These are the individualists" <a href="http://www.libertarian.co.uk/lapubs/econn/econn097.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.libertarian.co.uk/lapubs/econn/econn097.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
<p>Further, while someone went out of their way to squeeze the very few instances of individualists and other anarchists being ambiguous on these points, they did nothing to give the overwhelming evidence that most anarchists of all varieties believe that individualism is anti-capitalist. So I will make all this clear in the text. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevkat_3df8.html" title="User:Revkat">Revkat</a> 19:48, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Regarding Preston, he indeed says the most free-market anarchists today refer to themselves as anarcho-capitalists. Maybe you're not realizing that the classical individualist anarchists were free-market anarchists. He's saying that most free-market anarchists today are anarcho-capitalists, rather than anti-capitalist free-market anarchists. Free-market anarchists and individualist anarchists are the same thing in this context. Regarding Peacott, maybe you missed this: "For instance, the capitalist anarchists, like Wendy McElroy, Sam Konkin, Murray Rothbard, David Friedman, and the Voluntaryists, are individualists." Obviously he's saying that they're individualist anarchists. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 22:37, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

In another article, he makes it very explicit that individualists are anti-capitalist and contrasted with anarcho-capitalists, as the quote I already gave demonstrates. As for Preston, yes he is saying that most market anarchists are anarcho-capitalists, that does not in any way entail that most individualists are anarcho-capitalists, only that there are more anarcho-capitalists today than there are individualists. Again, you are adding a lot of interpretation that is unsupported, and at times even contradicted, by the text. 01:38, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Peacott indeed says that anarcho-capitalists are individualists: "the capitalist anarchists, like Wendy McElroy, Sam Konkin, Murray Rothbard, David Friedman, and the Voluntaryists, are individualists." Dispute it all you want ..it's as plain as day. As far as Preston, you're ignoring that he's using <i>individualist anarchism</i> and <i>free market anarchism</i> interchangeably: "This dichotomy between communist and individualist anarchists continues to the present day. If anything, the differences have become even more pronounced. While the anarchists of old often argued fervently over ideological differences (Tucker and Johann Most refused to recognize one another as "true" anarchists), a mutual admiration frequently existed between the communist and individualist camps. Tucker was an admirer of the European anarchists Proudhon and Bakunin and translated their works into English and his anarchist journal, Liberty, published the writings not only of anarcho-socialists but also of outright Fabians or Marxists, such as George Bernard Shaw. Today, the two camps largely disavow one another. Most contemporary free market anarchists think of themselves as "anarcho-capitalists", whereas Tucker regarded himself as a socialist, and most anarcho-socialists of today reject free market anarchists as mere apologists for corporate power." Everybody knows that anarcho-capitalists are individualists --they're certainly not collectivists! <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 03:27, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Peacott also says that individualist anarchists reject capitalism, "There is, however, another group within the anarchist movement that rejects both communal and capitalist economic arrangements. These are the individualists" Dispute it all you want... its as plain as day. As for Preston, he is not using the terms interchangably, he never indicates that he is, and you have obviously run out of evidence. Your claim seems to be supported only by your assumptions, until you have actual evidence to back your claim beyond "anarcho-capitalists are individualists" because "everybody knows that" you are out of luck. It is strange that "everybody knows" this when Tucker didn't know it, Larry Gambone, Peter Sabatini, Iain McKay and Daniel Burton all seem to think it isn't true, and your best evidence that it is gives no such indication other than your own extrapolations. If anarcho-capitalists are individualist anarchists, why are all those individualists railing against capitalists all the time? Gee, they must be pretty confused. You should set them straight right away. First step, give some evidence of this undeniable fact. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevkat_3df8.html" title="User:Revkat">Revkat</a> 06:36, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How convenient for you to leave out the last part of second sentence out of the quote from Peacott above. Let's look at the whole sentence: "There is, however, another group within the anarchist movement that rejects both communal and capitalist economic arrangements. These are the individualists, who originated in the United States in the 1800s." It's clear he's talking about the original individualists and those who follow in that tradition. And, to answer your question "Why are all those individualists railing against capitalists all the time?" Because they were opposed to government-backed monopoly on credit and land (their definition of capitalism). Anarcho-capitalists are NOT collectivists. They're individualists who support profit making. Now, whether they're actually anarchists is where some debate could come in, but whether they are individualists is indisputable and is taken from granted by modern individualists in the classical tradition. Gambone explains the definitional issue. By the classical anarchist definition, anarcho-capitalists also oppose capitalism. Contemporary individualists in the 19th century tradition generally recognize that anarcho-capitalism is a form of anarchism, and all, of course, accept without question that they're individualists. I know of none that think they're collectivists. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 14:34, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with you that anarcho-capitalists are not collectivists. This does not make them individualist anarchists, a tradition which rejects capitalism (at least according to the copious amounts of evidence I've supplied so far, in contrast to the one or two ambiguous quotes you dug up while at the same time ignoring statements by those same authors that contradicted your point). And I agree with who wholly, the question is whether or not they are anarchists, but you keep conflating the term "individualist" with "individualist anarchist" as though the two are synonymous, but we both know they are not. Now if there are so many contemporary individualists who believe that anarcho-capitalism is both anarchist and individualist, then why do they all say so explicitly that individualism is anti-capitalist? Really, you are only going around in circles here, you know the evidence does not support your viewpoint, and are only hoping to convince me by extrapolation. Sorry, the text reads differently, and can most certainly be interpreted differently then the round-about approach you are taking. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevkat_3df8.html" title="User:Revkat">Revkat</a> 15:08, 7 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I already answered that question. By capitalism, the classical individualists mean government-backed privilege for capital.

<dd>I would suggest a merging of the two articles, together with an explicit acknowledgement that the category of "individualist anarchist" is partially anachronistic (in the sense that you'll be hard put to find anyone calling themselves an individualist anarchist prior to the 1870s) and hotly contested. NPOV can be maintained, I think, by acknowledging that the label "individualist anarchist" has always covered over a certain number of key differences, which can then be laid out clearly in the sub-sections. To lump Greene's explicitly Christian mutualism with Warren's individual sovereigntyism and the projects of Proudhon is both historically inaccurate and takes no account of the testimonies of the various early theorists. To <i>begin</i> with the opposition of <i>individualist anarchism</i> to "collectivism" can't help but be presentist and violate the NPOV rule, unless you can clarify your starting points and then deal adequately with the history. Again, focusing on Greene, his occasionally strong statements against "socialism" don't change the fact that he never seems to have abandoned the assumption, derived from Pierre Leroux's work, that human beings were unable to exercise the "holy" work of individual development without taking care of their connections to the "collective Adam."</dd>

<dd>I [don't?] think know what you mean by a "lumping together." There is nothing wrong with having an article devoted to the American individualists. It doesn't mean they agree on everything.

<dd>I agree that there is nothing inherently "wrong" with a separate article for the Americans. There is also nothing <i>wrong</i> with discussing folks who wouldn't have thought of themselves as "individualist anarchists" in an article on that topic <i>as long as it's clear what is being described and in what</i> (presentist) <i>terms it is being described.</i> All of us doing historical research in this area have inherited arguably deceptive categories and analyses. I have an enormous respect for James Martin's work. (He was, by the way, explicitly a "revisionist" in the Harry Elmer Barnes tradition.) But <i>Men Against the State</i> probably wouldn't stand a Wikipedia NPOV examination for very long. He does, in fact, "lump together" mutualists, individual sovereigntyists, etc as precursors to the egoist individualism that is his primary, partisan concern.</dd>

<dd>I would think that in a case like this a primary criteria for deciding how many and what kinds of articles are developed would be the efficient presentation of clear facts in well-defined contexts. My personal sense, based on my researches, is that the differences between American individualist anarchists and other individualist anarchists are not greater than the differences between American individualist anarchists. The category of <i>individualist anarchist</i> itself seems to be <i>presentist</i>, and therefore to need some explicit explanation in the article regarding its origins and importance. It seems like we can achieve a clear, NPOV article more efficiently by combining the American and English discussions. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 19:31, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>1&#160;: to restrain or dominate by force 2&#160;: <b>to compel to an act or choice</b> 3&#160;: to bring about by force or threat</p>
<p>On fraud 1 a&#160;: DECEIT, TRICKERY; specifically&#160;: intentional perversion of truth in order to induce another to part with something of value <b>or to surrender a legal right</b></p>
<p>Now obviously it is unlikely that any philosopher or pundit would straight out admit to accepting either coercion and fraud. But on closer look it seems it all depend on what one is talking about. So further elaboration is needed. Would you exclude Voltairine de Clayre, Emma Goldman etc and put them as being outside the American individualist anarchist tradition if they advocated <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squatting.html" title="Squatting">squatting</a>, <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occupation.html" title="Occupation">occupation</a> of workplaces, civil disobedience (breaking of capitalist laws) and physical resistance to Lock-outs? Also, in the article you keep refering to "American Individualists" Or do you hold this to be synomynous with American individualist anarchists? Almost anyone in politics in the past 200 years would probably describe themselves as individualist or 'pro-individual'.<br />
I think your claim that "Anyone moderately familiar with labor/value individualist anarchism knows that they support private property." is only marginally accurate when talking of a select bunch of individualists.. As as the article says they "oppose coercive privilege that they believe keeps capital concentrated in the hands of a few." But I think you would need to rename the article as it is toooo much of a generalisation when talking about 19th century american anarchists as individualism and equal liberty is at the core of anarchist philosophy. Over Xmas I managed to read some of Avrich's "An American Anarchist: Life of Voltairine De Cleyre" Very interesting stuff and her advocacy of debate and interaction between the various <i>shades</i> of anarchism quite emblematic in many ways. -- <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMax_rspct_e7d2.html" title="User:Max rspct"><b><font color="#A0522D" face="Cartier Book"><big>max rspct</big></font></b></a> <font size="1"><a href="../../../m/a/x/User_talk%7EMax_rspct_c799.html" title="User talk:Max rspct"><font color="red">leave a message</font></a></font> 23:32, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>1) Emma Goldman was a commmunist, not an individualist. 2) The American individualists (<i>individualist</i> in this article is simply shorthand for <i>individualist anarchist</i>) opposed the use of coercion (physical force) unless used in response coercion --this is standard libertarian tenet.

"Yet, historian Arthur E. Bestor, Jr. noted in his 1948 essay on socialist terminology that, between 1864 and 1914, "the most remarkable fact about socialist terminology was its relative stability. The general acceptance of socialism as the comprehensive name for the movement was largely responsible."[7]" Why even add that in? What value does it add? I think that only confuses things. Obviously Bestor wasn't aware of the individualist anarchist usage.

I added the quote, because you wanted proof that your wee Parsons quote was not the whole story. I think that it is very relevant for maintaining a NPOV. Otherwise, we risk writing away the socialist influences of individualism.

All you're doing is making it even more confusing just because you want to, wrongly, link it with communism. Look at it; it's a big mess now because I had to rebut your attempts to associate individualism with communism.

<dd>I'm glad that you accept that definition, since it really hasn't changed all that much since the beginning of the nineteenth century. Your edits have distinctly implied that there is nothing socialistic about individualist anarchism; that's misleading. You seem to want to imply that there is a stark, unassailable, binary dichotomy between socialism and individualism; that's misleading. My edits are just balancing that out. --AaronS 18:34, 22 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I accept that definition as the contemporary definition --today's definition. The individualists anarchists are obviously not using that definition. There is a "stark binary dichotomy" between THAT definition of socialism and individualism. That's all I'm trying to point out. People today seeing the term "socialism" are accepting the modern definition of socialism and of course are going to be confused, so it needs to be pointed out that this is not what we're talking about when we say "socialism" in the article. 18:41, 22 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It isn't? Says who? Besides the definition that you provided from Parsons, which might be talking about socialism in terms of harmonism, I've never seen a definition of socialism that doesn't in some way incorporate some notion of at least some amount of collective ownership or limitation of liberal ownership. --AaronS 18:46, 22 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's self-evident that they're not using that definition. They don't wish to abolish property property and collectivize the means of production. It looks like you're one of the people that needs the clarification in the article. It's precisely the confusion you're having that I'm trying to prevent by noting this in the article. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 18:50, 22 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Not all definitions of socialism are so extreme. You're attempt to ease the confusion, however, does not demonstrate this fact. Rather, it defines socialism in a way that goes against all other definitions of socialism. It is possible to be a socialist and only be against <i>some</i> aspects of liberal ownership; it is possible to be a socialist and only advocate <i>some</i> level of collectivization. Your dichotomy might make things as clear as the difference between black and white, but that's not very accurate, because the difference is not so stark. --AaronS 18:54, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>SOMETHING needs to be said to show that they don't agree with the modern definition of socialism. I can't understand why you're trying to obscure it with all this nonsense. They fully support private property in the produce of labor (including means of production, capital) and a market economy to trade that produce --that's liberalism. What they don't support is private property in land (actually a few of them do), BUT they don't support collective ownership in it either. It's not related to the modern definition of socialism, and that needs to be made clear to HELP THE READER. Why confuse the reader? <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 19:03, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>No, liberalism is more Lockean. That's mutualism. There's nothing confusing if we fully explain the individualist positions and then also note that they embrace a different approach to private property and also call themselves socialists. I'm not obsfucating anything. It may be clearer to the reader to say "They called themselves socialists, but they didn't mean it," but that's not honest. Accuracy is more important than simplicity. Simplicity is very important, but accuracy should never be sacrificed for it. --AaronS 19:11, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What do you mean they have a different approach to property? What is different? Even Jefferson felt that there was no natural right to property in land, yet he was a liberal by every sense of the term --not a socialist.

<p>Where's your citation for this: "However, individualist anarchists opposed the communist notion of "common ownership," unless capital was created collectively."&#160;? It sounds like you're trying to associate it with communist ideas where because something is made by the division of labor it then becomes owned collectively --a communist argument. The individualist didn't argue that. If a machine is made by the division of labor it belongs to whomever paid the laborers to produce it.<a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 05:22, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Greene is quite clear that the mutual bank would be supplemented by cooperatives in the realm of production and consumption.

This presupposes that the tradition of the Declaration was not "influenced by European libertarian or radical ideas," which we might question.

<dd>Very good points. It should also be noted that the question of property was an important one in founding the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>. There was much debate between those who wanted to enshrine property rights and those who believed that the unequal distribution of property would destroy republican democracy. There is a reason why Jefferson did not write "Life, liberty and property," but rather "Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." I actually have a scholarly essay that deals explicitly with this question. When I get home, I'll review it. --AaronS 19:16, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>He was certainly not concernd about "unequal distribution of property." There is a difference between being concerned about equal distribution, and equitable distribution.

<dd>True. I've been meaning to fix that. The quote was talking about the origins, and that does need to be made clear --it's talking about Warren and Andrews. Warren and Andrews weren't directly influenced by the Europeans as far as I know.

<dd>RJII, you had better check on Andrews. The guy who spoke a couple of dozen languages and wrote the treatises on "Universology" was certainly familiar with Fourier and Comte, and deeply influenced by both. I have the universological texts at home, so I can check a bit more soonish. Warren was certainly influenced by Owen, and would have known Gray's work. Again, this is checkable.

<li>Can we acknowledge that this is a question that needs some more work? And not do quite so much turf-defense in the editing? Proudhon says straight out that he is "synthesizing" (early) or "balancing" (late) "property and communism." Equating the two is going to be inaccurate, but the stark divide approach is also going to lead us astray. Greene is balancing socialism, capitalism and communism. Maybe if we do the work to clarify this apparent contradiction in early mutualism, some of our other problems will disappear. Personally, I think the entry should be inclusive.

<li>"The earth is given as a common stock for man to labor and live on." Jefferson, cited in Kammen at footnote 17.</li>
<li>"...writing to Jefferson from Quincy, [Adams] conveyed a sense of the inevitable in troubled tones: 'as long as Property exists, it will accumulate in Individuals and Families....So sure as the Idea and the existence of PROPERTY is admitted and established in Society, Accumulations of it will be made, the Snow ball will grow as it rolls.' Why was the accumulation of property in families and individuals problematic? Because it encouraged aristocracy which was antithetical to republicanism." Kammen at 7.</li>

<li>"Many of those who have written about assumptions concerning property in America at the time of the Founding tend to provide an exegesis upon Locke's views of property in the <i>Second Treatise</i> and then leap directly to 1787 in a rather unhistorical way, as though no changes or modifications intervened that might have affected the attitudes of the Founders." Id.</li>
<li>"Equally significant, and perhaps even more so, the Preamble to the Constitution--its clearest statement of underlying assumptions and values--never mentions property.

<li>"One of the most penetrating and forceful Antifederalists, writing as 'A [Maryland] Farmer,' summed up the outlook of many by asserting that 'the unequal division of property silently and gradually undermines' liberty and equality, two of the most vital props of republicanism."

<dd>Yes, Jefferson did at times suggest that people have an equal distribution of land.

<p>In fact, Madison's definition of property was <i>very</i> broad: property "embraces every thing to which man may attach a value and have a right; and <i>which leaves to every one else the like advantage.</i> In the former sense, a man's hand, or merchandise, or money is called his property. In the latter sense, and man has property in his opinions and the free communication of them." (James Madison, "Property," <i>The National Gazette</i> (March 29, 1792)) So, clearly, we're not only talking about land, here. --AaronS 03:22, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It depends on the context. I know that when Jefferson refers to "property" he's frequently talking about land, as are commentaries about him. Do you honestly think Jefferson advocated equal distribution of income? That's ludicrous. How detached can you be from the philosophy of liberalism? <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 03:26, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Of course it depends on the context. Jefferson may not have advocated <i>for</i> the equal distribution of income, but he certainly did criticize the stratification of wealth, i.e. <i>all</i> property, as being anti-republican. --AaronS 03:29, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>He did have some concern for grossly disproportionate wealth, but he definitely was not concerned about "unequal" distribution of wealth. He thought individuals had the right to private property in the product of labor, like all liberals. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 03:32, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>He wrote to Madison on October 28, 1785: "Whenever there is in any country, uncultivated lands and unemployed poor, it is clear that the laws of property have been so far extended as to violate natural right." His words, not mine. Then Kammen writes, as I noted above: "[The disciples of Jefferson] recurred frequently to 'the principles of a just and equal distribution.'" Further, he "perceived the alternatives in stark form: 'economy [as in thriftiness/frugality] <i>and liberty</i>, or <i>profusion and servitude.'" --AaronS 03:38, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</i>
<dl>
<dd>He did believe in natural rights, of course. That's well known. But, he didn't hold that there was any <i>particular</i> arrangement or distribution of land that natural rights indicated. It was up to society to decide exactly what the rules on land were going to be. His philosophy is scattered around in letters. There's nothing really comprehensive that you can read on his philosophy by him, other than probably Notes on Virginia. You have to piece stuff together, and not everything he says is in agreement. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 03:57, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Liberals had varying opinions on land, just like the individualist anarchists. But one thing that's constant in liberalism (including individualist anarchism in America) is the right to private property in the product of labor. And, another thing is advocacy of a minimal state. Or in the case of radical liberalism, no state. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 04:06, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This section seems quite informative and well cited. It explains the individualist anarchist property system well, and shows the differences between it and the more well-known communist and capitalist alternatives. What objections, if any, are there to this chart? <a href="../../../7/2/2E/User%7E72.204.5.50.html" title="User:72.204.5.50">72.204.5.50</a></p>

<dd>For one, the chart is overly simplistic. Many individuals who fall under or are generally considered to fall under some of the categories in the chart do not hold the views it represents. Further, it is flatly inaccurate in many cases. For example, it claims that under anarcho-communists profits from labor, land, and loans, "should be confiscated". Yet, most modern anarcho-communists simply believe that no active protection of such property claims should be asserted. Similarly, the "are privately owned capital goods permissible" question is not applicable, as most anarcho-communists do not theorize about what is "permissible" in society but rather about what is desirable and just. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlahblahblahblahblahblah_a472.html" title="User:Blahblahblahblahblahblah">Blahblahblahblahblahblah</a> 09:44, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It seems like you have some minor quibbles about the wording, but on the whole agree with the chart. You indicate that you would switch the wording from "permissable" to "just" in one place, and "should be confiscated" to "should not be asserted" in another place.

<dd>TUF: Why do you say that such an article can't be written without becoming a <small>POV</small> fork? That doesn't make any sense to me.

(It seems obvious to <i>me</i> that all of these 20th-century figures have significant differences from the 19th-century individualists, and often in different directions!)

<dd>There is more evidence for Wendy McElory being an anarchist, but U.S. anarchists do not see Rothbard as an anarchist. Him saying that he is an "anarcho-capitalist" doesn't make him an anarchist.

<dd>Wendy McElroy is an anarcho-capitalist but because she chooses the term "individualist anarchist" instead, you think that she's an anarchist but Rothbard is not. That's crazy. McElroy says she's a Rothbardian. You should become a little more knowledgable about anarchism before you start editing here. You are wrong to remove Rothbard. He's very significant.

<dd>If you think what anarchists think about who is and isn't an anarchist is what matters, then you don't know much about Wikipedia. Most self-described "anarchists" are not free to push their POV here. The opinion of "most anarchists" is not really relevant other than simply to state what they're opinions are, if you can source that. What matters is scholarly opinion. Almost all scholars regard anarcho-capitalism as one of the many forms of anarchism. I don't care how long you've been an anarchist. I don't consider you an anarchist. You're opinion means very little here, as does mine. (Infoshop is not the most popular anarchist website anyway. Anti-state.com is. But, that's irrelevant anyway.)

<p>To try to avoid a stupid, head-to-head edit war, let me just point out a couple of pretty serious problems with the current account of Warren's "cost principle." We can go from there.</p>
<ul>
<li>To start, it's pretty obvious that the full account given is <i>not</i> contained on the single page I cited in the earlier edit. Of course, on the <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josiah_Warren_9645.html" title="Josiah Warren">Josiah Warren</a> page, the same account is not sourced at all.</li>
<li>The phrase "value the limit of price" does not appear to be either Warren's or Andrews'. In searchable texts online, it only appears in a review by George Ripley which characterizes Warren's system as "communism." (<i>Hmmmm</i>) If it actually appears in Warren, as the use of quotation marks suggests, it needs to be cited.</li>
<li>The stock "based on the LTV" phrase, which an-cap editors are fond of inserting, in this case renders the paragraph incoherent. In the passages cited, Warren quite clearly associates <i>value</i> with any number of <i>subjective</i> factors.</li>
<li>This confusion is compounded, as it currently appears that all goods sold by Warren were valued according to a simple labor-time formula of some sort, when what we know of Warren's practice is that his "cost-price" consisted of the cost to him of the goods (apparently at market prices), plus compensation for the time it took to sell the goods.</li>
<li>The reference to Warren's labor notes is currently too little to help.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to get the section coherent again, the issues of "value theory" vs. "cost theory," source of wealth vs. principle of equitable commerce, time store vs. labor for labor exchange need to be dealt with, and not run together into the sort of mess they are presently. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 17:20, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your changes are bad and should be deleted. You're deleting cited information and citing things with non-credible sources, such as an online survey from Infoshop.org.

<dd>Who are you? Perhaps you can establish your identity before you vandalize more articles. I'm Chuck Munson, an anarchist of 20 years who runs Infoshop.org. I've been profiled by the New York Times and the Washington Post as one of the more notable contemporary anarchists. I'm currently editing an anthology titled <a href="http://www.northamericananarchist.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.northamericananarchist.org/" rel="nofollow">North American Anarchist Thought Since 1960</a> with Jason McQuinn, another famous and influential anarchist. You challenged my link to the survey, but you have failed to source any of your own changes. The Infoshop survey is probably the most accurate and comprehensive survey of the U.S. anarchist movement in recent years. Now Rothbard may be a famous American Libertarian, but he does not belong in this entry on U.S. anarchism. The contemporary anarchist movement rarely talks about Rothbard, whereas there are numerous contemporary anarchists whose influence should be featured more than several paragrpahs on Rothbard. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuck0_00fb.html" title="User:Chuck0">Chuck0</a> 04:25, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not "bragging" about being a long-term anarchist and running a website. I'm pointing those things out because they qualify me to make informed, sourced changes, edits, and contributions to this entry. I'm a widely-known anarchist and I know quite a bit about anarchism. Infoshop.org isn't just the most popular U.S. anarchist site, it has a high Google rank and has been used as a source in numerous books and articles. I'm also a librarian of 17 years, which qualifies me to know something about encyclopedias. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, in case you didn't notice. If Wikipedia is going to be accurate and useful to people, then it has to give precedence to people who actually <b>now something</b> about these subjects. You have not identified who you are or your qualifications, so anything you say or do here should be be disregarded. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuck0_00fb.html" title="User:Chuck0">Chuck0</a> 04:59, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, they do not qualify you to make informed changes. You're obviously not very informed about anarchism. Maybe your name floats around in nerdy internet anarchist circles. So what? You're not "widely known" at all. You run a cheesy internet social anarchist web site. So what? Above all, you need to learn about how Wikipedia works. There is a rule against "original research." Your, mine, and everyone elses's opinions are irrelevant. If you want to put information in the encylcopedia then it needs to be cited from a scholarly source.

<dd>Who are you again? Oh right, some coward who attacks people from the safety of an anonymous account. I understand how Wikipedia works. I've been contributing to Wikipedia for several years. I'm also a librarian, so I understand a few things about encyclopedias, reference tools, and sourcing information. You've established no credentials for yourself, so you are just a sniping coward.

<p>I put a Disputed tag on this section because "Chuck0" deleted Rothbard. Rothbard is the most famous individualist of the 20th century. There were like 10 sources in the section citing anarcho-capitalism as an individualist form of anarchism. But Chuck0 took it upon himself to enforce his POV that it is not a form of anarchism.</p>
<dl>

<dd>You just stated that Rothbard "is the most famous individualist of the 20th century." This is an entry on <b>anarchism</b> in the United States, not American small government conservatives like Rothbard. There were ten sources in that section? Sounds like somebody was insecure about putting (wrongly) Rothbard into this entry. Now I could cite several hundred anarchist books and magazines that rarely talk about Rothbard. The problem is that the reality of my collection of anarchist books, articles and other materials can't and shouldn't be cited here. You are making claims here as an anonymous, unregistered user. I've established myself as a person who is knowledgeable about contemporary American anarchism.

<dd>Rothbard is the most popular individualist anarchist of the 20th century. Again, we don't care you who are. Big deal, you run a website. Do you want a pat on the back? Your opinion does not count for anything here. Information on Wikipedia needs to be cited by published scholarly sources. We're not going to take your word on things just because you run an "anarchist" website (a website which by the way censors anarcho-capitalist content, because it's a threat to the rapidly disintegrating philosophy of social anarchism)</dd>

<dd>Actually, Voltairine de Cleyre was the most popular and famous individualist of the 20th century. "We don't care?" Who is we? Are you a sockpuppet for the anarcho-capitalist club at some high school? My opinion doesn't count for anything? How about the facts? Reality? Ever heard of that, Mr. Sockpuppet?

<p>No, you remove posts from anarcho-capitalists because the rationality of anarcho-capitalist philosophy exposes social "anarchism" for the crock that it is. "We" is we, the users of Wikipedia. As far as you personally being a source for anything, we don't recognize your opinion as counting for anything. It doesn't count for anything. If you want to say something in an article then it needs to be cited from a scholarly source. Just coming here and boasting that you've been an "anarchist" for 20 years (big deal, whatever dude) and that you run a web site (who cares?) doesn't qualify you as an authority.</p>

Anarcho-capitalists do not subscribe to the labor theory of value of the early individualists, but, like them, they do believe that security should be provided by multiple competing businesses rather than by a tax-funded central agency.</p>
<p>Rothbard claims heritage in the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Individualist_anarchism.html" title="Individualist anarchism">individualist</a> school<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> and strongly opposes anarcho-communism and other related ideologies that would prefer that wealth be distributed collectively instead of held individually. In anarcho-capitalism, the individual has no obligation to any other member of the community that he does not impose on himself.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Talk%7EAnarchism_in_the_United_States_9843.html" title="Edit section: Why Murray Rothbard doesn't belong on this page">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Why Murray Rothbard doesn't belong on this page</span></h2>
<p>Instead of getting into another revert war for this entry, I'm going to go into some detail about why Murray Rothbard doesn't belong on this page, at least not as a featured section. What I'm going to talk about here is something us librarians know about, but is a concept unfamiliar to many Wikipedia contributors. User <b>Anarcho-capitalism</b> is arguing here that it is established that Rothbard is an anarcho-capitalist and thus deserves to be <i>featured</i> in this entry on "Anarchism in the United States." The main reason why I'm removing Rothbard has to do with the way this entry is structured. Encyclopedia entries can be structured in several different ways. This entry on "Anarchism in the United States" is structured so that <b>people</b> are featured. Another valid way to structure this entry would be to describe the various anarchist ideologies held by American anarchists. Another structure could focus on anarchist organizations and publications. Another structure could focus on historical events, such as the Haymarket incident, Sacco &amp; Vanzetti, the Palmer Raids, the Yippie movement, the continental gatherings in the 1980s, and so on. Of course, a really well-written entry on "Anarchism in the United States would attempt to cover all of these facets.</p>
<p>This entry also has a problem with its lack of coverage on contemporary anarchism in the United States.</p>
<p>If we just look at the current entry, which relies on mini-biographies of famous anarchists, there are standard rules of thumb when it comes to writing an entry such as this one. Featured biographies should focus on famous and influential anarchists who have had some impact on anarchism in the United States. I believe this is how similar entries on Wikipedia are structured. A person featured should be notable in some way, in terms of words or actions. Murray Bookchin, for example, is one of the most influential American anarchist writers of the past 40 years. He has published a significant body of works. His name and works are known to most anarchists and they have prompted a response by other anarchists (in this case, including several books criticial of Bookchin).</p>
<p>Anarchists also value deeds and activism. So this entry, if it focuses on individuals to explain "Anarchism in the United States," should include a few featured sections on activist anarchists. Keith McHenry, for example, is notable for co-founding the Food Not Bombs movement, which is now an international movement. Starhawk should be included for her activism in the anti-globalization movement, along with her work in the feminist, ecological, anti-war, anti-nuclear, and women's spirituality movements. How about people who have published magazines for 20 consecutive years, such as Jason McQuinn?</p>
<p>If you are going to base an entry on mini-biography sections, the people listed should be notable, famous and influential anarchists. Rothbard simply doesn't qualify and shouldn't be featured. Of course, it's really hard to establish how notable somebody is within a given subject area. Often you have to rely on experts and researchers to guage that influence. You can measure influence by citations of a person's work or their mention in both anarchist and non-anarchist media. I believe that Noam Chomsky is one of the most cited living scholars, which would also make him the most well-known anarchist. If you did a citation search on anarchist authors, who would be the most cited? I haven't done this, but I'd guess that Chomsky, Zinn, Hakim Bey, and David Graeber would score highly in any citation search. Citation counting has its limitations, even more so when it comes to the U.S. anarchist movement, which isn't based in the academy and whose publications are poorly indexed and rarely cited. So how does one go about establishing the notability of an anarchist within the U.S. anarchist movement. Those of us who are well-versed in the anarchist movement can give you some solid candidates for the most notable anarchists, but this isn't sourceable.</p>
<p>So let's take the case of Murray Rothbard. Is he notable enough to be featured on this page? I don't think so, because his affiliation with anarchism is contested and because he simply hasn't had much influence on the <b>U.S. anarchist movement.</b> Rothbard IS an influential Libertarian, but this page is about "Anarchism in the U.S." Rothbard's work has not been published in any anarchist periodicals that I know about. Did he ever attend any of the major U.S. anarchist conferences of the 1980s? I don't remember him ever speaking at an anarchist conference. Are his books caried by the largest anarchist publisher in the U.S., AK Press? I'm afraid not.</p>
<p>So far, Rothbard is batting .000 when it comes to being a notable anarchist within the contemporary anarchist movement in the U.S. I know that articles here and there in anarchist journals mention Rothbard, but I don't have the time right now to search my archives. I did pull out several of the most widely known U.S. anarchist anthologies published in the past 40 years. I looked at the Table of Contents and the indices in the following books:</p>
<ul>
<li>Howard Ehrlich and others. <i>Reinventing Anarchy. What are anarchists thinking these days?</i> Routledge, 1979.</li>
<li>Howard Ehrlich and others. <i>Reinventing Anarchy, Again.</i> AK Press, 1996.</li>
<li>David Apter and James Joll. <i>Anarchism Today.</i> Anchor Books, 1972.</li>
<li>George Woodcock. <i>Anarchism: a history of libertarian ideas and movements.</i> World Publishing, 1971.</li>
<li>Paul Avrich. <i>Anarchist Voices: an oral history of anarchism in America.</i> Princeton Univ. Press, 1995.</li>
<li>Paul Nursey-Bray. <i>Anarchist Thinkers and Thought: an annotated bibliography.</i> Greenwood Press, 1992.</li>
<li>Mike Gunderloy and Michael Ziesing, editors. <i>Anarchy and the End of History.</i> Factsheet Five/Lysander Spooner, 1991.</li>
<li>Clifford Harper. <i>Anarchy: a graphic guide.</i> Camden Press, 1987.</li>
<li>Irving Horowitz. <i>The Anarchists.</i> Dell Publishing, 1964.</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these anthologies and books include articles or chapters from Rothbard. His name is only cited in two of the works. The Avrich book cites Rothbard in a footnote, but only to explain who anarchist Fred Woodworth is referring to when he mentions "Rothbardites" in his interview.</p>
<p>Rothbard is more prominently featured in Nursey-Bray's bibliography on anarchist thinkers. This is an academic book published by a press which specializes in reference works for libraries. Rothbard is featured, but the context is very interesting. The book provides three pages of books by and about Rothbard in a section titled "On the Margins of Anarchist Theory." Notice that Rothbard is singled out as being on the margins of anarchism. The bibliographer's intro to the Rothbard section is worth quoting:</p>
<p>"Either the inclusion or the omission of Rothbard as an anarchist is likely, in one quarter or another, to be viewed as contentious. Here, his Anarcho-Capitalism is treated as marginal, since, while there are linkages with the tradition of individualist anarchism, there is a dislocation between the mutualism and communitarianism of that tradition and the free market theory, deriving from Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich von Hayek, that underpins Rothbard's political philosophy, and places him in the modern Libertarian tradition."</p>
<p>Here is an academic source which clearly notes that Rothbard's status as an anarchist is contentious and that his writings and thought, while notable, are marginal to anarchism.</p>
<p>There is no one source which can be cited as to which anarchist is more important than the other ones (and anarchists would themselves be against such a ranking system). User <b>Anarcho-capitalism</b> is arguing that sources say that Rothbard IS an anarcho-capitalist. I have issues with his sources, but that's not what is at issue here. None of his sources establish that Rothbard was an influential anarchist to U.S. anarchism. On the contrary, as I've outlined above, if you go over the body of anarchist litertaure for the past 50 years, the absence of Rothbard is glaring.</p>
<p>You could argue that Murray Rothbard has been influential on U.S. individualist anarchists. If that's the case, then I think that some actual anarcho-individualists such as Joe Peacott should be featured before Rothbard. Anarcho-individualism is a minor tendency in U.S. anarchism, so I'd only feature one or two. This entry doesn't feature any contemporary anarcho-communists and they are one of the biggest tendencies in U.S. anarchism.</p>
<p>So, Rothbard doesn't belong in this entry because he isn't a notable U.S. anarchist who was active within U.S. anarchism. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuck0_00fb.html" title="User:Chuck0">Chuck0</a> 00:12, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Rothbard has been *extremely* influential in american anarchism - he's arguably the *most* influential figure in fact. Numerous sources have been given you for that fact. I realise that some socialist anarchists deny that anarcho-capitalism is anarchist at all (and the same accusation is often thrown back in the opposite direction) but it's not within our purview as wikipedia editors to take sides in such disputes. As you correctly point out - there is a sharp distinction between early generations of individual anarchism and the current one - and this distinction has primarily to do with the change from LTV to STV. This was in large part (though by no means exclusively) Rothbards influence.</dd>

<dd>Rothbard will be removed from this article, once other Wikipedia users get involved and demand some accuracy. It just boggles my mind that people like you guys exist. I have an extensive collection of anarchist books and magazines. I'm hard pressed to find any mention of Rothbard in any of these materials and I'm going through them right now for a book I'm working on, an anthology on the last 40 years of North American anarchism titled <a href="http://www.northamericananarchist.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.northamericananarchist.org/" rel="nofollow">North American Anarchist Thought Since 1960</a>. There are several archives in the U.S. which have big collections of anarchist materials. I will ask the curators of these collections if Rothbard has been a notable anarchist or influence on U.S. anarchism. I expect to hear that he has not been a notable influence.</dd>

<dd>You say that "some" anarchists think that anarcho-capitalism isn't anarchist? Dude! Most anarchists laugh at the idea that anarcho-capitalism is a form of anarchism. How can an oxymoron be a credible political philosophy? Anarchism has always been opposed to capitalism and the state. Anarchists have written and spoken at length over the last 130 years about how the state and capitalism are hopelessly interlinked. Rothbard simply isn't an anarchist or an influence on anarchism. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuck0_00fb.html" title="User:Chuck0">Chuck0</a> 23:53, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You think Joe Peacott is more notable than Rothbard? Are you serious?! Hardly anyone has heard of him and he's had negligible influence. Rothbard is the most famous of the modern individualist anarchists, by far. <i>"This volume honors the foremost contemporary exponent of free-market anarchism. One contributor aptly describes Murray Rothbard as 'the most ideologically committed zero-State academic economists on earth'."</i> Review by Lawrence H. White of Man, Economy, and liberty: Essays in honor of Murray N. Rothbard, published in Journal of Economic Literature, Vol XXVIII, June 1990, page 664." But, not only that, he's more well-known that all of the 19th century individualists. Anarcho-capitalism is probably the most popular type of anarchism in the U.S. According to this source it was the most popular type in the 1970's: "Despite this diversity, we can categorize all anarchists as essentially left-wing libertarians who champion the growth of the individual within a community (Anarcho-Communists, Christian Anarchists, and most Anarcho-Pacifists) and right-wing libertarians (Anarcho-Capitalists, and ultraindividualists) who are most egoistical and stress the individualism of the unregulated marketplace. Since the social ethic of American is not communal but is based on a private world of personal fulfillment and satisfaction (the self-made man, not social man) it is not surprising that what I call right-wing libertarianism was the predominant element of the new, explicit anarchism." DeLeon, David. The American as Anarchist: Reflections on Indigenous Radicalism. John Hopkins University Press, 1978, p. 123 If anything, it's probably even more popular today. And Rothbard is the most famous anarcho-capitalist.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 02:39, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Did you read my explanation? I guess not. Rothbard is a famous and notable <b>American Libertarian</b>. Rothbard is NOT a notable anarchist nor has he had any notable influence on anarchism. In U.S. anarchist circles, people are going to know who Joe Peacott is. If you ask them to name an individualist anarchist, his name will come up. Rothbard's will not. Your assertion that Rothbard is an individualist anarchist would be disputed by even individualist anarchists. You are engaged in original research here, in claiming that Rothbard is an influential U.S. anarchist. Anarcho-capitalism is NOT the most popular form of anarchism in the United States. There are only a handful of anarcho-capitalists out there, which probably number fewer than the least popular form of actual anarchism. Your argument here is just laughable. If anarcho-capitalists are the biggest type of anarchists in the U.S., why doesn't AK Press carry any of their books? Why aren't there any anarcho-capitalist speakers at anarchist conferences? I could dig up more facts about U.S. anarchism, but I've already documented above why the Rothbard section is totally out of place on this entry. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuck0_00fb.html" title="User:Chuck0">Chuck0</a> 00:02, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Being a famous and notable "libertarian" is identical to being a famous and notable anarchist. There are left libertarians and right libertarians. As the source just above says, "all anarchists as essentially left-wing libertarians who champion the growth of the individual within a community (Anarcho-Communists, Christian Anarchists, and most Anarcho-Pacifists) and right-wing libertarians (Anarcho-Capitalists, and ultraindividualists) who are most egoistical and stress the individualism of the unregulated marketplace." And, the other source I gave you said that Rothbard is "the foremost contemporary exponent of free-market anarchism." AK Press probably doesn't carry any of their books because it's run by a bunch of anti-capitalist "anarcho"-collectivists. On the other hand, there are plenty more outlets that carry books dealing with right libertarianism. Right libertarianism (anarcho-capitalism) is much more popular in the U.S. than left libertarianism ("anarcho"-communism, and the other collectivist philosophies).<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 02:39, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You just don't get it do you? Are you really this dense? I have outlined above why Rothbard is not a notable anarchist, based on anarchist sources. You have cited a variety of mostly <b>non-anarchist</b> sources. As a librarian, is this the point where I give you the lecture about why reference books are not always accurate and are often filled with errors? Like Wikipedia. What's revealing about all the sources that you've attached to the Rothbard section is that you know that your position here is weak. Rothbard may be a notable Libertarian, but this is an entry on Anarchism in the United States. Rothbard should not be featured on this page. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuck0_00fb.html" title="User:Chuck0">Chuck0</a> 04:24, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>There is no rule that says someone has to be an anarchist to a reliable source on the study of anarchism. Non-anarchist sources are legitimate sources. You want an anarchist though? Here you go: *"Individualist, as distinct from socialist, anarchism has been particularly strong in the USA from the time of Josiah Warren (1798-1874) onwards and is expressed today by Murray Rothbard and the school of 'anarcho-capitalists'." <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoffrey_Ostergaard_2a1a.html" title="Geoffrey Ostergaard">Ostergaard, Geoffrey</a>. <i><a href="http://www.ppu.org.uk/e_publications/dd-trad6.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ppu.org.uk/e_publications/dd-trad6.html" rel="nofollow">Resisting the Nation State - the anarchist and pacifist tradition, Anarchism As A Tradition of Political Thought</a></i>. Peace Pledge Union Publications The reason so many sources are listed is not because it's a "weak position" that Rothbard is an anarchist. It's to show that it's the mainstream common view that Rothbard is an anarchist. If there were only two sources, you would claim there weren't enough sources - that it was a minority view. Well, here's lot of sources then. There are thousands of sources. Almost all scholars consider it to be anarchism (of course). On the other hand, very very few writers say that Rothbard is not an anarchist, and guess what, they're all "anarcho"-communists. Among reliable sources, the claim that Rothbard is not an anarchist is the extreme minority fringe view.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 04:44, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let me explain this one last time. Rothbard doesn't belong on this page--even if he were an anarchist--because the section on him is <b>out of balance' <i>with the subject of the page. He has had no influence on</i></b> <i>Anarchism in the United States</i> Above I cited several anthologies on American anarchism published over the past 40 years. I pointed out that AK Press, the largest anarchist publisher and distributor in the U.S., carries NO books by or about Rothbard. I could dig through my library of anarchist magazines for days and not find a reference to Rothbard. The fact that you've spent so much time adding citations to the Rothbard section is evidence that you know that you are engaged in original research on this page. You are attempting to use this page to continue your campaign of using Wikipedia to normalize anarcho-capitalism as a part of anarchism. Anarcho-capitalists have been fighting for years on Wikipedia to insert their original research on anarchism-related pages. We don't even need to talk here about how anarcho-capitalism is a total oxymoron. As I've stated above, there are far more <i>real</i> American anarchists who should be featured on this page. I know that you don't give a damn about facts and sources, but you are simply embarassing Wikipedia here. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuck0_00fb.html" title="User:Chuck0">Chuck0</a> 05:01, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>AK Press is an anti-capitalist outlet. Why would they carry books by or about Rothbard? If you're only looking in anti-capitalist sources, you're not going to find references to Rothbard as an anarchist. Has it not occured to you that it's highly unlikely that someone who calls themself an anti-capitalist anarchist is going to say that Rothbard is an anarchist? Few can put their POV aside and be objective, but some can (because I have sources from honest anti-capitalist anarchists saying that Rothbard is an anarchist). The sources have been provided to you. You don't like they exist, but they do. So, there's nothing you can do about it. The Rothbard section is going to say.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 05:09, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If you claim that Rothbard is an anarchist, then doesn't it undermine your position that the largest anarchist publisher and distributor in North America, <a href="http://www.akpress.org" class="external text" title="http://www.akpress.org" rel="nofollow">AK Press</a>, doesn't carry ANY books by or about Rothbard? AK is very good about carrying the full range of anarchist thought. They also carry tons of stuff by Marxists, communists, liberals, and more. AK Press is so well-respected and carry so many books, that they are a primary distributor for many small bookstores and infoshops. Yet, they carry no Rothbard. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuck0_00fb.html" title="User:Chuck0">Chuck0</a> 17:36, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

I'm still not finding any books by or about Rothbard in the AK catalog. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuck0_00fb.html" title="User:Chuck0">Chuck0</a> 21:39, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Uh, yeah. Duh. It's not real surprising that AK Press doesn't carry books by Rothbard as it is run by collectivist anarchists who oppose capitalism. <a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElodoth_1b3a.html" title="User:Elodoth">Elodoth</a> 16:29, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All anarchists oppose capitalism. That's Anarchism 101. AK Press is widely recognized as the biggest anarchist press and distributor in North America. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuck0_00fb.html" title="User:Chuck0">Chuck0</a> 19:29, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You're just giving your opinion that all anarchists oppose capitalism. That's fine, because that's your POV. But your POV doesn't matter because there are a tremendous number of sources that disagree with you; almost all scholars agree that it's anarchism. The very few scholars that do claim it's not anarchism happen to be anti-capitalist "anarcho"-communists (of course). The beautiful thing about Wikipedia is that it doesn't allow you to push your personal POV that it's not anarchism. The reason AK Press doesn't carry anarcho-capitalist material is because they're anti-capitalists. They're simply not a comprehensive anarchist outlet.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 21:06, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think you have the ability to make valuable contributions to this page. It does appear to have been written primarily by anarcho-capitalists, and good additions from anarcho-socialist voices are needed. Make those and I'll back you up.

Are you interested in a factual entry on this subject, or something that makes a mockery of even Wikipedia's loose factual standards? A factual entry is not something that evolves out of the frantic typing of people with a bizarre take on the subject matter. And as real anarchists have pointed out numerous times on Wikipedia and elsewhere, a small group of "anarcho-capitalist" zealots have been engaged in a long campaign to impose their crazy take on anarchism on Wikipedia.

<p>Chuck, the fact is that in your own book you can define anarchism to mean whatever you want. You can say it means strawberry ice cream if you want. Here, we rely on established scholarly sources, and MANY have been cited for you already to justify the inclusion of *both* individualist and socialist schools of anarchism, as well as to establish Rothbard in particular as an influential 20th century figure among the former. You can define individualist anarchism out of existence in your own book if you want. You may not do that in the wikipedia article. I was hoping you would contribute some positive work to expand the coverage of the social anarchists here, but it seems you have no interest in that, you simply want to remove the inclusion of those you believe are wrong, in violation of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> among other things. My reverts were completely proper and defensible. So please, go ahead, report me.

<dd>My book will have extensive coverage of individualist anarchism, including articles and excerpts from a broad range of anarchist individualist writers and thinkers. But it will be an <b>accurate</b> and <b>factual</b> book which focuses on U.S. anarchism over the past 40 years. Your reverts are ridiculous, because you basically disappeared the facts about U.S. anarchism that I had added to this entry. What knowledge do you have about American anarchism? Have you written any articles for anarchist journals or spoken at any anarchist conferences? I have. I know this subject and people know me to be an open-minded and inclusive person when it comes to anarchists and anarchism. Who are you? What gives you the right to help <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> establish a fantastic mass of misinformation? Do you understand anything about citations? Just because you can cite something doesn't mean that it justifies something being in this entry. As I and others have patiently explained, anarcho-capitalism is a bunch of nonsense believed by a handful of people in the United States. On the other hand, there have been millions of anarchists around the world, almost all of whom have not been anarcho-capitalists. By preventing my contributions to this entry, you are writing these people out of history and out of this subject. As I've also pointed out, <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> has cited sources by non-anarchists. This is problematic because non-anarchist reference sources, books and articles have a history of misrepresenting anarchism and the anarchist movement. Normally, citations for most subjects are credible, not so for most non-anarchist sources on anarchism. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuck0_00fb.html" title="User:Chuck0">Chuck0</a> 01:34, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Those observations make my point about the citations concerning Rothbard. But this completely misses the bigger issue, that including Rothbard on this page, <i>even if you grant that he is an anarchist,</i> is out of balance with what belong on this page. The edits I made tonight, which were vandalized by you and Anarcho-capitalism, were an attempt to flesh out this entry. I re-organized sections, expanded on several sub-topics and added links to a variety of important and relevant anarchist articles. The "External links" section was even skewed towards obscure individualist articles, which may be of interest to the marginal group of anarcho-capitalists who exist, but aren't important enough for this article. The article as it currently stands, is a grossly inaccurate overview of U.S. anarchism. It doesn't even go over the huge amount of anarchist activism that has happened in the last 20 years.</dd>

<dd>My take on anarcho-capitalism as being outside of anarchism is a commonly held position among anarchists who know about anarcho-capitalism. Every anarchist I've ever talked to considers anarcho-capitalism to be an oxymoron or worse. The Anarchist FAQ goes into detail about why anarcho-capitalism is a bunch of hogwash. But you are assisting Anarcho-capitalism in his vandalism of entries on anarchism. I haven't done any digging, but given your assertions, I will have to assume that you are part of the anarcho-capitalist circle which routinely vandalizes Wikipedia and drives away good users.</dd>

If you don't consider the anarcho-capitalists you've talked to as being included in the anarchists you've talked to, such as me, then you're restricting those personal experiences to only include anti-capitalists. I'm an anarchist that considers anarcho-capitalism be anarchism. And all the other anarcho-capitalists, who comprise a very significant amount of anarchists, especially in the United States (which is what this article is about) consider it to be anarchism. And, most scholars who are self-labeled anarchists who are not anarcho-capitalists consider it to be anarchism. And, all scholars who are not anarchists consider it to be anarchism (which is the most trustworthy because they can be more objective).<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 12:24, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I've been an anarchist for over 20 years, have edited several anarchist publications, run the most popular anarchist website, and have attended many anarchist conferences. When I've brought up the subject of anarcho-capitalism with anarchists, they either look bewildered, laugh out loud, or just dismiss the idea out of hand. An Anarchist FAQ is still the best source for explaining why anarcho-capitalism is nonsense.</dd>

Your statement that anarcho-capitalists comprise a significant amount of American anarchists is just absurd. This is a total fantasy. As far as some of us have been able to determine, there are only a handful of anarcho-capitalists. You yourself troll Wikipedia under several accounts, which you are confronted about on a regular basis. As I've pointed out before, the number of anarcho-capitalists in the United States is insigificant.

<dd>This article is about "Anarchism in the United States," not "Anarcho-capitalism in the United States." The number of self-identified anarcho-capitalists is very small. Rothbard might be influential in that circle, but he isn't influential on the much bigger anarchist movement in the U.S. The number of anarcho-capitalists may number in the dozens while the number of anarchists numbers in the tens of thousands. The prominence of Rothbard in this entry is out of whack with his influence on U.S. anarchism. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuck0_00fb.html" title="User:Chuck0">Chuck0</a> 02:26, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My objection as an anarchist and person who knows alot about this subject is that anarcho-capitalism is an oxymoron. The ironic thing is that former anarcho-capitalists agree with me on this point. More importantly, as a Wikipedian, my objection is that this article is unbalanced and in places represents the opinion of just one person. Even if you grant Rothbard and anarcho-capitalists as subjects worthy of coverage in this entry, the sections on them should be smaller than the sections on other anarchist tendencies and personalities. If the anarchist movement outnumbers anarcho-capitalists by 1000:1 or some similar number, shouldn't an article about "Anarchism in the United States" reflect those numbers? If we were talking about an article on a subject like Christianity, for example, most of the article should treat major branches such as the Catholics, Lutherans, Baptists and so on. What Anarcho-capitalist wants here is an article on Christianity which is written by proponents of some obscure sect, like the Satanists or something like "Buddhist-Christians." This article is just unbalanced and inaccurate in parts that have nothing to do with Rothbard or anarcho-capitalism. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuck0_00fb.html" title="User:Chuck0">Chuck0</a> 02:25, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Chuck, it is not an oxymoron for anyone who understands free-market economy. It is in fact very obvious that it is a type of anarchy of the individualistic umbrella. Maybe it is just me... But do one really need to be a scholar to understand basic concepts such as liberty, property and pursuit of happiness? Many left people seem to have the definition all messed up to the point that the words means something entirely different and can only be used to further their goal. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordmetroid_b969.html" title="User:Lordmetroid">Lord Metroid</a> 22:40, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks! This is a start, albeit a very imperfect solution. The problem with freezing this article is that is freezes the inaccurate one that is basically original research and fantasies concocted by Anarcho-capitalism. When this article in unprotected, we'll be back where we started. People like me will be unable to correct this article and improve it, because Anarcho-capitalism is using this article as part of his campaign to use Wikipedia for original research about anarcho-capitalism and its relationship to anarchism. This is an example of one of Wikipedia's biggest flaws, which is that the most dedicated editor will prevail over more rational, normal people who don't have time for this insane edit-warring. Anarcho-capitalism and his pals have already driven away other quality editors. With me, they've run into a mountain which will eventually bury them. It would be good if we could come up with consensus on how to write this article, but this is simply impossible when one of the people involved is a dogmatic zealot with little regard for facts or reality. Wikipedia needs better procedures to deal with this problem. In the meantime, I'm going to go find other anarchists to help me intervene in this situation. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuck0_00fb.html" title="User:Chuck0">Chuck0</a> 06:49, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is not going to go anywhere if you keep falsely accusing me of original research. Learn what "original research" means here. If something is cited, then by definition it's not original research. Original research simply means something that not cited or that can't be cited.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 16:33, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Then let's take a look at how Wikipedia defines original research
<dl>
<dd>"Original research (OR) is a term used in Wikipedia to refer to material that has not been published by a reliable source. It includes unpublished facts, arguments, concepts, statements, or theories, or any unpublished analysis or synthesis of published material that appears to advance a position — or which, in the words of Wikipedia's co-founder Jimmy Wales, would amount to a "novel narrative or historical interpretation."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The last part is what's applicable here. You are engaged in original research, which is Wikipedia's way of saying that you are using Wikipedia to advance your take on this subject matter, which is substantially different than what is commonly accepted by U.S. anarchists and scholars. Remember how I cited those important anthologies which didn't have anything on Rothbard or anarcho-communism? Or the fact that AK Press doesn't carry anarcho-capitalist books. Or the fact that most anarchists would agree that anarcho-capitalism is a marginal part of anarchism, if they recognize its legitimacy at all. The body of anarchist writings shows that anarcho-capitalism is marginal and those writers who do talk about anarcho-capitalism almost always point out that anarchists dismiss the concept or see it as a contentiou s issue. You've also shown a tendency to make some preposterous claims, like that anarcho-capitalists make up most of the anarchist movement. I think everything you've contributed to Wikipedia and your constant edit-wars with other volunteers, confirms the fact that you are using Wikipedia to create a "novel narrative or historical interpretation" about anarchism. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuck0_00fb.html" title="User:Chuck0">Chuck0</a> 00:45, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You're still being circular. You're claiming that anarchists don't consider Rothbard as an anarchist, but you're excluding anarcho-capitalists at the outset from being included in those anarchists. So, what you're saying is meaningless. If one includes anarcho-captalists in the set of "anarchists" then there are many anarchists that consider Rothbard to be an anarchist - that is, virtually all individualist anarchists regard him as an anarchist. Your POV is just that the Rothbard is not an anarchist and not an important one. So you conveniently exclude anarcho-capitalists from the group of "anarchists" that you claim don't consider him to be an anarchist. Then you conclude that anarchists don't consider Rothbard to be an anarchist. It's a blatantly fallacious argument. But, you can't push your POV here, because there are so many sources from anarchists (including pro and anti "capitalist" anarchists and scholars) and non-anarchist scholars that regard Rothard as a notable anarchist - as one of the most notable, if not THE most notable, individualist anarchist.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 00:52, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Again, you continue to push your POV and your original research here. Sure, anarcho-capitalists consider themselves to be anarchists, but how many of them are there? A dozen? Less than 50? Compare that to the millions of anarchists throughout the history of the U.S. who have not been anarcho-capitalists. I would think that an accurate entry on this subject would reflect the reality of American anarchism and not some fantastical revisionism that you are pushing here. You are digging yourself into a deeper hole with your latest comments. You say that "virtually all individualist anarchists" consider Rothbard to be an anarchist. What are your sources? Have you polled all of these individualist anarchists on this question? I think that your statement about individualist anarchists won't stand up to scrutiny. I've read comments by some of them which express anger at being associated with anarcho-capitalism. The other day I was going through my archives and found an issue of <i>Instead of a Magazine</i> which mentions Rothbard. These guys were individualists and they didn't have kind words to say about Rothbard. I'll see if I can dig up the exact quote. But your claims about Rothbard being a notable anarchist are fallacious. I've already disproven this with citations up above. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuck0_00fb.html" title="User:Chuck0">Chuck0</a> 01:14, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

Anarcho-capitalists theorists far outnumber "social anarchist" theorists in the U.S. "Social anarchism" is so passe'.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 01:54, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wikipedia and most reference works have higher standards than relying on "safe bets." Your claims here have no basis in reality. Individualist anarchists are in the minority within American anarchism. I've done polling and surveys and found that the number of people who identify as individualists is fairly low. And if anarcho-capitalist theorists outnumber other anarchist theorists, then why can't I find any of their work in anarchist books and journals? Do they publish using invisible ink in invisible journals. How about if I ask some anarchist archivists about how much publishing the anarcho-capitalists have done in the U.S.? <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuck0_00fb.html" title="User:Chuck0">Chuck0</a> 03:31, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Some individualists not having kind words to say about Rothbard is not the same thing as claiming that he's not notable. Individualist anarchists have always argued amongst eath other. Each one has his own philosophy and thinks his own is the best.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 02:03, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Read the silly "An Anarchist FAQ". Though it's full of bad scholarship and lies, it devotes almost the whole thing to anarcho-capitalism (and creates publicity for it). They think he's notable, even if they don't like him. They claim he's not an anarchist, but then they're devoted anti-anarcho-capitalists so that's to be expected. It's just POV. Social anarchists don't think anarcho-capitalism is anarchism (and often don't think 19th century individualist anarchism is anarchism either). But, one is hard pressed to find an individualist who says Rothbard wasn't an anarchist. Of course he was. But again, it doesn't matter what self-styled "anarchists" think if they haven't published a work. There are plenty of sources from published anarchist scholars (including pro and anti "capitalist" anarchists) and non-anarchist scholars that regard Rothard as a notable anarchist - as one of the most notable, if not THE most notable, individualist anarchist<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 02:07, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Silly? Really? Iain and others have spent 10 years on that work. It is well-sourced, drawing information and content from a wide variety of anarchists and anarchist publications. It does devote some of its content to debunking anarcho-capitalism, but that is a product of its origins. The FAQ was started in part to refute the anarcho-capitalists that the anarchist movement discovered in the mid 1990s. Most of us had never heard of anarcho-capitalism before a few nutcases started spewing that nonsense on the Internet. Some of us at the time dismissed the anarcho-capitalists as a handful of Americans who were familiar with American libertarianism but were ignorant of what anarchism is about. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuck0_00fb.html" title="User:Chuck0">Chuck0</a> 03:31, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think that one of the ways that this dispute could be resolved is by mentioning Murray Rothbard in a similar way to Ward Churchill is. Something like: "Murray Rothbard considered his anarcho-capitalist ideas to be in line with anarchist thought." I will say this--the guy wrote the libertarian manifesto. While he might of considered his ideas in line with anarchism, he didn't seem to define himself as an anarchist. Or he would have written the anarchist manifesto. or you could even say instead "Many individualist anarchists look to Murray Rothbards writings and consider him an anarchist." BTW, I hope we don't start equating libertarians with anarchists, because libertarians are crazy--and that is my own original research.<a href="../../../b/u/t/User%7EButterflyvertigo_a195.html" title="User:Butterflyvertigo">Butterflyvertigo</a> 02:12, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, Rothbard did consider himself to be an "anarchist," - not just "in line with anarchist thought." He thought anarcho-capitalism was the pure anarchism. And it's not just that he thought himself an anarchist. So, do tons of sources. Anarchism, as ordinarily defined, is simply opposition to the existence of a state. So, of course the sources say he was an anarchist. Each anarchist has his own philosophy beyond that basic requirement. The problem is that each type of anarchism thinks theirs is the true anarchism, so they argue that the other type isn't a true type of anarchism. It's just POV wars. For example, my position is that social anarchism is not true anarchism (but of course I don't push that POV in articles). Chuck0 wants to delete the section because he's POV pushing his POV that anarcho-capitalism is not true anarchism.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 02:14, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I am not pushing my vision of "true anarchism" here. True anarchism is not even an issue. I'm interested in making sure that this is a fair and accurate article. I'm widely known within the anarchist movement as a "big tent anarchist," which means that I think that anarchism is made up of many different strains and that anarchism should be as inclusive as possible. The Infoshop.org website is a good example of my approach towards anarchism--the 32 varieties of anarchism are welcome there.</dd>
<dd>I'm pretty open-minded about what constitutes anarchism. I even see the mutualists as being part of anarchism. A mutualist is what you should really be calling yourself, not the oxymoron known as "anarcho-capitalism." As anarchists have pointed out, anarcho-capitalism is a contradiction because anarchism opposes capitalism and the state. You simply can't have capitalism without the state. How are you going to force people to be wage slaves in your anti-statist anarcho-capitalist society? Which free person would volunteer to be exploited in your system? It's just illogical.</dd>
<dd>Butterflyvertigo has offered an interesting compromise based on fairly standard Wikipedia practices. Rothbard coul have his little section at the bottom of the page after the Churchill section. Rothbard could be included in a section on <i>outlier</i> anarchists, in other words, people whose identification as an anarchist is poorly sourced or contested. But Rothbard shouldn't be included on this page until it has more content on the history of U.S. anarchism, notable anarchists, notable projects and publications and so on. I was trying to improve the page the other night before somebody vandalized it and started reverting my changes. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuck0_00fb.html" title="User:Chuck0">Chuck0</a> 03:21, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If you think I should call myself a mutualist instead of an anarcho-capitalist, that shows how little you know about anarchism. Mutualists have a normative labor theory of value. Anarcho-capitalists don't. Therefore, mutualists think people should by paid according to labor instead of how much someone else subjectively values their labor. They erroneously think people are being "exploited" because they're not receiving an amount of money commensurate with their labor. And, mutualists believe it is OK to steal land and homes that someone purchased or transformed through labor if the person chooses not to use them. Anarcho-capitalism is definitely not mutualism. And, anarcho-capitalists do not seek to "force people to be wage slaves." Wage payers don't force people to work. They simply offer someone the opportunity to earn money. Take it or leave it. Of course you can have capitalism (private ownership of the means of production and a free market) without a state. As to your offer, I don't accept your offer to represent Rothbard like that. Rothbard is just too notable to be relegated to a section portaying him as if he's not. He's not an "outlier." He's right there in the middle of it. He's the most famous of all the modern individaulist anarchists. The sources are there.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 04:12, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If you think that you can have capitalism without the state, you are seriously deluded. Capitalism requires the state in order to function. I could cite the voluminous number of writers who have pointed that out over the past 150 years, including Marx and Bakunin. If you want some kind of economy with trade, but without the state, then you don't want capitalism. Capitalism is a system of exploitation of workers. It's a lot more than that, but I don't need to go over the basics of capitalism on a talk page. If you consider yourself to be a libertarian, then you have to oppose capitalism and the state. How can you as a libertarian support a system of exploitation? Again, you are completely wrong about Rothbard. You are engaging in original research here about Rothbard being a notable anarchist. This cannot be tolerated here. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuck0_00fb.html" title="User:Chuck0">Chuck0</a> 16:37, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>What makes you think that you can't have capitalism without a state? Ownership of the means of production would be protected by private defense, as would freedom to trade. Some people would be self-employed, some people would choose to be employed for others for a wage. That's capitalism. As defined in The Merriam - Webster Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged, "an economic system characterized by private or corporation ownership of capital goods, by investments that are determined by private decision rather than by state control, and by prices, production, and the distribution of goods that are determined mainly in a free market." <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 17:15, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dude, you aren't very credible on these topics. I see on your user page that you claim that you are an anti-communist anarchist. I'm sure that most anarchists would laugh at that, if they aren't shaking their heads in disbelief. Anarchism is inherently socialist and communist. That's why most anarchists don't even bother to hypehnate their anarchism with economic prefixes. They understand that anarchism is anti-capitalist and for sharing of economic resources. You claim that the means of production would be protected by private defense. Why would any anarchist or libertarian support such a system? This goes against everything anarchists believe. Private defense forces have a habit of becoming larger systems of coercion, i.e. states. Why would you even have a private defense force in an anarchist society? Are you defending some anti-social dick who doesn't want to participate in the community? What would these forces be protecting? Private personal property? Anarchists aren't against private personal property, but we are against people who amass large amount fo property at the expense of others, i.e. capitalism. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuck0_00fb.html" title="User:Chuck0">Chuck0</a> 17:36, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You keep showing how little acquainted you are with the various philosophies. You seemed to accept that Benjamin Tucker and the other 19th century individualists are anarchists, but they support private defense too. Tucker said, "[D]efense is a service like any other service; that it is labor both useful and desired, and therefore an economic commodity subject to the law of supply and demand; that in a free market this commodity would be furnished at the cost of production; that, competition prevailing, patronage would go to those who furnished the best article at the lowest price; that the production and sale of this commodity are now monopolized by the State; and that the State, like almost all monopolists, charges exorbitant prices." And, he said, it "does not exclude prisons, officials, military, or other symbols of force. It merely demands that non-invasive men shall not be made the victims of such force. Anarchism is not the reign of love, but the reign of justice. It does not signify the abolition of force-symbols but the application of force to real invaders." If anarcho-capitalists are not anarchists for supporting private defense of person and property, then why would the 19th century individualists be anarchists? You have a strange definition of capitalism. You're making up your own definition when you're defining it as "amassing large amount of property at the expense of others." That's not how capitalism is defined. It's defined as private ownership of the means of production and a free market. And, yes, wealth distribution would of course not be equal because it's market economy. The reason you need private defense is to protect yourself from anarcho-communists and others who want to expropriate the legitimately-acquired property of others.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 17:42, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>I'm an anarchist in the 21st century, not the 18th. I really don't care what Tucker said about any of this, there have been lots of anarchists since him who have weighed in on these issues. I know what capitalism is--it fucks me over on a daily basis. I'm just trying to figure out where you really stand on capitalism. It sounds like you are one of those right-wing American libertarians who want to keep your class privilege and property, but doesn't like the government. Anarchists are against capitalism, even the individualists. There are anarchists such as the mutualists who talk about having a mixed economy with trade and currencies, but they don't call themselves anarcho-capitalists.</dd>
<dd>Let me ask you a question: are you a capitalist? Do you own your own means of production? You seem to have a serious disconnect with the practical aspects of libertarianism and anarchism. You come across as somebody who sees this as a semantical game about theory. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuck0_00fb.html" title="User:Chuck0">Chuck0</a> 22:12, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Of course I want to keep my "class and property." Is there something wrong with that?! I have earned my property. I've worked, been paid for it, and purchased it. And you're wrong that individualists anarchists are against capitalism. Anarcho-capitalists are individaulist anarchists that are pro-capitalism is its purest form. And, yes I do own means of production. I've paid for them with my labor. And I'm not going to let any "anarcho"-communist expropriate it. How is capitalism f*ing you over? If it has anything to do with the state interference with capitalism, then it's not a complaint against capitalism but the against the state. Capitalism is defined as a private system, not a state system - private ownership of the means of production and private markets. The state interferes with capitalism. The only thing that can prevent capitalism from happening is the state. The less control that state exerts over an economy, the more capitalist an economy is. The more control a state exerts, the more socialist an economy is. If someone is a real anarchist then they prefer less state control over more state control. And, again, less state control over the economy results in more capitalism. No state control results in pure capitalism, because people naturally want to own the product of their labor (including if that product is a means of production) and engage in trade - they want to engage in capitalism. (Maybe you don't, but you don't have to if there is freedom. You can go set up a collectivist commune with your buddies if you want. And yes you have to buy the land, because stealing is bad. But, you could take state-"owned" land, and that wouldn't be stealing because the state doesn't buy land but steals it, or buys it with stolen money - taxes). I don't know what you call "capitalism," but when I'm referring to capitalism I'm referring to laissez-faire capitalism. Is it your position that the U.S. is laissez-faire capitalism? <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 05:18, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is all off-topic, but with as many lines already spent on it I'll go ahead and throw in my two cents. The largest part of your disagreement stems from using the same word to refer to two different things. When an anarcho-capitalist and an anarcho-communist use the same word, they don't refer to the same things. Until adherents realise that the arguments will be endless.</p>
<p>Both schools stem from a philosophical rejection of coërcion. When an anarcho-capitalist says 'capitalism' he means an economic system based on voluntary exchange. When an anarcho-communist says 'capitalism' he means a system built from the ground up on coërcion. So naturally each school sees the other as non-anarchist or even anti-anarchist.</p>
<p>It's not *merely* a semantic disagreement, because while the 'capitalism' each refers to is different, there are shared characteristics, because each is an idealisation based to some extent on what the rest of the world means by the word. There are fundamental differences that exist behind, and to some degree create, the disagreement on what the word means - but you'll never even approach them until the semantic impass can be transcended.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this is all entirely off-topic to the purpose of editting this article. This is an encyclopædia. It is to be based on neutral reliable sources. It is not the place to debate the finer points of anarchist philosophy. It is the place to work on an article which communicates to the reader from a completely neutral point of view the very highest points of Anarchist philosophy and history. Anarcho-capitalism believes that the anarcho-communists are not real anarchists. He's entitled to that belief, he's entitled to write it and argue it in the proper place. This is not it. He's been around long enough to get his head around that fact, and he knows better to try. Chuck0, on the other hand, is a new arrival who still hasn't quite figured out what the constraints are here, and rushes in removing anarcho-capitalists because of his belief they aren't actually anarchists. This is no more acceptable than it would be for anarcho-capitalist to run in and delete Emma Goldman from the article. That's the issue that needs to be dealt with here - the rest of it may be important to you two personally, but it doesn't belong here.</p>
<p>Oh, and to Chuck0 - pulling in friends to try and back you up won't work. The policy issue is non-negotiable. You appear to have lucked out in that the first admin to get involved didn't take the time to figure out what was going on - he just froze the article and told you two to work it out. That's normal. But if the problem isn't resolved by this, more admins *will* examine the issues involved, and you won't like what happens next. So please, accept the limitations policy put on you here, quit trying to censor the content you don't agree with, and do something positive - like adding some good material on American anarcho-socialists. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArker_a43e.html" title="User:Arker">Arker</a> 06:23, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You keep saying that you have knowledge of anarchism but you keep showing that you don't. For instance, you showed that you thought mutualism and anarcho-capitalism are the same thing when you said I should call myself a mutualist. And you showed that you had no knowledge that the 19th century individualists supported market-provided police, courts, and jails when you said that you believed they were anarchists, because you claimed that anarcho-capitalists were not anarchists because they support private defense. So, no, I don't regard you as knowledge in anarchism. But again, whether you are knowledgeable is not relevant.

<p>I tried to add material about the American neo-conservative movement to a wikipedia article on fascism. My contributions were reverted and I was accused of vandalism. Just because something has some aspects of fascism doesn't make it part of the historical fascist movement according to wikipedia's standards. Just because something has some of the attributes that define anarchism (lack of a state) doesn't make it part of the historical anarchist movement. This article is supposed to be a history of anarchism in the United States, not an overview of all the abstract theories that have been described as anarchist. Lots of dictatorships have claimed to be democracies, yet a wikipedia article on democracy will not mention them because most real democrats would not consider a dictatorship a democracy. I don't think anarcho-capitalists have played any part in the historical anarchist movement. If someone can find examples of anarcho-capitalists contributing to anarchist movements, then the thinkers behind anarcho-capitalism may deserve inclusion. I don't think this is possible because anarcho-capitalism has no history. It's a mid to late 20th century idea dreamed up by capitalist Libertarians.</p>
<p>It is also not a viable theory. Before the development of modern capitalism, it might have been possible to have an anarchist system with private ownership of the means of production because each worker would be a simple farmer or artisan and could own his or her own tools. However, with modern technology, the means of production consist of massive constructions: factories, computer networks, railways, and etc. No individual can build these things on their own, nor produce enough wealth to afford their cost within his/her lifetime. They cannot work these machines by themselves and therefore must work with democratic collectives (anarchism) or under an oligarchy (capitalism). If you allow individuals to own the means of other people's production, then they can dictate how other people work. Control of the labor of others means controlling their means of living. This is inherently exploitive. People will seek to collectively operate their workplaces. They will want some control over their own lives. The only way that owners can exercise their "right" to their property at that point would be to crush the unions or workers councils by force. Max Weber defined government as an entity that claims a Monopoly on the use of force. If capitalists were the only ones with the official "right" to use force, then they would be government. Anarcho-capitalism may look like a modern nation-state, but it would be a system of government, a plutocracy, not anarchy! Delirium of disorder 07:46, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well said! Some of the anarchists I've talked to about this conflict have pointed out that for such a large movement, anarcho-capitalism doesn't seem to exist outside of the theories of a few Internet-based people. There aren't any anarcho-capitalist organizations. No journals. They never table at any anarchist conferences. Their articles are never published in any anarchist publications. They aren't involved in any of the social movements.

<dd>Chuck0: Although Anarcho-capitalism has conceded that anarcho-capitalism is not a social movement and has not had much historical impact, there are anarcho-capitalist journals. In fact, they were the first places that Chomsky's politics were published:
<blockquote>
<p>Anarcho-capitalism, in my opinion, is a doctrinal system which, if ever implemented, would lead to forms of tyranny and oppression that have few counterparts in human history. There isn't the slightest possibility that its (in my view, horrendous) ideas would be implemented, because they would quickly destroy any society that made this colossal error. The idea of "free contract" between the potentate and his starving subject is a sick joke, perhaps worth some moments in an academic seminar exploring the consequences of (in my view, absurd) ideas, but nowhere else. I should add, however, that I find myself in substantial agreement with people who consider themselves anarcho-capitalists on a whole range of issues; and for some years, was able to write only in their journals. And I also admire their commitment to rationality -- which is rare -- though I do not think they see the consequences of the doctrines they espouse, or their profound moral failings. <a href="http://www.zmag.org/chomsky/interviews/9612-anarchism.html" class="external free" title="http://www.zmag.org/chomsky/interviews/9612-anarchism.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.zmag.org/chomsky/interviews/9612-anarchism.html</a></p>

<p>The dispute has not been settled. I am going to edit this article and leave the stuff alone that has been the center of this dispute. I will leave the section about Rothbard alone. If User:Anarcho-capitalism interferes with my efforts to improve and expand this article, we can move this dispute to formal conflict mediation.

<p>In my experience, there can be an important split between class struggle anarchism (aka workerism) (on the one hand) and primitivism and post-leftism (aka lifestylism) (on the other). This mostly splits social anarchists and other socialist anarchists. Jacob Haller 08:05, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>In addition, there can be a three-way split, though the text doesn't completely accurately describe it, between (1) libertarian socialism/social anarchism, particularly communism, (2) the libertarian left, particularly mutualism, agorism, and geoism, as well as the non-mutualist 19th-century individualists (Spooner et al.), and (3) the libertarian right. But (1) and (2) are more alike than (2) and (3) in my limited experience. Jacob Haller 08:05, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Spooner is more like a anarcho-communist than like Rothbard? Is that what you're saying? You can't be serious. <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 14:48, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, from the sources I've seen I don't think there's a consensus on whether non-anarcho-capitalist individualists are left libertarians or right libertarians. This source seems to say that all individualist are on the right: "Usually considred to be an extreme left-wing ideology, anarchism has always included a significant strain of radical individualism, from the hyperrationalism of Godwin, to the egoism of Stirner, to the libertarians and anarcho-capitalists of today." (Brooks, Frank H. The Individualist Anarchists: An Anthology of Liberty (1881-1908). Transaction Publishers, 1994, p. 8) Rothbard considered himself to be on the left, for what that's worth. I think today, left is considered collectivist and right is considered individualist. <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 14:48, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>There are probably "right" and "left" Rothbardians. SEK3 also considered himself on the left, as do most current agorists. The brand new <a href="http://all-left.net/" class="external text" title="http://all-left.net/" rel="nofollow">Alliance of the Libertarian Left</a> and <a href="http://agorism.info/a3/" class="external text" title="http://agorism.info/a3/" rel="nofollow">Agorist Action Alliance</a> certainly emphasize left connections, right down to a considerable overlap with SDS/MDS membership. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 22:20, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Classical liberalism" was on the Left, hence the term "liberalism" as opposed to "conservativism" which was on the Right. So, historically speaking, laissez-faire capitalism is a philosophy of the Left. Business/government partnership and mercantilism was conservativism, and therefore on the Right. That's why Rothbard considered himself on the Left. For some strange reason free-market capitalists are often considered to be on the Right now. They themselves, though, often don't consider themselves to be on the Right or the Left today. The philosophy doesn't change so much as what's considered "Left" and what's "Right" changes over time. <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 22:44, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>We're not talking about abstract associations, really, or distant history. Market anarchists affiliated with, for example, the Movement for a Democratic Society, are "left" <i>presently</i>, and <i>organizationally</i>. Agorism, with its goal of a "movement of the libertarian left," envisions an <i>active</i> engagement with the present left. If you look at the relative "closeness" of factions, I think it's hardly contestable that A3 agorists and other conscious, explicit "left-libertarians" (such as ALL members) are closer to mutualists and geo-libertarians than they are to the sort of "free market capitalists" who would never consider joining SDS/MDS or the IWW. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 02:04, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>How are agorists closer to mutualists than anarcho-capitalists? They don't have a labor theory of value, don't support occupancy and use restrictions on land, and are not money cranks. Agorists are Rothbardians. Konkin described agorists as "strict Rothbardians." If you're a Rothbardian, you're an anarcho-capitalist. Please state a material difference in their philosophy from anarcho-capitalists. <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 14:42, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It's all well and good for you to say that "if you're a Rothbardian, you're an anarcho-capitalist." However, that's not the way a significant number of actual agorists see it. Perhaps this is only semantics. Do <i>your</i> variety of anarcho-capitalists recognize organizations like the SDS/MDS, and radical labor unions such as the Industrial Workers of the World as their logical allies in the struggle for genuinely free markets (whatever you want to call them)? Roderick Long, Brad Spangler, and Kevin Carson all do, as do members of the geo-libertarian Democratic Freedom Caucus, and the new Alliance of the Libertarian Left is an expression of <i>that</i> similarity, which those involved think is <i>much more important</i> than the disagreements about land tenure, or the different emphases with regard to theories of value. Someone like George Reisman, and many of the libertarians I know, obviously doesn't see things that way. Are "anarcho-capitalists" (according to your definition) more like the first group or the second. If you're more like the first, perhaps we should be collaborating, rather than arguing all the time. But I suspect the theoretical issues too important to you, placing you at some distance from the first group.

<dd>I have no interest in buddying up with "International Workers of the World." I suspect they support statist intervention in the form of minimum wages, and other such invasions, and foment class warfare as if capitalists (business owners and investors) are the enemy. I've never heard of the "SDS/MDS." I'm opposed to class warfare, unless the class being fought is parasite class - the state and those who use the coercive powers of the state for enrichment. Business owners/employers who operate as businesses, rather than as seek favors and legal measures from the state to stifle competition, are not my enemy but my friends regardless of the wages they pay. Those who create jobs are doing a service to humanity. Those who loan money for interest are doing a service to humanity, regardless of the interest they charge; people should be allowed compensation for investment risks they take. As far as who I'm going to associate with I can't speak for all anarcho-capitalists, only myself. But who someone associates with is not really relevant. Agorists are anarcho-capitalists, regardless of who they associate with. It's basically just a name change for marketing purposes. I have no disagreement with them at all. I could have easily chose the username "Agorist" and have the same philosophy that I do now, and you're opinion of me would be different. I think the term "capitalism" throws you off. We anarcho-capitalists simply use the normal definition for capitalism, which is a free market economy. Konkin said the goal of agorism is "relations between people are voluntary exchanges — a free market." Me too. There is no difference.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 19:25, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree fully with SEK3's description of the goal as well—as far as it goes. And I consider a number of individuals who choose to call themselves "anarcho-capitalists" close comrades, with philosophies ultimately compatible with my own. Does that mean that there is "no difference" between my philosophy and yours? <i>It certainly doesn't look that way.</i> SDS/MDS is, of course, Students for a Democratic Society/Movement for a Democratic Society. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that you have no knowledge of that organization or, apparently, of the IWW. You seem to get stuck at the level of abstractions. Konkin was explicitly a revolutionary. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 19:39, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I was going to add, if there were a group of anarcho-capitalists that had meeting, I probably wouldn't associate with them either. What could be accomplished? Anarcho-capitalism is an evolutionary thing, that won't be acheived for long time, could be hundred years or more, with the gradual illumination of the human mind. Philosophy works toward that, not meetings and back-slapping. Also, you mentioned <a href="../../../r/o/d/Roderick_T._Long_3fd2.html" title="Roderick T. Long">Roderick T. Long</a>. Long is an anarcho-capitalist. Konkin was not a revolutionary, if you mean violent revolution. He simply believed in black markets in order help wither away the state. I fully support that. That's like David Friedman who thinks that anarcho-capitalism will be acheived my the gradual privatization of things that government has been involved in, eventually resulting in privatization of everything. I will definitely not support a "Democratic" movement. I as an individualist oppose democracy, naturally. I disagree that anarcho-capitalist philosophy is compatible with your own if you're a mutualist. A mutualist by definition thinks that rent and interest, unmatched labor costs, are exploitation, etc, etc. <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 19:48, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Empty wordplay. You oppose <i>a word</i>, "democracy," based on what you think it <i>must</i> mean. And then you attempt to attribute some other quality ("violence") to "revolution," though it should be clear that the movement that advocates "Anarchy! Agora! Action!" isn't a quietist, "evolutionary" one, like your "anarcho-capitalism." The agorists who are involved with MDS (heck, Long is on the board!), and/or support the IWW certainly don't fit your description. BTW, Long seems to be calling himself a "Dialectical Left-Agorist" at the moment. He's also maintaining one of the two ALL websites. Some pesky mutualist is taking care of the other. I think your claim to be "closer" to people with whom you would not affiliate in any active sense is fairly hollow, particularly in light of the active alliance-building going on in what are now increasingly <i>joint</i> agorist-mutualist-geo-libertarian circles. All of this is silly, really. Division among market anarchists does not advance anyone's agenda, particularly if our goals are a long ways off. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 22:09, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Democracy usually means majority rule. I oppose majority rule. That's what I mean when I say I oppose democracy. You can call people by whatever label you want. My philosophy is what it is. You can call it anarcho-capitalism, agorism, whatever. It is what it is. I support a world a person has a right to own his body and the product of his labor as long as he does not use them to aggress against others. That's my whole philosophy in once sentence. Call it what you want. Call it left. Call it right. I don't care. I simply call it anarcho-capitalism. Long and I are in agreement. Mutualists' support for ownership of the product of labor is incomplete. They don't support the product of labor as property if it's labored upon land or buildings. They condone theft of those things. The philosophy is incompatible with anarcho-capitalist philosophy. Maybe anarcho-capitalists and mutualists can work together for some common ends, but eventually they're going to come to that point of conflict. Either people have a right to own the product of their labor or they don't. Make up your mind. (Roderick Long was callig himself an anarcho-capitalist not too long ago. He can call himself whatever he wants. I see you got that off his blog. That looks like a joke to me. I'm in in general agreement with his philosophy, but I call myself an anarcho-capitalist.By the way, see Roderick Long's criticism of mutualism: <a href="http://www.mises.org/journals/jls/20_1/20_1_6.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mises.org/journals/jls/20_1/20_1_6.pdf" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> ) We anarcho-capitalists will allow mutualist activities to exist among mutualists. The problem is, mutualists, won't allow anarcho-capitalist activities to exist among anarcho-capitalists. I'm talking about land and building. Mutualists condone taking over land and buildings that are not in use. Anarcho-capitalists will allow mutualists to contract with each other to allow each other to give up ownership rights of things they purchase if they stop using them. But the reverse is not true. They don't recognize "absentee ownership" as legitimate. Because of this mutualism and anarcho-capitalism are fundamentally incompatible. Mutualists and anarcho-capitalists would be at war, with the capitalists protecting their unused land and the mutualists trying to take it for their own use.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 02:19, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I hope these subthreads improve navigation.</p>
<p>What you <i>suspect</i> about the "International Workers of the World" need not match the position of the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_Workers_of_the_World_366b.html" title="Industrial Workers of the World">Industrial Workers of the World</a>, although some of the language can be off-putting to <i>any</i> market anarchist (abolition of the wage system). Wobbly literature generally leaves plenty of room for different socialist or workerist strains, so it can be rather vague. My first encounters with voluntary socialism (widely scattered) and propertarian socialism were in official or unofficial Wobbly literature (in <i>The Centralia Conspiracy</i>, with Chaplin quoting Lamb):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is only one reason why--they were defending their own legal property against unlawful invasion and attack; they were defending the dwelling place of Britt Smith, their secretary. And they had full right to defend their lives and that property and that home against violence or destruction; they had a right to use force, if necessary, to effect that defense.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chaplin, an anarchist, favorably quoted Lamb, probably to highlight the hypocrisy of the "defenders of property" in the conspiracy. But this shows how often the "Proudhon standard" and the "Locke standard" converge. AFAIK, the general ALL/MLL/market-left-libertarian position basically respects local standards. If some people expect Lockean standards in a mutualist community, or mutualist standards in a Lockean community, and they expect somebody to defend their claims, well, that's their mistake. As for LTV, even Proudhon argued that value was subjective and contractual, and that labor was an approximate limiting factor (long-term price hovering just above long-term cost). Labor creates value, and labor predicts value in stable free markets. As for money-crankery, I suggest reading Tucker or Greene on the subject. They are scathing about real money-cranks (including Greenbackers, and other fiat-money supporters, as well as both gold-only and gold-and-overrated-silver supporters). Mutual banking is not fiat or fractional-reserve banking. It is secured-loan banking. Jacob Haller 06:10, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"If some people expect Lockean standards in a mutualist community, or mutualist standards in a Lockean community, and they expect somebody to defend their claims, well, that's their mistake." No it's not a mistake. I would defend my unused land from being taken over by mutualists. I don't know what you mean by a "mutualist community" and a "lockean community." One shouldn't have to leave his home to enjoy an anarcho-capitalism. Truly compatible systems would allow all individuals to live in the same place. The neighbor on my right might be a mutualist, the neighbor on my left might be a communist. The mutualist would have to respect my right to defend my unused land and buildings from being taken over. I would respect the right of mutualist to contract amongst each other to allow their unused land to be taken over. The problem is, mutualist don't respect a right to own land and buildings that I purchase if decide not to use them. They clearly say that taking those things over by use is legitimate. As far the LTV, "value" refers to "market price," not worth. (I keep seeing people on Wikipedia making the mistake of thinking "value" in LTV and STV refers to worth). The mutualists thought market prices in a free market are proportional to labor exerted (that's the labor theory of value of Ricardo and Smith). The mutualists think state intervention prevents prices of goods and labor from being proportion to labor. When they see people working the same amount getting different pay, or someone working little and being paid a lot, they conclude that someone is being exploited. But we know today that prices are not proportional to labor in a free market. They are proportional to marginal utility. There is no reason to think that someone is being exploited if he's not paid according to how much labor exerted. As for money crankery, Tucker and Green are money cranks. It's totally flawed understanding of money and interest rates. Increasing the supply of money would not bring interests to to zero or near zero. That's not what determines interest rates. And they're wrong to think that the money supply would increase in the first place. If there is no authority regulating the money supply, it is self-regulating and prevents inflation.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 15:20, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Mutualism is not some "quantity theory" of money. The point of a mutual bank is to create the right currency for the job, not simply to make more. The earliest land banks grew out of periods where there was a genuine shortage of circulating medium, but under present circumstances the advantage of a mutual currency would be its relative cheapness and security. As for the supposed conflict between LTVs and marginal utility theory, it should be obvious that the two theories address different questions. You may disagree about the "productivity of capital," which was the question the LTVs most directly addressed. But marginal utility theory simply doesn't address that point. The shift of emphasis to subjectivism does not address that point, and was, of course, merely a shift in emphasis, as subjective elements were well-represented in most of the LTVs. Now, the sort of extreme subjectivism that makes a self-evident "right" out of absentee ownership is, of course, something that mutualists would take exception to. But so might strict proviso-Lockeans. You would certainly have to make a better case for that "right" than you have done here in order for anyone to take it seriously. Oh, and the present economy tells us very little about <i>free markets</i>, as it is conditioned throughout by state intervention. Anyway, off in more interesting forums, the prospects for broad left-libertarian cooperation are improving all the time. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 18:19, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't need to make a better case for "right" to absentee ownershipo. I'm not asking for a right to absentee ownership to be taken seriously. See Long's essay for that, or my essay. I am saying that anarcho-capitalist rights as they conceive them are incompatible with mutualism, because mutualism condones the taking over of property that is not in use. Mutualists and anarcho-capitalists cannot exist in the same community without war ensuing (unless mutualists simply keep themselves to theory). You are hung up on labels. I can see that now. If I could have called myself a "left" agorist, while having the same philosophy I do now. My philosophy is no different from agorism. I certainly don't consider myself on the right. I don't consider myself on the left-right scale at all. You keep showing you know nothing about marginal utility theory when you say "Oh, and the present economy tells us very little about <i>free markets</i>, as it is conditioned throughout by state intervention." We can still see free market in operation. You can set one up in a classroom and do experiments. Prices won't prioritize according to labor exerted, but according to marginal utility. Nobody cares how long you labor to produce a useless product. <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 18:31, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Honestly, I don't give a damn about labels, and have consistently emphasized the way that they distort the entries here. If your philosophy is indeed no different than agorism, then we won't have a problem "after the revolution." But, having enjoyed Konkin's hospitality on the old Movement of the Libertarian Left list, and having played some part in the discussions that led to the creation of the new A3 and ALL, I have my doubts. In any event, what matters are the substantive discussions, which aren't taking place here, and the actual engagements with actual differences in theory, which it seems to me you consistently evade, in favor of some claim about what others "know nothing about." It's absolutely true that nobody cares how long you labor to produce a useless product. Proudhon said as much, as did Greene and Warren. Neither Kevin Carson nor I would disagree. "How long you labor" is, of course, the measure of "amount of labor" that both you and I have already explicitly rejected as the mutualist measure, so I'm not sure what your point is. Mutualism has, with rare exceptions, treated that issue of "amount" in highly subjective terms. You don't seem to realize that the slogan of the labor movement was never "All Labor Creates Wealth!" LTV proponents were answering these objections in the mid 19th century. This stuff is extremely <i>old hat</i>. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 18:57, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>By "how long you labor" I meant how much labor was exerted. You know that from previous discussions. It's not just that people don't care how much labor you exerted when they decide on a price to pay for something, it's that prices in a free market simply don't line up with labor exerted. And, there is no reason to think that they would. The Theory is wrong. Even Ricardo himself said that he was not satisfied with the theory. He didn't believe it himself. My god, economics has advanced since then. You're in the stone ages. Price prioritize according to marginal utility, not labor. And, as I said, that can easily be verified by settting up a free market experiment. And, yes labor creates wealth. But it also destroys it. I can apply labor to something, and in the process turn it into something less useful. The market price is naturally going to decrease, even though more labor was applied. Labor is irrelevant. It does not predict prices in a free market. More important, there is certainly no ethical reason why it should. Why should you receive more income simply because you work harder than the next guy? It's not how hard you work that matters, but how useful to society that is which you produce. It's a caveman-like entitlement mentality to think that you deserve something simply because you work. If you're one of a million burger flippers why would you deserve anything more than what someone was willing to pay you (which is far below "minimum wage"). If you want higher wages with the same amount of labor, choose an occupation which takes the same amount of exertion, and in low supply and society finds useful. It's that ratio that determines prices, not labor exerted. <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 19:13, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I thought Geico had given us all our Cavemen Sensitivity Training, but, whatever, you're missing the point. Mutualism's engagement with the LTVs has not been primarily predictive, and the "prediction" of cost-price convergence is fairly trivial when you understand that the LTVs were primarily a protest against the ability of capital to command labor. Allow me to repeat: nearly all theories that could be called "mutualist" have taken into account the nonproductive character of labor in fields that find no market. This "caveman-like entitlement mentality" is a product of your own active imagination, and was something explicitly rejected by mutualists back in the "stone age." You obviously missed the difference between the slogan "labor creates all wealth" and the notion that "all labor creates wealth." The first is not adequate as anything other than a slogan. The second is that misconception you keep attributing to radicals who explicitly rejected it. Acceptance or rejection of the "productivity of capital" has no bearing whatsoever on a recognition of the predictive power of marginal utility. And in a free market—defined as one in which labor will not be at the command of capital—we certainly might expect that labor would get its just rewards (in a highly subjective sense, no doubt) in the marketplace. That's fairly orthodox mutualism, though the language is more modern. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 19:45, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>"First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win." - Ghandi ... If you can't even recognize that you are lacking information in a field and hence refuse to ask yourself the questions that will lead you to abolish the ignorrance you have swept your view of reality in. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">User:Libertatia</a>, may I ask you, what substantial proof of facts that you have which backs up your argument? Obviously not both views can be correct at the same time. So by showing some facts of what you try to argue is probably a very good idea. Because as we have seen above, opinions alone are not enough to persuade an end to this debate hence arguments needs to be backed up by logical reasoning and facts that strenghten those logical reasoning for the feud to come to a conclusion. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordmetroid_b969.html" title="User:Lordmetroid">Lord Metroid</a> 11:59, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
