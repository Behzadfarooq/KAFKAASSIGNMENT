<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Analog_sound_vs._digital_sound.html" title="Edit section: Main differences">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Main differences</span></h2>
<p>An analog recording is one where the original sound signal is <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modulation.html" title="Modulation">modulated</a> onto another physical signal carried on some media or substrate such as the groove of a <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gramophone_disc.html" title="Gramophone disc">gramophone disc</a> or the iron filings of a <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnetic_tape.html" title="Magnetic tape">magnetic tape</a>. A physical quantity in the medium (<i>e.g.</i>, the intensity of the magnetic field) is directly related, or analogous, to the physical properties of the sound (<i>e.g</i>, the amplitude, phase, etc.).</p>
<p>A digital recording is produced by first converting the physical properties of the original sound into digital information (stored as <a href="../../../b/i/t/Bit.html" title="Bit">bits</a>) which can then be decoded for reproduction. The conversion process can be susceptible to noise and imperfection. However, the nature of the physical medium is immaterial in recovery of the encoded information as long as the individual bits can be recovered.</p>
<p>Accurate, high quality sound is possible with both analog and digital systems. The principal advantage that digital systems have over analog ones is one of lower cost. High-quality open-reel analog tape and related hardware is expensive to buy and maintain. With digital systems, high quality sound output is achievable with very low manufacturing cost and in mass-produced devices (Rumsey &amp; Watkinson 1995).</p>
<p>This is because analog systems require high-quality mechanical and electronic performance all the way through the audio-chain - recording, production, and finally playback by the consumer. Digital systems are only dependent on the electronic performance of the equipment, and because the signal information is conveyed as a digital (binary) code, any noise or distortion generated by the equipment is easier to reject.</p>
<p>Imperfections in the mechanical performance of the analog equipment may cause distortions like <a href="../../../w/o/w/Wow_%28recording%29.html" title="Wow (recording)">wow</a> and <a href="../../../f/l/u/Flutter.html" title="Flutter">flutter</a>. Some of these distortions can be prevented using <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timebase_correction.html" title="Timebase correction">timebase correction</a>, as is done in <a href="../../../v/h/s/VHS_078b.html" title="VHS">VHS</a> tapes. Time-instability in digital systems (<a href="../../../j/i/t/Jitter.html" title="Jitter">jitter</a>) can degrade system performance.</p>
<p>After a signal has been converted into a digital format, application of error-correcting codes helps to prevent data loss and/or corruption. This allows digital formats to have a higher resistance to media deterioration than analog formats. It is possible for poorly produced digital media to result in data loss. <a href="../../../l/a/s/Laser_rot.html" title="Laser rot">Laser rot</a> was most troublesome to the <a href="../../../l/a/s/Laserdisc.html" title="Laserdisc">Laserdisc</a> format, which used digital audio, and was caused by inadequate disc manufacture. There can occasionally be difficulties related to the use of consumer recordable/rewritable compact disc. This may be due to poor quality CD recorder drives or low quality discs.</p>
<p>Unlike analog dubs, digital copies and regenerations are exact clones. They can be made infinitely without degradation, unless <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digital_Restrictions_Management_a2bc.html" title="Digital Restrictions Management">DRM</a> restrictions apply or <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mastering.html" title="Mastering">mastering</a> errors occur. Digital systems have the ability for the same medium to be used with arbitrarily high or low quality encoding methods and number of channels or other content, unlike mechanically pre-fixed speed and channels of practically all analog systems.</p>
<p>There are also several advantages of digital systems that are not related to sound quality but are of practical value. Most digital media have non-sequential (random) access, due to their disk or <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_memory.html" title="Computer memory">memory</a>-based nature. In production, this makes editing it easier. It also allows the listener greater flexibility when playing back recordings. Digital systems have the ability to encode non-audio information into the audio stream such as information about the owner, track titles, etc.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Analog_sound_vs._digital_sound.html" title="Edit section: Noise and distortion">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Noise and distortion</span></h2>
<p>In the process of recording, storing and playing back the original sound wave analogy (in the form of an electronic signal), it is unavoidable that some signal degradation will occur. This degradation is in the form of linear (changes to the amplitude or phase response within a specified passband) and non-linear errors (noise and distortion). Noise is unrelated in time to the original signal content, while distortion is in some way related in time to the original signal content.</p>

<p>A digital recorder firstly requires the input of an analog signal, this signal may come directly from a microphone pre-amp, but any analog audio signal can be converted. Measurements of the signal intensity are then made at regular intervals (<a href="../../../s/a/m/Sampling_%28signal_processing%29.html" title="Sampling (signal processing)">sampling</a>) by the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Analog-to-digital_converter.html" title="Analog-to-digital converter">analog-to-digital converter</a>. At each sampling point, the signal must be assigned a specific intensity from a set range of values (<a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantization_%28signal_processing%29.html" title="Quantization (signal processing)">quantization</a>). In doing this, the original sound wave can now be described using only numbers - as digital information. When the original signal is converted into binary numbers (1's and 0's, called 'bits') further additions of noise and distortion (in the form of digital errors) can be rejected at every stage of processing. <a href="../../../e/r/r/Error_correction.html" title="Error correction">Error correction</a> coding, essential when transferring digital audio over <a href="../../../n/o/i/Noisy_channel.html" title="Noisy channel">noisy channels</a>, helps to eliminate bit errors. When playing back a digital recording, the digital information is converted back into a continuous, analog signal by a <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digital-to-analog_converter.html" title="Digital-to-analog converter">digital-to-analog converter</a>. This electronic signal is then amplified and converted back into a sound wave by a loudspeaker.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Analog_sound_vs._digital_sound.html" title="Edit section: Noise performance">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Noise performance</span></h3>
<p>For electronic audio signals, sources of noise include (unavoidable) mechanical, electrical and thermal noise level in the recording and playback cycle (mechanical transducers (microphones, <a href="../../../l/o/u/Loudspeakers.html" title="Loudspeakers">loudspeakers</a>), amplifiers, recording equipment, mastering process, reproduction equipment, etc). Whether an audio signal is, at some stage, converted into a digital form will affect the how much noise is added. The actual process of digital conversion will always add some noise, however small in intensity.</p>
<p>The amount of noise that a piece of audio equipment adds to the original signal can be quantified. Mathematically, this can be expressed by means of the <a href="../../../s/i/g/Signal_to_noise_ratio.html" title="Signal to noise ratio">signal to noise ratio</a> (SNR). Sometimes the maximum possible dynamic range of the system is quoted instead. In a digital system, the number of bits with which a signal is allowed to have on quantization will have a bearing on the level of noise and distortion added to that signal. The 16-bit digital system of audio CD has 2<sup>16</sup>= 65,536 possible signal amplitudes, theoretically allowing for a SNR of 98 dB (Maes &amp; Vercammen 2001) and dynamic range of 96 dB.</p>
<ul>
<li>Note that a <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decibel.html" title="Decibel">decibel</a> is one-tenth of a <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bel.html" title="Bel">Bel</a>. It is a somewhat strange concept that characterizes the <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logarithmic.html" title="Logarithmic">logarithmic</a> nature of human senses. Now to make it more complex, the amplitudes discussed in this article are voltage levels. To convert a voltage level ratio to a Bel, simply divide them and calculate the <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logarithm.html" title="Logarithm">logarithm</a> to base 10. Then multiply by 10 to get decibels. Unfortunately, <a href="../../../o/h/m/Ohm%27s_Law_3547.html" title="Ohm's Law">Ohm's Law</a> comes into play; the power of the sound is approximately the square of the voltage level. Summary: The human hearing range is around 120 dB. A digital recording has, at best, a range of 20 * log<sub>10</sub> (2 <sup>number of bits</sup>).</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to meet the theoretical performance of a 16 bit digital system, for a 0.5 V <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peak_to_peak.html" title="Peak to peak">peak to peak</a> input line signal, a <a href="../../../p/c/m/PCM_1088.html" title="PCM">PCM</a> (pulse code modulation) quantizer would require an equivalent minimum input sensitivity of just 7.629 microvolts. For an analog recorder, this is equivalent to a 15.3 <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parts_per_million.html" title="Parts per million">ppm</a> sensitivity by part of the whole recording system and medium.</p>
<p>With digital systems, the quality of reproduction depends on the analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion steps, and does not depend on the quality of the recording medium. <a href="../../../o/v/e/Oversampling.html" title="Oversampling">Oversampling</a> single-bit quantizers, based on <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigma-delta_modulation.html" title="Sigma-delta modulation">sigma-delta modulation</a> designs, have less stringent component-tolerance requirements than conventional PCM quantizers, allowing for high performance at low manufacturing cost. In order to approach the dynamic range possible with 16 bits, analog systems may make use of noise reduction systems.</p>
<p>Consumer analog <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compact_audio_cassette.html" title="Compact audio cassette">cassette</a> tapes may have a dynamic range of 60 to 70 dB. Analog FM broadcasts rarely have a dynamic range exceeding 50 dB. The dynamic range of a direct-cut <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vinyl_record.html" title="Vinyl record">vinyl record</a> may surpass 70 dB. Analog studio master tapes using Dolby-A <a href="../../../n/o/i/Noise_reduction.html" title="Noise reduction">noise reduction</a> can have a dynamic range of around 80 dB (Stark 1989).</p>
<p>Typically anything below 14 bits can lead to reduced sound quality, with 80 dB of SNR considered as an informal "minimum" for Hi-Fi audio. However, it is uncommon to find digital media specified for less than 14 bits, except for older 12-bit <a href="../../../p/c/m/PCM_1088.html" title="PCM">PCM</a> <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camcorder.html" title="Camcorder">Camcorder</a> audio.</p>

<p>"Rumble" is a form of noise peculiar to turntables. Because of imperfections in the <a href="../../../b/e/a/Bearing_%28mechanical%29.html" title="Bearing (mechanical)">bearings</a> of turntables, the platter tends to have a slight amount of motion other than just the desired rotation. That is, besides its rotation, the turntable surface also moves up-and-down and side-to-side slightly. This additional motion is added to the desired signal as noise, usually of very low frequencies, creating a "rumbling" sound during quiet passages. Very inexpensive turntables sometimes used <a href="../../../b/a/l/Ball_bearing.html" title="Ball bearing">ball bearings</a> which are very likely to generate audible amounts of rumble. More expensive turntables tend to use massive sleeve bearings which are much less likely to generate offensive amounts of rumble. Increased turntable <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass.html" title="Mass">mass</a> also tends to lead to reduced rumble. A good turntable should have rumble at least 60 dB below the specified output level from the pick-up (Driscoll 1980).</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Analog_sound_vs._digital_sound.html" title="Edit section: Digital dither">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Digital dither</span></h3>
<p>In digital recording, quantization of the original analog signal results in quantization noise. Unlike the noise floor in analog systems, quantization noise is non-random in nature, and is more audibly disturbing. <a href="../../../d/i/t/Dithering.html" title="Dithering">Dithering</a> can be used to hide quantization noise. The use of <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triangular_distribution.html" title="Triangular distribution">triangular</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/Probability_density_function.html" title="Probability density function">PDF (probability density function)</a> dither lowers the SNR of 16 bit from 98 dB to 93 dB <a href="http://digitalsignallabs.com/noiseb.ps" class="external autonumber" title="http://digitalsignallabs.com/noiseb.ps" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Dithering hides quantization noise and adds a small amount of white (random) noise to the original signal. For optimal sound quality, additional dithering may be added as required at other stages of production, and may also be applied in digital-to-analog converters.</p>
<p><a name="Greater_than_16_bits" id="Greater_than_16_bits"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Analog_sound_vs._digital_sound.html" title="Edit section: Greater than 16 bits">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Greater than 16 bits</span></h3>
<p>Each additional quantization bit adds a notable 6 dB in dynamic range, e.g. 144 <a href="../../../d/b/_/DB_0a5a.html" title="DB">dB</a> for 24 bit quantization (24 x 6 = 144), 21-bit (126 dB), and 20-bit (120 dB). To specify a converter's actual performance, tests need to be run on it <a href="http://www.ee.usyd.edu.au/~jimr/pubs/papers/aes97.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ee.usyd.edu.au/~jimr/pubs/papers/aes97.pdf" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Such tests can check for linear and non-linear errors that the converter adds.</p>
<p>One aspect that may prevent the performance of practical digital systems from meeting their theoretical performance is jitter. This is caused by deviations in the sampling of the waveform from ideal performance, and is usually expressed as a time value. Ramdom jitter alters the noise floor of the digital system. It has been shown that a random jitter of 5 ns (nanoseconds) may be significant for 16 bit digital systems (Rumsey &amp; Watkinson 1995). Systems of greater than 16 bits need performances higher than this (lower jitter meaning levels less than 5 ns) to meet their theoretical noise floors. Audibility tests have shown that the detection threshold for random jitter in musical signals is several hundred nanoseconds <a href="http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ast/26/1/26_50/_article" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ast/26/1/26_50/_article" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.</p>
<p>The benefits of using digital recorders with greater than 16 bit accuracy can be applied to the 16 bits of audio CD. This may be done using dither and <a href="../../../n/o/i/Noise_shaping.html" title="Noise shaping">noise shaping</a>. Noise shaping allows the subjective dynamic range of 16 bits to be extended above 93.3 dB.</p>

<p>Introduced by the Dutch company, Philips, in the mid-1960's, the most popular consumer analog tape system is the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compact_audio_cassette.html" title="Compact audio cassette">compact audio cassette</a> tape (often just called cassette). With cassette tapes using a High (Type II) or Metal (Type IV) bias, sound can be duplicated with fairly low levels of noise, typically offering a dynamic range of 60 dB to 70 dB (Stark 1989). The performance of the system can be improved using noise reduction systems. Many cassette tape players offer the Dolby noise reduction system (Driscoll 1980).</p>
<p><a name="Wow_and_flutter" id="Wow_and_flutter"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Analog_sound_vs._digital_sound.html" title="Edit section: Wow and flutter">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Wow and flutter</span></h3>
<p>Wow and flutter are the result of imperfections in the mechanical performance of analog devices. The audible effect of wow and flutter is most noticeable on signals which contain pure tones. For wow, it has be found out that a frequency swing of 0.6% (peak-to-peak), 0.22% (root mean squared r.m.s) may be audible for piano music (Driscoll 1980). For LP records, the quality of the turntable will have a large effect on the level of wow and flutter. A good turntable will have wow and flutter values of less than 0.05%, which is the speed variation compared to the ideal value.</p>
<p>The digital equivalent of flutter is periodic jitter, which is caused by instablities in the sample clock of the converter (Rumsey &amp; Watkinson 1995). The sensitivity of the converter to periodic jitter depends on the design of the converter. Periodic jitter produces modulation noise. In 1991, Dunn attempted to predict how audible periodic jitter is. His assessment used a model of human hearing based on critical band masking theory, with the audio signal intensity 120 dB SPL above the threshold of hearing. This model predicted that modulation noise may be just-audible when the jitter level is quite high (greater than 1 microsecond) at low jitter frequencies (up to around 250 Hz). Note that jitter frequency is the frequency of the periodic jitter and does not mean audio frequency. At higher jitter frequencies, the allowed level of jitter falls off quite sharply. Later practical research by Benjamin and Gannon found that the lowest level of jitter to be audible on test signals was 10 ns (rms). With music, none of the subjects found jitter audible at levels lower than 20 ns (rms) (Dunn 2003).</p>

<p>The frequency response of audio CD is sufficiently wide to cover the entire audible range, which roughly extends from 20 Hz to 20 kHz. Analog audio is unrestricted in its possible frequency response, but the limitations of the particular analog format will provide a cap.</p>
<p>For digital systems, the maximum audio frequency response is "hardcoded" by the <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sampling_frequency.html" title="Sampling frequency">sampling frequency</a>. The choice of sampling rate used in a digital system is based on the <a href="../../../n/y/q/Nyquist-Shannon_sampling_theorem_04ee.html" title="Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem">Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem</a>. This states that a sampled signal can be reproduced exactly as long as it is sampled at a frequency greater than twice the <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bandwidth.html" title="Bandwidth">bandwidth</a> of the signal. Therefore a sampling rate of 40 kHz would be enough to capture all the information contained in a signal having frequency bandwidth up to 20 kHz. The difficulty arises in removing all the signal content above 20 kHz, and unless this is done, <a href="../../../a/l/i/Aliasing.html" title="Aliasing">aliasing</a> of these higher frequencies may occur. This is where these higher, inaudible frequencies alias to frequencies which are in the audible range. To prevent aliasing, it is not necessary to design a brick-wall filter - that is a filter which perfectly removes all frequency content above (or below) a certain range. Instead, a sampling rate is chosen above the theoretical requirement. This allows for a less severe filter to be used. In addition to this, other methods can be used to try and increase performance, for example, oversampling.</p>
<p>High-quality metal-particle cassettes may have a response extending up to 14 kHz (Stark 1989). A vinyl record player can have a frequency response extending to 20 kHz, and unlike the audio CD, does not require a cut-off in response above this. There will be some loss in fidelity on each playing of the disc. This is due to the wear of the stylus in contact with the record surface. A good quality stylus, matched with a correctly set up pick-up arm, should cause minimal surface wear. The low frequency response of vinyl records is restricted by rumble noise (described above). When a CD is played, there is no physical contact involved, and the data is read optically using a laser beam. Therefore no such media deterioration takes place, and the CD will, with proper care, sound the same every time it is played.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Analog_sound_vs._digital_sound.html" title="Edit section: Subjective evaluation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Subjective evaluation</span></h3>
<p>Subjective evaluation attempts to measure how well an audio component performs according to the human ear. The most common form of subjective test is a listening test, where the audio component is simply used in the context in which it was designed for. This test is popular with hi-fi reviewers, where the component is used for a length of time by the reviewer who then will describe the performance in subjective terms. Common descriptions include whether or not the component has a 'bright' or 'dull' sound, or how well the component manages to present a 'spatial image'.</p>
<p>Another type of subjective test is done under more controlled conditions, and attempts to remove possible bias from listening tests. These sorts of tests are done with the component hidden from the listener, and are called blind tests. To prevent possible bias from the person running the test, the blind test may be done so that this person is also unaware of the component under test. This type of test is called a double-blind test. This sort of test is often used to evaluate the performance of <a href="../../../a/u/d/Audio_data_compression.html" title="Audio data compression">digital audio</a> <a href="../../../c/o/d/Codec.html" title="Codec">codecs</a>.</p>
<p>There are critics of double-blind tests who see them as not allowing the listener to feel fully relaxed when evaluating the system component, and can therefore not judge differences between different components as well as in sighted (non-blind) tests. Those who employ the double-blind testing method may try to reduce listener stress by allowing a certain amount of time for listener training (Toole 1994).</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Analog_sound_vs._digital_sound.html" title="Edit section: Early digital recordings">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early digital recordings</span></h3>
<p>Analog sound reproduction was already a mature technology when digital recording and compact discs first appeared. Some early digital recordings were criticised for their sound quality.</p>
<p>One explanation for this was that engineers had learned to place microphones in such a way as to improve fidelity when producing analog recordings. Due to the extra resolution of the audio CD, such techniques were no longer appropriate. For instance, violins that once sounded well-balanced on analog (vinyl) disc would sound too aggressive on CD. Other faults in recordings were more noticeable, like background noise. Even so, some recording engineers like <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Renner_%28recording_engineer%29_fe56.html" title="Jack Renner (recording engineer)">Jack Renner</a> of the <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telarc.html" title="Telarc">Telarc</a> record label were more aware of these problems than others, and early on were able to produce recordings of excellent sound quality (Greenfield et al. 1986).</p>
<p>Another possible explanation for the criticism of some early digital recordings may have been due to the design of early digital recorders. At this time, the need for applying dither was not widely appreciated, and recordings made without appropriate dither suffer from signal distortion at low signal levels (Hicks 1995).</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Analog_sound_vs._digital_sound.html" title="Edit section: Higher sampling rates">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Higher sampling rates</span></h3>
<p><a href="../../../c/d/_/CD_4170.html" title="CD">CD</a> quality audio is sampled at 44.1 <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hertz.html" title="Hertz">kHz</a> (Nyquist frequency = 22.05 kHz) and at 16 bits. Sampling the waveform at higher frequencies and allowing for a greater number of bits per sample allows noise and distortion to be reduced further. <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digital_Audio_Tape_65e1.html" title="Digital Audio Tape">DAT</a> can store audio at up to 48 kHz, while <a href="../../../d/v/d/DVD-Audio_05cd.html" title="DVD-Audio">DVD-Audio</a> can be 96 or 192 kHz and up to 24 bits resolution.</p>
<p>With these higher sampling rates, signal information is captured above what is generally considered to be the <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychoacoustics.html" title="Psychoacoustics">human hearing range</a>. Work done in 1980 by Muraoka et al. (<i>J.Audio Eng. Soc.</i>, Vol 29, pp2-9) showed that music signals with frequency components above 20 kHz were only distinguished from those without by a few of the 176 test subjects (Kaoru &amp; Shogo 2001). Later papers, however, by a number of different authors, have led to a greater discussion of the value of recording frequencies above 20 kHz. Such research led some to the belief that capturing these ultrasonic sounds could have some audible benefit. Dunn (1998) examined the performance of digital converters in order to see if these differences in perceived performance could be explained <a href="http://www.nanophon.com/audio/antialia.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nanophon.com/audio/antialia.pdf" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. He did this by considering the band-limiting filters used in converters and the artifacts that they introduce.</p>
<p>Perceptual studies by Kaoru and Shogo (2001) led them to the conclusion that ultrasounds would probably be difficult to perceive, but their study was hampered to some extent by experimental artifacts. A later perceptual study by Nishiguchi et al. (2004) concluded that no perceivable difference could be found between music signals with and without frequency components above 21 kHz. They were, however, unable to say whether or not some subjects could perceive a difference, and felt that further evaluation tests were necessary <a href="http://www.nhk.or.jp/strl/publica/labnote/lab486.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nhk.or.jp/strl/publica/labnote/lab486.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../d/i/r/Direct_Stream_Digital_3c36.html" title="Direct Stream Digital">Direct Stream Digital</a> format, developed by Sony and used in the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Audio_CD_7e91.html" title="Super Audio CD">Super Audio CD</a> (SACD), works quite differently to the pulse-code modulation (<a href="../../../p/c/m/PCM_1088.html" title="PCM">PCM</a>) format discussed in this article. Instead of using a greater number of bits depth and attempting to record a signal's precise amplitude for every sample cycle, a DSD recorder works by encoding a signal in a series of <a href="../../../p/w/m/PWM_8449.html" title="PWM">PWM</a> pulses (of fixed amplitude but variable duration and timing). In the SACD standard, the analog wave is sampled at over 1 MHz and at 1 bit. The competing DVD-Audio format, instead, uses standard PCM instead at variable sampling rates and bit depths, which the very least match and usually greatly surpass those of a standard CD Audio (16 bits, 44.1 kHz). A double-blind subjective test between high resolution PCM (DVD-Audio) and DSD did not reveal a statistically significant difference <a href="http://www.hfm-detmold.de/eti/projekte/diplomarbeiten/dsdvspcm/aes_paper_6086.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hfm-detmold.de/eti/projekte/diplomarbeiten/dsdvspcm/aes_paper_6086.pdf" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>.</p>

<p>Some audio enthusiasts prefer the sound of vinyl records over that of CD, this despite the apparent technical advantages of the digital format. Founder and editor Harry Pearson of <i>The Absolute Sound</i> journal says that "LPs are decisively more musical. CDs drain the soul from music. The emotional involvement disappears" <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1430/is_n5_v17/ai_16368605/pg_1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1430/is_n5_v17/ai_16368605/pg_1" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. Dub producer <a href="../../../a/d/r/Adrian_Sherwood_d0d7.html" title="Adrian Sherwood">Adrian Sherwood</a> has similar feelings about the analog cassette tape, which he prefers because of its warm sound <a href="http://arts.guardian.co.uk/fridayreview/story/0,12102,1049363,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://arts.guardian.co.uk/fridayreview/story/0,12102,1049363,00.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>.</p>
<p>Those who favour the digital format point to the results of blind tests, which demonstrate the high performance possible with digital recorders <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1430/is_n5_v17/ai_16368607" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1430/is_n5_v17/ai_16368607" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>, <a href="http://www.bostonaudiosociety.org/bas_speaker/abx_testing2.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bostonaudiosociety.org/bas_speaker/abx_testing2.htm" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>. The assertion is that the 'analog sound' is more a product of analog format inaccuracies than anything else. One early supporter of digital audio was the classical conductor <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbert_von_Karajan_296a.html" title="Herbert von Karajan">Herbert von Karajan</a>, who said that digital recording was "definitely superior to any other form of recording we know".</p>

<p>Complicating the discussion is that recording professionals often mix and match analog and digital techniques in the process of producing a recording. Analog signals can be subjected to digital signal processing or effects, and inversely digital signals are converted back to analog in equipment that can include analog steps such as vacuum tube amplification.</p>
<p>For modern recordings, the controversy between analog recording and digital recording is becoming moot. No matter what format the user uses, the recording probably was digital at several stages in its life. In case of <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_recording.html" title="Video recording">video recordings</a> it is moot for one other reason; whether the format is analog or digital, digital signal processing is likely to have been used in some stages of its life, such as digital <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timebase_correction.html" title="Timebase correction">timebase correction</a> on playback.</p>

<p>While the words <b>analog audio</b> usually imply that the sound is described using a <b>continuous time</b>, <b>continuous amplitudes</b> approach in both the media and the reproduction/recording systems, and the words <b>digital audio</b> imply a <b>discrete time</b>, <b>discrete amplitudes</b> approach, there are methods of encoding audio that fall somewhere between the two, e.g. <b>continuous time</b>, <b>discrete levels</b> and <b>discrete time</b>,<b>continuous levels</b>.</p>
<p>While not as common as "pure analog" or "pure digital" methods, these situations do occur in practice. E.g. while <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vinyl_record.html" title="Vinyl record">vinyl records</a> and common <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compact_cassette.html" title="Compact cassette">compact cassetes</a> are analog media and use quasi-linear mechanical encoding methods (e.g. spiral groove depth, <a href="../../../t/a/p/Tape.html" title="Tape">tape</a> <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnetic_field.html" title="Magnetic field">magnetic field</a> strength) without noticeable quantization or aliasing, there are <i>analog</i> non-linear systems that exhibit effects similar to those encountered on digital ones, such as <a href="../../../a/l/i/Aliasing.html" title="Aliasing">aliasing</a> and "hard" dynamic floors (e.g. frequency modulated audio on <a href="../../../v/h/s/VHS_078b.html" title="VHS">VHS</a> tapes, <a href="../../../p/w/m/PWM_8449.html" title="PWM">PWM</a> encoded signals).</p>
<p>Although those "hybrid" techniques are usually more common in <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telecommunications.html" title="Telecommunications">telecommunications</a> systems than in consumer audio, their existence alone blurs the distinctive line between certain digital and analog systems, at least for what regards some of their alleged advantages or disadvantages.</p>
