<h2><span class="mw-headline">Changes</span></h2>
<p>I removed the following because these "facts" werew unverifiable (or at least i couldn't verify them)</p>
<ul>
<li>However, Anaheim Hills enjoys the lowest crime rate in the city and one of the lowest in Orange County. Violent crime is virtually non-existent; however, drug problems and petty theft remain as minor issues.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>However, the local high school has decreased in prestige over the last few years mainly to drug problems and the loss of the top students to other school districts, namely <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troy_High_School_2147.html" title="Troy High School">Troy High School</a> in the Fullerton Joint Unified High School District (FJUHSD). While the local elementary and middle schools are excellent, Canyon High has failed to meet the standards of a school in such an excellent community.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Anaheim Hills has excellent places for shopping, most notably the Festival Center in east Anaheim Hills. Other places of interest include Oak Canyon Nature Center, Knowlwood (Voted the Best Hamburger restaurant in Orange County), two movie theaters, an excellent public library, and an excellent choice of foods, including Macaroni Grill, Mandarin Taste, Hibachi Steakhouse, and Wood Ranch BBQ and Grill. In 'n Out and Chipotle appear to be the current trends in fast food.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Anaheim Hills has a reputation of being a quiet and safe, yet exciting place to live. It is an excellent place to live whether you are a teenager or senior citizen. Another plus is that the weather is generally excellent except for a few days in the summer when it can get above 100. The temperature almost never goes under freezing, and snow hasn't fallen in many decades.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
I also added the references section, cited a couple of things, and added a link to a map of the area. In light of these changes, i have removed the POV tag. Not sure who originally wrote this article, but it really did read like a tourism ad.--<a href="../../../a/b/r/User%7EAbruce_a582.html" title="User:Abruce">Alex</a> 20:26, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">POV!</span></h2>
<p>I added POV tag, someone keeps adding blatant POV lines to the article such as "However, the local high school has decreased in prestige over the last few years mainly to drug problems and the loss of the top students to other school districts, namely Troy High School in the Fullerton Joint Unified High School District (FJUHSD).

<dd>It defnitely reads that way! I've made changes in the past that just get removed the next day so i'm not really sure if there's anything i can do to improve the page, as someone seems to have an interest in making sure the page continues to read like a travel brocure. I'm somewhat new here, is there a standard way of dealing with such issues? Actually, at the very moment it looks like someone has cleaned it up...--<a href="../../../a/b/r/User%7EAbruce_a582.html" title="User:Abruce">Alex</a> 22:06, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I honestly didn't see any way to separate the verifiable from the fluff without massive effort. At that point, our booster probably will have added back all the crap we remove.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Changes (May 2006)</span></h2>
<p>I changed the Anaheim Hills section from the junk written by Mike Dillon. Its apparent he has never been to Anaheim Hills. And I was not the original writer when it was in a Travel Brochure state. I think that these changes are fair and unbiased, and actually make sense, if you have ever been to Anaheim Hills. Stop changing it back to the original text because that text was poorly written! <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricsaindon2_e596.html" title="User:Ericsaindon2">Ericsaindon2</a> 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>P.S. The only way we can be sure that it is "fair and unbiased" is if you cite your sources properly. As it is, it seems to be pushing the point of view that Anaheim Hills is so much better and different than the parent city of Anaheim (with a tone that smacks of bias to me). It's possible the sources support most of the "data points", but we can't know unless the sources can be reviewed. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Dillon_27e0.html" title="User talk:Mike Dillon">Mike Dillon</a> 02:01, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"City" of Anaheim Hills</span></h2>
<p>Editors who repeatedly add references to the fictitious "city" of Anaheim Hills are effectivly vandalising this encyclopedia by adding untrue information. There is no seal of this non-existent city. There is no mayor. Anaheim Hills is a neighborhod of the city of Anaheim, and nothing more than that. I'm sure it's a fine neighborhood, but it is not a city. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 19:36, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It isn't just the seal. The map is also fictitious since there is no reference given for the official boundaries of this neighborhood. Without an official reference, we have know way of knowing whether the boundaries of Anaheim Hills were made up by the uploader. The page <i>really</i> should not have {{<a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_City_318f.html" title="Template:Infobox City">Infobox City</a>}} and it definitely should not be in <a href="../../../c/i/t/Category%7ECities_in_Orange_County%2C_California_3928.html" title="Category:Cities in Orange County, California">Category:Cities in Orange County, California</a>. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Dillon_27e0.html" title="User talk:Mike Dillon">Mike Dillon</a> 01:04, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've added the {{<a href="../../../d/i/s/Template%7EDisputed_d59f.html" title="Template:Disputed">disputed</a>}} tag to this article because of the amount of revert warring going on in the last day. Readers have a right to know that this article could be changing under their feet and cannot be trusted until the disputes are resolved and things settle down. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Dillon_27e0.html" title="User talk:Mike Dillon">Mike Dillon</a> 01:58, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well then stop changing its contents. It is all factual, and why should I need to prove that there is a shopping center in Anaheim Hills. I LIVE THERE FOR GOD SAKE, ISNT THAT ENOUGH PROOF. It wouldnt be so disruptive and disputed if you just stopped trying to defy me, so go on to pick a fight with some other innocent Wikipedia user about their article because your unnecessary criticism is really getting old.-EricSaindon2</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, that isn't enough "proof". I'm afraid we'll have to keep "defying" you until you can sort out your references and pro-Anaheim Hills chauvinism. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Dillon_27e0.html" title="User talk:Mike Dillon">Mike Dillon</a> 02:48, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since I ended up intimately involved in the disputes over this article that I don't really care about, I thought I'd summarize the situation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Back in April, somebody started adding paragraphs upon paragraphs of unsourced, biased material to this article. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">User:Will Beback</a>, a Wikipedia adminstrator involved with <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Southern_California_534c.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Southern California">Wikipedia:WikiProject Southern California</a> posted a "heads-up" at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Southern_California_06b3.html#Anaheim_Hills.2C_California" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Southern California">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Southern California#Anaheim Hills, California</a>. Will asked for help from the project's editors with "archeological" editing, so I put it on my watchlist. After looking at the article, I made the <b><a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages">bold</a></b> decision to revert all of the changes instead of putting {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} everywhere.</li>

I reverted his changes as <a href="../../../o/r/i/Wikipedia%7EOriginal_research_757d.html" title="Wikipedia:Original research">original research</a> and for the lack of <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">citing sources</a>. Despite what <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricsaindon2_e596.html" title="User:Ericsaindon2">User:Ericsaindon2</a> has said elsewhere, this was unrelated to sourcing the "location of a store" but was related to two paragraphs of unsourced demographic information.</li>
<li>After I reverted three times (before violating 3RR myself), I put a note on <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">User:Will Beback</a>'s talk page since he was an admin with knowledge of the situation. I added {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">unreferenced</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup-tone_4d35.html" title="Template:Cleanup-tone">cleanup-tone</a>}} to the article, but I didn't revert anything else until the next day. Ericsaindon2 reverted my changes and vandalized my userpage by adding the same two templates to my page.</li>
<li>After another admin (<a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">User:Zzyzx11</a>) got involved, I eventually added {{<a href="../../../d/i/s/Template%7EDisputed_d59f.html" title="Template:Disputed">disputed</a>}} and put a note on the talk page. Ericsaindon2 reverted this again and vandalized my userpage with that template.</li>
</ol>
<p>I basically haven't made any other edits since, leaving the situation to admins. I did add {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} to the "Location in Orange County" claim in the infobox since the map does not make clear what the source of the official boundaries shown on the map are (I believe they were made up).</p>
<p>My fundamental objections are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Unsourced demographic information attempting to support the biased opinion that the neighborhood of Anaheim Hills is "better" than the surrounding city of Anaheim. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricsaindon2_e596.html" title="User:Ericsaindon2">User:Ericsaindon2</a> added links to the article that were intended to be references, but they were actually plain domain names, not full URLs.</li>
<li>The fake "city seal" for Anaheim Hills, created by <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricsaindon2_e596.html" title="User:Ericsaindon2">User:Ericsaindon2</a> (Image:Ahills.jpg and Image:Ahills65.jpg). This "seal" claims a 2007 incorporation/foundation date for the fake "city". There was an earlier fake city seal claiming a 2006 date that was created in April during the first round of problems with this article (probably by the same user).</li>
<li>The inclusion of this article in <a href="../../../c/i/t/Category%7ECities_in_Orange_County%2C_California_3928.html" title="Category:Cities in Orange County, California">Category:Cities in Orange County, California</a>, when it is not an incorporated city.</li>
<li>The use of {{<a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_City_318f.html" title="Template:Infobox City">Infobox City</a>}}, a template intended for use only with incorporated cities.</li>
<li>The use of {{<a href="../../../o/r/a/Template%7EOrange_County%2C_California_1067.html" title="Template:Orange County, California">Orange County, California</a>}}, a template used only on the county's article and the pages of incorporated cities in the county. Until a week or two ago, it was called {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECities_of_Orange_County%2C_California_ac19.html" title="Template:Cities of Orange County, California">Cities of Orange County, California</a>}}.</li>
</ol>
<p>All of these things lead readers to think that "Anaheim Hills" is its own city, not a neighborhood of <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anaheim%2C_California_cba4.html" title="Anaheim, California">Anaheim, California</a>. I hope this explains my position clearly.

<dd><a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Dillon_27e0.html" title="User talk:Mike Dillon">Mike Dillon</a> has correctly summarized the matter, and I agree with his objections. There are many facts that we can write about the district of Anaheim Hills, but we mustn't go beyond what is factual. That includes obfuscate its political situation. Should the neighborhood secede then we can decribe it as a city, until then it is a zipcode, a neighborhood. Intentionally inserting false information is either vandalism or, more politely, hoaxing. Either way it has no place in the project. But factual matters aside, Wikipedia has standards and procedural norms that've been disregarded. Edit warring will not be tolerated.

<li>Never mind. I have tried to delete this comment, but due to the instigation that Mike Dillon keeps putting on every little issue about Anaheim Hills, I have been unable to take this accidental comment off. At first I thought that he was recruiting people, but I have cleared it up, and he was just informing another party of the *issue. At first I thought he was telling uninformed people to just simply sign their name for an issue that they knew nothing about, but I really made an accidental mistake in my representation of what this user was truely doing, and I am sorry. I would take this comment off the page if Mike Dillon didnt keep reinserting it (with the intent to start another quarell like this page doesnt have enough of those)--<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricsaindon2_e596.html" title="User:Ericsaindon2">Ericsaindon2</a> 04:56, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Which one of these is Eric? Anyway, Eric has repeadely supported this convention by moving articles to the "neighborhood, city, state" model.

<li>I have you know that the reference you are making to me is in reality not me. Now you can choose to believe me or not, but I use two names on Wikipedia, ES92808 and Ericsaindon2, so there would be no reason for me to go under an alias other than those two. Plus, my computer code when I am not logged in is different than the one presented there, so unless I was using multiple computers (which would personally be alot of hassle to just impress you people), I couldnt have multiple account/computer numbers --70.237.91.134 07:03, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

The second edit was an edit from 207.200.116.131 that was signed "-Ericsaindon2". Are you saying the two edits weren't logged-out edits from <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricsaindon2_e596.html" title="User:Ericsaindon2">User:Ericsaindon2</a>? Also, since your IP address is controlled by SBC (and the other one by AOL), it is presumably allocated dynamically. This means your SBC address could change occasionally, but the AOL address could change with every page edit (because of the way AOL's outbound connections work). <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Dillon_27e0.html" title="User talk:Mike Dillon">Mike Dillon</a> 07:11, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I see what your saying. I do have AOL,that is how I was able to contact Krista Alton, the editor of that original piece that was unreferenced. A long time ago, before I created an account, I used AOL as a general Wikipedia edit place, but I quickly created a screenname after Will Beback asked me to so that confusion was avoided, so I did. And on another note, almost all of Anaheim Hills residents have SBC Global, so it would not surprise me that another anonomous user had the same ID as I started with. I am sure she will create a new account soon after Will tells her to, just like I did. --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricsaindon2_e596.html" title="User:Ericsaindon2">Ericsaindon2</a> 07:22, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

The common name for Anaheim Hills is, <b>Anaheim Hills</b>, and <i>therefore that should be the name of the article</i>.

<li>"Anaheim Hills, CA" is not "okay" because it lends the status of city to a neighborhood. Like it or not, Americans refer to cities as "city, state". Open any newspaper in the U.S., and you will read this formulation, never "city (state)". Only for the largest and most well-known cities is the "state" dropped. Shameful or not, most sub-city entities in the U.S. on Wikipedia are titled "neighborhood, city, state". There's nothing so notable or special about Anaheim Hills that the title of its Wikipedia article should appear differently. <a href="../../../g/e/l/User%7EGellersen_186d.html" title="User:Gellersen">Denvoran</a> 19:13, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Look up any city in any real encyclopedia and you won't see the Wikipedia <i>original research</i> {city, state} "convention", <i>for good reason</i>. You're right, Anaheim Hills should not appear differently. ALL cities and neighborhood articles should be titled by their most common name, as per Wikipedia convention (except in the case of ambiguities), like any other article, and as in any real encyclopedia. This "convention" wreaks of amateurism and is an embarrassing blight on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerge_Issakov_7435.html" title="User:Serge Issakov">Serge</a> 08:20, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>But the name, city, state setup is stupid because it doesnt make any sense, and that is not what the communities are referred to. I would never walk up to any one and say I live in Anaheim Hills, Anaheim, California, I would walk up to someone ans say I live in Anaheim Hills, California. Now with just that statement, yes it might come off as if Anaheim Hills is a city, but if I do some more explaining, (like the first line of the article does) then there is no confusion. IF AN ARTICLE STATES THAT IT IS JUST A COMMUNITY IN ITS FIRST LINE THEN THERE IS NO CONFUSION, AND NO IFS ANDS OR BUTS ABOUT IT. The fact that it is a community is written all over the article, and if you couldnt figure out that it wasnt incorporated after reading this article than you just shouldnt be on an encyclopedia until you get a brain. There is no possible way that there would be any confusion, and the community, city, state setup is only a solution that would create more controversy, and is totally unnecessary. And, by the way, there are tons of communities, even in Orange County, that dont have this setup. So I dont think that it is an official rule. --70.237.91.134 04:16, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>I am just saying that using things just because they are conventional is not right. I mean we can go on forever in properly naming places, but boundaries need to stop somewhere. It is kind of obvious that Anaheim Hills is in Anaheim, (hints the name). I mean, we could truely go on forever with the proper reference to cities and places and say things like Anaheim Hills, Anaheim, California, United States, North America, Western Hemisphere, Earth, Milky Way Galaxy, but thats not the point, the point is that there needs to be a fine line of where to draw the line in naming conventions, and I think including Anaheim with Anaheim Hills is rediculous because it will lead to arguements of other additions to city and place names. It is totally ridiculous. And PS, my point of reference with the name changes was to show you that the title of An article, in conventional naming terms, would be nearly an entire paragraph, and the details is what the article is for, not the title. So, I dont understand how that could have been interpreted as if I liked the naming convention if I clearly have stated that I did it to prove the ridiculous point that the current naming system comes across as. --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricsaindon2_e596.html" title="User:Ericsaindon2">Ericsaindon2</a> 04:26, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

You have no idea what crap I have been put through with some of the users, specifically on this talk page, so before you go and tattle to Wikipedia about me, and start yet another hate page about me, you should probably get to know me, because right now I could start the same RFC on you. Get a brain, and think for yourself with it, and stop following what I have been portrayed to look like on this site.

<p>This poll has been open for almost a week and no new votes have been added in three days. Reviewing the vote I see six clear "support" votes, one clear oppose, and two conditional oppose votes by IPs who are believed to be Ericsaindon2. I count that as six to two in favor of changing the title to "Anaheim Hills, Anaheim, California". That is amounts to 75% in favor, a clear supermajority. If the two IPs are counted separately that is six to three, 66% in favor, which is still a two-thirds vote. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 04:33, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Can someone please present an argument for including {{<a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_City_318f.html" title="Template:Infobox City">Infobox City</a>}} in this article? It is an infobox intended for incorporated cities and its inclusion here leads to the mistaken impression that Anaheim Hills is a city (in case anyone missed this, it is a neighborhood in the <b>city of Anaheim</b>). Subtle alterations to the infobox to make it look like a neighborhood do not help matters since this infobox is usually only seen on the articles of real cities.

<dd>I noticed that one of the IP addresses just cited an external link to the rdesk.com database.

<p>That is not my address, that is an address of a home in Anaheim Hills, California. The statistics on the page do not reflect the address itself (for the house is worth close to $5,000,000, but refer to the 92807/92808 zip code as a whole). A small $300,000 condominium home would come up with the same price in regards to Anaheim Hills. This reference refers to ALL of the ANAHEIM HILLS area.-Ericsaindon2</p>

<dd>Eric, would you mind addressing why you think {{<a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_City_318f.html" title="Template:Infobox City">Infobox City</a>}} should be used in this article? It is quite misleading to make this article look like a city article. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">User:Will Beback</a> suggested elsewhere that this may be a reason to have a specific infobox for neighborhoods that makes it clear that they are part of a city. Presumably, it would not have all the governmental stuff that make the city infobox look so "official".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, what is your source for the boundaries shown in the map in this article? They should be listed on the image description page (Image:Anaheimhills3.JPG), especially since they likely aren't official borders. I'm assuming you took the borders of 92807 and 92808 and eyeballed the cutoff of the 91 freeway. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Dillon_27e0.html" title="User talk:Mike Dillon">Mike Dillon</a> 04:48, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I dont know how to state my source for the boundaries on the map. I enlarged the Orange County template to match a Rand Mcnally map I have of the Orange County area so that the borders matched up. Then I traced the borders and decreased the image back to normal size. I am not sure how to cite that?-Ericsaindon2</p>
<dl>
<dd>I suppose you would identify the specific Rand McNally publication (which should have an ISBN) and state something like "approximate boundaries added by <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricsaindon2_e596.html" title="User:Ericsaindon2">User:Ericsaindon2</a> from Rand McNally <i>publication name</i>".

<li><b>Oppose</b>. I would only support a neighborhood infobox for Anaheim Hills if it were standardized for all neighborhoods. However, since there is no standard for collecting data within a neighborhood, I see a neighborhood infobox as bulky and misleading. The closest viable option for data collection would be manually adding up census data for each relevant zip code, but that's not feasible for neighborhoods that lie only partially within a zip code, and data involving percentages is subject to compounding error when summed. In any case, the manipulation of such prepared data borders on original research because of its difficulty to verify even when sources are provided. However, I believe that an infobox <i>without</i> numerical data (i.e. one that just indicates what city the neighborhood is part of and maybe what zip codes it contains) would be too small to be practical and regarded as an annoyance by stewards of neighborhood articles far and wide. Therefore I oppose the infobox altogether. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoltras_3970.html" title="User:Soltras">Soltras</a> 08:14, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Newport Coast existed as a census-designated place before 2001. I don't see much of a problem with having an infobox for a CDP, but now that it is part of Newport Beach the infobox should be removed. The situation here is different: Anaheim Hills was not a CDP for which statistics were officially produced - here an effort is being made to "cook up" figures and statistics so that Anaheim Hills can have its very own infobox, where at least with Newport Coast the figures are (assumably) Census data. <a href="../../../g/e/l/User%7EGellersen_186d.html" title="User:Gellersen">Denvoran</a> 15:54, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Oppose</b>. Anaheim hills has no formal boundaries, therefore the map and the statistics are all conjecture. There is no mayor, there is no website, etc - all belong to Anaheim. There's no need for this box, any details which are verifiable about the association can be placed in the text, just like every other neighborhood in America. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 20:18, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Support</b> I support the infobox because it is the only place on the internet where there is no fee for getting the statistics on Anaheim Hills anywhere on the world wide web. For those of you that say it is full of useless information, I have fixed that problem on the infobox preview lower down on this page outlined in yellow. It contains more appropriate community statistics instead of the governmental statistics on the city infobox. Now, I feel that since Wikipedia does have this information, becuase I subscribe to Dataquick, and that it is made avalible for anyone to view, it is very beneficial. Nowhere on the internet can you find so much comprehensive information than as you can on this page for Anaheim Hills, versus an incorporated city where that information is very vocal. It makes it more necessary to put it on a page like this when it is the only place that this information is supplied for free. -Ericsaindon2</li>
<li><b>Support.</b> It's a nice informative box. What difference does it make whether it's an "official" city or whether other communities have one? The information applies and is accurate whether or not papers are filed in some basement that make Anaheim Hills an "official city". Does anyone really think anyone else is going to be "confused" by the fact that Anaheim Hills has a box, but Hollywood doesn't? --<a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerge_Issakov_7435.html" title="User:Serge Issakov">Serge</a> 04:19, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Its actually 3/5, that vote on the AOL user domain was not cast by me. That same domain is used by anyone and everyone unregistered using America Online. But, if you want to start combining votes to devalue other votes, then we can do that too. So get the facts straight before you go and tally incorrectly. And that vote is close enough to make it still considerable.</p>

<dd>Thanks for adding that. What is the authority for this map's boundaries? Does the City of Anaheim have official boundraies for its neighborhoods? From the description it appears that the boundaries are not the same as a Zip code, unlike many neighborhoods. Are there census tracts?

<p>The Anaheim Hills area designated all areas south of the 91 freeway under their Canyon and Hill area General Plan with the city of Anaheim, a more specific governmental representation division for the large city. This area became known as Anaheim Hills when Anaheim bought this part of the city in 1972 from the City of Orange and the Peralta Family Farm. The zip codes are divided between Anaheim Hills and Anaheim because part of the 92807 (north of the 91 freeway) was part of Anaheim during its 1857 incorporation. The 92807 zip code was added upon when the Peralta Land was purchased in 1972 to add on to this zip code. When the zip code far exceeded the recommended the number of residents per zip code, the eastern portion of the area became the 92808 zip code. So that is why and how Anaheim Hills defined its unofficial boundaries. Many maps are avalible, but are either copywrited or costly to download. Anaheim does allow you to purchase the Anaheim Hills General Plan Map at their convention center, but the best way I have found was using a blank map and shading in the areas described in official text. --70.237.91.134 22:25, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

It does mention "West Anaheim", which elsewhere you wrote is not officialy designated. So are you asserting that Hill and Canyon Area is the same as Anaheim Hills, and if so, what is your source? -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 01:51, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That image, Image:L_welcome_pagestack1_006.jpg, appears to be the same as Image:Anaheim Hills 6.jpg. It reads, "Anaheim Hills: Planned Community Association".

<dd>From what I can tell, "Anaheim Hills" is a development within the Hill and Canyon Area, but is not the entire area.

<p>Ok, I will try to clear this up again. The Anaheim Hills Community Asssociation is just one of nearly seven community associations in the Anaheim Hills area (and yes it is the larges of them). ALL areas in Anaheim Hills are under an association, or it is not part of Anaheim Hills according to the outline of the Canyon and Hill area General Plan. Excluding the parts north of the 91 freeway, all of the Canyon and Hill General Plan is Anaheim Hills, but since these areas north of the 91 freeway dont pay one of Anaheim Hills's many association fees, they are not considered Anaheim Hills. I showed you this picture because I thought that you got the impression that Anaheim Hills served as a name for merely nothing. It wasnt to prove the point of its community association, it was to show you that the term Anaheim HIlls does exist. --70.237.91.134 20:31, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, I think you are finally getting it! However, not all areas of Anaheim Hills are under an Association fee, but all areas of the Canyon and Hill Area General Plan do benefit from the Associations paid by these residents. As you can probably assume, Anaheim Hills has tried to reincorporate dozens of times over the years, and I think that since Anaheim Hills fits a model equation for a city after its development over the past twenty years, cityship for Anaheim Hills is not far away.--70.237.91.134 05:04, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks, it's an unusual arrangement, but perhaps increasingly common. Regarding cityhood, I personally doubt we'll see it anytime soon. First, in all of the research I've done I haven't seen any mention of a movement for independence. Second, such a city would have very little sales tax base (the main source of income for most Califorina cities), and so probably would not be economically viable. Bedroom communities don't work as cities. That's my opinion, but it leads me to question any assertions of a meaningingful independence movement. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 07:42, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>These demographics are avalible by using ONLY the 92808 zip codes statistics. Since Anaheim Hills only contains parts of the 92807 zip code, the 92807 zip code cannot be used in a census search. The parts of Anaheim Hills in the 92807 are greatly outnumbered by the other noninclusive parts of Anaheim that contain the 92807 zip code. When the OC Register does statistics and figures regarding Anaheim HIlls, all data can be found on the DataQuick database, although the OC Register does pay alot of money for access to this private organizations information. --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricsaindon2_e596.html" title="User:Ericsaindon2">Ericsaindon2</a> 02:54, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Because like I told you, the counted zip code, 92808, may say 2.1, but you bare not including the WHOLE PICTURE. This sector of the 92807 zip code is nearly .5%, which nulls that 2.1% out. But when looking at the 92807 zip code in its entirety, you can clearly see that the african american population is significantly higher, because the parts of the 92807 zip code that are not in Anaheim Hills have a significantly higher African American population than the 92807 Anaheim Hills parts. This MUST be calculated using neigborhood statistics and not zip code statistics, like I have done. --70.237.91.134 05:16, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are completely wrong. 92807 has a 1.7% statistic for "Black or African American" and 92808 has 2.1% (632 people in 92807 and 418 people in 92808). So basically you've just admitted that you're doing original research since the only way to come up with these numbers is logic that only you know (i.e. not based on the published boundaries of any recognized authority).

<p>Anaheim Hills, like I stated earlier to Will Beback is... I will try to clear this up again. The Anaheim Hills Community Asssociation is just one of nearly seven community associations in the Anaheim Hills area (and yes it is the largest of them). ALL areas in Anaheim Hills are under an association, or it is not part of Anaheim Hills according to the outline of the Canyon and Hill area General Plan. Excluding the parts north of the 91 freeway, all of the Canyon and Hill General Plan is Anaheim Hills, but since these areas north of the 91 freeway dont pay one of Anaheim Hills's many association fees, they are not considered Anaheim Hills. Anaheim Hills does have official boundaries, and is defined by the land movement and purchase in 1972 by the City of Anaheim with Texaco Industries to build Anaheim Hills.--<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricsaindon2_e596.html" title="User:Ericsaindon2">Ericsaindon2</a> 04:37, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ok I see your point. I did not do any complicated math formula, I used DataQuick to solve the demographical makeup of ANaheim Hills. I have changed it to reflect each neighborhood using the Census Map in 92807, and full 92808 statistics, then averaged each number based on the population.

<dd>Let's see: Anaheim Hills is unrecognized as a geographic location by the U.S. Census Dept., the U.S. Postal Service, the state of California, and the city of Anaheim. It's an indistinct neighborhood, and so I think we should avoid detailed demographic and geographic info. Let's just say the area has over 50,000 residents and almost 19 square miles. We will be perfectly accurate in both respects. Also, can we all agree about the P.O.? That screenshot is very odd content. Even if we don't agree, let's at least move it to this page for discussion. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 08:18, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Can we just keep the infobox on the page. I mean at the very top of the infobox I put Community of Anaheim Hills--so you would have to be totally oblivious to think Anaheim Hills is a city at that point, plus the first words in the article state that it is just a community. There is no way you could misinterpret that this is a community, unless you just skipped reading the infobox altogether. Furthermore, the infobox is totally accurate and uses neighborhood by neigborhood census tracts, versus just Anaheim or 92807, 92808 as a whole. I spent alot of time working on this box, and rallying information that I feel approporiate for the infobox. It is not creating any confusion, I mean even in the infobox it states City:Anaheim, even the dumbest person could figure out Anaheim Hills is just a community. Pls, why would you deny people the opportunity of learning everything about Anaheim Hills on one page since everything you research about Anaheim Hills is very scattered, and/or incomplete information. I think that Wikipedia, as it stands now, gives the most comprehensive information about Anaheim Hills, and I have had a couple of personal emails saying that I represented Anaheim HIlls well on this page. Although it may look like a city infobox, I have made it so that its idiot proof, and couldnt be mistaken. Can you just leave it because I know its standard rules for a city to have this box, but the box has totally been customized to fit Anaheim HIlls with the removal of the seal and flag slot, as well as the addition as included in the City of Anaheim. --70.237.91.134 03:56, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Can you people just leave Eric alone! The page reads well, and it is obvious that it is a community for this fact is stated over and over again on the page. Stop using an abusive power that you have and keep blocking him just beacuse he is improving an article. Not everyone will approve it, but it is a good article, and I believe that the infobox is beneficial to the article (because Eric is right about it being hard to find information about Anaheim Hills on the world wide web). You cannot seem to give any reason that the infobox shouldnt be there, unlesss you personally have something against user:Ericsaindon2 or something, and I cannot come up with a reason that it shouldnt be there. He switched all his data over from DataQuick, or whatever its called to meet the ideals of the Census Survey, and even did his calculations neighborhood by neighborhood, which is a timely process, just to gain the approval of other uncooperative editors, and they still arent happy. So what! The infobox was not originally intended for communities, yet it has been totally changed and customized to fit Anaheim Hills as a community, and not as a city.--<a href="../../../2/0/7/User%7E207.200.116.131.html" title="User:207.200.116.131">207.200.116.131</a> 04:26, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is a collaborative effort. Editors who are not willing to honor the input of other users should find a different project. If other editors agreed to the box then your agruments might make sense, but it is inappropriate for Eric to keep re-inserting it over the objections of everyone else. It is also inappropriate to keep moving the title of the article. Eric himself moved several other neighborhood articles to the "neighborhood, city, state" format, so he clearly understands it and is apparently avoiding that format for this article intentionally. As for the demographics, this neighborhood has no official boundaries, so there can be no exact data about it. Vague data would be fine. I hope that when his block expires he will work with the other editors to find a consensus, and then will honor that consensus. As for you, please get a username if you want to have a separate identity. However if this is Eric, please be aware that abusive sockpuppets are not tolerated. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 04:50, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Infobox and Title</span></h2>
<p>It seems that (a) certain contributor(s) is/are trying very hard to assert Anaheim Hills' "independence" and is/are going to great lengths to distinguish and separate it from Anaheim. Posting an "infobox" for the community is misleading and inappropriate. Even <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood%2C_Los_Angeles%2C_California_07ef.html" title="Hollywood, Los Angeles, California">Hollywood</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooklyn.html" title="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a> - probably the two most recognizable "communities" in the country that are parts of cities and not cities of their own DO NOT have infoboxes! Why should Anaheim Hills, which is much less known and far less important than Hollywood or Brooklyn? Using an infobox suggests that Anaheim Hills is formally organized as some sort of municipality, which it is not. Instead of showing the location of the community within Anaheim, which would demonstrate that it is a portion of that city, it shows its location within Orange County - just like the infoboxes of legitimate Orange County cities do. This is misleading! It lists a mayor, suggesting that there is a mayor of Anaheim Hills - this is not true! The infobox supplies irrelevant, "fluff" information - it is clear from other parts of the article that the community is in California, and who cares what time zone a neighborhood is in? Simply slapping "community" on the heading of the infobox does not eliminate these confusions and inaccuracies.<br />
Furthermore, the title of the article as "Anaheim Hills, California" is in the format generally used for independent cities and towns, or for legitimate place names used in mailing addresses. Since "Anaheim Hills, California" is none of these, using it as the title of the article is inconstent and misleading. The article on the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles%2C_California_b493.html" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles</a> district of Hollywood is titled "Hollywood, Los Angeles, California" and the article on the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> borough of Brooklyn is titled simply "Brooklyn". The title of this article should either be "Anaheim Hills, Anaheim, California" or "Anaheim Hills", but not "Anaheim Hills, California".<br />
In light of the above arguments I am removing the infobox and moving the article again. If someone can provide legitimate arguments supporting why Anaheim Hills, among the many tens of thousands of neighborhoods of the U.S., is so exceptional that it merits its very own infobox, please state it here. Likewise, please state why this article should break convention and be titled as {city, state} even though Anaheim Hills is not a city, town, or a postally acceptable place name. <a href="../../../g/e/l/User%7EGellersen_186d.html" title="User:Gellersen">Denvoran</a> 06:02, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is all well and good, but lets get some kind of concensus before just moving the page around...especially since you have put forward two proposals. There are plenty of unincoprorated areas that are listed "place, state" that are not officially towns or cities. I see some logic in the name including the city of which the community is part - but from what I see there is far from any kind of style guide on how to handle this. Another option is Anaheim Hills, California (community) and that has the advantage of easier wikilinks Anaheim Hills, California since you can easily get wikipedia to ignore the info in parens easily - ie include the pipe but no text after the pipe like this: [[Anaheim Hills, California (community)|]] will create a link that is named for the article minus the parens <a href="../../../s/y/m/User%7ESymes_3899.html" title="User:Symes">Symes</a> 10:47, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It seems to me that "Community, State" is primarily used for unincorporated areas outside of a city (or at least not entire contained within a city).

<li>I added an infobox on the demographics portion similar to the one on the Ladera Ranch, Mission Viejo, California Community page to the Anaheim Hills page. I did have to modify it because some information that was avalible for Ladera Ranch wasnt avalible for Anaheim Hills and visa versa. I would like to include the map on this infobox versus the way it sits right now because where it is located right now in the page is not where the location is described. I dont know how to add the map to the infobox lower down on the demographics page, but if someone with more knowledge about doing that could assist me I would appreciate it!--<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricsaindon2_e596.html" title="User:Ericsaindon2">Ericsaindon2</a> 01:58, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Straw Poll New and Modified</span></h2>
<p>I have created a whole new infobox totally custom for communities only including things tht communitites have. It does not include all of that governmental information, but rather focuses on the people and characteristics of a community, which can be determined in some communitites in other ways besides through Census. This one provides a whole new look, and disincludes the city seal and city flags. However, it does include features that are more directed to communities, like unofficial boundaries, and people characteristics to replace governmentl statistics that arent avalible for unincorporated areas. I hope it suits the needs, and I think that it will provide a good addition to the page. Also, it will give Wikipedia a heads up when people are researching Anaheim Hills. It is the only place where statitics are avalible for free about Anaheim Hills, since the source of the infomation, DataQuick, costs money to get the privately researched information. It is more necessary on this page than any other city page, because other cities have that information posted all over the internet, and communities dont have it posted anywhere, so why deprive the public of this valuable information when it is avalible, and can be avalible on Wikipedia?</p>

<li><b>Oppose</b>. The information you refer to can be in the article without an infobox (and currently is). The map could be shown on its own. The problem here, which you still aren't realizing, is that DataQuick's data can't be used because we don't know what they're calling "Anaheim Hills". The fact that Anaheim Hills is unofficial is likely the reason that you can't find information on the Internet. Also, you're probably violating the terms of service for your subscription by reposting this data here. Without a <b>reliable</b> source, this information should not be on Wikipedia. Dataquick is not reliable unless we can confirm the scope and applicability of their data. However, even if we can confirm this, they probably aren't appropriate as a source because that means we're basing the very <i>definition</i> of Anaheim Hills on Dataquick, which is not at all a definitive source of such information. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Dillon_27e0.html" title="User talk:Mike Dillon">Mike Dillon</a> 14:57, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Because those pages dont have a split vote on whether to move it or not like this one does. If nobody votes (like what happened on the other pages) then it can be moved, but there is so much controversy on this page that it should remain unaffected until a clear resolution can be come to. If Mike Dillon decides to start an arguement on another page, like he did on this one, then we can change those back too. --70.237.91.134 04:35, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I added a picture showing the bulk of my description of Anaheim Hills in 1925. I am not sure how to edit this picture because it is avalible for use in public domain, and the original photographer (now dead) has released all rights to the photo. I think it shows the Anaheim and Anaheim Hills area well. I would also like it if some wordings could be changed in the history part to make it sound more "encyclopedic". I was a bit tired when I wrote it so the right words werent coming to mind. It does seem to need a little bit of help in its editing. Oh, and thank you for putting the picture in the infobox whichever editor did that. It looks really good, and doesnt resemble a city infobox in any way. This page is definately starting to shape up. In regards to the name change, please dont, at least for like another week. THerew are good arguements for both sides, and because of that the vote is split. The support votes do have one more than the oppose votes, but the oppose votes have many more reasons to why it should not be changed than support has provided for why it should be changed (rather than it just should just because it is convention). It includes all of the stuff and information that actual cities do, which is more than any other community page shows. I would arguably agree with a statement I read that Anaheim Hills was one of, if not the best and most comprehensive community articles on Wikipedia. Nearly 85% of all community pages are stubs, and nearly none of them can touch the caliber of the Anaheim Hills page has reached over the past few months. Thanks everyone for making Anaheim Hills a revolutionary approach for all communities in the USA to follow, and making it such a prime example for what works (and what doesnt) when it comes to community pages. This page went from the worst to the best in just a matter of months, and everyone that participated should feel accomplished. --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricsaindon2_e596.html" title="User:Ericsaindon2">Ericsaindon2</a> 06:14, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Return of the Infobox</span></h2>
<p>I noticed that an infobox has reappeared on the page. I'm not sure what changes it reflects to address the concerns by those who opposed in the above polls, but I think out of prudence considering the situation here I think it would be wise if for a little while major changes took place after consensus on the talk page. I realize that maybe I haven't made my concerns clear with why I oppose an infobox so I shall do so as clearly as I can:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Anaheim Hills boundary is currently described in the article as follows: <i>"Anaheim Hills is comprised of two zip codes, 92807 which serves the western portions of Anaheim Hills, and 92808 which serves the eastern portion of Anaheim Hills. Not all parts of the 92807 zip code are included in Anaheim Hills. Only those residents that live south of the 91 freeway in the 92807 zip code are in the Anaheim Hills vicinity."</i> The infobox cites the population as 53,997. The sources provided give data based on whole zipcodes, but Anaheim Hills is defined on partial zips. How was this (very precise) figure ascertained? By the current definition of Anaheim Hills boundary, I see no viable way of constructing a population figure unless one can be directly provided by some outside statistics agency.</li>
<li>Similarly, after visiting the referenced sites, I couldn't find the data that was used in the infobox for racial percentages. This may have come from the US Census by adding up the zip codes data, but (aside from the fact that Census isn't identified as a source) the inhibitions of partial zip codes creates a problem here too. Additionally, if the data was added up manually per zip code, great care must be taken with the manipulation of percentages because they are relative values, not absolute (I speak from experience).</li>
<li>My argument extends also to the precise values ascertained for land and water area. I didn't see this information from the sources provided.</li>
<li>How was the median home value calculated? If it was averaged from the participating zip codes, then care must have been taken to account for more or fewer homes from one zip code to the next. (in an extreme example, picture two neighboring zipcodes, 11111 and 22222. In 11111 there is a single home and it's worth $1,000,000. In 22222 there are a ten homes all worth $100,000. The average home value for the area is $181,181, not $550,000 which is the plain average of the two zips.) Hopefully I have made it clear why I am so interested in how the data was constructed.</li>
<li>Finally, and this is on a different vein, I think an infobox for Anaheim Hills even with perfectly correct and well sourced data sets an impossible precedent for other communities because counterpart data for other neighborhoods may be incomplete or just unavailable.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think this is worth repeating: let us refrain from infobox adding until a consensus has been reached. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoltras_3970.html" title="User:Soltras">Soltras</a> 06:18, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I totally agree with you. But all this information can be concluded by doing a neighborhood by neighborhood Census addition (a complicated formula) which has been done for us by DataQuick in this case. They considered all the neighborhoods, the number of homes, the area that the homes comprimised, and the number of residents to determine this statistic. Since Census convinently divies their statistics by community and associations on their map portion (not their statistical portion) Anaheim Hills can be added together (since Anaheim Hills comprises certain neighborhoods and not others, which are defined on the Census maps). Now, if you want, I can supply you with the formulas that they used, and you will come up with the same numbers. --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricsaindon2_e596.html" title="User:Ericsaindon2">Ericsaindon2</a> 06:25, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Compromise</span></h2>
<p>In order to promote peace and reconciliation, I propose that we move the article back to "Anaheim Hills, California". Though the practice of naming articles according to the scheme of "neighborhood, city, state" is very common and practical, it is not a policy. On occasion, some editors have objected strenuously to having their neighborhood article named in that way. While consistency is important in an encyclopedia, the exigencies of collaborative editing are such that sometimes it's virtualy necessary for common practice to give way to individual preference.</p>
<p>This case is slightly different than some because many recent edits sought to portray the district incorrectly as an independent place. Those edits sensitized other editors to claims of independence. However I think we've moved past that stage and there is no longer any question that Anaheim Hills is a part of Anaheim. The article now properly reflects that fact in the text.</p>
<p>If moving the article back to just "Anaheim Hills" will bring peace to the article, and if editors can agree to remove contentious boxes, and unverifiable data, then I think it is worth making an exception to normal practice. This is all too minor to fight about. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 09:50, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>All right. I still support the "AH, A, Calif" format, but my main issue has always been with the infobox. It has reappeared this morning. I still do not know where this information comes from. The sources provided do not give this information (that I could see) and at best they give info broken down by zip code - yet Anaheim Hills is defined on partial zip codes. Ericsaindon2 mentioned something about DataQuick, but it's not listed as a source and when I researched it on my own, I couldn't find in the site where to get data for Anaheim Hills. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoltras_3970.html" title="User:Soltras">Soltras</a> 16:23, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, given the impass we've reached I support this. Will Beback sums it up well. However, I don't want to sound bitter, but shouldn't the magnanimousness expected of the winning party be also expected of the losing minority?

<dd>OK, but I must object to the statement, <b>Though the practice of naming articles according to the scheme of "neighborhood, city, state" is very common and practical, it is not a policy.</b> . It is NOT a "very common and practical" practice ANYWHERE. And to the extent that this unique naming format is used within Wikipedia makes the practice a violation of Wikipedia's own primary article naming rule. --<a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerge_Issakov_7435.html" title="User:Serge Issakov">Serge</a> 17:45, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I agree with the move, but get all of that protection stuff off the page. It looks like your entering some top secret CIA site, and all it is is an Anaheim Hills information page. I cannot promise that the infobox remain off the page (but we will solve that issue after we solve the naming dispute). I dont seem to understand why, if all the facts were verified, that the box cannot remain on the page? Everything was verified, and has sources, and so what if it is not typical for a page to have an infobox! There is no designated community infobox, so that doesnt mean there cant be, it just means that there isnt at this time. Now, since there isnt, the infobox needs to be determined on a page-by-page basis, and it shouldnt come through a straw poll whether it is there or not, but through practicality and verified information. And the straw polls are ianccurate of original opinions because everyone on this page, besides maybe myself, Serge, Adambswanger1 are all working together and all agree about everything because that is standard for admins to do. They dont want to get into a confrontation or they may loose their adminship, so they dont argue, and since they dont argue, they all just agree with eachother, making the polls worthless of original opinion. Now, I am not the one loosing here, neither are any of you, but its those people who rely on Wikipedia for a good source of information that there should be an infobox on the page. It compresses all the demographic facts, and does not include any of that governmental stuff that real infoboxes for cities do. It has facts that are avalible, but take alot of time for people to calculate neighborhood by neighborhood facts like these are. Now how can you deny these people of these facts just because all you admins are backing eachother up, and not truely letting your real feelings out? I have not heard one good reason why the infobox should not be on the page. There is no confusion of if Anaheim Hills is a city, because the infobox is totally modified to just include facts avalible for the area. Now, on this page especially, an infobox is essential because its the only site on the world wide web where someone actually to took the time to go deep into Cenusus records to determine the Anaheim Hills demographics that are verifiable, but are timely to compress. I think that depriving the page of this beneficial infobox would be depriving the people that rely on this site for information on the things they like to look up. Now the only arguement I have heard was that it was big and clunky! Now, just because it is big and clunky doesnt mean that all people that read this article should not be supplied with the information. They are not going to enter the page, and say that box is clunky, I am leaving. No, they will say wow, someone actually took the time to comprise a bunch of Census data just for this page. Like I said, if the deletion of the infobox is a personal attack against me, I am not the one that is loosing, its the readers. And about this page move, I fully support the name, and have wanted it changed to Anaheim Hills, Anaheim Hills, California, or Anaheim Hills (California) from the getgo. I just dont like the Anaheim Hills, Anaheim, California name. So I do support the naming portion of your compromise. --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricsaindon154_82f7.html" title="User:Ericsaindon154">Ericsaindon154</a> 23:46, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

I just want it to be switched from this stupid convention of Anaheim Hills, Anaheim, California.

My guess is that someone during an argument over the naming of a particular community decided to delete that strong suggestion from the <a href="../../../r/u/l/WP%7ERULES_e375.html" title="WP:RULES">Wikipedia guidelines</a> and nobody noticed the deletion. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankVerse_b65f.html" title="User:BlankVerse"><sup><font color="green"><i>Blank</i></font></sup></a><a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankVerse_add2.html" title="User talk:BlankVerse"><sup><font color="#F88017"><i>Verse</i></font></sup></a> 08:11, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In fact, I was hoping that no other community page would end up in such turmoil. A clean black and white community box should be used for ALL communities, and information not avalible for that particular community should be left out (same with adding additional information not on the infobox). I just would hate to see other communities go through so much turmoil. I mean look at this pages conflicts, 13 3rr rule breakings, 1 rfc, 33 pages (printed) of complaining and backstabbing, and a completely split arguement between admins and regular users. I dont think that this war is the way to solve anything, but to make changes so that it can be avoided next time (by adding rules and Wikipedia templates). I hope that you guys can at least support my endeavor to go forward with the new community infobox, and add it to a few pages using the census information on the communities particular zip code. If you just look up the zip codes, all of this information should be there.

<dd>It wasn't "approved". You added it to that page yourself. Not that an infobox needs "approval", but what you're saying is misleading.

<dd>I concur. Ericsaindon2's grossly misleading misstatement of the facts is evidence of bad faith on his part. He also still does not understand that the statistics are inherently unreliable because there is no officially recognized neighborhood boundary. He also does not understand that ZIP Codes are not required to correspond with neighborhood or city boundaries, which causes problems in many parts of the United States and California in particular. --<a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcaesar_34f0.html" title="User:Coolcaesar">Coolcaesar</a> 03:32, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
