<h2><span class="mw-headline">Basic cleanup in "history section"</span></h2>
<p>I cleaned up an edit in the history section where numerous sources where quoted after one paragraph and all but one of the sources quoted had absolutely nothing to do with the paragraph at hand and were taken from previous sources in the article. I changed it so it specified "Great Britain" as the country where many AAS users also used other illegal drugs.--<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidudeman_9722.html" title="User:Wikidudeman">Wikidudeman</a> 01:31, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As I was saying if you look in the sources you will find there is a deal more than just British.. It sounds like you are saying it is the only place where many AS users also use illegal drugs...I don't know</p>

<p>^ Psychosomatics.Psychiatric Complications of Anabolic Steroid Abuse.(August, 2005).</p>
<p>This study makes claims about the so called "Psychiatric complications" with anablolic steroid use. This has nothing to do with the paragraph it's sourced in firstly. Secondly it isn't an experimental study but a review of the literature. Considering the massive amount of contradicting experiments, I see no reason to put this in the article. It's been refuted by the published studies out there. ^ An evaluation of anabolic-androgenic steroid abusers over a period of 1 year: seven case studies.. ^ Bhasin S et al NEJM 1996 ^ Pope et al Arch Gen Psych 2000 ^ <a href="http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/81/10/3754?ijkey=719afd785eeda7585ddc14780b0f47877f722b42&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha" class="external free" title="http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/81/10/3754?ijkey=719afd785eeda7585ddc14780b0f47877f722b42&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha" rel="nofollow">http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/81/10/3754?ijkey=719afd785eeda7585ddc14780b0f47877f722b42&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha</a> ^ <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=8855834&amp;query_hl=20&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum" class="external free" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=8855834&amp;query_hl=20&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=8855834&amp;query_hl=20&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum</a></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Removing link to message board</span></h2>
<p>Skookum. The link you posted is a message board and can't be used as a expert link of anykind. If we were to post a "message board" on steroid use as a link we would use "steroidology" or "bodybuilding.com" as a link. The link you posted is to a site i've never even heard of and it makes no sense to use such a site in the first place.</p>
<p><br />
Wikidudeman 18:37, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I didn't post it, it was already there and I had a good look at it; I'm familiar with the content of the other message boards and this one, at least, was a simple rundown/listing of the drugs available and their effects. And as alluded to elsewhere, I have an aversion to considering the "expert" sources as objective, which they are NOT, despite their pretense to being so. Any body of information which excludes the experiences and knowledge of the 2-million plus user community can't be considered objective in the first place, but the texts of many of the sources cited happen to have very prejudicial statements, and even the purpose/intent of the studies cited is often decidedly subjective/political in tone. And just because somebody has some alphabet soup after their name (M.D., Ph.D., LL.B, M.Sc or whatever) doesn't mean that someone who DOESN'T have that alphabet soup after their name ISN'T. And apparently some experts (like Michael Colgan for steroid use, or Rick Collins for steroid law) aren't welcome as cites/experts because it "might scare other experts away". Stigma in and of itself is subjective, I hope that's obvious. As for the bulletin board in question, it has a more thorough accounting of what's on the market and why people use them than any of the medical studies cited have bothered to get right. IMO this page can't be complete until the knowledge/resources/experiences of the user community is taken into account on a non-prejudicial basis.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 19:13, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>PS and the globalize tag should be restored until the USA-centric tone of the article is expanded/broadened; but that would mean, y'see, dispensing with the anti-user bias of the medical articles (especially JAMA's) which currently dominate the page.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 19:13, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The entire time it has been up I don't think any 'experts' have been attracted to the page and none of the edits done(other than my own) were very comprehensive. So i'm going to remove the expert needed template. Any objections?<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidudeman_9722.html" title="User:Wikidudeman">Wikidudeman</a> 01:11, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, let's see now...you've removed the globalize template, the POV template, and now the experts template. And while I haven't had time to get busy around this page, for a number of reasons, I think you're assuming a lot about the timeframe that other editors contribute on, and also over-valuing your own contributions. Patience, Wikidudeman. And by the way, normally it's up to the person who places the dispute templates to remove them, not an intervenor. And while I don't have time to get into, I do question the validity of many of your rebuttals on this page; including the idea that the page is not USAcentric and the disingenuous request for laws concerning other countries; give your head a shake - because if another country doesn't HAVE steroid laws, or anti-steroid laws, <i>how can they be cited</i>????? And, to put it mildly, just because you, as an American, haven't bothered to research steroid laws even in neighbouring jurisdictions (Canada, Mexico, Jamaica, Bahamas) or in Europe, doesn't mean that it's up to someone else to do that; the USACentric tag was there for a reason; one you apparently aren't aware of or knowledgeable enough about the field to have been the guy to remove it. Simply because it didn't make sense to you, in your USA-centricity? Give your head another shake. It wasn't up to you to remove, and it's not up to you to decide whether or not the experts tag had to go. It should be put back, as should the globalize; as a reminder that the page IS NOT complete, and remains USA-biased, and without expert input other than from alteripse and strengthcoach and yankees 76; my "expertise" comes from experience "in the trenches", and apparently doesn't count; and apparently there's some bias as to certain kinds of experts (Duchaine, Collins, Colgan) being anathema to other kinds of experts (AMA, CMA); which points to a POV taint over all. So put back the three tags you've had the audacity/presumption to remove. They weren't yours to do so.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 01:53, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Where to start? Firstly, <b>I am the one who put all of the tags up to begin with.</b> I put the USA centric tag up, I put the expert needed tag up and sources needed tags up. When I put them up there this page wasn't even a shadow of what it currently is. I've added several dozen sources since then and have removed any trace(that I can find) of USAcentricity. I've asked you numerous times to point out where there is USA bias and so far all you can mention is the fact that laws in other countries aren't mentioned. This firstly isn't bias, and secondly I've asked you to provide sources for them but you haven't. Just because a particuar country has no steroid laws(I'm not aware of any that do) doesn't mean there won't be sources supporting that. On Wikipedia if you have an objection then you must provide sources and examples. You can't just be vague and demand the tags be put back up.<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidudeman_9722.html" title="User:Wikidudeman">Wikidudeman</a> 22:08, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My back's been out of whack for the last week or so, plus my reading glasses got lost, which is why you haven't heard from me about this. "This" being your claim that you put up the "globalize" tag - YOU'RE FULL OF IT!!!! Now I know you've got a disinformation agenda here - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anabolic_steroid&amp;diff=66020784&amp;oldid=66017606" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anabolic_steroid&amp;diff=66020784&amp;oldid=66017606" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anabolic_steroid&amp;diff=66020784&amp;oldid=66017606</a> (26 July, while your FIRST post here was 31 July) proves I put the globalize tag in place, and as I recall the POV tag had been taken off at some point, and I put it back on. You're just bloody full of it, and of yourself, for making a puerile claim like that; I scratched my head when I saw that because I've got good memory and knew I'd placed the tag; thought maybe someone had taken it out, and you'd put it back on, but NOPE I was the guy who placed it. I suggest you apologize for LYING and that you also leave this page for a while as penance; whatever your agenda is it's clear now that you're dishonest and also arrogant as to what you think is what's right and wrong with this page. You don't own the page, and the globalize tag is hereby put back on (if it's not back already) as just because no one's put in international content doesn't mean it shouldn't be here. You're an arrogant fool and I'm glad I was able to prove you are also a stinking liar.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 01:37, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Skookum1, Firstly I put the tag up on this name not my wikidudeman name. I stopped using this name because I didn't like it. Maybe you should think of <b>ASKING QUESTIONS</b> before making <b>baseless accusations</b> about my honesty. I suggest YOU apologize for making baseless accusations against me without even asking questions. Secondly, You can't just add up something because you think it should be added up. You must ASK and DISCUSS the addition of any tags before you add them. That's how wikipedia works. That's how it has always worked. Unless you EXPLAIN why you want these tags up and give SPECIFIC EXAMPLES they don't need to be up here. I am REMOVING the tags until you give EXPLANATIONS and EXAMPLES of what and why you think they need to be there in the first place. Unless you're willing to give specific examples as to why they belong there, You can't continue to claim they belong there. Your claims are baseless and purely rants. If you continue to add the tags to the page without even explaining why they should be there in the first place, I will be forced to report you to an admin for Vandalism.</dd>

Nowhere in wikipedia policy does it distinguish between the one who placed the tags or the one who disputes them. I can remove them regardless of who put them up. That's how wikipedia works. So even though I did add the tags to begin with, It's completly irrelevant. Let's assume I didn't add them. So what? It doesn't matter. I removed them because the person who keeps adding them doesn't(and hasn't yet) given a reasonable explanation as to why they should stay there.<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidudeman_9722.html" title="User:Wikidudeman">Wikidudeman</a> 08:35, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Proposal: Social and Legal Aspects of Anabolic Steroid Use</span></h2>
<p>As a separate article; got the idea from the separate [[Legal aspects of <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannabis.html" title="Cannabis">cannabis</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/a/Health_issues_and_the_effects_of_cannabis.html" title="Health issues and the effects of cannabis">Health issues and the effects of cannabis</a> article; the main article is now scientific/botanical for the most part and spin-off issues have separate articles with only brief summaries; the controversial material around here can therefore have a separate field of play; so likewise with [[Anabolic Steroid]]. For msyelf, my POV issue stands concerning this article, and will be intrinsic in any participation in the other article; not usually citable as medical/scientific study but enough of a body of literature to have some kind of pride of place; subjective experience has a place in the account on this page; the details of legal and socioclinical issues (e.g. the danger of toxic or contaminated supply from unregulated underground production caused by illegalization, the details of the various national policies, be they medical or legal, or whether there are any policies or not; a directory of important user sites also would seem a propos on <i>that</i> page. Silencing or ignoring the user community's knowledge on an open-source encyclopedia does not seem very valid, POV wise.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 06:00, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It was the section on <a href="../../../p/s/i/Psilocybe.html#Social_and_legal_aspects" title="Psilocybe">Psilocybe#Social and legal aspects</a> I was thinking of as a comparison, also (a friend is struggling with addiction and I looked it up because of the new interest in psilocybin as a rehab treatment, as with <a href="../../../p/e/y/Peyote.html" title="Peyote">peyote</a>, <a href="../../../a/y/a/Ayahuasca.html" title="Ayahuasca">ayahuasca</a> and <a href="../../../i/b/o/Ibogaine.html" title="Ibogaine">ibogaine</a>). Also re the list of issues above, the oral tradition and any studies on multiple drug use re steroids and everything from opiates to hallucinogens; a page of drug interactions may already exist, for pharmacueticals to everything else just listed and herbals and what-not; I haven't looked around Wiki enough to know.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 06:29, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Skookum1, Firstly I completly disagree. There simply isn't enough information out there to make a seperate article for the criminal or social aspects concerning anabolic steroid use. Anything there is would fit in this article. Moreover subjective or personal experiences do NOT have a place in this wikipedia article or ANY wikipedia article for that matter. Don't you know wikipedia policies? No original content is allowed. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>] Only references to other credible content or credible sources. And if you reference personal experiences then I will challenge it. Secondly....You need to work on your grammar and sentence structure.

<p>That's quite the claim, considering the two million-plus users out there and the extensive writings on their experiences that THEY have published (but which aren't, for some bigoted reason, citable here). I think you're full of it; and don't go expecting everyone to automatically know that you've decided to use a different one of your multiple personalities. I won't apologize, because it had to do with you switching masks - implicitly, in a debating arena, dishonest and evasive. If you don't udnmerstand that then you're just being disingenuous; why else change your name? "Because you didn't like it?" Right, so everyone else is supposed to automatically ASK your new persona if you're the same as this other persona? Whether you're Wikidudeman or DustinPK it doesn't matter - the globalize template is valid, as is the POV, and the expert - and the edit record shows that I placed the globalize tag. Just because other people don't work on YOUR time schedule doesn't mean you have a right to decide how much time is how much time it takes to globalize something, or wait for an expert to come along. The world doesn't run on wikidudeman/DustinPK's time, and grownups don't have to play with little boys who like to change names in the middle of games.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 17:24, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Skookum1 I'm going to try to be as patient with you as I can possibly be. You believe 'personal experiences' can be used in wikipedia articles? This is false. Wikipedia forbids original research or claims or anything like that. Posting 'personal experiences' that aren't already mentioned in other places on the web or in other sources would be considered 'original research' and thus against wikipedia policy. Espically when these 'personal claims' are contradicted by large amounts of scientific research. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>] ....Also you claim that the tags should remain in the article? Well i've asked numerous times to explain in detail why you believe they should be added. So far you've just put up the "neutrality' template. So I ask you WHY. HOW is the article not neutral? Talk pages are about explaining the conflicts of view. You aren't doing that. So I ask you to explain WHY the Neutrality tag belongs in the article so I can spot the problem and we can possibly fix it.<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidudeman_9722.html" title="User:Wikidudeman">Wikidudeman</a> 03:45, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Constantly readding tags to the article without explaining why they should be added and giving specific examples within the article whereas it would need the addition of a specific tag is against wikipedia policy.

Simply continuing to make edits to the page without adaquetly explaining the reasoning behind the actions is against wikipedia policy and it doesn't help improve this article at all.

<dd>I dont question the neutrality but science version of your stuff. You bluntly put metamorphosis.com and other unrelated sites into external links, you put sister sites' links on a BS article about the opposing arguments for legalization of steroids, which has nothing to do with facts itself just to be able to stick in more links for SEO purposes to commercial links. Neutrality has nothing to do with it. A simple look at your external and reference links and the way you target them show your true goals. Sad really.

<dd>What 'true goals' are you refering to? The metamorphosis site has DOZENS of articles written by credible steroid experts including Rick Collins and numerous doctors and other professionals in the field. Tons of very insightful articles. The link is very educational and detailed. It's not just 'some commercial link'. Did you even take a look at the articles featured on metamorphosis website? The site I featured has over 60 authors with nearly 100 articles on anabolic steroids. I posted the site for that reason and that reason alone. A vast source of information. Do you now understand?

<dd>MKS...I didn't add those links for very specific reasons. steroid.com promotes the purches of anabolic steroids. This is currently illegal and thus a violation of wikipedia policy. It's basically a 'buy steroids' website. None of the websites I linked are illegal sources to buy steroids. anabolics.com doesn't exist. and steroid.com 1.Has half of the articles dealing with steroid use 2.Most of the authors don't have the credentials as the mesomorphosis website and 3. steroid.com has direct links to ways to purchess steroids illegaly which is a violation of wikipedia policy.<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidudeman_9722.html" title="User:Wikidudeman">Wikidudeman</a> 11:14, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Hey ok so by putting a banner ad of anabolic-pharma.com at the top of that articles page mesomorphosis is not encouraging to get steroids.. Yeah, OK. I agree with Steroid Expert in terms of usage of non commercial websites. Because all commercial websites are biased towards steroids monetarily, so they are also for steroid use and so nothing I can possibly get from them can be a neutral point of view.

<dd>That website has random banner ads of any search that has a key word "steroid" in it. That website does NOT sell anabolic steroids. It has a store that only sells bodybuilder DVD's. That's it.

<p>That article is exactly the same way. You give the page of an "authority" lawyer, who happens to be a defense lawyer of illegal activities and advertises himself in claims of expertise in every page. You give the "authority" page of an article who encourages "barely" legal and given the sideeffects highly unethical action of selling steroids. I checked the other sites in question, they are also information sites that also give banner ads to third parties. This is pure hypocracy and nothing but a search engine popularity contest. Real shame. I believe Alteripse and other admins and mods should look into this. <a href="../../../m/k/s/User%7EMKS_51b0.html" title="User:MKS">MKS</a> 14:18, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Your post is a sign of why I think this page may never be NPOV, and point-blank your repeated use of "illegal" here points to the USAcentricity of the article, and your line of thinking - which is part of the "witchhunt" mentality of the War on Drugs, the Canseco Hearings et al. Until some kind of way of representing the perspective of the user community - which obviously Collins does, in part, as well as in court - can be included in the article, its orientation will remain biased. The cannabis and psilocybin and other articles have a much broader, more open-minded range. You're complaining that anyone from the "illegal" side of things even should have a voice; that's utterly POV, and is why I think the lockdown on steroid education caused by the War on Drugs is a dangerous thing; because, aside from its clinical impact, it allows parochial tut-tutters like you to pretend to the high moral ground. Mesomorphosis may have banner ads, but so do other sites linked on other pages (e.g. in travel pages many External Links have private pages supported by banner ads); but mesomorphosis has extensive resources - YES, geared to the user community, but that's a sight better than the "see no evil, cause much evil" idea of a blackout on steroid information. Myself I think that it's <i>specific</i> items in the forums which might be cited here - particular clinical and legal and rehabilitative experiences (rehabilitative from injury by self-medication, in defiance of ignorant and uncaring doctors, as in my case; or as with other older men - I'm 50 - the benefits to quality of life and restored activity and more), or particular medical articles (and LOTS of these sites regularly cite lab research on various subjects) - rather than the whole forums; unless there's a political-neutral steroid site such as there is with erowid.com for recreational drugs. I also think the why and wherefore of each drug, bodybuilding/muscle-growth-wise, should either be in this article, or in a social and legal aspects article; or asteroid culture article if that's a workable title (it's certainly a common term). What I mean by that why and wherefore is the distinctions between the drugs, what they're used for and when, and the "coming off" routines/medications (HCG/ACTH) used. Is this "giving instructions on illegal activities"? In the United States it is, but it's NOT in Thailand and a large number of other countries which haven't yet succumbed to IOC/DEA pressure to illegalize; and therein the USAcentricity part in MKS' attitude - blacklisting a steroid defense lawyer <i>because</i> he's a steroid defense lawyer is not only typical, it's asinine. And oh so USA-centric. yeah, I would like alteripse and other admins to think about this; rationally, and stepping outside the prejudices and biases they've been indoctrinated in by the US medical and policing establishment and the ongoing media hysteria/disinformation about steroids. What's more harmful - broadcasting ignorance as the media have been doing, or communal self-education like the bodybuilding/drug forums have been doing?<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 17:01, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Boy, you're hasty with those tags, aren't ya? What's with that? I'll be brief for now (my back's still bugging me and it's hard to sit up, and I DO have another life, and other wiki areas I've involved in). But from my view (Canada, as well as a user) it's not just the History section that has a USA-oriented content/flavour; it's even in the Distribution section (even after my mention of Canada, added yesterday or the day before); "steroids are imported from...." implicitly, for example, means "to the United States". But what about someone in a country <i>where you don't need to import them OR they're not illegal to import</i>. There are a number of them. "Distribution in the United States/Canada/Britain", "Illegal Production in Canada/Italy/Australia". <i>So many</i> Wikipedia articles authored and debated by Americans go on assuming that the rest of the world isn't reading this stuff, as if only the United States exists or matters, and in this case as if its drug laws are assumed to be the right thing to do (NOT). I'm gathering that Wikidudeman might even be a user, and he should then also appreciate that the views of the user community are not to be slagged out of hand (and to SteroidExpert I say: mesomorphosis is NOT like the other sites you've mocked; it and a few other sites also contain reams and reams of health/clinical experiences that can be cited in general discussions here; the experiential evidence is just as important as any lab/research papers - '<i>especially</i> when the funding of those research papers is generally POV/DEA/IOC (DEA/IOC=intrinsically POV). The idea that steroid use is necessarily bad is a USA projection on reality, and it is something other countries have been pressured into toeing the line with, although up here in Canada we made it criminal becausee the national guilt-fest over Ben Johnson; before that it was like illegally importing aspirin. In Canadam, steroids are "Schedule IV" under the Controlled Substances Act, or wherever in the Criminal Code of Canada, and it's a category created explicitly for steroids because even our whacked parliamentarians couldn't see the point in putting it in Schedule III with marijuana, Schedule II with valium, perc, etc and Schedule I with coke, heroin et al.. But in the US steroids have been branded a "dangerous narcotic" and are in the A-list; and as per a news item which you'll find on www.rickcollins.com as well as mesomorphosis.com (I got it in elitefitness.com's newsletter) the penalties are being upped severely in the United States, with individual pills now being potentially a <i>charge each</i> or something ridiculous along those lines. Witch-hunts, stake-burnings, and necktie parties over something that, let's see, makes you stronger, generally happier, and pretty well forces you to eat right, might get you bald and <i>maybe</i> you'll have some endocrine problems and <i>maybe</i> an enlarged left ventricle. And the guys who made this stuff illegal are stoked on booze and cigarettes and prescription psychotropics.....and why is it illegal? "Because we have to protect our children"??? The thing children need protecting from most is <i>politicians</i>.... Back to int'l laws, Italy changed its steroid laws in advance of the Turin Olympics from simple possession being only the equivalent of a misdemeanour to a criminal charge for even failing a drug test, i.e. for having any steroids <i>in your body</i>. In general, in advance of any Olympic games, IOC pressure on the local officialdom helps perpetrate a witch-hunt; the old easy availability of veterinary steroids in Australia ended in the lead-up to the Sydney Olympics, for example; although years after Seoul you can still buy depoviron and oxymetholone easily in Korea; if you can find it, that is. In Greece the internal steroid market was already sewn up between a few key distributors and certain sports clubs, so there was no need for a crackdown on the pharmacies who still freely sell whatever they have in stock; same with neighbouring Turkey; the legal specifics in each European country I DON'T know, nor in Thailand and India, where steroids are freely available. One interesting thing, by the way, in that countries with copious supplies of hormonal drugs you don't see a lot of beefcake strutting around (well, except maybe in Russia and former Soviet countries); one reason may simply be the food intake these guys can't get (say, in Thailand) or the other being that because the stuff is legal <i>it doesn't become fashionable</i> in the way that contraband substances so automatically do. One thing I do know - when England legalized ecstasy and made it over-the-counter its use dropped off dramatically as kids turned to something else more illicit (DMT at the time). So the point is with the Distribution section and the History section, there's a much broader palette to be written up, and researched, and Wikidudeman's trigger-happiness over the globalize/USA and POV tags is a frustrating waste of mental energy. Scratch your head a bit, Wikiman, and start doing some webresearch on other countries - Japan, China, India, Nigeria, South Africa, Brazil, and so on. Do they have steroid laws, or <i>don't they</i>. And those that don't should be mentioned; it should be not assumed, as North Americans do from having been so thoroughly brainwashed, that steroids <i>should</i> be illegal. That in and of itself is POV.

<p>You've been acting unilaterally and impatiently; those tags were barely up before you went, "gee, I'm gonna take them down now because I don't understand? Any objections?" You're one of those people who pretends to be rational but isn't - a passive-aggressive - and hiding behind Wiki rules when you yourself have assumed "ownership" of this page is hypocritical. And pretending what I wrote is a rant so you don't have to read it and find the bits that ARE relevant (while at the same time claiming there aren't any) is just more name-calling and evasion; typically passive-aggressive once again. I made a start on the globalize/USAcentricity issues in that paragraph; if you're too stuck-up to read it and find them then BUG OFF with removing the globalize/USAcentricity tag.

<p>Recently I just reverted edits done by "Tomsintown" who butchered the entire article erasing entire sections that belong in the article.

This is an obvious POV conflict. Erasing any opposition to the claim Steroids are dangerous in the article imbalances the neutrality of the article.<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidudeman_9722.html" title="User:Wikidudeman">Wikidudeman</a> 15:05, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Minimizing the side effects" paragraph</span></h2>
<p>It reads like a user's manual with some pseudo science thrown in for good looks. Let's stick to verifiable, neutral facts here. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomsintown_915d.html" title="User:Tomsintown">Tomsintown</a> 11:04, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That part of the article contains no pseudo science. And the "Medical disclaimer" was added for warning. I see no problem. Reverted.<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidudeman_9722.html" title="User:Wikidudeman">Wikidudeman</a> 15:11, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Popular misconceptions" paragraph must be removed, its contents redistributed</span></h2>
<p>This reads like a rebuttal from a pro-steroid POV. Frankly, so does much of the remaining article. Pity for an article on such an important issue! The neutrality tag is there for just cause until someone sweeps through this with a big broom (not necessarily steroid-infused big, though).</p>
<p>I suggest another way is found to mention these findings and studies and that the paragraph itself is removed. There cannot be a one-sided rebuttal that writes off criticism as "popular misconceptions". Very very wrong for an encyclopaedia. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomsintown_915d.html" title="User:Tomsintown">Tomsintown</a> 01:01, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Absolute nonsense. NUMEROUS wikipedia articles have sections on urban legends,myths and misconceptions. Having on on Steroids who's reputation is ripe with myths and unscientific legends is paramount to this article. This section to the article may be 'one sided' but only because it's SCIENCE. When presenting scientific facts on wikipedia we don't sacrifice science for NPOV(See evolution article). Even though the article IF ANYHING seems bias against steroid use opposed to for it. If anything, the POV is balanced against steroids and steroid use. Removing these parts of the article makes this page nothing more than an anti-steroid rant, as I and numeorus others see it. When you've got a claim like "Steroids make your penis shrink" as a criticism of steroid use, That's not criticism at all. That's simply false. Presenting false claims in wikipedia as somehow on the same level as scientific facts is NOT what wikipedia is about. You need do do alot of research about wikipedia policy and anabolic steroids before making anymore edits. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidudeman_9722.html" title="User:Wikidudeman">Wikidudeman</a> 15:11, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Then those "myths" should be placed in a paragraph that deals with "debated" or "controversial" points, as you and I both know there are many sources that do claim a connection between steroids and suicide exists. Penis size I'll give you. To only have a paragraph about "popular misconceptions" is to make the whole issue feel as if the issue isn't all that serious after all. It is simply the chosen words that can't be allowed. Quoting sources is good, but you need sources from both points of view. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomsintown_915d.html" title="User:Tomsintown">Tomsintown</a> 15:47, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You must not have read the entire paragraph. We also have a paragraph on 'side effects' from anabolic steroids. You're new to wikipedia and you need to read more articles and see how scientific articles are put together. Read articles such as the <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">Evolution</a> article. That article presents evolution as being absolutely true even though the POV isn't neutral. This is because it's a SCIENTIFIC article. When dealing with scientific articles(Such as this one) you must have a POV favoring the science and not the myth. Anabolic steroids are a topic with TONS of myths surrounding them. This is why that part of the article is so important. Sure there may be 'sources' supporting the claim that steroids cause suicide. But those sources aren't scientific as the article clearly explains. Putting unscientific and baseless sources up would be like putting sources that the earth is flat in the Geology articles. Absolutely absurd and doesn't belong on wikipedia.<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidudeman_9722.html" title="User:Wikidudeman">Wikidudeman</a> 15:54, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>P.S. Don't make anymore edits (Aside from grammar or spelling) to the article until they are completely discussed and agreed upon on the talk page. That's how wikipedia works.<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidudeman_9722.html" title="User:Wikidudeman">Wikidudeman</a> 15:58, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
