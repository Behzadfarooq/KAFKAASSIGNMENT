	    <p>This is a very nice and interesting article, but is it entirely <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>? It seems to lay a very heavy emphasis on the Western theater and on the Tennessee Valley in particular.</p>
<p>Three points might be made (and hopefully can be, by editors who know their Civil War better than me):</p>
<ul>
<li>Richmond, I believe, was the location of the "Tredegar Iron Works", an important weapons factory, so it wasn't entirely a symbolic target.</li>
<li>Northern morale was a major factor in the war--would they manage to keep going long enough for the Anaconda Plan to work? And the long string of failures in the East did indeed take Northern morale very low.</li>
<li>Lastly, I believe the size of the contending armies was generally somewhat larger in the East.</li>
</ul>
<p>Might these points serve as the basis for making the article a bit more balanced? <a href="../../../o/p/u/User%7EOpus33_8708.html" title="User:Opus33">Opus33</a> 03:12, 21 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Talk%7EAnaconda_Plan_2bb0.html" title="Edit section: Blockade Successful?">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Blockade Successful?</span></h2>
<p>The most successful blockade to date? That's a pretty bold statement. While I'm not a Civil War expert, I believe that the blockade was initially unsuccessful. The Union navy only had about thirty ships to block about 190 southern ports. In 1862 nearly all Confederate ships made it through the blockade. It took about two years for the Union navy to build up enough ships to be effective. By 1865 when the blockade was most successful, the Union navy was still only blocking about half of the Confederate blockade runners. While this still severely hindered the south, I wouldn't call it the most successful blockade to date.</p>
<p>I'm also fairly certain that the price of cotton overseas went down instead of up during the war. Britain and France refused to recognise the Confederacy of the southern states and as a result the south refused to sell cotton to them. But this tactic was unsuccessful and Britain and France instead turned to Egypt and India as their source of cotton. By the time the south realized that their tactic was not effective and lifted the embargo, Britain and France would no longer buy their cotton. When the Civil War was over the South found that their cotton wasn't worth as much as it used to be.</p>

<dd>Yes, of course the blockade was initially porous. However, note that you refer to "blockade runners" rather than "cargo ships," which implies that the blockade had an effect even early in the war. One of the problems the Confederacy had was that the blockade runners concentrated on high-dollar-value luxury items rather than arms for import or cotton for export. Early in the war, Jefferson Davis and the Confederate government deliberately withheld cotton exports, in the hope of compelling Great Britain to break the blockade. This turned out to be a grave strategic error because by the time they realized their strategy was not working, the Union blockade had tightened and such exports were impossible. There's a good discussion of cotton exports and the blockade in James McPherson's <i>Battle Cry of Freedom</i>. <a href="../../../h/l/j/User%7EHlj_9c70.html" title="User:Hlj">Hal Jespersen</a> 18:43, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If I asked for discussion before I made major changes to articles, my work would probably grind to a halt. Wikipedia doesn't do well at prepublication reviews of submissions. Jensen's mod was actually pretty good, focusing on the actual content of Scott's plan, rather than a larger discussion of overall Union strategy. <a href="../../../h/l/j/User%7EHlj_9c70.html" title="User:Hlj">Hal Jespersen</a> 18:08, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm currently taking AP US History and was taught that the 3rd part of the plan was to capture Richmond in the East, which was unsuccessful (until the end of the war) due to the skill of Lee and Jackson.</p>
<p>I realize this is contradictory but I'm just throwing it out there for review.</p>

<dd>Although Richmond was a key objective through most of the war, it was not part of Scott's letter to McClellan, and thus not part of what was derided by the press as the Anaconda Plan. <a href="../../../h/l/j/User%7EHlj_9c70.html" title="User:Hlj">Hal Jespersen</a> 02:49, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
