<p>I think whoever is posting the "anarchism is a part of socialism", and is related to Spain, blah blah, etc, and also based on the writtings of Tucker, Bakunin, etc, should stop.</p>
<p>Firstly, I don't think that all anarchists are into being included within the "socialist" movement, that's a very big assumption to make. Also, I also don't think that we should simply write anarchism off as simply a political/social/economic idea that is based around two historicial events, and 5 dead white guys.</p>

<p>Wrong. Libertarian Marxism is a form of libertarian socialism too, so to call libsoc a school of Anarchism is incorrect. As for Anarcho-communism and Individualist anarchism, they are *also* forms of libertarian socialism.

<dd>Anarchism is a form of libertarian socialism, as is autonomist marxism, council communism, etc... leave your anecdotal evidence aside and read the anarchist FAQ, where they state clearly that every form of anarchism is a form of socialism. Regardless though, implying that libertarian socialism is a <b>school</b> of anarchism means you must show me that it is a distinct faction, with a specific set of ideas that differentiate it from other factions within anarchism. Even if you don't agree that anarchism is a faction within it, then you would have to relegate it to related articles as opposed to schools of anarchism unless you can show that it is a specific faction within anarchism.--<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChe_y_Marijuana_56bf.html" title="User:Che y Marijuana">Che y Marijuana</a> 09:57, Mar 21, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would imagine that the number of anarchists who refer to themselves also as libertarian socialists would likely only be a portion of the anarchist movement/community, even if we <i>were</i> to come to the conclusion that anarchism proper is a form of libertarian socialism (which we haven't done and probably won't do). Perhaps "mainstream" anarchists would identify themselves as libertarian socialists, but I'd imagine a lot of anarchists don't want anything to do with partisan labels such as "libertarian". --<a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorvun_a92b.html" title="User:Corvun">Corvun</a> 18:01, Mar 21, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think it's important to understand that no matter what we believe in terms of whether or not anarchists are all libertarian socialists, in order to place it as a faction within anarchism, we need to show that it somehow is a seperate school with its own thinkers, organizations and historical differences. The reality is, there is no evidence to that. And the flagblackened.net site considers Daniel Guerrin, a Marxist, to be a libertarian socialist for example. As for the attacks on green anarchy and the post-left anarchy, they are infighting using big words. Green anarchy was infiltrated in the uk and overtaken by "national anarchists", going from a green anarchist and post-leftist scene to an out and out neo-nazi front. That's the history behind the attacks and accusations going back and forth. If you dig deeper, you'll find no one dismisses the ideologies themselves as non-anarchist, at least no one serious. Anyways, there's no evidence that libertarian socialism is <b>faction</b> within anarchism, though a few of you are attempting to prove that there is a crossover, none of the arguments support keeping it listed as a school. So I am removing it yet again.--<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChe_y_Marijuana_56bf.html" title="User:Che y Marijuana">Che y Marijuana</a> 03:35, Mar 24, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, i now tend to agree. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChe_y_Marijuana_56bf.html" title="User:Che y Marijuana">Che y Marijuana</a> is sort of right that <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarian_socialism.html" title="Libertarian socialism">it</a> is not trully just a school of <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">Anarchism</a>, i was just disagreeing with the classification of Anarchism as a part of the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialism.html" title="Socialism">socialist</a> movement.

<dd>The reason that anarchism is considered a part of the socialist movement is that by extension of the demands that all decisions be made using direct democracy, and control of society returned to people rather than the state or hierarchal structures, all forms of anarchism also demand that same democratic control for economics. Hence socialism, economics is not left to individual actors, but is social, controlled by the community. No matter what form it takes, that collective control remains. --<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChe_y_Marijuana_56bf.html" title="User:Che y Marijuana">Che y Marijuana</a> 11:14, Mar 24, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is unfortunate that Wikipedia is now copying the annoying methods of advertisers by introducing towers to its articles. Honestly, this "tower ad" for anarchism is taking up too much space on the articles it appears in and should be switched to being horizontal. It's especially bad when it appears in articles that are only related to anarchism (see <a href="../../../w/t/o/WTO_Meeting_of_1999_b4c3.html" title="WTO Meeting of 1999">WTO Meeting of 1999</a> for instance) and makes it seem like the article is about anarchists when they were only involved in the subject. Maybe this works for the articles that are about anarchism (I'm not complaining about info boxes that are directly related to the subject matter), but it is a detriment to anything outside of the subject that just happens to be related to it (such as the things found in the "Anarchism in history" section and the "Related Subjects" section of the template). This vertical template is just a form of POV forced on to an article the same way a tower ad is forced on to the viewer of a web site. We editors should be above using such tactics. -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 05:01, May 30, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Whether anarcho-capitalism constitutes anarchism is a question of POV, not fact. Anarcho-capitalist POV would state that anarcho-socialism is not true anarchism.

<p>One line is a minor edit, especially when concerning minor internet clubs being listed as the first school of anarchism in that list. You have been pandered to enough. Anarchism is the rejection of hierarchy. Boss/employee relationships are hierarchal. Hence, ancaps are not a form of anarchism. All the historical figures of anarchism are anti-capitalist. The entire historical movement of anarchism is anti-capitalist. It would be improper for wikipedia to revise history and political reality to serve your needs. If ancaps are in the list, so too will the neo-nazis calling themselves "National Anarchists" be.

Anarchism is, has been, and always will be anti-capitalist, anarchism is against hierarchy with NO exception, PERIOD!

<dd>The fact that you can not discuss this topic rationally without resorting to expletives indicates to me that you are probably too POV to be changing it. The word anarchism only means "without government". That is what the root words means - and anarcho-capitalists surely fall into the category of those who oppose government. Capitalism as a form of hierarchy is debatable, and you may participate in that debate, but it is not advisable in a Wikipedia entry. The fact is that there have been capitalists in the anarchist movement throughout its history - they have merely been a minor presence. To exclude them merely because they are minor, but include people like the primitivists (who are at least as minor, if not moreso), is blatantly POV. --<a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcademician_5003.html" title="User:Academician">Academician</a> 01:40, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No government easily rules out anarcho-capitalists, who support many governing institutions like a judiciary, police, and even debtors prisons. But the definition goes beyond no government, many definitions indicate that anarchism rejects authority itself, which is far more accurate with both its etymology and its history, and the very root meaning of the word makes clear that it goes beyond the mere statism that anarcho-capitalists reject, because a ruler can be anyone who uses authority to dominate another. That could be a prince using his army, a baron using a militia, a CEO using his security forces, or a land-lord using his hired thugs. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 01:15, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>This is totally backwards - Some anarcho-capitalists are members of the Libertarian Party, but very few members of the Libertarian Party are anarcho-capitalists. Minarchism and anarcho-capitalism are both related to the libertarian political philosophy - but minarchists are definitely NOT anarcho-capitalists, since they believe in government. Anarcho-capitalists <i>by definition</i> are against the state - that is why they use the prefix "anarcho-", and there is not a single example you can give me of a real anarcho-capitalist who believes in the State.. Also, the LP certainly did not campaign for Ronald Reagan - they had their own candidates in <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._presidential_election%2C_1980_c07b.html" title="U.S. presidential election, 1980">1980</a> and <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._presidential_election%2C_1984_cb9f.html" title="U.S. presidential election, 1984">1984</a>.

<li>95% of Christians say that Mormons are not Christian, but does that mean that the Mormons should be totally excluded from the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> article? After all, Mormons themselves DO believe they are Christians, and follow a good deal of the Christian tradition - even though they depart with Christianity, even on some very key principles. Anarcho-capitalism is similar - it shares a great deal in common with traditional anarchists in general, but does depart with them on some key principles. That is not grounds for their exclusion - but I do agree that caveats are in order on the articles themselves. These caveats are present, therefore there should be no problem. I also do not see why National Socialism should be kept out of <a href="../../../s/o/c/Template%7ESocialism_b4cc.html" title="Template:Socialism">Template:Socialism</a> - since, after all, they were a Socialist movement, and the contoversy IS discussed on <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialism.html" title="Socialism">Socialism</a>.

<p>I see thet you have the same problem as we have in Poland. There are around 10 "anarcho-"capitalists involved in UPR party (this is not even minarchist party, but radical conservative-liberal party). they do nothing in real life, except attacking anarchists on the internet. It's not enough when you're against government to be an anarchist. This is obvious. AFAIK in Somalia now we have no real functioning government, so can we say that this is "anarchist country"? I can even say that this is almost capitalist paradise, because no government controls market there. But there are still bosses with lot of money that control market (and from the economic point of view, player on the market who has more capital have appriopriate influence on market). So we have there capitalist paradise without government, and with bosses on the top and slaves below. Capitalist is a form of wielding power by those who have more capital, so can we call this anarchist? And another question: is it enough to call yourself anarchist to be considered as anarchist? AFAIK i know in poland one idiot who calls himself an anarcho-rasist. Is it enough to put this into "schools of anarchism"?

<p>Whether "anarcho-"capitalism constitutes anarchism is a not question of POV, but a question of facts.

<dd>Note that a dictionary definition is hardly an adequate way to explain a complex philosophical topic. Note also that that is not even a very common definition of anarchism. Also, words do not always mean the same thing as their elementary parts. Even if they did, "arkhos" is better translated as "ruler" than "state", and capitalism to any traditional form of anarchism serves as that dominator. I find it ironic you consider my actions POV, and then proceed to put a supposed school of anarchism that has generated, as you say yourself, a full 20 pages of controversy, at the very top of the list.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">proposal to eliminate all subtypes of anarchism from the template</span></h2>
<p>I would like to suggest that the template simply omit the list of varieties of anarchism. Lots of intelligent people seem to have wasted an immense amount of time on edit wars about this. The plain truth is that based on google hits, essentially <i>none</i> of the flavors on the list is particularly important. I think the list is misleading, because it implies to the naive reader that anarchism lacks any coherence at all, whereas actually I think there is a very clear mainstream of anarchist thought. The template is prominently placed, and therefore should only be used for really useful stuff that many readers will want to know about. It doesn't really matter that some of these flavors, like "Christian anarchism," do have more adherents than could meet in a VW bug; they're still pitifully insignificant when seen against the backdrop of anarchism in general. They deserve their own articles, but they don't deserve special, prominent listing in this template. And just to lay my cards on the table, I'm not an anarchist myself, I'm a libertarian, and my primary focus on WP is historical stuff regarding racism in the U.S.--<a href="../../../b/c/r/User%7EBcrowell_f3ce.html" title="User:Bcrowell">Bcrowell</a> 22:48, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Is "approaches" a better description? It seems to me that anarchists all have a fairly similar concept of utopia, and calling them schools makes them sound somewhat distant from one another. In actuality they often work in collaboration with one another, just utilizing different "approaches" in reaching the reasonably coherent final aim of egalitarian society, if that makes sense. Or maybe "focuses", since some people find some issues (i.e. environment, gender equality) more important than others? <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 23:27, July 27, 2005 (UTC)

I think these unimportant schools of thought on the fringe of anarchism don't belong in a prominently placed template. Including them in it has led to a series of silly and time-consuming edit wars. To me, the issue isn't whether to call them "schools" or "approaches" or "focuses," the issue is that they're simply not that important, and shouldn't be promoted in way that's out of proportion to their importance. I've met a lot of anarchists, and none of them believed in Christianity, racism, or capitalism. The google hits for all of these flavors are extremely low. IMO, they're notable enough to have articles, but that's it. I also think the anarchism article's text itself devotes way too much space to a discussion of obscure flavors of anarchism, which is misleading to the reader; maybe these should all be spun off into an article with a title like Alternative models of anarchism.--<a href="../../../b/c/r/User%7EBcrowell_f3ce.html" title="User:Bcrowell">Bcrowell</a> 16:08, 28 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Of course those aren't related. They're working largely in opposition to the broader anarchist movement, whereas most of these focuses simply highlight one form of inequality and attempt to counter it. Those that want the state reduced but wish to retain some conservative principle (such as capitalism, nationalism, Christianity, etc) are not focusing on a domination but simply <i>allowing an exception</i>. To coninue Beta's metaphor, you might call those other forms rashes or tumors. Black anarchism I would disagree on, since although a misnomer it is interested in restoring "racial" equality. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 22:48, July 28, 2005 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Schools of Thought Reinstatement</span></h2>
<p>I don't know what to think about this. I realise the concern with perhaps the idea that anarchism has a "lack of coherence," but Wikipedia is not an exercise in trying to portray Anarchism in the best possible light. I am an eclectic anarchist, as I describe myself, and I believe you have hindered the function of the template by removing the schools. How are they not relevant? I myself, although rejecting anarcho-capitalism as a farce and not a form of anarchism, realise that it is valid to link to it as well. Why do us Anarchist Wikipedians get our personal feelings in the way of NPOV? If you want to talk about all subjects relating to anarchism, people claiming they are anarchists is an issue that is related and most certainly deserves to be in the template. I propose reinstatement of the 'schools of thought,' perhaps with a more PC separation of AC from the list into another section "controversial anarchism? white national anarchism could be included). It is a shame that being "PC" even has to be proposed for anarchists to be sane about their edits.</p>
<p>The template is supposed to be <b>useful</b>. I want to be able to click on anarcho-communism, anarcha-feminism, etc. They're not irrelevant by any means. And if you're removing schools of thought, why is crypto-anarchism kept? This is all very confusing and unnecessary. Once again, I believe for the sake of pragmaticism, we should reinstate the schools of thought. <a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELockeownzj00_ffbe.html" title="User:Lockeownzj00">Lockeownzj00</a> 18:31, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

Also the argument isn't that it isn't a "form" of anarchism, it's that it's grossly overrepresented as a "form", and a "form" by a definition completely incompatible with most other anarchist philosophies. In turn it's a definition then forced onto everything else so as to merit its own inclusion. Anarcho-capitalism is obviously huge, but it's hardly huge <i>within the context of anarchism</i>. I think you'd have difficulty locating an anarcho-capitalist who identified primarily as an anarchist. Almost all centrally consider themselves libertarian, and insisting that it be represented with regard to its own individual base of support rather than its contextual base is grossly biased. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 08:12, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I remain opposed, because I dislike the term "schools of thought", which is fairly conceived and anyway inaccurate with regard to most of them, which as I stated earlier might better be regarded as "focuses" or "approaches", or even just simply "philosophies". A number of them aren't complete philosophies and can work in conjunction with other forms (e.g. anarcha-feminism, christian anarchism, green anarchism, spiritual anarchism), so the term "school" seems inappropriate and anyway inaccurate. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 08:12, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I <b>oppose</b> usage of "Schools of Thought" How about "Anarchist Labels" or "Categories" or even "Memetic Sub-species"? A school implies an institution, as if anarchism is taught in any discernably codified fashion, pertaining to a particular branch of dogma, of which anarchism holds none.

<dd>Our ideals are not incompatible. If it's a (very understandable) issue of semantics, we can change it: although I think there was no malicious intent of the use of the phrase "school of thought" nor do I think it is as biased as is being said, I still understand the points being made. The linsk to the articles are the core issue here: what we call them is also importnat, but I agree, a more accurate label might be appropriate.</dd>

<dd>If we, then, changed the label but with the same sort of links, would you (those opposing) still be opposed? I still maintain that the template is handicapped by just removing all those subjects. However, this is supposed to be an <b>encyclopedia</b>--pragmatic, not anal retentive. "Memtic sub-species," I think, despite being accurate, is too far for obvious reasons. It is obvious, too, I think, that there shouldnt be any kind of dogma: but the problem is people interpreting something as dogmatic when it's just a point of reference. These categories are not to be noted as law, and in fact, I believe the articles themselves consistently have a disclaimer saying that there is no one form of anarchism, and that there are many organic forms of anarchist theory. Categorising anything is dangerous, but I think it's still valid: for example, with music, I think it has come too far in some cases, where people die for their genre and stick (conservatively, I might add) to these imaginary 'roots' that they fabricate. However, referring to something as post-punk as a simple point of reference (as opposed to being belligerent when someone defines certain thing as post-punk) is not bad, in my opinion. These are just points of reference.</dd>

<dd>Heh, I was joking with the "memetic sub-species", How about <b>anarchist strategies</b>?

<dd>Yeah, I like that one best I think. It's just the idea of divisiveness I'm against, because there's a lot of overlap between most of the models which seems inappropriate. But maybe this doesn't apply quite so well to post-anarchism, since it doesn't really have a distinct strategy? Not that I'm sure it's large enough yet to warrant being here (Newman coined the term only in 2001), but just so we know we have a term that could fit everything. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 17:18, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>1) Articles that incorporate the 'Libertarianism' template and not the anarchism template have no place on this template. Assumedly, every article on here should refer back to the template. There's point on including articles that don't. Another example. Autonomist marxism references communism and not anarchism, at all. It shouldn't be listed as an anarchist school, and it isn't anywhere but here. I moved it to the "see also" section.</p>
<p>2) I've removed links to stubs that have no information on them and are dubious already. Maybe include later.</p>
<p>3) Some of the 'schools' listed are not schools but tactics.</p>
<p>4) Half of the things in anarchism and culture have nothing to do with culture. I've split the sections --<a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFluteyFlakes88_3174.html" title="User:FluteyFlakes88">FluteyFlakes88</a> 00:56, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm goal with my recent set of edits is to tighten up the template, maybe reduce its size, and include a section on history. One idea is to create a meta-list for anarchist lists so we only have to include one link to it on here. I'm moving around some of the schools that aren't really schools at all but a theoretical point (post-leftism). Some questions we should discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is anarcha-feminism a school or just a theoretical point. IE, does it have any exclutsive ideology attached to it or is it something incorporated by all other schools listed?</li>
<li>Should Social Ecology be listed?</li>

<dd>I don't like the term "school" at all, but anarcha-feminism probably isn't a "complete" anarchist theory (though it might be a complete feminist theory) because it generally leans on anarchist communism et al for a number of points, (even as it remains critical of them). But still, most of these "schools" are hardly all that independent. Christian anarchism is making a similar point (that anarchism is a necessary component of Christianity), as is post-anarchism (which is more-or-less a post-stucturalist revision of anarchist communism). Green anarchism is another blanket term, often tied to others, making its own point. <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_anarchism.html" title="Black anarchism">Black anarchism</a> (or <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchist_people_of_color.html" title="Anarchist people of color">anarchist people of color</a>) (not listed here) also makes a similar statement. Libertarian socialist is a very broad term, and probably shouldn't be listed as a school or anything else. Individualist anarchism is again very broad. I'm not sure how the Situationists relate to anarchism exactly, or whether they should be included here at all. To put it short, I'm pretty uncomfortable with the list in general. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 07:43, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Crimethinc is actually the antithesis of a "school" since they disavow all ideology, labels, and artificial culture. You can call that pretense, bcrimethinc publications often contradict one another, sometimes on purpose, sometimes not.

Different collectives and individuals under the crimethinc banner have different ideas. The whole point behind post-left sort of thought, crimethinc or not, is to move away from ideology and embrace questioning, contradiction, and self-analysis. --<a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETothebarricades.tk_2bb0.html" title="User:Tothebarricades.tk">Tothebarricades</a> 10:07, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The template has been blocked by an administrator, per my request, due to a revert war initiated by <a href="../../../h/o/g/User_talk%7EHogeye_bb15.html" title="User talk:Hogeye">Hogeye (talk)</a>.

<dd>The issue has been resolved. Collective decision multiple time on this page have agreed that Hogeye's edits are simple POV trolling. We've already discussed this. Blocking the template only prevents us honest participants from working on it. Hogeye has already been blocked here twice before for trolling against a collective agreement. I say just block him for good. --<a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFluteyFlakes88_3174.html" title="User:FluteyFlakes88">FluteyFlakes88</a> 21:15, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please feel free to voice your concerns to Voice of All, the user who blocked the page. Hogeye is indeed very disruptive. The rare occasions during which he actually engages in discussion, he usually only incites flame wars. I've voiced my concerns on his user talk page, but he keeps erasing them. By all means, complain to an administrator. --AaronS 22:11, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>He didn't list the protection because putting a protected message on the template would make it occur in all articles with the template.

Furthermore, I propose that we request a block/ban of some months time on user:Hogeye, seeing as his last month ban taught him nothing and he is still as anti-social as ever.

<p>Ok, people. Let's talk it out and stop the revert wars.

<dd>Judging by google hits it's much less notable than many forms of anarchism not listed here already, such as post-anarchism, utopian anarchism, insurrectionism, or even spiritual anarchism. In short, even if it is connected to anarchism in some secret or spurious way it just isn't nearly of enough note for inclusion here. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 09:46, 4 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Geoism is more popular than you think (as if popularity is a good criteria.) The anarchism of Georgism is intermingled with the minarchism, so it's hard to get a good google reading. Try googling "geoism" (17900) or Georgism (17200). It's kind of like what would have happened if Rothbard hadn't popularized the term "anarcho-capitalism" - you still would have had a bunch of them, but they would all be calling themselves "libertarian" and be hard to find in the mass of minarchist libertarians.</dd>

<dd>I vote strongly to NOT link the picture. As Jobjörn mentioned, none of the other templates have such image links; and not just templates, the entire encyclopedia. There's no precedent for introducing this kind of inconsistency. I wanted to find the image that was used, and it required: viewing the source of the article to see what template was included, going to the template page, and looking through the template source to find the image tag. This should not be necessary. The wiki software is designed so that every image links to its image page; respect that, don't find ugly hacks to work around it. ~&#160;<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBooyabazooka_79a9.html" title="User:Booyabazooka">Booya <sup>Bazooka</sup></a> 18:16, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I shrunk down the image because it doesn't really add much to the template's value. The icon is very simple, and all necessary detail is shown clearly in the smaller version.

<dl>
<dd>Right, to say it's disputed, or to say it's not disputed, are both POV. The place for such disputation is in the articles, not on a template. The only non-POV way to handle it that I can see is to either include ancap alphabetically, or to make two lists of traditions/schools - one specifying anti-statist only, the other anti-statist plus anti-capitalist. <a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.219.253.189.html" title="User:216.219.253.189">216.219.253.189</a>

<dl>
<dd>Including it alphabetically is blatantly POV, because there's numerous non-anarchist academic sources that say things such as "The term 'anarcho-capitalism' for this domain of right wing libertarianism is generally regarded as a political oxymoron by anarchists" (<i>Anarchism</i> by Sean M. Sheehan, 2004). Not including it is also blatantly POV, because many anarcho-capitalists claim to be anarchist. The separation Hogeye suggests makes no sense, because anarcho-capitalists are the only group opposed to the state that don't oppose capitalism, and not only are they not against it, they embrace it with open arms. The most neutral approach is to list it, but marginalize it. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 01:28, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>Late to the party, but the "disputed" still looks reaaaaaaaaaaly silly. I would definitely advocate the tag's removal. I am neither an anarchist nor an anarcho-capitalist, and it seems to me that the "standard" anarchists are confusing a legitimate disagreement with anarcho-capitalism with "and therefore it must not be anarchism." This can easily be dealt with by mentioning disagreements between "standard" anarchists and anarcho-capitalists- which it seems has already been done by the article <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_and_anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism">Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism</a>.</p>
<p>To put it another way- the <a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/anarchism" class="external text" title="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/anarchism" rel="nofollow">Merriam-Webster definition of anarchism</a> is: <i>a political theory holding all forms of governmental authority to be unnecessary and undesirable and advocating a society based on voluntary cooperation and free association of individuals and groups.</i> If anarcho-capitalists really do advocate abolishing the government, that means they're anarchists, even if you disagree with them. Perhaps the best comparison might be religious debates; there are <i>lots</i> of Sunnis who think that Shias aren't "true" Muslims, and the reverse is true for zealots on the Shia side. Hardcore parts of <i>both</i> sides detest Sufis. Nevertheless, a neutral source should list <i>all</i> of them under an Islam list, and simply note the disageements within the article. There are all sorts of fringe Christian groups that cause mainstream Christians to wince; I don't see why anarchists should be able to exclude fellow anarchists just because they don't like them. If, god forbid, a large school of anarchist thought arose that believed in abolishing the government so that it would be easier to beat other anarchists over the head with baseball bats, then they should be included on the list too, even though other anarchists disagree with them. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowFire_df7e.html" title="User:SnowFire">SnowFire</a> 03:03, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Bad analogy, it isn't just <i>hardcore</i> parts, its <i>all</i> non-anarcho-capitalist parts think this way (with few exceptions to the rule). It really is disputed, just read a few books on anarchism. - <a href="../../../f/-/m/User%7EF-m-t_02fb.html" title="User:F-m-t">FrancisTyers</a> <a href="../../../f/-/m/User_talk%7EF-m-t_cc17.html" title="User talk:F-m-t">·</a> 09:39, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, but that's not relevant to what I'm saying. Perhaps I should have used something stronger; take <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Phelps_24e6.html" title="Fred Phelps">Fred Phelps</a> instead, then. <i>Nobody</i> in the Christian community likes him (with few exceptions), including other fundamentalists and "conservatives." Heck, some of them have been loudest in calling him actually a Satanist in disguise. His theology only bears a vague resemblance to any other form of Christianity, with about the only similarity being the same holy books and the same "Jesus is God" thing. Nevertheless, the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Category%7EWestboro_Baptist_Church_eaf3.html" title="Category:Westboro Baptist Church">Category:Westboro Baptist Church</a> he's in is under Christian fundamentalism, which I feel is correct. Gnostic Christianity, which is somewhat in vogue to look at now, bears very little resemblance to modern Christianity, with utterly different systems of morals and thoughts on what Christ was. For examples with more adherents, the Mormons and the Jehovah's Witnesses have some practices that are very... odd, to mainstream Christianity. Nevertheless, they can and should be referenced when talking about Christian groups, because they're "close enough..." even as the Christian groups themselves say that Fred Phelps or whoever is being <i>unchristian,</i> perhaps correctly. I use the religious analogy because it's even more of a firestarter, and has been discussed in detail in other places.</dd>

<dd>My point is that while mainstream anarchists might (even universally) dislike anarcho-capitalists, it doesn't mean that they aren't anarchists, just that in the view of most that they're very bad at being anarchists and are undercutting their own anarchism. Again: the mainstream view of anarchism is "no, or at least very little, government." Do the anarcho-capitalists believe in this? My understanding is that they do. That's it, even if anarchists believe that other anarcho-capitalist beliefs are inconsistent with anarchism. It's no different from "Yes, we believe in Jesus too, but we come up with totally different conclusions as to what that means." <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowFire_df7e.html" title="User:SnowFire">SnowFire</a> 04:55, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The church analogy would be good if we could take just one church and say "all the other churches say this isn't a real church", but they all agree that they are "real churches", but the fact is that churches all refute each other to a certain degree. Its not that they believe the same stuff, they believe the opposite, they are pro-usury, pro-rent, pro-police, pro-all-the-things-that-other-anarchists-are-against, that they are against the state is rather secondary to these points. They can be called anarchists in some narrow dictionary definitions of the word only, and this encyclopaedia is not built on such. <i>Meaning</i> does not come from dictionaries. - <a href="../../../f/-/m/User%7EF-m-t_02fb.html" title="User:F-m-t">FrancisTyers</a> <a href="../../../f/-/m/User_talk%7EF-m-t_cc17.html" title="User talk:F-m-t">·</a> 07:29, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmm, we may have to agree to disagree. The dictionary was just a reference; my claim was that it is the popular usage of anarchism, and meaning <i>does</i> come from people. Moreover, the anarcho-capitalists themselves seem to say it, and you have to give the intent of the person/group claiming some belief weight. (In the United States) There are some Republicans who sure <i>claim</i> to be conservatives, and then act against conservatism whenever given the chance. The same is true of the Democrats and liberalism/progressivism. I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and say that they're just being really bad conservatives by stuffing the budget with pork and so on, at least in an encyclopedic context where it would be very bad form to add "and Sen. Smith proved his true nature when he abandoned fiscal conservatism to enrich his corporate buddies." If anarcho-capitalists wish to be associated with anarchism, let them, but then factually mention in the articles all the things that don't jibe (Sen. Smith claims to be a strong conservative. In the most recent budget bill, he succeeded in adding a rider that built a 300-foot tall statue of himself in his original district while a Representative...), mention the dispute, and trust readers to come to their own conclusions.</dd>

<dd>Just so it's clear, I would have no problem with removing anarcho-capitalism completely, or reorganizing the template to make it clear that it's its own branch; I don't think that's correct, but it would satisfy the main stylistic complaint about the "(disputed)" looking very silly. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowFire_df7e.html" title="User:SnowFire">SnowFire</a> 13:50, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, between those two I vote remove. The best option is still labelling it as disputed though. That seems like the most neutral way of going about it, since including it and not including it both make a judgement one way or the other. As for the church thing, there are differences in many idea, but they agree on the central point of Jesus being important if not divine. You say that since an-caps reject government, they share the same central point as real (IMO) anarchists, but as far as I'm concerned, this shows a lack of understanding of what anarchism is about. The popular meaning for the average Joe might be no government, but anarchism always has and still does claim as it's central tennet opposition to <b>all authority</b>, which is almost always taken to include capitalism. To then just say that a group of capitalists can call themselves anarchists and not even have it mentioned that it's disputed is ridiculous. That would be like a christian who said they didn't give a damn about Jesus. Another example is national socialism (sic), which most people agree is <i>not</i> a form of socialism. Just because they call themselves socialists doesn't mean they are. Any assertation that they belong within their respective group should at least be mentioned as disputed. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force">The Ungovernable Force</a> 05:20, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
