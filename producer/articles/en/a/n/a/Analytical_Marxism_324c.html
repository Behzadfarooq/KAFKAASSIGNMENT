<p>Analytical Marxism is usually understood to have taken off with the publication of G. A. Cohen's <i>Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence</i> (1978). More broadly conceived, it might be seen as having originated in the post-war period in the work of political philosophers such as <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Popper_510f.html" title="Karl Popper">Karl Popper</a>, <a href="../../../h/2E/_/H._B._Acton_6b01.html" title="H. B. Acton">H. B. Acton</a>, and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Plamenatz_3e09.html" title="John Plamenatz">John Plamenatz</a>, who employed the techniques of <a href="../../../a/n/a/Analytical_philosophy.html" title="Analytical philosophy">analytical philosophy</a> in order to test the coherence and scientificity of Marxism as a theory of history and society.</p>
<p>Those thinkers were all hostile to Marxism. Cohen's book was, from the outset, intended as a defence of <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_materialism.html" title="Historical materialism">historical materialism</a>. Cohen painstakingly reconstructed historical materialism through a close reading of Marx's texts, with the aim of providing the most logically coherent and parsimonious account. For Cohen, Marx's historical materialism is a <a href="../../../t/e/c/Technological_determinism.html" title="Technological determinism">technologically deterministic</a> theory, in which the economic <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relations_of_production.html" title="Relations of production">relations of production</a> are functionally explained by the material <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forces_of_production.html" title="Forces of production">forces of production</a>, and in which the political and legal institutions (the "superstructure") are functionally explained by the relations of production (the "base"). The transition from one <a href="../../../m/o/d/Mode_of_production.html" title="Mode of production">mode of production</a> to another is driven by the tendency of the productive forces to develop. Cohen accounts for this tendency by reference to the rational character of the human species: where there is the opportunity to adopt a more productive technology and thus reduce the burden of labour, human beings will tend to take it. Thus, human history can be understood as the gradual development of human productive power.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/a/Analytical_Marxism_324c.html" title="Edit section: Exploitation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Exploitation</span></h2>
<p>At the same time as Cohen was working on <i>Karl Marx's Theory of History</i>, American economist John Roemer was employing neoclassical economics in order to try to defend the Marxist concepts of <a href="../../../e/x/p/Exploitation.html" title="Exploitation">exploitation</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_class.html" title="Social class">class</a>. In his <i>General Theory of Exploitation and Class</i> (1982), Roemer employed <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rational_choice.html" title="Rational choice">rational choice</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_theory.html" title="Game theory">game theory</a> in order to demonstrate how exploitation and class relations may arise in the development of a market for labour. Roemer would go on to reject the idea that the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_theory_of_value.html" title="Labour theory of value">labour theory of value</a> was necessary for explaining exploitation and class. Value was in principle capable of being explained in terms of any class of commodity inputs, such as oil, wheat, etc., rather than being exclusively explained by embodied labour power. Roemer was led to the conclusion that exploitation and class were thus generated not in the sphere of production but of market exchange. Significantly, as a purely technical category, exploitation did not always imply a moral wrong (see section <a href="#Justice" title="">Justice</a> below).</p>

<p>By the mid-1980s, "analytical Marxism" was being recognised as a "<a href="../../../p/a/r/Paradigm.html" title="Paradigm">paradigm</a>".<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Roemer"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/n/a/Analytical_Marxism_324c.html#endnote_Roemer" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/n/a/Analytical_Marxism_324c.html#endnote_Roemer" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></sup></span> The September group had been meeting for several years, and a succession of texts by its members were published. Several of these appeared under the imprint of Cambridge University Press's series "Studies in Marxism and Social Theory", including Jon Elster's <i>Making Sense of Marx</i> (1985) and Adam Przeworski's <i>Capitalism and Social Democracy</i> (1986). Elster's account was an exhaustive trawl through Marx's texts in order to ascertain what could be salvaged out of Marxism employing the tools of rational choice theory and <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodological_individualism.html" title="Methodological individualism">methodological individualism</a> (which Elster defended as the only form of explanation appropriate to the social sciences). His conclusion was that – contra Cohen – no general theory of history as the development of the productive forces could be saved. Like Roemer, he also rejected the labour theory of value and, going further, virtually all of Marx's economics. The "dialectical" method is savaged as a form of <a href="../../../g/2E/w/G.W.F._Hegel_b8c0.html" title="G.W.F. Hegel">Hegelian</a> <a href="../../../o/b/s/Obscurantism.html" title="Obscurantism">obscurantism</a>. The theory of ideology and revolution continued to be useful to a certain degree, but only once they had been purged of their tendencies to <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holism.html" title="Holism">holism</a> and <a href="../../../f/u/n/Functionalism.html" title="Functionalism">functionalism</a> and established on the basis of an individualist methodology and a causal or intentional explanation.</p>
<p>Przeworski's book uses rational choice and game theory in order to demonstrate that the <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolutionary_socialism.html" title="Revolutionary socialism">revolutionary</a> strategies adopted by socialists in the twentieth century were likely to fail, since it was in the rational interests of workers to strive for the reform of capitalism through the achievement of <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labor_union.html" title="Labor union">union</a> recognition, improved wages and living conditions, rather than adopting the risky strategy of revolution. Przeworski's book is clearly influenced by economic explanations of political behaviour advanced by thinkers such as <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Downs_1f43.html" title="Anthony Downs">Anthony Downs</a> (<i>An Economic Theory of Democracy, 1957</i>) and <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mancur_Olson_6140.html" title="Mancur Olson">Mancur Olson</a> (<i>The Logic of Collective Action</i>, 1971).</p>

<p>The analytical (and rational choice) Marxists held a variety of leftist political sympathies, ranging from <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">communism</a> to reformist <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_democracy.html" title="Social democracy">social democracy</a>. Through the 1980s, most of them began to recognise that Marxism as a theory capable of explaining revolution in terms of the economic dynamics of capitalism and the class interests of the proletariat had been seriously compromised. They were largely in agreement that the transformation of capitalism was an ethical project. During the 1980s, a debate had developed within Anglophone academic Marxism on whether Marxism could accommodate a theory of justice. This debate was clearly linked to the revival of normative political philosophy after the publication of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Rawls_1c87.html" title="John Rawls">John Rawls</a>'s <i><a href="../../../a/_/t/A_Theory_of_Justice_701b.html" title="A Theory of Justice">A Theory of Justice</a></i> (1971). While analytic <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moral_philosophy.html" title="Moral philosophy">moral philosophy</a> holds that one is free in all situations to make a moral judgement that is in the interests of all equally, some commentators remained hostile to the idea of a Marxist theory of justice, arguing that Marx saw "justice" as little more than a bourgeois ideological construct designed to justify exploitation by reference to reciprocity in the wage contract.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Wood"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/n/a/Analytical_Marxism_324c.html#endnote_Wood" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/n/a/Analytical_Marxism_324c.html#endnote_Wood" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></sup></span> The analytical Marxists, however, largely rejected this point of view. Led by G. A. Cohen (a moral philosopher by training), they argued that a Marxist theory of justice had to focus on <a href="../../../e/g/a/Egalitarianism.html" title="Egalitarianism">egalitarianism</a>. For Cohen, this meant an engagement with moral and political philosophy in order to demonstrate the injustice of market exchange, and the construction of an appropriate egalitarian metric. This argument is pursued in Cohen's most recent books, <i>Self-Ownership, Freedom and Equality</i> (1995) and <i>If You're an Egalitarian How Come You're So Rich?</i> (2000b).</p>
<p>In contrast to traditional Marxism, Cohen rejects the argument that <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalism.html" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a> is unjust because under it workers experience <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marx%27s_theory_of_alienation.html" title="Marx's theory of alienation">alienation</a>, or a lack of self-fulfilment as workers. For Cohen, this thesis is based on an untenable <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metaphysics.html" title="Metaphysics">metaphysical</a> account of <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_nature.html" title="Human nature">human nature</a> and historical development: the claim that all persons have one purpose and aim toward one end, productive labour. Because such a claim cannot be inferred from <a href="../../../a/_/p/A_priori.html" title="A priori">a priori</a> truths of <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logic.html" title="Logic">logic</a> or from experience, it is not justifiable by the restricted means available to analytic philosophy.</p>
<p>Cohen further departs from previous Marxists by arguing that capitalism is a system characterised by unjust <a href="../../../e/x/p/Exploitation.html" title="Exploitation">exploitation</a> not because the labour of workers is "stolen" by employers, but because it is a system wherein "<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/autonomy" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:autonomy">autonomy</a>" is infringed and which results in a distribution of benefits and burdens that is "unfair". In the traditional account, exploitation and injustice occur because non-workers appropriate the value produced by the labour of workers, something that would be overcome in a <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist.html" title="Socialist">socialist</a> society wherein no class would own the <a href="../../../m/e/a/Means_of_production.html" title="Means of production">means of production</a> and be in a position to appropriate the value produced by labourers. Cohen argues that underpinning this account is the assumption that workers have "rights of <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-ownership.html" title="Self-ownership">self-ownership</a>" over themselves and thus, should "own" what is produced by their labour. Because the worker is paid a wage less than the value he or she creates through work, the capitalist is said to extract a <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surplus-value.html" title="Surplus-value">surplus-value</a> from the worker's labour, and thus to steal part of what the worker produces, the time of the worker and the worker's powers.</p>
<p>Cohen argues that the concept of self-ownership is favourable to Rawls's difference principle as it ensures "each person's rights over his being and powers"<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Cohen2"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/n/a/Analytical_Marxism_324c.html#endnote_Cohen2" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/n/a/Analytical_Marxism_324c.html#endnote_Cohen2" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></sup></span> - i.e. that one is treated as an end always and never as a means - but also highlights that its centrality provides for an area of common ground between the Marxist account of justice and the <a href="../../../r/i/g/Right-wing.html" title="Right-wing">right-wing</a> <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarianism.html" title="Libertarianism">libertarianism</a> of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Nozick_b761.html" title="Robert Nozick">Robert Nozick</a>. However, much as Cohen criticises Rawls for treating people's personal powers as just another external resource for which no individual can claim merit, so does he charge Nozick with moving beyond the <i>concept</i> of self-ownership to his own right-wing "thesis" of self-ownership. In Cohen's view, Nozick's mistake is to endow people's claims to legitimately acquire external resources with the same moral quality that belongs to people's ownership of themselves. In other words, libertarianism allows inequalities to arise from differences in talent and differences in external resources, but it does so because it assumes that the world is "up for grabs"<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Cohen3"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/n/a/Analytical_Marxism_324c.html#endnote_Cohen3" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/n/a/Analytical_Marxism_324c.html#endnote_Cohen3" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></sup></span>, i.e. to be appropriated as private property.</p>

<p>A number of critics argued that analytical Marxism proceeded from the wrong methodological and epistemological premises. While the analytical Marxists dismissed dialectically oriented Marxism as "bullshit", many Marxists would maintain that the distinctive character of Marxist philosophy is lost if it is understood non-dialectically. The crucial feature of Marxist philosophy is that it is not a reflection in thought of the world, a crude materialism, but rather an intervention in the world concerned with human <a href="../../../p/r/a/Praxis.html" title="Praxis">praxis</a>. According to this view, analytical Marxism wrongly characterises intellectual activity as occurring in isolation from the struggles constitutive of its social and political conjuncture, and at the same time does little to intervene in that conjuncture. For dialectical Marxists, analytical Marxism eviscerated Marxism, turning it from a systematic doctrine of revolutionary transformation into a set of discrete theses that stand or fall on the basis of their logical consistency and empirical validity.</p>
<p>Analytical Marxism's non-Marxist critics also objected to its methodological weaknesses. Against Elster and the rational choice Marxists, it was argued that methodological individualism was not the only form of valid explanation in the social sciences, that functionalism in the absence of micro-foundations could remain a convincing and fruitful mode of inquiry, and that rational choice and game theory were far from being universally accepted as sound or useful ways of modelling social institutions and processes.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Carver"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/n/a/Analytical_Marxism_324c.html#endnote_Carver" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/n/a/Analytical_Marxism_324c.html#endnote_Carver" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></sup></span></p>

<p>Cohen's defence of a technological determinist interpretation of historical materialism was, in turn, quite widely criticised, even by analytical Marxists. Together with Andrew Levine, Wright argued that in attributing primacy to the productive forces (the development thesis), Cohen overlooked the role played by class actors in the transition between modes of production. For the authors, it was forms of class relations (the relations of production) that had primacy in terms of how the productive forces were employed and the extent to which they developed. It was not evident, they claimed, that the relations of production become "fetters" once the productive forces are capable of sustaining a different set of production relations.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Levine"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/n/a/Analytical_Marxism_324c.html#endnote_Levine" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/n/a/Analytical_Marxism_324c.html#endnote_Levine" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></sup></span> Other non-Marxist critics argued that Cohen, in line with the Marxist tradition, underestimated the role played by the legal and political superstructure in shaping the character of the economic base. Finally, Cohen's anthropology was judged dubious: whether human beings adopt new and more productive technology is not a function of an ahistorical rationality, but depends on the extent to which these forms of technology are compatible with pre-existing beliefs and social practices.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Hirst"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/n/a/Analytical_Marxism_324c.html#endnote_Hirst" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/n/a/Analytical_Marxism_324c.html#endnote_Hirst" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></sup></span> Cohen recognised and accepted some, though not all, of these criticisms in his <i>History, Labour, and Freedom</i> (1988).</p>

<p>Many Marxists would argue that Marxism cannot be understood as a theory of justice in the rather narrow sense intended by the analytical Marxists. The question of justice cannot be seen in isolation from questions of power, or from the balance of class forces in any specific conjuncture. Non-Marxists may employ a similar criticism in their critique of liberal theories of justice in the Rawlsian tradition. Most of these theories fail to address problems about the configuration of power relations in the contemporary world, and by so doing appear as little more than exercises in logic. "Justice", on this view, is whatever is produced by the assumptions of the theory. It has little to do with the actual distribution of power and resources in the world.</p>

<p>As a project, analytical Marxism had largely disappeared by the end of the 1990s. Most of its practitioners agreed that the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marxism.html" title="Marxism">Marxism</a> that in the beginning they had set out to interrogate and, to an extent, defend, was not theoretically or politically defensible. They concluded that as a theory for the explanation of human action, Marxism was a failure on both theoretical and practical grounds.</p>
<p>The leading lights of analytical marxism now focus their energies in other areas – such as moral and political philosophy (Cohen, van Parijs), and democratic theory employing economic models (Roemer, Elster).</p>
