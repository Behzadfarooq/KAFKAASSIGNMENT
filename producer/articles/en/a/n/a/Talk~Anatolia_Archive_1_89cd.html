<h2><span class="mw-headline">Greek not ancient Greek</span></h2>
<p>The word Ανατολή is used for thousends of years without interruption until today.It is used in every-day life, not as a literate term. Therefore I deleted the "ancient" as false.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">To be european or not to be european, that is the question</span></h2>
<p>European is an ambiguous term and is not the name of an ethnicity.</p>
<dl>
<dd>If someone said that the region of Ethiopia is populated by people of African ethnicities, or that Madagascar has a population partially of Asian/Austronesian origin, nobody would dispute that. But to say that "European" can actually refer to European ethnicities has somehow been warped during the 20th century into being perceived as a far-right concept... This is a double standard, which isn't being applied to other ethnic-spheres such as Native Americans, Africans, Polynesians, Chinese, Indians etc. Inuit don't stop being Inuit because of which side of the Bering Straight they're on, and the hundreds of millions of Semites don't stop being Semites depending on whether they're in Africa instead of Asia. Nobody would try to say that the Turkic peoples who live inside continental Europe aren't Turkic because of which side of the sea they're on.</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>a part of the European ethnic-sphere</i> I agree: a part of the Persian Empire, those of Alexander and his successors, of Rome, the Eastern Roman (i.e. Byzantine) Empire, but never part of a "European ethnic-sphere" whatever an "ethnic-sphere" might be. <a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">Wetman</a> 03:27, 20 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>maybe history of Anatolia makes sense for the Classical period (which I doubt, I think its Europeanistic thinking, but never mind), but it simply doesn't fit for the prehistoric period. What about creating a page 'prehistory of Turkey'? - which is simply based on current territory, not on any cultural (can't see the 'ethnic') entity?</p>

<p>"Today the inhabitants of Anatolia are mostly Turkish speakers, due to the conquest of Anatolia by Turkic peoples (and subsequent Islamification) in mediaeval times"</p>
<p>This is not true. The multiethnic character of Anatolia ended abruptly early in the 20th century. Anatolia was in ancient times Hellenic. After the battle of Mantzikert in 1071AD, the first Turks in significant numbers poured in. From that point on and until the Lausanne treaty in 1923, Anatolia was multiethnic, with Turks, Greeks, Armenians and Kurds in the east, being the main ethnic populations, along with others (like Assyrians, Jews, etc.) in smaller numbers. Proof of the multiethnic character of Anatolia are the turkish official population data of 1912. The present day "ethnically clean" turkic Anatolia is the result of the genocidal policies of Kemalism, with millions of victims, and after 1923, the exchange of populations provided by the Lausanne treaty. --<a href="../../../s/p/r/User%7ESpryom_5aa9.html" title="User:Spryom">Spryom</a> 12:20, 12 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is right. It is still true, however, that ultimately, it is due to the conquest, which happened in medieval times. But a statement hinting at what you say should be added, if possible phrased not to attract pov warriors (this is not the place to have discussions about the Armenian genocide). <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 10:40, 17 Dec 2004 (UTC)</small></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Anatolia/Popular etymology</span></h2>
<p>The reference to a turkish etymology of "Anatolia" as Ana-dolu is not correct. The term "Anatolia" for this area is ancient, it is included in ancient Greek and Byzantine writings, long before the turkic tribes appeared in the area and is the only correct etymology. The Turkish etynology has been invented centuries after the invention of the term itself. I suggest it is removed.--<a href="../../../s/p/r/User%7ESpryom_5aa9.html" title="User:Spryom">Spryom</a> 13:30, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think calling the Turkish meaning of Anatolia as FALSE popular etymologic information is crude behaviour. As far as I know even Europe is not a Greek word and its Sumerian oriented. Greek tribes vere living as independent cities, expecting ordinary Greeks whose life and vision is limited to small ranges to give a name to all Asia-minor even without any map making knowledge is quite questionable. They weren't even aware of the borders of Anatolia, Anatolia was just like Earth to them. This is also just like expcting people in ancient times to give PLANET a name. As you know our planet is called in many languages as the word which is used for to GROUND.</p>
<p>But Turks arrived later so they had clear differentiation sense about Asia-minor. I think new comers the named the Anatolia.</p>

<li>It doesn't seem you understand European history and you're obviously not a European.

<li>I believe that the article does not make crystal clear that Anadolu is not a real etymology but a a kind of retro-etymology ,a crude nationalistic attempt to establish historical ownership of the area. This comforms with the established official turkish history that want to portray pre-turkish civilisations in the area as in some way the ancestors of modern turks. There is no recognition that a cultural break occured after the arrival of turkic people in the area. On the other hand one must point out that no documented genocide of the people of Asia minor with the arrival of the turks exist and that Turks were at the time semi-nomadic and few in numbers. We can only assume that the existing people in Anatolia either left or were turkised rapidly in language and religion, severing their cultural ties with the past. Anyway i will like to see a clarification that by popular etymology the article means false etymology. As an answer to the anonymous commentator i can only say that it must be a very rare coincidence that the the Greek word for East that was used to describe a land east of Greece happens to also mean something complex in turkish like "mother-fill" and that mother-fill is actually the correct term.Any ideas on possible harsher wording that will make things clearer? --Aldourin 10:55, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ethnic Kurdish minority in Turkey</span></h2>
<p>User:69.110.57.242 (doesn't seem like a registered user) changed the reference to a "kurdish minority" to "signinficant number of Kurds". I believe that this edit is not correct and is due to political motivation. Official Turkish policy is not to recognise the existence of an ethnic Kurdish minority, while there are several millions of ethnic Kurds in southeastern Turkey. Please User:69.110.57.242, give us some arguments on why you changed the kurdish minority to a number of Kurds, otherwise the page should be reverted. --<a href="../../../s/p/r/User%7ESpryom_5aa9.html" title="User:Spryom">Spryom</a> 16:24, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I have reverted the page to the original reference of Kurds as an "ethnic and linguistic minority". Kurds are not Turks, they are a distinct nation that exists as a separate ethnic minority in Turkey, Iraq and Iran. They speak a different language, they have different customs. Their origins are ancient, and their separate ethnic and cultural identity are mentioned by Xenophon. The turkic tribes appeared in the kurdish lands only thousands of years later. --<a href="../../../s/p/r/User%7ESpryom_5aa9.html" title="User:Spryom">Spryom</a> 14:17, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Genocide allegations are nonsense, based on opinion, not history</span></h2>
<p>I presume that some person of probably Greek origin had written the basis of this article. Claiming that Turks had "genocided" or "mass murdered" i.e. Greeks, Armenians and Kurds during WW1, COMPLETELY NONSENSE.</p>
<p>If you read history (not that what you´re being taught in Greece, because it´s probably biased), you would realise, that in fact the Greeks are guilty of killing Turks and other moslem subjects of the Ottoman Empire. This is a fact, not an opinion. I suggest you read a very good book on this issue, namely "the Ottoman Turks" by Prof. Justin McCarthy. He is neutral, without bias and knows what he´s talking about.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to provide you with more accurate information, here are a few quotes based on reports of British diplomats during WW1 and Turkish War of Independence. After asterisque (*) you cand find the ID tag of the report, go look at the archives if you want to check:</p>
<hr />
<p>14 FEBRUARY 1919 According to the report, which was sent by Admiral Richard Webb in Istanbul to A. J. Balfour, the Foreign Minister, Greeks entered Turkish villages and grabbed everything they wanted and harassed the Turkish women sexually. The report reads:</p>
<p>"Once, in order to entertain themselves, they opened fire on the muezzin, who was climbing up the minaret to recite the ezan. According to Admiral Webb, the behavior of the Greeks in Istanbul had not been anticipated . (*)"</p>
<p>(*) FO/4161/38713.</p>
<p>29 MARCH 1919</p>
<p>The passages from a confidential letter sent from businessman David Forbes in Izmir to Sir George Riddel:</p>
<p>"I witnessed very nasty events both in Izmir and in its environs. They were caused mostly by the Greek propaganda provoking the Turks. For the time being, it would be a grave mistake to give this territory to Greeks (*)."</p>
<p>(*) FO/4165/70511.</p>
<p><br />
27 MAY 1919</p>
<p>The report given by General James Morgan, the English Consul:</p>
<p>"Izmir, 30 July 1919. Greek troops occupied Aydın on May 2. Then, the Moslems were arrested; imprisoned and they tore apart their fezzes. 48 Moslems were killed in Chalki and Karabina Stations in the West of Aydın by the Greeks (*)."</p>
<p>(*) FO/4220/118406.</p>
<p>17 JUNE 1919</p>
<p>MASSACRE COMMITTED IN MENEMEN</p>
<p>After Izmir was occupied by the Greeks, James Morgan reported to Admiral Calthorpe, the English High Commissioner in Istanbul in mid-June that a French military officer coming from Menemen on June 18 reported the killing by Greeks of 100 Turks in Menemen and that the Moslem residents of the town were in panic (1). An English military officer, who was incidentally in Menemen on 17 June 1919, told that the Greeks were responsible for all the incidents occurring there; and mentioned a massacre. At the same time, he pointed out the fact, as if reminding the following day of St. Bartholomew, that all Greeks had drawn a white cross on their doors. Evaluating the report about the massacre committed on 19 August 1919 in Menemen, C.E.S. Palmer from the English Foreign Ministry made the following observations:</p>
<p>"This is a most distressing incident. Turks could not do this to themselves even if they were blind. Any Turk knowing French history well or familiar with an English military officer could not do the same thing. In short, all these appear to be against Greeks (2)."</p>
<p>The massacre was committed on June 17. After being defeated, Greeks, killed on retreating a prominent Turk heading for the station. A Greek soldier bayoneted the district governor; and his corpse was left on the stairs of the district governorship building. Local Greek bandits massacred everyone they could get hold of during their journey, as they did in Izmir. Plundering and pillage are continuing. It is reckoned that 200 Turks were massacred. These events were reported to Admiral Calthorpe (3).</p>
<p>23 JUNE 1919</p>
<p>PLUNDERING IN EMİRKÖY AND KADIKÖY</p>
<p>In the report Major Hadkinson, the English Reserve Officer, sent to the High Commissioner in early September 1919, he touched upon the incidents of June 23 and told the following:</p>
<p>"After the armed clash taking place between the Greek troops and the Turkish civilians , Greeks repulsed Turks; then they plundered Emirköy and Kadıköy, the Turkish villages, and set them on fire."</p>
<p><br />
25 JUNE 1919</p>
<p>MASSACRE IN AYDIN</p>
<p>"The Greek troops in Aydın opened fire on the Turkish villages on three sides. Many Turkish villages were plundered; after they beat their residents, they set the houses on fire. Then, they started pounding the Turkish houses. While the Turks were going out of their houses with their bodies on fire, the Greek soldiers opened fired on them with machine guns; and the civilian Greeks armed by the Greek soldiers shot them to death.</p>
<p>After occupying Aydın, Greeks arrested all the leading Turkish figures there. They conducted a house to house search under the pretext that they were looking for firearms. They harassed the women's quarters; insulted them and captured all the precious belongings of women.</p>
<p>Using machine guns, Greeks killed all the people they found, including some Christians. Moreover , they killed all the Moslems they captured to establish security. . They shot women and children to death inside their houses; and set houses on fire. They carried out all imaginable abominable atrocities while massacring innocent armless people.</p>
<p>According to the London Moslems' Association, the most brutal attack that can be made by a human occurred while four Turkish women were defending their houses with the guns of their husbands. These women were arrested, and impaled to death. In addition to the long list of losses, 9176 Turks were estimated to have been massacred (1)."</p>
<p>"While Turkish combatants were approaching, Greeks decided to vacate Aydın. The Greek population in Aydın went crazy; going to Greek Colonel Skinas, they pleaded with him to let them go together with the Greek soldiers. Greek civilians of 4-5 thousands crossed the line to reach safety. But, the remaining population was forced to return; they were threatened with bayonets to stop their evacuation.</p>
<p>According to Major Hadkinson, what Greek Colonel Skinas did upon their plead was to reject helping these miserable people. Furthermore, although the number of Greek soldiers was 3.000 and they were well armed, they drove back upon the forwarding 1.500 Turkish combatants.</p>
<p>Colonel Skinas was soon seized and imprisoned for 20 years. 40 Turks had been surrounded by the Greek military troops. They were called for four times to surrender. According to Major Hadkinson's report, these 40 Turks fought against the Greek soldiers; and they were all killed on the battlefield (2)."</p>

<p>Major Hadkinson's report, Ayvalık (İzmir):</p>
<p>"Greeks commit massacres in Kasaba (Turgutlu), Izmir and Nazilli. Turkish gendarmes and police forces were disarmed; their equipment was stolen; and they were subjected to very harsh treatment. It became known through several reports that Turks were subjected to such violent acts as murder, thefts, rape etc. In the suburbs, lots of dismembered corpses, with their internal organs cut into pieces , were found. Greek battalions were patrolling the city.</p>
<p>Greeks searched the Turkish houses. Although they said that they had no guns; Greek soldiers beat them. Thinking that their doors were not easily broken, they went into their houses. Armed Greek soldiers started searching the houses. All the Turkish villages near Ayvalık were evacuated; the residents had fled their houses without even taking their belongings. There were about 20 families in Ayazmalı. They wereelderly people for the most part.. All of them were locked into a house and a watchman was assigned before the door of the house.</p>
<p>On the following days, a systematic plundering and pillage took place; most of the precious belongings were taken to Mytilene on boats. . The people of Mytilene came with their own boats and plundered the villages. Local Greeks who were there earlier did not allow them to plunder Ayvalık and Yeni Zahorili; but later participated in the plundering operation together with the Greek soldiers.</p>
<p>The 20 families who surrendered were plundered. All the Turks, including those who came from the neighboring villages to the village of Boklu Kaya to take shelter , send message from Ayazmalı to inform that they wanted to return their guns. Nonetheless, the Greeks, who were wearing khakis and followed by a band, had flags and trumpets in their hands; they, first of all, attacked the village; took all they caught and harassed the Turkish women sexually.</p>
<p>The Greek soldiers captured a large number of oxen used for ploughing; and cut them into pieces brutally. Before the vacation of the Eighth Greek Regiment, they killed 200 oxen used for ploughing according to Major Hadkinson's report; they told that they sacrificed these animals for the victory God bestowed on them (*)."</p>

<p>"According to the Greek authorities, this occupation contributed nothing to the image of Greece; but harmed it. It was stated in most of the writings in the pro-Venizelos press, Times magazine etc. that the cruel commission held Turks responsible for most of these acts; the report presented by the commission is a clear indication of Greek patience and moderation. It was also stated that a Greek scout was killed since he did not greet the Turkish flag. (However, in reality, the Greek scouts would show the leading Turks to the Greek soldiers, so that the Greek soldiers killed them both in Aydın and in other places.)</p>
<p>In spite of all these writings, the Greek official bodies admitted that the Greeks in Anatolia acted violently, and this made a bad impression on other states. Many subjects (the Ottoman Greek) objected to the annexation to Greece. The chauvinistic party led by the Orthodox Metropolitan of Izmir was an exception to it. Because, they supported the annexation.

25 FEBRUARY 1920 The confidential letter sent by Harold Francis to the Foreign Ministry reads:</p>
<p>" I had great interest in Turkey (not economic); and lived there for years. On behalf of my self and other Europeans; I urge you to oppose the decision of the allies who made a grave mistake by giving Aydın , Bursa and Izmir, the most important port of the Asian and European Turkey, to dishonorable Greeks.</p>
<p>Neither Izmir, nor Aydın or Bursa was densely populated by Greeks, even with the addition of the Ottoman Greeks to given population figure. There are 1.500.000 Moslems, 500.000 Orthodox Ottoman Greeks, 150.000 others such as Jews, Armenians, Europeans and other foreigners.</p>
<p>Because of this reason, Greeks do not have the right to govern a majority larger than themselves, be they a Moslem majority, a Christian majority or else, especially when they hate and look down on all of them.</p>
<p>Setting foot on Izmir in May, Greeks killed 700 unarmed Moslems. The Greek troops started occupying the cities with the permission of the allies; they damaged all the buildings, set Turkish villages on fire, and killed brutally the Moslem people who could not flee their homes. The Moslems killed were the most moderate and obedient villagers.</p>
<p>Not all parts of the lands were fit for agriculture. . Both the Moslem and Christian owners of these lands were industrious and clever. These lands can not be left to the brutal, bribe-giving Greek government simply because the Ottoman government was incompetent. Nobody can understand that.</p>
<p>Neither the Moslem Turks including a large number of Moslem Bulgarians nor the Christian population including Europeans, Levantines, Malteses (English citizens) can yield to the rule of a dishonorable and cruel group. Unless the Greek government is driven away from these lands, the civil war and violent incidents will continue.</p>
<p>Leaving Izmir to Greece is like giving Liverpool to Russia or Marseilles or Havre to Germany.</p>

<p>English Intelligence report No. 100:</p>
<p>"When King Constantin returned to Greece, pro-Venizelos people in Istanbul founded an organization called the National Defense Committee, an affiliate body of the Greek Politics Club. This organization had close relations with the Fener Patriarchate. It was led by Alexandros Voutiras and its editor was Neologos. Thanks to Neologos' influential contacts, this organization managed to establish close relations with lots of rich businessmen and journalists. The committee also included a military group consisting of several pro-Venizelos officers. The aim of the committee was to cause a moderate movement against the regime in Greece. In the committee, the issue of re-establishing the Byzantine Empire was discussed and approved.

<p>"According to the complaint by the Turkish Government, Greeks issued false declarations stating that Greeks, as the occupying force, were very moderate. They claimed that these declarations had been signed and approved by the prominent Moslem figures in Anatolia. This was a false claim. In late February, the Greek officials in the internal parts of Anatolian lands were instructed to issue Moslem declarations expressing consistently the above-mentioned idea that the continuity of Greek rule in occupqied lands is wanted by the population in general.</p>
<p>All the means at hand were used to ensure such declarations. Some Turks were forced to sign such documents. Some were made drunk, some forced to sign an empty paper so that the declaration could be written afterwards. Greeks even told some of them that those documents were the permission papers for the supply of tobacco and bread.</p>
<p>Those trying to issue such declarations used torture as a means. In general, all Moslems forced to sign these documents were afraid to refuse signing them. Of course, not all of them happened at the same time (*)."</p>

<p>In the letter that the London Moslems' Association sent to the English Prime Minister to reflect the suffering of the Moslem population in Asia Minor and the desperate struggle of the Turkish refugees expelled from Thrace on 12 March 1921; the following was stated:</p>
<p>"Those done in Yenice reveal the suffering of the Turkish people under Greek rule. It is heard every day that some Turkish leading figures and educated people are arrested on the grounds of baseless complaints. Some people are imprisoned without being put on trial and subjected to torture.</p>
<p>Buildings belonging to Turks are raided and Turkish women raped. There is almost no one who is not immune to being harassed one way or another when going to his distant farm. We witness or hear every day that a Turk was killed. In spite of all these, nothing was made stop the murderous Greeks.</p>
<p>Last week, I witnessed that four Turkish drivers were killed on the Menemen-Izmir way; I also heard that eight Turks were strangled in somewhere near Izmir. The point I want to state is that the Greek government or which so much praise wasz heaped is far removed from being a modern government.</p>
<p>In short, this government can be described as the government that has been organized particularly to kill or eliminate the Turks. Apparently, the Greeks' primary aim is to drive Turks away from Izmir. In addition to these aggressions that are often encountered, another important thing, which deeply saddened Turks , is that Moslem women and girls are forced to prostitution through all means.</p>
<p>Instead of carrying out their duties, Greek officers entertain themselves by forcing Turkish women to go out without their veils on. This committee wants to draw your attention to the plight of thousands of Thracian Moslems who were driven away from their historical homelands and died of hunger and poverty on the banks of the Istanbul Strait (*)."</p>

Greek soldiers carried out acts of violence everywhere.</p>
<p>Hacı Mustafa Köy suffered the most. Seven men and one woman were killed and six women were raped. Kurufali and Ahva are among the suffering villages. A man named Salih was twice hanged from his feet forn a total two hours. They did the same in the villages of Şuhupli, Üzeyir and Kemal. Relatives of Nefsa, Emine and Fatma from Hacı Mustafa Köyü were killed. Halil Mehmet Hoca, their maternal uncle, was also killed.</p>

<p>"This event happened in a location one hour from Istanbul. I wonder whether the Government of His Majesty is informed of this event?"</p>
<p>Answering this question on behalf of the Prime Minister, Mr. Chamberlain told the following:</p>
<p>"According to the report the Commission of Allied Forces wanted conveyed to the English Government, some of those told actually happened in the region. However, the real figures have not been confirmed yet."</p>
<p>Mr. Herbert made the following evaluation:</p>
<p>"If the English Government had genuinely wanted to be informed, would this information have been obtained through our Embassy or the Naval authorities? I wonder whether the complaints made about the killings of 5500 unarmed persons in the region excluded from the war harm your prestige? It may be thought that we had these done (*)"</p>

<p>"According to General Frank's report; Greek divisions are moving back to Yalova; they are setting on fire all the villages along the coast. The Investigation Commission warmly welcomed by nationalists carried out examinations in Izmir. No evidence as to the massacre of Christians was found. Officials of the American Hospital and French religious officers stated clearly their contentment with the discipline and behavior of Kemalists.</p>
<p>The Greek tyranny including killings, torture, mutilation and pillage was revealed by pulling the corpses out of the grave. According to the statements made, these acts of violence were perpetrated by drunk and undisciplined Greek soldiers during the Greek occupation with the assistance of Christian and Armenian bandits, which is confirmed by Americans. The commission finds the acts of retreating Greeks shameful for a modern nation. (*)" It was demanded through Lord Granville's cipher dated 5.7.1921 and numbered 204 that the above-mentioned points be conveyed to the Greek government and Greek soldiers be protested for their acts.</p>

<p>"The following are the passages quoted from the private letter coming to Sir Haryy Lamb. These were written after the talks with the Greek Commissioner&#160;:</p>
<p>"I wrote similar things to this before. But I am very worried now. Greeks have understood that they have to vacate here; and they decided to leave a desert behind . They do not care about who will suffer from this. As long as there is time and means, they will certainly take everything they seize to Greece. Turks will be pillaged; their homeland , their houses will be set on fire. All the belongings of foreigners will be seized, and they will be left to their own. Since Greeks have believed up to now that we have to help them, they did not damage the belongings of the English. But they have seen we have turned our back on them; which has made them ready to bite us just as they did the others. " Sir Harry Lamb discussed with the Greek high commissioner the issue of damaged Turkish villages and destroyed mosques. The Greek Commissioner while saying that he had not been informed of these atrocities on the one hand, stressed , on the other , the necessity of inflicting such damage . He even said that incidents of this kind are inevitable while an army retreats , adding that civilian authorities should hold themselves responsible for vetoing these incidents as far as political and humane thoughts were concerned.</p>

<dd>Welcome to the wonderful world of propaganda. Writing history is *not* simply quoting the bits of material that supports one's own view while ignoring all the rest.

<dd>Amazing effort, pittiful result.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Firstly, most of the above quotes belong to lower rank officers and foreigners living in Anatolia and harmed by the change in government.I do not really see some official papers signed by a highest rank officer and most importantly by a minister, a diplomat or a High Commisioner. Pardon me to not have the patience to read all the quotes presented here but from the little I manged to read this is the POV which I did derive. Secondly, I think your conclusion is based on a totally mistaken basis in the begining. A genocide is something organised, usually from a nation's government (not some furious soldiers) against another nation not necessarily during a war period, and happens in cold blood and huge numbers, following a specific method/pattern of extermination over a prolonged period of years. What the above quotes show is a totally different situation. These mention some reports for Greek violence during the heat of battle against a small number of civilians in scattered villages all over anatolia for a period of 2-3 years during the Greco-Turkish war. While these incidents are not honoring the Greek Arms in any way, they do not in any case constitute a policy of extermination/genocide. Allow me this example; By concluding the above is like saying that the Allied NATO Forces entering the Iraqi region and procceeding to some unjustifiable attrocities, over the local population (which may belong to the local Islamic fatria btw) is the equivalent of a NATO genocide policy against the people of Iraq. My friend I will put it as simple as possible "Wake Up!". Turks are the only People on this Earth commited so many crimes in such a small period of time (Turkish history spans less than 600 years of "civilised" being, not including the life in the mongolian steppes ofcourse) with such a little offering in the world culture and society. It is rather funny to designate genocidal policies to the GREEKS. As you may know the Greeks in their 3000+ history, many times being in a role of total world dominance, had the "oportunity" to inflict extermination policies upon numerous of foreign peoples, yet they never, ever did so. Either you like it or not The Armenian Genocide, The Hellenic Genocide, The Pontic Greek Genocide and the ongoing Kurdish Genocide, are well known in the Western world (which by the way is a zero-possibility game for you to participate in, if you continue acting like this) and characterise your nation. It would be more honest and civilised stance to finally ACCEPT your past than trying to erase it so brutaly. Finally remember, the Germans also had a bad past period of commiting a Genocide against the Jews in Europe. The difference is that they had the honesty to ACCEPT so and ask for a PARDON by the Global society and History itself. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstavrou_d84c.html" title="User:Astavrou">Astavrou</a> 07:28, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Kudos and disappointment-- What is here, is great; but was very disappointed that there is no section giving a synopsis of the various city states, and civilizations akin to the timeline. Many ancient civilizations had their heyday on the world stage in classical times and occupied a part of the region, and to not survey such cities and other larger kingdoms (e.g. the hitites) that occupied the region with a summary paragraph or two is a crime. Further, such references as Troy (roman numeral, various) need some explaination.</p>
<p>OTOH, the geography section is masterful, though at times a tad obtuse using terms or references that have not been introduced here and there, but all in all, worthy of praise! A special map deliniating plains, arable regions, hills, and mountains would be a good addition.
