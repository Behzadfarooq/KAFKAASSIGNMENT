<p>Regarding your editing of "religious conservatives" to "conservatives from some religions": I'm unaware of any religions whose conservative base does not oppose pornography. I won't touch that sentence again if you can provide me with at least one religion that, across the board, does not oppose pornography. This is out of sheer curiosity, not an eagerness to contradict, by the way; if there is such a religion I don't know of it. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperking_ceb7.html" title="User:Superking">The Amazing Superking</a> 21:23, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>i wonder if we should discuss on the pornography discussion pages? the problem is that "conservatives" can be bastardized to include true zealots from any religious. however, in the main for example, buddhism, taoism, even mainstream hindu religion, have no real formal position on pornography that i'm aware of. there are however, always zealous minorities in pretty near *any* religion that will oppose even the baring of an ankle - the problem is, they are not necessarily what would be termed 'conservatives'. it's a sticky wicket, to say the least. perhaps just leaving it at 'religious conservatives' is clear enough i suppose...<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnastrophe-wikipedia_d908.html" title="User:Anastrophe-wikipedia">Anastrophe</a> 21:32, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Anastrophe. I just want to say I agree with what you stand on anonymous editors: allowing users to simply identify themselves by their (dynamic) IP address is more trouble than it's worth. Cheers, --<a href="../../../a/_/b/User%7EA_bit_iffy_397a.html" title="User:A bit iffy">A bit iffy</a> 13:10, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Me too; and I've done something about it, putting the case on the Village Pump [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_(policy)#Require_registration_.28log-in.29_to_edit" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_(policy)#Require_registration_.28log-in.29_to_edit" rel="nofollow">(here)</a>]. I've been bleating about this now for a while in my edit summaries, endlessly reverting the graffiti; this may be a bit more effective. I encourage you to support the move on Village Pump.

<dd>I also agree with you about not permitting anonymous editors to create and edit. I had thus far edited and wrote on less publicized articles that weren't vandalized. I'd frequently read of edit wars against vandals but didn't realize the severity of this problem until my participation on the <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosa_Parks_bff2.html" title="Rosa Parks">Rosa Parks</a> article. I contributed substantially to the article and would find that the page would consistently be vandalized with hate messages or pranks. It no longer became "fun" to write for the article as it started to become a chore to have to combat these pranksters and malicious anonymous "editors". I also wrote in the Village Pump that registration only takes a few seconds but it shows commitment. While it can't deter everyone, it helps deter a lot of the quick pranksters. Wikipedia could have a system where you register with a userid and valid email. The system emails you to confirm that it is a real email address. That way, there's at least something to refer back to when there's vandalism. I do hope that Wikipedia changes its "easy" edit policies. I am all for democracy and ease of edit, etc. but I think that history has shown that while the concept is great in a Utopian society, it can't work in real life because there are just too many people with itchy hands or evil thoughts who wish to mess things up. It also unfairly leans an article very heavily on the shoulders of several people who have to become the article's manager(s)/keeper(s) for good. Not a good way to scale or expand at all.

<p>Hi Anastrophe.</p>
<p>Can you explain how my comment on <a href="../../../g/l/o/Talk%7EGlobal_warming_d6c7.html" title="Talk:Global warming">Talk:Global warming</a> can be interpreted as an <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">Ad hominem</a> (i.e. an attack at the man, not the argument)? Which argument? Which man? Thanks.</p>
<p>As for your Krakatoa remark: Unless I'm mistaken, Krakatoa had no long-term effect on the CO2 signal. It did have some short and medium term effect on the climate, of course, but that is not the same. I am not aware of any reasonable short- or medium term natural developments that would influence the CO2 signal in a significant way compared to the human signal. So I think your edit overstates the uncertainty. Note that the IPCC has made a number of projections based on different human emission scenarios.</p>

<p>Hello. I saw that you removed an image from the <a href="../../../s/u/r/Survivor_%28TV_series%29_7392.html" title="Survivor (TV series)">Survivor</a> article, citing that it was a spoiler image. I put an image of tribal council there for two reasons. First, that part of the article contains a lot of whitespace and looks blank. Second, that area of the article discusses tribal council. I thought since there is a spoiler image at the top of the article and since it was an episode that previously aired it would have been okay to post that image. I would still like to have an image there, or at least something to cover that white space. Could you let me know what you think would be a more suitable image? Possibly one from the very first tribal council of Guatemala? Thanks. <a href="../../../j/t/r/User%7EJtrost_cae9.html" title="User:Jtrost">Jtrost</a> 00:37, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Extrapolation is informed speculation, not fiction. The data points are historical, the extrapolation explains more than 98% of their variation, and has only an 18% chance of doing so by chance. Would you have any problems if the graph had 95% confidence interval bands, above and below the extrapolation? <a href="../../../n/r/c/User%7ENrcprm2026_854a.html" title="User:Nrcprm2026">Nrcprm2026</a> 20:14, 20 December 2005 (UTC) (copied here from my talk page)</p>

<dd>easy. compare to the first two revisions of the same graph. in fact, why not create a graph showing the confidence interval of these three models against each other. then tell me your graph is reliable. i am in the process of posting a 'critique' of these graphs on my user page.Anastrophe 20:19, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>the "data set" on your page is a fundamental part of the problem. it is NOT a dataset. it is an estimation by examination of the values on an extant graph, and does not reference the *actual source data* used to generate that graph. furthermore, the dataset ends in 1998 - it is nearly eight years out of date, and incomplete. you are "predicting" values for which data already exists - it would be interesting to see how that eight year interval compares with your 'predictions' of already past history. but clearly, you are hell-bent to have this graph on wikipedia - what your motivation is i can only guess, but i would surmise you're a global warming hysteric, since you had no problem embracing 4 trillion as the cost in a previous graph. i could be wrong; it's just my opnion. wikipedia, however, suffers further as a reference source with the inclusion of this meaningless graph. i'm done. have fun. <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnastrophe-wikipedia_d908.html" title="User:Anastrophe-wikipedia">Anastrophe</a> 20:55, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Back when I took statistics, there was nothing wrong with digitizing data from a graph. I agree that it would be great to have the 1999-2005 data, and I want to encourage you to try to find it. I do believe that <a href="../../../w/i/n/Wind_power.html" title="Wind power">wind power</a> is a very important but neglected alternative to fossil fuels. I believe that makes me a realist, not a "hysteric." In any case, thank you for the helpful comments early on. <a href="../../../n/r/c/User%7ENrcprm2026_854a.html" title="User:Nrcprm2026">James P.

<dd>i have not made, nor do i make, any claims of being a statistician, (or economist for that matter!). the onus is upon you to find the raw source data; you are the person who is making these extrapolations from an incomplete dataset. i believe also that wind energy is neglected, but i don't think it's as important as advances in solar power, which will eventually prove to be the only (and best, by far) alternative to fossil fuels, in my opinion. though it may seem like it, i have no <i>personal</i> ill-will towards you - i don't know you from Adam - but i do think that these speculations about future costs - which have vacillated wildly - are not helpful. stick to graphing the already-incurred costs. that should be more than cautionary enough. it is troubling to me that the IPCC's raw data is so difficult to find. <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnastrophe-wikipedia_d908.html" title="User:Anastrophe-wikipedia">Anastrophe</a> 21:34, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let me drop in my 3.141592652589793238462643383279502884197... cents: the second graph, from what I read, differs only that it is more precise - it uses more data points, and thus the expectation is, by information theory, expected to be a more accurate (and thus therefore different, yes) prediction than the first graph. The third graph has a different vertical axis, and is thus altogether unrelated to the first two, pending a transformation function between the two spaces, and lacking or not lacking such a function (unless the function is f(x)=x), the graphs are expected by mere common sense to be completely different.</p>
<p>So if your intent here was to show statistics lying, you failed. People can decieve by using less accurate statistics or simply using the wrong measures on one axis. But that is no fault of statistics, that's incompetence or maliciousness on the part of the person exploiting people's ignorance, rather than contributing to their education. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_baas_eec8.html" title="User:Kevin baas">Kevin baas</a> 18:40, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The vertical and horizontal axes are both exactly the same on all three graphs. The only people who accuse me of lying are those in deep denial about the relation between <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radiative_forcing.html" title="Radiative forcing">radiative forcing</a> and the strength of storms. Greater atmospheric energy means increases in storm strength and average windspeed. The tortured and pathetic arguments of those who deny the obvious connection remind me of the antiheliocentrics against Copernicus. —<a href="../../../n/r/c/User%7ENrcprm2026_854a.html" title="User:Nrcprm2026"><i>James S.</i></a> 04:53, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>Anastrophe, please do not take this the wrong way, but your tone, infliction and manner of writing makes me believe you most likely have very few friends.<a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShoessss_80c5.html" title="User:Shoessss">Shoessss</a> 02:15, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>the art of the sidestepped ad hominem. brilliantly executed. listen, if you don't like honesty, perhaps wikipedia isn't a good fit for you. littering articles with opinions and feel-good commentary is unencyclopedic. i suggest you start a blog, rather than edit what is ostensibly an encyclopedia. (i believe i hurt mr. shoessss feelings with the summaries i tendered for my edits on <a href="../../../h/y/b/Hybrid_Generator_b229.html" title="Hybrid Generator">Hybrid Generator</a> and related article.) <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnastrophe-wikipedia_d908.html" title="User:Anastrophe-wikipedia">Anastrophe</a> 16:59, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And by your response, you prove my point. Regarding the edits, when I post an article or add significantly to an article, I do not mind criticisms and suggestions from any and all editors. However, the tone and infliction does give me pause on how I take their edits and suggestions. Try diplomacy once in awhile. You may be surprised with the outcomes. Either way, have a great day. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShoessss_80c5.html" title="User:Shoessss">Shoessss</a> 17:19, 31 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>you seem to be deeply unclear on the concept (as well as the correct spelling of 'inflection'). your initial comment is an egregious ad hominem, that you attempt to cloak with syrupy intonations such as "have a great day". spare me the condescension. the number of friends I have - or lack - is irrelevant to the veracity of the summary i used in editing the articles. your use of ad hominem attack does nothing to counter my comments, nor further your argument. i would again suggest that perhaps you might consider another hobby if your feelings are so easily hurt by the cold slap of reality. and again, rather than cluttering the user discussion of both our pages, how about discussing the matter in the article discussion area. that's the wikipedia way of dealing with the issue. <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnastrophe-wikipedia_d908.html" title="User:Anastrophe-wikipedia">Anastrophe</a> 17:47, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
