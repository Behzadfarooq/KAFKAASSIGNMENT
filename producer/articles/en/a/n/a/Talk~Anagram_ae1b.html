<p>Palindromes and logograms are not anagrams. I have removed the following text as it does not belong here:</p>
<p>Another species of anagram, called <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palindrome.html" title="Palindrome">palindrome</a> (Greek <i>palin</i>, "back", and <i>dromos</i>, "running"), is a word or sentence which may be read backwards as well as forwards, letter by letter, while preserving the same meaning; for example, the words "Anna," "noon," "tenet," or the sentence with which Adam is humorously supposed to have greeted Eve: "Madam, I'm Adam!"</p>
<p>A still more complicated variety is the <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logogram.html" title="Logogram">logogram</a> (Greek <i>logos</i>, "word"), a <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verse.html" title="Verse">versified</a> <a href="../../../p/u/z/Puzzle.html" title="Puzzle">puzzle</a> containing several words derived from recombining the letters of the original word, the difficulty lying in the fact that <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synonym.html" title="Synonym">synonyms</a> of the derived words may be used.

<p>Great article, but I found a few of the anagrams listed a little inappropriate. The Linford Christie one made me smile (well, a little), but is rather lame and unsavoury really. As for the Abu Ghraib one, it looks to me like the punch-line from a pretty tasteless joke.

<p>There are two words that are original to the book of <i>Revelation</i>: "Nicolaitanes" and "Armageddon". Christ said he hates the deeds and doctrine of the Nicolaitanes. "Nicolaitanes" is an anagram for "O satanic line," a reference to the beast line of the Ouzo Cross (see<a href="http://tycho.i8.com/ouzo/ouzopapers.pdf" class="external text" title="http://tycho.i8.com/ouzo/ouzopapers.pdf" rel="nofollow">"The Ouzo Prophecy"</a>). Armageddon is the location of the final battle between good and evil. "Armageddon" is an anagram for "Dame Dragon," a generalized personification of evil, similar to other generalized personifications such as Mother Nature and Lady Luck. Anagrams are related to gematria in that both are number/letter codes, anagrams being based on ordinal numbers and gematria on cardinal numbers.</p>

<p>I'm sure someone will have a nice feast on the random sprawling in-joke cuteness of this groaning list of barf. sorry. some of them are funny. torch this jonk. <a href="../../../d/z/z/User%7EDzzl_f07e.html" title="User:Dzzl">Ish</a> <sup><font color="maroon">(<a href="../../../j/o/u/Journal_of_Scientific_Exploration_be24.html" title="Journal of Scientific Exploration">fake science alert</a>)</font> 03:52, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</sup></p>
<dl>
<dd>Several thoughts. First, NPOV is somewhat of a non-issue with the anagrams themselves, as they are not intended to actually assert anything factual. This article needs to be neutral; the anagrams need not be. (I'm not sure if that's what you were getting at with your section heading, however.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>indeed the examples don't assert facts, but I think they're screaming POVness could be a little toned down in places. <a href="../../../d/z/z/User%7EDzzl_f07e.html" title="User:Dzzl">Ish</a> <sup><font color="maroon">(<a href="../../../s/m/a/Smack_my_bitch_up.html" title="Smack my bitch up">shoot some</a>)</font> 07:15, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</sup></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Barf," on the other hand, is sometimes in the eye of the beholder. As mere jokes, many of these anagrams leave something to be desired, I'll grant you. What makes an anagram notable, however, is a sort of "wow" factor in the relation of coincidence in letter arrangements and the resulting meaning. Coming up with a new anagram that will really impress experienced anagrams takes work, skill, patience, and a ton of pure luck. What an anagrammist aims for is something that will "wow" even the most experienced of his peers. Anagrammists are usually extremely clever, verbally and otherwise.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Not sure whether it's on the list (I'll add it if it isn't), but here is a quite remarkable anagram:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Eleven plus two = Twelve plus one</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What makes it notable is its simplicity, and the fact that it is mathematically true (11 + 2 = 13; 12 + 1 = 13). It is verbally and mathematically anagrammatic.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Allow me to present you with a challenge</b>: Make an anagram of the phrase "fake science alert". Aim for 1] all English words, the larger, the better; 2] a perfect anagram, using each letter once and only once; and 3] a meaning that comments on the original phrase in a clever, descriptive, ironic, or humorous way -- and without having to be explained to be understood and appreciated. Use a computer if you have to. Leave your result here and see how our results compare. Time is a factor here.</dd>

<dd>Oh, Ian, surely you cannot believe that these anagrams need to be removed?! <b>By their very nature</b> anagrams express opinions, humor, irony, etc. They must be included, merely as examples, and treated like <b>quotations</b>. Do we delete quotations because they express a POV? Of course not. No reasonable user is going to say, "Gee, I think this article is slanted." <s>I am reverting the page;</s> <i>(Sorry, thought you actually removed the anagrams, not the tag...! <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Klenk_243c.html" title="User:Paul Klenk">paul klenk</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_Klenk_4cff.html" title="User talk:Paul Klenk"><sup>talk</sup></a> 13:21, 2 October 2005 (UTC))</i> if you would like to include a "neutrality disputed" tag in the article (where they belong -- not on a talk page), go ahead and place one there so people are directed to this discussion. Okay, one person made a comment, after they have been here for ages now. I don't think the comment should be construed as a serious dispute.

<dd>Ish, glad you liked my anagrams. I do believe some on the page are corny, and your observation about junk e-mail is quite valid, and should be addressed carefully. So let's do this. This will be a challenge -- we can't just remove anagrams that offend our own sensibilities about humor, politics, and whatnot. <i>That</i> would be POV. I will try to find the "anagrammy scale" which helps evaluate the quality of anagrams; you will find it interesting. Perhaps we can also copy the anagrams here (not remove them) and we can make comments next to those nominated for deletion. Please tell me, too: did you intend your remark as a serious dispute of the NPOV of the article, or was it closer to an offhand remark? Read my comments to Ian if it was the former. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Klenk_243c.html" title="User:Paul Klenk">paul klenk</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_Klenk_4cff.html" title="User talk:Paul Klenk"><sup>talk</sup></a> 13:17, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay, I've started with <i>minor</i> cleanups, focusing on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consistency of form, punctuation, capitalization and italization</li>
<li>Removing extremely obscure anagrams which are not at all notable or understandable without an explanation, or which have no explanation (non sequiturs)</li>
<li>Adding a section for celebrities and other persons -- more will be added</li>
<li>Removing extraneous text</li>
<li>Replacing a couple of equal signs (=) with tildes (~) for anagrams which form a complete sentence</li>
</ul>
<p>I will look at others, but I truly do not see many more that are egregiously non-notable. For the sake of brevity, however, perhaps a few could be trimmed.</p>

<p>Call me sceptical if u like, but it strikes me as just too coincidental that the Romans called the art of finding anagrams <i>ars magna</i>, which just happens to be an anagram of "anagrams". It really sounds like an urban myth to me (but a very good one, admittedly).

<p>i didn't see any reference here with regard to 'synonymic anagrams'. to my knowledge this phrase was originally coined by Barclay Mitchell, songwriter (guitarist/vocalist) for the punk rock/hardcore band 'Man Without Plan' off the track "To Whom You Must Pay the Toll" from there 2nd full length CD "I Feel Badly" (2000) (i don't have it in front of me but i'm mostly certain it was on the Creep Records label.) the excerpted lyric is as follows "You and I are synonymic anagrams like 'notes' &amp; 'tones', same letters and meanings but inside-out we both know..." that phrasing and terminology has always intrigued but i've ne'er come across another outside of 'notes' and 'tones'. all thoughts and input are greatly welcomed. driprock August 1st, 2006</p>

<ul>
<li>In "Anagrammatic" an online interactive game provided by Miniclip, worldwide players follow the rules of "Countdown" (above) where they are given 30 seconds to form the longest word out of nine letters. After four rounds they are asked to form a nine letter word. Points are awarded and subtracted accordingly. Players enthusiastically converse on the game's forum using a variety of graphics, mostly thanking each other for games but also complaining bitterly about the words which are rejected by the ruling dictionary. Players use pseudonyms (Little Brat, Little Taz, <a href="../../../t/o/r/Tori_Amos_da88.html" title="Tori Amos">Tori Amos</a>, Spellerbee etc)and have created a hierarchy based on the awarded points which progress from light pink stars to black stars. Once a player's points reach 20,000 the game automatically resets a player back down to zero. A variety of cheats have emerged on the game - players using internet anagram solvers etc, hackers creating new points - but invariably the game is played by the rules. The frustration of the players regarding the dictionary results in creative use of language since cussing is automatically censored in the forum.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
A few points</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-notable, there are thousands of internet games that use anagrams, this article is not intended to be a list of all of them, especially is this game is basically a copy of Countdown (which itself has been shown on British TV for 21 consecutive years). In fact this sounds like the same game as "anagramania".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Useless information such as 'variety of cheats and hackers' 'frustration of the players' 'creative use of language since cussing is automatically censored'</li>
</ul>
<p>Forgot the best one&#160;: "Players enthusiastically converse on the game's forum using a variety of graphics, mostly thanking each other for games but also complaining bitterly about the words which are rejected by the ruling dictionary".</p>
<ul>
<li>Under the same lines, we could put all the Scrabble variants like literati, clabbers, upwords and whatever in the article, but this article is not intended to be a definitive list of them.</li>
