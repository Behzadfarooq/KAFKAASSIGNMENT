<p>This article ignores his contributions to the formation of the Sinhalese Buddhist nationalism that lead to independence, as well as the ongoing problems on the island. I don't think that Dharmapala would want his work in this area to be ignored, I imagine he was rather proud of it. This material is easily available, I'll try to add something when I have time, but I might not get to it.</p>
<p><i>edit</i>: I added a brief section in this area. Someone could add some more if they wanted, just try to keep it NPOV. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoechip123_bd0c.html" title="User:Joechip123">Joechip123</a> 20:43, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Iwazaki: Don't go taking out parts that don't suit your ideology - I'm quoting one of the most reputable scholars on Sri Lanka in the world. My information is referenced. Saying that he promoted this ideology is a matter of public record. Do you want me to quote him directly? I can do that if you want me to.</p>
<p>Do you know what a POV article is? One that only tells the warm fuzzy parts about a controversial character. That's not the point of Wikipedia. Go start your own website for personal projects like that.</p>
<p>And finally, when you do a major edit like that, you need to provide a REALL good explanation in the talk page. --<a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoechip123_bd0c.html" title="User:Joechip123">Joechip123</a> 04:44, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am not sure what ideology you are talking about.What i removed is a POV fork ..I have studied about the life of Anagarika Dharmapala and I have a enormous respect to his ideology..SO if anything I was removing some misleading facts from this article. And I am not sure who thinks he is a controversial character&#160;? Just because Mr Devotta thinks he is controversial ,doesn't make him Controversial..Except for the LTTE sympathizers who like anything <b>BUT</b> Sinhalese, no one consider him as a controversial figure in my country. And regarding four points, I would appreciate it,if you can quote him directly about the second point.This gives an impression to the reader that he is a tamil hater when he was absolutely not..And please stick to the point next time, otherwise i am not going to entertain you here..Asking me start my own web site and bla bla, will certainly not going to help you.<a href="../../../i/w/a/User%7EIwazaki_0652.html" title="User:Iwazaki"><font color="blue"><b>Iwazaki</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/w/a/User_talk%7EIwazaki_7b86.html" title="User talk:Iwazaki"><font color="red">会話。討論</font></a></sup> 09:38, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your ideological bias is obvious in your comments here: "Except for the LTTE sympathizers who like anything <b>BUT</b> Sinhalese, no one consider him as a controversial figure in my country". Correct me if I am wrong, but this statement could be restated as "except for a sizable number of Tamils [i.e. LTTE sympathizers] in Sri Lanka, no one thinks he is controversial in my country". Well, guess what? That makes him a controversial character! If we can safely say that several hundred-thousand, if not several million Tamils don't think of his legacy as being so positive, then he is a controversial character.Furthermore, DeVotta is a widely respected scholar so it <b>does</b> matter what he thinks. If Wikipedia is going to start ignoring prominent scholars, then it might as well stop including references at all. However, to indulge you, I will put back my section, but reinforce it with direct quotes from Dharmapala himself. I hope that will satisfy you. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoechip123_bd0c.html" title="User:Joechip123">Joechip123</a> 18:49, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have inserted a direct quote from Anagarike Dharmapala himself from a book published by your Sinhalese government which was already cited in the references. I have also explained that he is controversial primarily in the Tamil community. I'm hoping that this should settle our argument. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoechip123_bd0c.html" title="User:Joechip123">Joechip123</a> 19:17, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're right, I should reference someone saying he is disliked by a significant number of Tamils. I'll put one in. The appropriate thing to do is not taking out the comment altogether, but asking me for a reference, which I am able to provide for you. The conflict in SL has two sides, and every article that involves it in any significant way should tell sides, with an explicit reference to their views as opinions, not empirical fact. That was what I was attempting to do by attributing that opinion to a portion of the Tamil population. It's not an allegation, but a statement of fact.</dd>
<dd>I have no personal involvement in the SL conflict. I am of European descent, from Canada, have never been to SL, and don't even know anyone from the country. My interest is purely scholarly. I have no score to settle here Iwazaki, I just want this article to tell both sides of the story. It is very clear from your comments that you have a great deal of personal involvement in the content of this article. You need to do some personal evaluation of your own biases and how they are driving your actions and comments. I'm not denying that I have a bias in the conflict, but you can't see it in my writing. You should do the same. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoechip123_bd0c.html" title="User:Joechip123">Joechip123</a> 17:57, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I've added a reference showing a Tamil perspective, as well as one presenting a Sinhalese one. Feel free to find better examples, or to fine tune the wording. I do feel that it is important to show both sides of the argument with controversial people. Maybe this requires a new section? I may put more in on his thought on war and so forth once I'm done my papers in a few weeks. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoechip123_bd0c.html" title="User:Joechip123">Joechip123</a> 00:10, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
