<p>Gilligan was educated at <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grey_Court_School_1eeb.html" title="Grey Court School">Grey Court School</a>, Ham, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richmond%2C_London_8a66.html" title="Richmond, London">Richmond</a> and at <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._John%27s_College%2C_Cambridge_23b8.html" title="St. John's College, Cambridge">St. John's College</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Cambridge_5f20.html" title="University of Cambridge">Cambridge University</a>, where he studied history. A large part of his time in Cambridge was spent on the student newspaper, <i><a href="../../../v/a/r/Varsity_%28Cambridge%29_e19a.html" title="Varsity (Cambridge)">Varsity</a></i>, of which he became News Editor. He was also a member of <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge_University_Labour_Club_ca55.html" title="Cambridge University Labour Club">Cambridge Organisation of Labour Students</a> and stood as one of its candidates for the Cambridge delegation to the National Union of Students conference in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>.</p>
<p>In 1994, after a summer placement on <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Independent_de8a.html" title="The Independent">The Independent</a></i>, he gave up his studies to work full-time in journalism. He contributed to the <i><a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge_Evening_News_a93c.html" title="Cambridge Evening News">Cambridge Evening News</a></i> as a freelance and later moved to the <i><a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunday_Telegraph_062c.html" title="Sunday Telegraph">Sunday Telegraph</a></i> where he became a specialist reporter on defence. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a> he was recruited by the <i>Today</i> programme editor <a href="../../../r/o/d/Rod_Liddle_64da.html" title="Rod Liddle">Rod Liddle</a> as Defence and Diplomatic Correspondent, as part of an attempt by Liddle to sharpen up the programme's investigative journalism.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Gilligan_471f.html" title="Edit section: The Today programme">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The <i>Today</i> programme</span></h2>
<p>On <i>Today</i>, Gilligan broke numerous stories about the British military's shortcomings, particularly in relation to the <a href="../../../k/o/s/Kosovo_war.html" title="Kosovo war">Kosovo war</a>. He obtained leaked <a href="../../../m/i/n/Ministry_of_Defence_%28United_Kingdom%29_f84c.html" title="Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)">Ministry of Defence</a> reports showing that the Army's rifles and radios had not worked; that only a small fraction of <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Air_Force_e156.html" title="Royal Air Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF) bombs during the campaign had hit their targets; and that a £1 billion upgrade to the RAF's main combat jet had left it unable to drop smart bombs. The <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secretary_of_State_for_Defence_17ac.html" title="Secretary of State for Defence">Defence Secretary</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoff_Hoon_5ab8.html" title="Geoff Hoon">Geoff Hoon</a>, denied to Parliament Gilligan's report that British troops were ill-equipped for the war in Iraq and called for a public apology. The story was borne out by a <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Audit_Office_%28United_Kingdom%29_1fcb.html" title="National Audit Office (United Kingdom)">National Audit Office</a> report.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>, Gilligan became the first British journalist to report on the EU's plans for a constitution. The Prime Minister's spokesman, <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alastair_Campbell_dc6b.html" title="Alastair Campbell">Alastair Campbell</a>, denied any such plans and attacked the journalist as 'Gullible Gilligan'.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>While most comment critical of Gilligan was directed at his having mistakenly reported his source as saying the 45 minute figure was wrong, Lord Hutton worded his conclusions as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The allegations reported by Mr Gilligan on the BBC Today programme on 29 May 2003 that the Government probably knew that the 45 minutes claim was wrong or questionable before the dossier was published and that it was not inserted in the first draft of the dossier because it only came from one source and the intelligence agencies did not really believe it was necessarily true, were unfounded.</i></dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Gilligan_471f.html" title="Edit section: Dr David Kelly">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Dr David Kelly</span></h2>
<p>Gilligan's source was one of the world's foremost biological weapons experts, Dr <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Kelly_57b7.html" title="David Kelly">David Kelly</a>. Kelly was found dead, apparently having committed suicide, shortly after being identified as the source for the story. An inquiry (the <a href="../../../h/u/t/Hutton_Inquiry_35cc.html" title="Hutton Inquiry">Hutton Inquiry</a>) subsequently set up to investigate the circumstances leading up to Kelly's death heard much evidence about Gilligan's claims, and ruled that they were unfounded. The Inquiry could not establish exactly what had transpired at the meeting between Gilligan and Kelly as Gilligan took notes using a <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handheld_PC_54da.html" title="Handheld PC">palmtop computer</a>. Two versions of the notes were found, only one of which mentioned Alastair Campbell.</p>
<p>However, Gilligan's account of the conversation was substantially corroborated by independent interviews given to other BBC journalists, <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susan_Watts_5c5e.html" title="Susan Watts">Susan Watts</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/v/Gavin_Hewitt_41e6.html" title="Gavin Hewitt">Gavin Hewitt</a>. Watts had recorded her conversation with Kelly, in which Kelly did indeed say that <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alastair_Campbell_dc6b.html" title="Alastair Campbell">Alastair Campbell</a> was responsible for changes to the dossier. (As both Gilligan and Watts had spoken to Dr Kelly on an <a href="../../../j/o/u/Journalism_sourcing.html" title="Journalism sourcing">unattributable</a> basis, he could have expected his anonymity to be protected.)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Gilligan_471f.html" title="Edit section: Political pressure">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Political pressure</span></h2>
<p>The Government began to demand that the BBC name the source for Gilligan's report. Gilligan and the BBC refused to do so. However, after rumours began to circulate amongst his colleagues, Kelly himself eventually revealed to his employers that he had spoken to Gilligan, though he denied making the more critical comments. As he was not a member of the Joint Intelligence Committee which had drawn up the dossier, and did not have any dealings with <a href="../../../1/0/_/10_Downing_Street_fec5.html" title="10 Downing Street">10 Downing Street</a>, Dr Kelly could not have known directly of any input of Alastair Campbell into the dossier and, for that reason, Campbell wanted Kelly's identity revealed in order to refute Gilligan's story.</p>
<p>It was later revealed that Campbell had written in his diary: "It was double-edged but GH (Geoff Hoon) and I agreed it would fuck Gilligan if that was his source." The name of David Kelly became known when several journalists picked up clues from a Government press release. Hutton later concluded that it was inevitable that Kelly's name would become public knowledge.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Gilligan_471f.html" title="Edit section: Inquiries">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Inquiries</span></h2>
<p>Several official enquiries into the affair were made, with different scopes.</p>
<p><a name="The_Foreign_Affairs_Committee" id="The_Foreign_Affairs_Committee"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Gilligan_471f.html" title="Edit section: The Foreign Affairs Committee">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Foreign Affairs Committee</span></h3>
<p>Kelly was called to give evidence before the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_Affairs_Committee_9939.html" title="Foreign Affairs Committee">Foreign Affairs Committee</a> of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_House_of_Commons_bbac.html" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a>, which was undertaking an inquiry into the dossier. Gilligan emailed several members of the Committee to tell them that Susan Watts' unattributed <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/Newsnight.html" title="Newsnight">Newsnight</a></i> source was David Kelly. Though it supported Gilligan's case, it unnerved Kelly — who was forced to deny making the comments which were quoted verbatim in the committee. Susan Watts' tape of the conversation would prove this a lie, placing Kelly in jeopardy. Gilligan's actions in identifying another journalist's source went against a principle of <a href="../../../i/n/v/Investigative_journalism.html" title="Investigative journalism">investigative journalism</a>: protect the source.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Gilligan_471f.html" title="Edit section: The Hutton Inquiry">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Hutton Inquiry</span></h3>
<p>Despite this error and the overstatement in the first report, Gilligan maintained he had uncovered a potentially important news story, originating from a credible source. However, his story suffered from weaknesses which were demonstrated during the inquiry. Lord Hutton ruled that while Alastair Campbell had made comments on the dossier, the <a href="../../../j/o/i/Joint_Intelligence_Committee_%28UK%29_ecf3.html" title="Joint Intelligence Committee (UK)">Joint Intelligence Committee</a> had taken all the decisions on its content. Hutton ruled that the Defence Intelligence Staff had raised doubts about the 45 minute claim, but they had been dismissed by the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secret_Intelligence_Service_e82b.html" title="Secret Intelligence Service">Secret Intelligence Service</a> and had not reached 10 Downing Street.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Gilligan_471f.html" title="Edit section: The Butler Enquiry">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Butler Enquiry</span></h3>
<p>A later official enquiry into the government's use of intelligence, conducted by the former head of the civil service <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Butler%2C_Baron_Butler_of_Brockwell_3e04.html" title="Robin Butler, Baron Butler of Brockwell">Lord Butler of Brockwell</a>, found that "more weight was placed on the intelligence than it would bear", that the dossier "put a strain on the Joint Intelligence Committee in seeking to maintain their normal standards of neutral and objective assessment", and that the judgments in the dossier went to the "outer limits … of the intelligence available."</p>
<p>On the 45-minute claim, Butler endorsed the concerns of the Defence Intelligence Staff and said they should have been heeded. The 45-minute claim should not have been included in the form it took, and there were "suspicions that it had been included because of its eye-catching character". It also emerged that some of the intelligence underpinning the dossier, based on reporting from a new and untested source, had been withdrawn by <a href="../../../m/i/6/MI6_da6b.html" title="MI6">MI6</a> as unreliable. Lord Butler of Brockwell revealed that much of the remainder of the intelligence was described by MI6 as "patchy" and "fragmentary", contrary to the characterisation of it by the Prime Minister as "detailed, authoritative and compelling". However, Lord Butler of Brockwell cleared both the Prime Minister and the chairman of the JIC, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Scarlett_7ece.html" title="John Scarlett">John Scarlett</a>, of bad faith or dishonesty.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Gilligan_471f.html" title="Edit section: Resignation from the BBC">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Resignation from the BBC</span></h2>
<p>During the Hutton Inquiry, Gilligan made little public comment on the affair, leaving that to more senior BBC personnel, including Director-General <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greg_Dyke_5eac.html" title="Greg Dyke">Greg Dyke</a> and chairman <a href="../../../g/a/v/Gavyn_Davies_ad9a.html" title="Gavyn Davies">Gavyn Davies</a> both of whom stood by Gilligan's story. All three resigned from the BBC following the publication of the Hutton Inquiry report. Gilligan was belligerent in his departure, saying: "This report casts a chill over all journalism, not just the BBC's. It seeks to hold reporters, with all the difficulties they face, to a standard that it does not appear to demand of, for instance, Government dossiers."</p>
<p>After leaving the BBC, Gilligan became Defence and Diplomatic Editor of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Spectator_0701.html" title="The Spectator">The Spectator</a></i>. As of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> he writes for the <i><a href="../../../e/v/e/Evening_Standard_7d40.html" title="Evening Standard">Evening Standard</a></i> on defence and diplomatic affairs and on other issues, including the paper's campaign to preserve the <a href="../../../r/o/u/Routemaster.html" title="Routemaster">Routemaster</a> <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> bus. Public transport has long been one of Gilligan's private interests. In a speech to the Edinburgh TV Festival in August 2004, the main annual gathering of the broadcasting industry, Gilligan spoke of his "awe" at the Government's "industrial-strength, 45-carat shamelessness" over the dossier and said that the BBC should not retreat from journalism probing of the Government.</p>
<p>In a drama-documentary <i>The Government Inspector</i> made by <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Kosminsky_1b10.html" title="Peter Kosminsky">Peter Kosminsky</a> and broadcast on March 17th 2005 by <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_4.html" title="Channel 4">Channel 4</a>, the discrepancy between the two computer versions of Gilligan's record of his meeting with Dr Kelly was explained by showing Gilligan altering the file to make it tie in with what he had reported. Gilligan described the depiction as "demonstrably, even absurdly, false", and his denial was supported by Greg Dyke. However, Kosminsky said that he had been advised by a computer forensics expert.</p>
<p>More recently, Gilligan began reporting for the London <i>Evening Standard</i>. He has also worked for Channel 4 on the investigative programme <i><a href="../../../d/i/s/Dispatches.html" title="Dispatches">Dispatches</a></i>, looking at the treatment of British soldiers returning from war in Iraq.</p>
