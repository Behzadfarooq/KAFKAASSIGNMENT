	    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I am a hobby historian with a strong interest in WW II eastern front and Normandy. I am sceptical about Wikipedia, but was convinced to give it a try, and I will see how it works out. I intend to participate in military history related projects on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I am also able to contribute to energy-related matters (see e.g. <a href="../../../m/i/c/MicroCHP_16cc.html" title="MicroCHP">MicroCHP</a>)</p>
<p>I live in Paris use Macs and have no cats.</p>

<p>Just as you like to use German name for "Armee" I use Roman Numerals for German units for the same reason. This is quite a common convention in English language books, eg look at this <a href="http://www.onwar.com/maps/wwii/eastfront2/1berlin45.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.onwar.com/maps/wwii/eastfront2/1berlin45.htm" rel="nofollow">map</a> This particualar map is taken from "Battle For Berlin: End Of The Third Reich" by Earl Ziemke --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 11:23, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ziemke in the narrative of his books does not do this though, but uses Arabic numerals instead. At least in the two main works 'Moscow to Stalingrad' and 'Stalingrad to Berlin'. From a personal impression view, using Roman numerals really seems very very wrong to me, and I think that in a text where both Armeekorps and Armeen are mentioned, it does not help much with distinguishing.
<dl>
<dd>He does throughout the text of his "Battle for Berlin" book, and as I said it is quite a common convention, but I would be the first to concede that it is only used in a minority of works.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But then again, I get upset if someone writes XLIX.Armeekorps instead of XXXXVIIII.Armeekorps (as the Wehrmacht did) too, so don't take me too serious. <a href="http://www.web40571.clarahost.co.uk/roman/howtheywork.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.web40571.clarahost.co.uk/roman/howtheywork.htm" rel="nofollow">How Roman Numerals Work - just found this nice site</a> <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreas1968_bd6b.html" title="User:Andreas1968">Andreas</a> 11:33, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was very glad when the the Year 2000 came as I can read the dates on BBC programmes without having to do mental gymnastics. There is one place were Roman Numeral do always differ from the norm which is the 4 on a clock face "IIII" to balance the 8 VIII.</p>

<p>Lets talk it through first on the Battle of Halbe, as I do not want to spend a long time explaining to people that this is not a change to the naming conventions of Armies, Corps and Divisions, but is a convenience for clarity of which side is being talked about in paragraphs of a page. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 13:01, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thank you for apologising, but I know that it is an easy mistake to make. I have made similar mistakes in the past.

No one is going to accept my test page the thing is it is almost the same as it was when i made it just a few houers before the page got locked and if they couldnt accept it then well there is no way they are going to accept it now. It is all a trick to start a new edit war. The page was made by me and has just slightly changed since i first made it so I doubt people actually want to see it they just want to have the page unlocked so that they can put all the source-less facts into just like last time.

<p>I know his work is regarded as the definitive version of the events and no doubt, the work is remarkable. But let us still point out that he does not explain some facts contradicting the Soviet defence theory:</p>
<p><i>In particular, the incredible Soviet strength set opposite Romania in 1941 dwarfed not only any Romanian but also any German potential on that front. Stalin could have created better units for defense. He was not deployed for defense, as the ensuing debacle, and inspection of unit types, shows. (...) Glantz does not explain what the 9th independent army (present on his OB in something approximating the condition Suvorov alleges) was doing down there, or why they were the only "independent" Soviet army. Suvorov asks where these soldiers, especially in their frontier concentrations, were going to stay for the winter, or even train further for soldiering. What were they going to eat?</i> Etc. This has been stated in a review of the book <a href="http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/genocide/reviewsw63.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/genocide/reviewsw63.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>And note, that Stumbling Colussus (unlike <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalin%27s_Missed_Chance_bc6b.html" title="Stalin's Missed Chance">Stalin's Missed Chance</a>) is not an original research work (I conclude from what I've read about it, the book has been inaccessible for me) as <i>most of [Glantz's] unique sources lie in "a category midway between what Westerners considered as primary and secondary source material," i.e. military journals, training materials and memoirs mostly published in periods of relative openness before or after Brezhnev (p.345). Most actual archives effectively remain closed. Thus (and Glantz does address this), this particular book is not a first-person archival exposition of the topic, but depends on works edited by Soviet officials.</i> (op cit)</p>
<p>So, 'white spots' remain, and actually only Russian archives and research on these materials can bring forth the truth. --Constanz - <a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConstanz_9594.html" title="User talk:Constanz">Talk</a> 10:11, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm afraid ordering mr Glantz from <a href="../../../e/s/t/Estonia.html" title="Estonia">Estonia</a> is not the easiest thing to do. I'd note that I'm not a military history fan myself and I've been dealing with Suvorov and Meltyukhov just for the sake of opening discussion on the issue. I'd note that may-be surprisingly for Western citizens, but the theory of Stalin's assault plans has been accepted by the professional historians in my country (as shows my compatriot Marko Mihkelson's review of Meltyukhov's book <a href="http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/4652.html##5" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/4652.html##5" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>)</p>

<p>Of the communists, yest indeed they are seen as puppet forces as they were appointed by SU and controlled Polish miltiary together with Soviet officers.Also they arrived in Poland only in 1944, before they lived in Soviet Union, with some of them fighting against Poland on the side of Bolsheviks in Polish-Bolshevik war.

<p>Hey Andreas, I noticed that you placed a tag on the 11th Soviet Red Army page as a stub for a World War II article. However, the 11th Army was involved in invading Caucaus during the Russian Revolution, not the second World War.

<p>Both officers were removed from command during Operation Bluecoat; however, you have reverted edits, with the comment that the reasons for their dismissal was not related to the operation.</p>
<p>From Chester Wilmot, <i>The Struggle for Europe</i>: "On the evening of August 1st ... neither 7th Armoured nor Fifty Div had made any appreciable progress towards their objectives, Aunay and Villers Bocage respectively. On the 2nd, after a stern warning from Dempsey to "get on or get out", Bucknall was dismissed and next day, when Aunay was still untaken, Erskine was removed from command of the Desert Rats."</p>
<p>It appears from this source, that "Bluecoat" must have provided at least part of the reason or pretext for the removal of these two officers. Can you give sources which give more complete details about these two command crises&#160;? <a href="../../../h/l/g/User%7EHLGallon_c6b0.html" title="User:HLGallon">HLGallon</a> 21:24, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Review by Thomas Titura (from Austria):</p>
<p>âWhen Roosevelt initiated the formal recognition of the Soviet Union, Stalin was already standing knee-deep in the blood of his opponents, both imagined and real. But that doesn't bother Mrs. Glantz. The only important thing is that Stalin was opposed to Hitler. <i>But stop! Stalin signed a pact and secret protocol with Hitler. Stalin also occupied Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania, Bessarabia and smashed the Polish forces fleeing from Hitler's Wehrmacht. No problem, Stalin was only expanding his defensive perimeter...</i></p>
<p><i>Stalin attacked another small neighbour, <b>Finland. Still, no problem for the author.</b></i> But there was one problem: the young State Department officials who later served at the American Embassy in Moscow sided with the Baltic States and Finland (as did the majority of the Western populations at the time).<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> Glantz naturally does not excuse such a wrong policy, one has to look at the big picture: Stalin will be important in the future, so let him conquer any country he likes. The occupation of other countries by Stalin is always a defensive measure. <i>Another issue: Mrs. Glantz writes about the NKVD terror in the occupied countries and in the Soviet Union itself. Does she call it terror, because sheer terror is what is was? No, she mostly refers to it as "NKVD action".</i><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Duranty_2006.html" title="Walter Duranty">Walter Duranty</a> would be proud of her.â</p>
<p>Moreover: âCan you believe it: Glantz really thinks that first class and unbiased information about the Red Army should be extracted from the heavily censored Soviet press under Stalin's rule! What an insane argument.In Glantz's view, the US had absolutely no right, to demand any kind of reciprocity for the massive aid it granted Stalin via lend-lease. [...] Not surprisingly, Glantz completely omits the large scale Soviet espionage effort against the US that already stared before the war. â <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/070061365X/ref=sr_11_1/104-0754874-0208706?ie=UTF8" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/070061365X/ref=sr_11_1/104-0754874-0208706?ie=UTF8" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>
