<p>Well, one thing that the MoS says (unless it's been changed in the last week or so) is that primary links shouldn't be piped, and that other links shouldn't be used; when I saw that you'd piped the primary links and added secondary ones (and changed "is" to the generally deprecated "may refer to", I reverted. It's true that I didn't notice that you'd moved <a href="../../../i/n/n/Innuendo_%28Malaysia%29_d82d.html" title="Innuendo (Malaysia)">Innuendo (Malaysia)</a> to <a href="../../../i/n/n/Innuendo_%28band%29.html" title="Innuendo (band)">Innuendo (band)</a> â€” but then you'd only just done that, and the links had all worked fine when I'd created the page a month before. Still, I'm glad that it's worked out now.</p>

<p>At <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_%28TV_series%29_c407.html" title="Lost (TV series)">Lost (TV series)</a>, you reverted my revert of possible vandalism saying that "it was wrong". I realise we have the assume good faith policy, but are you sure this information is accurate? I took time out to search for "Skyplanet 5" and I haven't found anything. Google shows no results for a direct search and a bunch of garbage for "Skyplanet" or "Sky planet". I tried to whittle the results down by adding "Lebanon", but I didn't find anything. Now add on the fact that the next edit by this user was complete vandalism -- "Dinesh Van Den Berg as Retarded comic artist who rips off LOTR (Season 8)"?</p>

<dd>Hi Andylkl, you wrote: "<i>Both spellings are widely used, I know. But it seems that George Town is preferred in authorative sources such as atlases and Encarta. Even the local municipal council uses both. I guess it's accepted as an alternative spelling, but the George Town article remains at its current title and that should also be reflected in any other links that link to it.</i>"</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Seems like a departure from your earlier contention that "<b>I'm pretty much sure that the capital of Penang is spelled George Town</b> rather than Georgetown."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It has been a waste of my time to reply. Who is Encarta and all the other publishers of atlases anyway? Is Encarta infalliable, or does it have a sacrosanct right to change someone's name merely because it is a reputable company? If Encarta is more authoritative than the Government of Penang, its Tourist Information Centre, the Mahkamah Persekutuan Malaysia, Jabatan Peguam Negara Malaysia, BERNAMA (Malaysia's Official News Agency) and even the Yellow Pages, then let's follow Encarta.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You talk as if the title of an article is sacred and cannot be changed, and that there are no mechanisms in Wikipedia to "reflect it in any other links that link to it". I reserve my comments.</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndylkl_Archive_02_7d0f.html" title="Edit section: Penang Map">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Penang Map</span></h2>
<p>Hi Andylkl, your points raised in regards to the Penang map are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Maps need to be consistent with other articles on Malaysian states.</li>
<li>The current map isn't really informative.</li>
<li>The map doesn't have copyright info.</li>
<li>Deletion of links to images that have proper copyright info for use on Wikipedia may be considered to be edits made in bad faith.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of the four points raised, the first point is very strong and valid. Honestly, I was not aware of the other State articles, and therefore did not see the big picture. In isolation, the map for the State of Penang seems odd as it is too near the edge. To me, it only make sense when viewed as a whole in relation to the other State articles.</p>
<p>I have since revert the map, and that should settle the matter. In any case, since you brought it up, I might as well share my views on the other points.</p>

<p>Whether the map is informative or not is subjective and depends on the context. This particular map shows Penang in relation to South East Asia and not just to Malaysia. Thus, while your map is very meaningful to Malaysians, it may not be so for those who do not know where Malaysia is, but are aware of where South East Asia is. Again, my map will not be meaningful to those who do not know where South East Asia is. Thus, your remark is quite self-opinionated.</p>

<p>As a statement of fact, your statement is indisputable. But I did leave a <a href="http://www.investpenang.gov.my/penang_map.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.investpenang.gov.my/penang_map.htm" rel="nofollow">link</a> there, and while this used to be acceptable, I believe Wikipedia is thinking of changing its policy, perhaps due to recent developments in Google. I do hope that the people in charge of Wikipedia are not going to get intimidated and swing to the other extreme. In any case, Google is putting up a fight, and this should be the attitude of all progressive companies who believe in what they do, and are prepared to take calculated risks to explore new territories. Leaders come in many shapes. Some are aggressive and grow the company, while others play it safe, with safe consequences.</p>
<p>Copyrights, in practice as opposed to in law, are very complicated matters, involving both legal and non-legal issues. In the final analysis, the question is not whether one has infringed a copyright, but whether he will be sued for it. This is the pragmatist view, although purists and moralists will not agree.</p>
<p>I was involved in a copyright case in one of the companies that I worked for, and learned quite a bit therefrom. There is no hard and fast rule in practice, but when it comes to the strict interpretation of the law, of course there is but one answer: either there is an infringement or there is not. Yet the mind of senior management people are so different from that of, say, an executive or a clerk, who merely follow instructions and follow the law to the letter. Advances in all fields of endeavor are never made by following rules diligently, but by breaking them creatively.</p>
<p>The map that I had used was taken from investPenang, a website by the Penang government promoting the state to investors. I do not believe that it would sue for its use. On the contrary, it would be all too happy to say "yes", if only I were to ask, for the simple reason that their exposure is increased thereby, more so when Wikipedia is a creditable website. Even so, I must admit that they can sue if they want to, that is if they were to follow the law to the letter. For me to ask for copyright is simply not practical, as you know how government does things. It may take months, and they may not even reply. Moreover, I am not so hardworking, and if anyone should feel that it is inappropriate to include the map, please feel free to take it off.</p>
<p>Admittedly, Wikipedia would have been taken off long ago if anyone had taken legal action against them. The number of wholesale "cut and paste" articles are indeed appalling, but the very fact that no one has sued seems to tell its own story. It would take another long discourse to discuss this matter. My philosophy is: "To avoid car accidents, never be on the road. To avoid being an air crash victim, never ever fly in an aeroplane". In short, be pragmatic.</p>

<p>Your contention is that deletion of links to images that have proper copyright info is bad. What if I put in an image taken by myself which is badly done, although the copyright is proper? My point is that this point seems moot.</p>
<p>In any case, all my edits are made in good faith. Should anyone feel that my edits are bad, I do not give two hoots if they remove it... and that's to put it very bluntly, although I should tone it down, LOL.

<p>Hi Andylkl, you mentioned that my edits "may be misinterpreted as being "bad faith", "vandalism" and et cetera by others, since deletion without reason does give the impression of bad faith edits."</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">"Principles of Wikipedia etiquette"</a> states:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<b>To assume good faith is a fundamental principle on any wiki, including Wikipedia</b>. As we allow anyone to edit, it follows that we assume that most people who work on the project are trying to help it, not hurt it. <b>If this weren't true, a project like Wikipedia would be doomed from the beginning</b>.... So, when you can reasonably assume that something is a well-intentioned error, correct it without just reverting it or <b>labeling it as vandalism</b>."</dd>
</dl>
<p><a href="../../../o/w/n/Wikipedia%7EOwnership_of_articles_36eb.html#Control_of_Wikipedia_articles" title="Wikipedia:Ownership of articles">Wikipedia further states</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<b>If you do not want your writing to be edited mercilessly</b> and redistributed at will, <b>then do not submit it</b>."</dd>
</dl>
<p>I have no control over how anyone would like to think. Moreover, if they think thus, they shouldn't be in Wikipedia at all, as is evident from the above quotes.</p>
<p>As to the "deletion" of the topographical map, it is my personal opinion while editing that the trade-off between information provided and space utilisation is not justified. Since you have mentioned about it, I measured it and found that 40% of space utilized does not provide any information. I further feel that topographical maps are not particularly useful in this kind of articles.</p>
<p>As regards the sunset scene, the proportion of the photograph seems rather odd. In any case, it did not provide any useful information, as one can also claim it to be any other island.</p>
<p>Of course, all these are personal opinions and judgement that I used in making my edit. Had I wanted to vandalize this article, I would have kept those that I have deleted and instead, delete the photograph on the "view of Georgetown"!!!</p>
<p>In any case, the pictures were never deleted. It's still in Wikipedia!!! â€” <a href="../../../p/m/_/User%7EPM_Poon_6c1e.html" title="User:PM Poon">PM Poon</a> 23:59, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndylkl_Archive_02_7d0f.html" title="Edit section: Invitation to copyright debate">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Invitation to copyright debate</span></h2>
<p>Hi Andylkl, thank you very much for your invitation to participate in the ongoing debate on copyright. I must regret to decline for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have participated in forums and found that any <b>debate where there are no judges is always futile</b>. Each side clings on to its views, and almost invariably, the debate deteriorates into personality attacks.</li>
<li><b>Copyright laws vary from country to country</b>, and in order to be safe for a cross-border media, one has to take the country with the tightest regulations â€” with dire consequences.</li>
<li>Even within the same country, <b>experts' opinions differ</b>. No two judges may agree with each other, as I have found to my amazement (and amusement)! All one has to do is to look at the number of High Court decisions overturned by a superior court on appeal.</li>
<li>All these aside, I must admit that I am not only plain lazy, but honestly, <b>I am very selfish</b> too. I am no Mother Theresa. Should I ever be invited to be an admin, I would definitely decline as I can't do justice to the position. I contribute only because I enjoy writing, and in the process, if Wikipedia benefits from my contribution, it is merely coincidental, LOL. You can thus understand why I do not really care what happens to my article after I have contributed or edited. To be sure, everyone has different ideas and ways of writing. The only thing I will want to know, however, is when someone tags my article as "NPOV" or "copyedit". The reason why I want to know is merely because I want to improve myself and avoid the same mistake.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike popular perception, I found out that law is actually a very dynamic thing, with many grey areas that an intelligent lawyer can work on. And in many cases, the cost of pursuing an action outweighs the benefits... as in Wikipedia, where no money can be obtained, except for (court) costs. A wrong can become "right" under certain circumstances. Reader Digest, for example, has a feature article where they typically summarize new publications without asking for permission, and reportedly forward a cheque for USD$500 to the copyright holder. I understand that this is actually an infringement in law, but so far, everyone seems to be happy.</p>
<p>It is my personal opinion that instead of merely complying with copyright, Wikipedia, as a non-commercial organization, should look into ways to immune itself from copyright actions. This may be done by positioning itself in the market as THE website, such that not only will no one ever think of suing it, they will be too glad to have their articles included in it, with a link to their webpage.</p>
<p>(P/S: Honestly, I am very addicted to Wikipedia, but with all the controversies, I have planned to get out if I can, LOL.) â€” <a href="../../../p/m/_/User%7EPM_Poon_6c1e.html" title="User:PM Poon">PM Poon</a> 01:04, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>In subsequent months, please avoid making more then one edit to the current month's page (ie. "Novemember 2004 in M and S" other then creating a redirect to the current page "Current events in M and S". I will now have to ask an admin to do the move for us. Arrggggghhh!!!!&#160;:D</p>

<p>Hi Andy,</p>
<p>I just wanted to thank you for supporting me in <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Deathphoenix_1b17.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Deathphoenix">my RfA</a>. To tell you the truth, I was surprised by all the support I've gotten. I never saw myself as more than an occasional Wiki-hobbyist.</p>
<p>My wife sends her curses, as Wikipedia will likely suck up more of my time. She jokingly (I think) said she was tempted to log on to Wikipedia just to vote Oppose and let everyone know that she didn't want her husband to be an admin.</p>
<p>I'll make sure your trust in me is founded. I'll wield the mop and bucket with pride! --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><b>e</b></a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">ath</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 15:14, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, thank you for the support, but could you tell me how you edited the article. I just found out about this article on December 8 and then Piecraft left soon after. Since then, people threatened to delete it because there was no proof on it. So, I had to remove things in order to stop the threats. 12/30 r430nb</p>

<p>I see you tried to add an "other_languages" field to this infobox. Please don't do that. It was decided a long time ago that general language usage should be in the article, since that information can overwhelm the small infobox. It's also cause edit wars on many country pages. Because of that, it is best that the infobox should only show the official language(s) used by the government. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 17:36, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for letting me know about this, though is it alright if a slightly adjusted template be used for a country? The only reason that I tried to add another section to the infobox was that there's currently a content dispute in the Malaysia article, and the extra section is sort of a compromise on my part, since we occasionally get other editors adding extra languages to the official language section when actually there's only one, might as well list it up under "other languages". Seems useful in this case though.&#160;:) Regards, Andylkl [ talk! | c ] 18:36, 2 January 2006 (UTC) <i>(Note: Reply left on <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">user's talk page</a>.)</i>

<dd>I recommend strongly that you hold to using the standard infobox, it is designed to be consistent across all the articles. Non-official languages should be dealt with in the article, not the infobox. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 18:54, 2 January 2006 (UTC)
