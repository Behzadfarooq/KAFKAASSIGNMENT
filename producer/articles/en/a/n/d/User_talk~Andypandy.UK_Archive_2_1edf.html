<p>Possibly you'd look less like "oh no, badword, badword" if you bothered to read the whole discussion instead of just noticing my suggestion to him to get a brain? He was (clearly) trolling since his second comment. And really, if you can't spot where he was trolling, you might want to leave such "let's all behave" comments unsaid. I'm assuming good faith, but certainly not enough time spent trying to analyze the situation. Taza insane 14:05, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I noticed that you asked this person to calm down regarding their blatantly inflamatory comments on the <a href="../../../n/e/v/Talk%7ENeverwinter_Nights_7921.html" title="Talk:Neverwinter Nights">Talk:Neverwinter Nights</a> page. I have to admit that they definately got under my skin, and when they started calling me a troll (strange considering they were the one who came into a conversation, accused me of being ignorant and then failed to support the statement) I should have stopped responding. I have now refrained from talking to this person, clearly they have no intention of contributing or being contructive at all. I dont assume that I am perfect, or that my knowledge is complete... but at the very least I would have expected such claims of lacking knowledge to be substanciated with fact. Now they are claiming knowledge of my banning from the Bioware forums (which was due to my "tone", not for trolling).... the urge to respond is great, but I see no point so will leave it alone. <a href="../../../e/n/i/User%7EEnigmatical_a9c5.html" title="User:Enigmatical">Enigmatical</a> 05:39, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey -- sorry I let that message get by me before. In response, no I think AfD is a bad idea. The phenomenon of a shock site is documented enough to be a reasonable encyclopedia topic, and there have been four AfD's on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_shock_sites.html" title="List of shock sites">List of shock sites</a> before it was merged to <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shock_site.html" title="Shock site">Shock site</a> that you should look over; see <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_shock_sites_5251.html" title="Talk:List of shock sites">Talk:List of shock sites</a> for the links. They were bitter battles that amounted to nothing useful... and the article is in better shape now than it was during those debates. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 23:40, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Let me expand on that. I think the article could be edited some more (I for one am well aware that it's got a long way to go before it becomes a good article), but deletion would be bad. We used to have people posting articles on every shock site on the 'net, but now they focus on the one article. The article is more compliant with respect to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> than it used to be. Notability of individual sites may be a concern, but if we're requiring a reliable source for each one, that's a standard of notability as well; see the discussion on <a href="../../../m/e/m/WP%7EMEME_0b58.html" title="WP:MEME">WP:MEME</a>... basically, memes (and shock sites are a type of meme) being notable is almost irrelevant next to them being verifiable. You're right that the page is a troll magnet. The problem is, it's better to keep a troll magnet around than to just let the trolls go wherever they want. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 04:40, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My dear Andy, I simply wanted to thank you for your kind words on my talk page - and to tell you that your first judgement was correct, I am not an admin!&#160;;) Your most generous offer to nominate me is also much apreciatted, as I have seen your opinions at RfA and you strike me as both a thoughtful and a demanding editor, who wishes top-notch quality in a candidate before lending his support. But, just to let you know, hun - <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Phaedriel_931b.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Phaedriel">I've declined</a> a nomination just today, for the motives I express there. I may choose to go for it in a few days, but my real life goes first; and I need to wait for a while before considering the idea. This being said, I am very glad that you decided to approach me with your kind offer. It means so much to me, that I care little about adminship - being gifted the beautiful gesture you've given me today is a treasure in itself.

<dd>Well I was going to ask you how long you thought it would be before you'd be ready for a RFA (I'm getting fed up of seeing you posting to AIV without being able to actually do any blocking&#160;;). I know you said not that long ago in an oppose for another RFA that you didn't think you'd be ready, so I was curious as to how long you thought it would be till you would be. As having email enabled is a requirement for being an admin, I was checking. Even as a non-admin sometimes people want to contact you about stuff privately. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetros471_bbc1.html" title="User:Petros471">Petros471</a> 20:25, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ok. No, your email is only shown when you email others (i.e. if you sent someone an email from Wikipedia, or if you reply to an email sent to you through Wikipedia.) It's hidden from public view by a webform (just click on my email link to see what it looks like.) That gives you the option to ignore any spam (I've not received any yet) and/or hate mail (yep, had some of that!) without revealing your address. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetros471_bbc1.html" title="User:Petros471">Petros471</a> 20:46, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Nothing I guess. As I said though, I've never received any actual spam (only the odd nasty one from someone I've threatened to block, but those are the minority, most are "why did you delete x" or "please unblock y" type). If it does become a problem you can always use your email client/provider to block a particular email address and/or set up a filter for the username (it's tagged with the address). <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetros471_bbc1.html" title="User:Petros471">Petros471</a> 20:55, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Aye, obviously check the contribs. Hopefully the block log will say who the user is a suspected sock of (so you can compare), if not like you say check the blocking admin's contribs/block log at around the same time to see. I ask that one because I have had a few people email me for real with similar situation. Obviously common sense is needed when deciding what to do... It is quite common in situations when a batch of socks are being blocked at once for an innocent new account to be blocked at the same time by mistake along with the load of real socks. I've made that mistake myself (AFAIK only once!), so it does crop up. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetros471_bbc1.html" title="User:Petros471">Petros471</a> 21:19, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeh, correct enough. When I ask those sort of things I'm not looking for a 'model answer', just that you've got a bit of sense and don't say anything too stupid. You didn't! You're probably right, which is why the couple I've received are probably legitimate (i.e. mistakenly blocked people). One of them turned out to be a uni prof who then did a few minor (but good) edits to maths articles. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetros471_bbc1.html" title="User:Petros471">Petros471</a> 21:29, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>According to <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a></p>
<p><i>Wikipedia is not a web directory; no page should consist solely of a collection of external links. Wikipedia always prefers internal links over external links. However, adding a certain number of relevant external links is of valuable service to our readers.</i></p>
<p>None of this applies to <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheating_in_Counter-Strike_d6ff.html" title="Cheating in Counter-Strike">Cheating in Counter-Strike</a> even remotely. The article is &gt;60 kb and you'd need hundreds of external links to get even close to "dwarfing" the actual article.</p>
<p>Don't get Wikilaywering on me. I've worked on this Article a lot longer than you. This particular link has been added a couple times already by various people. (As such it had to be removed occasionally because it was found to be linked several times) You're just fighting windmills there.</p>
<p>External sources are important in order to verify information given in an article, per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. As such it does not matter whether it is a commercial link or not - Being able to verify does not mean being able to do so for free. In addition, the article hints that there is a commercial aspect at cheating, and this particular, "commercial" link only illustrates that. As such, it is important to link to the site for the integrity of the article.</p>
<p>To sum it up: Just leave it in. There's other things that need more attention than stupid cheatsite links. 84.75.130.173 18:33, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That article looks pretty bad for link spam, so you're quite right to try and clear some out. Sometimes it's easier to clear the lot and just add a couple of links to a directory (like dmoz) and any official sites. What particular link is the dispute over- your latest revert covered a few? <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetros471_bbc1.html" title="User:Petros471">Petros471</a> 21:51, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>Spamming EL-wise would mean it is linked purely as an advertisement in an otherwise unrelated article <a href="http://www.buyviagra.com" class="external text" title="http://www.buyviagra.com" rel="nofollow">BUY V1AGR4!</a>. Spamming contentwise would mean the article itself serves as an advertisement. V1AGR4 IS GREAT! Neither is the case. It is, just like all others, a valid and valuable external link. It has been added several times by several people in a good faith attempt to increase the number of quality external links in the article, and there is absolutely no excuse for removing it. Remember, removal of content for no reason is Vandalism. Before I move around and remove "commercial links" from all articles in Wikipedia in a pure and blatant violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> tell me one good reason why this link should not be there. 84.75.130.173 01:12, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Listen to people who know better than you: Revert your changes. People add these links because that is how a wiki works: If something's missing, it's added. If something's wrong, it's changed. Moving around and removing content that you - for some reason - do not like is not the way things are done. The whole thing has a history that you know nothing about, and the decision to allow inclusion of links such as the one you removed has been agreed on by everyone who has worked on the article for any longer amount of time. What you do is you chose to vandalize an Article, without bothering to look up the talk pages, to seek contact or to see if there has been any special argument regarding the changes that you want to make. That is NOT the right course of action. 84.75.130.173 06:39, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>See, you give away that you oppose the inclusion of cheat sites in Wikipedia, not this particular link. I originally was also very sceptical about this. But eventually it comes down to <b><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_censored" title="WP:NOT">WIKIPEDIA IS NOT CENSORED</a></b>. <i>Ahem</i>. As I pointed out, if you had cared to read the talk page, you would know about the more detailed ramifications of this non-issue. If you require further assistance with this particular issue/application of policy, may I forward you to Talk:Cheating_in_Counter-Strike where you are invited to question my reasoning - I should be able to answer briefly and clearly now, providing a sum-up of the situation on the talk page may help prevent future misunderstandings of this nature. 84.75.130.173 09:16, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

But the article to which you have just added a ship-stub, Ajax class battleships, I was actually in process of typing when you stuck the stub tag on.

If you call up the article "List of battleships of the Royal Navy" and select part three "Steam-powered ironclad battleships 1860-1905" you will see that from <i>Warrior</i> to <i>Ajax</i> there are articles. Most of them are written by me. Hence my excitement at your intervention.

<dd>I really don't know if I believe it or not. There is evidence both ways. Looks like Where has blocked that user though, and an IP troll has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:HolyRomanEmperor&amp;diff=61920671&amp;oldid=61920103" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:HolyRomanEmperor&amp;diff=61920671&amp;oldid=61920103" rel="nofollow">appeared</a>.

<dd>Yeh, don't feel bad about it. I think the talk is mostly along the lines of wait and see if HRE returns to editing or not. If it is a troll 'joke' then I think HRE is going to be *very* careful about his password in future (as we should all be!) If it is true then obviously it's very sad. I think it is quite possible that a user might request a note about their imminent death be posted, but yeh going around lots of talk pages I'm not sure... <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetros471_bbc1.html" title="User:Petros471">Petros471</a> 22:45, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I understand where you're coming from with the warning on my talk page, but in my defense that dude repeatedly wrote "SatanisGod" on the page that encouraged me to do that. I will admit to feeding trolls, but not to biting newbies. Still, you are right, I should avoid corrupting wikipedia. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7EReverendG_f606.html" title="User:ReverendG">ReverendG</a> 23:45, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dude, I apologized, quit with the lectures. Perhaps there should be a rule about biting semi-newbies, as seems to be your fancy. I agreed that wikipedia policy is important, as you will find as you look at my previous comment. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7EReverendG_f606.html" title="User:ReverendG">ReverendG</a> 06:34, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Spam Control</span></h2>
<p>Hi, you left a comment on my board about making sure I read the rules of "removing External Links and Spam Control"</p>
<p>Just to let you know, Ive read all the WP sites here, and I am also an active member in Spam Control along with all the various other projects that WP needs. My page may not be all descriptive and fancy like many on here, but I certainly dont just go to a page and rip it to pieces for the hell of it. I am sure the two of us have very different visions when it comes to editing and I never remove external links unless they don't belong on a page. WP is not a Yahoo Open Directory, and part of what makes WP is being accountable for everything on an article, including what it links to. And sad to say, most of the external links people put on the articles just do not belong. --<a href="../../../o/w/n/User%7EOwnlyanangel_bfd2.html" title="User:Ownlyanangel">Ownlyanangel</a> 09:18, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Spam Control....useless links</span></h2>
<p>Fine, we disagree. I will just let you attack some other person who looks at your site....and if you dont think your links dont have spam in them, then bring it up with Wikipedia because youre site is on the list. Spam doesnt always mean what you think, it also denotes useless links....such as WEB DIRECTORIES. The fact that your page has 2 directores is just preposterous...especially when, if you read WP, the rules are clear that this isnt a web directory. So if you would just remove those 2 open directory links, the spam tag will permanently leave your page....thats all Im asking, than I can move on and you can move on.--<a href="../../../o/w/n/User%7EOwnlyanangel_bfd2.html" title="User:Ownlyanangel">Ownlyanangel</a> 07:40, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">again...</span></h2>
<p>Im not attacking you at all. Im just saying that you are skipping around the subject entirely. The 2 links that were so carefully chosen do not belong on the site. They are open directory sites, thats not what Wikipedia is about. If you dont believe me, look up the info on WP: SM, and you will see that there is a subsection about directories and how WP is not a link farm. Why would your site be listed as a spam site if it didnt have a site or two that didt belong? --<a href="../../../o/w/n/User%7EOwnlyanangel_bfd2.html" title="User:Ownlyanangel">Ownlyanangel</a> 07:52, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
