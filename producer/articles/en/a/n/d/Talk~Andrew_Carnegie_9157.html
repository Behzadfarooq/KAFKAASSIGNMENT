<p>Did Carnegie invent a new process for manufacturing steel? This article is certainly far shorter than it ought eventually to become. -- Mike Hardy</p>
<p>Also, as of 2-12-07, the first External link, [<a href="http://www.primebiography.com/content.asp?ContentId=570" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.primebiography.com/content.asp?ContentId=570" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>] , has no relevance to Carnegie, nor does anything on that site. Instead, the link goes to a biography on "Bernard Arnault" , CEO of Moét Hennessy Louis Vuitton.</p>

<p>Changed a sentenced that said slavery was referred to as "the peculiar institution" as a euphemism from its apologists. It was actually a neutral term, and "peculiar" was used in the sense that it was only common in one particular region of the United States, namely the South.</p>

<p>I'm new to Wikipedia and I know I should just add to this entry, and maybe someday I will. In the meantime, here are a few other Carnegie philanthropies in the U.S. that deserve mention:</p>
<ul>
<li>Carnegie Corporation of New York</li>
<li>Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching</li>
<li>Carnegie Endowment for International Peace</li>
</ul>
<p>There's a good list here: <a href="http://www.carnegie.org/sub/links/other.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.carnegie.org/sub/links/other.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>

Many of today's private secular colleges/universities dropped their religious affiliations in the early 1900's. I remember reading somewhere this was because Carnegie stipulated secular conditions before he would help support a school. Does anyone know if this is correct? I can't find anything on google.</p>
<p><br />
The amounts given for his share of the US Steel buyout and for his total philanthropic efforts don't add up. According to the article, the total alue of the US Steel buyout was US$ 480 million, which it says equates to US$ 120 billion today. Then at the end of the Philanthropist section it says that he gave away roughly US$ 350 million which was equated to $4.3 billion today.</p>
<p>I checked the historical rates at measuringworth.com and it looks like the second number was derived from the change in the CPI from 1919 to 2005. If that's the conversion used, then the first number should equate US$ 480 million to US$ 11.4 billion in 2005.</p>
<p>Clearly there was some significant inflation between 1901 and 1919, but not enough to cause the change seen in the article. I don't know the source for the first conversion, but they need to use the same method for both conversions. Historical purchasing power conversions can produce very different results depending on the method used. Radial 16:18, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just reverted a change that suggested that Carnegie wanted to give all his money away rather than die "disgraced". I thought that the change was somewhat spurious and without substance. So, if he was "disgraced", then what was he "disgraced" about? --<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Angus_Mackay_d3da.html" title="User:Colin Angus Mackay">Colin Angus Mackay</a> 23:27, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Response,</p>
<p>Andrew Carnegie once wrote that "The man who dies thus rich, dies disgraced." He sincerly believed that dying with money was a waste, and that it was disgraceful to waste capital.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Also:</p>
<p>It seems odd that theories of monpolization or industrial integration don't appear in this article. Do we have a problem with point of view? Whether you think his business practices were good or not, it's important that this article has fair coverage from both perspectives on this man.</p>

<p>Will people please stop changing immigrate to emmigrate and back again.

<dd>Sorry to be a narc, but <b>emigrate</b> has only one "m", while <b>immigrate</b> has two. I don't know which dictionary you used, but "emmigrate" (2 ms) is in none of the ones I have looked in.

<dd><i>He</i> [American historian David Nasaw] <i>has unearthed numerous documents that previous biographers had no access to or didn’t find, including a prenuptial agreement signed by Carnegie and his wife Louise Whitfield in April 1887 – which according to the historian is one of the first prenuptial documents ever made – and an 1885 letter the philanthropist wrote to British Prime Minister William Gladstone.</i></dd>

<dd>As an American, Pittsburgher, and student at Carnegie Mellon University.... There is no consensus, but most locals say Car-neggy. And this absolutely does not belong in the Trivia section. It belongs next to his name at the beginning, or not at all, and it belongs in IPA. It also belongs wherever it goes along with a citation. The present blurb in the trivia section is utterly unsupported, and very few of the people around here say that. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreyscale_5a16.html" title="User:Greyscale">Greyscale</a> 11:04, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Response: He had help in investing his money from his mentor at the pennsylvanian railroad company, Thomas A. Scott. His mother gave her house as an security, and he was able to invest $500 very profitable in a firm called Adams Express in 1855. Later he reinvested his money in sleeping wagons for the prc and bought part of the company making the wagons, which turned out again a very profitable investment. This money was used then to invest in iron and bridge companies, and finally he founded companies for making railwaybridges, rails and locomotives.Joost 99 10:51, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Along with the <a href="../../../i/p/a/IPA_c3f8.html" title="IPA">IPA</a> coding, the phonetic quotes are shown as more likely to be understood by many people. Similar to <a href="../../../b/n/f/BNF_0890.html" title="BNF">BNF</a> coding in computer work, the IPA codes are too <a href="../../../e/s/o/Esoteric.html" title="Esoteric">esoteric</a>/<a href="../../../a/r/c/Arcane.html" title="Arcane">arcane</a> and <a href="../../../a/b/s/Abstract.html" title="Abstract">abstract</a> for "normal people" although IPA is great for formally defining subtle spoken variations.</dd>
<dd>Being an issue of American sophistication, pronunciations are typically addressed discretely, in a private conversation. In American "polite" society, a misspoken word would be politely ignored, then explained afterward, in private. In American writing, littering text with pronunciations is a potential insult to the intelligence of the reader, so the detailed pronunciation-footnote is a happy medium to handle a range of novices, amateurs, and sophisticates. Plus, a footnote has space to address a range of pronunciations, which is even beyond the scope of a typical dictionary entry limited to a small phrase about pronouncing a word. Although appearing as a trivial concept, footnotes are excellent text-technology, analogous to a <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subroutine.html" title="Subroutine">subroutine</a> in <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_programming.html" title="Computer programming">computer programming</a> (but that's another subject). In general, footnotes can store statements typically piled into a Trivia section, and tie each "trivial" statement into one (or more) related parts of the overall article.
