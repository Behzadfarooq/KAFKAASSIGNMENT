<p><b>Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun</b> (<a href="../../../1/6/5/1653.html" title="1653">1653</a> - September <a href="../../../1/7/1/1716.html" title="1716">1716</a>) was a <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scottish</a> writer, politician and <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_patriot.html" title="Scottish patriot">patriot</a>. He was a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commissioner.html" title="Commissioner">Commissioner</a> of the old <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_of_Scotland_b6d1.html" title="Parliament of Scotland">Parliament of Scotland</a> and opposed the <a href="../../../1/7/0/1707.html" title="1707">1707</a> <a href="../../../a/c/t/Act_of_Union_0d44.html" title="Act of Union">Act of Union</a> between <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> and <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>.</p>
<p>He was the son and heir of Sir Robert Fletcher (<a href="../../../1/6/2/1625.html" title="1625">1625</a>-<a href="../../../1/6/6/1664.html" title="1664">1664</a>), and was born at <a href="../../../s/a/l/Saltoun.html" title="Saltoun">Saltoun</a> in <a href="../../../h/a/d/Haddingtonshire.html" title="Haddingtonshire">Haddingtonshire</a>. Educated by <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilbert_Burnet_84c8.html" title="Gilbert Burnet">Gilbert Burnet</a>, the future <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_of_Salisbury_11de.html" title="Bishop of Salisbury">Bishop of Salisbury</a>, who was then <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minister_%28religion%29.html" title="Minister (religion)">minister</a> at Saltoun, he completed his education in <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mainland_Europe_ae68.html" title="Mainland Europe">mainland Europe</a>. Fletcher was elected, as the Commissioner for Haddingtonshire, to the Scottish Parliament in <a href="../../../1/6/7/1678.html" title="1678">1678</a>.</p>
<p>At this time, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_II_of_Great_Britain_f93a.html" title="Charles II of Great Britain">Charles II's</a> representative in Scotland was <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Maitland%2C_1st_Duke_of_Lauderdale_c2b1.html" title="John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale">John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale</a>. The Duke had taxation powers in Scotland, and maintained a standing army there in the name of the King. Fletcher bitterly opposed the Duke, whose actions only strengthened Fletcher's distrust of the royal government in Scotland, as well as all hereditary power.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/6/8/1681.html" title="1681">1681</a>, Fletcher was re-elected to the Scottish Parliament as member for Haddingtonshire. The year before, Lauderdale had been replaced by the <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_II_of_Great_Britain_7532.html" title="James II of Great Britain">Duke of Albany</a>. At this time, Fletcher was a member of the opposition Country Party in the Scottish Parliament, where he resolutely opposed any arbitrary actions on the part of the Church or state. In <a href="../../../1/6/8/1683.html" title="1683">1683</a>, after being charged with sedition and being acquitted, he fled Scotland to join with English opponents of King Charles in <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holland.html" title="Holland">Holland</a>. Fletcher joined <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Scott%2C_1st_Duke_of_Monmouth_f2b0.html" title="James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth">James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth</a> in Holland and sailed to England with his force in <a href="../../../1/6/8/1685.html" title="1685">1685</a>. Before Monmouth's rebellion could take place, though, Fletcher lost his temper in a quarrel and shot the Mayor of Taunton. He was forced to flee the country again, and this time joined <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_III_of_England_5927.html" title="William III of England">William of Orange</a> in Holland. Fletcher returned to Scotland in <a href="../../../1/6/8/1688.html" title="1688">1688</a>. His alliance with William faded, however, when Fletcher decided that William would be just another king who put England ahead of Scotland.</p>
<p>His estates were restored to him and, increasingly, Fletcher defended his country's claims over English interests, as well as opposing royal power. In 1703, at a critical stage in the history of Scotland, Fletcher again became a member of the Scottish Parliament, again as member for Haddingtonshire.</p>
<p>Now, <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_of_Great_Britain_81c8.html" title="Anne of Great Britain">Queen Anne</a> was on the throne, and there was a campaign to join England and Scotland in a parliamentary union, thus closing the "back door" to England that Scotland represented to the French The failure of the <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dari%C3%A9n_scheme.html" title="Darién scheme">Darien expedition</a> had aroused a strong feeling of resentment against England, and Fletcher and the Country party seized the opportunity to obtain a greater degree of independence for their country. Fletcher's debates on this issue made him famous. He argued against an 'incorporating union' and for a federal union, and was opposed to centralized power. He also sought to protect Scotland's nationhood. Through these debates, Fletcher was recognized as a man of integrity, whose personal interests did not influence his position; he became known as an independent patriot.</p>
<p>One of his most famous contributions were his "twelve limitations," intended to limit the power of the crown and English ministers in Scottish politics. His limitations were:</p>
<ol>
<li>THAT elections shall be made at every <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michaelmas.html" title="Michaelmas">Michaelmas</a> head-court for a new Parliament every year; to sit the first of November next following, and adjourn themselves from time to time, till next Michaelmas; That they choose their own president, and that everything shall be determined by balloting, in place of voting.</li>
<li>THAT so many lesser barons shall be added to the Parliament, as there have been noblemen created since the last augmentation of the number of the barons; and that in all time coming, for every nobleman that shall be created, there shall be a baron added to the Parliament.</li>
<li>THAT no man have vote in Parliament, but a nobleman or elected member.</li>
<li>THAT the King shall give the sanction to all laws offered by the Estates; and that the president of the Parliament be empowered by His Majesty to give the sanction in his absence, and have ten pounds <a href="../../../s/t/e/Sterling.html" title="Sterling">Sterling</a> a day salary.</li>
<li>THAT a committee of one and thirty members, of which nine to be a quorum, chosen out of their own number, by every Parliament, shall, during the intervals of Parliament, under the King, have the administration of the government, be his council, and accountable to the next Parliament; with power in extraordinary occasions, to call the Parliament together; and that in the said council, all things be determined by ballotting in place of voting.</li>
<li>THAT the King without consent of Parliament shall not have the power of making peace and war; or that of concluding any treaty with any other state or potentate.</li>
<li>THAT all places and offices, both civil and military, and all pensions formerly conferred by our Kings shall ever after be given by Parliament.</li>
<li>THAT no regiment or company of horse, foot or dragoons, be kept on foot in peace or war, but by consent of Parliament.</li>
<li>THAT all fencible men of the nation, between sixty and sixteen, be with all diligence possible armed with bayonets, and firelocks all of a calibre, and continue always provided in such arms with ammunition suitable.</li>
<li>THAT no general indemnity, nor pardon for any transgression against the public, shall be valid without consent of Parliament.</li>
<li>THAT the fifteen Senators of the College of Justice shall be incapable of being members of Parliament, or of any other office, or any pension; but the salary that belongs to their place to be increased as the Parliament shall think fit; that the office of <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_President_of_the_Court_of_Session_9a3e.html" title="Lord President of the Court of Session">President</a> shall be in three of their number to be named by Parliament, and that there be no <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extraordinary_Lord_of_Session_f495.html" title="Extraordinary Lord of Session">extraordinary lords</a>, and also, that the lords of the <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Court_of_Justiciary_08aa.html" title="High Court of Justiciary">Justice court</a> shall be distinct from those of the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Court_of_Session_09c9.html" title="Court of Session">Session</a>, and under the same restrictions.</li>
<li>THAT if any King break in upon any of these conditions of government, he shall by the Estates be declared to have forfeited the crown.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although the limitations did not pass the house, something little short of them was passed, the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Act_of_Security_1b53.html" title="Act of Security">Act of Security</a>, which made provisions in case of the Queen’s death, with the conditions under which the successor to the crown of England was to be allowed to succeed to that of Scotland, which were to be, "at least, freedom of navigation, free communication of trade, and liberty of the plantations to the kingdom and subjects of Scotland, established by the parliament of England." The same parliament passed an Act anent Peace and War, which provided that after Queen’s death, failing heirs of her body, no person at the same time being King or Queen of Scotland and England, would have sole power of making war without consent of the Scottish Parliament.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/7/0/1707.html" title="1707">1707</a>, the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Act_of_Union_1707_ebbb.html" title="Act of Union 1707">Act of Union</a> was approved by the Scottish Parliament, officially uniting Scotland with <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> to form the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_5d2d.html" title="Kingdom of Great Britain">Kingdom of Great Britain</a>. Fletcher turned from <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_politics.html" title="Scottish politics">politics</a> in despair and devoted the rest of his life to farming and agricultural development in Scotland. He died unmarried in London in September 1716. His last words were 'Lord have mercy on my poor country that is so barbarously oppressed.'</p>
<p>Contemporaries speak very highly of Fletcher's integrity, but he was also impetuous. <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burnet.html" title="Burnet">Burnet</a> describes him as "a <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotch.html" title="Scotch">Scotch</a> gentleman of great parts and many virtues, but a most violent <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republicanism.html" title="Republicanism">republican</a> and extremely passionate". <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alasdair_MacIntyre_3ef3.html" title="Alasdair MacIntyre">Alasdair MacIntyre</a> has written that <i>"Almost alone among his contemporaries Fletcher understood the dilemma confronting Scotland as involving more <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radicalism_%28historical%29.html" title="Radicalism (historical)">radical</a> alternatives than they were prepared to entertain"</i>.</p>
<p>His chief works are: <i>A Discourse of Government relating to Militias</i> (1698), in which he argued that the royal army in Scotland should be replaced by local militias - a position of republican virtue which was to return a half-century later, for example in the work of <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Ferguson_7036.html" title="Adam Ferguson">Adam Ferguson</a>; <i>Two Discourses concerning the Affairs of Scotland</i> (1698), in which he discussed the problems of Scottish trade and economics; and <i>An Account of a Conversation concerning a right regulation of Governments for the common good of Mankind</i> (1704). In Two Discourses he suggested that the numerous vagrants who infested Scotland should be brought into compulsory and hereditary servitude. In An Account of a Conversation he made his well-known remark "I knew a very wise man so much of Sir Christophers sentiment, that he believed if a man were permitted to make all the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Ballad.html" title="Ballad">ballads</a>, he need not care who should make the laws of a nation."</p>
