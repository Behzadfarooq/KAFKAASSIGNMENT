<p>Hey, thanks for the the welcome, the links were really useful. One thing I'm not too clear on though, are changes like renaming and moving articles limited to admin?

<p>Hi.I'd like to know will my page be under search when moved to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:MaxRussia/Alternative_system_of_voting" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:MaxRussia/Alternative_system_of_voting" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:MaxRussia/Alternative_system_of_voting</a>? It's really strong, isn't it? May be it's even more worthwhile then many other "encyclopaediac" articles. Max</p>
<dl>
<dd>Your article will be a bit strong, but since it was moved to a user subpage, I don't believe that it will be deleted. Articles are not sources for original thoughts; though I don't believe it will be a problem if you move it to your user subpage and then create a link to it on your user page itself. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyZ_5810.html" title="User:AndyZ">AndyZ</a> 23:15, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi andy thanks for the edit on 4th principle.</p>
<p>Hey, do you know if you can put javascript and/or flash docs on wiki??</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Sholto</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't believe there is a direct way to place javascript/flash documents onto Wikipedia, but you can always link one of the links in your user page to whatever place if it is on the web, or you could just copy the code and paste it onto a separate user subpage. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyZ_5810.html" title="User:AndyZ">AndyZ</a> 22:52, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Countdown Timer</span></h2>
<p>Hi, I think you will appreciate on reflection that JavaScript Timer is really not encyclopedic. Also "please do not post this code on your webpage." is rather redundant if you put it in Wikipedia (and thereby agree to release it under <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>). I suggest you move it to a user subpage (eg User:AndyZ/JavaScript Timer before it gets deleted. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 17:26, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanx for your help in getting me accustomed to wikipedia, ive gotten considerably better after a while&#160;:D. Would you mind running over the article <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_New_Jersey_8419.html" title="History of New Jersey">History of New Jersey</a> really quickly?

<dl>
<dd>First of all, I have to say, without reading it, <i>wow</i>. That must have been some pretty hardcore work you put into that article. I have to read it, of course, but it looks very promising. As the todo list states, refactoring will probably end up being mostly moving info to more relevant pages.</dd>
<dd>For PSATs... 80-80-67, a terrible writing score. Looks like a perfect score is still beyond my grasp.</dd>

<p><b>Hi AndyZ!</b> Thanks for the welcome. I will certaily read through the docs. Although, I am a big fan of Wiki, I am still a bit comfused about all the small (and bigger) things one needs to know by editing.</p>
<p>One of these things would be an advice on the following - I have just created a page on European Disability Forum. The acronim for this organisation is EDF, the same as for Électricité de France. When I type in EDF in Wiki search, I am automaticaly redirected to the page of this energy company. Is there any SIMPLE way to make disambiguation for EDF?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes there is, before <a href="../../../e/d/f/EDF_4768.html" title="EDF">EDF</a> was a redirect page. I have changed it to a disambiguation page.</dd>

<p>Hi, just wanted to let you know what is up with the NJ flag image. It appears that it is a caching/replication problem. Depending on which caching server or image server you get when you connect (round-robin load balancing, I think), you may or may not get the image. Hopefully the cache or image servers should all get synchronized at some point. It should sort itself out sooner or later. One trick that seems to work though, is to edit the page, select preview, which forces image resize cache to be updated on the server you are connected to. Then cancel the edit and the pic should be there. Hope this helps. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisRuvolo_a573.html" title="User:ChrisRuvolo">ChrisRuvolo</a> (<a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChrisRuvolo_1990.html" title="User talk:ChrisRuvolo">t</a>) 21:40, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

It seems like you're doing a great job with Wikipedia articles.

<p>Hi Andy, thanks for welcoming me to the Wikipedia. After posting my article, Episodic Metagames, I got a notice posted that it needed 'wickifying' and 'cleanup'. I went back and rewrote the article and tried to be more careful in formatting. I can't tell if the current notices are there since this or after this editing. If you get the chance, I'd certainly appreciate some hints on how I can clean this article up. Also, I'd like to know how to post a redirect from a request like 'EPMG' so that it will reference this site. Can you tell me how?&#160;:) Thanks LarryinLA 01:19, 23 December 2005 (UTC).</p>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_layout_59d5.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to layout">Wikipedia:Guide to layout</a> contains most of the stuff relevant to wikification, including links: [[ Link ]]. Generally, articles start with a short introduction, with the first sentence being: <b>Episodic Metagames</b> are ... (rest of sentence).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for cleaning up, this refers to the overall text of the article. Articles should follow a general format, with an introduction, the rest of the article, a References, See also, and External links section. Also, articles are placed in appopriate categories like [Category:Games]]. Also, articles don't generally state names of authors within the article itself. Also, opinionated (POV) comments generally don't go into articles, and should be written to fit an encyclopediac tone. Also, CAPITALIZING WORDS GENERALLY IS LOOKED UPON AS AN EQUIVALENT TO YELLING ONLINE... In other words, the article has to be written <i>slightly</i> better. You can view an already written article for examples for help, like <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_and_video_games.html" title="Computer and video games">Computer and video games</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for the redirect, created it at EPMG. Thanks for your contributions! <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyZ_5810.html" title="User:AndyZ">AndyZ</a> 01:43, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello AndyZ. My step-brother also plays the GameCube. I have played it before.</p>
<p>Also I cannot seem to get the "Magic Words" to work properly. In my profile, I typed CURRENTDAY and it displayed CURRENTDAY instead of Sunday. I think that I am doing something wrong or something like that. Send me some suggestions on my <a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobot569_c067.html" title="User talk:Robot569">my talk page</a>.

<dl>
<dd>04/8/2007. The reason why CURRENTDAY itself won't work is because it simply reads as regular text on the wiki. Instead, using the template format: {{CURRENTMONTH}}/{{CURRENTDAY}}/{{CURRENTYEAR}}. Most things on the wiki that do things that aren't just regular text have the {{ and }} around them. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyZ_5810.html" title="User:AndyZ">AndyZ</a> 00:50, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you AndyZ! I tried it and ... it worked! How does the grammar thing work? I am not sure what it's about is it for translating or is it just for inflections? I <b>need</b> <i>more</i> de<i>t</i>ail! I tried to translate something into Spanish and it came out English:</p>
<p>I take much pleasure in knowing you. (That was the exact text.) I hope the translation thing works! Send some stuff to me OMTP. You can send me talking messages! Wow!

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The labium argument</span></h2>
<div style="color:#000099">
<p>Welcome to Wikipedia (again)! I replaced your deleted sentence in the article <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labium.html" title="Labium">Labium</a>. It seems as if your main objection against the sentence is that it would simply be for "People who are interested in vulvas" (cough User:Alexander 007). However, your arguments aren't ground for the deletion of the sentence; conversely it results the deletion of the <a href="../../../v/u/l/Vulva.html" title="Vulva">vulva</a> in the See also section. As an encyclopedia, Wikipedia has to be factually accurate. In fact, I added more to the article about the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labium.html" title="Labium">Labium</a> and its "role". <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyZ_5810.html" title="User:AndyZ">AndyZ</a> 01:58, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
</div>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for the welcome! I didn't remove that sentence because I objected to some of the motives of "people interested in vulvas" in that <i>schoolkid looking up rude words in the dictionary</i> kind of way. I don't object to that at all - 20 years ago I would have been looking for precisely that reason! The reason I removed it was because I felt the neutrality of the article was compromised by labouring one interpretation. I've since re-read the <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> policy and realise majority opinions may receive proportionately more space in an article without necessarily being POVist.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I've reconsidered my stance therefore, and decided I'll leave that aspect of the article alone. Now I've had more time to think about it I feel my major issue is there is one article for <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labia.html" title="Labia">labia</a> (plural) and one for <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labium.html" title="Labium">labium</a> (singular). They're both alternative forms of the same word and have similar links. Perhaps they should be merged.

<p>First, it would be helpful it you would give me your complaints altogether rather than piecemeal. With that said, I have a addressed your issues regarding "son", "figure", "who donated illegal money", "weasel word", and "notable convictions". As for your issues re: the huang/riady connection and the lead sentence: 1) I have a picture of riady with huang together and I mention huang worked for riady for years and that they were both convicted of donating foreign funds. Huang, specifically through his former employer riady; 2) just because someone denies someone doesn't mean it didn't happen. The FBI, CIA, and Congress came to the conclusion that they did. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayzel68_b0f1.html" title="User:Jayzel68">Jayzel68</a> 23:38, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Is <i>Punk'd</i> "irrelevant"?</span></h2>
<p>I'm in the middle of a dispute with <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBackburner001_59e9.html" title="User:Backburner001">backburner001</a> over the <i>Punk'd</i> reference at <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lindsay_Lohan_4008.html" title="Lindsay Lohan">Lindsay Lohan</a>. This user says it's irrelevant. I laid out the case for its relevance—with a rewrite for clarity—and he deleted it again. His response: "I did my part – I removed content I felt was not significant and I made suggestions for improvement when I was asked for them. If you are interested in working together to fix this problem, do your part and improve the Punk’d reference or give me a legitimate reason for keeping the reference that was in there before." (Essentially, "You think it should stay? Prove it to me and me alone," which sounds awfully close to self-appointed WikiGodhood, but I've been called dramatic already. More on point, "working together" to this editor means he deletes it, but someone else has to "fix" it.) This user's page includes as a goal, "[r]emove irrelevant/trivial content", but a quick look at his edit history is telling: on 30 January, he removed from <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">WP:MOS</a> a "reference to naming conventions for Mormonism"; on 19 February, he deleted "2 paragraphs" from <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hiram_College_6f36.html" title="Hiram College">Hiram College</a> "to keep concise". Since then, every deletion of material has been a <i>Punk'd</i> reference, from <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lindsay_Lohan_4008.html" title="Lindsay Lohan">Lindsay Lohan</a>, <a href="../../../a/v/r/Avril_Lavigne_f30c.html" title="Avril Lavigne">Avril Lavigne</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jena_Malone_7776.html" title="Jena Malone">Jena Malone</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/y/Beyonc%C3%A9_Knowles_6a6b.html" title="Beyoncé Knowles">Beyoncé Knowles</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandy_Moore_af54.html" title="Mandy Moore">Mandy Moore</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Klein_%28actor%29_1920.html" title="Chris Klein (actor)">Chris Klein (actor)</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proof_%28rapper%29.html" title="Proof (rapper)">Proof (rapper)</a>.

<p>Hi Andy,</p>
<p>Thanks for the welcome message.</p>
<p>I have two questions for you. How can I add many "keywords" so when an article is searched using different terms, they both go on the same article? Also, is there another way to contact a wikipedian directly instead of adding a section into his/her discussion page?</p>

<p>Thanks for those suggestions - I think I've taken the article about as far as I can (and I think User:Avenue's got about to that stage too). The government section's pretty thin, but there's virtually nothing that can be said about it. I'm still not entirely sure that the citations have been done right (I'm used to APA format, so I'm struggling a bit with this), but it's better than it was. Do you think it's worth a punt on FAC now? <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 10:37, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
