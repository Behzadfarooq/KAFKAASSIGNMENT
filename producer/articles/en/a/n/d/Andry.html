It soon became apparent, however, that Andry would not enjoy life as a Lord or knight. He asked to be sent to Goddess Keep and forego his knighthood. His request was granted, and he was sent to Goddess Keep in 713.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andry.html" title="Edit section: Dragon Prince">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Dragon Prince</span></h3>
<p>Andry's life was forever changed in 719, when <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camigwen.html#Andrade" title="Camigwen">Lady Andrade</a> showed him the <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diarmadhi.html#Star_Scroll" title="Diarmadhi">Star Scrolls</a>. Working with <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lords_of_Radzyn_Keep_b0bb.html#Hollis" title="Lords of Radzyn Keep">Hollis</a>, his brother's Chosen, he deciphered the scrolls and discovered their coded secrets. Andry traveled with Andrade to that year's <i>Rialla</i>, where another potentially life altering event occurred: he met <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_of_Dragon_Prince_a6b0.html#Heroines" title="Characters of Dragon Prince">Alasen</a> of Kierst. She was <i><a href="../../../f/a/r/Faradhi.html" title="Faradhi">faradhi</a></i> gifted, but did not want to become a <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunrunner.html" title="Sunrunner">Sunrunner</a>; Andry didn't understand how she could deny a wondrous part of herself - or of him. He asked her to marry him; she turned him down, even while claiming to love him. Hurt and angered, he tried to show her what awesome gifts Sunrunners possessed, but she got frightened and ran to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_of_Dragon_Prince_a6b0.html#Ostvel" title="Characters of Dragon Prince">Ostvel</a>, whom she married. During this time Andrade, Andry's aunt and the Lady of Goddess Keep, had been killed by sorcery. Still feeling hurt and betrayed, Andry returned to <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunrunner.html#Goddess_Keep" title="Sunrunner">Goddess Keep</a> as its new Lord, even though he had yet to reach his twenty-first winter or to earn all ten <i>faradhi</i> rings.</p>
<p>Unlike the other Sunrunners he knew, when Andry looked into the Fire he saw death and destruction. This vision defined the rest of his life and reshaped the Continent.</p>
<p>During his reign as <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunrunner.html#Hierarchy" title="Sunrunner">Lord of Goddess Keep</a>, Andry made many changes, including abolishing the required half a dowry that had been payment for entering Goddess Keep, and altering the skills necessary to earn the higher <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunrunner.html#Ring_Changes" title="Sunrunner"><i>faradhi</i> rings</a>. He even created the <i>Devr'im</i> or Lords of Light, who were trained in defensive and offensive casting - and were even allowed to kill using their gifts when the occasion warranted it - a thing strictly forbidden in the past. Most of these changes occurred after Andry had seen a vision from the Goddess depicting a great war, full of death, and Radzyn Keep, Andry's beloved home, burning to the ground. Horrified by his visions, Andry readied the Sunrunners for the coming war.</p>
<p>On top of the visions, Andry's life was greatly changed by the death of his twin, Sorin, in 728. Sorin had been killed by <a href="../../../r/o/e/Roelstra%27s_Line_1e34.html#Marron" title="Roelstra's Line">Marron</a>, a sorcerer (and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Pol.html" title="Pol">Pol</a>'s half brother, though Andry did not know it at the time). This infused Andry with anger and a hatred for all <i><a href="../../../d/i/a/Diarmadhi.html" title="Diarmadhi">diarmadhi</a></i>. This, on top of his visions, caused him to search for <i>diarmadhi</i> and kill them. Andry killed Marron for Sorin's death, but did so without a trial - something Marron was owed due to his exalted birth. For this very public crime, Andry was exiled from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Desert_%28Dragon_Prince%29_b0d2.html" title="The Desert (Dragon Prince)">the Desert</a> for the length of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Rohan_b5b6.html" title="Prince Rohan">Rohan's</a> reign.</p>
<p>These, among other things, caused a rift between Andry and the rest of his family, whose allegiance was to the land and thus Rohan and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Pol.html" title="Pol">Pol</a>. Had Sorin not been slain, it was thought that Andry may not have reacted as strongly to his visions or would have had someone to share them with, who would understand and be able to reach across the chasm between the Lord of Goddess Keep and the <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Prince_8724.html" title="High Prince">High Prince</a>. However, it was not to be.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andry.html" title="Edit section: Dragon Star">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Dragon Star</span></h3>
<p>In 737, the <i><a href="../../../v/e/l/Vellant%27im.html" title="Vellant'im">Vellant'im</a></i> attacked and all of Andry's nightmares came true. Though at first still estranged from his family, by the end of the war he fought side by side with them, using his gifts alongside Pol's. He used his gifts to kill, but he protected Chayla from doing the same, knowing that she would deeply regret it later. In the wash of power, which he held from his <i><a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunrunner.html#Hierarchy" title="Sunrunner">Devr'im</a></i> and wrestled from <a href="../../../p/o/l/Pol.html" title="Pol">Pol</a>, Andry became lost in the light, spread too far. For a number of days he held on to life; he held on long enough to ask <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lords_of_Radzyn_Keep_b0bb.html#Chayla" title="Lords of Radzyn Keep">Chayla</a> to be the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunrunner.html#Hierarchy" title="Sunrunner">Lady of Goddess Keep</a>. Then, he let himself go into the light and become one with his Goddess.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andry.html" title="Edit section: Lord Andry of Goddess Keep">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Lord Andry of Goddess Keep</span></h2>
<p>Andry's reign over <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunrunner.html#Goddess_Keep" title="Sunrunner">Goddess Keep</a> forever changed the Continent. He changed age old traditions at Goddess Keep, including the ranks of <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunrunner.html#Ring_Changes" title="Sunrunner"><i>faradhi</i> rings</a>, and even changed the worship of the Goddess herself. More rituals were added, and Andry became the sole commune of the Goddess; all intercessions with her had to go through the Lord of Goddess Keep. The easy relationship the people of the Continent had with their deity was gone; a codified religion now stood in its place.</p>
<p>Sin was a concept hitherto unknown to the peoples of the Continent. Andry himself did not know of it until he read the <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diarmadhi.html#Star_Scroll" title="Diarmadhi">Star Scrolls</a>, ancient texts written by the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunrunner.html" title="Sunrunner">Sunrunner</a> <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diarmadhi.html#History" title="Diarmadhi">Lady Merisel</a>. Andry utilized sin as a tool to operate outside of the <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Prince_8724.html" title="High Prince">High Prince's Writ</a>. Heresy became a crime punishable by death, where it had never before existed. Andry felt he needed to do all of this in order to prevent the visions he was receiving from the Goddess, visions of Radzyn Keep and the Continent in flames. He was trying to shape the world, so that it would have a chance against the coming invasion - an invasion no one else believed was coming. This was the same justification Andry used for hunting down and killing <i><a href="../../../d/i/a/Diarmadhi.html" title="Diarmadhi">diarmadhi</a></i>.</p>
<p>In the end Andry's visions came true - the <i><a href="../../../v/e/l/Vellanti.html" title="Vellanti">Vellanti</a></i> invaded, <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lords_of_Radzyn_Keep_b0bb.html" title="Lords of Radzyn Keep">Radzyn</a> burned, the Continent was nearly destroyed - though they were slightly altered. For example instead of falling destroyed, Radzyn merely burned; instead of the Continent being conquered, <a href="../../../p/o/l/Pol.html" title="Pol">Pol</a> emerged victorious. These differences between Andry's visions and reality could be due, at least in part, to Andry's actions as the Lord of Goddess Keep, though the truth of this cannot be known.</p>
