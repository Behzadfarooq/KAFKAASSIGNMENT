<p>Does Andromeda the AI needs a separate mention (and article) from <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rommie.html" title="Rommie">Rommie</a>? I'm not quite certain on this issue. IMHO Andromeda is a completely separate personality and deserves its own article, but OTOH even the show credits make no such distinction. <a href="../../../s/k/r/User%7ESkroderider_1999.html" title="User:Skroderider">Skroderider</a> 13:34, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Show credits would not make a distinction. Series plots, scripts, producer comments, DVD notes, etc. all indicate two very distinct characters: Rommie the droid who walks around, and Andromeda the ship that flies around. In fact, episodes sometimes show three Andromeda: droid-Rommie, holographic-Andromeda, and ship/display screen-Andromeda, though I don't think the latter two are fully distinct personalities. Droid-Rommie has even been in conflict with ship-Andromeda in at least one episode, probably more. In the show universe they are two different characters, very clearly from at least season three on.<a href="../../../a/v/t/User%7EAvt_tor_cbb9.html" title="User:Avt tor">Avt tor</a> 20:59, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All characters after Rhade should <i>not</i> be given seperate pages, they dont play a big enough role accross the span of the series and would not meet guidelines or have enough info to warrant a page. <font face="Tahoma"><b>thanks</b>/Fenton, Matthew Lexic Dark <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MatthewFenton_0db4.html" title="Special:Contributions/MatthewFenton">52278 Alpha 771</a></font> 14:49, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agree. After G. Rhade, all the rest can be combined into a list of minor/recurring Andromeda characters the same way minor charactors on other TV show articles are listed. <a href="../../../w/l/2/User%7EWl219_bdc1.html" title="User:Wl219">Wl219</a> 18:22, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmm. The page would be fairly long, then. And why make an exception only for Gaheris? Also, from checking e. g. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Trek_characters_4bf8.html" title="List of Star Trek characters">List of Star Trek characters</a> it seems that some recurring characters do have their pages. <a href="../../../s/k/r/User%7ESkroderider_1999.html" title="User:Skroderider">Skroderider</a> 20:06, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Because Gaheris has had prominent roles in more then 1 episode, no reason why there cannot be two pages: minor &amp; reccuring. <font face="Tahoma"><b>thanks</b>/Fenton, Matthew Lexic Dark <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MatthewFenton_0db4.html" title="Special:Contributions/MatthewFenton">52278 Alpha 771</a></font> 20:08, 16 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I meant the list from Dylan to Gaheris, inclusive. Also if you look at the Star Trek list, the recurring characters there are people like Q, Guinan, Reg Barclay - people who have had <i>multiple</i> episodes revolve <i>almost entirely</i> around them or their influence on the regulars. You can't say that for people like Gerentex or Bloodmist. Start them off on a list of recurring characters; nothing about WP says we can't expand them later if it turns out people have a lot to write about them. <a href="../../../w/l/2/User%7EWl219_bdc1.html" title="User:Wl219">Wl219</a> 21:34, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fenton, Matthew: You should not talk about <b>not supporting a wiki project on a wiki project</b>. This is also a conflict of interest.&#160;;-) Wiki Communities should support each other instead of blocking. Wikipedia needs contributors and it already has this bad image. What costs a try of - lets say - 4 month? If its still as infant as now, you can remove it. --84.190.91.218 02:03, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Credits of the show state "This show is protected under laws of Canada, the United States, and other countries". Credits also state "With the particiaption of The Government of Canada," and "Fireworks, a CanWest Company." IMDB says "Country: Canada / USA ". Even the theme song is Canadian.

<p>New paragraph in this section indicates continuity errors without citing episode names. My recollection of the show is that the changes were justified in the script/dialog, so the comments seem to be POV. If another editor can cite episode titles, I can check the facts.

<p>I don't have any links handy, but I seem to remember reading somewhere that Roddenberry had intended for Andromeda to be set in the Star Trek universe, but the producers of the show decided to break the connection so that the "Federation" became the "Commonwealth", new alien races replaced the familiar Vulcans/Romulans/Klingons/Cardassians/Ferengi, etc.</p>
<p>Actually, I can't seem to find any links at all supporting this, so I'm beginning to wonder if I'm going insane. I very clearly remember reading it and thinking to myself "Holy crap, that would have been AWESOME! Why did they change it?!"</p>
<p>Is it true? Is it a myth? Is it a product of my deranged imagination? --Lode Runner</p>

<dd>My (unsourced) recollection is that it is true that Gene Roddenberry's original notes suggested this be linked to the Star Trek universe. However, in the actual version brought to air by <a href="../../../m/a/j/Majel_Roddenberry_7fb3.html" title="Majel Roddenberry">Majel Roddenberry</a>, there is no specific mention of the Star Trek universe history at all, which is to say there would be major discontinuities if the universes were linked. The extensive background history included in the Andromeda universe is sufficiently detailed to have mentioned the Federation if it happened. Approximately the same thing is true of the <a href="../../../f/i/n/Earth%7E_Final_Conflict_5c9c.html" title="Earth: Final Conflict">Earth: Final Conflict</a> universe; whatever Gene's original intent may have been, they have been developed essentially separately. I would not put any mention of this in the article without a source. <a href="../../../a/v/t/User%7EAvt_tor_cbb9.html" title="User:Avt tor">Avt tor</a> 20:56, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wasn't trying to argue that the version they produced is set in the Star Trek universe; just that Roddenberry's vision was. Yeah, we need to find a good source, but I think this is definitely worthy of inclusion in the article (and inclusion in the Earth: Final Conflict article if it's true about that series as well.) I think that this tidbit would greatly interest both Andromeda and Star Trek fans alike, especially if we could find out WHY they decided to de-Trekify it. I'm not sure that Earth: Final Conflict would have worked as a Star Trek series (what is the Trek equivalent of Taelons and why haven't we heard anything about them in the other series? Major continuity issues, I think.), I think that the basic concept behind Andromeda (one last starship as a bastion of a fallen Utopian society) would have been EXTREMELY interesting had it been applied to the Star Trek universe, and I can't fathom a good reason why they would've wanted to change it. (Disclaimer: I'm not an Andromeda fan, I think I watched maybe one and a half episodes. I'm not begrudging it; I'm just saying it wasn't quite interesting enough to hold my interest--BUT, had it been set in the Trek universe, I would have definitely given it more attention because there's just so much they could've built on--it would've been extremely interesting to watch them turn the shiny-happy-plastic-idealistic universe of Trek on its head.) --Lode Runner</dd>

<dd>I believe (and I don't have sources to hand either, sorry), that Roddenbury's <i>Andromeda</i> notes were considered for the next <i>Trek</i> after <i>Voyager</i>, but they went for <i>Enterprise</i> instead. As I recall, there was a point in 1999ish when <i>Andromeda</i> was quite close to being produced as a <i>Trek</i> series. The reason it was "de-<i>Trek</i>ified" is simply because, as the <i>Trek</i> offices had passed on it, it <i>couldn't</i> be part of <i>Trek</i>; it would be a rights issue. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelvingreen_cd1c.html" title="User:Kelvingreen">Kelvingreen</a> 19:44, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think this article is fairly good now; however, the section summarizing the plot of each series is too long within the article. IMO, most of this should be put into a separate article to be linked from here.
