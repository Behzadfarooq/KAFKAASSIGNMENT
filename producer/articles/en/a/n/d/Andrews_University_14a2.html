<p>Andrews University was founded as a small, Seventh-day Adventist school called Battle Creek College in 1874. In <a href="../../../1/9/0/1901.html" title="1901">1901</a>, the school moved from <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_Creek%2C_Michigan_17ce.html" title="Battle Creek, Michigan">Battle Creek</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michigan.html" title="Michigan">Michigan</a> to its current location in <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berrien_Springs%2C_Michigan_b681.html" title="Berrien Springs, Michigan">Berrien Springs</a>. It is said that everything the school had was packed up in 16 boxcars and sent on its way. The school was renamed <b>Emmanuel Missionary College</b>, or EMC for short.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>The school continued to grow slowly through the early 19th century. In the <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940s.html" title="1940s">1940s</a>, Nethery Hall, the current location of the College of Arts and Sciences, was built as the administration building. In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a> the graduate program and theological seminary of Potomac University were relocated from <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_D.C._323f.html" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> and joined with the school in Berrien Springs. Because of the addition of the graduate programs and the seminary in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960</a>, the school was renamed <b>Andrews University</b> in honor of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Nevins_Andrews_e302.html" title="John Nevins Andrews">John Nevins Andrews</a>, an Adventist scholar and the first officially sponsored overseas missionary for the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Today the seminary is known as the <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seventh-day_Adventist_Theological_Seminary_e28e.html" title="Seventh-day Adventist Theological Seminary">Seventh-day Adventist Theological Seminary</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a>, the undergraduate school was reorganized into the College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Technology. The School of Business was established in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a>, and the School of Education in 1983. In 1993 the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Architecture.html" title="Architecture">architecture</a> department was organized into the Division of Architecture, and has since established itself as one of the leading architecture schools of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_urbanism.html" title="New urbanism">new urbanism</a> in the United States.</p>

<p>Andrews University is located next to the Village of <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berrien_Springs%2C_Michigan_b681.html" title="Berrien Springs, Michigan">Berrien Springs</a> in southwest Michigan. The entire campus is actually located within the <a href="../../../o/r/o/Oronoko_Charter_Township%2C_Michigan_c2ea.html" title="Oronoko Charter Township, Michigan">Oronoko Charter Township</a>, adjacent to the <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Joseph_River_%28Lake_Michigan%29_8983.html" title="St. Joseph River (Lake Michigan)">St. Joseph River</a> and 12 miles away from the shores of <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Michigan_0b4b.html" title="Lake Michigan">Lake Michigan</a>. <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Bend%2C_Indiana_e4ee.html" title="South Bend, Indiana">South Bend</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indiana.html" title="Indiana">Indiana</a>, home of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Notre_Dame_aca9.html" title="University of Notre Dame">University of Notre Dame</a>, is 25 miles away; thus, several Andrews faculty members hold joint appointments with Notre Dame.</p>
<p>The 1,600-acre campus was originally designated as an arboretum. The campus maintains a variety of indigenous trees, especially around the <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quadrangle.html" title="Quadrangle">quad</a> in the center of the campus. The campus is composed of 27 instructional buildings, the Howard Performing Arts Center, an airpark, three single-sex <a href="../../../r/e/s/Residence_hall.html" title="Residence hall">residence halls</a> and four apartment complexes.</p>
<p>The three dormitories on campus are Lamson Hall, the women's hall, Meier Hall, the undergraduate men's hall, and Burman Hall, primarily for men who are either graduate or seminary students. The residence halls strictly enforce a curfew depending on a student's age, as well as a visitation policy which does not allow students of the opposite sex in dorm rooms at any time. Students living on-campus are also required to attend a number of worship services.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

<p>The university is made up of five schools/colleges and one division, offering 85 undergraduate majors and 50 graduate majors.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> In addition, post-baccalaureate degrees offered by all but the College of Technology are supervised by the School of Graduate Studies.</p>
<p>The College of Arts and Sciences, which was officially organized in 1974, is the largest of the five schools.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup> It is divided into twenty departments specializing in a wide range of areas in the fine arts, science, the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humanities.html" title="Humanities">humanities</a>, and the social sciences.

<p>The university has a total of 298 faculty members and a student-faculty ratio of 10:1.</p>

<p>An official briefing on the university website states that during a March 6, 2006 meeting of the university's Board of Trustees an executive session of the Board - one which "includes only its non-university members" - decided that "perhaps the best way to achieve new strategic directions for the university was through the opportunities that might be offered by new leadership at the school." <sup id="_ref-PresidentResigns_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PresidentResigns" title="">[13]</a></sup>. During a break in that meeting the leadership of the board asked the university president for his resignation.<sup id="_ref-SDAexplanation_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SDAexplanation" title="">[14]</a></sup> Dr. Niels-Erik Andreasen (President), Dr. Patricia Mutch (vice president of academic administration), and Dr. Ed Wines (vice president of financial administration) immediately offered their resignations<sup id="_ref-PresidentResigns_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PresidentResigns" title="">[13]</a></sup>. President Andreasen's resignation letter included the phrase "effective immediately", but three weeks later, the board announced that Andreasen would continue to serve as President until June 30, 2006, and the position of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provost_%28education%29.html" title="Provost (education)">University Provost</a> would be created to serve as the university's <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_Operating_Officer_2a90.html" title="Chief Operating Officer">Chief Operating Officer</a>.<sup id="_ref-PresidentReinstated_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PresidentReinstated" title="">[15]</a></sup> The official explanation for the board action was that student enrollment - and the resulting revenue - had increased much more modestly than expected<sup id="_ref-SDAexplanation_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SDAexplanation" title="">[14]</a></sup>, but there has been speculation about other possible causes<sup id="_ref-ATonResignation_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ATonResignation" title="">[16]</a></sup>. Dr. Andreasen has spoken publicly about these events<sup id="_ref-AndreasenAddress_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AndreasenAddress" title="">[17]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In its March 30 meeting, the Board of Trustees of Andrews University met and took two significant actions. First, the creation of the position of University Provost was voted, which is intended to function as the Chief Operations Officer of the University, focusing on day-to-day operations and execution of strategy. Second, the Board asked Dr. Niels-Erik Andreasen to continue his service to the University as President, and he agreed.</p>
