<p>This page needs a deeper explanation of the impeachment of Andrew Johnson. The ignorant reader (me) is left with no greater understanding of what Andrew Johnson was impeached than I had before I arrived at this page. The link at the bottom is a bit TOO much information - it is source material from the Harpers Weekly of the time. It has archaic prose and no analysis, so it's not very helpful. I really have no idea why Johnson was impeached, what he did to anger the radical faction. Thanks! <a href="../../../s/c/a/User%7EScarykitty_2934.html" title="User:Scarykitty">Scarykitty</a> 20:46, 22 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree, one should add something about the disagreement over the Tenure of Office Act, among other reasons for his impeachment. Stasa</p>
<p>I think it also needs more on the rest of Johnson's Presidency, and why he didn't run for re-election in 1868.</p>
<p>I definately agree with the above. It needs to tell about the importances of the impeachment. - IRT</p>
<p>Someone should put in Johnson's 1875 service in the senate in the term box at the bottom of the page. Srcastic</p>
<p>I think this little hand grenade needs some explanation: "He is regarded to be one of the worst presidents." The article explains why he was unpopular (Southerner sympathetic to the former Confederate states opposed by a Northern Congress united against him) but fails to explain what made him a bad President. Unless someone can specifically explain his defeciencies or incompetence, the "worst president ever" line seems a little biased and unjustified. --70.160.160.175 22:56, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>In regards to the Tenure of Office Act, it should probably be noted that Johnson actually named Ulysses S. Grant as Secretary of War (who then turned the post back to Stanton after the Senate refused to acknowledge it). After that, Johnson then went on to name Lorenzo Thomas. As far as I've understood it, this is why Ulysses S. Grant went on to run as Republican in his own Presidential election. Thanks! -carcrashprncess</p>
<p>I'm taking out the "Of course" in a sentence because it seems biased to me.</p>
<p>"One of the most shameful episodes in the history of the Federal Government" is not NPOV and is furthermore based on in the Dunning school which has been somewhat discredited by Foner's reconstruction history which is more commonly accepted now. I've changed it to what I think is a balance between the pro-Johnson and anti-Johnson views, but either way the idea that it was a shameful act, a mistake, and a power grab is representative of one point of view, not of objective history. Also, Wade was not really of the "same ideology" as Congress (he was much more radical than most) but maybe I'm just splitting hairs on that one so I left it for now. <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIceJew_7ff8.html" title="User:IceJew">IceJew</a> 09:49, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've placed a "Citation needed" mark on the edit mentioned here. Every historian I've ever encountered has continued in the 21st Century to portray the impeachment of Johnson as purely political and lacking in constitutional merit.

Hi. Don't know if this is the right place to put this, but the beginning of this article about Adrew Johnson is nonsense. This is what it says: "Andrew Jacksonwas never alive and was the seventeenth President of the United States (1865–1869),he was the person who assassinated Abraham Lincoln." I went to the edit this page tab and the right statement is there. Don't know how to fix it. 1st of all this is Johnson, not Jackson. Secondly, the rest of the sentence is nonesense. Can someone who knows how please fix this article. 72.79.44.5 04:01, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Oh hang on. I think I get it. He became an apprentice when he was 10 in 1818, served as an apprentice for 8 years, then ran away in 1826 when he was 18. Right? That's seems long for an apprenticeship. And "ran away" seems an odd choice of words for an 18-year-old leaving his job. Am I still misunderstanding?

<p>"-and in many ways followed the similar plan of leniency that Lincoln advocated before his death." Unless I am very wrong, Lincoln did not advocate any plan for Reconstruction before his death, though he seemed to favor the idea of black suffrage. Aside from a single speech the evening of his assassination when he spoke of difficult times ahead, he never publicly commented on the issue as far as I know. Johnson certainly did not follow Lincoln's plans for southern freedmen. Anyone have a comment? 68.40.190.172 23:24, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>In Grant's <i>Personal Memoirs</i> he says that he was aware of Lincoln's plans for the South after the war, and they would have been much milder than Johnson's. Lincoln told him (on an occasion in 1864 when several members of the Confederate government came to meet with Lincoln to discuss terms) that he (Lincoln) had told them that there were only two conditions he insisted upon: that the Union must be preserved, and that slavery must be abolished. According to Grant, "If they would accept those two conditions Lincoln would sign his name to a blank piece of paper and give it to them." <a href="../../../f/u/m/User%7EFumblebruschi_ebf8.html" title="User:Fumblebruschi">Fumblebruschi</a> 22:48, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>the articles on Lincoln and on <a href="../../../r/e/c/Reconstruction.html" title="Reconstruction">Reconstruction</a> discuss Lincoln's elaborate plans, which he started to put in effect in several states (Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee, Virginia). He fought with the Radicals who had a very harsh policy. Until summer 1865 the Radicals thought Johnson was with them, but AJ turned against them in the fall. See Harris, William C. With Charity for All: Lincoln and the Restoration of the Union (1997).

<p>Does anyone know why Johnson (when he was president) didn't have a vice president? <a href="../../../7/2/2E/User%7E72.92.84.100.html" title="User:72.92.84.100">72.92.84.100</a></p>
<p><br />
The only reason I can think of for him not having a Vice President is that one was not elected after he assumed office unexpectadly. I'm by no means an expert on this, but everything I've heard and read agree that Johnson had no Vice President. One way to find out for sure would be to see if any of the other "Accidental Presidents" (Vice Presidents who became President due to a death) had a Vice President.--70.113.79.34 23:57, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is mentioned in Trefousse but I don't have the book anymore so I can't get the page. It's also in Foner, Short History of Reconstruction, p 144, but it's only a brief mention of it so the Trefousee quote would be better. If I come across it I'll add it at that point in time I guess. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIceJew_7ff8.html" title="User:IceJew">IceJew</a> (<a href="../../../i/c/e/User_talk%7EIceJew_76dc.html" title="User talk:IceJew">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_IceJew_0857.html" title="Special:Contributions/IceJew">contribs</a>) 14:21, 17 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>No it did not apply to top people like Davis or Lee. Lee was never arrested but he feared he might be put on trial for treason (there were no treason trials at all). <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 14:57, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
