<p>P.S. One last helpful hint. To sign your posts like I did above (on <a href="../../../t/u/t/Wikipedia%7ETutorial_%28Talk_pages%29_d48f.html" title="Wikipedia:Tutorial (Talk pages)">talk pages</a>, for example) use the '~' symbol. To insert just your name, type ~~~ (3 tildes), or, to insert your name and timestamp, use ~~~~ (4 tildes).</p>
<p>Hey, I am working on a project for students of a school to upload pictures and tell where they are in life and such. I was wondering if you would share the link of your school with me so I could check it out. If so, put it in <a href="../../../c/a/v/User_talk%7ECavebear42_00ac.html" title="User talk:Cavebear42">MY TALK PAGE</a>. gl w/ your project <a href="../../../c/a/v/User%7ECavebear42_d406.html" title="User:Cavebear42">Cavebear42</a> 19:16, 5 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am the moderator of an e-mail list for former pupils of a particular school in England. We have our own website where we collect old school photographs and such-like. We are now considering writing a history of the school.</p>
<p>Wiki technology seems ideal for such a collaborative venture, but would it be appropriate for a Wikipedia article? It would, by its nature, appeal only to a very small number of people - a few hundred at most.</p>
<p>Advice please.</p>

<dd>If the school is notable (a large school, the first school to do something important), etc. it is usually considered as deserving of a Wikipedia article. Otherwise, the MediaWiki software is always available for download, and you can install it on your own website, and I suppose you could have a wiki for your school (which is what a few schools do actually). But don't take <i>only</i> my word on it, I'd wait until someone else responded (if only to confirm what I'm blathering on about&#160;;) <a href="../../../i/l/y/User%7EIlyanep_a09d.html" title="User:Ilyanep"></a> — <a href="../../../i/l/y/User%7EIlyanep_a09d.html" title="User:Ilyanep"><font color="grey">Ilγαηερ</font></a> <a href="../../../i/l/y/User_talk%7EIlyanep_ef6d.html" title="User talk:Ilyanep"><font color="#333333">(Tαlκ)</font></a> 13:57, 5 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why the criteria? Isn't the fact that it's an established educational institution (I assume) enough? That's the kind of thing that is clearly relevant for inclusion in an encyclopedia. We probably have <i>hundreds</i> of articles about schools of all sorts. Why shouldn't we include as many as possible? As is often said, <b>this ain't paper</b>. (Besides, at least their goal will be to create a substantive article, as others have pointed out.) - <a href="../../../d/c/l/User%7EDcljr_a662.html" title="User:Dcljr">dcljr</a> 01:09, 6 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>It depends on many factors, but I would think about two things:
<ol>
<li>Would the article appeal to more than a negligible amount of people?</li>
<li>Are the article's facts verifiable from another source?</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you answer yes to both questions, you're set to go, IMO. This isn't set in stone or anything, so I suggest you wait for others to weigh in as well. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 13:59, 5 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would say that if a decent article can be written on the subject it would be a welcome addition. People often create useless one-sentence articles for schools and other institutions, and these tend to annoy people and are liable to be deleted. If you write more than a few lines of decent prose, and maybe include a picture or two, it will almost certainly be kept, even if someone of what we call the deletionist mindset lists it on <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_b940.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion</a>. Wikipedia has articles on very minor things, tiny villages of less than 20 people, obscure fictional characters etc. Consensus seems to be that as <a href="../../../w/w/i/WP%7EWWIN_b86f.html" title="WP:WWIN">Wiki is not paper</a> there is no harm in including these things provided they aren't just nonsense articles. The MediaWiki software might be worth considering if you want to start up a collaborative project of your own with people contributing lots of photos and memories, as that doesn't belong on Wikipedia, as I'm sure you can understand. My advice is to write the article, keep a copy of it so you can put it up elsewhere on the off chance that it's deleted, and then if someone lists it on VfD wait and see what happens. I am confident though that it won't be deleted. — <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilobite_212d.html" title="User:Trilobite">Trilobite</a> <a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETrilobite_e418.html" title="User talk:Trilobite">(Talk)</a> 14:57, 5 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You should be aware of the considerable ongoing controversy here surrounding school articles. I would have to say that there's a good chance of this article becoming the subject of debate as to whether it should be kept, perhaps even a test case, and therefore some chance it would be deleted. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 18:22, 5 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While I understand that we are debating articles on schools releventness here, I have a feeling that the vote would not be to remove them when/if it ever comes to vote. Even if this article does end up being deleted, an admin could easily recover his data for him and he can move his venture to another location (perhaps a metawiki of his own). During the interm Wikipedia could offer the exact tool he is looking for to get this article edited. There are a lot of articles which have far less significance than a school. There are articles which have far fewer people editing/interested in them than it sounds his will be once he posts it to his page. I say "be bold", make your article, handle the problems when or if they ever arise. <a href="../../../c/a/v/User%7ECavebear42_d406.html" title="User:Cavebear42">Cavebear42</a> 19:11, 5 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Schools in general are <b>controversial.</b> There is no general agreement about them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is quite possible that someone will put your school article up for "votes for deletion" and an ugly notice will appear at the top for a while. Do not panic. If what you contribute is a good history of your school; if it is at least, say, five paragraphs long; if it gives <i>some</i> reason why your school is worthy of an article in an encyclopedia (notable alumni, recently mentioned in the news); and if it is written so that the article is genuinely interesting—at the very least, interesting to alumni of the school—then, although it may be listed on Votes for Deletion, it has a very good chance of surviving. Some Wikipedians are "deletionists" and feel it is important to remove articles that are not "encyclopedic." Some Wikipedians are "inclusionists" and a number of them are on record as feeling that all high schools should be included; some of them systematically vote "keep" whenever a high school article comes up for deletion. Some feel that it depends on whether the high school is notable and whether or not the article is a good article. Despite the phrase "vote," articles are only deleted when there is a "rough consensus to delete," which means that it only takes a little support for an article to be kept.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So, if what you want is to contribute an article on your high school, go for it. My suggestion is: just try to make sure you have a fairly decent article before you push that "save" button for the first time. And if it comes up on Votes for Deletion, don't panic, participate in the discussion, and concentrate on improving the article rather than fighting the (sometimes obnoxiously argumentative) participants.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you have historical photographs and are certain that they are public domain, or that the person who took them is willing to release them under the GFDL, they would be really good to put in.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As you develop the article, do not hestitate to put notes on the Talk (also called the Discussion) page for your article. Begin by saying on the Talk page that you asked about this here in the Village Pump and got advice to the effect that it would be OK as long as the article was well done. If you save a short article and you have a lot more material to put in, say something on the Talk page to that effect ("Just a start, more to come.") This sort of thing will definitely be noticed and taken into account, and you may get helpful advice on the talk page.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>By the way, I am sure I speak for everyone when I say that I appreciate your <i>asking.</i> [[User:Dpbsmith|<a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a>]] 00:24, 7 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>
