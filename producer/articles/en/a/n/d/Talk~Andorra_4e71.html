<p><b>"Catalan" or "Spanish" Co-prince</b></p>
<p>The term "Catalan co-prince" of Andorra is incorrect for three reasons. First, the co-prince of Andorra does not have this title because he is Catalan, but because is a member of the Roman Catholic hierarchy. Second, prior to the use of the euro, Andorra used the peseta, the <i>Spanish</i> currency. Therefore, monetary issues were not dealt with Catalan government, but with the central bank of Spain (Banco de España). Any relations with Andorra would be through the central government, not the Generalitat. Third, defense of Andorra is still the responsibility of Spain and France, not Catalonia and France. Therefore, because the co-prince is a member of the <i>Spanish</i> Roman Catholic hierarchy, because monetary issues are controlled by <i>Spain</i> (along with France), and because military issues are decided by <i>Spain</i> (and France), the co-prince is not a co-prince because he is Catalan, he is co-prince because he is <i>Spanish</i>, not Catalan.</p>

<dd>I should look into this more before suggesting it, but isn't he called the "Copríncep Episcopal"? -- User:Docu</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>OK. You are nationalist and you only want to introduce the word "Spanish" instead of "Catalan". But there isn't relation between what you said and these words. There is no relation between the currency (who is the co-prince of San Marino, or Monaco? What used them?). Only France (no Spain) have to defence Andorra. And the most important: the co-prince is the Bishop of Urgell now, and centuries before the creation of Spain (catholic, OK, but it doesn't point to Spain more than to Catalonia). You want to write the word Spain, OK, but the reasons that you comment are absurd, and only follows to politicize the article. Then I suggest neutral terms like Episcopal Co-pince or Urgeil Co-prince. <a href="../../../l/l/u/User%7ELlull_fbf8.html" title="User:Llull">Llull</a> 19:03, 16 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>From Peter Wye,</p>
<p>The politically neutral "Episcopal Co-prince" is actually a very good idea. I have made the change. But please do not attack my character here. I would never do that to anyone, and I expect it not to be done to me.</p>
<p>"Only France (no Spain) have to defence Andorra."</p>

<p>Is it me, or does anyone else find it odd that Andorra's title is cited in Catalan (obviously) &amp; French, but....not Castilian Spanish?</p>
<p>If Andorra's history is so deeply intertwined with that of her neighbors, wouldn't it be a bit remiss to leave the Spanish title out of it, while including the French?</p>
<p>Or is this a political omission, e.g. POV?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Andorrans, in common with the neighbouring regions of Spain (and less widely France) speak Catalan as their first language. Andorra's relations have always been with Madrid rather than Barcelona as there has never, in modern times been an independent Catalan state, only an autonomous region within Spain, but if they were treated as seperate at all, Andorra would be considered part of the Catalan "community", not the Castillian one. I hope that makes sense.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Of course, although Catalan is the local language, so much of Andorra's economy is based on tourism and day-trippers from France and Spain that most people also have good if not fluent French AND Castillian Spanish.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also worth remembering is that although the co-prince on the French side was a head of STATE (The King and then the President), on the Spanish side it was a local bishop - whose seat is very firmly in Catalan territory. Esquimo 16:00, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmm, that's interesting! Then several places say Andorra signed a treaty specifically to avoid getting dragged into WWII, which means it needed to happen before WWII. How's this for a random theory: the treaty was signed in 1939 and ...uh, I don't know how countries go about these things, but maybe the treaty was <i>ratified</i> in 1958. Taking the definition of the word "decree" as "Decree is an order by a head of state or government that has the force of law", i.e. the treaty was signed into a law in Andorra.

<dd>Regarding the actual issue under discussion, who knows? 1939 makes sense in that World War II had just broken out and Andorra may have needed to clarify its position; 1958 may make sense in that the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Economic_Community_18c5.html" title="European Economic Community">European Economic Community</a> was established in that year and loose diplomatic ends may have needed to be tied up. There may even have been two separate events in question, one in each of the years. Note however that a large number of sources cite 1939 including the Catalan Wikipedia (Catalan is the official language of Andorra), so it seems likely that <i>something</i> occurred in 1939 and was possibly merely re-affirmed in 1958 (perhaps all treaties signed with the Nazi regime were considered null and void after the war). Go ahead and research it if you like, but it's a mere piece of trivia after all. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 21:48, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, I traced the 1939 error to its origin for you idiots. (Yes, idiots. What do I care for WP:NPA if you block me anyway. You <i>are</i> idiots.) It comes from here: <a href="http://www.webcom.com/duane/txt/humor/true.txt" class="external free" title="http://www.webcom.com/duane/txt/humor/true.txt" rel="nofollow">http://www.webcom.com/duane/txt/humor/true.txt</a>. And look what it says: "A peace treaty was finally signed with Germany on September 25, 1939, during the invasion of Poland at the start of WW2. This document brought peace to the Andorrans for the first time in 44 years and officially ended the first world war." Notice something? 1914 + 44 = 1958. This story obviously started from the true 1958 event but then mangled the year (among other things - it also absurdly describes Andorra as an "agean nation" and in another story claims that pi wasn't known to 3 decimal places in 1897, so you can see how credible this is). And from this idiotic site the other idiotic sites you idiots quoted got their idiotic idiocy. But rather than sinking in shame I'm sure Curps will continue to revert on principle and rather spread disinformation. Arrodna 03:08, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As I expected, you dig your hole deeper. What "dozens or hundreds" of websites are you talking about? You cited three so far, and you could hardly find more than ten unless you count Wikipedia mirrors. And not all sites must have copied it from webcom.com, obviously. B copies from A, C from B, etc. Maybe webcom.com itself copied its entire story from elsewhere, but it shows how the <i>error</i> originated, as the "1939" and the "44 years" are directly contradictory. If you want to make believe that the "44 years" were the error and it's just a coincidence it adds up to 1958, you're an even greater moron than I thought. Arrodna 04:16, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You fail to make a persuasive case, and name-calling only hurts your credibility. Here's another perfectly plausible scenario: the webcom.com site originally made the same error as you and used the incorrect 1958 date, and its author wrote the "44 years" phrasing in accordance (as pure embellishment just to puff up the number of words... since Andorra was never the theatre of military operations and was thousands of kilometers from the nearest front, it was at peace all along, anyway). Later, the author discovered the error and corrected it to 1939, but carelessly forgot to change the "44 years" accordingly.</dd>

<dd>It said "peace for the first time in 44 years", not "44 years of peace", you braindead fool. If World War I for Andorra lasted from 1914 to 1958, then 1958 was the first time of peace since 1914, i.e. in 44 years. And it is perfectly normal that a piece of information about an obscure matter appears somewhere on the Web for the first time, and then spreads around, whether it's true or not. And the first website may well disappear later, yet the misinformation stays. That's why no information whatsoever should ever be taken from random websites of no editorial authority, and yet your entire case for 1939 rests on such sites. Even if you had no other date specifically contradicting the 1939 one, it would be inacceptable (not just per common sense but also per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>) to use the 1939 date based merely on those Web sources.

And there are not "many other examples". Go ahead, cite them. You are probably too stupid to recognize Wikipedia mirrors (or just sites that copy parts of Wikipedia, like <a href="http://www.abcduvoyage.com/voyage/voyage-europe/voyage-andorre.php" class="external text" title="http://www.abcduvoyage.com/voyage/voyage-europe/voyage-andorre.php" rel="nofollow">this</a> has the exact same text as the French Wikipedia). They are also an important reason why your insistence on keeping the misinformation is so criminal. This spreads so far that it will seem to idiots like you that it "must be true" if there are so many "sources" agreeing on it! One idiotic website started putting up the misinformation, then other idiotic websites copied it, then some idiot put it into the English Wikipedia, then other Wikipedias copied it from there, etc. Shame on you, scum.

<p>The <i>Times</i> citation appears to be valid (I just checked it). The article is a single paragraph, exactly as quoted above. That said, it would be interesting to know what did (or did not) occur in 1939, since Andorra was technically in a state of war with Germany from the previous war.</p>
<p>I want to say something else, though: the restoration of a correct date for a relatively unimportant and symbolic event is not <i>nearly</i> as important as behaving with some degree of civility. Calling other users "stupid" and "scum" is far more of an issue than presenting a piece of trivia accurately. Edit warring via a series of sockpuppets isn't much less heinous. I have blocked the numerous accounts used by this person (presumably Wik) in this process. I cannot comment further without leaving the bounds of civility myself, though I will admit that I am tempted. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 05:50, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No less an authority than Encarta says Andorra was neutral in World War I though <a href="http://encarta.msn.com/text_761554662__1/Andorra.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://encarta.msn.com/text_761554662__1/Andorra.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> (which makes a certain sense, since Andorra was jointly ruled by two co-princes, one of whom was Spanish and therefore neutral). And this doesn't preclude the possibility that there may indeed have been two events, one in 1939 and one in 1958 and the latter was needed as "re-affirmation" at the time of the establishment of the European Economic Community, since it's very likely that any treaties signed with the Nazi regime had been declared null and void at the end of World War II. After all, the Federal Republic of Germany was not established until 1949 amid a very broad repudiation of all aspects of the previous regime and probably signed all its own treaties from scratch. Would it be possible to do a search of 1939 newspapers as well, specifically for the date of September 25 1939? And what does Britannica say?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The 1958 date alone (with no 1939 event) doesn't make sense for one very major reason: in 1942 the Germans occupied the remaining territory of Vichy France and Andorra thereupon had German troops on its border (not merely figuratively, but quite literally, to control border crossings, smuggling, Resistance agents entering and leaving, etc... see for instance, this reference: <a href="http://www.aet-association.org/aet/articles/aetarticledefond.2005-04-28.0885178789.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aet-association.org/aet/articles/aetarticledefond.2005-04-28.0885178789.pdf" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> which mentions German soldiers entering Andorran territory to seize French would-be escapees, and a number of other references <a href="http://www.gers.pref.gouv.fr/acvg/documents/42-44.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gers.pref.gouv.fr/acvg/documents/42-44.htm" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> <a href="http://musee.delaresistance.free.fr/educatif/dossier/jeunes_charentais.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://musee.delaresistance.free.fr/educatif/dossier/jeunes_charentais.pdf" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> to Resistance members transiting through Andorra). So if it occurred to anyone to make damn sure that Andorra was truly in a state of peace and neutrality with Germany, that surely would have been a priority in 1942 at the very latest (or more likely 1939), when it was an actual, pressing, and very real issue and not an abstract amusing historical or diplomatic footnote as in 1958.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, the whole thing is not particularly relevant: after all, Japan and the Soviet Union never signed a peace treaty at the conclusion of World War II because of territorial disputes over the <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kuril_Islands_c249.html" title="Kuril Islands">Kuril Islands</a> which remain unresolved to this day, yet it would be rather pointless to make the claim that Japan and Russia are at war to this day. I doubt very much that our articles on either <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a> or <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a> mention this, although specialized articles on the World War II peace treaties might appropriately mention it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Given the verifiability issues as per <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiability_beed.html" title="WP:Verifiability">WP:Verifiability</a> and lack of clarification about what very likely was some kind of event in 1939, and the lack of any real relevance, perhaps the best thing to do would be to simply remove this bit of trivia altogether from the <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andorra.html" title="Andorra">Andorra</a> article, and perhaps move it to <a href="../../../p/a/r/Participants_in_World_War_I_cc2b.html" title="Participants in World War I">Participants in World War I</a>, which lists Andorra (possibly incorrectly) as a participant. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 08:22, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This would represent an increase from the 2004 census. Can someone check on this? Eve 18:58, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I remember reading that tobacco growing is actually a ruse. Andorran tobacco is bad quality, but when it is harvested, it is burnt, and the Andorran authorities allow the (duty-free?) importing of an equivalent amount of foreign quality which is then sold. --84.20.17.84 10:57, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is certainly something very dodgy about Andorra and its tobacco trade:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>"...Andorra is important because it illustrates the role of the tobacco industry. Andorra was not only supplying illegal cigarettes to the Spanish market but also to the United Kingdom. Exports from the United Kingdom to Andorra (which has a population of only 63 000) increased from 13 million cigarettes in 1993 to 1 520 million in 1997. Since few of these cigarettes were legally re-exported and Andorran smokers do not generally smoke British brands, then either each Andorran (including children and non-smokers) was smoking 60 British cigarettes a day in 1997 or these cigarettes were being smuggled out of Andorra..."</i><a href="http://www.who.int/tobacco/training/success_stories/en/best_practices_spain_smuggling_control.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.who.int/tobacco/training/success_stories/en/best_practices_spain_smuggling_control.pdf" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></dd>

<p>I don't know if it is the above anon user or another one who keeps pushing "the official language is Catalan, shared by Catalonia, Valencia, Balearic islands and other territories" but it could well be, as he is very concerned in "the reality of Catalan language in Catalonia and other places in south Europe". Anyway, to whoever is pushing that version, please note that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the article is not about Catalan language and its distribution. It's about Andorra.</li>
<li>I don't see in similar articles "the official language of Monaco is French, shared with France, parts of Belgium, parts of Switzerland and many other territories". Nor I see "the official language of Liechtenstein is German, shared with Germany, Austria and parts of Switzerland". Nor I see "the language of San Marino is Italian, shared with Italy".</li>
</ul>
<p>It just doesn't make sense. Nor it makes sense here. I think is quite obvious.</p>

<dd>I think it's obviously not the same situation with Andorra and with all the contries you said. Is Monaco the only recognized Country with French as the only official language? I think it is quite strange situation that a language as Catalan is the only official language only in one of the smallest territories where it is spoken, and I think it's interesting to remark this situation (and I find Andorra, being THE country with this very singularity, perfectly suitable to have this remark in its article). Finaly, I find (again) your comparisons quite bad, since German, French and Italian, having an independent country behind the language, don't need a presentation anywhere. Catalan however... who knows what's Catalan?--<a href="../../../../ca/x/t/v/Usuari%7EXtv_dc43.html" class="extiw" title="ca:Usuari:Xtv">Xtv</a> - (<a href="../../../x/t/v/User_talk%7EXtv_7e5f.html" title="User talk:Xtv">my talk</a>) - (<a href="../../../../ca/x/t/v/Usuari_Discussi%C3%B3%7EXtv_5baa.html" class="extiw" title="ca:Usuari_Discussió:Xtv">que dius que què?</a>) 17:35, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As Mountolive said, <i>"the article is not about Catalan language and its distribution. It's about Andorra."</i> If someone wants to know what catalan is, he should go to the catalan article.

<dd>If you put "Catalan, shared with Catalonia, Valencia, the Balearic islands and 'other territories'" is like if I was introduced to someone and he said "Hi, I'm Andorran, but my penis is not small, it has an average size" do you know what I mean? (if people keeps pushing for strange redactions finally I will have to surrender a bit to Maurice's theory hehehe)</dd>
<dd>Now more seriously speaking: even from a Catalanist POV, you should appreciate the fact that your language is <b>normal</b> and doesn't need further explanation nor further justifications, like "hey, it is shared with this and that and that" because normal languages don't need this.

<p>Why would you want to talk about penises anyway? Catalan is the official language in Andorra. The Andorran government has to work quite hard to gat people to use it, given the large immigrant population and the general knowledge of several other languages, but its official status is a fact. Catalan is also an official language in the autonomous community of Catalonia and (under the name of Vlaencian) in the Communidad Valenciana.

<dl>
<dd>Your statement about the andorran government having problems to gat people to use catalan is not founded. Andorran education is given completely in catalan except the lective hours of "foreign languages". English is mandatory and students may choose between Spanish and French as a second foreign language. Everything in Andorra except tourism-related businesses use catalan as the main language. Wanting to make sure that every article of the so called "catalan-speaking world" explains every single place where catalan is spoken (which BTW, besides Andorra and Catalonia is almost everywhere spoken by less the 50% of the population) is just a matter of the size of our penises. <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaurice27_b87e.html" title="User:Maurice27">Maurice27</a> 15:50, 5 March 2007 (UTC)
