<p>Andre was born at Coulommiers and not at Grenoble or some where else. <b>It's very important to Wikipedia to change this information</b>. Marianne, Andre's mother, never came in the French Alpes. Every brothers and sisters of Andre were born in Seine et Marne, near Paris. It's very important to Wikipedia to change Grenoble to Coulommiers. You can contact me for that. Coulommiers is famous for his production of Brie, very famous cheese. (User:Boris Roussimoff, Andre's nephew)</p>

<p>Andre the giant was 7ft 5in. You people keep going on about how he was measured at 24 at 6ft 10in, he had gigantism, which doesnt stop him growing at the age of 21 like normal people he can continue to grow, and he lived to the age of 45 for crying out loud. Also, his official site states that at Wrestlemania III he was measured at 7ft 5in. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignick666_ea5b.html" title="User:Bignick666">User:Bignick666</a></p>
<p>This is a little too hagiographic to me, but I don't feel qualifed to be the one to try to clean it up. Any takers?</p>
<p>User:YesBeard</p>
<p>I think it's correct that he was 6ft 9 1/2 throughout most of his career, considering you lose a bit with age. But 6ft 9 1/2 is not 220 cm as written on the page, it's 207 cm.</p>

<p>I'm responsible for most of the current entry and i'm sorta curious on what parts would be overly worshipful.</p>
<p>Also, i'm sorta unsure about using "André" over "Andre". Sure, his real name was spelled "André" but I'm not sure if he was ever billed as "André the Giant" while wrestling in the US, Japan or Canada.</p>

<p>He was supposedly 7 ft 4 in. tall, but if you look at the photos of him, he was more likely 6'11 or 7 ft tall. His weight was really over 500 lbs at one time though. Andre wore a size 22 US shoe.</p>
<p>Not wishing to start an "edit war", but Ah-nold would best be described as the <i>future</i> governor of "Khalifornia", not because that's in the future <i>now</i>, but because it certainly was when "Conan" was shot and released.</p>

<p><b>I No His Real Name Was "André" But He Always Wrestled As "Andre The Giant" Never As "André The Giant" - Well Professionally Anyway</b></p>
<p>I'm wondering how accurate the claim that the airlines had to 'reshuffle cargo and passengers' to accomodate his body-- he didn't weigh a thousand pounds; he weighed like 400. so this is what-- two, maybe three people? the paraphrased statement makes it sound like this was a huge issue, but it can't have been, even with a coffin.</p>
<p>OK I work as ground crew at an airport.... with his size he would have disrupted filling a pit ( cargo hold...) so he would certainly have disrupted the loading of any plane smaller than a 747... ie a 737 would have a lot of trouble shipping someone his size in a coffin...</p>
<p>I have to agree, my family has been in the aviation business since the early 40's and with the type of aricraft that would have been used in 1993 would caused disruptions, remember he died over 10 years ago alot has changed in the way of aviation technology since then. Sometimes I think some of you people think that the technology we have now would have been used then.</p>

<p>In a post in celebheights.com, someone states that according to Andre's trainer, he was "legitamately measured at 7'1.5" Also, during his wrestling career, his weight ranged anywhere from 380 - 540 lbs</p>
<p><a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Meltzer_f6dc.html" title="Dave Meltzer">Dave Meltzer</a> says 6'9 3/4 in his book Tributes II when André was 24 and I think it's highly unlikely that he would have grown another almost four inches after that. --<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarren_Jowalsen_31c2.html" title="User:Darren Jowalsen">Darren Jowalsen</a> 20:39, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>He had giantism a disease where you can't stop growing so it's likely that he <b>did grow four inches after that --<a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrick_man01_98ed.html" title="User:Trick man01">Trick man01</a> 10:01, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</b></p>

<p>The big problem with Andre's height is that the article claims he is only 6'10 - and so is Big John Studd!!! Did you ever see them in the ring together? Andre made Studd (and the 6'5 King Kong Bundy) look like midgets. Unless Studd and Bundy were sub 6 foot, Andre must be well above 7 feet. He grew well into his twenties too and went from a 390 lb wrestler early in his career to the 500+ pound giant he retired as. (Also Bundy billed himself at 450 - if he was only 50 lbs less than Andre, I'd again be surprised. Check out the tapes of Andre and Studd and then tell me Andre is only 6'10.</p>
<p>User:YesBeard</p>
<p>Andre was only 6'10, look at the Wrestlemania III match, Andre has about 4 inches on Hogan tops, who was said to be 6'8 in the match by the commentators, which would make Andre 7ft 0". But the problem is that Hulk is a legit 6'4 these days and was most probably 6'5 then, making Andre about 6'9-6'10. And also, on a funny note. Despite the visible 4 inch approximate difference, Gorilla Monsoon calls Hulk 6'8 and Andre 7'5, that would make Andre 9 inches taller, or three-quarters of a foot taller than Hulk, which he visibly wasn't.</p>

<dd>Respected wrestling and mixed martial arts journalist and author Dave Meltzer wrote the following in his book <i>Tributes</i>:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But he was not 7'4", or even close to that height. At his tallest, he was probably around 6'10", maybe 6'11". Basketball players who met him generally estimated his height at around 6'9", although because he was proportioned completely differently that any 6'9" man around - with relatively short legs, a long torso and huge head - their estimates may have been deceptive. In 1976, When Andre had his famous boxer vs. wrestler match at Shea Stadium against Chuck Wepner on the undercard of the Muhammed Ali vs. Antonio Inoki fiasco, legitimate sportswriters who took notice of Andre for the first time estimated him at 6'9". However, later in his career, Andre posed in Numerous photographs with Shohei "Giant" Baba, and he appeared to be around an inch or two taller that the 6'8" Japanese giant. (p. 40)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In <i>Tributes II</i>, Meltzer wrote the following:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The 7-4 figure created when he first came to Montreal in late 1970, was probably because the most famous tall athlete in the world at the time, basket ball star …Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, was 7-2, and promoters wanted to bill him as the tallest athlete in the world. The last time he was measured in France, at the age of 24, [1970], he was 6-9 3/4. (p. 68)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>He also wrote:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>His best drawing matches would be against men who were at least close to his size … perhaps his biggest opponent during the 1970s, Ernie Ladd, a 6-9 1/2, 320 pound former all-pro football lineman whom he drew many big gates against in the Battle of the Giants. Ironically, because Ladd had achieved so much fame in football before wrestling as his real height was known, promoters never tried to exaggerate his height as they would have normally been the case in those days. It was funny, because Andre at the time was billed as 7-5, yet the two were roughly the same height. (pp. 73-74)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>

<dd>So, he was about 6'10" in 1970, the same in 1976 and throughout the 70's and seems to be about 6'10" during the 1980s so the data is pretty consistent, Andre the Giant was 6 feet and 10 inches tall. Big John Studd was really about 6' 7" at that time and Andre's physique made him look bigger than he actually was in comparison to other wrestlers. --<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarren_Jowalsen_31c2.html" title="User:Darren Jowalsen">Darren Jowalsen</a> 20:45, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It should also be noted that Andre had lifts inside his boots to give him an extra inch or two. I'd imagine he was done growing by his mid twenties. He may've made it to a legitimate 6'10" (Another 1/4th of an inch is reasonable), but that's it.</p>
<p>The problem with Andre's height it that he never stopped growing, but operations decreased his height. It is not impossible for a man with Andre's condition to continue growing after his 24th birthday. I've read in magazines that at his peak he was mabbe 6,11, but in the latter part of his career when his body was breaking down, he went down to 6'9. Which seems reasonable. This is from Powerslam magazine,w hich always tries to get the legit height of a wrestler.</p>
<p>I also remember that Andre's back surgeries resulted in him losing several inches in height. I recently purchased one of the WrestleMania box sets and in comparison to Hulk Hogan and Andre The Giant, Andre IS NOT 7'5" inches in height, as Gorilla Monsoon states during their match at WrestleMania III. Hogan is referred to at being 6'8" by Jesse Ventura in order to exaggerate Andre's size. If I'm not mistaken, Hogan's actual height is about 6'3" or 6'4" which would have put him 12-14 inches shorter than Andre and Andre simply wasn't that much taller. At the most, I'd put Andre about 6'10" during Wrestle Andre's actual height has always been a source of debate and I don't know all the circumstances surrounding the debate. I've read that the surgery shortened Andre's height to some degree. I suppose Andre's condition resulted in him losing bone density and actually shrinking somewhat, such as what happens to some suffering from Osteoperosis. But, that's just a guess on my part. I believe the surgery took place sometime I after WrestleMania and after he filmed The Princess Bride because during the fimling fight scene with Cary Elwes character, Andre's back was so bad he wasn't able to support Elwes' weight on his back and they had to use a stunt double, who was much smaller than Andre. Andre's weight is also somewhat debated. It did fluccuate greatly over the course of his career. During WrestleMania III, I would honestly say he was probably about 520 pounds, which is what he was billed at. During WrestleMania IV however, he was noticably much slimmer and more mobile in the ring when compared to the previous WrestleMania. He was still billed at weighing 520 pounds but I'd say he was somewhere closer to 450 pounds. <a href="../../../o/d/i/User%7EOdin%27s_Beard_da35.html" title="User:Odin's Beard">Odin's Beard</a></p>
<p>He had his surgery before the WM3 match. If rumour is correct, he had 15 bottles of wine before the match and was seriously taped up for it as well.(<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalbared_d043.html" title="User:Halbared">Halbared</a> 12:54, 30 March 2006 (UTC))</p>
<p>Hogan's real height (at least back in 1987) was 6'8". He was not just 6'3". That's absurd. DiBiase is 6'3" or 6'4", and Hogan was a bit taller than DiBiase. Andre <i>towered</i> over Hogan at <i>WrestleMania III</i>. Andre may have not been 7'4", but he certainly was over 6'10". People can also grow past the age of twenty-one, especially with gigantism. I've grown somewhat myself. I also seem to remember back at old WrestleMania fanfests that the WWE had life-size cutouts of Andre the Giant, which were used for kids to measure their height. The height of those cutouts was 7'4". <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolitician818_2c9b.html" title="User:Politician818">Politician818</a> 17:01, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
A promotional cut-out is very likely to be inflated to keep the aura, especially if it's for kids. The evidence stated before from Dave Meltzer shows that he was consistently around six foot and ten inches. Non-wrestling media reported him as such, and I think that is more reliable than the usually hyperbole laced wrestling press. Also, the height listed is from when he was 24, not 21. No strong evidence of further growth has been proven and people with gigantism to do not gain any height after puberty.--<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarren_Jowalsen_31c2.html" title="User:Darren Jowalsen">Darren Jowalsen</a> 22:19, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Probably quite true aboot the cut-out. As for Hogan, he was not 6'8, You would have to increase the height for every other wrestler. DiBase is more like 6'1-6'2. Take a look at the Hogan discussion pages for a more accurate description of his height.(<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalbared_d043.html" title="User:Halbared">Halbared</a> 11:39, 17 May 2006 (UTC))</p>

<dd>Even with a huge wig on Wilt doesn't look like he can possibly have 3 inches on Andre. 6'9 3/4" was his measure height at death (according to autopsy reports) I have read, and no way was Andre the same size at death and 24, he visibly lost height in his later years. I think Meltzer was dead wrong on this one and alot of his information is rather questionable IMO. TheSentinel 18:00, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That looks like a pretty good case for making Andre closer to 7 feet. I would also say that I don't know how Melzter worked it out, but the line goes to the top of Wilt's head, not Andre's, and that Wilt is standing slightly in the foreground, both these things would give Wilt a lil extra height on Andre, making them in my mind, closer still. The film was in 1984, and Andre seems to be still leanish and standing quite straight.(<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalbared_d043.html" title="User:Halbared">Halbared</a> 21:23, 20 July 2006 (UTC))</dd>

<p>So if he was 6'10" at age 24, he probably didn't grow anymore than this in terms of linear growth, because of Epiphyseal fusion. Add 2 inches of tall healed, size 22 boots, and 4 inches of puffy hair and you have yourself a ~7ft4 inch man. Andre probably averaged around 425-450 lbs throughout his career in the 80's and early 90's.</p>
<p><br />
I believe that similar deceptive statures can be found with the wrestler, Paul Wight AKA Big Show. He's billed as 7'2, But his University listed him at 6'11. I say, that the 2 inch heals and inch of hair probably made him appear 7'2. Paul does weigh a legitimate weight of 493 lbs.</p>
<p>--63.224.226.148 03:34, 20 February 2006 (UTC) Andre the Giant and the not as famous Big Show, are both 6 ft 10 guys who, from a combination of ego and big healed boots, elevated themselves to the status of 7ft 4 giants.</p>
<p>Bare in mind, their grotesqely endowed proportions and hulking countenances made them appear all the more like a classic Medieval Ogre, or some sort of beastly giant from the Cornwalish balads of old Britain.</p>
<p>Evidently, in both cases, these men's collective bulk, truly gave them the impression of being ever more taller and "giant like" than say, your average NBA Center or Forward.</p>
<p>It wasn't ego that made them increase their height, but the wrestling business, everyone does it, from Kurt Angle to Big Show.</p>
<p>I have just looked at pic of Andre and Vince McMohan together and Andre looks like he's a foot taller than Vince or evan taller</p>
<p>Two things. The first is on Andre's A&amp;E documentary, Tim White said that by the time he died, his waist swelled to 500 pounds and what in considerable pain.</p>
<p>Secondly, I heard a rumor that he used lifts in his boots to make him taller. Can anyone verify if this is true?<br />

<p>Whoever said Andre towered over Big John Studd apparently never saw their Wrestlemania match. They were nearly the same height. As for Andre continuing to grow throughout his life, that's pure rubbish, as he obviously began losing height in his 30's.</p>
<p>The article talks about Andre being easy to work with and protective of his opponent in the ring. Why then do so many big wrestlers (such as Hogan on his DVD) talk about Andre beating them to within an inch of their life? Andre was not easy to work with at all in the match because he was always protective of his spot against big men until they earned his respect. (Take a look at how he treats Studd in the aforementioned Wrestlemania match sometime.)</p>
<p><b>Response</b></p>
<p>When a professional wrestler is in front of a camera regarding just about anything, particularly something to do with wrestling, they're in character most of the time. Hogan, for instance, is not going to say that Andre hit like a girl or something. Wrestlers have to keep up the illusion of it all. Andre was a very gentle person, by all accounts, and was truly worried about just using anything close to his full strength. Andre never lifted weights a day in his life, to my knowledge, yet he was one of the physically strongest men to ever step into a wrestling ring. So yeah, he tried to be as careful as he possibly could be, even though it hurt his ring work substantially at times. Most wrestlers are quite protective of their spots, it's certainly not unusual. Hulk Hogan, Triple H, Shawn Michaels, Ric Flair, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, etc. are all notorious for protecting their spots to the point that it became a detrement for them to do so, but they had too much pull. It was sort of the same for Andre, which is partially why Andre held very few major titles in pro wrestling. Andre was extremely picky, more so than probably anyone, as to who he would job to, Hulk Hogan was one of the very few that wrestling fans would even accept or believe Andre would job to in the first place. The whole Hulk Hogan persona was something that seemed as if it belonged in a comic book during the 1950's and that's part of what made it so appealing. Hulk Hogan, during physical peak, was seen as a type of superhero really. Who, accept a "superhero", are fans going to believe can beat a "giant"?</p>
<p><b>Rebuttal</b></p>
<p>I'm sure Andre was a very gentle person in day to day life, but by all accounts he worked stiff in the ring. That is, he really gave some good beatings. Those are comments from wrestlers out of character.</p>
<p>The article also states that Andre's undefeated streak was a fictiond designed to sell Wrestlemania III. Not true. Certainly Andre was not undefeated by 1987, but the idea of him being undefeated came about as far back as the early 80's and is mentioned in the sports illustrated article (1981 I believe?) It was not something created soley for Wrestlemania III as the author assumes.</p>
<p>Article states how the Silverdome only holds 80,000... but in wrestling you can have more fans than a football game because of all the room on the field. You only need to set up a wrestling ring. Regardless, I agree there were not 93,000 there, and the Wrestlemania III article discusses this subject well.</p>
<p>Finally, the article suggests Andre's death was this inevitable thing because of his size. "Andre was always told by doctors that he was basically living on borrowed time after the age of 30." Apparantly drinking and smoking for twenty years like there was no tomorrow had nothing to do with it?</p>

<p>I'm a Andre's nephew&#160;: Samuel Beckett had a house on the the way to go to Andre's school. A very small house were he wrotte his novels.

Andre went to school every day by foot with his brother Antoine and sisters Helene and Mauricette. Jack was too young to go to school.

<p>The A&amp;E biography claims that André was measured at the age of 22 by a doctor in Japan. André did not go to Japan until January 1970 at the age of 24. It also claims his smaller stature later in life was due to an operation in 1983 while Sportswriters had been saying his height was 6'10" 7 years before that.

<p>on the page, there's a note that the stated crowd of 93,000+ can not be true because that exceeds the silverdome's listed capacity of 80,311. this is not necessarily true, the 80k figure is based on the stadium's permanent seating only, it does not reflect the additional seating added for events such as wrestling and concerts, which would indeed add a significan amount of seats. i'm not going to dispute that the actual crowd figure was likely NOT 93k as reported, but the reasoning used on this page are in error, and perhaps a simple note that the attendance figure is disputed(as appears on the wrestlemania 3 page proper) would be more appropriate? <a href="../../../p/e/l/User%7EPelzo63_6c3d.html" title="User:Pelzo63">Pelzo</a> 05:58, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Andre is not 6'10. Look at Hulk Hogan who's 6'5. Andre is taller than him which means he has to be at least 7'2 or 7'5. Saying he's 6'10 is like saying he's Kane's size which he's not.</p>

<dd>Whoops, my bad about the Giant Haystacks thing. I do have a photo of one their matches but it was taken during an Irish whip, so both men are bent forward. A face to face picture might be difficult to find for it's likely promoters probably didn't like magazines taking pictures like that because it may have shown that Andre was not as tall as he was billed. Looking at some of the photos of Big Daddy and Giant Haystacks, it looks like Giant Haystacks is around 6' 8", but of course, I'm not the best at this and comparing with suspect wrestling heights is a bit of a problem.--<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarren_Jowalsen_31c2.html" title="User:Darren Jowalsen">Darren Jowalsen</a> 03:24, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yeh mabbe, diff to tell with Haystacks, and ppl of such extreme size. There is a good pic that I put on his talk page. I tried to find a pic of him when he was billed as The Loch Ness monster and took on Hogan in the mid 90's, but have not found one. It would be a good match because we know Hogan's legit height.(<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalbared_d043.html" title="User:Halbared">Halbared</a> 10:11, 5 July 2006 (UTC))</dd>

<dd>Think about this, gigantism leads it's victim to being over 7 ft tall so why would Andre the Giant be only 6'10? Saying he's 6'10 is like saying he's as tall as Kane which he's not. Also, you're implying that the Great Khali is the tallest wrestler to ever grace a WWE ring whereas Andre has always been stated to be the tallest wrestler in the WWE and Khali has yet to be called so. He's 7'4-7'7, live with it.</dd>

<p>Gigantism doesn't necessarily mean you'll be seven feet tall, and I think you're forgetting about Giant Gonzales (legit 7ft 6") billed as 7ft 7" or "near to 8ft", he's the tallest ever in a WWE/WWF ring.</p>

<dd>I don't know where you are getting this information. Not every person with gigantism is over 7 feet tall. If you observe the matches with Hulk Hogan and Andre and then watch the Hogan vs. Paul Wight matches, you can clearly see the difference in height. Some might say this is from the back surgery but people do not lose six inches in back surgery. Given the information above from Dave Meltzer, you are suggesting that between 1970 and 1990, Andre grew and shrank 6 if not more inches? I find that highly unlikely. On the Great Khali, perhaps the WWE doesn't wish to harm the mystique of Andre? Plus, wrestling announcers are not exactly known for historical consistency.--<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarren_Jowalsen_31c2.html" title="User:Darren Jowalsen">Darren Jowalsen</a> 04:46, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would think that they prolly do want to keep the 'mystique'. Giant Gonzales was simply hailed as being 8 ft tall (after his early introductions which put him at 'near' 8 ft). Which is the 6 inch addition that would keep him in line with Andre.(<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalbared_d043.html" title="User:Halbared">Halbared</a> 10:11, 5 July 2006 (UTC))</dd>

<dd>I think that he's got to be somehwere from 6'11 to 7'1, after looking at him wrestle, he isn't anywhere near 7'4 or 7'6. Gonzales was 7'6 so he's the largest wrestler ever but Andre is at least 7 ft. Just to settle the argument, let's just change his height from ranging from 6'10 to 7'2. I mean, we'll never know for sure as we're not Andre himself or any of his doctors.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 207.69.137.20 (<a href="../../../2/0/7/User_talk%7E207.69.137.20.html" title="User talk:207.69.137.20">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__207.69.137.20_a161.html" title="Special:Contributions/ 207.69.137.20">contribs</a>) 9-7-2006 06:28:25 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p>The truth of these "height talks": I am 6'3". I have meet numerous wrestlers in my day, including many of the so-called "giants" of wrestling. Khali is above 7 feet, and El Gigante/Giant Gonzales was 7'6" legit. I met Andre during the early 80's when he had his big puffy hair, and I will say for a fact that he was not 7 feet, unless you included his hair puffiness. Hogan is 6'5" legit, not 6'8". Sid Vicious is 6'6", Kane is about 6'7" legit, Undertaker is about 6'8", Nash 6'9 1/2". Please remember that wrestler heights are often exaggerated. I saw Roddy Piper listed at 6'2" one time, and when I met him he was about 5'10". Hogan is nowhere close to 6'8", despite WWE claims. When he fought Brock Lesnar, they were the same height, and Lesnar is 6'5". The bottom line... Andre was about 6'10" at his tallest.</p>
<p>Lesnar is 6'3. Anyway, Andre was definitely only about 6'10. At the most he was a staggering 6'10 but nothing more. You can just look at him &amp; tell that he's not 7 ft. Especially when he was up against a 6'5 Hulk Hogan. <a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESon_of_Kong_5a1b.html" title="User:Son of Kong">Son of Kong</a></p>

<p>Right, Im gonna get straight to the point... There is someone on Wikipedia that keeps changing Andre the Giant's height to 6ft 10in. For some god only knows reason he believes this to be true even though his own official site credits him as being 7ft 5in and recorded at Wrestlemania III to be that height (at the age of 41, died aged 45). Andre was measured at the age of 24 to be 6ft 10in, but he had gigantism which meant he continued to grow till he died so by Mania III it is very strongly possible that he was 7ft 5in. I was informed by this nobody that I had to consult the discussion page firt, so I am. But until I have been shown a link to some visable information post his age 24 measurement of him being 6ft 10in I will continue to change it to his Official height. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignick666_ea5b.html" title="User:Bignick666">User:Bignick666</a></p>
<p>I am going to have to agree, but the site says 7 feet four inches. "At 7'4" and 500 pounds, Andre the Giant could have been famous for his size alone. His drive, talent and ambition, however, proved to be as big as Andre himself, and the wrestler became legendary for his achievements in and out of the ring." - <a href="http://www.andrethegiant.com/bio.html" class="external free" title="http://www.andrethegiant.com/bio.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.andrethegiant.com/bio.html</a> ---<a href="../../../j/o/w/User%7EJowan2005_8d52.html" title="User:Jowan2005">Jowan2005</a> People with gigantism do not grow pass puberty, that is a common misconception. If you read the further up on the page, you will see the arguements for the six foot ten estimate. It may be on his official webpage, but that doesn't mean it's an undeniable fact. His fictional height was a big part of his mystique and I can see why they would use the kayfabe height. When it comes to wrestling, "official" doesn't necessarily mean "reliable."</p>

<p>For starters this research was months in the making and accurate.Andre was measured legitimately by a trainer at 7 feet 1.5 inches tall.The only person who ever said Andre was Legitimately measured at 6 feet 9.5 inches tall is Dave Meltzer(who was about 13 years old at the time of the alledged measurment) but nobody knows when where how or by whom the story just came from nowhere and noone.Also in his very same book he has Andre at a Legitimate 6 feet 11.5 inches in a picture with Wilt Chamberlin and Arnold.Yet in the picture Wilt is wearing a wig and staing straight up with his chest pushing out and Andre is slouching forward.Wilt at first looks a little taller because of the wig but if you look close enough the top of Andre's forhead is a little higher than Wilt's and if Andre stands straight like Wilt is standing Andre is taller but if you take boots into consideration they are about the same height.Wilt also has longer legs than Andre which puts his body a little taller than Andre's body but by the time you get to the top of Andre's massive head its very close considering Andre's head is about 4 iches longer than a normal head if not more.This picture was taken inn 1984 well after Andre had lost 3 inches in height from back and ankle surgery and more surgery's followed.Andre was 6 feet 10 inches at death so how could anyone possibly say he was never 7 feet .The only report of him being under 7 feet is a guy trying to sell books by creating contorversy . Check out the website giantsandgirls and oldschoolwrestling with pictures proving he was much taller in late 60's through 70's and if he's 6 feet 10 inches in his WWF final run then he's at least 7 feet 1 inches or even 7 feet 2 inches.Cashisclay 22:20, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

So why doesn't this site use the facts instead of some non proven article by Dave Meltzer.If it was true then who measured him? how ?where? It was just gossip after all that what Meltzer does is gossip about wrestlers.

There is one with Bob Backlund who's NCAA measured height is 6 feet 1 inches tall and Andre stands at least a foot or more over Backlund.You can look at Andre in 1969 at oldschoolwrestling.com these pictures prove he was over 7 feet also giantsandgirls.com these also back up my theory and there are several other sites with more. Andre in these pictures is easily 3 inches taller than in his WWF run where he lost height to back and ankle surgery's and his slouched over posture.</p>

<dd>Everything you have said about Meltzer can be said about this supposed trainer. Andre also did very little if any physical training his entire career (maybe for his movies but not on his own). Meltzer will always note what is hearsay and generally says who told him such. He made no distinction here so I'm guessing he has something tangible. The giantsandgirls.com doesn't work since we have no heights on those girls and can not make valid comparisons.

<p>Wrestling journalist, Mike Mooneyham, claims Andre topped out at 7-2. Lord Alfred said Andre was 6'10" when he first met him as a teenager. Alfred then said "who could imagine that he would grow almost another foot taller," or words to that effect. That clip was from the Tuesday Night Titans (TNT) show the WWE used to have on the USA Network and it was Andre's Manager who took the 7' 1.5 measurement which would be more credible because he was closer to Andre and would have access to do so. Also Andre's brother tells of Andre having to stick his head out of the roof of the car to drive it because he was over 7 feet tall in the A&amp;E Biography. The only claim of 6 9 is Meltzer. Keep in mind,Meltzer makes a living off of wrestling rumors and his supposed insider knowledege...but consider this:</p>
<p>1) He certainly wasn't present for this "official measurement." 2) The whole camp of guys who surrounded Andre were old school types who never broke kayfabe. Does anyone seriously believe they'd open up to some geeky dirt sheet writer, especially regarding Andre, who is such a beloved figure? 3)Finally, Melzer's own self-contradiction. Even in his Tributes book, he admits Andre may possibly have reached 6-11...and yet in the pic with Wilt he pegs Andre at 6-11.5. In other words, the main source of this 6-9.75 estimate does not and has never consistently held to it. Why in the world should we, especially in light of the fact that we have no books to sell.</p>

<dd>Meltzer only said in his first book that Andre was at most 6 foot 11. In his second book he cited the measurement. I have gone over the Wilt Chamberlain photo quite thoroughly before, if you cared to read the earlier arguements. Yes he did print the photo in his newsletter in 1984 but that's one photo. Meltzer compiled other information as well. Chuck Wepner said when he fought Andre in 77, he told reporters that Andre was 6'9" and he didn't make his living off of rumours for dirtsheets. When legitimate sportswriters would report on Andre and when other athletes like basketball players saw him, they all said he was around 6'9" to 6'10". He thought he was taller before and then changed his mind later when he took in all the evidence. Sounds perfectly fine to me.</dd>

<dd>If anything, the main selling point of the first book was the Owen Hart obituary, not some sort of controversy over Andre's real height. Like I said before, many people already knew he really wasn't over seven feet tall, through the whole article he tried to peel off the legends and the kayfabe and reveal the real almost tragic person. The fact that Meltzer was not personally involved makes it more likely that he would not try to keep kayfabe and say the truth. This, "He did it to sell books" doesn't really makes sense since the book had no publicity and the Wrestling Observer is not meant for the casual fans one would be trying to attract with a sensationalist story. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarren_Jowalsen_31c2.html" title="User:Darren Jowalsen">Darren Jowalsen</a> 05:06, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How could anyone possibly say that Andre was the same height in 1969 that he was at Wrestlemania 3 . They must need glasses. Look at the pictures they don't lie if he was 6' 10 at Wrestlemania 3 then he was at least 7' 1 in 1969 or early 1970's. People lose height with age its a fact of life. Also Andre had several surgery's on his back and ankle which would cause him to lose height and the fact that he slouched more later in life due to excessive growth. The pictures are there compare them with others and see the height difference from the 1960's or 1970's than the late eighties it's a pretty significant difference . Also notice that Andre is well over a foot taller than everybody else in all the pictures. Out of all of them people someone has gotta be at least 6 feet tall. I proved my comments I provided the links but noone else seemed to have proved there's by going by hearsy and half-truths. You say sport writers who when where.Show the links that prove otherwise. It never happened. The only account of the 6 10 measurement is talk and there is no proof of the measurement ever taking place. Andre would never let someone measure him if he was under 7 feet tall it would ruin his career. Someone started the rumors backstage because Andre was being billed as 7' 4 or 7' 5 when he really was 7' 1.5 . Andre was over 7 feet the proof is there to view.Cashisclay 06:01, 4 October 2006 (UTC) 05:55, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If Andre died at the age of 46 yrs and weighed over 500 lbs and measured 6ft 10 at death, he was most likely an inch or two taller as a young man without as much weight and spinal compression. I bet Andre was a true Seven footer in his 20's and 30's as all indications seem to show.</p>
<div style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; margin-left: 1em;"></div>
IT SHOWS ON THIS VERY SITE UNDER "LIST OF FAMOUS TALLEST MEN" THAT ANDRE WAS 7 FEET SO IT SHOULD SAY 7 FEET ON HIS PAGE

LOOK AT THE PHOTOS LISTED ABOVE THEY SHOW A MUCH TALLER NON SLOUCHED OVER VERSION OF ANDRE . THERE IS NO WAY ANYONE CAN SAY HE IS NOT TALLER IN THESE PICTURES THAN IN THE WRESTLEMANIA ERA WHEN ANYONE CAN SEE THE NOTICABLE HEIGHT DIFFERENCE. THIS PAGE SHOULD READ 7' 1 AS PEAK HEIGHT 6' 10 WWF ERA. THE ONLY THING PEOPLE SEEM TO BE GOING BY IS AN ALLEDGED MEASUREMENT . WHERE'S THE PROOF THIS MEASUREMENT TOOK PLACE . THERE IS NONE . IT DID NOT TAKE PLACE . THEREFORE IT IS HEARSAY. OTHER WRESTLING JOURNALISTS PEGGED HIM AT 7' 1 OR 7' 2 SUCH AS MIKE MOONEYHAM WHICH IS STATED ABOVE. THESE SOURCES ARE JUST AS LEGIT AS MELTZER. WHAT JUST BECAUSE IT WAS ALLEDGED IN A MELTZER'S BOOK. THERE IS NO PROOF IT EVER ACTUALLY TOOK PLACE. IF SO PROVE IT OR CHANGE THE PAGE TO A PEAK HEIGHT OF AT LEAST 7' OR 7' 1.5. ONE PERSON ALLEDGED THIS MEASUREMENT AND MANY OTHERS SAY HE WAS OVER 7' FEET I PROVED OTHERS WHO KNEW ANDRE SAID HE WAS OVER 7 FEET AND HIS MANAGER DID MEASURE HIM AT 7' 1.5 IN THE 1970'S WHICH HE STATED IN AN INTERVIEW. I PROVED MY POINT I PROVIDED THE INFORMATION WHICH CAME DIRECTLY FROM PEOPLE CLOSE TO ANDRE AND THE PICTURES ARE THERE ABOVE FOR ALL TO VIEW. HE WAS FOR SURE OVER 7 FEET TALL...Cashisclay 20:23, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have yet to see any citation for that manager quote. It's obvious we aren't going to reach a consensus here. So, how a bout we do what I was thinking about a while before where we have a section that discusses what his height is and we have both sides.

<p>HERE IS SOME PROOF THAT ANDRE WAS TALLER THAN THE BIG SHOW WHO IS LISTED AS 7 FEET TALL ON THIS SITE.</p>
<p>From Jim Duggan shoot interview;</p>
<p>Wrestling Andre the Giant- He first wrestled him in Hawaii. Great guy. If Andre didn’t like you, it wasn’t a good thing. “Paul Wight, The Giant, is a big, well proportioned, man. Andre was a GIANT.</p>

<p>Another shoot interview with Bobby Heenan;</p>
<p><br />
Steveski asked for Heenan’s thoughts on Andre The Giant. Heenan said that Andre was a huge attraction, being all of the 7 foot 5 inches that the WWF said he was. Steveski then asked about the Big Show, in so much as wondering why the Big Show isn’t as big a star. Heenan referenced Andre, saying that everybody feared Andre. Concerning the Big Show, Heenan said that Wight is just another big guy. Furthermore, Heenan said that when Andre went to an airport, all eyes were on him the whole time. With Paul Wight, not as many people notice him.Cashisclay 05:19, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Here is a cite and proof that Andre was over 7 feet tall at his peak height. Wrestling Journalist Mike Mooneyham who is a very respected by his readers and a very experienced journalist cites that Andre was 7 feet 2 inches at his peak. Also he was not trying to sell books when he made this quote like Meltzer was which makes his claim more legitimate. He is not protecting Kayfabe. This is how he makes his living which makes it more legit. He states that Andre who was being billed at 7'4 or 7'5 was really 7'2. Andre's height now should be changed to 7 feet 2 inches for peak height or at least the 7 feet 1.5 inches that his manager stated to have measured him at. The proof is here now the height should be changed due to overwhelming facts. There are more facts leading to 7'1 or 7'2 at his peak than anything else and this site is supposed to be based on facts. <a href="http://www.mikemooneyham.com/pages/viewfull.cfm?ObjectID=C3BAC431-2ED0-4320-9135E00CBA51350C" class="external free" title="http://www.mikemooneyham.com/pages/viewfull.cfm?ObjectID=C3BAC431-2ED0-4320-9135E00CBA51350C" rel="nofollow">http://www.mikemooneyham.com/pages/viewfull.cfm?ObjectID=C3BAC431-2ED0-4320-9135E00CBA51350C</a>Cashisclay 04:30, 18 October 2006 (UTC) Cashisclay 04:25, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Meltzer would never print something he didn't believe himself without making it clear to the reader he didn't believe it. There was really no scandal he was trying to push with saying Andre was 6'10", Chuck Wepner was telling that to people in the late seventies. Both Mooneyham and Meltzer make their money reporting on wrestling, I see no reason why Mooneyham trumps Meltzer. Both sides of the story should go into the article. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarren_Jowalsen_31c2.html" title="User:Darren Jowalsen">Darren Jowalsen</a> 05:13, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There has been much speculation and debate over the true height of Andre. Jim Duggan and Bobby Heenan maintain that his kayfabe height was correct. <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Meltzer_f6dc.html" title="Dave Meltzer">Dave Meltzer</a>, a wrestling journalist wrote in his book <i>Tributes</i> that <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuck_Wepner_8074.html" title="Chuck Wepner">Chuck Wepner</a>, who faced Andre in a boxer vs. wrestler match in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a> told reporters Andre was 6 ft 10 in. In Meltzer's second book, <i>Tributes II</i>, Meltzer claims Andre was measured at 6 ft 9 3/4 in 1974, at the age of twenty-four. Mike Mooneyham, another wrestling journalist maintained in his obituary of Andre in 1994 that Andre was 7 ft 2 in at his peak.</dd>

This is starting to sound better. In the statistics portion it should state 7' 2 peak and 6' 10 wwf era. Also it should mention the manager quote. He lost height later in life due to back surgeries slouching and curving of his spine due to excessive weight gain which was very noticable. If he was 6' 10 at Wrestlemania 3 than he was well over 7 feet at his peak height. Don't forget that Meltzer condradicted himself by saying that Andre was 6' 11.5 in the 1984 Wilt picture while Mooneyham stayed with his word. Meltzer is also known for just printing anything and has had some wrestlers call him on it. Who's to say Meltzer's source is legit. Maybe someone told him wrongful information it has happened before. So it should state in statistics 7'2 peak and 6'10 wwf era would be the most legit way to say it. Also Lord Alfred Hayes stated that Andre was well over 7'feet tall in the A&amp;E Biography as well as Andre's brother and other wrestlers have all stated he was over 7 feet tall.Cashisclay 06:36, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You know, you can stick with the wrong word sometimes ;). I've said all I wanted to say about Meltzer, I trust him on this, that is not to say I trust with everything, especially not Lucha information. Just find some citations on those other guys and we'll put them in. I've been wanting to really revamp this article and possibly get it up to good article standards and getting more citations on this page is a step in the right direction.<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarren_Jowalsen_31c2.html" title="User:Darren Jowalsen">Darren Jowalsen</a> 15:00, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So far nothing has been shown to show Andre over 7 feet. The manager quote so far is unsubstantiated. There is no evidence that Andre lost more than 3 inches in height, the pic from the Conan film shows him standing quite straight at a time where me may have weighed 450 lb. Meltzer also does not contradict himself. He states that Andre could have been 6 ft 11 in in the Conan pic, but the only time that Andre was measured for certain was in 1970. This is not a contradiction but an acknowledgement that he was only measured medically once as far as we know. Melzter is an investigative reporter who has spent I think 30 years in the business trying to find the facts behind the wrestlers kayfabe, not to mention that also the sports commentators also viewed Andre at not more than 6 ft 10 in during the Wepner fight. Personally Darren I would leave it unless some new evidence comes up.<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalbared_d043.html" title="User:Halbared">Halbared</a> 18:27, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

There has for sure been new evidence brought to this site and it is cited to view yourselves. If we are trying to get the facts straight it all has to be mentioned and statistics should read 7' 2 peak and 6' 10 WWF era and all stories should be mentioned There is alot of talk yet noone else is proving anything. I have already cited several people on the over 7 ' quote but you have not provided any except for the Meltzer quote and how can you possibly say he doesn't contradict himself when he states two different heights and lets not forget he rounded down Wilt's height just so he didn't have to say Andre was 7' feet tall and Andre is not standing as straight as Wilt. Andre's slouches forward a bit and Wilt is standing straight with his chest sticking outward.Wilt looks a little taller because he has longer legs by the time you reach the top of their heads there ain't much difference and Wilt is wearing a huge wig and this photo is 1984 Andre had already visibly lost some height. There is more proof here towards the 7' plus claim than the one 6' 10 quote that was contradicted by Meltzer himself and was never proven and to say Andre never visibly lost height is just not true. The pics of a younger Andre show a taller Andre. It is also a known fact that you lose height with age and add the surgey's and slouching and curving of the spine because of excesssive weight gain and he would be taller before all this. If your spine is curving how could you possibly not lose height especially when alot of Andre's height was in his upper body. My father was 6'3 now he is only 6'0 and that's a doctors measurement. If you think otherwise you are being totally skeptical. Also what makes your claim any more legit than the ones I cited. Mike Mooneyham had nothing to gain by this quote and he has access to the same info as Meltzer and if he had heard about this measurement he would have published it himself because he also has been around a long time and makes a living off these types of things. Also the wrestlers themselves state that Andre was taller than the Big Show who is 7 feet tall and these facts are cited above and any more I get I will add . As for the Wepnar fight Andre dwarfs Wepnar even Wepnar's manager said that Andre made Wepnar a big man to in his eyes look like a baby. Andre has at least 6 or 7 inches on the 6'6 Wepnar. Finally how would Meltzer get this information when medical records are completly confidential which makes this sound more and more like a backstage rumour and not at all credible. There is no way he could get that information from a doctor and I'm certain Andre didn't quote this so where is the proof. The page should say he was allegedly measured not legitimately because a doctor can't release that kind of infomation which makes it second hand news. SHOW THE PROOF OR CHANGE THE PEAK HEIGHT.Cashisclay 19:32, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nothing has been shown yet, to show Andre stood over 7 feet. The statistics shouldn't read 7 ft 2 in because that still rests on only one remark by a trainer, the origin of which is not known right now. Read what is written, it is not a contradiction to estimate someones height (which you yourself have done as well) and then to state the only time he was actually measured. I emailed Dave about this because I would like to know where the measurement came from. This was his full response. <b>He was measured in France legit for a match by a commission.</b> Not excessive in detail;o), but quite clear. Email yourself for your own answer.<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalbared_d043.html" title="User:Halbared">Halbared</a> 08:31, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Show the proof of this measurement. Doctors or a commission can not release that type of information and especially not to a dirt sheet writer. Mike Mooneyham stated he was about 7' 2 his word is just as good as Meltzer's. SO Meltzer's information had to be second hand news. I also provided facts that wrestlers stated in shoot interviews that Andre was taller than the Big Show and they have no reason to lie especially Jim Duggan who has worked with both of them. You are supposed to go by the facts and your facts are very tainted and it seems you don't know much about the wrestling buisness at all. I provided several cited facts to back up my stance but you provide nothing and even in light of news facts that are backed up you continue to talk about something that Meltzer had no way of obtaining first hand. This is why alot of people don't think this site's information is very credible. I provided proof and you have provided nothing. Did you even read the cited articles. I guess not. Also Darren is planning on changing the article due to the new cited facts but Halbared keeps changing back it and he don't even know nothing about the account. I've done much research on this matter and provided new facts and I believe the article should be changed to tell the whole story.Cashisclay 16:42, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Melzter at the time was a published author, had been for years. Also there is the other evidence such as the similar height To Bigcat and the attention of legit sports writers from the 70's. Ppl who did not need to protect kafaybe. The facts aren't tainted, you just find them awkward and don't like them because they show Andre to be shorter than his billed height. Which was very normal for wrestlers back then. A good example is Blackjack Lanza who admits to being 6 ft 4 in, but was billed at 6 ft 9 in. The quote's origin remains dubious, is it on the Moonyham site? Where is it's citation? We still have as well as the measurement, the comments of legit sports writers, the fights with Big Cat etc.<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalbared_d043.html" title="User:Halbared">Halbared</a> 08:39, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
For starters it is on Mike Mooneyham's site and it is also cited on this very talk page. Also read the Jim Duggan shoot which is also cited on this page he is not protecting Kayfabe and he has worked with both Big Show and Andre and still works with Big Show to this day. The Big Show himself said Andre was taller. Also noone is saying Andre was the billed 7'4 or 7'5 but he was 7'1.5 which is a few inches off and about right. They usually add 2 to 3 inches and the reason they stayed with it at WrestleMania era even though he was only about 6'10 or 6'11 is that they couldn't say their Giant was shrinking or not healthy it would be bad for buisness and they were still trying to protect Kayfabe. You say sports writers than who? Any sports writer epecially at this time is going to say negative things about a wrestlers especially the NBA writers who are trying to promote their own guys. You still provide no proof. Look at the cake photos cited on this page or the photo with Bobby Hull who is a legit 5' 10 and Andre has him by 15 inches boots and shoes accounted for. Also these pictures are the best ones because they are taken on a regular camera straight on. Any photo taken in the ring can be deceiving because of standing positions and angles and the same goes for video. These photos are early 1970's and the best ones out there of Andre. Also in the cake photo with all the guys one of them guys is listed at 6' 1. I continue to show proof of a taller Andre if he was 6' 10 at Wrestlemania 3 than he is well over 7 feet in these photos.</p>
<dl>
<dd>A 'citation' is 'a word or piece of writing taken from a written work' This page does not qualify. I am trying to access the Mooneyham site, I succeded once (not from ur link) but could not find the quote, tho I will keep trying. The 'Myth of Andre' is something that is protected in wrestling circles, tho I am not disputing what Duggan said. What Big Show say's is irrelavent since he nver met Andre. How do you know 'a few inches off is aboot right'? It was not unheard of for wrestlers to have 5 inches or more added. Big John Studd, a legit 6 ft 7 in was billed at 7 ft in the early 80's, Hogan was billed at 6 ft 9 etc. The photos you show are not proof. The Wilt pic is good, but don't try and say that Wilt is standing straight and Andre is not, that is clearly not nthe case. Andre to me looks to be standing quite straight. I doubt fixing an ankle would rob him of any height then. And as far as I am aware, the only time Andre had back surgery was in laet '86. Not before Conan. Unless you have some other time he has had it?<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalbared_d043.html" title="User:Halbared">Halbared</a> 13:21, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Listen good Andre had Ankle surgery and one Back surgery before this photo was taken. All of the links below I have tested and they work perfect. You talk alot but you prove nothing. You say sportwriters well I linked the 1981 sports Illustrated tribute to Andre and they state over 7 feet tall. I linked the Wepnar video below so you can hear Wepnar's managers quotes about how Andre made Wepnar look like a baby and was dwarfed along side of Andre and at least he was there for the fight watching it in person at ringside. Big John Studd was billed at 6'10 not 7 feet tall and Hulk Hogan states in his dvd that he was 6'7 at his peak but is now 6'4 because of surgeries and age and that Andre was a half a foot taller than him then and this wasn't even Andre's peak height it was at the later part of Andre's life. Andre's body was breaking down on him from the 1980's on. Remember his head, hands, feet, and chest never stopped growing and he continued to gain weight. He could barely move around the ring or get up from the canvas by this time. You are going by hearsy I am providing new information to this site. This is the same thing as a citation it is from a piece of written work from Mike Mooneyham as well as others. What you are saying is just because Meltzer said it it or put it in his book makes it true. I think not considering how he makes a living. I am just providing facts. Why don't you stop talking and prove something oh that's right you have no proof. All of your claims you have not proved so they are hearsay. The only thing your going by is one quote by someone who has contradicted himself on this very subject anything else you say is just talk or hearsay. At least I've provided actual quotes and articles. Finally you do need glasses if you say that Andre is not slouching in the Wilt picture and Wilt is not standing straight up. Andre always slouched by this time due to excessive weight gain. All the links listed below are legit and work fine I tried them myself. Why don't you just take the time to look at them and the quotes because you are not proving anthing by just talking and being skeptical. They show a taller Andre who stands straight not slouched and they are before any of his surgeries. There is an overwhelming amount of evidence listed below to confirm he was over 7 feet tall at his peak.Cashisclay 22:00, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>When did he have his first back sugery? The ankle surgey is quite well known. I have seen the Wepnar vid. Wepnar is dowm as being less that 6 ft 6 in. At the moment, we have one sports writer stating he was measured at a certain height at a very young age, and another one saying something different, so with this in kind you cannot state he was the taller height, we can merely say that these two writers have different opinions, which is what is not said in the main body of the article. Big John was billed at both 7 feet and 6 ft 10 in in his career. Hogan states he was 6 ft 7 in prolly to hide the fact that he had such a huge billed back in the 70's. Hogan was not the most truthful in his autobiog and maintained a good defence of his actions over the years. I am not going of hearsay. I am going off the cited information and pictures. Melzter is no less valid than Mooneyham just because his evidence conflicts with urs. Andre isn't slouched in that pic, I would advise spectacles yourself.:oD Regardless, since we have co0nflicting evidence, the comnpromise is to present it both as claims, which we have compromised on, however to state he really was 7 ft 2 in would be incongruous.<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalbared_d043.html" title="User:Halbared">Halbared</a> 08:49, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well if to state that he was 7'2 would incongruos then to state he was 6' 10 would be the same thing. We both have info backing up both claims because really that's all they are is claims unless we measured him ourselves or had some sold evidence of him being measured which will never be found. The height should state 7'2 or at least over 7' and 6'10 WWF era. The fact Andre lost some height is very evident from pics and video and he was at least 6'10 or 6' 11 at Wrestlemania 3 so with the info below and the visual height loss Andre was over 7 feet in his prime years. The facts are provided here below just as you provided yours so the listing of both heights should be stated due to the facts provided.Cashisclay 03:27, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I am not stating he was merely 6 ft 10 in. Read what is written. The article claims that he <b>was at least</b> 6 ft 10 in. That is fact, to state anything else is supposition. And read this page. I myself think that he may have been as tall as 6 ft 11 ¾ in, as Melztler claims in his first book, this seems reasonable, but I did not arbitrarily change it BECAUSE IT IS NOT FACT! It is my opinion, and the only fact we have to go on is the fact that he <b>was at least</b> as tall as the lowest cited height. That's why Darren and myself have amended your edits. And did you know that Andre wrestled exclusively for the WWF in N America from the 70's? His whole US career is WWF era. Both heights are now in the article as 'claims', because that is what they are. And have you any more info on his first back surgery?<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalbared_d043.html" title="User:Halbared">Halbared</a> 08:38, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Well I was stating WWF not WWWF era. I know the history of the company. Here is another major contradiction from this alledged claim. Meltzer claims Andre was measured at 6 ft 9 ¾ in 1974 by a French athletic commission, at the age of twenty-four. Andre was not 24 in 1974 he was 28 he was born in 1946. Due the math and fix this. Also Andre began wrestling under the name Jean Ferre in Canada for Grand Prix Promotions in 1971. In a short time Andre went from the undercard to being a headlining name. By the time Andre had performed in front of 20,000 wrestling fans in Montreal, his legend had reached Vince McMahon, Sr. at the World Wide Wrestling Federation's (WWWF) headquarters. McMahon would forever alter Andre's life. In 1972, McMahon signed Andre to wrestle for the WWWF . So look at these facts why would a french commission even be measuring Andre in the first place. He was part of thw WWWF way before this 1974 date. There is no way Vince McMahon SR. would allow anyone to be measuring his wrestlers especially at a time when kayfabe was so protected. I know Andre travelled the world but Andre was wrestling full time in Canada, Us, and Japan in 1974 which makes it less likley for him to be wrestling in France in 1974. Meltzer's claim has totally fallen apart. He does not even have the age right. This claim should be taken out because there is false information in it. This site is not supposed to be the National Inquirer it is supposed to be based on as much fact as possible. Meltzer's claim is full of false information and should not be used in this article and you can't just change the age because that wouldn't be what he actually said and would not be FACT. Also in the Wilt photo he says Wilt is 7'.5 when Wilt is a measured 7'1 3/8 and he says Andre is 6'11.5. If you go by Wilt's real height this would put Andre over 7' by Meltzer himself.Cashisclay 10:38, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, the age thing was bad math on my part, Meltzer made no mention of his age, he only gave the year. Andre didn't make his first extensive North American tour until 1974 and did little traveling outside of Europe before that. It wasn't until after the Montreal territory collapsed that Vince McMahon Sr. became Andre's booker so he would have had no power to stop a French commission from measuring Andre. We've been over the picture about ten times already, I'm not going over it again. People's opinions can change over time. Meltzer thought it was a smoking gun but then took other sources and photographs into account and changed his mind.--<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarren_Jowalsen_31c2.html" title="User:Darren Jowalsen">Darren Jowalsen</a> 15:04, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well for starters you are going by false info because Andre left France in 1971 to wrestle in Montreal as Jean Ferre where he made a name for himself and lived there for a while. The cake photos show that he was in Montreal in 1972. He wrestled for Grand Prix Promotions. Read his Bio on his webpage it is all stated on there.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Andre signed with MacMahon in 1972 it is right on his website so he was MacMahon property as of 1972 and if you look at Maple Wrestling Page Andre was working alot with them alot from 1973 on usually with The Sheik. I think you pay too much attention to a dirt sheet writer who's claims are very contradited and skeptical and who you are showing favourtism for. This is supposed to be fact not hearsy. These are all facts so what are you talking about. You need to get the facts straight and stop going by hearsay or gossip.</p>

<p>The only thing you provided for proof on this whole page is the Meltzer theory which is contradicted by himself and is nothing more than creating controversy to sell a book. The more controversy the more books he sells and he is going to try to bring up all the dirt he can true or not. There is no proof to this claim and with all the facts out there and on this page it seems highly unlikely that this measurement ever took place. Your only evidence is very tainted to say the least and by the way Wilt Chamberlin is 7' 1 3/8 not 7'.5 as Meltzer listed. There is no proof stating Wilt was 7'.5. The proof states 7'1 3/8 which by Meltzer himself would put Andre over 7' tall as of 1984. The article should state that Meltzer has contradicted himself on this account because it's the truth and a fact. This is from the giant among us article in 1981. By all accounts, Andre's health is excellent. Until last spring, in fact, when he suffered a broken ankle, he had never been to a hospital. When he did check in, however, he caused his usual stir. This is proof that no doctor measured him 1974. Andre didn't like going to hospitals or have anyone examine him. So he would not of let this measurement happen.</p>

<dd>All we are doing is going around in circles. Both sides strongly believe what they believe and when this happens, the optimal outcome is a compromise. A compromise was struck, both sides are in the articles with no preferential treatment for one or another. Remember, it's verifiablity, not necessarily truth that is important in Wikipedia articles. The Meltzer statements are staying in since it is citeable and from a source that many people trust, even though you do not. This argument is not doing any good to anyone. There is nothing more to be said. We made a compromise and since all sides are cited, there is absolutely no reason for this discussion to continue. Some say Andre is 6'10", other say he was 7' or more. That's fair and neutral.<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarren_Jowalsen_31c2.html" title="User:Darren Jowalsen">Darren Jowalsen</a> 04:03, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Here is a complete list of Andre's matches from 1974 and NEVER ONCE did he wrestle in France. So this proves Meltzer's claim is WRONG.

<p>This is the Mike Mooneyham site and article.</p>
<p>Andre, who was born in Grenoble, France, and lived on a 200-acre ranch in Ellerbe, N.C., was born with acromegaly, a disorder marked by progressive enlargement of the head, face, hands, feet and chest due to excessive secretion of growth hormones. And although he was often billed as being 7-4 and 7-5, Andre was actually "only" 7-2 when he began his career and had leveled out to under seven feet tall in recent years.</p>

<p>Here is some more proof to prove Andre to be over 7 feet tall. Studd was wearing 4 inch lifts when he wrestled Andre.</p>
<p>Studd, who at 6-7 and 320 pounds was one of the sport's biggest men during an era when grapplers of that size were rare, was a frequent opponent for the late Andre The Giant (Andre Rousimoff). The 18-year veteran wore four-inch lifts in his boots to bolster his height and virtually stand eye to eye with Andre, who was billed as 7-4 but was actually closer to seven feet tall. <a href="http://www.mikemooneyham.com/pages/viewfull.cfm?ObjectID=5130D70C-B003-44A8-8BCBAE3854F0BB88" class="external free" title="http://www.mikemooneyham.com/pages/viewfull.cfm?ObjectID=5130D70C-B003-44A8-8BCBAE3854F0BB88" rel="nofollow">http://www.mikemooneyham.com/pages/viewfull.cfm?ObjectID=5130D70C-B003-44A8-8BCBAE3854F0BB88</a></p>

<p>This picture is from Dave Melzter himself 1984. Note that Wilt is really listed at 7'1 3/8 by the NBA and Andre is almost the same height by the time you factor the Wilt's wig and boots and Andre's boots. Andre in this photo is after having back and ankle surgeries and is not at his peek height as the other early photos clearly show and is slouching a bit while Wilt is standing straight up with his chest sticking out. Meltzer has him at 6'11.5 but only has Wilt at 7'0.5. Add the other 3/4 inch to both and Andre is over 7 feet tall and not even at his peak. Meltzer had no right to take an inch from Wilt's height. Wilt is over 7'1 so Andre is over 7'0. The proof is right before your eyes.</p>

The agreed version seems to keep getting an extra tag on line which was not agreed, contradicts some the citations and is POV. Firstly, Andre is on record as only having one back surgery. This was in 1986. He doesn't appear to look much different at WMIV than he does at WMII. Whether he does or not, his bios all agree he had only one. Now what is a <i>fact</i> is that Andre had never be anaesthetized before. This is shown in his bio when the London doctor did not know how much to use, Andre and Vince did not know and enjoyed telling the story of how they had to gauge his reaction of alcohol. I cannot imagine another back surgery taking place where Andre was not anaesthetized.:oD Then we have the POV line that Andre lost height due to bad posture. Which is also POV. For a long time the only citation was Meltzers, with Andre's height at 6 ft 10 in. Then another journalist was found with a height of 7 ft 1 in. Now both these journalists are given equal footing and treated fairly, as both reasonable things. To add the line aboot bad posture at a later date dismisses the first citation and supports the second, is not cited and is wish fulfilment on the part of those tho think Andre was bigger in his youth, it's best to stick with facts and citations here, as an encyclopaedia should.<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalbared_d043.html" title="User:Halbared">Halbared</a> 09:33, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

This is from a man who met Andre on 2 occassions and was obsessed with Andre's real height. This is some solid evidence of Andre's real peak height.</p>
<p>Look, everyone of you is waaay off. I personally have met Andre the Giant on two ocassions, once when I was 12 at Madison square garden, and once again when i was 22 in Lakeland FL. I was obsessed with wrestler's height's at the time, He gave me his autograph, and I asked him how tall he really was. He told me that he did not know for sure what his height was, but his personal handler knew, and I should ask him. His handler said that at age 24, Andre was legitamately measured at 7'1.5 ... and i believe him, because when i was 12, he had to duck to go through the 7 foot tall doorways in madison square garden. When i was 22, he was shorter, after having had two surgeries.. about 6'11. <a href="http://www.rateitall.com/reviewercomments.aspx?RI=9671389" class="external free" title="http://www.rateitall.com/reviewercomments.aspx?RI=9671389" rel="nofollow">http://www.rateitall.com/reviewercomments.aspx?RI=9671389</a></p>
<p><br />
Here in an interview with Andre the Giant he reveals his True peak height and his height later on in life.</p>
<p>Andre was cremated in france, even his ashes were twice the weight of average his coffin was 7.5 feet, In his later years, he admitted that he was never above 7'2" and that the billing of "7'4" " came from Jack Tunney and the WWF, he went on to say {due to the loss of bone mass from acromegaly, along with his excess weight and aging }"I am 6'10".</p>

Ok. to answer to the real peak height of Andre : It's impossible to give a real answer because I don't know his real height peak. The only thing I know that Andre tell us all the time that his height is 2,18 meters. That's it ! It's not important for Andre's article... --User:Roussimoff Boris Andre's Nephew.

<p>"When André was young, he could not fit on a normal school bus and had to be driven to school. As his parents were unable to afford a car of their own, his neighbor, famed playwright Samuel Beckett, drove him every day.[4]</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>As a child, André was referred to by his parents as Dédé (pronounced Day-day) and showed no signs of being the size that he would end up being."</p>

<p>Even at his tallest adult height, he could have easily ridden even a small European school bus. How are we supposed to believe he "couldn't fit into a school bus" as a child or teen? And what was he driven to school in? A car -- which is so much smaller than a bus? The bed of a pickup truck? Did he never ride in a car in his life? If he was driven to school, there could be another explanation, such as social discomfort. 208.103.180.154 07:58, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I removed the claim of Beckett ferrying Andre to "school everyday". Unless someone has a more robust source for this ( some actor telling amusing anecdotes in an interview, with absolutely zero corroborating sources, does not rise to the level of a 'reputable source') I strongly suggest we leave it out. It is an absolutely sensational claim, undoubtedly untrue ( or exaggerated in an extraordinary manner), and I'm amazed (and a tad embarrassed for WP) that it's stood as long as it has. <a href="../../../l/e/v/User%7ELevi_P._7191.html" title="User:Levi P.">Levi P.</a> 06:50, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What other robust source can there be? This was a personal story passed on by Andre to some of his fellow actors, which was then passed on in the DVD. <a href="http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=61912" class="external free" title="http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=61912" rel="nofollow">http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=61912</a> <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalbared_d043.html" title="User:Halbared">Halbared</a> 10:21, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure what you mean...any reputable source would due. The point is, if there isn't a "more robust" source, which it doesn't seem there is, then the "story" shouldn't go in. It's not encyclopedic. Frankly, it is just hearsay, hearsay about two dead people, one of whom is the greatest playwright of the 20th century. It has every earmark of an apocryphal story and zero evidence corroborating it. That actor is not a reputable source for biographical info of Beckett. If he had published this story in a reputable venue where there was editorial oversight, then there would be something to talk about. As it is, it's just him talking in an interview. And, separate from the issue of sourcing (which is my real concern), the story doesn't even make any sense! Not even factoring in that Beckett could be famously taciturn and stand-offish, are we to believe that Andre, who, according to reliable sources certainly was tall, but no "giant" when he was young, could not fit in a "bus" but could fit in Beckett's car?Andre's family has never seen fit to mention this absolutely fantastic story in interviews? Andre never saw fit to mention this in any interview, that he knew the greatest living writer, a living legend? The fact is, the only thing we know from reliable sources is that they happened to live in the same town. I think that is what the article should reflect.

<p>Here's another source for the Beckett story:</p>
<dl>
<dd>As the days in Cannes passed, I realized that in twenty-five years of screenwriting, I had worked with, obviously, a lot of American actors and their British counterparts. ...</dd>
<dd>But in all that time, only one Frenchman. <i>Monsieur</i> Rousimoff. Probably better known by his athletic tag, André the Giant. André played one of the four leads in <i>The Princess Bride</i>, Fezzik, the strongest man in the world. ...</dd>
<dd>He was a constant source of pleasure--and a constant surprise.</dd>
<dd>One day he asked us if we knew who Samuel Beckett was.</dd>
<dd>Being familiar with <i>Waiting for Godot</i>, we said we did. Then we asked why he asked.</dd>
<dd>It seemed that André was brought up in a tiny town, population maybe thirty. And one of the other thirty was Beckett himself. When André was young, sometimes when he walked to school, Beckett would stop and give him a lift.</dd>

<p>Note that in this version, Andre did not claim that he couldn't fit in the bus, or even that there was a bus, or that Samuel Beckett drove him to school every day, just that Beckett "sometimes" gave him a ride to school, which I think we can accept as realistic. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 07:01, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>When Andre was young, in the fifty's he was normal. Every day he went to school by foot, because in the small village where he grow up, no bus were available. It's why he went to school by foot every day. Sometimes local farmers gave a ride to school to Andre and Andre's brothers and Sisters. --User:Roussimoff Boris Andre's Nephew 04H49, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well that sounds like a good source, metropolitan. I think it would be best to just say, "Andre told author W. Goldman and others that Samuel..." then both sources could be used- and readers could be explicitly aware of where the info is coming from and judge it accordingly. But as you say, the story is more toned-down and the source is reputable so I would agree with you that it is indeed 'realistic' ( though, if I <i>had</i> to bet, I would still go with it being an embellishment of the "Beckett lived in my town" story). But, either way, it is sourceable, so thanks for coming up with a definitive answer.

<p>Answer to Metropolitain90 : The small village is Molien. It's very small (about 30 personns) and the house of Samuel Beckett (corner the road Lizy sur Ourcq and La ferte sous jouarre) is between Molien and Ussy-sur Marne, about 500 inhabitants (where the school is located). I know very well this part of Seine et Marne because I used to live there..... It's very difficult to find an independant source because all my friend at Ussy- sur-Marne don't speak english... The lieu-dit where lived Samuel Beckett is call by the village "Tarzan" !!! --User:Roussimoff Boris Andre's Nephew</p>

<p>In the popular culture can someone add that he is mentioned in the Australian movie Kenny.
