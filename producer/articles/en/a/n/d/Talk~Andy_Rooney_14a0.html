<p>This line was changed. It is now "He has admitted on Larry King Live to having politically progressive views.". The line was "He has admitted on Larry King Live to having a liberal bias." I suspect someone changed it thinking it was POV. No, I saw that episode, he admitted having a liberal bias, those were almost his exact words. His 'progressive' views were already well known, he didnt have to admit anything we didnt already know. If I dont hear a counter arguement I am going to change it. <a href="../../../p/z/g/User%7EPzg_Ratzinger_30e5.html" title="User:Pzg Ratzinger">user:Pzg_Ratzinger</a></p>
<p>EDIT: Found it from CNN transcripts, added it back and sourced</p>
<p><br />
Seeing as "progressive" is a recent newspeak term I doubt that it applies to Rooney. His statement that he has a "liberal bias" is far more truthful than the whitewash of "progressive views" . And have to see the guy? He is about as open to progress as Uncle Joe!</p>

<p><i>Rooney is popularly thought to be an atheist based on a series of comments he made regarding Mel Gibson's film The Passion of the Christ. In public comments, he has described himself as an agnostic. He has admitted on Larry King Live to having a liberal bias.</i></p>
<p>If he said that he was agnostic then I'm guessing he's agnostic. The atheist bit is unneccesary and probably used by someone who doesn't understand the differences in agnosticism/atheism. -<a href="../../../k/u/g/User%7EKugamazog_6dff.html" title="User:Kugamazog">User:Kugamazog</a></p>
<p>Rooney has also said that he's an atheist.

<p>I believe we should add a segmenet on here concerning a very short interview he had with Ali G (Sacha Baron Cohen) in which he made rather silly comments, including trying to correct Cohen's use of the word "racialist," even when Cohen already commented on the differences between American and British English. --70.186.192.13 01:39, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree!<br /></p>
<p>One note on the differences between American and British English. In American English, "the media has" is correct. "the media have" can also be used, but is rarer.</p>
<dl>
<dd>No it's not. "Media" is plural.</dd>
</dl>
<p>-</p>
<p>I dont understand why this line is included in the trivia section&#160;; <i>In anger, Rooney also claimed that the press could never print election results before the election took place.</i> He isnt claiming anything, he is stating an obvious, logical fact. Unless I am missing the joke (?) I think that line should be removed from the section, as it doesn't make sense.<br />
Perhaps note also in the trivia section that Andy Rooney is the first person to pull Ali up on his terrible grammar, as all of Ali's previous interviewees over a 5 year+ period have just smiled and accepted Ali's mangled English.. As I think this illustrates nicely Andy's professional, investigative and 'I-dont-buy-any-BS' attitude. But also, I think, it should be noted that he does offer to loan Ali G a book on the English language, as this shows that he wasn't just being a prick (for lack of a more encyclopedic appropriate descriptor) in his criticism of Ali's syntax. And lastly, Andy Rooney's page here at wikipedia deserves to be larger than it is.. as he is a deeply respected journalist with a career spanning six decades and has done a large amount of good in his life fighting corruption and evil. <a href="../../../d/i/r/User%7EDirk_Diggler_Jnr_2171.html" title="User:Dirk Diggler Jnr">Dirk Diggler Jnr</a> 01:59, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I couldn't disagree more. He was being a prick when correcting his english since ebonics is considered by at the very least to be a dialect of american english by the african american communities that rooney revealed at best to have complete contempt for and at worst to be completely ignorant of. [User:A Hung[ydefined]]</p>
<p>The trivia section, to me, doesn't seem like it holds an awful lot of trivia.--DarthKobold 04:53, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This section seems quite slanted.</p>
<p>"It has been said that Rooney's appearance on the show is perhaps the best example of this." It has been said? It has been said by whom? This is an old Fox News trick, stating opinions while attributing them to people who only supposedly exist.</p>
<p>How do we know Ali G was making a "thinly-veiled reference to the 1948 US presidential election"? He first talks about a plane crash. Then he mentions putting out the election results "a few days early." The 1948 election featured a paper jumping the gun and putting out election results one day early. I see no reason to assume this is in reference to the 1948 election, and find it much more likely that this example was chosen because this interview aired during an election year, just a few months before the election, if there is in fact any particular reason this example was chosen at all.</p>
<p>Rooney does not "imply" that the word "racialist" does not exist. Rooney said "it's 'racist' not 'racialist.'" Though racialist is a real word, the context in which Ali G used it was not correct. From the very page on <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racialism.html" title="Racialism">racialism</a> which is linked: "While the term racism often refers to individual attitudes and institutional discrimination, racialism usually implies the existence of a social or political movement that promotes a theory of racism." There is nothing in what Rooney said to imply that he's promoting a social or political movement; Rooney's "rudeness" being connected to Ali G claiming to be black would, in fact, be racism, not racialism.</p>
<p>The thing about the "acceptability of ebonics" also doesn't make sense. How is it "accepted," and what reason is there to assume Andy Rooney accepts it? The article on <a href="../../../e/b/o/Ebonics.html" title="Ebonics">ebonics</a> says it's an American dialect; the Ali G character is from England. -- DondleAtkinson 12:57, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I again deleted the statement about Ali G. in the trivia section. It may be funny to watch, but it is not really that important. All that was posted in relation to this Ali G. bit (the 1948 election, the word racialist, ebonics) was just to justify that this silly interview should be mentioned here.</p>

<p>I would like to see some better citations before working the following incident into the biography, but I think it bears mentioning if both sides can be found and cited. Below is copied from a 'this day in history' thingy used in lots of places:</p>

<p>Feb 8 1990</p>
<p>After "60 Minutes" commentator Andy Rooney expresses his view that "blacks have watered down genes because the less intelligent ones are the ones that have the most children", he is suspended for a month by CBS. Rooney claims the remarks are fabricated.</p>
