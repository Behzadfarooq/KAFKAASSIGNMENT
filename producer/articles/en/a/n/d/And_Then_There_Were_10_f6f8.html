<p>Near Saturn, two alien ships are battling each other: one a small blue-ish ship, the other a much larger red-ish ship. The two trade blasts with neither giving any ground, despite the apparent mismatch in class. On the larger ship, the various robots at the consoles report the damage being caused by the other ship. Their commader, <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_10.html#Vilgax" title="Ben 10">Vilgax</a>, orders them to disable the vessel so they can retrieve the <a href="../../../o/m/n/Omnitrix.html" title="Omnitrix">Omnitrix</a>. Believing himself to be undefeatable, he wonders who could possibly stop him.</p>
<p>At school, Ben is let out for summer vacation. His grandfather, <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_10.html#Max_Tennyson" title="Ben 10">Max</a>, arrives in his RV so they can go on their summer trip. Ben is excited about the trip, but his mood changes when he finds his cousin <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_10.html#Gwendolyn_.22Gwen.22_Tennyson" title="Ben 10">Gwen</a> in the trailer. Max explains that Gwen will be joining them on the trip. She's no more pleased about going than Ben is about her being there, having already planned out her entire summer in advance only to have Max convince her mother to send her on the camping trip. The two pout and Max comments that it's going to be a long vacation.</p>
<p>At the campsite, Max has made a rather strange dinner of still-living marinated meal-worms. Ben asks for real food, but Max insists that the trip will be an adventure for their taste buds. Once he leaves, Ben and Gwen go over the food they brought with them, which consists of some candy, chips, and health food, hoping to stretch it out for three months.</p>
<p>Back in space, the two ships are still battling, having nearly reached Earth by this point. Vilgax's ship finally disables the engines of the smaller ship. Vilgax orders his officers to prepare a boarding party to retrieve the Omnitrix. Cornered, the alien ships charge a dome on the top of their ship. It then fires a powerful laser blast at Vilgax's ship, destroying it's bridge. In retaliation, Vilgax's ship charges a similar beam, located at the bow of the ship, and returns fire, reducing most of the smaller ship to wreckage. Only its bridge remains. Now completely defenseless, the ship launches an escape pod and sends it to Earth. As it enters the atmosphere, it breaks apart and releases a smaller sphere for the remainder of the descent.</p>
<p>At the campsite, Ben eventually gets tired of trading barbs with Gwen and takes a walk in the woods. He stops when he sees what seems to be a shooting star. As he stares, it turns at a ninety-degree angle and heads straight for him, but he manages to get out of the way before being crushed. Recovering from the near hit, Ben walks over to the crater where the object crashed. It's the sphere the smaller ship had launched earlier, but Ben is under the impression that it's a satellite. As he approaches it, it cools itself off and opens up, revealing a strange looking watch. When Ben tries to get a better look, the watch opens itself as if it were alive and attaches to Ben's wrist. Despite his best efforts, Ben can't remove it.</p>
<p>Heading back to the campsite, Ben fiddles with the device, still attempting to remove it. He ends up inadvertently activating the Omnitrix and transforming himself into <a href="../../../o/m/n/Omnitrix.html#Heatblast" title="Omnitrix">Heatblast</a>, an alien capable of creating fire at will. Heatblast is understandbly surprised, believing himself to be on fire (which he is) and running back and forth appropriately. He soon realizes that the fire isn't hurting, and decides to test his new form on the surrounding forest by throwing fireballs at the trees. Inevitably, the trees catch fire and the fire spreads, much to Ben's dismay. Heatblast tries to stomp out the fire, but his current form only causes him to spread it further.</p>
<p>Noticing the fire Heatblast caused, though not aware that he is responsible, Gwen and Max head to the forest with fire extinguishers. Gwen eventually runs into Heatblast, and isn't willing to talk at first. After he convinces her that he's really Ben (by calling Gwen a freak), she asks him about his appearance, and Heatblast goes into a drawn-out explanation of his situation, recapping the entire incident in under a minute. When Max shows up, and Gwen implies that Heatblast is Ben, leading Max to ask the same question that Gwen did earlier, Heatblast almost goes into his explanation again, but Gwen stops him, pointing out the rapidly-spreading fire. Since it has gone far beyond their ability to handle, Max has Ben start a back-draft to snuff the fire out. Later on, a ranger arrives, clearly confused by the fire that seems to have put itself out.</p>
<p>On Vilgax's ship, Vilgax is shown to have survived the destruction of the bridge, albeit barely. His limbs are almost completely gone, with only a small portion of his right arm intact. His subordinates have placed him inside a regeneration tank, complete with tiny robots, to heal him. A subordinate officer informs him that the Omnitrix was sent to Earth before they could board the transport, revealing Ben's watch to be the Omnitrix. Turning to another robot, Vilgax orders it to retrieve the Omnitrix.</p>
<p>At the campsite, Heatblast, Gwen, and Max are discussing Heatblast's situation. Max seems to recognize him as an alien, almost too immediately, but says that it's obvious, since Ben couldn't possibly be anything else. Heatblast then expresses concern over being an alien forever, at which Omnitrix begins glowing red and beeping at an increasing rate. Once it hits a solid tone, Heatblast reverts back into human form. Ben attempts to remove the Omnitrix again after transforming back, having no more luck this time, either. Max warns him not to mess with it until they get a better idea of what it is, then heads for the site where it crashed to investigate. Meanwhile, Vilgax's robot arrives on Earth. It lands near the crash site and finds the pod that held the Omnitrix. Since the Omnitrix is no longer there, it vaporizes the pod and sends two drones to find it.</p>
<p>Ben eventually figures out how the Omnitrix works and uses it to transforms into <a href="../../../o/m/n/Omnitrix.html#Wildmutt" title="Omnitrix">Wildmutt</a>, a canine-like alien with enhanced senses but no eyes. He hops around the forest to test its abilities, drawing the attention of one of the drones. Wildmutt defeats the drone, but reverts back to human form just as the second drone arrives. Luckily, Gwen arrives to beat Ben's would-be attacker into wreckage with a shovel.</p>
<p>After Max has a talk with Ben about his "joyride" with the Omnitrix, they learn that the larger robot is attacking the campground. They head to the site of the attack and Ben transforms himself into <a href="../../../o/m/n/Omnitrix.html#Diamondhead" title="Omnitrix">Diamondhead</a>, a crystalline alien. Gwen asks what it does, to which Ben's reply is, "I dunno, but I bet it's gonna be cool." They then move on to find the robot blasting vehicles left and right in an attempt to find the Omnitrix. After a short battle, Diamondhead gains the upper-hand and defeats the robot. Vilgax is quite annoyed upon hearing about the defeat of his robot.</p>
<p>Later on, Ben tests another of the Omnitrix's aliens; <a href="../../../o/m/n/Omnitrix.html#XLR8" title="Omnitrix">XLR8</a> (a pun on "accelerate"), which is a super-fast, lizard-like alien. He uses this alien to pack up all their equipment and get revenge on some bullies that appeared earlier in the episode. All three believe that they're going to have an interesting summer.</p>
