<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_Sathya_Sai_Baba_movement_125a.html" title="Edit section: Important teachings">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Important teachings</span></h2>
<p>Sathya Sai Baba (SSB) preaches love and the unity of all religions. He says that all religions lead to <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> and that followers should continue to follow their original <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">religions</a>. He says that those who follow his teachings will find themselves exampling their own original faith more fully, i.e. that will make <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christians</a> become better Christians and Hindus better Hindus, et cetera.</p>
<p>He preaches a foundation of five basic human values: Truth (<a href="../../../s/a/t/Sathya.html" title="Sathya">Sathya</a>), Right Conduct (<a href="../../../d/h/a/Dharma.html" title="Dharma">Dharma</a>), Peace (<a href="../../../s/h/a/Shantih.html" title="Shantih">Shantih</a>), Love for God and all creatures (<a href="../../../p/r/e/Prema.html" title="Prema">Prema</a>), and Non-violence (<a href="../../../a/h/i/Ahimsa.html" title="Ahimsa">Ahimsa</a>).</p>
<p>Other important teaching are</p>
<ul>
<li>Service and charity (<a href="../../../s/e/v/Seva.html" title="Seva">seva</a>) to others.</li>
<li>Love for all creatures and objects</li>
<li>Put a ceiling (limit) on one's desires.</li>
<li>Everything that has been created is <a href="../../../m/a/y/Maya_%28Hinduism%29_9d76.html" title="Maya (Hinduism)">maya</a> (illusion), only God is real.</li>
<li>Every creature and object is God in form, though most do not experience this as their reality.</li>
<li><a href="../../../v/e/g/Vegetarianism.html" title="Vegetarianism">Vegetarianism</a></li>
<li>Detachement from the material world</li>
<li><a href="../../../m/e/d/Meditation.html" title="Meditation">Meditation</a> - Baba teaches four techniques, repetition of the name of God, visualising the form of God, sitting in silence and <i>jyoti</i> (Light meditation).</li>
<li>Inclusive acceptance of all religions as paths to realizing the One (God).</li>
<li>Importance of <a href="../../../b/h/a/Bhakti.html" title="Bhakti">bhakti</a> (devotion) to God</li>
<li>Developing virtues and eschewing vices of character</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/a/p/Japa.html" title="Japa">japa</a> and other <a href="../../../s/a/d/Sadhana.html" title="Sadhana">sadhana</a> (spiritual exercise) to foster devotion.</li>
<li>Reverence for parents, teachers and elders</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of his followers consider his many teachings as a divine <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revelation.html" title="Revelation">revelation</a> containing good advice for daily life and <i><a href="../../../s/a/d/Sadhana.html" title="Sadhana">sadhana</a></i> (spiritual exercises). However, his followers are generally aware that they cannot put into practice all of his teachings at the same time, so many just choose which they think is most important for them or what takes the least effort.</p>
<p>He preaches a strict morality with regards to sensual desires (including food, sex, alcohol). Some of his exhortations are to put a ceiling on desires. By this, he seems to mean that followers should not waste time and money. He teaches that the world is just <i><a href="../../../m/a/y/Maya_%28illusion%29.html" title="Maya (illusion)">maya</a></i> , that only God is real and that the seeming diversity of all life is another illusion. All life is one, he says. The meaning of life is to experience this oneness with God and other living beings. He advocates <a href="../../../v/e/g/Vegetarianism.html" title="Vegetarianism">vegetarianism</a> and total abstinence from <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcoholic_beverage.html" title="Alcoholic beverage">alcohol</a>.</p>
<p>Followers attribute many miracles to him which they witness in his presence and in their own countries, like spontaneous <a href="../../../v/i/b/Vibhuti.html" title="Vibhuti">vibhuti</a> manifestations on the pictures of the guru in their homes, and <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bilocation.html" title="Bilocation">bilocation</a>, the appearance of Sai Baba in their own presence while he is also in another place. They also report that he has materialized out-of-season fruit several times. He says he performs these miracles to attract people and then to transform them <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spirituality.html" title="Spirituality">spiritually</a>.</p>
<p>SSB said that he does not speak through other people in a discourse in 1962.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> In spite of this, the British author Lucas Ralli claimed that he received messages from SSB and wrote in his books that his claim was endorsed by SSB in an interview. His books with messages from SSB are sold by the Sathya Sai Book Center of America. <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The British newspaper <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Times_47ca.html" title="The Times">the Times</a> described Sathya Sai Baba's teachings in 2001 as "a collection of banal truisms and platitudes."<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>Followers believe that SSB was born on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_23.html" title="November 23">23 November</a> <a href="../../../1/9/2/1926.html" title="1926">1926</a>, as described in the authorized biography by Narayana Kasturi. They believe that the Indian guru <a href="../../../a/u/r/Aurobindo.html" title="Aurobindo">Aurobindo</a> was referring to him when he said that the divine had descended on earth on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_24.html" title="November 24">24 November</a> <a href="../../../1/9/2/1926.html" title="1926">1926</a>. According to them he performed many <a href="../../../m/i/r/Miracle.html" title="Miracle">miracles</a> as a boy (levitating, materializing fruit, sweets, pencils etc., clairvoyance). When he was around 14 according to N. Kasturi he announced that he was a <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reincarnation.html" title="Reincarnation">reincarnation</a> of the <a href="../../../f/a/k/Fakir.html" title="Fakir">fakir</a> <a href="../../../s/a/i/Sai_Baba_of_Shirdi_0008.html" title="Sai Baba of Shirdi">Sai Baba of Shirdi</a>. In order to prove it he dropped some jasmin flowers which arranged in the words "Sai Baba" in Telugu. Since then he was worshiped in the whole of Puttaparthi as a <a href="../../../g/u/r/Guru.html" title="Guru">guru</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/i/Deity.html" title="Deity">deity</a>. He started gaining more and more followers. According to N. Kasturi he performed spectacular miracles for them such as healings, materializations, making his face appear on the moon and proving his <a href="../../../o/m/n/Omnipresence.html" title="Omnipresence">omnipresence</a>. <a href="http://intyoga.online.fr/siddhi.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://intyoga.online.fr/siddhi.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>

<p>The popularity and the donations by followers have enabled SSB and his organizations to build an ever-increasingly big <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashram.html" title="Ashram">ashram</a> called <a href="../../../p/r/a/Prashanthi_Nilayam_e905.html" title="Prashanthi Nilayam">Prashanthi Nilayam</a> near the once poor and isolated village of <a href="../../../p/u/t/Puttaparthi.html" title="Puttaparthi">Puttaparthi</a>.</p>
<p>SSB resides much of the time in his main <i>ashram</i> Prashanthi Nilayam (abode of peace) at Puttaparthi. In the hot summer the guru leaves for his other ashram called <i>Brindavan</i> in <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitefield%2C_India_1d44.html" title="Whitefield, India">Whitefield</a> (sometimes called Kadugodi), a town on the outskirts of <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangalore.html" title="Bangalore">Bangalore</a>.</p>
<p>He is a prolific <a href="../../../o/r/a/Orator.html" title="Orator">orator</a> in his native language of <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telugu_language.html" title="Telugu language">Telugu</a><sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> , and also speaks passable <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamil_language.html" title="Tamil language">Tamil</a>. He claims to be the <i><a href="../../../k/a/l/Kali_Yuga_fc0d.html" title="Kali Yuga">Kali Yuga</a></i> <i>purna <a href="../../../a/v/a/Avatar.html" title="Avatar">avatar</a></i> (full divine incarnation of this era) of Lord <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiva.html" title="Shiva">Shiva</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakti.html" title="Shakti">Shakti</a>. He says that he is <a href="../../../o/m/n/Omniscience.html" title="Omniscience">omniscient</a>, <a href="../../../o/m/n/Omnipotence.html" title="Omnipotence">omnipotent</a> and <a href="../../../o/m/n/Omnipresence.html" title="Omnipresence">omnipresent</a> and can create matter from mere thought. He also stresses he is free from desires. He plays down his claims about being an incarnation of God by saying that everybody is God but that only he realizes and experiences this fully. In correspondence with his perceived divinity, followers often capitalize references to him in their writings ("He", "Him" etcetera).</p>
<p>He says that he will <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reincarnation.html" title="Reincarnation">reincarnate</a> again in this century as <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prema_Sai_Baba_ab9f.html" title="Prema Sai Baba">Prema Sai Baba</a> to finish the spiritual transformation of the world, starting with India, where his previous and current incarnations have begun. He has said that he will die after he has become 93 years old but there is no official statement for the popular belief among followers that he will die when he is 95 years old (96 according to Indian counting). Sathya Sai Baba stated that his three incarnation will help to usher in the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Age_6ed8.html" title="Golden Age">Golden Age</a> of mankind that will come soon. <sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>He has left India only once for a visit to <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Africa_695f.html" title="Eastern Africa">Eastern Africa</a> in 1968. Followers report that he warned the Indian community in <a href="../../../u/g/a/Uganda.html" title="Uganda">Uganda</a> shortly before <a href="../../../i/d/i/Idi_Amin_4bbc.html" title="Idi Amin">Idi Amin</a> came to power and launched his persecution against them.</p>
<p>SSB said that he performs miracles to attract people and then to transform them spiritually and tells his followers not to focus on his miracles. Some followers are however fascinated by his miracles.</p>
<p>He can be seen in person to perform these miracles daily in the form of <a href="../../../m/a/t/Materialization_%28parapsychology%29.html" title="Materialization (parapsychology)">materializations</a> of small objects, for example jewelry such as bracelets, rings, watches and especially <i><a href="../../../v/i/b/Vibhuti.html" title="Vibhuti">vibhuti</a></i> (holy ash) and kum kum. He says that these trinkets have symbolic value and offer the owners protection by reminding them of his protecting powers when in danger. Occasionally, usually at <a href="../../../m/a/h/Maha_Shivaratri_2f31.html" title="Maha Shivaratri">Maha Shivaratri</a>, he publicly produces <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lingam.html" title="Lingam">lingams</a> that come out of his mouth that he claims to materialize in his body.</p>
<p>Baba has said that all of his acts have meaning and significance. So many followers interpret the acts and sayings of the guru as teachings, sometimes even as personal teachings. Some followers, especially in the ashram, attribute coincidences to Baba’s will and try to find a sometimes hidden meaning in them.</p>
<p>He says that he can <a href="../../../f/a/i/Faith_healer.html" title="Faith healer">heal</a> the diseases of his devotees by either his spiritual power or by taking on the disease himself. There is <a href="../../../a/n/e/Anecdotal_evidence.html" title="Anecdotal evidence">anecdotal evidence</a> that supports this claim.</p>
<p>He says that when a person dreams about him then this is because of his will and this is a form of his communication with people. Followers report dreams with a special energy that contain messages from the guru to them. Some people became devotees after having such a dream.</p>
<p>He teaches a rather traditional but <a href="../../../s/y/n/Syncretism.html" title="Syncretism">syncretistic</a> form of <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism.html" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> that come from many <a href="../../../s/e/c/Sect.html" title="Sect">sects</a> and movements including <i><a href="../../../a/d/v/Advaita.html" title="Advaita">advaita</a></i>, occasionally drawing from other religions like <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, Sikhism, and Christianity. He says that he has come to restore <a href="../../../f/a/i/Faith.html" title="Faith">faith</a> in, and the practice of, the <a href="../../../v/e/d/Vedas.html" title="Vedas">Vedas</a>. As a result his teachings stress few changes in traditional Hindu thought or <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">philosophies</a>. He says that a very important way a person can emancipate oneself is through self-less service to ones fellow man (seva). He also encurages devotees to keep practicing (or return to the practice of) their own religion; for example Western devotees should practice <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, and so on.</p>
<p>He stresses the importance of <i><a href="../../../s/a/d/Sadhana.html" title="Sadhana">sadhana</a></i> (Hindu spiritual exercises) and says that there are three forms of meditation that are safe and lead quickly to <i><a href="../../../m/o/k/Moksha.html" title="Moksha">moksha</a></i> (liberation from ignorance and from the endless re-births due to <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karma.html" title="Karma">karmic</a> consequences). The forms are <i>namasmarana</i> ('remembrance of the name' [of God], usually through repetition), <i>light-<a href="../../../m/e/d/Meditation.html" title="Meditation">meditation</a></i> (mental concentration on a steady light) and the <i>so ham-meditation</i> (repeating the <i><a href="../../../m/a/n/Mantra.html" title="Mantra">mantra</a></i> "so ham" silently-- so means He and ham means I, namely that The Lord and I are one. Baba says that other forms of meditation are a waste of time and can even be dangerous.</p>
<p>Sathya Sai Baba teaches the importance of <i><a href="../../../b/h/a/Bhakti_yoga.html" title="Bhakti yoga">Bhakti yoga</a></i> (Hindu devotion through selfless service) and that it grows more easily if one has an <i><a href="../../../i/s/h/Ishta-Deva_ea71.html" title="Ishta-Deva">Ishta-Deva</a></i> (chosen personal form of the divine). For many devotees the <i>Ishta-Deva</i> is Sathya Sai Baba himself. He teaches a strict morality and the importance of renouncing worldly desires so as to free the intellect of distraction while attuning the conscience to a deeper more personal involvement with the divine nature.</p>
<p>One important practice in his ashrams is <i><a href="../../../d/a/r/Darshan.html" title="Darshan">darshan</a></i> (spiritual sight). During <i>darshan</i> Sathya Sai Baba walks among his followers. He may listen to a few chosen persons, accept letters, or materialize and distribute <i>vibhuti</i> (sacred ash of Lord <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiva.html" title="Shiva">Shiva</a>). He says that his <i>darshan</i> has spiritual benefits for those who attend it. Usually people wait hours to get a good place for <i>darshan</i>. Sathya Sai Baba sometimes invites people for a group interview with him in a room in the <i><a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashram.html" title="Ashram">ashram</a></i> 's <i><a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandir.html" title="Mandir">mandir</a></i> (Hindu temple). Followers consider it a great privilege to get such an interview. Sometimes a person from this group is invited for a private interview.</p>
<p>Baba has discouraged publicity and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proselytism.html" title="Proselytism">proselytism</a> for him in a public discourse. (23 Nov. 1968)</p>
<p>The anthropologist Lawrence Babb wrote in a 1983 article that "the miraculous are absolutely central to this religious movement" and that the plausibility of these miracles "seems to pull people into convictions ostensibly at odds with what their own subculture deems to be common sense and considered judgment." He wrote in that article that his observations are based on his contact with the local following of Sathya Sai Baba in Delhi that according to Babb included a sophisticated and cosmopolitan elite. Babb further wrote in that article that the energy of Sathya Sai Baba’s "magic" can have "life-transforming effects on devotees." <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Babb wrote in a 1986 book that followers tend attribute every event to Sathya Sai Baba's will and tend to see the world as an <i>enchanted garden.</i><sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

<p>Across the globe local Sathya Sai Baba groups assemble to sing <i><a href="../../../b/h/a/Bhajan.html" title="Bhajan">bhajans</a></i> (devotional songs). Baba says that concentration on the name of God with the help of <i>bhajans</i> will easily lead to concentration on God and to bigger devotion. <i>Bhajans</i> are sung on nearly every meeting. In those bhajans the name of traditional Hindu deities have occasionally been replaced by the names of Sathya Sai Baba. In addition they study Sathya Sai Baba's teachings and the holy books of the various world religions. More obvious to outsiders however is the fact they are often involved in community service that they call <i>seva</i>.</p>
<p>The charter of the Sai Organization says that every member should undertake sadhana (spiritual discipline) as an integral part of daily life and abide by the following nine-points code of conduct <a href="http://www.sathyasai.org/devotion/ninepoint.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sathyasai.org/devotion/ninepoint.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>:</p>

<dd>2. Devotional singing/prayer with family members once per week.</dd>
<dd>3. Participation in the educational programmes conducted by the Organization for children.</dd>
<dd>4. Attendance at least once per month at group devotional programmes conducted by the Organization.</dd>
<dd>5. Participation in community service and other programmes of the Organization.</dd>
<dd>6. Regular study of Sai literature.</dd>
<dd>7. Putting into practice the principles of “ceiling on desires”, utilising any savings thereby generated for the service of mankind.</dd>

<p>Many of his followers come from tribal superstitious groups but also include the educated middle and elite classes, among whom are some high ranking writers, educators, doctors, and politicians.</p>
<p>The existing beliefs and practices in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_religious_movement.html" title="New religious movement">new religious movement</a> are not always endorsed by the guru and his organizations. The reason for this is that the guru and his organizations are quite tolerant and take little effort to refute rumors or distortions of the guru’s teachings. Some followers do not accept all his extraordinary claims but instead prefer to see him as just a <a href="../../../w/i/s/Wise_Old_Man_f0d1.html" title="Wise Old Man">sage</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint.html" title="Saint">saint</a> who has some <i><a href="../../../s/i/d/Siddhi.html" title="Siddhi">siddhic</a></i> (<a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychic.html" title="Psychic">psychic</a>) powers.</p>

"Sathya Sai Baba is, among other things, a teacher. He is a frequent giver of discourses, now compiled in several volumes. He usually speaks in Telugu, and before a Hindi-speaking audience an interpreter is required. One of his most characteristic rhetorical devices is the ad hoc (and often false) etymology. For example, he has stated that Hindu means `one who is nonviolent' by the combination of hinsa (violence) and dur (distant)."</li>

"[..]for Sathya Sai Baba's followers everything that occurs does so by his ordainment. They speak of this constantly, even in connection with what may seem to be the most trivial events; nothing happens that he does not will....Their world is something like an enchanted garden. This is a point on which it is difficult to be ethnographically precise, but it is real enough. It emerges mainly in the tone...An informant reported an altercation with someone while staying at Baba's ashram; immediately upon leaving the room his eye lighted on a sign with some slogan about the evils of anger. Another informant reports longing for a guava, having seen a few unimpressive specimens for sale while on a motor trip. When her car halted, a man suddenly appeared by its side with two plump and juicy ones, which he sold her for eight annas. This, of course, was Baba himself. Another informant tells of how she was frightened by the dark clouds surrounding an aircraft in which she was descending for a landing at Nagpur. But then, just as the thought of Baba flashed through her mind, the plane passed through a momentary shaft of sunlight."</li>
