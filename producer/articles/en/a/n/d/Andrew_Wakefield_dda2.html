	    <p><b>Andrew Wakefield</b> (born <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a> in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>) is a <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian.html" title="Canadian">Canadian</a> trained <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surgeon.html" title="Surgeon">surgeon</a>, best known as the lead author of a controversial <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a> research study, published in the <i><a href="../../../l/a/n/Lancet.html" title="Lancet">Lancet</a></i>, which reported bowel symptoms in a selected sample of twelve children with <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autistic_spectrum.html" title="Autistic spectrum">autistic spectrum</a> disorders and other disabilities, and alleged a possible connection with <a href="../../../m/m/r/MMR_vaccine_27af.html" title="MMR vaccine">MMR vaccination</a> <a href="http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-paper.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-paper.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Citing safety concerns, in a press conference held in conjunction with the release of the report Dr. Wakefield recommended separating the components of the injections by at least a year. The recommendation, along with widespread media coverage of Wakefield's claims was responsible for a decrease in <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immunisation.html" title="Immunisation">immunisation</a> rates in the UK. <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/10/31/health/main581192.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/10/31/health/main581192.shtml" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. The section of the paper setting out its conclusions, known in the Lancet as the "interpretation" (see the text below), was subsequently retracted by ten of the paper's thirteen authors [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autistic_enterocolitis#.22Retraction_of_an_interpretation.22" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autistic_enterocolitis#.22Retraction_of_an_interpretation.22" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>]. <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn4743" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn4743" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>Following the controversy, in March 2004 the <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Medical_Council_1b88.html" title="General Medical Council">GMC</a> announced it was launching an inquiry into allegations of serious professional misconduct against Dr Wakefield and two former colleagues <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/5070670.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/5070670.stm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, Dr Peter Harvey and Professor Walker-Smith. Wakefield and Harvey do not retract the interpretation. It centred on claims that autistic children admitted to the hospital were subjected to "unnecessary and invasive", tests, and the basis for the claim of a possible link between MMR and autism. However, some of the children's parents are understood to have staunchly defended the doctors' actions, praising them as the first to take their concerns seriously. By June 2006, the <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Medical_Council_1b88.html" title="General Medical Council">GMC</a> had not yet filed charges against Wakefield, but it was expected that formal hearings in the case would begin in 2007 <a href="http://briandeer.com/mmr/st-june-2006-1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://briandeer.com/mmr/st-june-2006-1.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>.</p>
<p>Wakefield has since claimed in several journals, including the <i>Journal of Clinical Immunology</i>, to have discovered a new disease, unlike other childhood intestinal disorders. However, no other group has confirmed this claim. Since arriving in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> in the wake of the MMR controversies, over which he is accused of <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_misconduct.html" title="Scientific misconduct">scientific misconduct</a>, Wakefield has continued his research at the <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thoughtful_House_4810.html" title="Thoughtful House">Thoughtful House</a>, a centre for <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autistic.html" title="Autistic">autistic</a> children in <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a>.<a href="http://thoughtfulhouse.org/editorials.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://thoughtfulhouse.org/editorials.php" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></p>
<p>In May 2006 one of Wakefield's colleagues from Thoughtful House presented some preliminary research in Montreal, Canada, that he said supported Wakefield's findings with what was described as fresh evidence of the presence of the vaccine strain of the measles virus in the guts of autistic children <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/05/28/wmmr28.xml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/05/28/wmmr28.xml" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. Dr Stephen Walker, of the Wake Forest University School of Medicine, North Carolina, however, warned against making any such connection <a href="http://www.mmrthefacts.nhs.uk/news/newsitem.php?id=110" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mmrthefacts.nhs.uk/news/newsitem.php?id=110" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Wakefield_dda2.html" title="Edit section: Early career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early career</span></h2>
<p>Dr. Andy Wakefield, MB BS FRCS FRCPath, is an academic gastroenterologist. He graduated in Medicine from <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_College_School_of_Medicine_6d26.html" title="Imperial College School of Medicine">St. Maryâ€™s Hospital</a>, part of the University of London, in 1981, and pursued a career in gastrointestinal surgery, pursuing an interest in <a href="../../../i/n/f/Inflammatory_bowel_disease.html" title="Inflammatory bowel disease">inflammatory bowel disease</a> (such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis). He became a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1985, and in 1996 he was awarded a <a href="../../../w/e/l/Wellcome_Trust_4ffb.html" title="Wellcome Trust">Wellcome Trust</a> Traveling Fellowship to study animal small intestinal transplantation in Toronto, Canada.</p>
<p>Discoveries made during his time in Canada led him to pursue the scientific investigation of inflammatory bowel disease. In 1998, he and his colleagues at the Royal Free Hospital reported what he claimed to be a novel inflammatory bowel disease in children with developmental disorders such as autism; which he later called <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autistic_enterocolitis.html" title="Autistic enterocolitis">autistic enterocolitis</a>. He left the Royal Free School of Medicine in 2001, after refusing financial support from his employer, University College London, to verify his hypothesis in a large cohort of children. He is involved in scientific collaborations in the U.S and Europe. The main focus of Dr. Wakefieldâ€™s research is an investigation of the immunologic, metabolic, and pathologic changes occurring in inflammatory bowel diseases such as autistic enterocolitis, links between intestinal disease and neurologic injury in children, and the potential relationship of these conditions to environmental causes, such as childhood vaccines.</p>
<p>During the course of his work on childhood developmental disorders, Dr. Wakefield said he became increasingly convinced of the need for a research-oriented, integrated bio-medical and educational approach to these disorders in order to translate clinical benefits for affected children into measurable developmental progress; this is the driving aim of Thoughtful House. Dr. Wakefield has published 132 original scientific articles, book chapters and invited scientific commentaries and was awarded the Fellowship of the Royal College of Pathologists in 2001. He is medical advisor to the United Kingdom charity, Visceral, and sits on the board of the U.S. charity, Medical Interventions for Autism.</p>
<p>In 1995, while conducting research into Crohn's disease, he was approached by Rosemary Kessick, the parent of an autistic child seeking help with her son's bowel problems <a href="http://briandeer.com/wakefield/dawbarns-kessick.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://briandeer.com/wakefield/dawbarns-kessick.htm" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>. Kessick ran a group, Allergy Induced Autism <a href="http://www.autismmedical.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.autismmedical.com" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>, focused on the effects of diet of autistic children's behavior. Wakefield subsequently began the controversial <i>Lancet</i> study that ultimately included 12 children, including Kessick's son.</p>
<p>He is currently the Executive Director of Thoughtful House Center for Children (www.thoughtfulhouse.org).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Wakefield_dda2.html" title="Edit section: The MMR controversy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The MMR controversy</span></h2>
<p>In February <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a> a paper<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> written by Wakefield and 12 other doctors about 12 <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autistic_spectrum.html" title="Autistic spectrum">autistic spectrum</a> children was published in the <i>Lancet</i>. Although in the paper the authors stressed no causal connection had been proven, Wakefield called for suspension of the triple MMR vaccine at a press conference and in a video news release issued by the hospital. <a href="http://briandeer.com/wakefield/royal-video.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://briandeer.com/wakefield/royal-video.htm" rel="nofollow">[12]</a></p>
<p>He said, "If you give three viruses together, three live viruses, then you potentially increase the risk of an adverse event occurring, particularly when one of those viruses influences the immune system in the way that measles does." He suggested parents should opt for single jabs against measles, mumps and rubella, separated by gaps of one year.</p>
<p>The paper described what its authors suggested was a possible new <a href="../../../s/y/n/Syndrome.html" title="Syndrome">syndrome</a>, raising the possibility of a link between a novel form of bowel disease, autism, and the MMR vaccine. In prefacing the study's findings, the authors noted parents of eight of the twelve children reported the onset of behavioral problems within two weeks of MMR vaccination. In the published <i>Lancet</i> summary, the authors wrote, "We identified associated gastrointestinal disease and developmental regression in a group of previously normal children, which was generally associated in time with possible environmental triggers." These possible triggers were reported to be MMR in eight cases, and measles infection in one. The paper was instantly controversial, leading to widespread publicity in the UK and the convening of a special panel of the UK's <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medical_Research_Council_5809.html" title="Medical Research Council">Medical Research Council</a> the following month.<a href="http://briandeer.com/mmr/wakefield-mrc.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://briandeer.com/mmr/wakefield-mrc.htm" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></p>
<p>Publicity for Wakefield's warnings caused a drop in the number of children receiving MMR, as had been predicted in a letter to the government by Wakefield's chief at the hospital.<a href="http://briandeer.com/wakefield/roy-pounder.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://briandeer.com/wakefield/roy-pounder.htm" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> The controversy escalated as the UK government declined to introduce single-jab alternatives (which would have required licenced products to become available), based on the contention most closely associated with Dr David Salisbury, Deputy Chief Medical Officer, that the risk of prolonging the period before children were immunised against all three diseases was greater than any credible risk of harm from combining them. Single vaccines, spaced a year apart, clearly expose children to greater risk of infection, as well as additional distress and expense,and no evidence had been produced upon which to adopt such a policy.</p>
<p>In November <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a> Wakefield become a fellow of the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_College_of_Pathologists_0215.html" title="Royal College of Pathologists">Royal College of Pathologists</a> in recognition of his research publications.</p>
<p>In December <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, Wakefield resigned from the Royal Free Hospital, saying, "I have been asked to go because my research results are unpopular." The medical school said that he had left "by mutual agreement." In February, 2002, Wakefield stated, "What precipitated this crisis was the removal of the single vaccine, the removal of choice, and that is what has caused the furor - because the doctors, the gurus, are treating the public as though they are some kind of moronic mass who cannot make an informed decision for themselves."<a href="http://www.sundayherald.com/22194" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sundayherald.com/22194" rel="nofollow">[15]</a></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Wakefield_dda2.html" title="Edit section: Aftermath of initial controversy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Aftermath of initial controversy</span></h3>
<p>Wakefield has continued conducting clinical research in the US, joining American researcher Dr. <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Bradstreet_21fe.html" title="Jeff Bradstreet">Jeff Bradstreet</a> to conduct further studies on the possible relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, many parents with autistic children have come forward to tell of children who appeared to be developing normally, until shortly after administration of MMR but whose children's development regressed, with many reported to also have digestive problems and food intolerances. Some parents have criticized Wakefield's warnings about the potential adverse effects of the MMR, contending they were made to feel guilty for having had their child vaccinated. Wakefield's medical critics say the temporal association between vaccination and the appearance of developmental disorders is inevitable, rather than demonstrating causation, since autism is commonly first revealed early in the second year of life, when MMR vaccination is routine.</p>
<p>The "novel bowel syndrome" claimed by Wakefield has also been criticised, since the key symptom had been recognised for many years as a common finding in children without developmental disorders <a href="http://briandeer.com/wakefield/ileal-hyperplasia.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://briandeer.com/wakefield/ileal-hyperplasia.htm" rel="nofollow">[16]</a></p>

<p>In February of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, controversy resurfaced when Wakefield was accused of a conflict of interest. The London <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sunday_Times_%28UK%29_b3d9.html" title="The Sunday Times (UK)">Sunday Times</a></i> reported that some of the parents of the 12 children in the <i>Lancet</i> study were recruited via a UK attorney preparing a lawsuit against MMR manufacturers, and that the Royal Free Hospital had received Â£55,000 from the UK's Legal Aid Board (now the Legal Services Commission) to pay for the research. <a href="http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-deer-1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-deer-1.htm" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> Previously, in October <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, the board had cut off public funding for the litigation against MMR manufacturers<a href="http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-lsc.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-lsc.htm" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>. Following an investigation of The Sunday Times allegations by the UK General Medical Council, Wakefield was charged with serious professional misconduct, including dishonesty, due to be heard by a disciplinary board in 2007 <a href="http://briandeer.com/wakefield/gmc-alleges.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://briandeer.com/wakefield/gmc-alleges.htm" rel="nofollow">[19]</a></p>
<p>In December of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, the <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sunday_Times_%28UK%29_b3d9.html" title="The Sunday Times (UK)">Sunday Times</a></i> further reported that in addition to the money given to the Royal Free Hospital, Wakefield had also been personally paid Â£400,000 which had not been previously disclosed by the attorneys responsible for the MMR lawsuit. <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-2524335,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-2524335,00.html" rel="nofollow">[20]</a></p>

<p>Twenty-four hours before the <i>Sunday Times</i> report, the <i>Lancet</i> responded to the investigation in a public statement, describing Wakefield's research as "fatally flawed," an allegation he has denied.<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3510721.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3510721.stm" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> The <i>Lancet's</i> editor said he would not have published the study if he had known of the legal involvement in the research.</p>
<p>Ten of Wakefield's 12 co-authors of the <i>Lancet</i> paper later published a "retraction of an interpretation."<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=15016483" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=15016483" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> The section of the paper retracted read as follows:</p>

</dl>
<p>The retraction stated:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>We wish to make it clear that in this paper no causal link was established between (the) vaccine and autism, as the data were insufficient. However the possibility of such a link was raised, and consequent events have had major implications for public health.

<p>In November 2004, the UK's Channel 4 Television broadcast a one-hour investigation by reporter <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Deer_9182.html" title="Brian Deer">Brian Deer</a>, which alleged that before the <i>Lancet</i> paper was published, Wakefield had filed a patent application <a href="http://briandeer.com/wakefield/vaccine-patent.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://briandeer.com/wakefield/vaccine-patent.htm" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> for a single measles vaccine, and that his laboratory had failed to find measles virus in the children.<a href="http://briandeer.com/wakefield/nick-chadwick.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://briandeer.com/wakefield/nick-chadwick.htm" rel="nofollow">[25]</a> In November 2005, the scope of the allegations facing Wakefield, which he denies, were set out in a High Court judgment <a href="http://briandeer.com/wakefield/eady-judgment.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://briandeer.com/wakefield/eady-judgment.htm" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>.

They report finding 99% of the samples contained no trace of the measles virus, and the samples that did contain the virus were just as likely to be from non-autistic children.
