<p>Lookwell? Andy Richter Controls? I realize that the former is a Conan-based venture (about a crime-solver), and the latter a Richter-based venture, but otherwise, the two topics seem to have no connection to this show. I believe the See-also box is purposed for things like episode guides, and lists related to the show itself, rather than tenuous connections that could be found by looking up the star's other work. I'd suggest that the section is not needed right now. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheHYPO_6e9a.html" title="User:TheHYPO">TheHYPO</a> 15:07, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Does anyone know if this will be a live-action program or if it will be a single-camera style? I believe this would be worth mentioning in the article.Manofthespoon 00:32, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't understand the question... live-action is typically the opposite of animation. Are you referring to multi-camera vs. single-camera? The show (as seen in an NBC promo video) appears to be single-camera. It's not a studio-audience show. I don't know if this bears mentioning in the article. I've never seen a show article mention this. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheHYPO_6e9a.html" title="User:TheHYPO">TheHYPO</a> 03:16, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I apologize, multi-camera is what I meant. However, I do believe that this would be valid info due to the recent trend in single-camera use. Also, this says a lot for the show in terms of pacing, style, and even scoring. Manofthespoon 22:23, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The wiki formatting for the screenshot for the 1st (and 2nd, but it was just a copy of the first) was improperly done, so I fixed it.</p>
<p>However, the image used is something like 80x45 pixels, a horrible resolution. And now that it's properly aligned, it looks bad. Not to mention that the image needs tagged for fair use.</p>

<dd>"Despite being prominently featured in advertising for the show's first season as “Andy’s stone-cold assistant”, she only actually appeared in two episodes of the first season (and only as Andy’s assistant in one of them), also she is not included as a featured character in the opening titles of the show."</dd>
</dl>
<p>I have no problem with the facts of this statement. However, because Nicole appears in only two episodes, I don't think she rates this level of detail. So, does she rate a listing in Cast at all? --<a href="../../../l/e/x/User%7ELexein_4b6d.html" title="User:Lexein">Lexein</a> 01:51, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We're not talking about adding in extensive spurious information here. We're talking about adding in fully relevant information which cannot be said in two words. Besides, her prominent role in the show's advertising makes her somewhat notable. 67.171.163.212 02:11, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>1. None of the advertising I've seen on NBC.com shows Nicole, and I haven't seen seen her in ads on NBC. 2. She is, at best, a guest star. Compromise: "Featured in show promotions, Nicole appears in only episodes 1 and 2." We cannot imply (with "the show's first season") any 2nd season. --<a href="../../../l/e/x/User%7ELexein_4b6d.html" title="User:Lexein">Lexein</a> 02:31, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, just about every TV ad for the show I've seen flashes "NICOLE" on the screen, along with the names of the lead characters, calling her the "stone-cold assistant." I couldn't find any of those ads (or references to them) on the Internet, but I did find a trailer for the show on <a href="../../../y/o/u/YouTube_8dd1.html" title="YouTube">YouTube</a> as well as two reviews that treat her as a major character. <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=Ag34iS47d-o" class="external autonumber" title="http://youtube.com/watch?v=Ag34iS47d-o" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><a href="http://www.denverpost.com/entertainment/ci_5419117" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.denverpost.com/entertainment/ci_5419117" rel="nofollow">[2]</a><a href="http://www.medialifemagazine.com/artman/publish/article_10787.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.medialifemagazine.com/artman/publish/article_10787.asp" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> 67.171.163.212 02:53, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Besides, we can't say "episode 2" because the show has <i>two</i> "episode 2" since the episodes are aired out of order. Furthermore, Nicole will probably be made into a major character later on, so all this will become moot anyway (unless, of course, the show gets canceled.) 67.171.163.212 03:01, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Found a few more reviews that treat Nicole as a major character. <a href="http://buzzsugar.com/172805" class="external autonumber" title="http://buzzsugar.com/172805" rel="nofollow">[4]</a><a href="http://www.calendarlive.com/tv/reviews/cl-et-barker14mar14,0,5461346.story?coll=cl-home-more-channels" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.calendarlive.com/tv/reviews/cl-et-barker14mar14,0,5461346.story?coll=cl-home-more-channels" rel="nofollow">[5]</a><a href="http://www.ugo.com/ugo/html/article/?id=16943&amp;sectionId=25" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ugo.com/ugo/html/article/?id=16943&amp;sectionId=25" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> Before you ask what this proves, I think it's fairly compelling circumstantial evidence that reviewers somehow got the idea that she's supposed to be important. And, considering the actual size of her role, where else would they get that idea except from the show's ads? 67.171.163.212 03:15, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>All the ads I see, played at nauseam on NBC, run off the list of characters - Andy, Simon, Lew, Wally and Nicole along with their "role" (Nicole is "the stone-cold assistant"). There is also a longer online ad (I think NBC's YouTube page has it) that cites her as something like "the inside informant" (and shows a clip from the pilot where Andy asks her for the tax return file). Oddly Jenny, who is in the opening sequence as a main character and appears in several episodes, is not listed in any of these ads as a key player (but Nicole is). Season one is done, in the bag, 6-episodes, period; and Nicole appears in only 2 episodes (and one, the pilot, she's not Andy's assistant). Her role is very minor in both episodes she's in. Now if a second season is produced maybe she'll show up and get a bigger part and be a regular main character. But as it is as of season one, she's just a minor a twice recurring character (regardless of the ad campaign focusing on her). So the question is should we list her on this page? <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWaldoWatcher_4bd9.html" title="User:WaldoWatcher">WaldoWatcher</a> 03:30, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>I think Nicole is notable enough to warrant a mention and that WaldoWatcher's version of the "Nicole" section sufficiently covers everything worthy of note. Maybe, for now at least, we should focus more adding stuff instead of erasing stuff. 67.171.163.212 03:43, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thanks for the discussion, and references. She's certainly heavily promoted in ads for her credited guest-starring episodes. NBC has sent mixed signals about her prominence in the series,. It's bad to insert a <i>secretarial</i> character into the protagonist's <i>office</i> then not resolve her as this episode order does: <i>Pilot</i>, <i>Fairway</i>, <i>rest-of-series</i>. I think she rates listing, in an encyclopedic NPOV way (without "despite" or "actually"), so I've put it in. Thanks again. --<a href="../../../l/e/x/User%7ELexein_4b6d.html" title="User:Lexein">Lexein</a> 12:04, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>does this mean it's only intended to run one season, as in a miniseries? 67.172.61.222 02:02, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
