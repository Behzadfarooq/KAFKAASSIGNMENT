<p>Andy Gray started selling second hand jukebox 45s and old 78 records on Felixstowe pier in 1969 and within 5 years had acquired a stall on Cambridge market. The market stall was incredibly successful and in 1976 Gray opened his first retail shop in Mill Road, Cambridge.</p>
<p>Initially, Andys was well known for undercutting competitors. This was accomplished by importing records from Europe at a bargain price and then passing the savings onto customers. The chain's expansion was slow and steady and by the early 1980s, the company had 12 stores across the East Anglia region (Cambridge (2), Bury St. Edmunds, <a href="../../../k/i/n/King%27s_Lynn_cb86.html" title="King's Lynn">King's Lynn</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peterborough.html" title="Peterborough">Peterborough</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/v/Haverhill%2C_Suffolk_f775.html" title="Haverhill, Suffolk">Haverhill</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colchester.html" title="Colchester">Colchester</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/d/Bedford.html" title="Bedford">Bedford</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/w/Lowestoft.html" title="Lowestoft">Lowestoft</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colchester.html" title="Colchester">Colchester</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norwich.html" title="Norwich">Norwich</a> and <a href="../../../i/p/s/Ipswich.html" title="Ipswich">Ipswich</a>).</p>
<p><a name="Expansion_and_Advertising" id="Expansion_and_Advertising"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andys_Records_17b3.html" title="Edit section: Expansion and Advertising">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Expansion and Advertising</span></h2>
<p>In 1983 and trading as Andys Records &amp; Video (capitalising on the success of the VHS &amp; Betamax war), Gray listed the chain as a limited company - AHG Records. By this time, Gray's brother William nee Billy had become marketing director. Early advertising was often humorous and sometimes self-deprecating as shown by this 1987 TV advert <a href="http://www.tv-ark.org.uk/" class="external text" title="http://www.tv-ark.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">commercials/regional.html</a>. Their slogan around this time was "Possibly the greatest music stores in the world". This was replaced in the early 90's by "Where music matters" and again later on by "Where music REALLY matters".</p>
<p>The company, buoyed by the relatively new formats of VHS and CD started to aggressively expand out of the Anglia region. Deciding that South England was too expensive, the Gray brothers concentrated on opening stores in the Midlands and North England. By the late 80's/early 90's Andys Records was fast becoming a well known name on the UK high street and became the UK's largest independent music retailer in 1992, a title it retained for 10 years.</p>
<p><a name="Awards" id="Awards"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andys_Records_17b3.html" title="Edit section: Awards">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><b>Awards</b></span></h2>
<p>In 1993, it won the highly prestigious Music Week Independent Retailer Award, it continued to win this award each year until 1999. The chain also came 3rd in 2002 as National Music Retailer.</p>
<p>By the mid-1990s, the company had climbed into the Top 500 of UK companies and boasted an impressive 30+ store portfolio. By this time, Andys had stopped selling cheap imports and started to (in hindsight, wrongly) compete with <a href="../../../h/m/v/HMV_faa8.html" title="HMV">HMV</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgin_Megastores_7ed7.html" title="Virgin Megastores">Virgin Megastores</a> as a premium music retailer. The chain was too small to compete with these two, but too large to undercut competitors.</p>
<p>New stores started to be opened as Andys, dropping the Records tag as it was considered too old-fashioned. In November 1999, Andys opened its 40th store in <a href="../../../l/e/a/Leamington_Spa_8d1c.html" title="Leamington Spa">Leamington Spa</a>.</p>
<p><a name="The_Downfall" id="The_Downfall"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andys_Records_17b3.html" title="Edit section: The Downfall">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Downfall</span></h2>
<p>In August 2000 it was announced that <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warrington.html" title="Warrington">Warrington</a> and <a href="../../../d/o/n/Doncaster.html" title="Doncaster">Doncaster</a> stores were to close. Battered by illegal file sharing, supermarket pricing and even cheaper online stores, the chain started to flounder. A criticism levelled at Andys was its high pricing: this was often unfair. A comprehensive price check proved that Andys was no more expensive than HMV or Virgin and in some cases, was cheaper. Andys stores were mostly situated where there were no HMV's or Virgins and therefore there was no available comparison. When there were those major competitors present, their campaign sales were better than Andys (due to their bulk buying power), and recent chart albums were available at a much lower price.</p>
<p>After more store closures in 2001 and 2002, the chain was down to a roster of just under 30 stores and lost its claim to be the largest independent chain to the up and coming Music Zone. In early 2002 Billy Gray left the company to work for rival Tower Records UK. Following a disappointing 2002 Christmas, Gray decided to go back to his roots and started to sell imports at cut-throat prices. Thousands of titles were slashed in price in January 2003, many normally retailing at £10.99 were reduced to £6.99 and £15.99/£16.99 became £10.99/£12.99. Around this time, the chain had a minor facelift with new styling and decor in most stores + new uniforms for staff.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andys_Records_17b3.html" title="Edit section: Administration">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Administration</span></h2>
<p>It was too little, too late and the company fell into administration on 28th May 2003 with just 23 stores still trading - <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/suffolk/2951538.stm" class="external free" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/suffolk/2951538.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/suffolk/2951538.stm</a></p>
<p>Debts owing were £1.5 million to suppliers and £1.5 million to <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barclays_Bank_8776.html" title="Barclays Bank">Barclays Bank</a>. It was the bank that exercised the legal right to call in the administrators after they lost faith that the company could pay back the loan that was taken out in 1992 to expand the company. Gray, now a multi-millionaire (he came 94th in the Sunday Times rich list during the mid-90's) was unwilling to continually underwrite the company after 3 years of losses.</p>
<p><a href="../../../r/s/m/RSM_Robson_Rhodes_fd43.html" title="RSM Robson Rhodes">RSM Robson Rhodes</a> were the administrators appointed by Barclay's to run the company during the administration period. All 23 stores were put up for sale as a going concern. Both HMV and Virgin looked at stores but decided not to purchase. In July 2003 South England based music retailer Powerplay bought four stores (Lowestoft, Bedford, Hull and Lancaster) from the administrators. They purchased a further two (Hereford and Worcester) in September 2003. All stores have since shut their doors and Powerplay now concentrates on online sales under the name Powerplay Direct.</p>
<p>After some immediate closures due to unprofitability, the chain was whittled down to 10 and started to sell all of its stock at discounted prices. The Beverley store was eventually bought by its management team. It stayed open till late 2005.</p>
<p>All stores eventually shut on Saturday 13th September 2003.</p>
<p>Andy Gray continues to run a successful reissue record label BGO Records <a href="http://www.bgo-records.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bgo-records.com" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> from Bury St. Edmunds (actually behind the old Andys Records head office). BGO is now the fourth largest reissue label in the UK and specialises in niche genres.</p>
