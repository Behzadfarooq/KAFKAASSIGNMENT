<p>He was born in the <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galata.html" title="Galata">Galata</a> district (today <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karak%C3%B6y.html" title="Karaköy">Karaköy</a> neighborhood) of <a href="../../../i/s/t/Istanbul.html" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>, in today's <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>. His father, Louis Chénier, a native of <a href="../../../l/a/n/Languedoc.html" title="Languedoc">Languedoc</a>, after twenty years in the <a href="../../../l/e/v/Levant.html" title="Levant">Levant</a> as a cloth-merchant, was appointed to a position equivalent to that of French <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consulate_general.html" title="Consulate general">consul</a> at Istanbul. His mother, Elisabeth Santi-Lomaca, whose sister was grandmother of <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolphe_Thiers_18fb.html" title="Adolphe Thiers">Adolphe Thiers</a>, was a <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greek</a>.<a href="http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:P_BtTSC7oe4J:oldpoetry.com/oauthor/show/Andre_Marie_de_Chenier+Elizabeth+Santi-Lomaca&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:P_BtTSC7oe4J:oldpoetry.com/oauthor/show/Andre_Marie_de_Chenier+Elizabeth+Santi-Lomaca&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> When André was three years old, his father returned to France, and from <a href="../../../1/7/6/1768.html" title="1768">1768</a> to <a href="../../../1/7/7/1775.html" title="1775">1775</a> served as consul-general of France in <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morocco.html" title="Morocco">Morocco</a>. The family, of which André was the third son, and Marie-Joseph (see below) the fourth, remained in France; and after a few years, during which André ran wild with an aunt in <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carcassonne.html" title="Carcassonne">Carcassonne</a>, he distinguished himself as a verse-translator from the classics at the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Coll%C3%A8ge_de_Navarre_8f09.html" title="Collège de Navarre">Collège de Navarre</a> (the school in former days of <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Gerson_391d.html" title="Jean Gerson">Jean Gerson</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacques-B%C3%A9nigne_Bossuet_8422.html" title="Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet">Bossuet</a>) in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/7/8/1783.html" title="1783">1783</a> he obtained a cadetship in a French regiment at <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strasbourg.html" title="Strasbourg">Strasbourg</a>, but the novelty soon wore off. He returned to Paris before the end of the year, was well received by his family, and mixed in the cultivated circle which frequented the <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salon_%28gathering%29.html" title="Salon (gathering)">salon</a> of his mother, among them <a href="../../../p/o/n/Ponce_Denis_%C3%89couchard_Lebrun_4964.html" title="Ponce Denis Écouchard Lebrun">Lebrun-Pindare</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antoine_Lavoisier_821a.html" title="Antoine Lavoisier">Lavoisier</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Fran%C3%A7ois_Lesueur_62c3.html" title="Jean François Lesueur">Lesueur</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claude_Joseph_Dorat_3273.html" title="Claude Joseph Dorat">Dorat</a>, Parmy, and a little later the painter <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacques-Louis_David_3f80.html" title="Jacques-Louis David">Jacques-Louis David</a>.</p>
<p>He had already chosen his vocation as a poet, and was steeped in the classical archaism of the time, when, in 1784, his taste for the antique was confirmed by a visit to <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a> in the company of two school friends, the brothers Trudaine. From <a href="../../../n/a/p/Naples.html" title="Naples">Naples</a>, after visiting <a href="../../../p/o/m/Pompeii.html" title="Pompeii">Pompeii</a>, he returned to Paris, his mind fermenting with poetic images and projects, few of which he was destined to realize. For nearly three years, however, he was enabled to study and to experiment in verse without any active pressure or interruption from his family — three precious years in which the first phase of his art as a writer of <a href="../../../i/d/y/Idyll.html" title="Idyll">idylls</a> and <a href="../../../b/u/c/Bucolic.html" title="Bucolic">bucolics</a>, imitated to a large extent from <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theocritus.html" title="Theocritus">Theocritus</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/o/Bion.html" title="Bion">Bion</a> and the Greek anthologists, was elaborated.</p>
<p>Among the poems written or at least sketched during this period were <i>L'Oaristys</i>, <i>L'Aveugle</i>, <i>La Jeune Malode</i>, <i>Bacchus</i>, <i>Euphrosine</i> and <i>La Jeune Tarentine</i>, the last a synthesis of his purest manner, mosaic though it is of reminiscences of at least a dozen classical poets. As in glyptic so in poetic art, the <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hellenism_%28neoclassicism%29.html" title="Hellenism (neoclassicism)">Hellenism</a> of the time was decadent and <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandrine.html" title="Alexandrine">Alexandrine</a> rather than Attic of the best period. But Chénier is always far more than animitator. <i>La Jeune Tarentine</i> is a work of personal emotion and inspiration. The colouring is that of classic mythology, but the spiritual element is as individual as that of any classical poem by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Milton_a919.html" title="John Milton">Milton</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Gray_585d.html" title="Thomas Gray">Gray</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Keats_3200.html" title="John Keats">Keats</a> or <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Lord_Tennyson_1595.html" title="Alfred Lord Tennyson">Tennyson</a>.</p>
<p>Apart from his idylls and his elegies, Chénier also experimented from early youth in didactic and philosophic verse, and when he commenced his <i>Hermes</i> in 1783 his ambition was to condense the <i><a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclop%C3%A9die.html" title="Encyclopédie">Encyclopédie</a></i> of <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denis_Diderot_b378.html" title="Denis Diderot">Denis Diderot</a> into a poem somewhat after the manner of <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucretius.html" title="Lucretius">Lucretius</a>. This poem was to treat of man's position in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universe.html" title="Universe">Universe</a>, first in an isolated state, and then in society. It remains fragmentary, and though some of the fragments are fine, its attempt at scientific exposition approximates too closely to the manner of <a href="../../../e/r/a/Erasmus_Darwin_aa40.html" title="Erasmus Darwin">Erasmus Darwin</a> to suit a modern ear. Another fragment called <i>L'Invention</i> sums Chénier's <i>Ars Poetica</i> in the verse "Sur des pensers nouveaux, faisons des vers antiques." <i>Suzanne</i> represents the torso of a Biblical poem on a very large scale, in six <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canto.html" title="Canto">cantos</a>.</p>
<p>In the meantime, André had published nothing, and some of these last pieces were in fact not yet written, when in November 1787 an opportunity of a fresh career presented itself. The new ambassador at the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Court_of_St._James%27s_77d7.html" title="Court of St. James's">Court of St. James's</a>, M. de la Luzerne, was connected in some way with the Chénier family, and he offered to take André with him as his secretary. The offer was too good to be refused, but the poet hated himself on the banks of the <i>fière Tamise</i>, and wrote in bitter ridicule of "Ces Anglais. Nation toute à vendre à qui peut la payer. De contrée en contrée allant au monde entier, Offrir sa joie ignoble et son faste grossier." He seems to have been interested in the poetic diction of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Milton_a919.html" title="John Milton">John Milton</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Thomson_%28Seasons%29_813d.html" title="James Thomson (Seasons)">James Thomson</a>, and a few of his verses are remotely inspired by <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Shakespeare_c1d2.html" title="William Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> and Thomas Gray. To say, however, that he studied English literature would be an exaggeration.</p>
<p>The events of <a href="../../../1/7/8/1789.html" title="1789">1789</a> and the startling success of his younger brother, Marie-Joseph, as political <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playwright.html" title="Playwright">playwright</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/m/Pamphleteer.html" title="Pamphleteer">pamphleteer</a>, concentrated all his thoughts upon France. In April 1790 he could stand London no longer, and once more joined his parents at Paris in the rue de Cléry. The France that he plunged into with such impetuosity was upon the verge of <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anomie.html" title="Anomie">anarchy</a>. A strong constitutionalist, Chénier took the view that the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Revolution_970a.html" title="French Revolution">Revolution</a> was already complete and that all that remained to be done was the inauguration of the reign of law. Moderate as were his views and disinterested as were his motives, his tactics were passionately and dangerously aggressive. From an idyllist and elegist we find him suddenly transformed into an unsparing master of poetical <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satire.html" title="Satire">satire</a>. His prose <i>Avis au peuple Iran Qais</i> (<a href="../../../a/u/g/August_24.html" title="August 24">August 24</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/9/1790.html" title="1790">1790</a>) was followed by the rhetorical <i>Jeu de paume</i>, a somewhat declamatory moral ode addressed to the painter David.</p>
<p>In the meantime he orated at the <a href="../../../f/e/u/Feuillant.html" title="Feuillant">Feuillants</a> Club, and contributed frequently to the <i>Journal de Paris</i> from November 1791 to July 1792, when he wrote his scorching <a href="../../../i/a/m/Iambe.html" title="Iambe">iambes</a> to <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Marie_Collot_d%27Herbois_64b0.html" title="Jean Marie Collot d'Herbois">Collot d'Herbois</a>, <i>Sur les Suisses révoltés du regiment de Châteauvieux</i>. The <a href="../../../1/0/t/10th_of_August_%28French_Revolution%29_2000.html" title="10th of August (French Revolution)">insurrection</a> of <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_10.html" title="August 10">August 10</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/9/1792.html" title="1792">1792</a> uprooted his party, his paper and his friends, and the management of relatives who kept him out of the way in <a href="../../../n/o/r/Normandy.html" title="Normandy">Normandy</a> alone saved him from the <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_Massacres_bae7.html" title="September Massacres">September Massacres</a>. In the month following these events his democratic brother, Marie-Joseph, had entered the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Convention_c93e.html" title="National Convention">Convention</a>. André's sombre rage against the course of events found vent in the line on the <a href="../../../m/a/e/Maenads.html" title="Maenads">Maenads</a> who mutilated the king's Swiss Guard, and in the <i>Ode a <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlotte_Corday_f6b1.html" title="Charlotte Corday">Charlotte Corday</a></i> congratulating France that "Un scélérat de moins rampe dans cette fange." At the express request of <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guillaume-Chr%C3%A9tien_de_Lamoignon_de_Malesherbes_fe12.html" title="Guillaume-Chrétien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes">Malesherbes</a> he provided some arguments to the materials collected for the defence of the king.</p>
<p>After the king's execution he sought a secluded retreat on the Plateau de Satory at <a href="../../../v/e/r/Versailles.html" title="Versailles">Versailles</a> and only went out after nightfall. There he wrote the poems inspired by Fanny (Mme Laurent Lecoulteux), including the exquisite <i>Ode à Versailles</i>, one of his freshest, noblest and most varied poems. His solitary life at Versailles lasted nearly a year. On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_7.html" title="March 7">March 7</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/9/1794.html" title="1794">1794</a> he was arrested at the house of Mme Piscatory at <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passy.html" title="Passy">Passy</a>. Two obscure agents of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Committee_of_Public_Safety_40cd.html" title="Committee of Public Safety">Committee of Public Safety</a> were in search of a marquise who had flown, but an unknown stranger was found in the house and arrested on suspicion of being the aristocrat that the were searching for. This was Chenier, who had come on a visit of sympathy.</p>
<p>He was taken to the <a href="../../../l/u/x/Luxembourg_Palace_ecaf.html" title="Luxembourg Palace">Luxembourg</a> and afterwards to Saint-Lazare. During the 140 days of his imprisonment there he wrote the marvellous iambes (in alternate lines of 12 and 8 syllables), which, in the words of the 1911 <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>, "hiss and stab like poisoned bullets," and which were transmitted to his family by a venal gaoler. There he wrote the best known of all his verses, the pathetic <i>Jeune captive</i>, a poem at once of enchantment and of despair. Suffocating in an atmosphere of cruelty and baseness, Chénier's agony found expression almost to the last in these murderous iambes which he launched against the Convention. Ten days before the end, the painter Joseph-Benoît Suvée completed the well-known portrait. He might have been overlooked but for the well-meant, indignant officiousness of his father. Marie-Joseph had done his best to prevent this, but he could do nothing more.</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/a/x/Maximilien_Robespierre_9f33.html" title="Maximilien Robespierre">Robespierre</a>, who was himself on the brink of the volcano, remembered the venomous sallies in the <i>Journal de Paris</i>. Chenier was one of the last persons that Robespierre had executed. At sundown, Chénier was taken by cart to the guillotine and with him was a Princess of Monaco who was guillotined with him on the very day of his condemnation on a bogus charge of conspiracy, André Chénier was <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guillotine.html" title="Guillotine">guillotined</a>. Three days later Robespierre, was seized and executed without trial ending the Terror.</p>
<p>The record of Chénier last moments by La Touche is rather melodramatic and is certainly not above suspicion. He was interred in the <a href="../../../c/i/m/Cimeti%C3%A8re_de_Picpus_587d.html" title="Cimetière de Picpus">Cimetière de Picpus</a>.</p>

<p>Incomplete as was his career — he was not quite thirty-two — his life was cut short in a crescendo of all its nobler elements. Exquisite as was already his susceptibility to beauty and his mastership of the rarest poetic material, we cannot doubt that Chénier was preparing for still higher flights of lyric passion and poetic intensity. Nothing that he had yet done could be said to compare in promise of assured greatness with the iambes, the <i>Odes</i> and the <i>Jeune Captive</i>. At the time of his death he left practically nothing to tell the world of his genius, and his reputation has had to be retrieved from oblivion page by page, and almost poem by poem.</p>
<p>During his lifetime only his <i>Jeu de paume</i> (1791) and <i>Hymne sur les Suisses</i> (1792) had been given to the world. The <i>Jeune Captive</i> appeared in the <i>Decade philosophique</i>, Jan. 9, 1795; <i>La Jeune Tarentine</i> in the <i>Mercure</i> of <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_22.html" title="March 22">March 22</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/0/1801.html" title="1801">1801</a>. <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fran%C3%A7ois-Ren%C3%A9_de_Chateaubriand_4000.html" title="François-René de Chateaubriand">Chateaubriand</a> quoted three or four passages in his <i>Genie du christianisme</i>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../f/a/y/Fayette.html" title="Fayette">Fayette</a> and Lefeuvre-Deumier also gave a few fragments; but it was not until 1819 that an attempt was made by <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henri_de_Latouche_87ae.html" title="Henri de Latouche">Henri de Latouche</a> to collect the poems in a substantive volume. Since the appearance of the <i><a href="../../../e/d/i/Editio_princeps.html" title="Editio princeps">editio princeps</a></i> of Chénier's poems in La Touche's volume, many additional poems and fragments have been discovered, and an edition of the complete works of the poet, collated with the manuscripts bequeathed to the Bibliothèque Nationale by Mme Elisa de Chénier in 1892, has been edited by Paul Dimoff and published by Delagrave.</p>
<p>During the same period the critical estimates of the poet have fluctuated in a truly extraordinary manner. <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Augustin_Sainte-Beuve_4190.html" title="Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve">Sainte-Beuve</a> in his <i>Tableau</i> of 1828 sang the praises of Chénier as an heroic forerunner of the Romantic movement and a precursor of <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victor_Hugo_5093.html" title="Victor Hugo">Victor Hugo</a>. Chénier, he said, had "inspired and determined" <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanticism.html" title="Romanticism">Romanticism</a>. This suggestion of modernity in Chénier was echoed by a chorus of critics who worked the idea to death; in the meantime, the standard edition of Chénier's works was being prepared by M. Becq de Fouquiéres and was issued in 1862, but rearranged and greatly improved by the editor in 1872. The same patient investigator gave his <i>New Documents on André Chénier</i> to the world in 1875.</p>
<p>In the second volume of <i>La Vie littéraire</i> <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anatole_France_f1a1.html" title="Anatole France">Anatole France</a> contests the theory of Sainte-Beuve. Far from being an initiator, he maintains that Chénier's poetry is the last expression of an expiring form of art. His matter and his form belong of right to the classic spirit of the 18th century. He is a contemporary, not of Hugo and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles-Marie-Ren%C3%A9_Leconte_de_Lisle_1ac3.html" title="Charles-Marie-René Leconte de Lisle">Leconte de Lisle</a>, but of Suard and <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andr%C3%A9_Morellet_6fa8.html" title="André Morellet">Morellet</a>. <a href="../../../%C3%A9/m/i/%C3%89mile_Faguet_8656.html" title="Émile Faguet">Émile Faguet</a> sums up on the side of M. France in his volume on the <a href="../../../1/8/t/18th_century.html" title="18th century">18th century</a> (1890). Chénier's real disciples, according to the latest view, are Leconte de Lisle and <a href="../../../j/o/s/Jos%C3%A9_Mar%C3%ADa_de_Heredia_869f.html" title="José María de Heredia">M. de Heredia</a>, <i>mosaistes</i> who have at heart the cult of antique and pagan beauty, of "pure art" and of "objective poetry." Heredia himself reverted to the judgment of Sainte-Beuve to the effect that Chénier was the first to make modern verses, and he adds, "I do not know in the French language a more exquisite fragment than the three hundred verses of the <i>Bucoliques</i>." Chénier's influence has been specially remarkable in <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a>, where his last hours became the subject of an important poem by <a href="../../../a/l/e/Aleksandr_Pushkin_00db.html" title="Aleksandr Pushkin">Pushkin</a> (1825), while <a href="../../../i/v/a/Ivan_Kozlov_1a72.html" title="Ivan Kozlov">Ivan Kozlov</a> translated <i>La Jeune Captive</i>, <i>La Jeune Tarentine</i> and other famous pieces.</p>
<p>The general French verdict on his work is in the main well summed by Morillot, when he says that, judged by the usual tests of the Romantic movement of the 1820s (love for strange literatures of the North, medievalism, novelties and experiments), Chénier would inevitably have been excluded from the <i>cénacle</i> of 1821, On the other hand he brought to the world ennui and melancholy which were among the early symptoms of the movement, and he experimented in French verse in a manner which would have led to his excommunication by the typical performers of the 18th century. What is universally admitted is that Chénier was a very great artist, who like <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre_de_Ronsard_684c.html" title="Pierre de Ronsard">Ronsard</a> opened up sources of poetry in France which had long seemed dried up. In England it is easier to feel his attraction than that of some far greater reputations in French poetry, for, rhetorical though he nearly always is, he yet reveals something of that quality which to the Northern mind has always been of the very essence of poetry, that quality which made Sainte-Beuve say of him, that he was the first great poet "<i>personnel et réveur</i>" in France since <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Fontaine_57ec.html" title="La Fontaine">La Fontaine</a>. His diction is still very artificial, the poetic diction of <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacques_Delille_dada.html" title="Jacques Delille">Delille</a> transformed in the direction of <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victor_Hugo_5093.html" title="Victor Hugo">Hugo</a>, but not very much. On the other hand, his descriptive power in treating of nature shows far more art than the Trianin school ever attained. His love of the woodland and his political fervour often remind us of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Percy_Bysshe_Shelley_d781.html" title="Percy Bysshe Shelley">Shelley</a>, and his delicate perception of Hellenic beauty, and the perfume of Greek legend, give us almost a foretaste of Keats. For these reasons, among others, Chénier, whose art is destined to so many vicissitudes of criticism in his own country, seems assured among English readers of a place among the <i>Dei Majores</i> of French poetry.</p>
<p>The Chénier literature of late years has become enormous. His fate has been commemorated in numerous plays, pictures and poems, notably in the opera <i><a href="../../../a/n/d/Andr%C3%A9_Ch%C3%A9nier_%28opera%29_f937.html" title="André Chénier (opera)">André Chénier</a></i> by <a href="../../../u/m/b/Umberto_Giordano_c8df.html" title="Umberto Giordano">Umberto Giordano</a>, the epilogue by <a href="../../../r/e/n/Ren%C3%A9_Fran%C3%A7ois_Armand_Sully-Prudhomme_a178.html" title="René François Armand Sully-Prudhomme">Sully-Prudhomme</a>, the <i>Stello</i> by <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_de_Vigny_5794.html" title="Alfred de Vigny">Alfred de Vigny</a>, the delicate statue by Puech in the Luxembourg, and the well-known portrait in the centre of the "Last Days of the Terror." The best editions are still those of <a href="../../../b/e/c/Becq_de_Fouqui%C3%A8res_c49c.html" title="Becq de Fouquières">Becq de Fouquières</a> (Paris, 1862, 1872 and 1881), though these are now supplemented by those of Louis Moland (2 vols., 1889) and R. Guillard (2 vols., 1899).</p>
