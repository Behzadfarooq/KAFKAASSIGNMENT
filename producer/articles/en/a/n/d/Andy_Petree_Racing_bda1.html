<p>The team was formed in 1985 by two brothers, Leo and Richard Jackson. The team debuted at that year's <a href="../../../d/a/y/Daytona_500.html" title="Daytona 500">Daytona 500</a> fielding two cars (the #55 sponsored by Copenhagen, and the #66 sponsored by Skoal Bandit) driven by another pair of brothers, <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benny_Parsons_9457.html" title="Benny Parsons">Benny</a> and <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phil_Parsons_29db.html" title="Phil Parsons">Phil Parsons</a>, respectively. Benny finished 31st and Phil finished 29th, both suffering engine failure. Phil ran fourteen races with the team that year and posted three top-tens while splitting time with another ride, and Benny ran fourteen races as well and had six top-ten finishes running a limited schedule. The two returned for 1986, with BP had four top tens and winning the team's first pole position. Phil ran a limited schedule himself and had five top-tens. After Benny left at the end of the year, it left a door open for Phil to take a full-time ride. In his first year with the #55, Parsons finished a then career-high 4th at <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martinsville_Speedway_3494.html" title="Martinsville Speedway">Martinsville</a> and finished 14th in points. The #66 ran only one race that year, with IndyCar driver <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Sneva_26b4.html" title="Tom Sneva">Tom Sneva</a> running at Daytona before dropping out with engine failure. In 1988, Parsons improved to a 9th place finish in points, with the highlight of his year coming with his victory at the <a href="../../../a/a/r/Aaron%27s_499.html" title="Aaron's 499">Winston 500</a> despite running out of fuel earlier in the race. In 1989 the team returned to a two car operation, signing <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Gant_3a06.html" title="Harry Gant">Harry Gant</a> and the <a href="../../../s/k/o/Skoal_Bandit_dc3b.html" title="Skoal Bandit">Skoal Bandit</a> sponsorship from <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hal_Needham_4177.html" title="Hal Needham">Hal Needham</a>'s <a href="../../../m/a/c/Mach_1_Racing_4451.html" title="Mach 1 Racing">Mach 1 Racing</a>. Gant would also take the #33 to his new team while Mach 1 ran the #66 in 1990. Gant won early in the season at <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darlington_Speedway_32c3.html" title="Darlington Speedway">Darlington Speedway</a> and finished seventh in points, while Parsons, despite additional sponsorship from Crown Petroleum, only had three top-tens and dropped to 21st in points. At the end of the year, Parsons left for <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morgan-McClure_Motorsports_8307.html" title="Morgan-McClure Motorsports">Morgan-McClure Motorsports</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990_in_NASCAR_7977.html" title="1990 in NASCAR">1990</a>, Richard Jackson splintered from the team to form his own operation, taking the equipment for the #55 with him. The newly re-named <i>Leo Jackson Motorsports</i> still held onto the #33 and Gant who won at <a href="../../../p/o/c/Pocono_Raceway_5c4b.html" title="Pocono Raceway">Pocono Raceway</a> but finished 17th in points that year. Phil Parsons also returned to the team briefly following his release from Morgan-McClure, pulling substitute duty for Gant at <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol_Motor_Speedway_a3e4.html" title="Bristol Motor Speedway">Bristol Motor Speedway</a>. 1991 was much better for Gant, as he finished 3rd in points and won four consecutive races late in the season, which began a "Life Begins at 50" campaign because Gant was the oldest winner in the history of the sport. He followed that up with his final two career wins in 1992 and a fourth-place finish in points. In 1993 &amp; <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994_in_NASCAR_ee23.html" title="1994 in NASCAR">1994</a>, he didn't win but had a pole each year as well as an eleventh-place finish in points in 1993. During his retirement year in 1994, LJM began grooming his replacement, and <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Pressley_f478.html" title="Robert Pressley">Robert Pressley</a>, ran three races for the team in the #54 sponsored by <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manheim_Auctions_faab.html" title="Manheim Auctions">Manheim Auctions</a>. His best finish was 31st. He moved to the #33 full-time in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995_in_NASCAR_0298.html" title="1995 in NASCAR">1995</a>, where he posted a tenth-place at Bristol, and finished runner-up to <a href="../../../r/i/c/Ricky_Craven_0f53.html" title="Ricky Craven">Ricky Craven</a> for <a href="../../../n/a/s/NASCAR_Rookie_of_the_Year_6697.html" title="NASCAR Rookie of the Year">Rookie of the Year</a>. <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996_in_NASCAR_ae3d.html" title="1996 in NASCAR">1996</a> was a struggle for Pressley and the team, when Pressley was running decently before having to miss the first race at <a href="../../../d/o/v/Dover_International_Speedway_2e01.html" title="Dover International Speedway">Dover Downs</a>(he was replaced by <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greg_Sacks_1d1c.html" title="Greg Sacks">Greg Sacks</a>). Around this time, Jackson was contemplating retirement and began looking to sell the team. His buyer was his crew chief at the time, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Petree_3676.html" title="Andy Petree">Andy Petree</a>. After one race as an owner, he released Pressley and had <a href="../../../t/o/d/Todd_Bodine_4009.html" title="Todd Bodine">Todd Bodine</a> finish out the year for him.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Petree_Racing_bda1.html" title="Edit section: New Owner">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">New Owner</span></h2>
<p>For <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997_in_NASCAR_83c1.html" title="1997 in NASCAR">1997</a>, Petree selected four-time winner <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Schrader_5147.html" title="Ken Schrader">Ken Schrader</a> to be his driver. Schrader was solid all season long, as he won the pole at both <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Hampshire_International_Speedway_4115.html" title="New Hampshire International Speedway">Loudon</a> races and finished tenth in the points. <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998_in_NASCAR_12ae.html" title="1998 in NASCAR">1998</a> saw about the same result, with eight finishes of ninth or better, and two more pole positons. APR also expanded to a multi-car operation briefly, fielding the #55 Oakwood Homes Chevy driven by <a href="../../../h/u/t/Hut_Stricklin_6af1.html" title="Hut Stricklin">Hut Stricklin</a> at the <a href="../../../p/e/p/Pepsi_400.html" title="Pepsi 400">Pepsi 400</a>. The team became a multi-car full time in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999_in_NASCAR_5d8b.html" title="1999 in NASCAR">1999</a>, with <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenny_Wallace_dc0c.html" title="Kenny Wallace">Kenny Wallace</a> signing to drive the #55 car with sponsorship from <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schneider_Electric_c64b.html" title="Schneider Electric">Square D</a>. The year was up and down for Wallace, as he posted a career-best second-place finish at Loudon, but could only muster a 22nd-place points finish. Meanwhile at the #33 camp, NASCAR's community was shocked when long-time sponsor Skoal announced it would no longer continue its association with the #33. After the team signed Oakwood Homes to be a full-time sponsor on the car, Schrader announced he would leave to pursue other opportunities. After a long search, APR decided to hire <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Nemechek_ba32.html" title="Joe Nemechek">Joe Nemechek</a> to pilot the car. While he didn't visit victory lane at all in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000_in_NASCAR_e59d.html" title="2000 in NASCAR">2000</a>, he did have three top-fives and the first top-25 points finish of his career. After nailing just one top-ten that year, Wallace announced he would leave for Eel River Racing. It wasn't long before <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Hamilton_8fbf.html" title="Bobby Hamilton">Bobby Hamilton</a> was named to handle the driving chores. When the 2000 season came to a close, APR fielded an unprecedented third team, the #35 for <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoffrey_Bodine_8765.html" title="Geoffrey Bodine">Geoffrey Bodine</a> at <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta_Motor_Speedway_959a.html" title="Atlanta Motor Speedway">Atlanta Motor Speedway</a>. <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001_in_NASCAR_cf40.html" title="2001 in NASCAR">2001</a> was a banner year for APR, as Hamilton won at <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talladega_Superspeedway_26fb.html" title="Talladega Superspeedway">Talladega Superspeedway</a> and finished eighteenth in points, while Nemechek had ups and downs, breaking a shoulder at Dover and being replaced by <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scott_Pruett_6dd0.html" title="Scott Pruett">Scott Pruett</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wally_Dallenbach%2C_Jr._4963.html" title="Wally Dallenbach, Jr.">Wally Dallenbach, Jr.</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Hamilton_Jr._b845.html" title="Bobby Hamilton Jr.">Hamilton's son</a>. When he returned from his injuries, Nemechek was able to rebound with a victory <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Carolina_Speedway_83be.html" title="North Carolina Speedway">North Carolina Speedway</a> and had a respectable 28th place finish in points. Unfortunately, Oakwood Homes had financial trouble and backed out as sponsor, and Nemechek teamed up with <a href="../../../t/r/a/Travis_Carter_Motorsports_e936.html" title="Travis Carter Motorsports">Travis Carter Motorsports</a> in 2002.</p>

<p>Oakwood Homes' financial troubles left the #33 without a sponsor for <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002_in_NASCAR_0f76.html" title="2002 in NASCAR">2002</a>. <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Wallace_%28NASCAR%29_72f4.html" title="Mike Wallace (NASCAR)">Mike</a> and Kenny Wallace ran limited schedules in the car, but no full-time sponsor could be located. In addition to all the turmoil, several attempts to get <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Jones_4a52.html" title="Jerry Jones">Jerry Jones</a> to buy into the team failed. Things went from bad to worse in the #55, where Hamilton, who was struggling intensely, suffered a broken shoulder in a crash. <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Hornaday_71c8.html" title="Ron Hornaday">Ron Hornaday</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greg_Biffle_87a5.html" title="Greg Biffle">Greg Biffle</a> were able to fill in, but despite a tenth-place finish in the season finale, Hamilton was not happy, and he departed to the <a href="../../../c/r/a/Craftsman_Truck_Series_fb06.html" title="Craftsman Truck Series">Craftsman Truck Series</a>, taking the Square D sponsorship with him. <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Fittipaldi_9bcb.html" title="Christian Fittipaldi">Christian Fittipaldi</a> signed to drive the #33 at the <a href="../../../d/a/y/Daytona_500.html" title="Daytona 500">Daytona 500</a>, and he finished 35th. The team made only one other race that year, with <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Menard_d687.html" title="Paul Menard">Paul Menard</a> at <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watkins_Glen_International_Raceway_92ac.html" title="Watkins Glen International Raceway">Watkins Glen International Raceway</a>, where he finished 29th. In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_in_NASCAR_Busch_Series_2c44.html" title="2004 in NASCAR Busch Series">2004</a>, Menard and Petree ran in the <a href="../../../b/u/s/Busch_Series_8aef.html" title="Busch Series">Busch Series</a> in the hopes of attracting major sponsorship for the team's planned return to the Cup series, but Menard signed a contract with <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dale_Earnhardt%2C_Inc._2dcb.html" title="Dale Earnhardt, Inc.">Dale Earnhardt, Inc.</a>, and took the sponsorship from his father's company with him. This was the final blow to APR, and despite running a couple of truck series races, Petree auctioned off all of his equipment, and the team is now dead.</p>
