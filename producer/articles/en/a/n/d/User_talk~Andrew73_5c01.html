<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew73_5c01.html" title="Edit section: Commercial Links">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Commercial Links</span></h2>
<p>Dear Mdwyer, Dirk Beestra, and others,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for providing Dr. Doyle (AKA DrBird or 71.245.157.18) an explanation of your intentions re commercial links on Wikipedia, which I have now reviewed.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is a valuable Web resource, and our firm takes very seriously the need for the Wikipedia site to objectively serve the needs of its primary audience.</p>
<p>I would like to offer some comments here that are intended to be constructive for all concerned.</p>
<p>A. Level Playing Field. I am sure you would agree that there should be a level playing field for all parties on Wikipedia. If commercial links are permitted for any firms, then such links should be permitted for all firms. If commercial links are denied to some firms, than all firms should be denied such links.</p>
<p>B. Factual Errors. Though I understand the concept underlying your attempts to distinguish "discoverers" and/or "manufacturers" from mere "resellers" regarding biochemical reagents such as Geldanamycin, Leptomycin B, Sirolimus and Tacrolimus, etc., please note that you have not been successful at distinguishing these correctly.</p>
<p>C. Regarding "discovery":</p>
<p>--Geldanamcyin was discovered 36 years ago by the former Upjohn Company (Kalamazoo, MI) in cultures of a fungus from a Kalamazoo soil sample: J. Antibiotics, Vol. 23, pp. 442-447 (1970)</p>
<p>--Leptomycin B was discovered twice, independently, by Japanese workers [J. Antibiot., Vol. 36, pp. 639-645 (1983)] and at about the same time by the former Warner-Lambert Company, as subsequently reported [U.S. Patent No. 4,771,070]. This patent was applied for in 1986, and the actual work was probably carried out several years earlier.</p>
<p>--Sirolimus (a.k.a Rapamycin) was discovered in 1975 by Ayerst Research Laboratories (Montreal) in a soil fungus from Easter Island: J. Antibiot., Vol. 28, pp. 721-726 (1975).</p>
<p>--Tacrolimus (a.k.a. FK-506) was discovered by the Fujisawa Company, as reported in Euro. Patent No. EP184162 and J. Antibiot., Vol. 40, pp. 1249ff (1987).</p>
<p><br />
D. Regarding "manufacturing": there are about 75 purveyors worldwide, including our firm, LC Laboratories, that sell products of this type. Some, such as Sigma and Calbiochem, sell tens of thousands of such products, a small percentage of which they manufacture themselves. Some, such as AG Scientific, have essentially no manufacturing capability whatsoever; they are only repackagers and resellers.</p>
<p>Here at LC Laboratories we manufacture essentially all of our very small list of products (about 100) ourselves. Even for those very few products that we buy and resell, we take on inherent responsibility for the product by conducting substantial purity and quality testing ourselves; this is necessary and is a substantial benefit to our customers because the sources of such compounds (various Asian countries, for example) are often highly questionable regarding quality. To the best of my knowledge, AG Scientific does not carry out any quality testing itself on the products it resells. To confirm this you would need to contact Mr. A.G. "Chip" Lindgren, the founder of AG Scientific.</p>
<p>E. Regarding "reselling": as noted to some extent in the previous paragraph, it is not a given that "reselling" is a trivial activity. There are literally thousands of sources of biochemical reagent sources around the world -- small academic labs, scientists literally making things in their cellars or garages, small primary manufacturers like LC Laboratories, larger primary manufacturers such as Sigma's RBI division, etc.</p>
<p>I would like to emphasize that even the resellers are providing essential services and value to the 180,000-odd biomedical researchers around the world. By collecting many important compounds into a single catalog or Web source, even pure resellers such as AG Scientific are providing valuable efficiency to its customers, enabling them to quickly locate and obtain reagents for their studies.</p>
<p>F. More about "discoverers": I can assure you that exactly zero of the "small-molecule" reagents sold by the ca. 75 biochemical vendors alluded to above, reagents such as the four I have already listed, or the 100-odd in the LC Labs catalog, or the many thousands of small-molecule products in Sigma's or Calbiochem's catalog, were discovered by these vendors. Again for emphasis: NONE. Compounds of these types are discovered by drug companies and, to a very much smaller extent, by academic laboratories.</p>
<p>[Sooner or later LC Labs will become an exception -- we will begin selling some compounds that we have discovered ourselves. Unlike other biochemical vendors, we also do pharmaceutical discovery research. LC Labs is a division of PKC Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and we are close to releasing some of our non-clinical, proprietary compounds to the research reagent marketplace, to enable other researchers to benefit from our discoveries (US Patent Nos. 5,643,948, 5,716,968, 5,750,568, 5,886,017, 5,886,019, 5,891,870, 5,891,906, 5,955,501, 5,962,498, 6,043,270, 6,080,784, etc. &amp; foreign equivalents)].</p>
<p>G. LC Labs in particular: by trying to selectively block our commercial links on Wikipedia, you are strongly dis-serving biomedical researchers. As our home page notes, we are the highest-quality, lowest-priced supplier of every product in our product list (there might be 1-3 exceptions in certain currencies). In some cases our prices get down to 1/50th or 1/100th of those charged by firms like AG Scientific or Fermentek. You can verify these claims for yourself; we provide price comparison tables for all of our products vs. our competitors: <a href="http://www.lclabs.com/PriceComparisons.php4" class="external free" title="http://www.lclabs.com/PriceComparisons.php4" rel="nofollow">http://www.lclabs.com/PriceComparisons.php4</a> See sirolimus (rapamycin) in particular: <a href="http://www.lclabs.com/PrC/R-5000prcompUS.php4" class="external free" title="http://www.lclabs.com/PrC/R-5000prcompUS.php4" rel="nofollow">http://www.lclabs.com/PrC/R-5000prcompUS.php4</a></p>
<p>H. To wrap things up here: I and our IT team are strongly committed to the level playing field concept. On Wikipedia, for us this is something of a self-appointed role, much as your role of "link-remover" based on factual errors appears to have been a self-appointed role.</p>
<p>We will leave it to you to decide where you think this situation ought to go. If you think commercial links should be allowed for the important biomedical research reagents in question here, then we will insist that ours be allowed and will take all necessary steps to achieve that. If you decide "no commercial links", then we will assist you by automating the removal of all of same from the relevant Wikipedia entries, because we absolutely will not accept any discrimination between firms on any basis.</p>
<p><br />
In closing, let me again thank you for stepping forward with an explanation of your viewpoint; I hope my offering here in return is received in the constructive way that it is intended. My associates and I look forward to resolving this particular topic to everyone's satisfaction.</p>
<p><br />
Sincerely,</p>
<p>Paul E. Driedger, Ph.D. General Manager of LC Laboratories; President of PKC Pharmaceuticals, Inc.</p>

The substantiations You can find in the article discussions.

<p><i>A sedan is a specific type of car, in the same way that a convertible is a specific type of car. A laser printer is specific type of printer.</i> <b>In the same way, First Clinical Syndrome is seen ONLY in First Clinical Years</b>. If some one else (not in first clinical) suffers, it is NOT first Clinical Syndrome. A lump in the neck, whether you in India or in the U.S., both raises the same possible hypochondria concerns. But when raises hypochondria concerns in the first clinical year, we call that as First Clinical Syndrome. When that raises hypochondria during other time, it is NOT first clinical syndrome, but Medical Student Syndrome.</p>
<p>To Summarise</p>
<ul>
<li>Medical Student Syndrome can be seen in any country</li>
<li>First Clinical Syndrome is seen in India</li>
<li>Medical Student Syndrome can be seen during any time</li>
<li>First Clinical Syndrome is seen during First Clinical Year.</li>
</ul>
<p>All cases of First Clinical Syndrome are cases of Medical Syndrome (all sedans are cars and all laser printers are printers), but NOT ALL cases of Medical Student Syndrome are cases of First Clinical Syndrome (not all cars are sedans and not all printers are laser printers).</p>
<p>So, We can merge this only when you are merging Laser Printer with Printer and Sedan with car. I am not making a <b>point</b>, but just trying to give you an example.</p>

<p><b>No Need to push further</b>. If we push further will will end up in saying that we don't need articles for Laser Printer as it is a subset of Printer and Sedan as it is a subset of Car. I think I have given enough examples. Any how, a Sedan is a specific type of Car, a laser printer is a specific type of printer and First Clinical Syndrome is a specific type of Hypochondriasis and hence a special article is needed. If you feel that those examples are off the mark, let me give examples from medicine itself. Since Medical Student Syndrome is a subset of <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypochondria.html" title="Hypochondria">hypochondria</a> and since <a href="../../../c/y/b/Cyberchondria.html" title="Cyberchondria">Cyberchondria</a> also is a subset of <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypochondria.html" title="Hypochondria">hypochondria</a> can we merge both these along with <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypochondria.html" title="Hypochondria">hypochondria</a>. Why <a href="../../../c/s/b/WP%7ECSB_93c9.html" title="WP:CSB">it did not occur to you</a> that cyberchondria should be merged with hypochondria when the former is a subset of the latter. They all deserve their own article. I am sure that you will agree with me that "Medical Student Syndrome", "First Clinical Syndrome" and "Cyberchondria" need separate articles. Please take a look at Brain_fag, <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fan_death.html" title="Fan death">Fan_death</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windigo.html" title="Windigo">Windigo</a> where we have articles based on such entities which are limited to one small community. <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture-Bound_Syndrome_86a8.html" title="Culture-Bound Syndrome">Culture-Bound_Syndrome</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genital_retraction_syndrome.html#Southeast_Asia:_Koro" title="Genital retraction syndrome">Genital_retraction_syndrome#Southeast_Asia:_Koro</a> provide more insights. This should be treated like that only.

<dd>I think this is a matter of where you draw the line. However, if I may indulge a litte, I bet the viewpoint I propose is the more typical viewpoint. Furthermore, if I may appeal to google, there are 527 entries for "medical student syndrome." On the other hand, there's only one (or two) listings for "first clinical syndrome." The other listings do not refer to the specific entity of "first clinical syndrome." (In contrast, "cyberchondria" has over 10,000 listings.) <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew73_a1aa.html" title="User:Andrew73">Andrew73</a> 00:34, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><s>Dear Dr. Andrew,</s></p>
<p><s><s>We're both MD's. What do you think of making contributions to something else in wikipedia (besides medical topics)? Earlier today, I made a comment about the John Edwards (running for president).</s></s></p>
<p><s><s>There seems to be a fight going on there about Mrs. Edwards' cancer. John Edwards said (and I paraphrase) that the cancer is "completely treatable" and likened it to diabetes (probably because both are not curable, but treatable).</s></s></p>
<p><s><s>Some argue that Edwards is being deceptive and putting too much of a spin. There was a mention that being misleading is potentially harmful to the public because someone else with breast cancer might misunderstand and think that her prognosis is good. They even wanted to put grim prognosis numbers. Some others thought that "original research" and "soapboxing" is not permitted in wikipedia and they wanted to put just the info from the glossy Edwards press reports.</s></s></p>
<p><s><s>I take a neutral stance in between.</s></s></p>
<p><s><s>The problem I see is that is it potentially bad to write about this type of comment? Some doctors in wikipedia stick to medicine but others do not. I don't want to get into a fight between a bunch of Democrats and Republicans. What's your experience making edits like Anna Nicole Smith and other non-medical stuff? What I wrote--is it a reasonable compromise of the waring sides?</s></s></p>
<p><s><s>Best regards, Frank (Doc United States) Here's the link <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:John_Edwards" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:John_Edwards" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> My part is near or at the bottom called "A Response from a Physician"<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_United_States_f028.html" title="User:Doc United States">Doc United States</a> 22:26, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</s></s></p>
