<p>I have just come across your comments on this article. Basically, you're right, and thanks for the edits, which did indeed improve on the previous versions. To answer your specific questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>The definition of a transition metal is still controversial, dispite <a href="../../../i/u/p/IUPAC_2cc4.html" title="IUPAC">IUPAC</a> guidelines. The article is still not completely internally consistant, and I shall try to get round that without offending any of the (many) opposing camps!</li>
<li>There are <b>four</b> periods of transition metals in total, whatever definition you choose, but all elements of the fourth period are radioactive and most do not have any substantial chemistry.</li>
</ol>

<dd>I think it would be better to NPOV it and add the other relevant countries. Australia is a major supplier of uranium, as is Canada, so I think their politics are relevant to this article. So are those of France, not currently mentioned at all in the article when I looked before.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>France is a major exporter of nuclear electricity to those closing their nuclear industries, of course, and it's hard to imagine them not continuing and expanding these exports, and even harder to imagine them going back to imported fossil fuel to do it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think this could be a very good article, but I also suspect that some of its authors would then either need to change their views or would want it deleted. It should give an accurate picture of the scope and success of the movement.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The scope means confined to the mainstream politics of some European countries, and the fringe politics of some others. Among the industrial economies of Asia, there's no talk of nuclear phase-out: Japan, China, India, Taiwan and South Korea all see expanding nuclear power as one of their key economic objectives; Malaysia and Indonesia both have an active interest in starting programs; Hong Kong is now part of China. This is very relevant surely.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The success means looking at the balance of closures versus new and upgraded capacity, which isn't mentioned by the current article, and also looking accurately at the results, which are selectively quoted. There's no mention of the transfer of generating capacity to fossil fuel, which is what has happened to Sweden, or to countries with continuing nuclear programs, which has what has happened to Germany and Italy. There's no mention of the Philippines, the only Asian country to have yet implemented nuclear phase-out. This is also relevant IMO.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>Hmmm, I don't agree in this case. What I requested was that people didn't edit an <b>empty</b> section which I had created, headed <i>my proposal</i>, on a talk page. The heading and message were <b>all</b> that were in this section for that entire time. It's an adversarial situation, and I wanted to avoid the ettiquette quandry if someone had inserted something sarcastic. Was that really unreasonable? What would they have wanted to add to it, anyway?</dd>
</dl>

<dd>Adding the header without any text is a pretty standard technique and a good one.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'd only intended the message, which was initially a request for 60 minutes, to be there for 15 minutes or less. I actually had the text ready in an offline Word file (user pages are not <i>private</i>), but other things distracted me (unavoidably) and when I returned I found I wanted to make more changes, and was running late for work. I suppose at this stage I could have temporarily deleted the new section, but as I said I don't think the 4 hour request was unreasonable. (I didn't quite make it, if you check the history.)</dd>

<p>Thanks for the reference to an interesting article. The popular Australian attitude to the nuclear power lifecycle industries puzzles me. The timing in the article is confusing - <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Ministers_of_Australia_86ac.html" title="Prime Ministers of Australia">Prime Ministers of Australia</a> says that <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Gorton_4f82.html" title="John Gorton">John Gorton</a> handed over to [[William McMahon] on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_10.html" title="March 10">10 March</a> <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a>. I'm not quite sure if this fits the timeline for the change of prime minister having the effect of further deferring the project by a year which seems to have happened in 1970. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 10:54, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think you're right, the first deferall was by the Gorton cabinet, not the McMahon one. I will double-check that, and see whether I can unearth the reasons. McMahon is reported to have said to the AAEC something along the lines of <i>how can I build this when I need to cut child care places in the same budget</i>. The first deferral is a bit more puzzling. Thank you!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think the problem is that there is no <i>popular Australian attitude</i>. Nuclear matters are only really on the political horizon for a relative few, but owing to our compulsory voting system we all need to make up our minds occasionally. I support our system, this consequence has some positives. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 20:11, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We seem to have plenty of space to store the waste, or better still open up a reprocessing business. But too many people think it's not a good idea. I've never heard the reason why we can't just shove the waste back in the hole the Uranium came out of in the first place, either. After all, if we hadn't disturbed it, it would be there anyway. <a href="../../../o/k/l/Oklo.html" title="Oklo">Oklo</a> is an interesting article about a natural reactor, too. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 04:37, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If I had my way, Australia would be the biggest supplier of PWR fuel in the world. But we wouldn't sell it, we'd lease it. We wouldn't just agree to take the spent fuel back, we'd demand it back. No proliferation risk. Put the fuel elements back into the ground, as you say. Sweden has an excellent copper encapsulation technology for that. The cost would be factored into the fuel cost, and the customers would love it. In about 3000 years the spent fuel elements will be less radioactive than the original ore body was, if they stay there. But they won't stay there, we'll dig them up long before that to reprocess them into FBR fuel, which is not economic yet but will be. This is exactly the deal Russia is trying to sell to Iran, just BTW.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>The reason we can't do that? Politics. People really do believe that plutonium (which is 200 times less radiotoxic then natural radium) is the most dangerous substance known, that everyone is going to make bombs from their power reactors and not otherwise (the NPT nuclear weapons states all had bombs before they had power reactors) and that the waste will be dangerous for millions of years (which is true but very misleading, see above... the material was <b>already</b> dangerous, and won't be any <b>more</b> dangerous for nearly that long).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But the times are changing. I don't think we can claim a victory yet, but it's just possible that <a href="../../../g/e/n/Generational_change.html" title="Generational change">generational change</a> will see a postmodern <i>new green</i> movement that sees best-practice nuclear as very green indeed (as I have always done). The challenge will be China. I don't think the European greens have any idea how desperate for electrical capacity China is. Will they heed the lessons of Chernobyl, and do better than the USSR did? The French publicly warned the USSR in the 1950s that their plans for the RBMK would produce reactors that were inherently unstable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The environmental movement has a role in watching this, and they can't do it if they regard all nukes as absolutely evil. Some are better than others. But if they start learning about that, they may even find that some of them are quite good already, and this will be something of an identity crisis.

<p>Sounds like you've researched the topic better than I have, but pretty much confirmed my opinions, too. I haven't heard a "greenie" opinion of the <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_Tower_Buronga_7bbc.html" title="Solar Tower Buronga">Solar Tower Buronga</a> yet. That could leave them a little confused, too — a 38 km² roof can't be all "clean and green", whether it's over natural desert/bush or farmland. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 11:25, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh, there's been some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Solar_Tower_Buronga&amp;diff=20763602&amp;oldid=20225338" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Solar_Tower_Buronga&amp;diff=20763602&amp;oldid=20225338" rel="nofollow">very eloquent</a> opinion expressed if you know where to look.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The greens' problem is, there's the risk that debate about this project will become quite a fight. The promoters already have some local government money. If they're lured into doing some honest arithmetic on energy generally, before you know it the figures on bombs, wastes and accidents will be scrutinised too, but this time by the mainstream greens themselves. And then the whole house of cards may come fluttering down.</dd>

<dd>As I've noted elsewhere, my personal interest in solar power goes back to 1962. As in, that's when I first used a hacksaw and hard-solder torch to help build a solar hot water service.

<p>I cannot at all fathom what you mean about GFDL in your comment... What does that have to do with anything? Also, please note I underlined the phrase "I stand by my delete" to reiterate it. Delete is really what I want to do. I know it's confusing... sorry.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please sign your posts here, Paul.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>, authors retain <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> of their work, and this is vital to the viral nature of the licence, which is what distinguishes <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyleft.html" title="Copyleft">copyleft</a> from <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_domain.html" title="Public domain">public domain</a>. Therefore we must keep a record of who those authors are, and at Wikipedia we do this mainly by the edit history. When two articles are merged, Wikipedia has regarded the GFDL as satisfied if the text from the two is merged by cut-and-paste and one of the articles then becomes a redirect to the other, thus preserving the edit histories of both. This is the background to the comment at <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#Commenting_on_a_listing_for_deletion" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy#Commenting on a listing for deletion</a> regarding preservation of the history, and some of the comments at <a href="../../../r/f/d/RfD_39ed.html" title="RfD">RfD</a> and elsewhere, to the effect that <i>significant history</i> must be preserved.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>We also see copyright as not applying to <i>information</i>, so if information is copied but rephrased, there's no GFDL issue. The thing that makes cut-and-paste important is that the <i>text</i> is copied, and the text is subject to copyright (as are lists, just BTW).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>With me so far?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>One complication: The author of the text is in a unique position, in that <i>they and only they</i> can cut and paste the text into another article without violating the GFDL. So having <a href="../../../r/e/f/Refactor.html" title="Refactor">refactored</a> the article as heavily as you have, it's probably quite valid for you to <i>do</i> this merge even if it would be a violation of the GFDL for anyone else to do it - maybe. The maybe here is, have you as the author authorised the merge by voting <i>merge and delete</i>? Let's not even go there! That would mean that your vote would be valid <i>until someone else edits the page</i> and perhaps not afterwards... yuck.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>IMO the only reasonable thing is just to say that <i>merge and delete</i> is not <b>ever</b> a valid VfD vote, but I lost that debate long ago. So things are a bit messy, and that's the reason IMO. Any clearer? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 16:27, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On reflection, there's another thing that confuses some people. The function of VfD is to authorise (or not) action by <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators_37b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators">administrators</a>, who have the authority to delete a page. So, there's no need to list something on VfD if the intention is to <i>merge and redirect</i>, as some do from time to time, because anyone can do that. Likewise, there's no need to list something on VfD if the intention is to stubify it. Anyone can do that, even anonymously. The only real decision to be made on VfD is to <i>keep</i> or <i>delete</i>. This means that <i>merge and redirect</i> is a variety of <i>keep</i> vote. On the other hand we've noted the problems with <i>merge and delete</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In view of these problems, my advice to those who want to vote <i>merge and delete</i> is as follows: Do the merge you propose yourself, immediately, without editing the page up for deletion. Nobody is stopping you and there is nothing in Wikipedia policy against it, provided you heed the GFDL requirements by either rephrasing in your own words or somehow preserving the significant history. Then vote <i>delete</i>, noting there what you've already done to preserve the useful content. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 21:32, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Andrew, thanks. A lot of information, and very helpful. Wow, I as the author only can authorize that. Amazing. I guess by that thinking, I could publish it under my name, as long as I did it under GFDL. I guess in my past vote and discussion, I have done just that. I'll do it myself once the facts are established. Or, maybe I'll just move the text to Brazil and leave a "fact" template tag there. But the page title -- we should just delete that altogether, IMO. A redirect? Waste of time.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Several things here.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Firstly, I don't see where she has moved text. I think it's just been copied, and I think the place it's been copied to is going to be deleted for other reasons anyway. Good nomination, BTW.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly, it's not <i>her</i> page. Even our own user subpages belong to the community, not to us. This will seem like I'm quibbling I guess, but it's an important principle. See <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_creed_111d.html" title="User:Andrewa/creed">user:andrewa/creed</a> for some of my thoughts on this.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Thirdly, personally I think there is a problem, but it's not one that the Wikipedia community has ever worried about. The attitude seems to be, as long as the edit history is preserved <i>somewhere</i>, the text can be reused anywhere in Wikipedia. I'm not comfortable with this, but it's a fairly subtle point and the consensus seems to be against me. So the policy in practice is, it's OK. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 07:30, 3 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Another question. Regarding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Swing_rhythm&amp;curid=2690494&amp;diff=23624463&amp;oldid=23624060" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Swing_rhythm&amp;curid=2690494&amp;diff=23624463&amp;oldid=23624060" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>, what publication of <i>Satin Doll</i> are you referring to? It's been published numerous time with numerous editorial comments.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Not sure of the edition, I just chose it as one of the many swing standards that I know I've read as 4/4, three authors I think on that sheet from memory, one of them the Duke of course. I'm assuming that they wouldn't have changed it from compound to simple time, so that's going to be the original published time signature. But it might easily have gone the other way; Do you know of any subsequent edition that was written out in compound time? That would be far more interesting. I think that possibly the <i>Real Books</i> took this approach for some standards at least, but I don't have them at my fingertips at present to check. I do know that I have seen standards written both ways over the years! I first learned <i>Black Coffee</i> from a version published in compound time for example.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Satin Doll</i> is probably readily available on the web. Or if you have a better example, feel free to use it instead. The citation could go into a <i>references</i> section if you have it handy.
<dl>
<dd>Maybe I didn't make myself clear. All editions of this song are in 4/4 (AFAIK), but it's the indication "medium swing" that you mentioned which I think might be editorial. Strayhorn wouldn't have felt the need to write such a thing down. What I'd like to keep straight in the <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swing_rhythm.html" title="Swing rhythm">Swing rhythm</a> article is a distinction between terms and concepts used by real jazz players, especially mid-century, and those used now by pedagogues dumbing things down for the masses. —<a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahoofive_09c2.html" title="User:Wahoofive">Wahoofive</a> (<a href="../../../w/a/h/User_talk%7EWahoofive_6e5c.html" title="User talk:Wahoofive">talk</a>) 15:30, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Firstly, in order to make this distinction, you'll need to decide who is a <i>real jazz player</i>. Again, I preach caution. It may be possible to decide this in an NPOV fashion for mid twentieth century players, but IMO it won't be possible to draw the line for more recent music. And even for mid twentieth century, have you for example listened to <i>Everydays</i>, a track on <i><a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_and_a_Word_753d.html" title="Time and a Word">Time and a Word</a></i>? If so, is it <i>real</i> jazz? If not, worth a listen. BTW, despite what the Wikipedia article says, don't expect to hear strings on this track! OK, it's <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz_fusion.html" title="Jazz fusion">jazz fusion</a>; Is that <i>real jazz</i>?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly, the term <i>swing</i> does <b>not</b> IMO belong exlusively to the jazz fraternity, whether that's going to include <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Bruford_586c.html" title="Bill Bruford">Bill Bruford</a> or not. Sorry! That's part of the problem here. We also need to cater for example for the dance fraternity. Some of them literally do not know a waltz from a march, even at a surprisingly high level (bitter and in hindsight hilarious experience), but they still manage to dance well once you figure out what they want.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And I think Wikipedia could be a little more helpful in this! Have a look at <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Coast_Swing_a4ab.html#Music" title="West Coast Swing">West Coast Swing#Music</a>.

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The English language fails us again! By <i>real jazz players</i> I meant <i>real players (of jazz)</i>, not <i>players of real jazz</i>. I realize the term can be used outside of jazz, and I wasn't intending to restrict in that way.</dd>

The article <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internal_combustion_engine.html" title="Internal combustion engine">Internal combustion engine</a> doesn't just say "it burns gas", even though that's how most people think of it, and that's how we'd explain it to a beginner; it gives a more specific technical description of the chemical reactions involved, based on expert understanding. The article <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a> doesn't say it's round, even though that's how I'd explain it to a beginner.

<dd>OK, I understand what you're saying now. You're saying that the earth isn't <i>exactly</i> round, so there's a sense in which the statement "the earth is round" isn't true, and an expert knows better? I think that's a bit of a stretch! "Round" in this sense doesn't mean "exactly circular". Similarly, a triplet doesn't mean "exactly a third" any more than a crotchet represents an <i>exact</i> interval of time. In all written music, you can't put <i>everything</i> on the chart. But to say 4/4 is four equal (as far as time is concerned) beats to the bar isn't dumbing it down. Experts say that too, and there's a very helpful sense in which it's <b>true</b>, even if it's not <b>exact</b> in some pedantic sense.</dd>

If you told someone "internal combustion engines run on gas", then I'm afraid I think you'd be misinforming them. It's true in a sense, but it's not the best way to say it, and is likely to be misunderstood. The article says they run on <i>fuel</i>, which is correct. In Australia, I might tell my five-year old niece "our car engine runs on petrol" (she speaks <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_English_375b.html" title="Australian English">Australian English</a> of course, and to us "gas" means <a href="../../../l/p/g/LPG_cc5b.html" title="LPG">LPG</a>), but nobody is suggesting that we write English Wikipedia articles like this I hope.

<dd>Yes, and this material should certainly be in the article. My view is that in some styles of music, particularly swing era music and shuffle rhythm dance music, the triplet time values are as close an approximation as any other time values in written music. This is also consistent with Grove.</dd>

<dd>Upon reading it again, I see that you meant both in English to apply to the examples you gave. However this is an English encyclopedia so that I would think would be assumed. Also, the way it was worded was confusing so I removed it. I hope you do not take offense. I like the intro you wrote though.

If a few more of us monitor the page, hopefully we won't get such a backlog again, or at least (being pedantic) we'll reduce the probability. The challenges, both the people and technical ones, appeal to me, as does the cadre already here, and I've been underusing my admin priviledge recently. So this might work well.

<p>Hi, Andrew. After stumbling on your involvement in the <a href="../../../p/i/p/Talk%7EPipe_organ_refactor_9236.html" title="Talk:Pipe organ/refactor">Pipe Organ Refactor Project</a>... Is there anything on the voicing of pipe organis within Wikipedia? Especially, (1) the problem of balancing the 'voices', and (2) the issue of integrating new voices (or ranks) into existing instruments? I have a particular need to feed such information to an experienced organist who has been asked to advise a church congregation on how to instruct an organ builder / 'voicer' to do the balancing and integration of several new voices into an existing organ. Any other links and advice? Thanks and best wishes, <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Ellis_602e.html" title="User:Peter Ellis">Peter Ellis</a> 01:06, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I gave up long ago trying to understand Hyacinth's thinking. Anyway, although I agree with you, my philosophy of Wikipedia is that it's better to write new articles and improve old ones than waste time in edit wars, so I can't be bothered to deal with Swing rhythm/swung note.

<p>Hi, I've ammended the DFR diagram and the relevant parts of the FBR article as suggested with regard to the coolant. I was also planning on making a schematic of the PFR, which seems to be an order of magnitude more complex, so I've posed some questions on <a href="../../../f/a/s/Talk%7EFast_breeder_reactor_e273.html" title="Talk:Fast breeder reactor">Talk:Fast breeder reactor</a>, I would appreciate any input. <a href="../../../e/m/o/User%7EEmoscopes_e222.html" title="User:Emoscopes">Emoscopes</a> 11:59, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

And you're right, the standards for controversial figures <i>are</i> different than the standards for rocks, hamlets, and shades of purple. I think it's better that we build this article totally rock-solid from the ground up so that the anti-Rick Warren crowd has no real good way to shoe-horn a POV into the article, or to take out good content that's poorly cited.

<dd>The keep result seems appropriate to me. I'm not sure I agree with the speedy close, but I can see why it was done. We have had too many battles in AfD recently in which most of what was said was quite irrelevant to the issue, and was contributed (if that is the word) by people who seemed to have no interest in Wikipedia other than <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">promoting</a> their own <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">point of view</a>.

<dd>Much of what you raise above is completely out of touch with the community values of Wikipedia. Whether Levitt is <i>godless</i> is irrelevant to whether or not he is <i>encyclopedic</i>.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We started a proposal <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiethics_d174.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiethics">Wikipedia:Wikiethics</a> to state the existing policies coherently and make suggestions on improving the editorial standards in Wiki. I thought you might be interested in contributing to that proposal.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a pro-porn and pro-offense lobby is trying to make this proposal a failure. They unilaterally started an approval poll although almost no one including me believe that it is time for a vote, simply because the policy is not ready. It is not even written completely.</p>
<p>Editors who thinks that the policy needs to be improved rather than killed by an unfair poll at the beginning of the proposal, started another poll ('Do we really need a poll at this stage?') at the same time. The poll is vandalized for a while but it is stable now. A NO vote on this ('Do we really need a poll now?') poll will strengthen the position of the editors who are willing to improve the ethics policy further.</p>
<p>If you have concerns about the ethics and editorial standards in Wiki, please visit the page <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiethics_d174.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiethics">Wikipedia:Wikiethics</a> with your suggestions on the policy.

<p>Dear Andrewa, thanks for the note. I was trying to set up my email, but I regret to do that: My account ruined. Now I cannot see the usual configuration of Wiki but something else when I loged in. I do not know if you know anything about how to fix it.</p>
<p>As Netscott rushed to inform you about (its his job here in Wiki to create an unfriendly atmosphere around me) my religious preferences, I am not a Christian activist. I am a regular person believe in the dialogue among the religions in at least moral issues and any others as possible. I emailed those people including you because I thought they may want to know about it, if they are not aware of the issue. Moreover I put a note on the VIllage pump to get more input from the community.</p>
<p>I believe there is a strong danger in Wiki in terms of lower editorial standards and lack of ethics. The philosophy behind Wiki should not be ruined by this. I am trying to propose a policy so that it can be avoided. I would very much like to get possitive and constructive suggestions to improve the proposal. Your contribution so far is very valuabe in my opinion. If we can together go over the policy, discuss the issues in it, add more as necessary and eventually put it into an acceptible form, that would be great.</p>
<p>Thanks for your friendly spirit and suggestions. By the way, any name suggestions for arguments page? -- Resid</p>
<dl>
<dd>My most important suggestion would be to <i>lurk</i> a bit more before plunging into any sort of activism. This is elementary nettiquette.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On Wikipedia, that means more than just reading before you write. It means becoming a <i>contributor</i> before you propose major changes to the infrastructure, which is what a policy proposal is. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 20:07, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you are right in general. I do not want to talk about myself but I am pretty well-experienced on the net and in the real life. So, I thought I can contribute to Wiki using my experience. It might not be the best idea of course. I think it is fair to say that, whether one lurks or not, once it comes to making similar suggestions here, s/he will get the same reaction. There are some people here do not tolerate any ethical considerations. You probably well aware but if you like you can check the policy pages like <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia%7ECensorship_9e44.html" title="Wikipedia:Censorship">Wikipedia:Censorship</a>, or articles like <a href="../../../l/o/l/Lolicon.html" title="Lolicon">Lolicon</a>, etc. Well experienced Wikipedian even having hard time when talking to those people. <a href="../../../r/g/u/User%7ERgulerdem_75f6.html" title="User:Rgulerdem">Resid Gulerdem</a> 00:47, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You know I'm not a big fan of those who speak in falsities...I'm not here to create an unfriendly atmosphere. I got to know Resid early in his Wikipedia editing and took issue with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User%3ARgulerdem" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User%3ARgulerdem" rel="nofollow">his tactics</a> and decided to do something about it. Fortunately Andrewa you've made a very valid point here that <i>lurking</i> is a good idea. Unfortunately <a href="../../../r/g/u/User%7ERgulerdem_75f6.html" title="User:Rgulerdem">User:Rgulerdem</a> didn't seem to get this message like he should have <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Rgulerdem_f141.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Rgulerdem">early on</a>. My council to you Andrewa is to better inform yourself about who Resid is so that you know with whom you'll be helping to develop WikiPedia Policy or Guidelines. If I were a Christian and my faith was deeply a part of my convictions, I'd be inclined to want to know what are the religious convictions (or lack thereof) of those I'd be working with. I am not religious however and I'm respectful of all religions in the <i>general</i> sense (specifics are another question). <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">Netscott</a> 22:10, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your reply and concern. I can see where you're coming from. I didn't intend to claim or assume that Resid is a Christian. It was more that IMO some of the hostility he was encountering was carried over from the <a href="http://cyberchurch.pbwiki.com/the%20Jason%20Gastrich%20disaster" class="external text" title="http://cyberchurch.pbwiki.com/the%20Jason%20Gastrich%20disaster" rel="nofollow">the Jason Gastrich disaster</a> and I thought he should know about that. I also assumed he would not want people to reject Christianity (or anything else) for the wrong reasons. I think that's a reasonable assumption from his user page.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So far as being <i>religious</i> is concerned, if you don't want to call yourself religious I respect that. There is much evil done in the name of religion! There was a period of almost two years in which I quite intentionally did not publicly call myself a Christian, because I was in a society in which that word had associations that I found particularly offensive and which didn't describe my beliefs at all. But as I grew older and perhaps wiser I decided that I wasn't willing to surrender the word <i>Christian</i> so readily to those who have it wrong.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So these days, I use words such as <i>religion</i>, <i>dogma</i> and even <i>Christian</i> in a far more assertive way. For example, in <a href="http://www.zeta.org.au/~andrewa/aja5a2.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.zeta.org.au/~andrewa/aja5a2.htm" rel="nofollow">my old creation science page</a> I asserted: <i>We all need dogma. We all have faith in something.</i> I still stand by that. These are very <i>useful</i> terms. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 00:42, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I want to and probably will try to contribute Wiki in many ways. But on the other hand I think it should worth it. What I exactly mean is this: I do not want to spend my time to contribute an online ensyklopedia that the ethics and editorial standards are not wellcomed. I won't strengthen a structure with my knowledge that a high school student or a college student or a graduate student or anybody else will come to get some information but will be exposed to some nasty pornography as s/he is trying to learn here. Those are very important points for me. This is maybe another reason for getting into some structural suggestions earlier than later. I am respectful to Christianity a great deal and do not mind if you think (or implied) that I am a Christian. I am trying to be a good Muslim -although I am not at that point yet- as Netscott is trying to show you badly for some 'good' reasons and with 'good' intentions. <a href="../../../r/g/u/User%7ERgulerdem_75f6.html" title="User:Rgulerdem">Resid Gulerdem</a> 01:02, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Another possibility is to contribute to the Wikipedia in your native language, if it is not English. I am guessing it might be <a href="http://tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ana_Sayfa" class="external text" title="http://tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ana_Sayfa" rel="nofollow">Turkish</a>, which would be a good project in which to become involved as it's already over 10,000 articles.</dd>

<dd>Or, with your interest in Islam, I expect you read and write <a href="http://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%81%D8%AD%D8%A9_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D8%A6%D9%8A%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A9" class="external text" title="http://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%81%D8%AD%D8%A9_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D8%A6%D9%8A%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A9" rel="nofollow">Arabic</a>. That's another Wikipedia with 10,000+ articles, and would mean your contributions were benefitting the entire Islamic world, rather than being mainly of use in Turkey.</dd>

<dd>There is nothing stopping you from being a contributor to all three (including English), and I'd encourage it. It would be particularly constructive for you to contribute your policy ideas to the other Wikipedias. The policies and procedures of the various Wikipedias tend to be similar, and the ideals are the same, but they are not identical nor are intended to be so, and the matter of censorship and decency is one area in which it is important that they are free to differ. These things are culturally sensitive. What is acceptable and even polite in French for example (the other language in which I am most competent) may be vulgar and offensive when translated into English.</dd>

<dd>But of course, it's essential to become a contributor there with a good record of edits before trying to make major policy changes in <i>any</i> Wikipedia. Otherwise, the likely result is that your ideas won't get a fair hearing. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 03:32, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On November 2004, you edited the bown bear page on wiki, and put up a discussion on tiger vs brown bear on the talk page.
