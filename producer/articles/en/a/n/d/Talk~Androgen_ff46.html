<p>Like taking one cicle of a month? thanks for any info you can give me.</p>
<p>Sorry, an accurate answer will be vague. The long term effects can be enormously different depending on the dose, your age and sex and current androgen effects. For example the effects measurable 5 years after a healthy 20 year old man takes 1 month of a standard adult male replacement dose will be minimal. Effects of that same dose for 3 months in a prepubertal 12 year old might include permanent loss of 2 inches of adult height potential. Effects of that same dose in a 70 year old man with unknown prostate cancer might include growth of the cancer. Wanted and unwanted short and long term effects of all hormones are always dependent on dose, length of treatment, and the hormone status of the person taking them. No exceptions. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 22:14, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The first paragraph says that all androgens are synthesised from androstane. The section on dehydroepiandrosterone says that this one is synthesized from cholesterol in the adrenal cortex. As cholesterol is the original precursor of all steroid hormones, I suppose this latter information can be lifted out. It is confusing rather than informative. / <a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabj_f852.html" title="User:Habj">Habj</a> 19:42, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree these are confusing. I removed the following sentences because they are not true in humans. If they are true in certain animals, we need to specify which and be clearer. It is possible that the androstane claim really means that it is a commonly used precursor for laboratory synthesis, or that it is the fundamental androgen structure, even though it is not an important step in human androgen synthesis, or that it is an important androgen precursor in some species of animal.</p>
<p><i>All natural androgens are steroid derivatives of <a href="../../../a/n/d/Androstane.html" title="Androstane">androstane</a> (19-carbon tetracyclic <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrocarbon.html" title="Hydrocarbon">hydrocarbon</a> nucleus, <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbon.html" title="Carbon">C</a><sub>19</sub><a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrogen.html" title="Hydrogen">H</a><sub>32</sub>).</i></p>

</ul>
<p>· KB2 assay (Vickie S. Wilson; 2002: Toxicological Sciences 66, 69-81) · Describe the effects of androgens in a stably transformed cell line that they developed (MDA-KB2), which expresses the human AR (hAR) and an AR-responsive promoter linked to a luciferase reporter gene (MMTV-luc). · Main advantage of KB2 assay -- it employs a genetically modified cell line, which eliminates the effort and inherent variability associated with repeated transient transfections. · The breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-453, was stably transformed with the MMTV.luciferase.neo reporter gene construct. · Since both GR and AR are present in the MDA-MB-453 cells, and both receptors can act through the MMTV promoter, compounds that act through either AR or GR activate the MMTV luciferase reporter. · AR agonists such as dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and GR agonists such as dexamethasone (DEX), corticosterone, and aldosterone induce luciferase expression at appropriate concentrations.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>· DHT consistently produced 3–9-fold induction at concentrations from 0.1 to 10 nM. · To distinguish AR- from GR-mediated ligands, chemicals were assayed concurrently with the antiandrogen, hydroxyflutamide (OHF), which blocks AR- but not GR-mediated responses. · These cells are relatively easy to culture and maintain. · Responsiveness was monitored over time and was stable for more than 80 passages. · Some advantages -- relatively rapid (2 days), eliminates the need for transfection, can be conducted in a 96-well plate format, produces consistent reproducible results</p>
<ul>
<li>Construction and verification of reporter plasmid containing MMTV. neo.luc-- The neomycin gene was removed from pcDneo and inserted into pMMTV.luc</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Transformation, isolation, and screening of stable clones.</li>
</ul>
<p>MDA-MB-453 cells (ATCC No. HTB 131) used for transformation. Cells were seeded at 2 x 105 cells per 60-mm culture dish in maintenance medium, then transformed using Fugene 6 (Roche) per manufacturer's protocol, with 5 µg pMMTV.luc.neo per dish. To screen clones for responsiveness to an androgen agonist, cells grown from individual colonies were plated at 1 x 104 cells per well in 96-well luminometer plates, allowed to attach. When cells were attached, the medium was replaced with freshly prepared dosing medium containing ethanol only (negative control), an agonist (dihydrotestosterone, DHT; 1 nM), or the agonist plus a known competitor (hydroxyflutamide, OHF; 1 M). Cells were dosed with 100 µl of medium/well and incubated for 20–24 h, --harvested with 25 µl/well of lysis buffer and assayed for luciferase reporter activity.</p>
<pre>
Relative light units per well determined using a 96-well MLX Luminometer.
Clones with a minimum 2-fold response to 1 nM DHT were retained in culture.
The final clone (MDA-kb2) was chosen based on appropriate ligand responsiveness and genetic stability over time.

<li>Maintenance of cultures and transcriptional activation assays.</li>

-MDA-kb2 cells stably transformed with the pMMTV.neo.luc reporter gene construct were maintained in L-15 media supplemented with, 100
U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 µg/ml amphotericin B at 37°C, without CO2.
-For experiments, cells were plated at 1 x 104 cells per well in 100 µl of medium in 96-well luminometer plates.
</pre>
<p>-When cells were attached (4–6 h), medium was removed and replaced with dosing medium. Stock solutions for each chemical were prepared at 1000x in ethanol. - Dosing medium was prepared at the time of treatment by aliquoting 1 µl of stock solution into 1 ml of maintenance medium -Vehicle control wells contained 100 µl medium/ well with1 µl of ethanol/ml of medium. Each plate also contained either 0.1 or 1.0 nM DHT, or DHT/plus 1 µM OHF as agonist control. -Cells were incubated overnight at 37°C without CO2.</p>
<pre>
Luciferase activity was assayed --using an MLX microtiter plate luminometer and quantified as relative light units (RLU).
</pre>
<p>-Relative light units were converted to fold induction above the vehicle control value for each replicate for statistical analysis. -Stability of Androgenic Response and Baseline Activity Androgen-induced luciferase activity measured over approximately 9 months of continuous culture to assess the stability and responsiveness of the MDA-kb2 clone.</p>
<p>-cells were assayed over more than 80 passages for their response to 1 nM DHT.</p>
<p>-At early passages, luciferase induction relative to solvent controls was about 10 fold.</p>
<p>-In continuous culture, luciferase induction dropped over time, but responsiveness stabilized at 30 to 40 passages.</p>
<p>-In later passages, a minimum of 5–6-fold induction in response to 1 nM DHT was consistently maintained over the remaining test period for more than 80 passages, demonstrating stable expression of the luciferase gene. P. C. Hartig,1, Toxicological Sciences 66, 82-90 (2002)</p>
