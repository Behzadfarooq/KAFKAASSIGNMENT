He was in numerous productions during high school, was well known as the class clown, and was elected homecoming king his senior year in the fall of 1983. Even in high school, Dick tended to use his name as a joke. One day while dressed in the Joliet West gold athletic sweats he pulled on a pair of red shorts over his sweats and used a red towel as a cape matching his shorts. He presented himself at school as "Super Dick." He's good friends with theatre personality <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Rapp_3e46.html" title="Anthony Rapp">Anthony Rapp</a>, who has known him since they were children.</p>
<p>During his high school years, he ran for a student office position against one of the school's more popular athletes. For his campaign ads, he chose to heavily advertise the slogan "Don't vote for a jock, vote for A. Dick!" Because it was his name, the school administration failed to stop him from using this slogan; he won the election.</p>
<p>He attended <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_College_Chicago_228d.html" title="Columbia College Chicago">Columbia College Chicago</a> and is registered as one of the school's "distinguished alumni". According to faculty member David Wooley, during his final for Stage Combat his partner did not show up and, faced with a failing grade, Andy decided to fight himself, earning him an A for the final.</p>
