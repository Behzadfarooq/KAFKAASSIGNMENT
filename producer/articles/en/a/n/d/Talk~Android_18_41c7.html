<p>Juuhachigou and Juunanagou are not machines. A better name would be Cyborg's 17/18.</p>
<p><br />
Juunana-gou and Juuhachi-gou are artificially enhanced humans. Juuhachi-gou is the older of the twins, but Juunana-gou is more powerfull.</p>
<p>Cyborg is a more appropiate term. Android is a robot that looks like a human, so it doesn't make sense to name her that.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Erm, but Android 17 and 18 are their official names in the television show <a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclone49_674c.html" title="User:Cyclone49">Cyclone49</a> 12:11, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>They are both the same power for your information.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Android 17 and Android 18 are the official ENGLISH names. However, Trunks explains that a better term to call them by is cyborgs after calling them Artificial Humans in the original. Jinzoningen, or rather Artificial Human, is the actual official ORIGINAL name. And #17 is stronger than #18, though weaker than #16.
<dl>
<dd>I dunno if this has any bearing whatsoever, but in the (older)Japanese games, 18's always been labelled as "№ 18". I know "Juuhachi" is literally just "18" in Japanese and "-gou" is "(1) number; issue" or "(2) sobriquet; pen-name;"... So here's a question. ...why not just name them all "Number" or "№" and be done with it? The rest of the entries seem to coinside with the transliterations of names.(Freeza, Cooler, Tao Pai Pai, Muten Roshi, etc.) ~ <font color="#00BF00">Joseph Collins</font> (<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoseph_Collins_3462.html" title="User:Joseph Collins">U</a>)(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJoseph_Collins_c48e.html" title="User talk:Joseph Collins">T</a>)(<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Joseph_Collins_ea35.html" title="Special:Contributions/Joseph Collins">C</a>) 05:23, 31 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Fun fact: The Japanese actually label them in English as "Android Number ##" when writing them out long-ways. So "Android ##" is technically perfectly correct!

<p><b>From the Android 17 article:</b> Android 17 is actually not a robot. He is an essentially a regular human with "upgrades" (I.E., Cyborg) along with his twin sister, Android 18. The two were experimented by Dr. Gero though very little of their history is given.</p>
<p><b>From this article</b> She is referred to in the original Japanese as an artificial human, which is translated as 'android' in the literal sense; she is not a robot, and it is implied in the manga she and her brother were originally runaways heavily fitted with cybernetics.</p>
<p>So this article says that the Androids are "Artificial humans", when the other says that they were both human. Should one of these be modified?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Both basically say that they are cybrogs, which is essentially what they are. The Japanese term Jinzoningen covers that definition of the characters, as well as describing true androids like 16 or 19, and even covers cell (since he was artificially created despite being mostly biological). In english we don't have a wide term to cover all of those, so for simplicity sake the dub just went with Android. <a href="../../../o/n/i/User%7EOnikage725_5479.html" title="User:Onikage725">Onikage725</a> 22:41, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why can't attacks from video games be listed??? this is an information source, the more information the better! You had no right ot delete those moves and i will put them back up when I have the time.</p>
<dl>
<dd>yes but this is not a FAQ and you really should sign your comments with the three (or four) ~'s</dd>

<p><a href="../../../d/b/z/User%7EDBZROCKS_09a8.html" title="User:DBZROCKS">DBZROCKS</a> 21:59, 26 February 2007 (UTC) Erh I don't think listing attacks from video games make it an FAQ, what the hell are you on? three's and four's? I don't care for that.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Instead of deleting them, seperate them into sections. One for attacks seen in the anime/manga, the other from videogames. Both are appropriate as long as they are verifiable. Malamockq 17:36, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"As a cyborg, Android-18 is extremely powerful, she is able to easily overpower a basic Super-Saiyan. This is first demonstrated to when she fights Super-Saiyan Vegeta, she is able to severely injure him and walk away completely unscathed save her clothes. 18 along with 17 and 16 is fitted with a infinite energy device. This makes it so that she never tires. She is at least capable of handling a regular super saiyan though her power pales in comparison to further SSJ levels. She has also been noted to be less powerful than her brother 17."</p>
<p><br />
Too much original research to be left in the article, also many of the statements aren't true. Saying 18 can defeat a super saiyan isn't acurate since different saiyan's SS1 level can differ from others, and their own can change as the series progresses (for example, Goku's SS1 level when fighting Freeza is weaker than Goku's SS1 level when he sparred Trunks).</p>
<p>I rewrote it, but DBZROCKS wasn't satisfied with it. I'll reinstate the section when it is properly rewritten. Malamockq 17:39, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Here's my rewrite if anyone is interested.</p>
<p>"As a cyborg, Android-18 is extremely powerful, she was able to easily overpower Vegeta in his basic Super-Saiyan form. This is first demonstrated during the Cell saga when she was able to severely injure him and walk away completely unscathed save her clothes. 18 along with 17 and 16 is fitted with a infinite energy device. This makes it so that she never tires.</p>
<p>During the Buu saga, she fights Goten and Trunks in both of their normal forms during a tournament, to a stand still, herself noting a significant difficulty in fighting the boys unlike her previous fight against Vegeta. During this time, Goten and Trunks are both disguised, and posing as an adult because tournament rules do not allow them to fight adults. After Goten and Trunks power up to their Super Saiyan forms she took note of their extremely powerful energy blast and sought to reveal their true identity before they got the upperhand. After revealing them, the referee disqualified from the boys from the tournament."</p>
<p>I didn't think there was any fandom in it. Everything is verifiable, and taken from the anime/manga, but feel free to discuss. Malamockq 17:42, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dude were you just talking to yourself? Anyway remember to add&#160;:'s to every paragraph. <a href="../../../d/b/z/User%7EDBZROCKS_09a8.html" title="User:DBZROCKS">DBZROCKS</a> 00:20, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You only add&#160;: when you are replying to someone's post, I was merely adding on to my original point. I removed the Power section again because if I only removed the parts that are Original Research the section won't make any sense. It requires a complete rewrite. You may attempt to rewrite the section if you wish, but don't revert back to the old version. Malamockq 17:53, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
