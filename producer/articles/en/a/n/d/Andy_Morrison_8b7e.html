<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Morrison_8b7e.html" title="Edit section: Early career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early career</span></h2>
<p>Morrison began his career at <a href="../../../p/l/y/Plymouth_Argyle_F.C._5ab7.html" title="Plymouth Argyle F.C.">Plymouth Argyle</a> and became a firm favourite at the club. In 1995 he transferred to <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackburn_Rovers_F.C._07df.html" title="Blackburn Rovers F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a>, then managed by compatriot <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenny_Dalglish_15cd.html" title="Kenny Dalglish">Kenny Dalglish</a>, but was unable to break into the team (which was at that time challenging to become <a href="../../../f/a/_/FA_Premier_League_68f5.html" title="FA Premier League">Premier League</a> champions) and was sold to fellow Lancastrians <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackpool_F.C._11b5.html" title="Blackpool F.C.">Blackpool</a>.</p>
<p>After two years each with Blackpool and <a href="../../../h/u/d/Huddersfield_Town_F.C._a572.html" title="Huddersfield Town F.C.">Huddersfield Town</a>, Morrison became a <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester_City_F.C._90bc.html" title="Manchester City F.C.">Manchester City</a> player in 1999 and was an instant favourite with the fans, who nicknamed him 'Mozza'. After becoming captain, he led City to victory over <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gillingham_F.C._14c8.html" title="Gillingham F.C.">Gillingham</a> in the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_League_Second_Division_82be.html" title="Football League Second Division">Division Two</a> play-off final at <a href="../../../w/e/m/Wembley_Stadium_7314.html" title="Wembley Stadium">Wembley</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Morrison_8b7e.html" title="Edit section: Injury woes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Injury woes</span></h2>
<p>In the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_League_First_Division_6af3.html" title="Football League First Division">Division One</a>, Morrison was famously sent off for sticking out his tongue at <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stan_Collymore_39a0.html" title="Stan Collymore">Stan Collymore</a> in a draw with <a href="../../../f/u/l/Fulham_F.C._53e7.html" title="Fulham F.C.">Fulham</a>. His performances endeared him to then <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland_national_football_team.html" title="Scotland national football team">Scotland</a> manager <a href="../../../c/r/a/Craig_Brown_%28footballer%29_2f7d.html" title="Craig Brown (footballer)">Craig Brown</a> and there was talk of his being called up to the international team to play in a crucial <a href="../../../e/u/r/Euro_2000.html" title="Euro 2000">Euro 2000</a> qualifying match against <a href="../../../e/n/g/England_national_football_team.html" title="England national football team">England</a>. However, twelve games into the season, Morrison picked up an injury which meant he would miss the rest of the season, which ultimately saw City promoted to the Premiership. He spent fourteen months attempting to return to the Manchester City team, even requesting that then-City manager <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Royle_bbba.html" title="Joe Royle">Joe Royle</a> loan him out to his former team Blackpool and also to <a href="../../../c/r/y/Crystal_Palace_F.C._accb.html" title="Crystal Palace F.C.">Crystal Palace</a> to improve his match fitness. His absence had prompted Royle to sign <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spencer_Prior_a518.html" title="Spencer Prior">Spencer Prior</a> to help the team earn promotion, and subsequently <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Howey_bec8.html" title="Steve Howey">Steve Howey</a> and <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Dunne_25e2.html" title="Richard Dunne">Richard Dunne</a> to help the team stay in the top flight.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Morrison_8b7e.html" title="Edit section: Return to action">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Return to action</span></h2>
<p>Morrison returned in a <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_League_Cup_66aa.html" title="Football League Cup">League Cup</a> game against <a href="../../../i/p/s/Ipswich_Town_F.C._bb93.html" title="Ipswich Town F.C.">Ipswich</a> in December 2000 in which he was man of the match. However, due to the number of yellow cards he had picked up in reserve-team games he could not play Premiership football until <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Year%27s_Day_a3c7.html" title="New Year's Day">New Year's Day</a> 2001, when he was man of the match in a 1-1 draw with <a href="../../../c/o/v/Coventry_City_F.C._d635.html" title="Coventry City F.C.">Coventry</a>. In his next outing, an <a href="../../../f/a/_/FA_Cup_f364.html" title="FA Cup">FA Cup</a> game against <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham_City_F.C._f327.html" title="Birmingham City F.C.">Birmingham</a>, he scored with a bullet header in a 3-1 victory.</p>
<p>In another FA Cup game, against <a href="../../../l/i/v/Liverpool_F.C._2b1a.html" title="Liverpool F.C.">Liverpool</a>, Morrison was cautioned by a police officer after squirting the Liverpool fans when he had been substituted. He only played a few more games for City before being loaned out to <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheffield_United_F.C._8e73.html" title="Sheffield United F.C.">Sheffield United</a>, where he picked up the injury that ended his career. Morrison had been loaned out to try and improve his fitness. City were subsequently relegated to Division One once more and <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Keegan_512a.html" title="Kevin Keegan">Kevin Keegan</a> became manager at <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maine_Road_b545.html" title="Maine Road">Maine Road</a>. Keegan brought in players such as <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stuart_Pearce_4ab3.html" title="Stuart Pearce">Stuart Pearce</a> and <a href="../../../e/y/a/Eyal_Berkovic_e9f7.html" title="Eyal Berkovic">Eyal Berkovic</a>, and it was speculated that Morrison's time at the club was over. Nevertheless, Keegan praised the Scot for his hard work in training, and with City's defence leaking goals many hoped Morrison would be given his chance; however, he failed to recover from the injury he sustained while he was at Sheffield United and he was released at the end of the season. This was not before he was given his chance to say farewell to the Manchester City fans in a match against <a href="../../../c/r/y/Crystal_Palace_F.C._accb.html" title="Crystal Palace F.C.">Crystal Palace</a>. Keegan said of Morrison: "Andy received cult status when the club gained promotion. He is a first-class professional and deserves a chance to further his career."</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Morrison_8b7e.html" title="Edit section: Later career and retirement">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Later career and retirement</span></h2>
<p>In late 2002, Morrison was given a trial at <a href="../../../b/u/r/Bury_F.C._b423.html" title="Bury F.C.">Bury</a>. He played 45 minutes for Bury's reserve team, but his injury prevented him taking any further part. A few months later he decided to retire from football altogether. He is currently assistant manager to <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Preece_3563.html" title="Andy Preece">Andy Preece</a> at <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worcester_City_F.C._39c9.html" title="Worcester City F.C.">Worcester City</a>. He is remembered by Manchester City fans as one of their best-ever captains, and was voted so in the club's official magazine. Only <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_Paul_3c78.html" title="Roy Paul">Roy Paul</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Book_8b63.html" title="Tony Book">Tony Book</a> were deemed to be better captains than him. The magazine also listed Morrison second in a list of hard men, behind <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Doyle_%28footballer%29_0d86.html" title="Mike Doyle (footballer)">Mike Doyle</a> but above the likes of Stuart Pearce and <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerry_Gow_0d43.html" title="Gerry Gow">Gerry Gow</a>. Many feel that it was Morrison's leadership skills and ability to get the players around him to raise their game that enabled Manchester City to return to the Premiership after their fall into Division Two. In an interview with the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> on the <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_23.html" title="September 23">September 23</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, Joe Royle spoke of his sympathy for <a href="../../../n/o/t/Nottingham_Forest_F.C._cb2c.html" title="Nottingham Forest F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a>, a team which, like Manchester City, had fallen two divisions. He said, "Big clubs in that division are a scalp and everyone wants to beat them. We had that at City and it was hard for us, but we got the hang of it. The catalyst for us was signing Andy Morrison. He was the man for the job and the man for the division. He dragged us up kicking and screaming. He is the kind of player that Forest need - if they can find somebody like him. We only got him because of his injury record, and because he had had a major fall-out with the manager at Huddersfield. He was as strong as they come and feared nobody - he played a big part in turning things round for us."</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Morrison_8b7e.html" title="Edit section: Post-retirement">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Post-retirement</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_2006.html" title="August 2006">August 2006</a>, Morrison pleaded guilty to four charges of fraud concerning income support, jobseeker's allowance, and council tax benefits, dating from <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_2003.html" title="August 2003">August 2003</a> to <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_2005.html" title="July 2005">July 2005</a>. He failed to inform the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_for_Work_and_Pensions_2db2.html" title="Department for Work and Pensions">Department for Work and Pensions</a> and <a href="../../../v/a/l/Vale_Royal_d5a6.html" title="Vale Royal">Vale Royal</a> Borough Council in Cheshire that he had £58,000 in his bank account while he was still claiming benefits. He defrauded the authorities out of more than £6,500 and was ordered to pay £95 court costs and carry out a fifty-hour community punishment order. In mitigation it was said that he "was dissipating the capital very quickly, spending his own money on operations. He blames no-one apart from himself. He is not financially-astute at all. He is very naive when it comes to finance. He has little or no knowledge of the financial world".</p>
<p>During a pre-season friendly match against <a href="../../../k/i/d/Kidderminster_Harriers_F.C._13d6.html" title="Kidderminster Harriers F.C.">Kidderminster Harriers</a> on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_5.html" title="August 5">August 5</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, an incident in the changing-room area caused the game to be abandoned after 71 minutes. Harriers' manager Mark Yates called the referee over to him and said he was going to take his team off due to an off-the-field incident involving Morrison. On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_17.html" title="August 17">August 17</a>, Worcester City announced the results of an internal enquiry in the incident. The club fined Morrison the maximum allowed under <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Football_Association_b0ba.html" title="The Football Association">FA</a> guidelines, suspended him for three games, and warned him of his future conduct. The Football Association itself fined Morrison £750 and also gave him a six-match touchline ban.</p>
