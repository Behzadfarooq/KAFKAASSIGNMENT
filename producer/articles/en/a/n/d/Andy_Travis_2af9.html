Bailey Quarters (Jan Smithers) and Andy Travis (Gary Sandy)</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Andy Travis</b> is a fictional character on the television <a href="../../../s/i/t/Situation_comedy.html" title="Situation comedy">situation comedy</a> <i><a href="../../../w/k/r/WKRP_in_Cincinnati_4956.html" title="WKRP in Cincinnati">WKRP in Cincinnati</a></i> (1978-82). He was played by <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Sandy_ec58.html" title="Gary Sandy">Gary Sandy</a>.</p>
<p>Andy was originally intended to be the lead character on <i>WKRP</i>, the more-or-less normal person who would anchor the series and provide the focus for most of the stories. This followed the formula of other shows from <i>WKRP'</i>s production company, <a href="../../../m/t/m/MTM_Enterprises_74da.html" title="MTM Enterprises">MTM Enterprises</a>, like <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Richards_9d6c.html" title="Mary Richards">Mary Richards</a> on <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Mary_Tyler_Moore_Show_478f.html" title="The Mary Tyler Moore Show">The Mary Tyler Moore Show</a></i> or Dr. Bob Hartley on <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bob_Newhart_Show_ffab.html" title="The Bob Newhart Show">The Bob Newhart Show</a></i>. One critic even described Andy as "Gary Tyler Moore." However, as the first season went on, it soon became apparent that Andy didn't have what it took to carry the show, and that other characters were eclipsing him in popularity. Because of that, <i>WKRP</i> shifted to being more of a straightforward ensemble comedy, where there was no clear lead character and any one of the eight regulars could carry an episode. But Andy remained an important character on the series, and Gary Sandy retained top billing for all four seasons of the show.</p>
<p><a name="Program_director" id="Program_director"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Travis_2af9.html" title="Edit section: Program director">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Program director</span></h2>
<p>In the pilot episode of <i>WKRP</i>, Andy arrives in <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cincinnati.html" title="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a> to take over as program director of WKRP. He explains that he was previously working as program director of a radio station in his native city of <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Fe%2C_New_Mexico_6a40.html" title="Santa Fe, New Mexico">Santa Fe, New Mexico</a>; it is revealed in a later episode that he ran a station in <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albuquerque.html" title="Albuquerque">Albuquerque</a>. He is young, handsome and friendly, and though he is viewed with suspicion by the old guard at the low-rated station -- like station manager <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Carlson_788a.html" title="Arthur Carlson">Arthur Carlson</a>, sales director <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herb_Tarlek_03bc.html" title="Herb Tarlek">Herb Tarlek</a>, and news director <a href="../../../l/e/s/Les_Nessman_6662.html" title="Les Nessman">Les Nessman</a> -- he soon manages to win them over to his side. Mr. Carlson even defends Andy to his domineering mother, the station's owner, when she wants to fire Andy.</p>
<p>Described by Mr. Carlson as a "cowboy," Andy frequently wears boots and a cowboy hat. He also wears very tight jeans to work, which makes Mr. Carlson uncomfortable. "With denim," Andy explains, "I feel comfortable and relaxed. I feel as though I can work better." He wears his hair in the late '70s "feathered" style, and many of the characters make fun of his ample hair: <a href="../../../b/a/i/Bailey_Quarters_8810.html" title="Bailey Quarters">Bailey Quarters</a>, asking him to take part in a promotion, asks him to imagine "Your hair flowing in the wind -- now, that stuff will flow!" Though he is usually quiet and low-key, describing himself as "an easy-going guy with a natural ability to lead," he can sometimes lose his temper when his employees won't listen to him, which is more often than not. In response to <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Fever_26b6.html" title="Johnny Fever">Johnny Fever</a>'s refusal to play his playlist of top 40 hits, Andy jokingly threatened to shoot himself.</p>
<p>Andy's first act as program director of WKRP is to change the format from "beautiful music" to top 40 rock n' roll. He has, in his own words, "lived and breathed radio ever since I was a little boy," and his ambition is to turn WKRP around and make it a top-rated station. But after changing the format, he finds himself unable to do what it really takes to improve the station: fire the incompetent employees, Herb and Les. He has come to feel affection for them, and he also knows that if he ever started cleaning house, he would have to ask Mama Carlson to fire the most incompetent employee of all: Mr. Carlson. He also can't convince Johnny to play the disco songs that were popular in the late '70s.</p>
<p>After his first year on the job, when WKRP only rises two spots to 14th in the 18 station market, Andy realizes that he has failed by being too lenient. After a conversation with his friend, nighttime <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disc_jockey.html" title="Disc jockey">disc jockey</a> Gordon "<a href="../../../v/e/n/Venus_Flytrap_%28WKRP_in_Cincinnati%29_9883.html" title="Venus Flytrap (WKRP in Cincinnati)">Venus Flytrap</a>" Sims, Andy realizes that he can't leave WKRP: he likes the people too much, and the quirky station has a family atmosphere that wasn't there at any other station he worked for. Andy decides to abandon his dream of becoming a hugely successful program director in exchange for the fun of working for WKRP; or as Venus puts it, "you gave up a chance to be boy wonder of American radio to be the head guard of a nut farm."</p>
<p>As the series goes on, Andy turns his attention to fighting against the increasingly bland, corporate world of modern radio, trying to preserve the quirkiness and uniqueness that drew him to WKRP in the first place. In one episode, he meets Norris Breeze, a former employee from New Mexico who is now a successful programming consultant. Breeze is appalled by Andy's decision to let the DJs pick the music they like instead of just playing the same songs over and over, like most radio stations. "Nobody is programming their own music," Breeze says. "We are, and that's the way it's going to stay," Andy replies.</p>
<p>A story arc from the final season of <i>WKRP</i> has Andy working behind the scenes to get Mama Carlson to put more money into the station, so that he can improve the place and give the employees raises. When the employees consider unionizing, he strikes a deal with her: he will keep the union out of the station if she will pay higher salaries and allow him to renovate the station's lobby. The others never find out what Andy did, and it is part of the strong characterization of <i>WKRP</i> that it would allow a likable character to do something so ethically dubious.</p>
<p>Also in the final season, Andy takes Mama Carlson out to dinner and the opera, hoping to get her to invest still more money (this time to buy a new transmitter). He begins to wonder if she expects him to sleep with her in exchange for the money. In the end, it turns out that she only wanted to go out with a personable young man on her arm, though she happily torments him by allowing him to believe that she has greater expectations. She points out to her son that she and Andy are mutually using each other: he's dating her to get money, she's using his companionship to build up her social profile.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Travis_2af9.html" title="Edit section: Personal life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Personal life</span></h2>
<p>Although never seen pursuing either of WKRP's female staffers (<a href="../../../j/e/n/Jennifer_Marlowe_47eb.html" title="Jennifer Marlowe">Jennifer Marlowe</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/i/Bailey_Quarters_8810.html" title="Bailey Quarters">Bailey Quarters</a>), Andy is not immune to their charms. He occasionally engages in harmless banter with Jennifer from time to time. His romantic interplay with Bailey is limited to a moment in the episode "Dear Liar", which gives a hint of a mutual attraction; when he reprimands Bailey for writing a false news story (that <a href="../../../l/e/s/Les_Nessman_6662.html" title="Les Nessman">Les Nessman</a> subsequently plagarizes and reads on-air), Andy informs her that if she ever did anything like that again, she would be "the best-looking woman on the unemployment line". Bailey's response is non-verbal, but obviously quite pleased.</p>
<p>In the episode "Love Returns", an old flame shows up. Now a very successful <a href="../../../c/o/u/Country_and_western.html" title="Country and western">country and western</a> singer, she offers him a job. Though very tempted, he decides to stay at WKRP.</p>
