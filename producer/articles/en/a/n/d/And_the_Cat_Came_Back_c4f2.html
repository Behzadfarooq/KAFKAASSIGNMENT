	    <p><b>"And the cat came back"</b> (also known as <b>"The cat came back"</b>) is a popular children's song, written by Harry S. Miller, in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1893.html" title="1893">1893</a>. The story is a comedy, telling a silly tale about a man who had a <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cat.html" title="Cat">cat</a> that he didn't want, and when he tried to get rid of the cat, the cat kept coming back. It was also used as the basis for the 1988 short animated film <i>The Cat Came Back</i> by Cordell Barker.</p>

<p>The song is often used to teach children the concepts of <a href="../../../r/h/y/Rhythm.html" title="Rhythm">rhythm</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/m/Tempo.html" title="Tempo">tempo</a>. It is an excellent example in this regard, because of the strong and consistent <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beat_%28music%29.html" title="Beat (music)">beat</a> pattern, combined with amusing and humorous lyrics. Additionally, especially the minor key versions of the song, have a compelling effect with regards to perception of tempo.</p>
<p>Like many children's songs, the song has a very strong well-defined beat pattern. It consists of one weak beat, one strong beat, so it is often sung in 2/ time (e.g. 2/4 time if the reference duration for one beat is set to a 1/4 note).</p>
<p>Thus it can be (and often is) sung while walking, with, for example, strong beats when the left foot hits the ground and weak beats when the right foot hits the ground.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/And_the_Cat_Came_Back_c4f2.html" title="Edit section: Versions of the song">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Versions of the song</span></h2>
<p>There are many versions of the song. In one, the cat is yellow. One version goes something like:</p>
<p>first verse:</p>
<pre>
now OLD mr. JOHNson had some TROUBLES of his OWN,
he HAD a scarlet CAT that just WOULDN'T leave his HOME,
he TRIED and he TRIED to GIVE the cat AWAY,
he GAVE it to a MAN going FAR far AWAY.
</pre>
<p>chorus:</p>
<pre>
but the CAT came BACK the VERY next DAY,
the CAT came BACK, we THOUGHT he was a GONER,
the CAT came BACK, he JUST wouldn't STAY aWAY.
</pre>
<p>Alternate Chorus:</p>
<pre>
but the CAT came BACK he wouldnt stay away,
he was sitting on the porch the very next day.
</pre>
<p><br />
Every second beat is emphasized (emphasized beats are shown in capitalized lyrics).</p>
<p>Each line of text in the above has eight beats, and usually the chords fall (piano) or begin (organ) on the capitalized words.</p>
<p>The chord progression repeats every 8 beats, so one might think of the song as being in either 2/ time or 8/ time (whichever denominator you use for reference time, i.e. 2/4 or 8/4 time if the beat is a quarter note, etc.). The pattern of 2/ and 8/ is very similar to the beat pattern in <a href="../../../t/w/i/Twinkle_Twinkle_Little_Star_1c72.html" title="Twinkle Twinkle Little Star">Twinkle Twinkle Little Star</a>, but phase-shifted by 180 degrees (since the song starts on a weak beat rather than the strong beat beginning of Twinkle Twinkle).</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/And_the_Cat_Came_Back_c4f2.html" title="Edit section: Medleys">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Medleys</span></h3>
<p>The song helped launch the career of children's entertainer <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Penner_c8ee.html" title="Fred Penner">Fred Penner</a>. He has used the song as part of a medley that includes the tune heard in (<a href="../../../h/i/t/Hit_the_Road_Jack_e546.html" title="Hit the Road Jack">Hit the Road Jack</a>) with lyrics changed to "Hit the Road Cat".</p>
<p><a name="Zero_padding_or_improv.2Finstrumental_of_the_chorus" id="Zero_padding_or_improv.2Finstrumental_of_the_chorus"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/And_the_Cat_Came_Back_c4f2.html" title="Edit section: Zero padding or improv/instrumental of the chorus">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Zero padding or improv/instrumental of the chorus</span></h3>
<p>As with many simple children's songs, it is often desired to have the number of beats be a <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_of_two.html" title="Power of two">power of two</a>, so the first verse plus the chorus takes up, for example, 64 beats, so it is often nice to put some kind of instrumental or improvized section at the end of the chorus to make it fit nicely into 64 rather than 56 beats for one verse plus one run of the chorus. Alternatively an 8-beat rest (zero padding) may be inserted and the end of the chorus.</p>
<p>Many versions are in a major key, but there are some versions that are also in a minor key. The chord progression for many of the minor-key versions is Am, G, F, E.</p>

<p>Children often make up their own verses, but some include:</p>
<pre>
The man around the corner said he'd shoot the cat on sight,
he loaded up his shotgun with nails and dynamite,
he waited and he waited for the cat to come around,
but 97 pieces of the man is all they found.
</pre>
<p>Chorus</p>
<pre>
He gave it to a man going up in a balloon,
he said for to give it to the man in the moon,
the balloon came down about 90 miles away,
where the man is now, I dare not say.
</pre>
<p>Chorus</p>
<pre>
He gave it to a man going way out west,
he said for to give it to the one he loved best,
'course the train hit the tracks and went off the rails,
how he got away was an amazing tale.
</pre>
<p>Chorus</p>
<pre>
But the cat came back, he didn't stay away
He was sitting on the porch the very next day.
The cat came back, he did not want to roam.
The very next day it was home sweet home.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/And_the_Cat_Came_Back_c4f2.html" title="Edit section: Variations in the melody of the additional verses">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Variations in the melody of the additional verses</span></h2>
<p>The additional verses often have a notable variation in melody but with the same chords. For example the second verse often shoots up an octave to emphasize the words "dynamite" and "found" (each sung an octave above the first note of the song, which is "E" if the song is sung in the key of A-minor), even though the first verse does not shoot up that way.</p>
<p>The third verse often contains a descending scale that does not appear in the first or second verses.</p>
<p><a name="Microtonal_and_chirp-based_versions_of_the_chorus" id="Microtonal_and_chirp-based_versions_of_the_chorus"></a></p>

<p>Also, the second line of the chorus "thought he was a goner" is often sung either <a href="../../../o/f/f/Off-key.html" title="Off-key">off-key</a> (deliberately), or just said (not sung), or includes chirps or quarter tones (notes that fall between semitones). In some versions the chirps can be approximated by a chromatic glissando.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/And_the_Cat_Came_Back_c4f2.html" title="Edit section: Bass line">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bass line</span></h2>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/And_the_Cat_Came_Back_c4f2.html" title="Edit section: Harmonic minor variations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Harmonic minor variations</span></h3>
<p>The chord progression lends itself exceptionally well to a bass line that's natural minor descending, and harmonic minor ascending, i.e. in the key of A-minor, the 8 beats (in 8/ time) would play out as A, A, G, G, F, F, E, G#</p>
<p><a name="Melodic_minor_variations" id="Melodic_minor_variations"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/And_the_Cat_Came_Back_c4f2.html" title="Edit section: Melodic minor variations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Melodic minor variations</span></h3>
<p>Additionally, the bass line may be played as melodic minor (i.e. including both an F# and a G# on the way up). This second variation is very effective in teaching children the concept of a melodic minor scale, since melodic minor otherwise occurs so seldom in simple children's songs.</p>

<p>Further additional lyrics are listed on various websites devoted to children's songs, such as: <a href="http://www.kididdles.com/mouseum/c020.html" class="external free" title="http://www.kididdles.com/mouseum/c020.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kididdles.com/mouseum/c020.html</a></p>
<pre>
He gave it to a man going way out West,
Told him for to take it to the one he loved the best;
First the train hit the curve, then it jumped the rail,
Not a soul was left behind to tell the gruesome tale.
</pre>
<p>Chorus</p>
<pre>
Away across the ocean they did send the cat at last,
Vessel only out a day and making water fast;
People all began to pray, the boat began to toss,
A great big gust of wind came by and every soul was lost.
</pre>
<p>Chorus</p>
<pre>
The cat was a possessor of a family of its own,
With seven little kittens till there came a cyclone;
Blew the houses all apart and tossed the cat around,
The air was full of kittens, and not a one was ever found.
</pre>
<p>Chorus</p>
<pre>
The atom bomb fell just the other day,
The H-Bomb fell in the very same way;
Russia went, England went, and then the U.S.A.
The human race was finished without a chance to pray.
</pre>
<p>Chorus</p>
