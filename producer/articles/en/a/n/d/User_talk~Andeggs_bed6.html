<p>In <a href="../../../e/p/o/Template%7EEpochs_of_Roman_Emperors_b871.html" title="Template:Epochs of Roman Emperors">Template:Epochs of Roman Emperors</a>, you changed "Julio-Claudian dynasty" to "Julio-Claudian_dynasty", "Year of the four emperors" to "Year_of_the_Four_Emperors", and others, why?--<a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPanairjdde_99b7.html" title="User:Panairjdde">Panairjdde</a> 15:17, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was trying to make those links go bold when one is viewing on it on that page. The reason they weren't was because "emperors" needs a capital 'E' to go the real article (rather than a redirect page). The underscore is irrelevant. Hope that makes sense <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndeggs_3821.html" title="User:Andeggs">Andeggs</a> 15:52, 7 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, no problem. I just wondered why.</dd>
<dd>I would like to know your opinion on one thing. The current version of the table reads "Dominate: Constantine Dynasty | Valentinian Dynasty". My impression would be that the Dominate is actually divided into Constantiniana and Valentinian dynasties. Would it be better to write something like "Dominate (Constantinian and Valentinian dinasties)"? Best regards. --<a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPanairjdde_99b7.html" title="User:Panairjdde">Panairjdde</a> 18:44, 7 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Panairjdde, I know next to nothing about this subject so am probably not the best person to ask! I was just fixing the template - that's how I got involved. In my humble opinion, they should not be in brackets because it seems from the articles that the Dynasties were consecutive rather than concurrent. I may well be wrong though - so go ahead and change if you think best. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndeggs_3821.html" title="User:Andeggs">Andeggs</a> 07:54, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Re. {{<a href="../../../e/p/o/Template%7EEpochs_of_Roman_Emperors_b871.html" title="Template:Epochs of Roman Emperors">Epochs of Roman Emperors</a>}}: I removed some of the new editing for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Roman emperors after Antiquity had been cut out, e.g. "Holy Roman Emperors" have <b>Roman Emperors</b> in their name, + an adjective <i>Holy</i> → if one wants to have a navigational template that covers <i>all</i> Epochs of Roman Emperors, they have to be there somewhere. As there's no continuity of these <i>Roman Emperors</i> with those of Antiquity, I sought for a layout that put them somewhere out of the <i>usual</i> frame. Similarly for Byzantian Emperors after the final schism of the "Eastern" and the "Western" Roman Empire: the material link of the Byzantine Emperors with the City of <b>Rome</b> was from that moment reduced to zero, so, graphically out of the usual "frame" of the Roman emperors of Antiquity.</li>
<li>Many other details, e.g. "5 good emperors" is not *completely* synonymous with the Nervan-Antonian dynasty (that had <i>more</i> than 5 emperors, <i>horizontal lines</i> in the columns could indicate simultaneous developments in physically separated realms, etc...</li>
<li>Technical issues (minor, but still...), e.g.: the "align=right" instruction gave messy layout when the template was ranged in a list (as it was e.g. on <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Emperor_293f.html" title="Roman Emperor">Roman Emperor</a>); automatic categorisation implied with the template (some articles using the template relied on it), etc...</li>
</ul>
<p>In short: the "uniform layout" (which is a principle I support in general!) simply didn't work in this particular case, seen the complexities involved, so I used creativity in an attempt to give an appropriate representation. --<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> 22:37, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, Andeggs! I've been using <a href="../../../d/i/o/Template%7EDiocese_347a.html" title="Template:Diocese">Template:Diocese</a> (and <a href="../../../d/i/o/Template%7EDiocese_NoImage_d25f.html" title="Template:Diocese NoImage">Template:Diocese NoImage</a>) on Scottish Episcopalian dioceses, and I feel it gives pages on diocese a good common look. Last year, I overhauled <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_Language_94c8.html" title="Template:Infobox Language">Template:Infobox Language</a>, which has a massive syntax to cope with the number of demands placed on by the varieties of languages in the world. I was wondering how <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/ParserFunctions" class="extiw" title="m:ParserFunctions">ParserFunctions</a> could be used on the template. I've come up with a trial version, which you can see at <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_projects_template_d81b.html" title="User:Garzo/projects/template">User:Garzo/projects/template</a>. It's basically what you wrote with a few parser functions thrown in. The functions allow the same template to be used whether or not there is an image, thereby reducing the need for two separate templates. They also remove the website line if there is no website, and allow the replacement of <i>Archdeaconries</i> with <i>Deaneries</i> or <i>Subdivisions</i> if needed. The idea is that the same template could be used for dioceses throughout the world, whether or not they have arms images, websites or call their subdivisions archdeaconries. You can view some examples at <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_projects_sandbox_495a.html" title="User:Garzo/projects/sandbox">User:Garzo/projects/sandbox</a>. Please let me know what you think of it, and any suggestions you might have.

<p>I disagree with your decision to switch out the tort law templates - the revised template which you are removing divided the intentional torts between personal, dignitary, and property torts, and thus made the template more informative than the old template you are switching it out for. <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_a828.html" title="User:BD2412"><font style="background:gold"><i><b>bd2412</b></i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_4cc0.html" title="User talk:BD2412"><b>T</b></a> 15:18, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>While it is very positive and proactive for you to undertake to "clean up" these templates, please bear in in mind that (1) they are part of a series which can be found at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Law_9b41.html#Resources" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Law">Wikipedia:WikiProject Law#Resources</a>, and it is important that all templates in the series are consistent in appearance, and (2) these templates were developed through a lot of discussion across individual templates as to what should be included and how each should appear.

<dd>Yes I appreciate the thoughts. I started doing this because I felt (quite strongly) that the templates were difficult for users to read if they were unversed in law, too long and not aesthetically pleasing.

<dd>The legislation and SCOTUS infoboxes are not part of it - those should really not be changed without going through the Supreme Court WikiProject, as they voted on just about every aspect of the infoboxes.

<p>I've just reverted a couple and then realised this was meant to be a change across the board. Please can you discuss this at the wikiproject page before changing everything! The older templates had a lot to recommend them. I certainly don't find the newer templates (which are quite different) easier to read than the older ones. Furthermore criminal cases and criminal law are different kinds of things. Can you please try and get consensus on this before doing a hatchet job. Lots of us had become used to the templates, and I suspect a lot of readers have too. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Davey_cdfc.html" title="User:Francis Davey">Francis Davey</a> 16:37, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Also, I have to say that my first reaction was yuk! (just on the appearance) I certainly don't go with the aesthetic! <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Davey_cdfc.html" title="User:Francis Davey">Francis Davey</a> 16:38, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Perhaps we should propose it for discussion at the WikiProject? To tell you the truth, I was never crazy about the old template scheme (even though I came up with most of it) - the blues are too bright! <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_a828.html" title="User:BD2412"><font style="background:gold"><i><b>bd2412</b></i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_4cc0.html" title="User talk:BD2412"><b>T</b></a> 19:15, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've undone most of it - not that your efforts were in the wrong direction, but they constituted a sweeping change which should be discussed first with the community of Wikipedians who maintain law-related articles. Based on your changes, I've added a ton of stuff to the Crim-Pro template, which is now ghastly long and does need to be subdivided (as the torts template did), and I've come across some other articles which need to be merged. I'll work up a proposal over the next few days. Cheers! <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_a828.html" title="User:BD2412"><font style="background:gold"><i><b>bd2412</b></i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_4cc0.html" title="User talk:BD2412"><b>T</b></a> 04:11, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello Andeggs - do you have any ideas, about more that could be done on the law page to improve the what's actually written there, I mean as the content? Are there particular bits that you think are lacking somewhat and could be made more worldwide, or where you would like to know more about something else? I'd like to help! <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidea_24bc.html" title="User:Wikidea">Wikidea</a> 23:34, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>IMHO I think the whole article needs to be rebalanced to reflect the legitimacy of different legal systems and the history of Western legal traditions. Many of the founding principles of our legal systems derive from <a href="../../../c/u/s/Customary_law.html" title="Customary law">customary law</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_law.html" title="Religious law">religious law</a> but I feel these sections are more "tagged on" to the end of the article than properly brought to the fore. There are many societies which today recognise very different legal systems and these should occupy an <i>equal</i> place in the law article. For instance, <a href="http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/lawlink/lawlink_libraries/ll_libraries.nsf/pages/LL_Students_centre_indigenous" class="external text" title="http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/lawlink/lawlink_libraries/ll_libraries.nsf/pages/LL_Students_centre_indigenous" rel="nofollow">this page</a> shows some of the conflict Australia has had with Aboriginal law. In the UK we have 'Jewish courts' (and there is a possibility of Sharia courts too) for civil cases. Wikipedia should cast no aspersions on these, or any, legal systems - indirectly or otherwise.</dd>
<dd>I am not trained as a lawyer and know little about world legal systems. I appreciate you asking me to contribute but I don't want to make poor edits. We need an expert on the subject really. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndeggs_3821.html" title="User:Andeggs">Andeggs</a> (<strong class="selflink">talk</strong> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Andeggs_9856.html" title="Special:Contributions/Andeggs">contribs</a>) 08:03, 7 December 2006 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>Your Fallacy templates are awesome! If there were to be only one required subject (any school level, any major) it should be logic.</p>
<p>Do you know if the "Stolen Concept" fallacy is covered in one of the WP articles? This is where one or more concepts on which an argument logically depends are denied in the argument, i.e., asserting a concept while denying or ignoring its epistemological or genetic roots. Example: "All property is theft" contains this fallacy. The concept of "theft" is derived from, and depends upon the existence of a concept of validly owned property inorder to have a meaning of its own. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveWolfer_b631.html" title="User:SteveWolfer">Steve</a> 20:40, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Andeggs, while the falacy template is not very good it is a start and marginally better than nothing. Could you please do something similar for paradoxes when you have time. Ossie 17:05, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
