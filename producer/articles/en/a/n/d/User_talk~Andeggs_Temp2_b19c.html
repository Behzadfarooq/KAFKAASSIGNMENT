<p>The <a href="../../../h/e/a/Head_of_state.html" title="Head of state">head of state</a> and <i>theoretical</i> source of executive, judicial and legislative power in the UK is the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_monarch.html" title="British monarch">British monarch</a>, currently Queen <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom_e66a.html" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Elizabeth II</a>. However, sovereignty in the UK no longer rests with the monarch, since the <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_of_Rights_1689_2865.html" title="Bill of Rights 1689">English Bill of Rights in 1689</a>, which established the principle of Parliamentary Soverignity. Despite this the Monarch remains Head of State, akin to a <a href="../../../p/r/e/President.html" title="President">President</a> in <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">European</a> (but not <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a>) political tradition and regularly performs <a href="../../../c/e/r/Ceremonial.html" title="Ceremonial">ceremonial</a> functions.</p>
<p>Originally the monarch possessed the right to choose any British <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizen.html" title="Citizen">citizen</a> to be her <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_2cf9.html" title="Prime Minister">Prime Minister</a> and could call and dissolve <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament.html" title="Parliament">Parliament</a> whenever he or she wished. However, in accordance with the current 'unwritten constitution', the Prime Minister is the leader of the largest party in the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Commons_41bc.html" title="House of Commons">House of Commons</a> and Parliament is dissolved at the time suggested by him or her. The monarch retains the ability to deny giving a <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_%28proposed_law%29.html" title="Bill (proposed law)">bill</a> <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Assent_5f14.html" title="Royal Assent">Royal Assent</a>, although in modern times this becomes increasingly more unlikely, as it would cause a constitutional crisis. <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_of_Great_Britain_81c8.html" title="Anne of Great Britain">Queen Anne</a> was the last monarch to exercise this power, which she did on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_11.html" title="March 11">11 March</a> <a href="../../../1/7/0/1708.html" title="1708">1708</a> with regard to a bill "for the settling of Militia in <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>". Other royal powers called <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_prerogative.html" title="Royal prerogative">royal prerogative</a>, such as patronage to appoint ministers and the ability to declare war, are exercised by the Prime Minister and the <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabinet_of_the_United_Kingdom_1af8.html" title="Cabinet of the United Kingdom">Cabinet</a>, with the formal consent of the Queen.</p>
<p>Today the Sovereign has an essentially ceremonial role restricted in exercise of power by convention and public opinion. However the monarch does continue to exercise three essential rights: the <i>right to be consulted, the right to advise and the right to warn</i><sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>. Prime ministers have weekly confidential meetings with the monarch. The longer the monarch reigns the greater the degree of his or her experience and knowledge becomes, and so the meetings become more and more useful.</p>
<p>In formal terms, the <i>Crown in Parliament</i> is sovereign even though in practical terms the political head of the UK is the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom_dd87.html" title="Prime Minister of the United Kingdom">Prime Minister</a> (<a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Blair_f43c.html" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a> since <a href="../../../2/n/d/2nd_May_e085.html" title="2nd May">2nd May</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>). However, the real powers of position of the Monarch in the British Constitution should not be downplayed. The monarch does indeed retain some power, but it has to be used with discretion, for instance with the 1996 sacking of the Australian Prime Minister <sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. She fulfils the necessary constitutional role as head of state, and with the absence of a distinct separation of powers in the American model and a strong second chamber, acts as a final check on executive power. If a time came to pass, for instance, when a law threatened the freedom or security of her <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_subject.html" title="British subject">subjects</a>, the Queen could decline royal assent, free as she is from the eddies of party politics. Furthermore, armed removal of Parliament or Government would be difficult, as the Monarch remains <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commander-in-chief.html" title="Commander-in-chief">commander-in-chief</a> of the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armed_forces.html" title="Armed forces">armed forces</a>, who swear an <a href="../../../o/a/t/Oath_of_allegiance.html" title="Oath of allegiance">oath of allegiance</a> to her.</p>

<p>The Government performs the Executive functions of the United Kingdom. The monarch appoints a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom_dd87.html" title="Prime Minister of the United Kingdom">Prime Minister</a>, guided by the strict convention that the Prime Minister should be the member of the House of Commons most likely to be able to form a Government with the support of the House. The Prime Minister then selects the other Ministers which make up the Government and act as political heads of the various Government Departments. About twenty of the most senior government ministers make up the <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabinet_of_the_United_Kingdom_1af8.html" title="Cabinet of the United Kingdom">Cabinet</a>.</p>
<p>As in other <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliamentary_system.html" title="Parliamentary system">parliamentary systems</a> of government, the executive (called "the government") is drawn from and is answerable to Parliament - a successful <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motion_of_No_Confidence_bbcc.html" title="Motion of No Confidence">vote of no confidence</a> will force the government either to resign or to seek a parliamentary dissolution and a general election. In practice members of parliament of all major parties are strictly controlled by "whips" who try to ensure they vote according to party policy. If the government has a large majority, then they are very unlikely to lose enough votes to be unable to pass legislation. In November 2005, the Blair government suffered its first defeat, on a proposal to extend the period for detaining terrorist suspects to 90 days. However, before this, the last bill proposed by a government that was defeated in the House of Commons was the Shop Hours Bill in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>, one of only three in the 20th century. Governments with a small majority, or coalition governments, are much more vulnerable, and sometimes have to resort to extreme measures, such as "wheeling in" sick MPs, to get the necessary majority. <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margaret_Thatcher_2770.html" title="Margaret Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Blair_f43c.html" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>, for example, were swept into power with such large majorities that even allowing for dissent within their parties, they were assured of winning practically all parliamentary votes, and thus were able to implement radical programmes of legislative reform and innovation. On the other hand, Prime Ministers such as <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Major_5fd6.html" title="John Major">John Major</a> who enjoy only slender majorities can easily lose votes if relatively small numbers of their <a href="../../../b/a/c/Backbencher.html" title="Backbencher">backbench</a> MPs reject the whip and vote against the Government's proposals. As such, Governments with small majorities find it extremely difficult to implement controversial legislation and tend to become bogged down cutting deals with factions within their party or seeking assistance from other political parties.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_service_of_the_United_Kingdom_dd04.html" title="Civil service of the United Kingdom">civil service</a> is a permanent politically neutral organization which supports Government Ministers in carrying out their executive duties. Its constitutional role is to support the Government of the day regardless of which political party is in power. Unlike in some other democracies, senior civil servants remain in post upon a change of Government.</p>
<p>The central core of the civil service is organised into a number of <a href="../../../d/e/p/Departments_of_the_United_Kingdom_Government_c7d3.html" title="Departments of the United Kingdom Government">Departments of State</a>. Each Department is led politically by a senior Minister, supported by a small team of junior Ministers. In most cases the senior Minister is known as a <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secretary_of_State_088f.html" title="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</a> and is a member of the <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabinet_of_the_United_Kingdom_1af8.html" title="Cabinet of the United Kingdom">Cabinet</a>. Administrative management of the Department is led by a head civil servant known in most Departments as a <a href="../../../p/e/r/Permanent_Secretary_dbb2.html" title="Permanent Secretary">Permanent Secretary</a>. The majority of the civil service staff in fact work in <a href="../../../e/x/e/Executive_agency.html" title="Executive agency">executive agencies</a>, which are separate operational organisations reporting to Departments of State.</p>
<p>"Whitehall" is often used as a synonym for the central core of the Civil Service. This is because most Government Departments have headquarters in and around the former Royal Palace of <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitehall.html" title="Whitehall">Whitehall</a>.</p>

<p>One party usually has a majority in Parliament, because of the use of the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Past_the_Post_electoral_system_687b.html" title="First Past the Post electoral system">First Past the Post electoral system</a>, which has been conducive in creating the <a href="../../../t/w/o/Two_party_system.html" title="Two party system">two party system</a> that exists in electoral politics, at least in general election to this day. The monarch normally asks a person commissioned to form a government simply whether it can <i>survive</i> in the House of Commons, something which majority governments can do. In exceptional circumstances the monarch asks someone to 'form a government' <i>with a parliamentary minority</i><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> in the event of no party having a majority, that requires the formation of a <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coalition_government.html" title="Coalition government">coalition government</a>.

<p>The <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Lords_efb8.html" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a> was previously a hereditary, aristocratic chamber. Major reform has been partially completed and it is currently a mixture of hereditary members, bishops of the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_England_2cc6.html" title="Church of England">Church of England</a> and appointed members (life peers, with no hereditary right for their descendants to sit in the House). It currently acts to review legislation formed by the House of Commons, with the power to propose amendments, and exercises a <a href="../../../s/u/s/Suspensive_veto.html" title="Suspensive veto">suspensive veto</a> — it can delay legislation it does not approve of for twelve months.

<p>In addition to the House of Commons, <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> now has its own parliament and <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales.html" title="Wales">Wales</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> have assemblies. (Although the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_Assembly_cf59.html" title="Northern Ireland Assembly">Northern Ireland Assembly</a> is currently suspended.) England, however, has no devolved government between UK Government and local government following the failure of the governments previously proposed regional assemblies - this has led to the formation of democratic reform groups such as <a href="http://www.thecep.org.uk/" class="external text" title="http://www.thecep.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">The Campaign for an English Parliament</a>. Some members of the devolved bodies are elected by a form of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proportional_representation.html" title="Proportional representation">proportional representation</a>. Although the new <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devolved_government.html" title="Devolved government">devolved governments</a> have some legislative and other powers, they do not have anywhere near the power of the UK parliament. There are also fundamental differences between them. For example, the Scottish Parliament has the power to legislate, whereas the <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welsh_Assembly_Government_bdf6.html" title="Welsh Assembly Government">Welsh Assembly Government</a> only has the power to spend the budget formerly allocated to a government department known as the Welsh Office. In addition, as <i>devolved</i> systems of government, they have no constitutional <i>right</i> to exist and can have their powers broadened, narrowed or changed by an Act of the UK Parliament.</p>
<p>Thus, the United Kingdom is said to have a <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unitary_state.html" title="Unitary state">unitary state</a> with a devolved system of government. This contrasts with a <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_republic.html" title="Federal republic">federal</a> system, in which sub-parliaments or state parliaments and assemblies have a clearly defined constitutional <i>right</i> to exist and a <i>right</i> to exercise certain constitutionally guaranteed and defined functions and cannot be unilaterally abolished by Acts of the central parliament.</p>
<p>The present policy of the UK Government is to increase national and regional <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devolution.html" title="Devolution">devolution</a>. The opportunity to elect a regional tier of elected government was to be offered to some of the <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regions_of_England_a07f.html" title="Regions of England">regions of England</a>, was accepted by referendum in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, but was rejected in a referendum in <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_East_England_39af.html" title="North East England">North East England</a> and is now less likely to be offered elsewhere. A movement to obtain some degree of home rule also exists in <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornish_nationalist.html" title="Cornish nationalist">Cornwall</a>, a petition of over 50000 signatures was collected endorsing the call for a Cornish Assembly. However, the UK government is not known to be considering any form of devolution to Cornwall.</p>
<p>It has been said that the process of devolution represents the gradual return of autonomy to the last remaining territories colonised by England that are still under its' control. It is ironic that though they were the first to be conquered and colonised, they would be the last to regain self determination.</p>

<p>Politics in <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> is particularly complex, due to the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Northern_Ireland_dbfd.html" title="History of Northern Ireland">history of Northern Ireland</a>, particularly '<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Troubles_79c5.html" title="The Troubles">The Troubles</a>'. Until the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> the three main parties in <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> were mirrored in Northern Ireland, with the <a href="../../../u/l/s/Ulster_Unionist_Party_8258.html" title="Ulster Unionist Party">Ulster Unionist Party</a> serving as the regional wing of the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29_3ac1.html" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservative Party</a> whilst the small <a href="../../../u/l/s/Ulster_Liberal_Party_437e.html" title="Ulster Liberal Party">Ulster Liberal Party</a> served a similar role for the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_%28UK%29_4ba9.html" title="Liberal Party (UK)">Liberal Party</a>. The <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_Labour_Party_c431.html" title="Northern Ireland Labour Party">Northern Ireland Labour Party</a> was not as strongly tied to the UK <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_Party_%28UK%29_3e02.html" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour Party</a> but the differences were not obvious. Also in existence were the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalist_Party_%28Ireland%29_05d4.html" title="Nationalist Party (Ireland)">Nationalist Party</a> and <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinn_F%C3%A9in_5dd5.html" title="Sinn Féin">Sinn Féin</a>, both of whom were committed to the political <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Ireland_da23.html" title="United Ireland">unification</a> of <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> and the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Ireland_10e7.html" title="Republic of Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a>.</p>
<p>From the late <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> until the mid-<a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>, Northern Ireland was plagued by civil unrest and paramilitarism, known as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Troubles_79c5.html" title="The Troubles">the Troubles</a>. In the process the political parties were greatly disrupted. The <a href="../../../u/l/s/Ulster_Unionist_Party_8258.html" title="Ulster Unionist Party">Ulster Unionist Party</a> discontinued its links with the Conservative Party in protest at the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunningdale_Agreement_f481.html" title="Sunningdale Agreement">Sunningdale Agreement</a>. The <a href="../../../u/l/s/Ulster_Liberal_Party_437e.html" title="Ulster Liberal Party">Ulster Liberal Party</a> remained a part of the now <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Democratic_Party_6a82.html" title="Liberal Democratic Party">Liberal Democratic Party</a> but faced with marginal support it chose to form a sibling relationship with the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Alliance_Party_of_Northern_Ireland_4a36.html" title="Alliance Party of Northern Ireland">Alliance Party</a>. The <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_Labour_Party_c431.html" title="Northern Ireland Labour Party">Northern Ireland Labour Party</a> folded amidst a widespread realignment of political parties; with the British party in theory entering into an alliance, through the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist_International_2aa7.html" title="Socialist International">Socialist International</a> with the nationalist <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_Democratic_and_Labour_Party_cec0.html" title="Social Democratic and Labour Party">Social Democratic and Labour Party</a> and retaining its policy (until recently) of refusing Northern Ireland residents membership of the party. Many other political parties have sprung up representing different strands of <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unionists_%28Ireland%29_90f2.html" title="Unionists (Ireland)">unionism</a>, <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_nationalism.html" title="Irish nationalism">nationalism</a> or cross-community politics, but few have lasted any substantial period of time.</p>
<p>More recently there have been calls for the mainstream <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> parties to organise and stand in elections in <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>. The Conservative Party has done so since the late 1980s but its support has been minimal whilst the Liberal Democrats have continued to endorse Alliance candidates.</p>
<p>The current government of Northern Ireland was established as a result of the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a> <a href="../../../g/o/o/Good_Friday_Agreement_6853.html" title="Good Friday Agreement">Good Friday Agreement</a> (GFA), properly known as the <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belfast_Agreement_6a1b.html" title="Belfast Agreement">Belfast Agreement</a>.</p>
<p>The collapse of the assembly created by the GFA accelerated the polarisation of Northern Ireland's politics, with the SDLP's eclipse by Sinn Féin (both of which are in favour of the agreement) in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a> being mirrored by the anti-GFA DUP overtaking the UUP in the November <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> poll for a new Assembly (which has yet to meet).</p>
<p>The main parties in Northern Ireland are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Unionist_Party_b2cc.html" title="Democratic Unionist Party">Democratic Unionist Party</a> (a hard-line <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unionist.html" title="Unionist">Unionist</a> party)</li>

<li><a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_Democratic_and_Labour_Party_cec0.html" title="Social Democratic and Labour Party">Social Democratic and Labour Party</a> (SDLP) (a <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_democratic.html" title="Social democratic">social democratic</a> <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_nationalist.html" title="Irish nationalist">irish nationalist</a> party)</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/l/l/Alliance_Party_of_Northern_Ireland_4a36.html" title="Alliance Party of Northern Ireland">Alliance Party</a> (a <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal.html" title="Liberal">liberal</a>, cross-community party)</li>

<li><a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_Unionist_Party_7aa1.html" title="UK Unionist Party">UK Unionist Party</a> (a tiny party that serves as a vehicle for <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_McCartney_%28politician%29_08b4.html" title="Robert McCartney (politician)">Robert McCartney</a>, a unionist)</li>
<li>Conservative Party (part of the UK Conservative Party)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many smaller parties both past and present, reflecting the turbulent changes in Northern Ireland politics. Most can be identified as either unionist or nationalist, though a few seek to eschew any position on the "Border Question" (and invariably receive much less support). As a result the question of left-wing or right-wing politics is not as pertinent; although existing parties can be defined at some point on the political spectrum, few seek to promote a left or right wing agenda.</p>

<p>Unlike many European nations, the United Kingdom uses a <a href="../../../f/i/r/First-past-the-post.html" title="First-past-the-post">first-past-the-post</a> system to elect members of Parliament, or MPs. Therefore, elections and political parties in the United Kingdom are affected by <a href="../../../d/u/v/Duverger%27s_Law_a378.html" title="Duverger's Law">Duverger's Law</a>, which causes the agglomeration of related political ideologies into a few large parties with many small parties rarely winning respresentation. Historically, the United Kingdom had two major political parties, though currently three parties dominate the political landscape. Originally, the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29_3ac1.html" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservatives</a> and the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_%28UK%29_4ba9.html" title="Liberal Party (UK)">Liberals</a> dominated British politics, but the Liberal Party collapsed in the early twentieth century and was largely replaced by the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_Party_%28UK%29_3e02.html" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour Party</a>. In the 1980s, the Liberals merged with the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_Democratic_Party_%28UK%29_9a0a.html" title="Social Democratic Party (UK)">Social Democratic Party</a> and have recently experienced a resurgence as the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Democrats_8c75.html" title="Liberal Democrats">Liberal Democrats</a>, enough so to again be considered a major party. In addition to the three major parties, many minor parties contest elections. Of these, few except for regional parties such as the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_National_Party_206a.html" title="Scottish National Party">Scottish National Party</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Unionist_Party_b2cc.html" title="Democratic Unionist Party">Democratic Unionist Party</a> win seats in Parliament.</p>
<p>In the most recent election, the Labour Party won reelection on a reduced majority, with both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats making gains at the expense of Labour.</p>

<p>Various electoral systems are used in the UK:</p>

<li>The <a href="../../../a/d/d/Additional_Member_System_c4fc.html" title="Additional Member System">Additional Member System</a> was introduced after <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devolution.html" title="Devolution">devolution</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a> for the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Parliament_4b1f.html" title="Scottish Parliament">Scottish Parliament</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welsh_Assembly_ca42.html" title="Welsh Assembly">Welsh Assembly</a> and <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Assembly_b67a.html" title="London Assembly">London Assembly</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../s/i/n/Single_Transferable_Vote_c914.html" title="Single Transferable Vote">Single Transferable Vote</a> system is used to elect the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_Assembly_cf59.html" title="Northern Ireland Assembly">Northern Ireland Assembly</a> and Northern Ireland's local councils.

</ul>
<p>In the last few elections, voter mandates for Westminster in the 40% ranges have been swung into 60% parliamentary majorities. No government has won a majority of the popular vote since the <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_National_Government_c29e.html" title="UK National Government">National Government</a> of <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanley_Baldwin_84d4.html" title="Stanley Baldwin">Stanley Baldwin</a> in <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1935_99c6.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1935">1935</a>. Twice since World War II the party with fewer popular votes actually came out with the larger number of seats (in <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1951_ec18.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1951">1951</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1974_%28February%29_7f6a.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1974 (February)">February 1974</a>). One reason for all the quirks is that Britain has many political parties, making it possible to win individual constituencies on less than 50% of the vote due to the opposition votes being divided.</p>
<p>Electoral reform has been considered for <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_elections_bb15.html" title="United Kingdom general elections">general elections</a> many times, but after the <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jenkins_Commission_a379.html" title="Jenkins Commission">Jenkins Commission</a> report in October <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>, which suggested the <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_vote_top-up.html" title="Alternative vote top-up">Alternative vote top-up</a> for <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_elections_bb15.html" title="United Kingdom general elections">general elections</a> was effectively ignored by the government, there have been no further government proposals for reform. It is highly unlikely that electoral reform will happen unless there is a significant change in the balance of power and <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_Party_%28UK%29_3e02.html" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour</a> loses its large majority.</p>
<p>Low turnout is a concern, as the percentage of the electorate who voted in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_2005_e0e0.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 2005">last general election</a> was just 61%.</p>

<p>UK political parties originated in <a href="../../../1/6/6/1662.html" title="1662">1662</a> in the aftermath of the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Civil_War_6bfe.html#Aftermath" title="English Civil War">English Civil War</a>, with the creation of the Court Party and the Country Party, soon becoming known as the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Tory.html" title="Tory">Tories</a> (now the Conservative party, still commonly referred to as 'the Tories') and the <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whig_Party_%28UK%29_3606.html" title="Whig Party (UK)">Whigs</a> (now the Liberal Democrats, though the term 'Whig' has become obsolete). The two remained the main political parties until the <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a>.</p>
<p>The term 'Tory' originates from the Exclusion Bill crisis of <a href="../../../1/6/7/1678.html" title="1678">1678</a>-<a href="../../../1/6/8/1681.html" title="1681">1681</a> - the Whigs were those who supported the exclusion of the Roman Catholic <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_II_of_England_fb06.html" title="James II of England">Duke of York</a> from the thrones of England, Ireland and Scotland, and the Tories were those who opposed it. Both names were originally insults: a "whiggamor" was a cattle driver, and a "tory" was an <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_language.html" title="Irish language">Irish</a> term for an outlaw.</p>
<p>Generally, the Tories were associated with lesser gentry and the Church of England, while Whigs were more associated with trade, money, larger land holders (or "land magnates"), expansion and tolerance. Both were still committed to the political system in place at that time. Neither group could be considered a true political party in the modern sense.</p>
<p>The Rochdale <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radicals_%28UK%29_4abe.html" title="Radicals (UK)">Radicals</a> were a group of more extreme reformists who were also heavily involved in the <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cooperative.html" title="Cooperative">Cooperative</a> movement. They sought to bring about a more equal society, and are considered by modern standards to be left-wing.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>After becoming associated with repression of popular discontent in the years after <a href="../../../1/8/1/1815.html" title="1815">1815</a>, the Tories underwent a fundamental transformation under the influence of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Peel_d3b1.html" title="Robert Peel">Robert Peel</a>, himself an industrialist rather than a landowner, who in his <a href="../../../1/8/3/1835.html" title="1835">1835</a> "<a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamworth_Manifesto_0b26.html" title="Tamworth Manifesto">Tamworth Manifesto</a>" outlined a new "Conservative" philosophy of reforming ills while conserving the good.</p>
<p>Though Peel's supporters subsequently split from their colleagues over the issue of free trade in <a href="../../../1/8/4/1846.html" title="1846">1846</a>, ultimately joining the Whigs and the <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radical_Party_%28UK%29_8522.html" title="Radical Party (UK)">Radicals</a> to form what would become the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_%28UK%29_4ba9.html" title="Liberal Party (UK)">Liberal Party</a>, Peel's version of the party's underlying outlook was retained by the remaining Tories, who adopted his label of Conservative as the official name of their party.</p>
<p>The term '<a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_%28UK%29_4ba9.html" title="Liberal Party (UK)">Liberal Party</a>' was first used officially in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1868.html" title="1868">1868</a>, though it had been in use colloquially for decades beforehand. The Liberal Party formed a government in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1870.html" title="1870">1870</a> and then alternated with the Conservative Party as the party of government throughout the late <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a> and early <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Parliamentary_Party_95a5.html" title="Irish Parliamentary Party">Irish Parliamentary Party</a> was set up to replace the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_Rule_League_f339.html" title="Home Rule League">Home Rule League</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/8/1882.html" title="1882">1882</a>. It remained the third-largest party in British politics until <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a>, often holding the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balance_of_power.html" title="Balance of power">balance of power</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/0/1900.html" title="1900">1900</a>, the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_Party_%28UK%29_3e02.html" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour Representation Committee</a> was established and it changed its name to <b>The Labour Party</b> in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1906.html" title="1906">1906</a>. After the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">First World War</a>, this led to the demise of the Liberal Party as the main liberal force in British politics. The existence of the Labour Party on the left of British politics led to a slow waning of energy from the Liberal Party, ending with it taking third place in national politics. After performing poorly in the elections of <a href="../../../1/9/2/1922.html" title="1922">1922</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/2/1923.html" title="1923">1923</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/2/1924.html" title="1924">1924</a>, the Liberal Party was superseded by the Labour Party as the party of the left.</p>
<p>Following two brief spells in minority governments in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1924.html" title="1924">1924</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/2/1929.html" title="1929">1929</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/3/1931.html" title="1931">1931</a>, the Labour Party had its first true victory after <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> in the <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a> "<a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1945_2336.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1945">khaki election</a>". Throughout the rest of the twentieth century, Labour governments alternated with Conservative governments. The Conservatives were in power for most of the time, with the Labour Party suffering the "wilderness years" of <a href="../../../1/9/5/1951.html" title="1951">1951</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a> (three straight General Election defeats) and <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a> (four straight General Election defeats).</p>
<p>During this second period, right-winger <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margaret_Thatcher_2770.html" title="Margaret Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>, who became leader of the Conservative party in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>, made a fundamental change to Conservative policies, turning the Conservative Party into a staunch right-wing party. In the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1979_73bc.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1979">General Election of 1979</a> she defeated <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Callaghan_5086.html" title="James Callaghan">James Callaghan</a>'s troubled Labour government after the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winter_of_Discontent_27b7.html" title="Winter of Discontent">winter of discontent</a>.</p>
<p>For most of the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>, and the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a> under her successor <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Major_5fd6.html" title="John Major">John Major</a>, Conservative governments pursued policies of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Privatisation.html" title="Privatisation">privatisation</a>, anti-<a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_Union_af21.html" title="Trade Union">trade-unionism</a>, and <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monetarism.html" title="Monetarism">Monetarism</a>, now known collectively as <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thatcherism.html" title="Thatcherism">Thatcherism</a>.</p>
<p>The Labour Party elected left-winger <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Foot_cf4a.html" title="Michael Foot">Michael Foot</a> as their leader after their 1979 election defeat, and he responded to disatisfaction with the Labour Party by pursuing a number of radical policies developed by its grass-roots members. Several right-wing MPs formed a breakaway group in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>, called the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_Democratic_Party_%28UK%29_9a0a.html" title="Social Democratic Party (UK)">Social Democratic Party</a> (SDP), a move which split Labour and is widely believed to have made Labour unelectable for a decade. The SDP formed an alliance with the Liberal Party which contested the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1983_c3e4.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1983">1983</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1987_8979.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1987">1987</a> general elections as a centrist alternative to Labour and the Conservatives. After some initial success, the SDP did not prosper, and was accused by some of splitting the anti-Conservative vote.</p>
<p>The SDP eventually merged with the Liberal Party to form the Liberal Democrats in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>. Support for the new party has increased since then, and the Liberal Democrats (often referred to as LibDems) in 1997 and 2001 gained an increased number of seats in the House of Commons.</p>
<p>Labour were badly defeated by the Conservatives in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1983_c3e4.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1983">general election of 1983</a> and Michael Foot was replaced by <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neil_Kinnock_6f58.html" title="Neil Kinnock">Neil Kinnock</a> as leader of the Labour Party. Kinnock expelled the far left-wing <a href="../../../m/i/l/Militant_Tendency_8f9d.html" title="Militant Tendency">Militant Tendency</a> group, and moderated many of the party's policies. He was replaced by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Smith_%28UK_politician%29_2b76.html" title="John Smith (UK politician)">John Smith</a> after Labour's narrow defeat in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1992_ac6e.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1992">1992 general election</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Blair_f43c.html" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a> became leader of the Labour party after John Smith's sudden death from a heart attack in 1994. He continued to move the Labour Party back towards the right by loosening links with the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_union.html" title="Trade union">unions</a> and embracing many of Margaret Thatcher's policies. This, coupled with the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Profession.html" title="Profession">professionalising</a> of the party machine's approach to the media, helped Labour win the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1997_ac1f.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1997">1997 General Election</a> with a historic landslide result. The Labour Party has moved from being a <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_socialist.html" title="Democratic socialist">democratic socialist</a> party to being a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-liberal.html" title="Neo-liberal">neo-liberal</a> party, giving it three landslide victories but greatly reducing its membership and its support in the electorate.</p>

<p>The Labour Party consolidated its position in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, winning a full second term - a first-time achievement for the Labour Party.</p>
<p>This led to a crisis of confidence in the Conservative Party, which had become complacent with its position as the 'natural party of government' after its 18 years of power. The party's drift to the right lost it nearly all its working-class voters, and its ageing membership (average age 65) and vote (third party among the under 45s) mean that avoiding extinction became a higher priority than winning an election. However, with Labour's recent drop in popularity in 2003-2004 coinciding with Conservatives appointing <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Howard_90a3.html" title="Michael Howard">Michael Howard</a> as leader, the Conservatives appeared to have begun to recover their position as serious challengers to the Labour government. However, Tony Blair's party secured a majority for the third time in May <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, albeit with a greatly reduced majority. In late 2005, the Conservatives replaced Michael Howard with David Cameron, who has brought about a revival of the party's fortunes by trying to improve its old-fashioned image.</p>
<p>Major issues in current British national politics, in descending order of voter concern (as of MORI poll April 2004), are:</p>

<p>Other, smaller, political parties that do not contest elections across the UK and generally seek autonomy or independence for their nation or region are:</p>

<p>Other <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_political_parties_in_the_United_Kingdom_2976.html" title="List of political parties in the United Kingdom">political parties</a> exist, but generally do not succeed in returning MPs to <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament.html" title="Parliament">Parliament</a>.

<p>Among them is the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_National_Party_001b.html" title="British National Party">BNP</a>, a successor party to the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_National_Front_1140.html" title="British National Front">National Front</a>.</p>

<p>There are also a few independent politicians with no party allegiance. This normally occurs only when an MP decides to break with his party in mid-session. Since 1950 only two MPs have been elected as genuine independents, though others have been elected after breaking away from their party:</p>

<p>The UK is divided into a variety of different types of Local Authorities, with different functions and responsibillities, which are further subdivided in rural areas and some urban areas into <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_parish.html" title="Civil parish">parishes</a>.</p>
<p>Local Authorities are responsible for such matters as administering education, public transport, and the management of public spaces. Local authorities are often engaged in <a href="../../../c/o/m/Community_politics.html" title="Community politics">community politics</a>.</p>
<p>Parishes have councils too and some are known as city or town councils. These councils are either made up of elected parish councillors, or in very small parishes, they use direct democracy.</p>
<p>There are two common systems of local government in the U.K.: the old-style two-tier and newer single-tier system. The older (and far more complex) two-tier system consists of <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-metropolitan_district.html" title="Non-metropolitan district">district councils</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Council_8a15.html" title="County Council">County Councils</a>. The District Councils are responsible for rubbish collection, granting planning permission and council housing. County Councils are responsible for education, social services, some public transport, etc..</p>
<p><a href="../../../u/n/i/Unitary_Authority_cc1c.html" title="Unitary Authority">Unitary Authorities</a>, which are in use throughout the whole of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and in some areas in England, have a single tier of local government, and combine District and County Council functions into one body.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_London_d0dd.html" title="Greater London">Greater London</a>, a unique two-tier system exists, with power shared between the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_borough.html" title="London borough">London borough</a> councils, and the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_London_Authority_2294.html" title="Greater London Authority">Greater London Authority</a> which is headed by an <a href="../../../m/a/y/Mayor_of_London_eb29.html" title="Mayor of London">elected mayor</a>.</p>
<p>Unitary authorities often share common public safety authorities with other neighbouring councils. For example, <a href="../../../l/u/t/Luton.html" title="Luton">Luton</a> shares services with Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire and <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milton_Keynes_e083.html" title="Milton Keynes">Milton Keynes</a> shares services with Buckinghamshire.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndeggs_Temp2_b19c.html" title="Edit section: European Union">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">European Union</span></h2>
<p>The United Kingdom is a member of the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_e368.html" title="European Union">European Union</a> (EU). As such, UK citizens elect <a href="../../../m/e/m/Member_of_the_European_Parliament_99f0.html" title="Member of the European Parliament">Members of the European Parliament</a> to represent them in the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Parliament_a87a.html" title="European Parliament">European Parliament</a> in <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brussels.html" title="Brussels">Brussels</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strasbourg.html" title="Strasbourg">Strasbourg</a>. The UK elects 78 MEPs.</p>
<p>In recent years, there have been divisions in both major parties as to whether the UK should form greater ties within the EU, leave things as they are, or reduce the EU's supranational powers. Opponents of greater European integration are known as <a href="../../../e/u/r/Euroscepticism.html" title="Euroscepticism">Eurosceptics</a>, supporters <a href="../../../p/r/o/Pro-European_5dd8.html" title="Pro-European">Pro-Europeans</a>. Divisions over Europe run deep in both major parties, and though the Conservative Party was seen to split over this issue whilst in Government up to 1997, it is the Labour Party which now faces conflicting views within Cabinet over UK involvement in the <a href="../../../e/u/r/Euro.html" title="Euro">Euro</a> and the new <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Constitution_097e.html" title="European Constitution">European Constitution</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../b/r/i/British_nationalism.html" title="British nationalism">British nationalists</a> have long campaigned against EU integration. The strong showing of the eurosceptic United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) in the 2004 European Parliament elections has shifted the debate over UK relations with the EU.</p>
