<p>Ah... in theory, a redirect to the log exists at <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transwiki.html" title="Transwiki">transwiki</a>. In reality, it won't exist unless someone has made it. The example on meta was made up, and there wasn't actually an existing log on <a href="../../../../fr/index.html" class="extiw" title="fr:">fr:</a> until I just created it at <a href="../../../../fr/l/o/g/Wikip%C3%A9dia%7ELog_de_transwiki_0635.html" class="extiw" title="fr:Wikipédia:Log_de_transwiki">fr:Wikipédia:Log de transwiki</a>.</p>
<p>There isn't one on the Sep11 wiki for a different reason. One of the aims of the transwiki namespace was so that people unfamiliar with a project would not have to learn about formatting. However, on Sep11, there is no set formatting, and no regular participants to move things out of the transwiki namespace, so on that project, articles are placed straight into the main namespace and not logged.</p>
<p>Sorry for the confusion. I'll add some more instructions to the page later. The idea is still a work in progress, so it's helpful to find where improvements are needed in the instructions. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 06:38, Apr 17, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Andrew, I hope you will forgive this brief note, which is just to let you know that through serendipitous events, I discovered your sandbox and have left a message in <a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrewa_sandbox_b939.html" title="User talk:Andrewa/sandbox">User Talk:Andrewa/sandbox</a> and am not quite sure if you will notice it. In peace. <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInformation_Habitat_318f.html" title="User:Information Habitat">IH</a></dd>
</dl>
<p><i>Moved from user talk:andrewa/sandbox:</i></p>
<p>Dear Andrew,</p>
<p>Thanks to Wikipedia being down for a couple of hours, I discovered the wikipedia irc channel, and immediately say the message about other wikipedia channels, which I went to when Wikipedia was back up, discovering, inter alia, #mediation.wikipedia - which I plan to visit tomorrow - it's almost 2 am now - and #enrc.wikipedia, which I logged into and found interesting as a way of geting a sense of what is being posted. I might add that I edited the page, adding my IRC nickname, correcting a couple of typos, and making the list of IRC channels clickable,</p>
<p>I checked back on #enrc.wikipedia from time to time and noticed your entry for User:Andrewa/sandbox. Given your role re the VfDs for pages I have created, I naturally decided to look at the page, which I discovered to be dominated with images of the peace cubes and links to pages I had created and - pages where you were appear concerned that I might emerge under another name - which I am not planning to do - except that I would like to change User:Information-Ecologist to User:Information Ecologist, if that can be doene easily, as there will be times when I may want to contribute to Wikipedia in a personal rather than an organizational capacity, and since creating that user name, I discoverd that ther is no problem with spaces in user names</p>
<p>Given that it seems clear that were are on each other's minds these days, and that we both seem to want to find a win-win resolution I wondered whether it might be helpful if we could communicate in a real time conversation, either:</p>
<p>by phone, which is somewhat problematic mostly due to the time differential (I live in New York city) and my not having a sense of your schedule; cost is an issue as I am on a very limited budget, but not prohibitive as I use relatively inexpensive phone cards - or</p>
<p>using IRC - either #mediation.wikipedia or a separate chanel - eg #ihwil.wikipedia - as I have found IRC to be an excellent medimm for thoughtful and constructive dialogue Btw, I tried again to phone a while ago, but your line was busy each time I called, and you hadn't been in when I phoned about ten days ago so it does seem that IRC would make more sense.</p>
<p>If you are open to this, could you leave a message here and I will come back tomorrow.</p>
<p>Incidentally, given my interest in your sandbox, your rationale for marking all edits as minor is no longer valid and although it doesn't bother me personally if you mark them as minor - I will still look at all the changes - there is much to be said in favor of maintaining accurate records.</p>
<p>I have to go to bed now, which I will do after posting a brief note in your sandbox to let you know I have visited it and made this entry - in case you don't notice that there is a message her, and I look forward to a response from you.</p>
<p>In peace</p>

<dd>I'd prefer to communicate via talk pages, or by personal email to andrewa @ alder . ws (leave the blanks out of course). However if you wish to telephone, the best numbers are:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>+ 61 (2) 9441 4476</li>
<li>+ 61 (4) 2525 4476 (mobile).</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The telephone number you tried before is actually no longer mine (although I did get your message), and is often occupied by an Internet dialup connection, as you have discovered. Try to take timezones into account please if telephoning, even my mobile is normally on while I'm asleep next to it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The sandbox talk page is probably not a good place for this discussion, I would not have looked there except by accident, nor is the sandbox itself. Not that it does a lot of damage, it's just annoying and unnecessary IMO, because those pages have a purpose and it's not that, and I get no automatic notification of messages there. This is however exactly what this page is here for.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'd be delighted to hear from you here, or by email. These are my preferred methods because they allow non-synchonous communication. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 13:35, 19 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your message today. I will follow through in the morning on the requests for speedy deletion, and will also explore refactoring - I just glanced at it so far - and also the SQL Query, and will double-check Florence Nightingale for spelling and syntax errors. As you may have seen, I have created Information Habitat/Sandbox into which I have pasted a copy of your sandbox and have done some reorganizing and sorting to see what I can learn from the information you had assembled &amp; have also created Information Habitat/Contributions whre I am organizing my user contributions.</dd>

<p><i>Why did you delete this? It seemed like a good potential article to me, or a redirect if not. But more important, it was listed on VfD and the vote hadn't yet completed. Or have I missed something? Andrewa 22:25, 19 Apr 2004 (UTC)</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>My apologies. I was unaware that it was on VfD. Snowspinner moved the content to <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_the_Catholic_Church_bdda.html" title="Criticism of the Catholic Church">Criticism of the Catholic Church</a>. That left a redirect from <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> to <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_the_Catholic_Church_bdda.html" title="Criticism of the Catholic Church">Criticism of the Catholic Church</a>, and being not knowing about the VfD discussion, you can see why I wouldn't want to leave THAT redirect in place&#160;;-). Sorry for the confusion. If the VfD discussion has not yet noted the new location of the material they were discussing, I'll post a comment there. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 22:40, 19 Apr 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Oh, and the reason I didn't redirect to <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholicism.html" title="Catholicism">Catholicism</a>, as someone has now done, is that I wanted to preserve the distinction between the Catholic Church and the Roman Catholic Church, which is commonly misunderstood but significant. I'm still hoping that someone will write a real article at <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>, and move over some of the material from <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholicism.html" title="Catholicism">Catholicism</a>.</dd>

<p>I'm flattered.&#160;:-) Sure, feel free to use my greeting, and feel free to suggest changes to it. I spend a fair amount of time on issues related to newcomers, but I'm an inconsistent greeter myself – I do it when it suits my mood, or when a new user catches my eye. As you said though, I do keep it updated. Actually it just went through a major change as I deleted a lot of links in favor of a link to the <a href="../../../t/u/t/Wikipedia%7ETutorial_f7c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Tutorial">Tutorial</a>. That's part of the original motivation for the Tutorial, actually: to keep the welcome messages shorter and more flexible.</p>

In fact, anyone is free to make comments in any way they want on any page. I just ask that you don't edit mine, and allow me to edit mine. I really think that's something which is allowed <i>without</i> a warning. And my intention is not to use it in all cases. I wish there were some easy way to have multiple signatures, but since there isn't I simply put the warning on every message I sign. As for experimenting with unthreaded discussion, using this topic as the example, I've already posted most of my argument on User:Anthony DiPierro/warning. Feel free to add a counter-argument there, if you'd like. If I get a chance I might add some responses to your counter-arguments, but this topic isn't really a high priority of mine. By the way, also see <a href="../../../d/r/u/Talk%7EDrug_addiction_ba44.html" title="Talk:Drug addiction">Talk:Drug_addiction</a>, specifically the sections <b>Drug addiction should be kept as a page separate from addiction</b> and <b>Drug addiction <i>is</i> addiction</b> for an example of unthreaded discussion in action. -anthony</dd>

<dd>There are times when you have made comments that were IMO patently ridiculous. Without your warning, such comments would have received a comment from me, hopefully a constructive one that would have allowed you to reply. However my comment would have been short, as thread mode allows, and would have taken little time to compose. I was not prepared to take the far greater time needed to compose a self-contained comment (such as this one). So either you got away with a ridiculous comment, or you missed an opportunity to clarify it. We'll never know which, as your comment is now buried in the history and there's no easy way to retrieve it. But either way, IMO the discussion was poorer for my being unable to answer you.</dd>

<dd>I think this thread is a great example of the problems with threaded discussion. It seems we've both wrote a lot, and said very little. For instance, in that last paragraph, you make a good point, and ask a supposedly rhetorical question, but I have no idea what your intention is to tie that into the rest of the discussion. I'm beginning to wonder if you're just being argumentative for the sake of being argumentative. Are you trying to get me to change my policy of modifying my comments? Because that just isn't going to happen. What exactly is your intention with this discussion?</dd>

I hope by this discussion to learn myself and to give you and others the opportunity to learn too, and that we'll all be better able to contribute to Wikipedia as a result. I'm not enjoying this as an argument, I have better things to do than argue. IMO your warning does still need updating, I agree that your proposal to mention my talk page as an explicit exception there sounds silly, but I think that you can do better if you try. I don't expect you to abandon the policy of modifying your comments, nor want you to. Ideally, we'll come up with a convention that allows you and others to do exactly this on talk pages, the Pump and similar pages without any of the problems I see at present. That would really rock. Perhaps a rewrite of your warning is all that it would take, I don't yet know. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 07:08, 27 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Eight indents is about my limit before taking action to reduce them, otherwise even a simple two-person discussion starts to suffer from what Meatball calls ThreadMess, and this hasn't been a simple discussion. So we should think of some sort of archive and/or refactor.
