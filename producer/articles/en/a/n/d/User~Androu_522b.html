<p>Before we begin, let us concern ourselves with the famous tale of a more famous beast, one that defies every physical law which governs the quintessential nature of the Universe. From the primitive laws of Newtonian Mechanics to the intricacies of Quantum Theory, this animal defies the logic which we have built over the years.</p>
<p>His name is Shannon the Scavenger</p>
<p><a name="Theories_on_his_Conception" id="Theories_on_his_Conception"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrou_522b.html" title="Edit section: Theories on his Conception">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Theories on his Conception</span></h3>
<p>It is definitely not clear where he was conceived. Some claim that the earth vomited out onto the Garden of Eden many eons ago - a creature conceived in the belly of the planet one may say. This is, however, only speculation of his true origins.</p>
<p>Others claim that in the beginning after light was created, a photon, just days after its creation, gained consiousness and transformed itself into its physical manifestation - which is Shannon the Scavenger. Yet others proclaim that he was a by-product of the wrath of a strange nation living in the Andromeda Galaxy. Called the "Vengers", these humanoid creatures were disgusted with the filth they themselves concocted on their planet. They took a small animal and fed it a dead body, and over time this animal became Shannon the Scavenger. The theory goes on to describe how the Scavenger ("Sca" + "venger" = cleaner of the people) took on its wave function and became a quark then traveled 2.4 million light years in a fraction of a second to arrive at planet earth. This theory is however not famous with Scientists because it fails to explain many other strange characteristics of this scavenger.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrou_522b.html" title="Edit section: His True Conception">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">His True Conception</span></h3>
<p>The most common misconception about Shannon the Scavenger is that he is about half a million years old which is far from the true value of about the same age as the planet itself. Around 5 Billion years ago, after the Creation of the Earth and its primitive life forms took a hold of the planet, somewhere deep in the lush gardens of Ancient Babylon the mouth of the earth spewed out a creature. This Creature was conceived in the belly of the earth and its main function was the keeper and cleaner of the earth. The story goes to say that after vomiting out this creature, the earth uttered these words:</p>
<p>"Out of my belly thou art conceived, and on mine surface thou shall dwell; not as an inhabitant, but as the purger of my facade. Dead bodies thou shalt consume, decaying matter on which thou shalt feed upon, thou shall keep my skin clean, and purify it of dead objects thou shall do. Thou shall stay in that way until the end of time. The Gracious Lord has provided you with untold abilities with which you shall perform these duties and by the Grace of The Creator, thou shall fulfill your duties as a Scavenging Beast. I hereby declare you Shannon the Scavenger"</p>
<p>After these things came to pass, Shannon the Scavenger grew into a mighty beast.</p>

<p>Shannon the scavenger is no ordinary scavenger such as the seagull, the pigeon, Androu, the squirrel and, more recently, the Shoe, the sandal, the bed, the boot, and an elusive other creature called "Scarborough". {‘Scarborough’ is allegedly the instrument used by Androu to convey the stories of Shannon the Scavenger. Scarborough has since then lost his ink and has been scavenging around in many corners of the universe looking for anything to eat. There is speculation that he has joined a rebellion with the Renegade Shoes of North America in an attempt to bring down what the group calls the “Capitalist Curtain”. The group, headed by worn-out shoes, seeks an end to “capitalist dictatorial nations” and to establish a “shoeocracy”, where shoes are glorified and sandals and beds are tortured and gassed (more on this later)}</p>
<p>Shannon has the unique ability to defy every known law of the physical universe. Indeed, if all his powers were examined, the laws of nature can be deduced by merely taking the inverse of each characteristic. According to a famous teller of his tales, perhaps the most famous, this scavenger has an infinite number of neurons. It is speculated that inside his skull, the space time continuum is , thereby creating an infinite amount of universes in which knowledge can be stored. His neurons, according to another elusive creature called “Mina” (who is smaller than all his constituting quarks), Shannon the scavenger has neurons that are about 1000 kilometers wide and 10,000 km long, with a width of about 999 meters. Mina has been very valuable in the quest to learn more about Shannon because he is the smallest creature/particle in the universe. At times, Mina even mistakenly takes on his wave function because of his miniscule size. Mina is so small that if you determine the diameter of the quark that he is composed of, it is many times larger than his actual diameter, which approches negative length. At one point, he was kidnapped by a pair of abandonned sandals in the so called <i>Sandaliamina</i> Hostage Incident [more about that later]. He makes a characteristic buzzing sound whenever he flies - "buzz".</p>
<p>Shannon, among other things, can create light, energy, life, mass, matter, and electricity from a vacuum. Some scientists speculate that he takes advantage of quantum fluctuations in the vacuum but, as with all other information about this elusive creature, nothing is certain.</p>

<p>Scarborough is probably the most famous pen which staunchly declares that It was the instrument used to pen the great stories of Shannon the Scavenger.</p>
<p>Scarborough is one of many clones produced by a local High School in a suburb of the northern nation of Canada. Being one of thousands of look alikes, Scarborough was a very sad pen, for he knew his fate would be the same as that of all other pens, certain doom and destruction. After Androu took a hold of this pen, Androu penned the long tales of the Great Shannon the Scavenger. The pen went on to share international fame with his bearer, Androu and all the pens of the Northern Hemisphere referred to Androu eventually as "The Pen-bearer". All was going well for Scarborough until the fateful day of his <a href="../../../i/n/k/Ink.html" title="Ink">ink</a> running out. Androu, being finished with the pen, reportedly tortured him and threw him into the bowels of the deep. Scarborough, however, did not cease to exist.</p>

<p>It is uncertain when the ancestral shoe evolved and diverged from the more ancient sandal lineage, although early archaelogists suggests mocassins as the most likely outgroup. From an early time onward, shoes begin to displace sandals in many areas, leading to backlash and resentment among the indigenous sandals, who claimed the newcomers were impure, inferior creatures. The negative shoe-sandal relations that have not ceased to this day is thought to have stemmed from these early conflicts, although more recent events have also added fuel to the fire.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrou_522b.html" title="Edit section: The Beds">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Beds</span></h2>
<p>The beds, large and bulky are typically sedentary creatures, though they can occasionally lash out in anger and thrash about their huge bodies when provoked Being slept on, punched and pouted on, cried on, and listening to their owners' lamentations and rants about life in general through the years have left a mark on the beds' psychology and worldview. Beds are generally cynical creatures, though none too bright and yet are clumsy and do not like social contact too often.</p>
<p>The Beds, like the Sandals, shoes, and boots, are divided into many waring factions which quite naturally despise each other. Their organization is very poor, and small civil disputes usually erupt into civil bed wars, where beds of the same kind kill one another in bloody conflicts. Left alone they are sedentary creatures, but provoke them and they will lash out with a blood hurling scream and shout.</p>

<p>Probably the most suicidal species on the face of universe, this species has especially baffled scientists and logicians alike. With a strong tendency to commit suicide in small situation, these sandals will strap themselves with explosives and commit suicide, sometimes in public areas like malls or schools.</p>

<p>The Sandals claim a long heritage dating back to the dawn of human beings and the first civilizations. Historians tell us that the first sandals were made by the Egpytian civilization in an effort to protect there feet against the unforgiving heat of the desert sand. The sandals took the blunt of the head, and many claim that it was this heat that caused their neurons to malfunction in such a way that encourages suicide. The Southern Chinese and Asian civilizations also began wearing sandals at the same time to, unlike the Egyptians, protect their feet from monsoons and the wet seasons. Some speculate that it is the combination of harsh desert weather and wet warm weather that caused the chemical imbalance which now plagues many sandal populations across the planet.</p>
<p>The sandals then went through civilization with the humans. First the Egyptians and Chinese, then came along the Mesopotamians and the Babylonians who wore the sandals frequently during war. This prolonged exposure to war has lead some to postulate that it was this that caused their uber-cynicism about humans, shoes, and many other species. There first exposure to shoes came during the Roman empire, when Rome invaded the northern lands were shoes were preferred over sandals. There is considerable debate amongst scholars about who came first, the sandal or the shoe.</p>

<p>The sandals are a fragile species, a simple knock or kick will destroy them quite readily. Unlike the shoes, boots, or beds, sandals are very prone to any little knock and this is the reason, some psychoanalysist claim, that makes them suicidal. Being very politically and socially disorganized, there politics borders on the anarchic - making them very emotionally unstable creaturs. Many factions of the sandals are quite organized, the biggest one being The Secret Sandal Society of South America (TSSSOSA) which was created in main opposition to the RSOSA led by warlord NaA. The TSSSOSA main base is located in the tropical Amazon jungles of Brazil, but no one is yet clear of their exact location. The group is an international organization with bases all across the world the biggest being in Warsaw, Frankfurt, Manchester, Calcutta, Shanghai, LA, Cairo, Algers, Java, and Perth. The FBI, CIA, and MI5 has has been trying to expose this organization to the world but has thus far failed to do so. The TSSSOSA use very unconvential ways of attacking main capitalist areas across the planet, there most famous being the "round-about suicide" technique where the sandals gather around the target, strap themselves together, and simultaneously blow themselves up, causing the complete destruction of the target and of the surrounding area.</p>
<p>The leader of the TSSSOSA is a feminist by the name of Sandy the Sandal. There are some reports that Sandy and NaA had a relationship sometime in the past and a young child was the product of this short marriage. There are many who claim to be this child, but the most convincing seems to come from a sock by the name of Stew the Sock. He claims that he clearly remembers living with NaA and Sandy before their divorce when after they report</p>

<p>There have been many historical references to the newts, the most famous being made by Sinbad the sailor while he cruised the vast Indian Ocean. It is written that Marco Polo also came across these creatures, but made a truce with the species by sacrificing half his crew.

<p>The newt's main source of nutrition include Human sailors, divers, sharks, blue whales (which they hunt with spears and javlins), komodo dragons, and dinosaurs. They speak ancient sanskrit and another language which is called the reptilian tongue by some linguists (it is characteristic of periodic hissing and triling of the tongue).

<p>Their culture is a militaristic/tribal type, where honour is held in high esteem. Some also report that they have a caste system where some newts can take advantage of the other ones. Newts usually wear a bandana and the king wears a crown made of solid stone with a pebble in the middle of it. Apparently, they claim this pebble can destroy the universe claiming that it is a meteor. However, the pebble is probably nothing more than a beach stone. There are three species of Newts</p>

<p>These are probably the most famous species of Newts - a tribal warlike species which roam the Indian ocean every year in search of breeding grounds. Their main headquarters is somwhere on the Maldivian Islands, although no one is quite sure where exactly. However, satellite photography from NASA and the French Space Agency confirm that their base is off the coast of Madagascar near the Maldives.</p>
<p>This species has been rarely seen - those that have usually never live to tell about it. Extremely rare photographs, however, have been taken of the Newt Base and of a Newt in a bamboo forest.These photos confirm what scientists have theorized since the days of Sinbad, this species is a nomadic species, rarely settling in one area for more than a few weeks. Legend has it that Marco Polo had to sacrifice half his crew to the newts in order to cross the Indian. Historians point to the lack of explorers in China in the 11th and 12th centuries as indicators that explorers new of the prescense of this species. Some maps even write "Here Be Dragons" in areas where it was thought that Newts lived.</p>
<p>The Newt diet is a carnivorous one, always killing animals both small and large and consuming them. Their most famous diet, as a rare record had it, was roasted Human on a spit, spiced up with Curry, salt, and pepper and sprinkled with human and cow blood. The newts have also been known to gang up on dinosaurs. Newts cannot live on plants, and so their diet is usually meat or fish. Occasionaly, they will feast on chicken eggs and rat venom.</p>
<p>The Maldivian newts are bipedal creatures, and the average newt has a bandana on all the time. The Newts have adopted a sort of caste system, but it usually does not discriminate against those of a lower caste.</p>

<p>The Pacific Newts are a species which were driven out by the CIA in the late 40s from their islands. The islands were subsequently used for nuclear nesting, and much of the homeland has now been completely destroyed. As a result, the newts have evolved gills and now live below the ocean surface, in caves and creavases. There, some claim they are plotting the destruction of the Human race.</p>

<p>The Orchids are a flora with distinct thoughts and feelings. They have the mental ability of a fully grown newt yet have the same photosynthetic capacity as Shannon the Scavenger. The Orchids are a carnivorous species, however, because they evolved the ability to grow a mouth, tongue, and appetite for mammals both small and large. The Orchids have their main base in South Africa, on the Table Mountain where explorers claim that the trone is located. Only few explorers have truly commuinicated with the Orchids because many others were either eaten or sacrificed to the "sun God Amun".</p>

<p>Also called the felion, this mysterious creature has been said to roam the southern coast of Madagascar. The species, which was thought to be created in a lightning-storm a few years before the Ultimate War of the Humans (2012). Also called the Prionailurus electricas (greek for electric cat) this species has been said to emit not only copius amounts of electric energy, some estimates say that it is about 52,000 times the amount emitted by the electric eel. The species seems to show advanced intellectual thought, 1 book has been published by a well known felion called "The New Age of the Cats and Ions". In it, Felixander II proclaims that one day, the felions will rule the world with an iron, yet conducting, fist.</p>
<p>The main physical featurs of this species are webbed feet, 3 eyelids, a difunctional brain, and a yellow fur coat. Apparently, the felions claim that in order to perform a thought process, a quantum fluctuation must take place in the vacuum of one of their brains (the Dorsal area). After, the fluctuation then travels to the frontal lobe (the second brain), where the fluctuation is converted into hexadecimal numbers. The hexadecimal is then converted to binary and that is, in turn, converted to a strange number system called monary, where the only number used is 0.</p>
<p>Using a series of complex enzymes, the 0s are then transformed to complex molecules similar to the human neuron. According to Mina, this theory "holds water". The felions are a socialist species, where all political power is distributed evenly amongst the population. The great political scientist Catl Marx proclaims that this is the ideal of a society and that all species will eventually transform to this system. The leader of the cats, Catlin leninyx who, although holds no true power, is merely an ambassador from the felions to the Newts.</p>

<p>Hello, my name is Androu.</p>
<p>Members of the Homo sapien species, what have we done? While destroying the very thing we quibble over, earth, we wage war over ideologies and differences, the very things which distinguish us from many other species. Opinion has often been suppressed, and men are ridiculed over their view points which will often never be disproved. We have created governments which rule us, and we then attempt to change it every 4 some years. What foolishness.</p>
<p>We are doomed as a species, for our own kind is set out to destroy us. The following is/are (an )essay(s) I have written which address the dire condition of men.</p>
<p><a name="Essay_1:_Sounds" id="Essay_1:_Sounds"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrou_522b.html" title="Edit section: Essay 1: Sounds">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Essay 1: Sounds</span></h2>
<p>Sounds, they tell a lot about a society. Perhaps, somewhere in America, it is the sound of a child overcome with joy as he enters the gates of Disney Land; or maybe it is the clanging of cutlery, the clinking china plates, and the simmer of a seasoned, warm turkey dinner as a family gathers around the kitchen table – a resonance attenuated with laughs of children coupled with tender voices exchanging fond memories. Somewhere in the Middle East, however, thousands of miles away from America, a chillingly different, yet loud and distinct, noise can be heard. The cry of an orphan, waddling in his own filth, the wail of a weeping widow, as she loses her second husband to war, the melodic ‘Allah Akbr’ chanting of a strapped suicide bomber, as he prepares himself, and the sound of a bellowing mosque echo across the sands of Ancient Babylon. While the United States of America keenly flexes a muscle in Iraq, hoping to impress an otherwise troubled planet, terrorism is encouraged, hate for America and Israel is perpetuated, children become orphans, wives become widows, and most fearsome for many politicians, crude oil prices rise.</p>
<p>One need not look far to see the short-term results of the Iraq war, for bloody headlines are secreting scary statistics. Across newspapers of North America, banners read of mosques being blown up, soldiers losing their lives due to car bombs, suicide bomber killing innocent civilians, and warnings of imminent civil war in an already unstable county. However, if one is not moved by pictures of dead civilian bodies laying the streets spattered with red blood, a flip of the page can reveal unsettling reports on imminent international recession and inflation, a situation realized in the 1970’s due to sharp increase in oil prices. Many war-supporters, not aware of possible international boycott on American items due to an unwanted presence, will immediately point to World War II as a perfect example of economic stability being achieved because of war. This is foolishness - the world has changed and I beg to differ. Take the substantially reduced prospects of US retailers due the scorching of KFC franchises in Pakistan after the invasion of Afghanistan. Boycott at this level against all American merchandise is clearly lethal. Waged internationally, and the situation becomes hopeless.</p>
<p>A prolonged war will cause economic recession in developing countries, leading to a decrease in exports to developed nations. Coupled with that will be an increase in spending on national security, as the US becomes more prone to attack by terrorists attempting retaliatory actions. The Congressional Budget Office has already estimated a 0.1% decrease in growth rate as direct result of increased national security along with a 670,000 decrease in jobs . Negative war outcome would also, according to William Nordhaus, lead to economic recession - lowering the GDP of United States by 2.4%. With Iraq lying on 10% of the world’s oil reserves, a continuation of the war in Iraq is economic suicide in a highly competitive international economy. With a slow withdrawal of American troops from Iraq over the course of next year coupled with an increase in economic aid to sectors, such as the policing, Iraq will once again rebuild its immune system and become a self-sustaining nation, capable of protecting its law-abiding citizens and chastising the remaining ones.</p>
<p>Einstein once wisely stated that “I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.” How true. <b>Like a group of young boys standing waist deep in gasoline inside a large room, all arguing over who has the most lightened matches, yet all knowing that one dropped would single their demise, so too the world proliferates weapons of doom without truly realizing their destructive capabilities</b>. Indeed, only mutually assured destruction (MAD) and international war law stands between the present and human extermination. Ignoring this straightforward fact, the USA has paraded their ‘smart bombs’ in the Iraq war, even coining witty terms such as “Shock and Awe” to further impress the international audience. What immaturity. It is even more disturbing to realize, however, that while the Unites States churns out $518, 000, 000, 000 on ‘educating’ their murder machines , 18% of the world population lacks basic literacy skills . Hoping to root out terrorists, America has used the finest technology on earth in an attempt to fulfill its grand objective. Unfortunately, Osama Bin Laden is still at large, and American conventional warfare is not working too well against the terrorists. For instance, former President Bill Clinton once deployed 80 state-of-the-art Tomahawk missiles each $750, 000 to in an attempt to destroy Osama Bin Laden, but failing to do so . On September 11, 2001, the terrorists lost 19 individuals and $500, 000 on a series of attacks that killed over 2800 Americans and leaving the economy a projected $ 125, 000, 000, 000 short . So much for American conventional warfare.</p>
<p>However, with its nuclear arsenal over 10,000 strong, no country will ever dare to mount a Pearl-Harbor style attack on the US for obvious reasons. Can nuclear weapons then act as deterrence for non-nuclear war, which would drag on considerably longer yet have infinitely less destructive fallout as nuclear war? Before anymore is discussed, the term terrorism must first be properly defined. As defined by The Random House Dictionary of the English Language, terrorism is “the use of violence to intimidate or coerce, especially for political purposes”&#160;; and there is no doubt that the individuals who attacked on 9/11 were terrorists in their purist form. However, can the United States along with members of the nuclear club, through their intimidation with colossal nuclear arsenals, be considered terrorist states, keeping in mind that they intimidate other states? Are the 10,000+ American nuclear weapons , each capable of killing a million people, yet collectively capable of the complete obliteration of planet earth, really required for self-defense purposes? Are terrorists, through their coercion, really challenging American military dominance, or is their objective meant to scrutinize American foreign policy and inflict damage on morale? Begging answers, these questions also shed light on the true intentions of armed states: to terrorize one another.</p>
<p>To demand all armed nations to give up their nuclear weapons is nothing more than a vain attempt to change the world, for in a world where stakes are high, nuclear weapons assert military dominance and establish fear into the hearts of the enemies of those who own them. However, by establishing frequent meetings of members of the ‘Nuclear Club’ and applying heavy international pressure on these countries to dismantle their weapons of doom, armed countries would feel obliged to lower their nuclear arsenal. As the only world superpower, the United States must exemplify this: to dismantle 90% of their arsenal thereby providing a stepping stone on which other countries can build on. Russia, Great Britain, France, China, India, and Pakistan, would then feel obliged to decrease their nuclear arsenal by the same percentage. Few will clam this to be imminent while others will claim it to be impossible – I say let us work together to make the impossible imminent.</p>
