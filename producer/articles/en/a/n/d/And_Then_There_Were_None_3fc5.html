<p>In the supposed order of death:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Anthony James Marston</b>, a young man. His three loves are fast cars, women and foot-long hotdogs. An almost perfect specimen of a man born to a wealthy family, he's vain and self-absorbed with little time for the lower orders of society who he may have harmed at one point in the past.</li>
<li><b>Mrs. Ethel Rogers</b>, the nervous housekeeper and cook. One of the first people to come to the island, she's respectable and efficient but seems scared of something and is always looking over her shoulder. She may have a good reason.</li>
<li><b>General John Gordon MacArthur</b>, a retired World War I hero. He's now a lonely but still proud man who has lost contact with his old friends in the military and has, according to the rumors, more than a few skeletons in his closet.</li>
<li><b>Mr. Thomas Rogers</b>, the butler, Mrs. Rogers' husband. One of the first people to come to the island, he's respectable, efficient but with no imagination. Every inch the model English butler - but appearances may be deceptive.</li>
<li><b>Emily Caroline Brent</b>, an elderly spinster and a religious zealot. A woman of unyielding principles who uses the Bible to justify anything and her inability of showing compassion or understanding for others may have caused suffering in the past.</li>
<li><b>Justice Lawrence Wargrave</b> ("the Hanging Judge"), a retired judge famous for the many death sentences he pronounced in his career: he may have used the letter of the law to evade the spirit of the law on occasions.</li>
<li><b>Dr. Edward George Armstrong</b>, a Harley Street surgeon. Worked his way up the social ladder but lately he has become tired with the long working hours with little reprieve. Has an extremely addictive personality which may have got him into trouble in the past.</li>
<li><b>William Henry Blore</b>, a retired police inspector, now a private investigator. A big, hulking and bullying man who solved a series of robberies during his police days but may not have been entirely honest about his methods.</li>
<li><b>Philip Lombard</b>, a soldier of fortune. Travelled most of the world and has a reputation of being a good man in a tight spot: he has apparently "sailed very near the wind" on occasion due to shady activities. Literally down to his last square meal, he comes to the island with a loaded <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolver.html" title="Revolver">revolver</a>.</li>
<li><b>Vera Elizabeth Claythorne</b>, a young teacher and ex-governess. Forced to take mostly secretarial jobs since her last job as a governess dried up. The details of her break up with her fiancee are clouded in mystery.</li>

<p>As the novel opens, ten people journey toward a house on a fictitious place called Indian Island off the coast of Devon. Upon arriving, each person finds a slightly odd bit of bric-a-brac in his or her room: a framed copy of a nursery rhyme, <i>Ten Little Indians</i> hanging on the wall:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ten little Indians went out to dine;
<ul>
<li>One choked his little self and then there were Nine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nine little Indians sat up very late;
<ul>
<li>One overslept himself and then there were Eight.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Eight little Indians traveling in Devon;
<ul>
<li>One said he'd stay there and then there were Seven.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Seven little Indians chopping up sticks;
<ul>
<li>One chopped himself in halves and then there were Six.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Six little Indians playing with a hive;
<ul>
<li>A bumble bee stung one and then there were Five.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Five little Indians going in for law;
<ul>
<li>One got into Chancery and then there were Four.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Four little Indians going out to sea;
<ul>
<li>A red herring swallowed one and then there were Three.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Three little Indians walking in the Zoo;
<ul>
<li>A big bear hugged one and then there were Two.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Two little Indians sitting in the sun;
<ul>
<li>One got frizzled up and then there was One.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>One little Indian left all alone;
<ul>
<li>He went out and hanged himself</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And then there were none.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the guests gather in the parlor after dinner the first night, a mysterious gramophone recording informs them that all ten of them have been found guilty of murder, although in each case the killings could not be dealt with by the law.</p>
<ul>
<li>Marston, ran over and killed two children named John &amp; Lucy Combes while driving recklessly, but due to his wealth and position in society, he was never properly prosecuted and simply had his <a href="../../../d/r/i/Driver%27s_license.html" title="Driver's license">driver's license</a> withdrawn;</li>
<li>Mr. and Mrs. Rogers let their invalid employer Jennifer Brady die of neglect;</li>
<li>General Macarthur sent his wife's lover Lt. Arthur Richmond on a suicide mission during the war;</li>
<li>Miss Brent's maid Beatrice Taylor committed suicide after being cruelly kicked out of the household when she became pregnant;</li>
<li>Wargrave knowingly sentenced Edward Seton, a supposedly innocent defendant, to hang;</li>
<li>Armstrong performed an operation while drunk and killed Louisa Mary Clees;</li>
<li>Blore perjured himself in the trial of a bank robber named James Landor who later died in prison;</li>
<li>Lombard abandoned a party of 21 native retainers to die in the African bush;</li>
<li>Vera Claythorne purposefully let a small boy in her care named Cyril Hamilton swim out to sea and drown, but was cleared by a coroner's inquest.</li>
</ul>
<p>The characters realize they've all been tricked into coming to the island, but now have no way to get back to the mainland. Within moments, Anthony Marston dies from cyanide in his drink. (Verse #1):</p>
<p><br />
<i>Ten little Indian boys went out to dine;</i><br />
<i>One choked his little self, then there were nine.</i></p>
<p>Next morning, Mrs. Rogers never wakes up and is assumed to have received a fatal overdose of sleeping drugs. (Verse # 2):</p>
<p><br />
<i>Nine little Indian boys sat up very late;</i><br />
<i>One overslept himself and then there were Eight.</i></p>
<ul>
<li>At lunchtime, General MacArthur is found dead from a blow to the back of his head. (Verse # 3):</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
<i>Eight little Indian boys traveling in Devon;</i><br />
<i>One said he'd stay there and then there were Seven.</i></p>
<p>In growing panic, the survivors search the island for the murderer or possible hiding places, but find nothing. They then realize that the murderer must be one of them, and is playing a sadistic game, killing them in a manner paralleling the nursery rhyme, and also removing one of ten little figurines in the dining room after each murder. The survivors have a meeting and discover that none of them has an alibi for any of the deaths.</p>
<p>The next morning Rogers is found dead in the woodshed, having been killed with a large axe. {Verse # 4):</p>
<p><br />
<i>Seven little Indians chopping up sticks;</i><br />
<i>One chopped himself in halves and then there were Six.</i></p>
<p>Later that day, Emily Brent dies from an injection of <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potassium_cyanide.html" title="Potassium cyanide">potassium cyanide</a> – the injection mark on her neck is a parody of a bee sting. {Verse # 5}:</p>
<p><br />
<i>Six little Indians playing with a hive;</i><br />
<i>A bumble bee stung one and then there were Five.</i></p>
<p>The five remaining – Dr. Armstrong, Justice Wargrave, Philip Lombard, Vera Claythorne, and Inspector Blore – become increasingly paranoid. Wargrave announces that anything on the island that could be used as a weapon should be locked up. They lock up Wargrave's sleeping pills and Armstrong's doctor equipment, but Lombard's revolver has gone missing. They spend the afternoon sitting around, watching each other.</p>
<p>Later that evening, Vera goes to her room to take a shower, and feels a clammy hand touch her back. She screams, and the others come running to her aid. They find that someone had dangled seaweed from a hook on her ceiling, apparently trying to scare her to death. After a short period of time, they realize that Wargrave wasn't with them. They return to the sitting room, and find him still sitting in his chair. But now he was fully clothed in his judge attire, with a red mark on his forehead. After a close examination, Dr. Armstrong declares him dead; he was shot through the head. {Verse # 6}:</p>
<p><br />
<i>Five little Indians going in for law;</i><br />
<i>One got into Chancery and then there were Four.</i></p>
<p>That night, Dr. Armstrong leaves the house, and when the other three survivors search for him, all they can find is a smashed window and yet another figurine missing from the table. {Verse # 7}:</p>
<p><br />
<i>Four little Indians going out to sea;</i><br />
<i>A red herring swallowed one and then there were Three.</i></p>
<p>Vera, Inspector Blore, and Lombard think it best to go outside when morning arrives. Blore later returns to the house to get some sustenance, and a dull thud is heard. When Vera and Philip come to see what happened, they find Blore dead, his head crushed by a heavy marble clock. {Verse # 8}:</p>
<p><br />
<i>Three little Indians walking in the Zoo;</i><br />
<i>A big bear hugged one and then there were Two.</i></p>
<p>They, not knowing if Armstrong was dead or alive, assume that he did it and decide to stay out of the house.</p>
<p>The pair then walks along the cliffs to find Armstrong's drowned body. Vera and Lombard then realize that they are the only two left. Even though neither could possibly have murdered the Inspector, the suspicion has driven them to a breaking point and each of them assumes the other to be the murderer.</p>
<p>Vera tricks Lombard into helping her lift Armstrong's body out of reach of the water, and while Lombard is busy, she snatches his revolver. Lombard then reaches for his revolver, only to discover that Vera has pickpocketed it. She shoots him. {Verse # 9}:</p>
<p><br />
<i>Two little Indians sitting in the sun;</i><br />
<i>One got frizzled up and then there was One.</i></p>
<p>Vera then returns to the house, thinking she is finally safe. When Vera gets to her room, she discovers a noose (rope) hanging there, with a chair under it. Having finally been driven mad by the entire experience – along with terrible feelings of guilt for her actions – she breaks down and hangs herself in the room, thus fulfilling the final verse of the rhyme:</p>
<p><br />
<i>One little Indian boy left all alone;</i><br />
<i>he went and hanged himself, and then there were none</i>.</p>

<p>The epilogue to the novel consists of a conversation between two police detectives concerning the unsolved mystery. They have concluded from the physical evidence and various characters' diaries and journal entries that Blore, Armstrong, Lombard and Claythorne were definitely the last to die, thus one of them must have been the killer. However, Blore could not have died last, as the clock was definitely dropped onto him from above, and it would've been impossible for him to have the bear fall on him. Armstrong could not have: his drowned body was dragged above the high-tide mark by someone else. Lombard could not have, since he was shot on the beach and the revolver was found upstairs in the doorway of Wargrave's room. That left Vera (whose fingerprints are on the pistol and from whose window was dropped the clock on Blore), who hanged herself from the ceiling... but the chair from which she leapt with the noose around her neck was found pushed against the wall, out of reach from where she might have stood on it. Hence, although one of the guests <i>must</i> have been the killer, none of them <i>could</i> have been. Isaac Morris, the man who made all the arrangements for the island, can't tell them anything: he died of an overdose the day the party set sail. (Oddly the police don't seem to realize the pattern of the island killings is in the rhyme, which is in each victim's room.)</p>
<p>The postscript consists of a letter which solves the mystery. The late Judge Lawrence Wargrave wrote the letter to explain that he had planned the killings because, expained in the letter, ever since he was a child, he had a sadist touch to him, but he was facinated with the legal system. Wargrave first freely divulges his own hunger for blood, combined with his desire for strict justice (he never was able to punish someone whom he honestly thought of as innocent) and his delight in seeing the guilty punished. When a physician told Wargrave he was dying, he decided to go out in a dramatic fashion which would satiate his inner urges, rather than letting his life slowly trickle away.</p>
<p>Thus, he details how he picked his victims, including the drug-dealing Morris, (he mostly heard about the cases in the course of his work, and even met the man whose life was ruined after Vera, his lover, caused the death of his beloved nephew, wanting to make him the inheritor of the boy's fortune) and how he murdered Morris, Marston, Mr. and Mrs. Rogers, Macarthur, and Emily Brent. He then deceived Dr. Armstrong into pronouncing him "dead", thus allowing the two to meet by the cliffs to discuss a strategy for determining the killer's identity. When Armstrong arrived, Wargrave shoved him over the edge, then went back to the house and pretended to be dead. His trick made it possible for him to kill Blore and orchestrate the deaths of Lombard and Vera.</p>
<p>After Vera (the guiltiest of the "condemned" according to the judge, since she deliberately killed an innocent child for his inheritance but managed to pass as a heroine who tried to rescue the boy) hanged herself, Wargrave, who had been watching from the bedroom closet, pushed the chair against the wall. He then wrote out his final message, putting the message in a bottle and casting the bottle into the sea. He states that his only regret is that it was not enough to invent an insoluble mystery – he wishes someone would realize just how clever he has been – therefore he explains three clues which point to him as the killer, in case his letter is not found:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wargrave mentions in the letter that Edward Seton's death was justified because the police knew that he was guilty. Therefore, Wargrave was the only guest who did not murder anyone (that is, before coming to the island).</li>
<li>The "red herring" line in the poem suggests the fact that Armstrong was tricked into his death-and that Wargrave is the only one Armstrong would confide in.</li>
<li>The bullet would leave a red mark in Wargrave's forehead similar to the mark of Cain, the first murderer in the Old Testament.</li>
</ol>
<p>The conclusion of the judge's letter indicates that he planned to shoot himself whilst sitting on his bed, so that his body would fall onto the bed as if it had been laid there. He fastened the gun to the doorknob with a piece of elastic cord in such a way that the recoil would snap the gun out into the hallway as the door to his room closed. Thus the police found ten dead bodies and an unsolvable mystery on Indian Island.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The novel was originally published in Britain under the title "Ten Little <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">Niggers</a>" in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a>.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> All references to "Indian" in the story were originally "Nigger": thus the island was called "Nigger Island" rather than "Indian Island" and the poem found by each murder victim was also called "Ten Little Niggers" rather than "Ten Little Indians".</p>
<p>The novel was serialized in the <a href="../../../s/a/t/Saturday_Evening_Post_2355.html" title="Saturday Evening Post">Saturday Evening Post</a> in 1939, using the title "And Then There Were None."</p>
<p>For the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> edition of <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a> the title was changed to the less inflammatory "And Then There Were None". In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a> the title of the British edition was changed to "Ten Little Indians", which was also the name given to several motion pictures based on the novel. Today "And Then There Were None" is the title used in nearly all English-language editions although in the 2003 Harper Collins edition the name of the island is changed to Soldiers Island and the nursery rhyme is changed to Ten Little Soldiers. However the original title survives in many foreign-language versions of the novel: for example the French translation has the title <i>Dix petits nègres</i><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> and the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a> Russian film adaptation has the title <i>Desyat Negrityat</i>.</p>

<p>In 1943, Agatha Christie adapted the story for the stage. In the process of doing so, she realized that the novel's grim conclusion would not work dramatically on stage, so she reworked the ending for Lombard and Vera to be innocent of the crimes they were accused of, survive, and fall in love.

<p>The themes and motifs found in "And Then There Were None" can be found in abundance in more recent stories in popular culture – such as <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slasher_film.html" title="Slasher film">slasher films</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horror_film.html" title="Horror film">horror films</a>, and <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disaster_film.html" title="Disaster film">disaster films</a> — in which the characters die off one by one. Films of those genres often employ a similar structure in order to both provide episodic gory scenes which build tension towards a conclusion in which the main character confronts the villain alone. This main character in slasher films is often referred to as the "<a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_girl.html" title="Final girl">final girl</a>" and shares many similarities with the doomed Vera Claythorne, the final victim in Christie's novel.</p>
