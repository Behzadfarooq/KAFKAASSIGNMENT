<p>Hi. I just installed <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyZ_monobook.js_footnotehelper.js_813f.html" title="User:AndyZ/monobook.js/footnotehelper.js">User:AndyZ/monobook.js/footnotehelper.js</a>, and it's not displaying correctly for me. The creator itself has a form that spills off the background rectangle, making some of the field labels hard to read (against the text being edited). The popups are also too small, and some text gets cut off. In the former case, it might help to specify width and height in ems rather than percent of window size; in the latter, specifying horizontal scroll bars if necessary might be a good idea. <sub><s>Seahen</s></sub><a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeonMerlin_5f2b.html" title="User:NeonMerlin"><span style="background-color:#000000;color:#ff0000">Neon</span></a><a href="../../../n/e/o/User_talk%7ENeonMerlin_f87e.html" title="User talk:NeonMerlin"><span style="background-color:#00ff00;color:#000000">Merlin</span></a> 16:19, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Andy, I've seen your tool check for featured articles, but I have no idea how to use javascript. I've read the instructions, but they're still Greek to me. Would you be able to install it for me (on my talk page&#160;? is that how it works), or would you be able to run it on the article <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tourette_syndrome.html" title="Tourette syndrome">Tourette syndrome</a>, and put the results on the TS talk page, or on my talk page? I apologize if this is a stupid request, since it really is Greek to me. It seems like an immensely useful tool&#160;!

<p>Hey AndyZ! I wanted to say thanks again for your support vote in the FAC for <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alison_Krauss_c476.html" title="Alison Krauss">Alison Krauss</a>.

<p>Hey Andy, I was using your peerreviewer tool on my article <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregorian_chant.html" title="Gregorian chant">Gregorian chant</a>, and found that it was giving the "headingthe" message (indicating the word "The" at the beginning of a section header) even though none of the headers started with "The."

<ul>
<li>Proper chants of the Mass</li>
<li>Ordinary chants of the Mass</li>
<li>Twentieth century</li>
</ul>
<p>At first, I thought the word "the" in the middle might be the culprit, but that doesn't explain why "Twentieth century" would be an issue. Besides, the heading "Chants of the Office" <i>doesn't</i> trigger that message. I couldn't figure out what the problem was, and nothing I tried (including removing the word "the" and replacing "twentieth" with "20th") fixed the problem. You don't need to fix it on my account; if anyone at the FAC review questions it, I'll just point out that the headers are in compliance. But I thought you might want to know about the glitch just to help fine-tune the javascript. <a href="../../../p/e/i/User%7EPeirigill_aec5.html" title="User:Peirigill">Peirigill</a> 21:57, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're not getting that message? How strange. I wonder if it's something I'm doing wrong, or if it's something about my computer? It's disconcerting to think the tool doesn't work properly on my machine, since that means I can't trust the other messages (or trust that the absence of a message means there's no problem). <a href="../../../p/e/i/User%7EPeirigill_aec5.html" title="User:Peirigill">Peirigill</a> 22:29, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey Andy, I've been back around PR recently, and found your tool incredibly helpful with articles. Since I'm not perfect and picking out every error, (who is?) I was wondering if there was a way for the tool to assess articles that aren't at PR? I am the main (only) contributor to <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torchic.html" title="Torchic">Torchic</a>, which received FA status in June, and I've kept improving it afterwards, but I wanted to run the article through the tool without having to put it on PR. If you could reply soonish, I'm away but I'll check my messages when it's possible, that would be great.

<p>Hi Andy</p>
<p>Some of the points in your "show/hide" sections, particularly "dates and numbers" and "images", go to a second line on my monitor (a wide-screen mac). The lower half of these second lines is almost obliterated—there's not enough vertical space for it to be displayed properly. Is is possible to fix this? <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony1_9951.html" title="User:Tony1">Tony</a> 01:35, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I notice that I didn't specify that it's the bolded initial display text that has this problem, not the explanatory text that displays on hitting "Show", which is fine. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony1_9951.html" title="User:Tony1">Tony</a> 01:42, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>When I copied your idea for my own tutorial page, I found the same problem and shortened the lead-in exercises. That was a little tedious, though. I wonder whether any of the techs have a suggestion, because it's a mighty useful format. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony1_9951.html" title="User:Tony1">Tony</a> 00:06, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I personally think your automated peer review script is starting to get a bit annoying. It might be useful for <i>some</i> people, but I *really* prefer a peer review where the peer <i>reviewer</i> has actually <b>read</b> the article instead of an automated list of things that don't apply. The peer review I'm talking about, <a href="../../../x/e/r/Xerox.html" title="Xerox">Xerox</a>, you only gave me stuff about formatting, not actual context. The lead is suffice, it may need a copy-edit, and references are coming as I said in my peer review description, I wanted context feedback. You should consider manually peer reviewing articles again, because your script isn't all that useful. — <a href="../../../w/a/c/User%7EWackymacs_1999.html" title="User:Wackymacs">Wackymacs</a> 07:07, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I understand. For most people your automated script is actually useful, but I like lots of context feedback. Right now there are management problems at the peer review, because its simply getting flooded with entries, and there aren't enough people doing peer reviews.

<p>Why are you (or at least your bot) recommending that the category tags be sorted? This was discussed at Wikipedia talk:Categorization/Archive 13#Recommended order for Category links and at the Village Pump (discussion not archived) with the result that there is no consensus for doing this and some people believe it is destructive. Please stop recommending this practice. --<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffW_9f12.html" title="User:JeffW">JeffW</a> 15:58, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The image that's at the top right corner needs to be updated. The images are updated/changed every so often on the Harry Potter character articles. Since there are no other images for Snape that can be put up in the right hand corner, I think another one should be uploaded.

<p>Hi Andy</p>
<p>Do you remember the issue of longer sentences doubling back and being half obliterated on you suggestions page? I had the same problem with my 2a page, for which I stole your idea of show/hide. In addition, Ambuj has pointed out that on slower servers, this function displays the hidden text at first.</p>
<p>Hey presto, the way to avoid both of these problems is at hand, thanks to Ambuj. He has inserted the right code into my 2a page, so I thought you might be interested in using it on your page too.</p>

<p>I wanted to thank you very much for your semi-automated suggestions for <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larrys_Creek_d008.html" title="Larrys Creek">Larrys Creek</a> - I believe I have addressed each of the concerns raised. I wrote a brief summary on the Peer review page of what I was doing as I addressed each concern, then did strikethrough on most of these when I was done. My concern now is that no one (except me) has commented on the article since your initial comment of July 14. Should I not have made my comments? Do people see those and think it has already been reviewed? I am not asking you to peer review it (again), but I just wondered if there was anything I have done wrong or could do differently to attract some reviewers. This is my first time through the peer review process and I fear I have somehow screwed it up.

<dd>Thanks very much for your kind reply and for reviewing Larrys Creek (I was not trying to make more work for you). I appreciate both very much and will make the suggested changes next. Part of why I was frustrated was that I had asked some people I have collaborated with to look at the article for Peer Review and joined Wikiproject:Rivers and asked there for review as well (all to no avail as yet).</dd>

<dd>Would it make any sense to strongly suggest that people who submit articles for peer review also take a look at two or three other articles and review them or at least leave comments?

<p>I've just read your automated <a href="../../../p/e/e/Wikipedia%7EPeer_review_Automated_e97b.html#Heysel_Stadium_disaster" title="Wikipedia:Peer review/Automated">peer review of Heysel Stadium disaster</a>. Although I don't take great issue with it I would like to point out that when it says: <i>the footnote should be located right after the punctuation mark, such that there is no space inbetween. For example, change blah blah [2]. to blah blah.[2]</i> It sounds very cut and dried, very definite. Whereas the article linked says this style "not mandatory". Infact that is the opposite of how references are cited in scientific papers. Putting the citation within the punctuation removes any ambiguity, having it after punctuation allows a lay reader to misinterpret what it is refering to.</p>
<p>When I first had this argument a month or so back I used the featured article of the day to prove my point. It was <a href="../../../m/a/u/Mauthausen-Gusen_concentration_camp_90eb.html" title="Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp">Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp</a>, and its citations were in the style that I prefer, so what do we do? It's interesting to note that now someone has changed the style for the lead section, but the body of the article still uses the British style... weird. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlii_h_fb96.html" title="User:Alii h">aLii</a> 10:06, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

Actually I do have an idea that might help to improve quality, but I want to refine some points with the help of someone more knowledgeable on technical details and an ability to program it (my programming ability is very basic).</p>
<p>Currently, making a reference in a wikipedia article is a painstacking procedure (without tools). On the other hand direct references seem the best way to determine quality of articles.</p>
<p>My idea is to create a (seperate) formula for filling in references at the current cursor position in the edited text when given the command. The automatic formula does list all positions possible (or considered possible, etc.) to fill in for a reference. Furthermore it needs an archiving function and it should have the possibility to recall easily from a selection of former references for minor changes like page numbers. Considering the multiple possibilities to integrate such a tool (popup, page integrated, bot, etc.), your experience could be helpful. Such a tool needs distribution and a a simple explanation of how to operate this easily without being a computerfreak. Actually I wrote this before knowing of your system, but some components seem not to be integrated. (I still didn't figure out how to operate it. Could you write a simple explanation for everybody?).

<p>I'm new so I don't understand this, sorry. Many pages I am looking at in Wikipedia: Peer Review have a link to automated suggestions done by your semi-bot.

<p>If you are intending everyone to read it, Is there a way I can make that page look like English so I can tell if your semi-bot is already making the suggestions I might be making?

<p>Mario Strikers Charged is a game under development. So, it could have speculated characters, right? I keep adding them, while the other guy keeps erasing it, saying that they are CONFIRMED.

<p>Hi AndyZ, I was doing Semi Automated Peer Review while you were on a wikibreak. I just saw you did one, so I will let you do them (if you want to). It was very helpful when I had a peer review, so I wanted to help others. Thanks and take care, <a href="../../../r/u/h/User%7ERuhrfisch_d1a4.html" title="User:Ruhrfisch">Ruhrfisch</a> 02:48, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>You are very welcome - I really appreciate the semi automated peer review you ran on my one article that has been through the process (as well as your real human peer review comments). I think it is helpful because there are lots of little details most editors are unaware of that the script catches and makes them aware of. So I now put a non-breaking space between numbers and units as a matter of course, but learned that (and alphabetizing cats, etc.) via PR/A. There are times when I really like doing semi-mindless repetitive wiki tasks, so do let me know if I can help out again. Take care and keep up the good work, <a href="../../../r/u/h/User%7ERuhrfisch_d1a4.html" title="User:Ruhrfisch">Ruhrfisch</a> 02:29, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi Andy. You were very helpful with this article's <a href="../../../p/e/e/Wikipedia%7EPeer_review_BAE_Systems_300c.html" title="Wikipedia:Peer review/BAE Systems">peer review</a>. It has since crashed and burned through a <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_candidates_BAE_Systems_230c.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/BAE Systems">FAC</a>. However both have these have led to significant improvements. Could you suggest the best next step, another peer review pointing out the improvements made?

<dd>Thank you very much. I see you said you would look into the article further. If you would prefer I'll work on your excellent suggestions and then let you know? Thanks again, <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark83_60bf.html" title="User:Mark83">Mark83</a> 23:38, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As promised I've worked on your suggestions. Any other pointers would be very welcome. I'm not 100% clear on the requirements for the naming of the reference/note section. I've looked at a few FAs and there is not great consistency. Thanks again, <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark83_60bf.html" title="User:Mark83">Mark83</a> 22:36, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've had a look over the FAC. I think all of the objections have been adressed:
<ul>
<li>Lists — Dramatic difference between this version (pre-FAC) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=BAE_Systems&amp;diff=66184353&amp;oldid=66164786" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=BAE_Systems&amp;diff=66184353&amp;oldid=66164786" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and the current version. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=BAE_Systems&amp;diff=84134624&amp;oldid=84133862" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=BAE_Systems&amp;diff=84134624&amp;oldid=84133862" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></li>
<li>History section too short and only one subsection — Fixed.</li>
<li>"Odd edit link" — I'm assuming that has been fixed, I haven't noticed one.</li>
<li>"Refs do not use cite php format" — Fixed</li>
<li>Quotes should not be in italics — Fixed</li>
<li>Reorganisation suggestions followed.</li>
<li>Criticism too short — It could do with more, but I have expanded it a lot since the FAC. Pre-FAC <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=BAE_Systems&amp;diff=66184353&amp;oldid=66164786" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=BAE_Systems&amp;diff=66184353&amp;oldid=66164786" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=BAE_Systems&amp;diff=66184353&amp;oldid=66164786</a> and the current version <a href="../../../b/a/e/BAE_Systems_bab3.html#Criticisms" title="BAE Systems">BAE Systems#Criticisms</a></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I'm not proposing to rush into a FAC right away. I know there are still improvements to be made. However it has come a long way since August. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark83_60bf.html" title="User:Mark83">Mark83</a> 22:55, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was just looking at some of the summaries done by your semi-bot on peer review (and incidentally was quite impressed by them), and saw that for a few articles (such as <a href="../../../%C3%B3/e/n/%C3%93engus_I_of_the_Picts_9db5.html" title="Óengus I of the Picts">Óengus I of the Picts</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/t/Integrated_Guided_Missile_Development_Program_5041.html" title="Integrated Guided Missile Development Program">Integrated Guided Missile Development Program</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/e/Gaetano_Bedini_fb30.html" title="Gaetano Bedini">Gaetano Bedini</a>...) it was incorrectly saying that they had no images. I didn't know if you were aware of this bug (my apologies if it's come up already) so just wanted to mention it. Thanks. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 19:41, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
