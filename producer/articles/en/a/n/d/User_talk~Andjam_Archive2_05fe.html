<p>I'm not really sure what should be done, as it's a pseudonym, not a real name. The real SoCalJustice could simply edit under a different name, I suppose, if he wanted to. I'm not sure how he'd prove he was the "real" SoCalJustice either. Also, I don't think these things are ever done on behalf of other editors, or "just in case". <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 05:18, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've been the victim of an autoblock, but I'm not at the IP affected by the autoblock.</p>
<p>It says that I've got an IP of 66.230.200.195 , but my IP doesn't even start with the same number. The admin is Sango123, and the reasoning is "Autoblocked because your IP address has been recently used by "067970327". The reason given for 067970327's block is: "user..."."</p>
<p>It's after midnight, so I should get to bed, and hopefully this'll clear up without having to be unblocked. I'd rather not be unblocked, because that means that I've been blocked in the first place, if that makes sense ... <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndjam_08d6.html" title="User:Andjam">Andjam</a> 14:24, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>same happened to me, and many others. My IP is in the 86.128.0.0 - 86.135.255.255 range (BT in the UK, as are most/all of the ones I've seen affected; all were seeing 66.x.x.x has been autoblocked); it looks like something somewhere blocked the wrong range, or something.

<dd>Yup, and all the people I've talked to have seen a 66.x.x.x address instead of their own. I guess the fact you sucessfully put a post on my talkpage shows that you've been unblocked, along with the rest of us! Put it down to the Wiki having a brainfart, I reckon. I'd go and sleep on it, if I were you.

<p>Hey, i see what you mean now. Well-spotted. I thought you were trying to compare the passages that you posted on the Discussion page (ie, 1 from Wikipedia, the other from AFP, but now I realise they are both from wikip). What to do? My view is, it has to be fixed. I did little bit of editing, and clarified some References and Notes. I am fearful a wiki nazi will come a slap a copy vio tag on the article which means no more editing til it is resolve. But there is very little in the AFP article that is not common knowledge and/or cannot be sourced from other places so i think that is pointless. I don't have the time right now to fix it all up. Thus i suggest one of two things. You (ha ha) work through the issues and find other sources, paraphrase or reference AFP at specific points, OR, just chop out the AFP sections and let others rebuild it. I can help out in a few days. Once again, well-spotted and sorry i didn't catch on to your point earlier. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 02:55, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would rather in most cases have had the comment on my talk page however, it was a fair comment and I will respond in kind.</p>
<p>I did not feel I was "poisoning the well" in portraying the difference between this discussion and the previous unanimous discussion as based on personal opinions. References to "cruft" in any sense of the word show that at least some personal subjective opinion is in the discussion.</p>
<p>The blatant use of policy acronyms without referencing why the page fails them, such as the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> page which is a collection of independent policies. They also did not reference why something can actually "fail" a notability guideline, as they are not meant to be exhaustive criteria. The page fulfils what I expected to be on the guideline, even if it is not there already, ie, that it has been screened on national television and has had commentary on it.</p>
<p>I feel that claims to "notability" are more poisonous than pointing out a lack of objective basis behind these claims. "delete per nom" on an obviously complex issue makes it look like AfD has been reduced to a vote, not a discussion see <a href="../../../d/d/v/WP%7EDDV_84f5.html" title="WP:DDV">WP:DDV</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 02:40, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>In general, the content of the article is alright, but the organization and layout/format of it is messy, there are a lot of redlinks, few headings and no pictures. Plus, I'm sure there's room for the article content itself to be expanded. Normally, I'd be happy to do so myself, but I don't know anything about the topic beyond what is already there... perhaps instead of {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup_258a.html" title="Template:Cleanup">cleanup</a>}} I could have used {{<a href="../../../w/i/k/Template%7EWikify_3cf0.html" title="Template:Wikify">wikify</a>}}, as it is primarily a MoS issue...

<p>I believe the use of the image qualifies as fair use. The photograph taken is from a pro-Palestinian activist group, and thus I would imagine they encourage the use of their work to either to promote their political activism or to create awareness of the Palestine situation.</p>

<p>You have made two unsolicited negative, and in my view, redundant posts on my talk page recently. Please see my general comments in response on the Howard talk page which is where I feel you should have responded to anything I have written rather than making what at first blush could be interpreted as threats of some kind. You don't seem to be an Admin - if you want to be one apply for it. I'll probably vote for you.</p>

<dd>Why did you rem the words <i>but did not serve in either the permanent or part time reserve military forces at this time despite being of military age.</i>? It remains a fact that Howard did not join the military forces when he was of military age. You will note that I did not say that he "did not try". I said that he just didn't. That is a fact. I can't see how this vios the BLP policy.

<dd>I have put in a wording which you may or many not like about the enlistment issue. I just wish you would stop stonewalling on this issue. As with his support of the Vietnam war these things are actually documented - sometime in the newspapers of the time etc, sometimes in his own speak. There are some new biographies coming out I believe - perhaps they will touch on these matter unlike Barnett's panygeric which does not go there. I can't see where I could be considered to have been defamatory. Please explicate your concerns. I am happy to be guided by you. Please email me if you wish to rather than carry on a conversation by Talk Edits. I can send you my phone no if you request it and you can call me if this is more practical from your view point.

<dd>You wrote: <i>Everything that is in a wikipedia article should be supported by a reference to a reliable source.

There is indeed a statement there to the effect that the sun does rise in the east. It is uncited! More work for you there I am afraid. On a more serious note how can I cite that there is a source for the statement that neither Howard and his biographers have never claimed that he tried to enlist? That is impossible to cite and but it is of biographical interest to mention his failure to enlist, I would argue, since Howard seeks to emphasise his empathy for the military and he frequently mentions his family history of war service. 12:06, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi again. As you may be aware the award citations and other info on VC winners has been transferred across to Wikipedia as the project was getting too much for the chap who had set up a site for the purpose BW. One of the aims of the VC project was to document the current location of the medals. In the case of <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norman_Douglas_Holbrook_979c.html" title="Norman Douglas Holbrook">Lt Holbrook</a> his medal was donated some time to the now defunct Holbrook Shire Council. There was some concern that the medal may have gone astray during the LGA amalgamation and it was felt that an attempt should be made to locate and document its whereabouts. There was no information on the successor LGA's website, so I wrote to the GM there to get the information and subsequently put it in the article. Now this is "original research" and not independently verifiable as such but it is practical as this sort of information is for various reasons unlikely to be properly publicly documented anywhere else. I would be interested in your thoughts on this. (I mean this seriously) Cheers <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbatross2147_b76b.html" title="User:Albatross2147">Albatross2147</a> 00:07, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Andjam, In order to "prove" who was an editor, all you need are old copies of the newspaper I would imagine, so I can't see how the non citation issue applies here.</p>
<p>I added a lot of these in over period because many of them are notables, for example John Paul Byrne is a published playwright, Trish Pender a published poet and author, Gabby Milgate an actor in Muriel's Wedding and a radio breakfast host, Julia Leigh is a prize winning Author, Anthony Sharwood a senior writer for Alpha magazine, Michael Fullilove is Program Director for Global Issues at the Lowy institute and so on.</p>
<p>Sould I also suggest that it's also a bit insulting to these people to describe them as "non notable people" on the world wide web? Working as an adviser to the Prime Miniter (Michael Fullilove) or appearing on the news singing your hit single (Kylie Burtland) is what I'd call notable.</p>
<p>As you'd imagine it will take a bit of time to cite of all these, but I included them because someone pointed out we needed more history. I don't care either way but I did put a bit of work into the research so... <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_203.9.151.30_83b9.html" title="Special:Contributions/203.9.151.30">203.9.151.30</a> (<a href="../../../2/0/3/User_talk%7E203.9.151.30.html" title="User talk:203.9.151.30">talk</a>) 02:23, 8 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>I made an error, though it's hard to admit it to those who are after my throat. However, the MFD just got closed as to merge, yet only five people wanted that, and I can assure you that more than 5 people wanted it kept as is! - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 12:31, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
