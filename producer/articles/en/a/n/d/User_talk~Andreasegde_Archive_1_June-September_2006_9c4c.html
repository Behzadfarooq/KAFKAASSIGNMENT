<p>I just want to preface this by saying that I mean no offense whatsoever when I ask you these questions.</p>
<p>Is there a technical reason that you use a <a href="../../../b/a/c/Backtick.html" title="Backtick">backtick</a> (`), rather than an <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostrophe.html" title="Apostrophe">apostrophe</a> (')? I mean, I don't know where you're from, so maybe it's a keyboard issue, but it just drives me nuts. I can't help it. It just bothers me. I don't suppose there's any chance you'll change your writing habits?

<dd>Wow, I really have to shut up today. I just realized that you don't use a backtick. You use something else.

<p><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hella" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:hella">Hella</a> is a slang term which came out of Northern California and has become one of those litmus-test words which identifies someone who uses it (genuinely) as a Northern Californian. It basically means "a lot" or "very much". Very, very many people in the Bay Area use it at least occasionally. The joke is just a play on its popularity in this area. <a href="../../../e/a/e/User%7EEaefremov_7b22.html" title="User:Eaefremov">eae</a> 03:08, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you wish to improve this article, you could change the "Miscellany" section to a section regarding McCartney's legacy. Add an intro, convert the listy stuff into prose and tie it all cohesively together into flowing paragraphs, then place unsuitable info elsewhere - this'd help the article. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuciferMorgan_f0d2.html" title="User:LuciferMorgan">LuciferMorgan</a> 18:36, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Also, (to satisfy comprehensiveness) there should be a subsection in this part discussing Paul McCartney's musical influence, ie. who he has influenced, how he has influenced them etc. As ever, inline citations will be required. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuciferMorgan_f0d2.html" title="User:LuciferMorgan">LuciferMorgan</a> 18:56, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

His repetitive clashes with other editors are well documented.

<p>This is counter productive behavior by Gamaliel under any interpretation of Wikipedia policy. Unfortunately, Gamaliel is also an administrator which seems to embolden him.</p>
<p>What is worrisome is that his counterproductive behavior as an editor must reflect his decision making abilities as administrator.</p>
<p>He now doesn't even view himself as an editor but, rather, a <i>source</i> of important opinions.</p>
<p>But, Gamaliel is wrong. He needs to be published by a reliable source to be considered a reliable reference for his particular viewpoint on any given subject. Gamaliel also has to recognize that he can't simply decide he doesn't agree with certain information and therefore delete it from the reference work.</p>

<p>Alright Pal? I've read the discusion page but because of all the terminology, I don't fully understand what's happened. Cheers, <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVera%2C_Chuck_%26_Dave_abb3.html" title="User:Vera, Chuck &amp; Dave">Vera, Chuck &amp; Dave</a> 14:44, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you, LessHeard vanU.</dd>

<dd>Reply to Vera, Chuck &amp; Dave. (The former 'collaboration of the week' duo...)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>No, I'm effin' well cheesed off. The main aim (as you know) was to get the article a better rating than a B (B article). A GA (Good article) would have been great, and then it could have been improved and polished, with a view to getting an FA (Featured article). Unfortunately, the ‘big guns’ came in and wanted to push it for an FA, which it definitely wasn't ready for.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The problem stems from a point that I made which was this: Should the article be chronological? I was told that it should be "thematic", which I disagreed with. (Moving the meeting of Macca and Linda after the Liverpool Institute 'LIPA' section, is thematic, but not chronological. It's not even logical, to silly old me&#160;:)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I was even told that “it was a right old mess before”, and I “should be grateful” for someone helping me. As no comments were posted stating that before, it pissed me well and truly off.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It has just failed its GA (Good article) review, because "<i>there has been some ‘heavy editing’ recently, and there are too many 'expand', and 'This is a stub' comments”.</i> No surprise there. Take a look at it now... It looks like a 'Start' article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anybody that knows me knows that I don't like arguments, so I will take a break, and ponder awhile.... --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasegde_c4ec.html" title="User:Andreasegde">andreasegde</a> 14:33, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>May I suggest that you remove Macca from your watch list, take a deep breath, and find another article to enjoy? Refresh yourself with the delights of another subject.

<dd>I put a lot of time into the Macca article (even giving up a week's holiday) so I am in two minds about this (to ponder is a nice phrase).

<p>Brutus was very fond of "chocolate Christians", a popular Roman sweet. One day he noticed that someone had stolen - and likely eaten - three of his chocolates. In a rage he set off to the senate. On the way he encountered Julius Caesar, laying dying of stab wounds. Seeing the expression on Brutus' face the stricken emperor said, "<i>Et tu, Brutus?</i>". In a rage Brutus pulled out his dagger, crying, "Et Tu? You ate three! Die!!"

<ul>
<li>Vera, Chuck, and Dave <i>must</i> be back on board, because he's great to work with and personally I need his help, and advice.</li>
<li>Kingboyk must also come back because of the above.</li>
<li>Prove to <i>everybody</i> on Wikipedia that it is possible for three (or more) editors to work together on one article. Now - that's a challenge. Are you up for it?</li>
<li>Finish the bloody article, and then we can decide what to do. "<i>Don't leave a job half-finished</i>."</li>

<p>We all have some stylistic questions (who doesn't?) but those can be resolved on the talk page - <i>and I really mean resolved</i>...</p>

I'm off me face on pain killers, but I'll still try to help where I can - these tablets are dead strange, when they kick in I either giggle like a big girl or cry like a baby, weird eh? Nice to see that <i>the guvnor</i> is back on the go! Yews two are making a dead good job of the Macca article.

Check <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron_Maiden_6b08.html" title="Iron Maiden">Iron Maiden</a>'s "Notes" and "References" - this is how it should be done.

<p>I put them in (sorry) but I recently started to put page numbers in on Jane Asher after Kingboyk told me about it. I've been ill this week so I haven't been able to work on them a lot. I'll get back to it today, or tomorrow. If we put them all in, it will definitely be over the 300 mark.

<dd>That's fine, I don't mind at all so there isn't any need to apologise. I'm just highlighting a possible reason for objection which may arise at FAC - we remove the problem, and therefore remove a possible reason for editors objecting to it recieving FA. Anyway, take your time. We're not on a schedule or anything! If you go overboard you might wear yourself out - keep enjoying it, and never let it become a chore. I'm hoping once we (well more like you and Kingboyk) get this to FA, we can look at John Lennon's article. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuciferMorgan_f0d2.html" title="User:LuciferMorgan">LuciferMorgan</a> 15:57, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I like the use of the word "we" - it is to be recommended. We now have LuciferMorgan, Very Chuck and Dave, Kingboyk and andreasegde working on this. We're all in it together. I'll get onto those pages, but it's bloody hard to keep the page open and type at the same time! I still enjoy doing it though, because I've (at last) worked out how to do it...

<p>I think you may need to look at the comment re Epsteins homosexuality - it appears to say that it was Eppys access to late night drinking clubs and his support for the band which negated any negativity toward his sexuality. Does the source indicate that Macca appreciated Eppys access to late night drinking clubs and his support for the band, <b>and</b> the fact that Eppy was gay did not matter to Macca? <a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 21:56, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, that's what he said. I didn't want to put too much in, but I could explain it a bit more, such as them knowing Epstein was "queer", but not caring about it too much.

<dd>As it is a sensitive area I would suggest quoting directly from the source, with references, so negating any criticism of the article.<a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 22:35, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It was from McCartney's own words, and from Barry Miles's book, which was written with the full co-operation of McCartney. I quoted/paraphrased/referenced it exactly as was said. I see no reason (in this day and age) why it should be a sensitive area. (I noticed that it was mentioned (in passing) on Epstein's page, which I thought was 'queer', if you'll pardon the expression.&#160;:) --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasegde_c4ec.html" title="User:Andreasegde">andreasegde</a> 04:07, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fixed it. Although... I believe it is an important part of The Beatles story, because Epstein was attracted to Lennon, as has been often noted. It is an interesting side of their story that often gets overlooked. If it's really a sore point, I'll take it out. (Kingboyk has a good point when he says we have to do a critique of McCartney, as nobody will accept him as being an angel.) --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasegde_c4ec.html" title="User:Andreasegde">andreasegde</a> 05:14, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Alright Mr. Hornby? I'd laugh mate, but it would friggin kill me! I'm really quite bad at the moment I've never bin injured this bad before and am finding it hard to cope with you know what with the drugs and that - really heavy duty stuff not able to sleep much, wide awake and in pain the second they wear off. I see you got the full treatment from Pops, I told her to thank you, Ihope you were,nt embarrassed She's very sweet and they both think your'e dead funny, they're both still telling your chicken joke, in perfect unison to everyone they meet and they both still laugh after telling it! They have both taken to mothering me, they don't really understand whats happened really which is a good thing really.</p>
<p>They have both taken to sleeping with me and my Wife, I have one on the right, one on the left and their Mother ends up on the floor most nights, they're getting quite big now, they'll both be 10 on saturday, but what can you do, except thank God for em?</p>

<p>Oh, before <i>Wingspan</i> goes back, there's a great Macca quote on Page 9 that I think you'll like or may be able to incorperate, here there or anywhere appertaining to The Fabs as follows: "The Beatles had a meeting to sign a new deal with Capitol Records. We were sitting around in this rather tense atmosphere and I was saying, I think we should go back on the road, go back to our roots. We should just go out and play together. And John looked me in the eye and said, I think you're mad!".

<p>Alright O famous one? Yeah ta, I'm a <i>little</i> better although I'm still on the <i>Gear</i> which helps a great deal, but it sort of makes you dream when your'e awake and you don't dream when your'e sleeping! Now the only pages from <i>Wingspan</i> that are not cited are: "I wrote Give Ireland Back To the Irish.......It'll be banned and of course it was". PAGE 40. Mull Of Kintyre: "I certainly loved Scotland enough.....and wanting to get back there". PAGE.129.</p>
<p>If you spot any more gissa bell and I'll send 'em over. Cheers La. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVera%2C_Chuck_%26_Dave_abb3.html" title="User:Vera, Chuck &amp; Dave">Vera, Chuck &amp; Dave</a> 12:21, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
