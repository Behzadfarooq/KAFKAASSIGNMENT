<p>The AfD for Wikifiddler will determine whether the contents will stay under that title, whether they will be merged to a different article, or whether they will be deleted without merge. Your repeated copying of <i>the entire article</i> to <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Orlowski_20f6.html" title="Andrew Orlowski">Andrew Orlowski</a> before the conclusion of that AfD is an attempt to circumvent the process, and the fact that you are doing so in bad faith, aware that what you do is wrong, is shown by your falsely flagging it each time as a "minor edit" (disputed edits are <i>never</i> minor edits, refusing to use an edit summary, and your failure to note on <i>either</i> talk page that you are copying the entire contents of one article verbatim into the other. Your chutzpah in describing it as "vandalism" when these bad-faith edits of yours are reverted is stupidity. Are you really so very in love with Orlowski that when he rants about Wikipedians who act badly you have to leap to fulfill his prophecy by exhibiting the worst behavior you can calculate? -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 22:53, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd have to say the same to you. You have been stupid enough to blank out and revert the article, even though I have extensively added to the material. Since Orlowski clearly is watching Wikipedia closely (see the material you blanked out, you moron) I hope he's watching this discussion and finding it as amusing as I do. Your repeated attempts to censor this material are laughable. --DannyWilde 23:35, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Now that the article Wikifiddler has been deleted, I am unsure what to do with the material User:DannyWilde keeps inserting, i.e. a verbatim copy of Wikifiddler.

<dd>Well, at the risk of sounding snarky, I'd see a problem deciding what to do with the material Wilde kept unilaterally merging, if there had been a consensus that the material <i>should</i> be merged, instead of deleted.

<p>"generally hostile"? Are you sure? I just read the article, and while it didn't exactly paint Wikipedia in glowing terms it isn't what I'd consider outright hostile by any means. Sarcastic, definitely. (There's a difference.)</p>
<p>Why is Jimmy Wales' description of Andrew Orlowski as a "professional troll" notable? I happen to think Cindy Crawford is a moron but you won't find my quote on the subject there. (Hey, maybe I should go add it.) I strongly doubt Jimmy Wales is the best person to judge the situation.</p>

<dd>i've replaced 'generally hostile' with 'critical', which is true, and neutral. wikipedia has some rather huge defects. merely pointing them out could i suppose be characterized as 'out to get' wikipedia. however, his criticisms strike me as extremely useful in pointing out that which wikipedians are often blind to. take the criticism, learn from it, and change. <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnastrophe-wikipedia_d908.html" title="User:Anastrophe-wikipedia">Anastrophe</a> 18:47, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Every time Orlowski stamps out another "witty" diatribe against Wikipedia, do we need to link it here? Do we do this for any other <s>human shitstain</s>gadfly with a bug up his butt? No, we don't, and although some people might claim that <i>because</i> the target is Wikipedia we need to skew coverage in favor of the critics to prove we're not skewing it in favor of Wikipedia, I think that's clearly poppycock. Orlowski's latest "coup" can be summed up in one sentence: "I can vandalize Wikipedia and make it say false things." That's <i>it</i>. Not even "and despite Wikipedia's claims about how fast vandalism is corrected, my false claims stayed up for X hours." Orlowski apparently even felt the need to tell an outright lie:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The news of the "shooting" even made the venerable London Times, yesterday. The Times noted that after the first Seigenthaler scandal broke, the now "deceased" Jimmy Wales had, as he has so often, promised to tighten up a few nuts and bolts in the "encyclopedia's" editorial processes."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Translation: "The London Times were not in any way fooled by my vandalistic edits which claimed there had been a shooting. However, doesn't it sound much better if I lie and say they were?" The Times article was in fact about how Wikipedia was being hit by waves of coordinated vandal attacks in the wake of the favorable comparison to Britannica. So all Orlowski has proved is that if he's allowed to cherry-pick his facts, he can wrap a meager quantity of them in a blanket of shit and call it an article. Do we need to link it every time he does so? No. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 13:44, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay, Anastrophe. Here's what you said: "your attitude towards orlowski is strongly POV, so it would probably be best if you simply not edit the article." Here's what I replied: "Please tell me where <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> states that editors must be free of any strong POVs towards an article's subject in order to edit it?" The <i>only difference</i> between those that I can see is where you said "probably" and I said "must". What was I supposed to say? Would my response have been okay if I had asked where WP:NPOV says "editors <i>should be</i> free of any strong POVs towards an article's subject"? Or is that, too, a proof of bad faith in your book? Perhaps I would have had to be even more precise in repeating your words back to you; perhaps I should have said "Please tell me where NPOV says 'If an editor's attitude towards the subject is strongly POV, it would probably be best if that editor simply does not edit the article'?"

<dd>Here's a hint. "Assume good faith" doesn't actually mean "leap to the conclusion that there was bad faith even when there is an equally plausible explanation that does not mean bad faith." If you see a <i>huge</i> difference between "<i>it would probably be best if</i> you did not edit the article, because you have a strong POV" and "<i>you should not</i> edit the article, because you have a strong POV", then feel free to explain that difference, and convince us there is one. But when you claim "Feldspar wrote as if there was no huge difference between the two! He <i>must</i> see the utterly huge difference that <i>I</i> see and he must have <i>deliberately chosen</i> to ignore that difference! I will accuse him of deliberate dishonesty because I have chosen to utterly rule out the possibility that he does not see the huge difference that <i>I</i> see!" then yes, you <i>are</i> violating <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 17:08, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I agree, you do seem to have a cognitive disconnect here. Wikipedia is based on open discussion; that's not possible when one person says "Here, this is the way <i>I</i> choose to phrase it, and if you choose any other phrasing, I will loudly declare you guilty without trial of first-degree bad faith. <i>I</i> choose the framing of the debate; <i>you</i> are only allowed to say 'yes' or 'no'." This whole rigamarole is just a red herring, anyways; WP:NPOV contains no recommendations whatsoever that certain editors should be discouraged from editing pages because they have strong POVs. Not phrased as "it would possibly be best" <i>or</i> as "must". -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 18:14, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is Orlowski's criticism of Wikipedia a big part of his "salience", so to speak, or a small part? If it's a big part, we should have a separate section for it. If it's a small part, we don't need to reference every single article he's written on the matter.</p>

<p>I've sent a few mails to Orlowski via The Register's webforms about the concept of fallacy. It seems to me that his problem with Wikipedia hinges on the lack of 'authority' of the contributors. To him, an encyclopedia must be authoritative. Even though argument from authority and appeal to authority are fallacies. The irony is palpable. He puts forth on the fallability of contributors, whilst being incapable of grasping philosophical aspects of truth. I can't deny it annoys me that he's employed as a journalist, but without wishing to sound bitter, ultimately his work isn't widely read, so what harm can he do?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Strong disagreement here. When estimating the probability of truth of a statement, reliance on an expert is completely valid, under the presumptions that the expert has access to more information and has thought about the subject more. Appeal to authority is not inherently falacious, it depends very much on who the authority is and the circumstances of the appeal. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 14:49, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It might be valid in a court of law (and indeed a widely used tactic), however courts aren't about truth they're about rule and government. Science uses peer review to ensure that it doesn't fall foul of fallacy. Because of the human condition people cannot be relied upon to speak the truth, or even remember facts correctly no matter how distinguished they are. My father swears blind that I recieved a scar on my top lip from a cracked dummy. But my mother insists that my tooth came through my lip. Both were present, both are authorities, both differ. Whilst I understand that courts believe argument from authority isn't a fallacy, I can't think of a single instance when witness testimony could be taken as fact with one eye on scientific process.</dd>

<p>The article contained a link to the <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power.html" title="Power">Power</a> disambiguation page. Since that page consists of a list of possibly relevant articles (<a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_%28sociology%29.html" title="Power (sociology)">Power (sociology)</a> or <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economic_power.html" title="Economic power">Economic power</a>) as well as obviously irrelevant articles (such as Electric power) I judged that the link would only distract a reader, and changed from a link to an ordinary word. <a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 14:25, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>No slam on Andrew at all, but it seems doubtful that an article about AO would exist if he were not a vocal critic of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>It is also amazing that, in an article that is around 687 words long, around 284 of them (over a third) concern what AO has said about Wikipedia. Obviously, this is the only part of his work that is of interest to most Wikipedians, but that doesn't mean that it's suitable material for a Wikipedia article. Or is it? Perhaps it is, if the main consumers of Wikipedia articles are supposed to be Wikipedians themselves. But if not, then you might ask unbiased consumers of tech journalism, who are familiar with his work, on what topics he has done his best work--and then write about that. Maybe it's Wikipedia, but no doubt few people working on this article actually have the faintest clue.</p>
<p>I'd like to point out that the <i>Citizendium</i> will almost certainly have a policy against undue self-reference. Wikipedia of course has some language to that effect, but it doesn't enforce it. CZ will enforce its policy and will, thus, be a little less navel-gazing. --<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarry_Sanger_6200.html" title="User:Larry Sanger">Larry Sanger</a> 07:22, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wikipedia already has a guideline along those lines: <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_self-references_3b86.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid self-references">Wikipedia:Avoid self-references</a>. But as I see it the only effect of editor influence from his Wikipedia-related activities in this case is to get an article written about Orlowski <i>earlier</i> than it otherwise would. We have plenty of other articles on journalists already and I hope Wikipedia eventually has articles on all of the prominent ones. It's useful for checking up on what a journalist's areas of expertise and biases are. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 21:08, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Wikipedia of course has some language to that effect, but it doesn't enforce it. CZ will enforce its policy and will, thus, be a little less navel-gazing.</i> It will, hmmm? You guarantee that CZ will do everything right that Wikipedia's doing wrong, hmmm? You really don't think there's any possibility that CZ will, like Wikipedia and I daresay like most projects, have some principles that end up getting neglected in practice, hmmm? Free advice, Larry -- it's generally good advice not to count your chickens before they've hatched. That's <i>especially</i> good advice when you're tempted to say "They should be ashamed of the inferior quality of their chickens; just look at how superior <i>our</i> chickens are ... and by 'are', I mean 'will be, Real Soon Now.'" -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 02:04, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
