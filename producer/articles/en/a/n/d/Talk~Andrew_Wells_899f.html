<p>Another, more controversial aspect of Andrew's character is his overtly <a href="../../../g/e/e/Geek.html" title="Geek">geeky</a> behaviour and attitude. On "Buffy", the character constantly makes geeky references to comic books and <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_fcb0.html" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a></i>. On more than one occasion, Andrew also acts as a sort of sounding board for questions often brought up regarding the show, asking out loud why only girls get to be vampire slayers and making comments about the convoluted nature of <a href="../../../d/a/w/Dawn_Summers_593e.html" title="Dawn Summers">Dawn Summers</a>.</p>
<p>The bulk of the time Andrew is insulted, mocked, and ridiculed by Buffy and her friends for these outburst of geeky behavior (though on at least one occasion <a href="../../../x/a/n/Xander_Harris_f1f1.html" title="Xander Harris">Xander Harris</a> gets caught up in discussing comic books with Andrew), to the point that the character has become a whipping boy for the show's writers to mock nerd culture. Many fans feel highly insulted by this treatment of Andrew, arguing that the treatment of Andrew by the main characters violates one of the core elements of the show, by having the main characters turn into the same sort of elitist bullies that the show regularly criticized during its early seasons. The show's writers make clear, however, that they regard Andrew and his geekiness with great affection, and as a reflection of their own geekiness, in audio commentary on the "Buffy" DVD sets. Some fans laugh off these claims acknowledging that the show is not trying to send a message across about geeks.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the page (Ed Note: I've moved the section to the top of this talk page <a href="../../../x/i/n/User%7EXiner_4ce3.html" title="User:Xiner">Xiner</a> 01:20, 23 February 2006 (UTC)), it talks about how fans were upset with the treatment of Andrew, claiming that Buffy and her friends had transformed into the very people they used to mock. However, I don't see it that way. They mistreated him because he was a former enemy and they still didn't trust him. By the end, they treated him better; he was even training to be a watcher by the time he showed up on <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angel_%28TV_series%29_7f24.html" title="Angel (TV series)">Angel (TV series)</a>. --<a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadaar_1813.html" title="User:Radaar">Radaar</a> 22:21, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree. The First even asked Andrew why he alone needed to prove he had changed, while the likes of Willow were easily welcomed back to the fold. Well, Andrew had no known history of doing good. <a href="../../../x/i/n/User%7EXiner_4ce3.html" title="User:Xiner">Xiner</a> 01:16, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The section “Not bullying” stands to reason at some point and the fans who didn’t like Andrew being put down by the main characters in the Buffy show may still have a point. All the pop culture items that Andrew talked so much about are art, no matter how disregarded they are, but if he had chosen to talk about classical figures of the mythologies from the past –like Greece’s- he would’ve been regarded as boring and stuffy.</p>
<p>Talking can be a complex problem, so using Andrew instead as the comic element was a good idea. I myself stopped watching the show by the 4th season because it had become very dramatic, very different from the fresh (although highly ironic as well) show of the first seasons. But after having my own issues I started appreciating drama and watched the show again. Yet, humor was still necessary; Xander and Willow were still a bit comic, but they simply changed with time after facing so many issues. All in all, the writers did a good job shaping Xander’s and Willow’s personalities over time, and Andrew (at least for me) was a great replacement.</p>
<p>When Andrew explained the general public the general situation of the 7th season in “Storyteller”, people could either see him as pathetic or funny and real. He simply expressed himself like a normal teenager (or anybody in fact) speaks in public, doubtful, hesitating, mumbling, still funny without mocking at anyone else as most comedians do, at least since the times of Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra 4 centuries ago. Yes, his innocence or naivety was funny.</p>
<p>PS: Yes, Andrew and Jonathan did sleep together in Mexico, no sex explicit, but slightly implicit when he smiles he sees Jonathan jumping from the bed. Regardless what he actually was, Andrew was one of my favorite characters (above Buffy)User:quin 07:00, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Talk%7EAndrew_Wells_899f.html" title="Edit section: Homosexuality">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Homosexuality</span></h2>
<p>I watched every episode of the show, and I must admit I did not find Andrew gay at all. Okay, he was feminine, but there are such men who are nevertheless heterosexual. I thought Warren simply took advantage of Andrew's tendency to follow and not his orientation, but no one has questioned the assertion here, so I'll grudgingly accept the possibility that I missed something. Still, there should be references to specific scenes to back up the assertion, IMO. It's good practice anyway. <a href="../../../x/i/n/User%7EXiner_4ce3.html" title="User:Xiner">Xiner</a> 01:16, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

I thought that his behavior towards Spike (particularly during his guest appearances in Angel) was the strongest indication that he might have had some gay tendencies, but I honestly don't think that it really meant anything, particularly since in The Girl in Question he went out with a hot chick on each arm. I think that he merely had some feminime behaviorisms, and that his affectionate actions merely showed his sincere intentions to become a part of the "good" guys and show loyalty. There were scenes where he and Jonathan (in Mexico, I believe) slept in bed together, and it seemed pretty clear that nothing happened, that they were close friends who shared a bed out of necessity. I thought that he looked up to Warren as a leader and mentor, but didn't see that Warren had any particularly sexual power over him. The Scott Bakula reference was just funny, but can't a dude appreciate another dude without being gay? Tambourineman 17:23, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

-Andrew's "Homosexuality"-</p>
<p>'member, there's isn't just heterosexual or homosexual. Some people, ahem, "play both sides of the field." I remember watching those episodes and wondering myself if he wasn't homosexual or bisexual. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Casyle (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Casyle_505c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Casyle">contribs</a>) 07:33, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</small></p>
