<p>It is sad to see that Telugu history being distorted by others who are interested to paint Telugu history as that of Tamils (E.g., Vengi) or Kannadigas (Rashtrakuta and Vijayanagar). For instance, the evidences in favour of Telugu origin of Vijayanagar Empire were downplayed and enormous material (authentic or otherwise) was included to show that Telugus had no contribution. It is common knowledge that Telugu literature had a heyday during the time of Krishnadevarayan who himself was a great Telugu poet. It was totally ignored by one Kannada parochial historian, Dinesh Kannambadi, who has been playing havoc with history and is attempting to show that South Indian history is Karnataka history.Telugu historians must wake up from slumber, take interest in Wikipedia and restore the true picture.</p>
<p><br />
balls to your knoweldge.more than 60% of records,inscriptions during vijayanagar kingdom is maintaining in kannada &amp; the rest in sanskrit,prakrit &amp; telugu. It is also very well known fact that vijayanagr kingdom has roots in karnataka &amp; kannadigas. Also telugu was the personal preference of Sri krishnadevaraya (who btw is tuluva kannadiga &amp; not a telugite) &amp; during his days telugu saw the beginning of their literature. So instead of being thankful to kannadigas u r trying putting some bullshit. You nerd tell me how many places of historical or ancient significance is in Andhra compared to tamilnadu or karnataka despite being such a big state in the south. Also Kannada inscriptions are the highest in the country than any other language &amp; that tells the most of the story.</p>
<p>Sri Krishnadeva Raya, a Kannadiga, proclaimed 'Desa Bhashalandu Telugu lessa', which literally means 'Of all the Indian languages, Telugu is the Sweetest'.</p>
<p>Also u r not anything great compared to Karnataka &amp; Tamilnadu in any respect. Your pathetic culture &amp; attitude sucks. It's a fact.</p>

<p>The article definitely deserves it "B-class" status. It is poorly organized and the quality of English at some places is poor. Where are the Telugu scholars and PhDs? Maybe someone should ask professors from Government universities to contribute to wikipedia - they do have a lot of time on their hands. Unfortunately, I do not have enough knowledge in this area to edit what has been written. I have removed some (rather poorly written) sections which contained redundant information (on Telugu for example-there is a page for the language and related issues).</p>

<p>This article is sickeningly biased. In the "Economy" section, it says:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"With a dynamic leadership, the state is steering the nation to new dimensions in the fields of Information Technology, Biotechnology, Pharmaceuticals, Business Management, Construction, etc., to emerge as a land of immense business opportunities."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Contrast this with the following, written in a recent Guardian article:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"During the hungry season, hundreds of thousands of people in Andhra Pradesh are now kept alive on gruel supplied by charities. Last year, hundreds of children died in an encephalitis outbreak because of the shortage of state-run hospitals. The state government's own figures suggest that 77% of the population have fallen below the poverty line. The measurement criteria are not consistent, but this appears to be a massive rise. In 1993 there was one bus a week taking migrant workers from a depot in Andhra Pradesh to Mumbai. Today there are 34. The dispossessed must reduce themselves to the transplanted coolies of Blair's new empire."</i> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,1218982,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,1218982,00.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></dd>

He shd have probly moved it to a separate sub-section. btw, "Andhra Natyam" scores only 218 hits on google and is not as famous as, say Kuchipudi (83,000 hits).

<p>I have reverted these edits because of several factual distortions. Neelam Sanjiva Reddy was the first chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, not Bezwada Gopal Reddy. Bezwada was the second chief minister of Andhra (that is, the state without Telangana), after Tanguturi Prakasam. Indira Gandhi contested from Medak in 1980, not 1982; no record to show that NTR supported her. Chandrababu Naidu joined TDP only after it came to power. Also, the edits had a lot of POV and a bit of personal attacks.

<dd>Hello V Pavan Kumar. We understand that you added these links in the article in good faith. However, we feel that these links shouldn't find a place here. The reason being that Wikipedia is an Encyclopedia and not a gossip magazine. For details, see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> to know what Wikipedia is not. Hence, as a policy, we discourage links to commercial websites unless the website is directly relevant to the topic being discussed and will help the encyclopedia reader in understanding the topic better and in reliable manner. The trouble with commercial websites is often with respect to reliability and self-promotion. Note that the issue whether they provide interesting information is also your point of view. The govt. of Andhra Pradesh starts its day on ugadi with panchangam, so this specific information can be added (in not more than a single sentence) in the govt. of Andhra Pradesh's article while discussing it under religious influence on govt's functioning. But however, this does not mean that we add links to all sites that provide panchangam. If the site in question is THE ONLY SITE to provide panchangam, then its notable; else its not and should not be mentioned. -<a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbuj.Saxena_7172.html" title="User:Ambuj.Saxena">Ambuj Saxena</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/b/User_talk%7EAmbuj.Saxena_ee93.html" title="User talk:Ambuj.Saxena">talk</a>) 11:21, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There are several instances where the state is referred to simply as “Andhra”. Since the term “Andhra” is sometimes also used in reference to the coastal region. I think it would be best to use the term “Andhra Pradesh” when the referring to the state. -- Brown cp 23:09, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Between 1953 and 1956 there used to be a state called "Andhra State" which was merged with Telangana(Telugu speaking districts of Hyderabad state) in 1956 to become "Andhra Pradesh" state. So Tanguturi Prakasham Pantulu is first Chief Minister of Andhra State and Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy is first Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh State.</p>

<p>Andhra and Telangana are synonyms. Andhra is Sanskrit word and Telangana is Telugu word for Telugu country. Even the coastal region is part of Telangana although popular usage does not confirm to this fact. E.g., 1. Andhra Satavahanas who ruled the major part of Souhth India for 500 years covered the whole of present day Telugu speaking region. 2. When Musunuri Prolaneedu recaptured Warangal from Delhi sultanate and united the whole Telugu country he proclaimed himself "Andhradesaadheeswara" and "Andhrasuratraana". It is unfortunate that Telugu people got mentally alienated from each other by various historical and economic reasons.</p>

<p>Currently the order is regions, cities and then districts. The order has been changed to Regions, districts to cities.</p>
<p>The description of the regions did not correspond to the order of the descriptions. The regions were listed in the following order Coastal Andhra, Telangana and then Rayalaseema. But the descriptions were in the following order Telangana, Coastal Andhra and then Rayalseema. This has been fixed the order of listing (according to population size) now corresponds to the order of the description.</p>
<p>The order of the cities needs to be cleaned up. The cities are not ordered according to size. Does anyone know of a source that shows the relative size of Andhra Pradesh cities? -- Brown cp 00:43, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Currently there are 23 universities listed. This listing merely consisting of the names of the universities is not really informative to a reader looking for an overview of AP. The list has to be pruned, based on size, history, repuation and etc. Until then I have deleted the listing all together. It would be better to include information on Eductation in general in AP as opposed to merely listing the universities.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Agree, Lot of those universties are not at all well known. Just mentioning something about popular universities "Osmania, Andhra and Sri Venkateswara" here and keeping list of all universties in AndhraPradesh in separate article is fine. The government of A.P. has divided the state into three divisions. See <a href="http://www.hindu.com/2006/06/13/stories/2006061319760500.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.hindu.com/2006/06/13/stories/2006061319760500.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hindu.com/2006/06/13/stories/2006061319760500.htm</a> for example. That was the case when I studied. I think state government has recognised Kakatiya as the fourth division recently. All other universties are not significant. <a href="../../../m/l/p/User%7EMlpkr_f425.html" title="User:Mlpkr">Mlpkr</a> 17:10, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I believe that the current form is a POV, when it concerns Madras. The article says that historically and culturally Madras always belonged to Andhra Pradesh. However, the famous historical symbols like <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parthasarathy_Temple_85cb.html" title="Parthasarathy Temple">Parthasarathy Temple</a> and <a href="../../../k/a/p/Kapaleeswarar_Temple_1e71.html" title="Kapaleeswarar Temple">Kapaleeswarar Temple</a> along with many other temples are all Tamil. Throughout ancient history the Madras region was in Tamil provinces of Pallava rule, and the greatest Tamil poet, <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thiruvalluvar.html" title="Thiruvalluvar">Thiruvalluvar</a> hailed from this place. So, kindly modify the paragraph concerning Madras in the Creation of Andra Pradesh. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalajiviswanathan_cdc2.html" title="User:Balajiviswanathan">Balajiviswanathan</a> 00:23, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am from Nellore, A.P. which is very near to Madras. Many old people in our area know the matter that Tirupati (where Tamil speaking people are more) is given in return for Madras(where telugu speaking people are more) in those days. They also recalled that Madras governor was against giving even separate state, so Potti Sriramulu from Nellore went on hunger strike and sacrificing life. It is true, but personally I am okay with removing it not to hurt sentiments like yours. Shall we? In regard to your other comment about Pallava's, just not Madras, but lot of the coastal Andhra was under Pallavas, cholas etc. It is no doubt that Tamil was older than Telugu, but the demographics must have been changed later. <a href="../../../m/l/p/User%7EMlpkr_f425.html" title="User:Mlpkr">Mlpkr</a> 16:59, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Pallavas were satraps of Andhra Satavahanas in Palnadu region (Guntur district) who became independent after the downfall of Satavahanas. They initially ruled coastal Andhra and spread their kingdom upto Tamil regions. Later, they shifted the capital to Kanchi due to pressure from Chalukyan kings. Historians agree that Pallavas were of Aryan (Pahlava/Kambhoja) origin but not related to Tamils. Telugu was predominantly spoken upto Kanchi till the advent of British. Joining Tamil areas to Madras first by rail gradually changed the demography towards Tamil dominance. It is prudent on everyone's part to accept history and coexist peacefully. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_59.165.151.180_b5f1.html" title="Special:Contributions/59.165.151.180">59.165.151.180</a> (<a href="../../../5/9/2E/User_talk%7E59.165.151.180.html" title="User talk:59.165.151.180">talk</a>) 11:31, 17 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
