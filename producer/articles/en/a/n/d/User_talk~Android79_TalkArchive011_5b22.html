<p>This aims to be a launch page for regional cultures. This is different from going to a single country and not looking at it in the context of its region. Also the article aims to highlight cultural similarities within regions, not just single cultures by themselves. Just as someone wanting to know about the US might just want to know a summary of US culture rather than an article length bit about it, so people may want to know a little about regional differences in cultures from a broad geographical perspective, not looking up each and every country specifically.</p>
<p>The advantage of a top-down approach is you can get the ball rolling much more easily; I don't have time, or maybe even an interest in writing a culture of East Asia article. But by putting it out there, we can bring in the masses to contribute however much they want and build up the article little by little. That's one of the best of advantages of wiki over traditional encyclopedia.--Culturesoftheworld 16:56, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Android. Well, to be honest, I'm rather skeptical about this user <i>ever</i> being serious, and find his behavior bears serious resemblance to <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_troll.html" title="Internet troll">a certain small being</a> that shall remain unnamed. Personally I don't see much evidence that he's ever really tried to contribute usefully in good conscience, although I know that the holidays seem to being out the worst in some people and vandalism is high this time of year (though, conversely, people who appear this time of year sometimes appear just to make trouble as an outlet for negativity, etc.).</p>
<p>However, even <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assuming good faith</a>, I think that at least a month or two is warranted -- not as punishment, but because in my experience a <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_time-out.html" title="Child time-out">time out</a> (which is the purpose, IMHO) is generally only effective if it's in proportion to the insistence of the behavior. And Maoririder is one insistent user. I fear that he'll be happy to wait a few days and then come back with a vengeance -- and the fact that he's still doing "drive-bys" leaving messages about "n***az" and calling me a "redneck" tells me that he's not angry, but he's trying to provoke a reaction.</p>
<p>So that's where <i>I</i> am. At this point I'd support (and carry out) reducing the block to expire no sooner than <i>31 January 2006</i>, which would give him time to cool off and truly reflect on his actions if they're motivated by misunderstanding and anger rather than maliciousness and a desire to provoke reactions in others. Otherwise, I won't reblock him if someone else unblocks, but I wouldn't support it (not that my support is necessary, by any means). And I'm happy to open up the discussion for more input, but would suggest a good set of links that give a representative sample of his behavior are easily accessible for those who are asked to weigh in.</p>

Not only are they both from Maine, but they both started making legal threats within minutes of each other, and they both spent days adding {{reqimage}} tags to random articles (look back where theirs is the last edit). When this IP was blocked they started going on in a purposefully confusing manner about how they were going to sue "the other person" using the IP when it was clearly them all along. In addition, this IP uses a different, but also characteristic style to try to appear different from Maoririder, but the template adding and edited articles give them away.

<dd>Hello, Android79. Regarding the situation with Maoririder: I think reducing the block down to one week would be more appropriate, and if the behavior persists or if he starts again, apply a longer block (two weeks) and keep on doing this until he either gets the point or he's indefinitely blocked. I'm willing to continue my attempts at mediation with him here. Thoughts? Thanks! <a href="../../../f/l/c/User%7EFlcelloguy_1bb8.html" title="User:Flcelloguy">Flcelloguy</a> <small>(<a href="../../../f/l/c/User_talk%7EFlcelloguy_7b23.html" title="User talk:Flcelloguy">A <font color="brown">note?</font></a>)</small> 20:47, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>If you've got the time at the moment, start a dialogue on ANI about this; I will do so later this evening if I get the chance (and if it hasn't already been done). <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 20:50, 20 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Noticed your post on Bcorr's talk page - sorry, the mediation mailing list is private.&#160;:-) Anyways, I don't think a post to ANI will be necessary. All that will do is complicate the situation. Maoririder has already been through an RfAr and is already under a mentorship (currently me), and the ArbCom has explicitly given us permission to delete, block, or do anything else we need to do to attempt to get him to shape up. That's why I don't think a block over a week's length is the best choice for now - this will be the first time he's been blocked since the ending of his arbitration case, and increasing block lengths will probably do more good than a long block to start off with. Thoughts?

<dd>If that was the case, then rather than professing your support for Morwen's snide sarcasm, you would have been better suited simply shutting up!

<p>I don't know, I don't think so, but I sign my name Gator not Gator1....I dunno.

<p>I am one of your newer Wikipedians. There are three characters, primarily, that pop up almost on every article and its accompanying talk page. These three are constantly putting my comments down because they disagree, but they keep threatening to stop me from using Wikipedia. I do have an article that I've started on <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_American_Spirituality_bfb3.html" title="Native American Spirituality">Native American Spirituality</a> and I really enjoy the things I find on Wikipedia. I do not know the real names of these three, but I do have their Wikipedia ID names. Can I have your email address in order to communicate with you more privately on this matter. I'm not very diplomatic at all and I'm learning, but I should be able to state my point of view on the article talk pages, I think, as anyone else can.--Bumpusmills1 05:43, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

If you could provide the names of the editors you say are harassing you, that would be a good start. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 17:05, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Thanks for adding a stat year field, i was triping over trying to use one. Do you know if you can default a feild to a value? and would it be a good idea to create and extended version of the template with more fields? <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackalsclaw_6e75.html" title="User:Jackalsclaw">Jackalsclaw</a> 04:14, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Your keyboard ought to have a backslash (\) key, probably above Enter.

<p>By the way, my "quirks" are from being a military brat(Soldiers' child) and I had kin in some of the "alphabet agencies", thus I ended as a secretive person, since the kin often "talked shop" around me, and told <i>me</i> that ordinary civilians will not understand this kind of upbringing at all. NO, I am NOT like some spy or anything like that at all, just like the average "Joe Sixpack" or "John Q Public". Hope this helps. I've also been doing some Google Searches. Did you know that <i>all</i> of the Users' commentary <i>is</i> out there for all of the world to see, including offensive commentary&#160;? You would <i>not</i> believe <i>what</i> is out there. Other Users may have had a similar upbringing as I have had, long before there was a Internet, much less Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 21:10, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Delete this article, and you can tell User Dreamguy that I have <i>repeatedly</i> read the indicated references, otherwise, I would'nt have been able to create these articles: <a href="../../../u/f/o/UFOs_in_fiction_7d2f.html" title="UFOs in fiction">UFOs in fiction</a>, <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_resistance_movements_and_groups.html" title="Fictional resistance movements and groups">Fictional resistance movements and groups</a>, Glenn spencer's <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Patrol_c178.html" title="American Patrol">American Patrol</a> Report, UFO Casebook. I am <i>not</i> a biased person at all. As for User Beckjord <i>is</i> concerned, I have found a Wiki-link that may suit him, providing he calls off his latest war, the <b>WAFE</b> affair.</p>
<p>This device is being sold to help people commit a criminal act(Last time I looked, drug use in the US is <b>illegal</b>) and become a public safety problem. If it is being sold in the US, those responsible <i>will</i> end up in prison. You asked about what to do with this article. I strongly recomend that you "speedy delete" it, and if it comes up for a "Afd" I will vote to have the article terminated. This too is not bias either. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 22:52, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
