<p>I love this book and have read many times, but perhaps I am wrong but I think there is a mistake in the book in chapter1 section V. Macarthur is recalling in his head how his old friends have been shunning him all do to a rumor. The text read "Armstrong had talked he supposed". The next section vi talks about Dr. Armstrong. I would think most first time readers would be confused and think that Armstrong and Macarthur know each other. Later Macarthur recalls a person named Armitage. Did Christie mean to write Armitage in chap1 v and write Armstrong instead and no editor ever caught it? <a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmith03_8e63.html" title="User:Smith03">Smith03</a> 19:24, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't mean to be trifling, here. I think that the original title of the book, should be mentioned in order to display the attitude of the times and how <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_correctness.html" title="Political correctness">political correctness</a> ate up the title, in order to cover the original offensive title and keep the book sales going... Fuck it... come the revolution anybody that's <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_correctness.html" title="Political correctness">polytically correct</a> will rank 6th up the wall.</p>

<dd>I agree with you in principle, but there's no need to get riled up about it. It looks like a well-meaning anon who probably had not heard about the original title and didn't read the article fully to find out more. A mistake, not an agenda.

<p>As recently as 1988 I obtained a copy of the British version of the book (at London's Heathrow Airport) under "And Then There Were None" but which referred to the island and the rhyme with "Nigger Island" and "Nigger Boys". I think the title and contents should reflect that it is a period piece where the word "Nigger" did not necessarily have the offensive context it does now.</p>
<p>The word "Nigger" is offensive in modern times, I agree. However, trying to retroactively wipe it out deny history and cultural times. Two of the greatest crimes in historical history were the destruction of the works of the Mayans, and the library at Alexandra due to Christian destruction of pagan works. I won't be a party to a cover-up of history.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ten Little Niggers is the original UK title, but even when it was first published, it was released as And Then There Were None for US publication. It was renamed Ten Little Indians later on. Although I agree the original UK title needs to be recognised, this is by no means a recent "politically correct" revision. The word Nigger was offensive in America even at the time, and And Then There Were None has claims to be a genuine alternative title, so I don't really think this is a crime comparable with the destruction of Mayan cultural works. <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobelia_e9a3.html" title="User:Tobelia">Tobelia</a> 14:31, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In Finnish, the book was published in 1940, and the name was "Eikä yksikään pelastunut" (And nobody survived). In 1968, the reprint's name was "Kymmenen pientä neekeripoikaa" (Ten little negro boys). The 2004 edition had again the original Finnish name. --<a href="../../../l/a/l/User%7ELalli_e273.html" title="User:Lalli">Lalli</a> 09:06, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I beleive the page should be move to <i>And then there were none</i> for the reason a lot of Christie's books were originally published under a different name but are listed on wikipedia under their most common name. This seems to be the only book that is listed under its original title. The book I believe is far more commonly known as ATTWN or 10 L Indians than 10 L niggers. The article should of course state the orginal title but the page itself I believe should be under ATTWN which is far more well known title of the book play and movies.<a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmith03_8e63.html" title="User:Smith03">Smith03</a> 21:10, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The page move should definitely have been discussed here first. Google give some support for you: "And Then There Were None +Christie" gets some 40,000 hits (although the majority seem to be about the movies); "Ten Little Indians +Christie" gets about 13,000 (+10,000 for "10" instead of "ten"); and "Ten Little Niggers +Christie" gets about 3,500 (+100 for "10" instead of "ten"). In itself, that's a reflection of political correctness; other web authors have doubtless hesitated to use the offensive title. However, I suggest we get the input of the Christie experts on hand, since it's a touchy subject addressed many times before in many other forums. — <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatherineMunro_0200.html" title="User:CatherineMunro">Catherine</a>\<sup><a href="../../../c/a/t/User_talk%7ECatherineMunro_06c5.html" title="User talk:CatherineMunro">talk</a></sup> 23:00, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>removed "this book does not contain" from the intro. It seems a funny way to describe the book. Very few of Christie's detectives were all-knowing. Hercule Poirot is it, really;</li>
<li>removed enumeration of occupations of the victims (there was a general, not an admiral, and I am sure that people of the time would have referred to the first guy as a gentlemen, not an heir!) and shrunk the plot summary;</li>
<li>rearranged the subtitle to refer to the play first, because it came before the films;</li>
<li>removed the external link because whilst the "study guide" it talks about looks to be dubious value, it is hard to tell because you have to pay to see most of it. I think the external links policy doesn't like that;</li>
<li>removed reference to the short story because I really don't see the relevance of a story about anarchistic passive resistance.</li>

<dd>Source for Christie's dissatisfaction with prior adaptations is her autobiography. I would like to see a source for the idea that it was originally published as <i>A Nigger in the Woodpile</i>. I've never heard that. Something I haven't done is to transwiki the rhyme to Wikisource, but it does need doing. It should be on Wikisource rather than on Wikipedia. There is, annoyingly, no template for "transwiki this section". There is only one for "transwiki this article". Which I am not sure is terribly appropriate&#160;:) Also, the long long sentence about the Russian film doesn't make any logical sense. Is the judgement call about political correctness being made and applied to the first title or to the second? I left that for someone else to sort out.</dd>

<p>"supposedly non offensive"? Would someone really ever be offended by "And Then There Were None?" If this is so, then perhaps every book title can be considered "possibly offensive".

<p>On August 18, text was added to this article stating that although "many" people believe that <i>Ten Little Niggers</i> (TLN) was the original title of the book, <i>The Nigger in the Woodpile</i> (TNITW) was the "true original title... which could not be used in public for reasons of political correctness."</p>
<p>This makes no sense for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>How could a book be <i>published</i> under a title that "could not be used in public"?</li>
<li>If TNITW was an unacceptable title at the time, how could TLN have been acceptable?</li>
<li>Online catalog searches show that neither the Bodleian Library (a depository library), nor the Library of Congress (likewise), nor the UCLA or University of Toronto libraries, have the book listed as TNITW. They all have it listed as TLN, even though that title was never used in the US, and some of them have entries for an unrelated work called TNITW.</li>
<li>The book <i>The Agatha Christie Companion</i>, which discusses the problematic titles at some length, makes no mention of the title TNITW.</li>
<li>No hits anywhere near the top of a Google search in English on "Christie" plus the TNITW title are using the phrase as the title of the book, except this article and mirrors of it.</li>
</ul>
<p>My initial thought was that this must be vandalism, but I see that the person who introduced these changes has made others that are not vandalish. So I now think he was simply copying an erroneous source. Perhaps TNITW was a working title during the writing of the book, and Christie or her publishers then simply decided that they liked TLN better... but that is only my conjecture, and should not go in the page unless confirmed!</p>
<p>Several web pages point out that the <i>phrase</i> TNITW appears in the book (even in the US editions under other titles), and I guess it's possible that this may have something to do with the origins of such an error.</p>
<p>Anyway, I am boldly deleting all references to TNITW as a title; if someone has a source that confirms it after all, then let's see what it is. Because at the moment, I just don't believe it. (Not because I think the use of that title would be implausible, understand; only that there would be plenty of supporting evidence if it was ever used.)</p>

<dd>According to this article <a href="http://www.rethinkingschools.org/archive/20_01/agat201.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rethinkingschools.org/archive/20_01/agat201.shtml" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> the phrase "Nigger in the Woodpile" occurred in the third act of the <i>play</i>, but has meanwhile been replaced with "guilty party" by Samuel French Inc. who hold the (US?) rights to the play. I suppose that the idea that this phrase was the original title somehow stems from there. 213.47.127.75 07:47, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the plot section, it says characters in order of death. First of all, they are missing the first victim. Second, not all of them die. Philip Lombard, and Vera doesn't die. It should also mention Philip Lombard isn't the real Lombard but Lombard's friend posing as him.</p>
<p>Excuse me, but HAVE YOU EVEN READ THE BOOK? Lombard is Lombard, Vera shoots him and then hangs herself. Also, the first victim is ANTHONY MARSTON, "Prince Nicky" only appears in the 1945 movie version.</p>

<li>When Lombard finds his missing pistol {replaced by Wargrave} supposedly for an experienced Mercenary he doesn't automaticaly check to see if its still loaded or not. If he had, he would have seen that it had not been fired and he would have then remembered that when he; Blore; and Armstrong had ran to Vera's room {she had screamed when she felt wet seaweed on her neck} that there would not have been enough time for anyone to have shot Wargrave. Therefore 1) Armstrong was Lying 2) Wargrave was not dead 3) Armstrong and Wargrave were secret allies.

<dd>"The memes "ten little Indians" and "and then there was one" have been used many times in modern days to refer to situations in stories – such as slasher films, other horror films, and disaster films — in which the characters die off one by one. This is how many films of those genres are structured in order to both provide gory scenes periodically, and to ultimately force the main character to face off against the villain alone. This main character in slasher films is often referred to as the "final girl" and shares many similarities with the doomed Vera Claythorne, the final victim in Christie's novel."</dd>

<p>I don't think this part of the article is particularly encyclopedic. In particular, the use of the term "meme" is ill-advised. Memes have nothing to do with this point. Meme-theory is by no means established enough as a mode of cultural analysis, or of literary criticism, to be deployed as casually as it is here, and without qualification. I mean, it's an application of evolutionary theory to cultural analysis, for God's sake. It's science-fiction. And it's largely arbitrary - it doesn't tell you anything about what you're talking about - it just makes propositions as to what kind of entity an idea is. This doesn't belong in a wikipedia article that has nothing to do with Richard Dawkins. I suggest substituting a more appropriate word, like "theme", which is much more neutral and, I'll wager, the word the writer was looking for in the first place. <a href="../../../f/i/o/User%7EFionnmatthew_0cb8.html" title="User:Fionnmatthew">Fionnmatthew</a> 20:03, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
