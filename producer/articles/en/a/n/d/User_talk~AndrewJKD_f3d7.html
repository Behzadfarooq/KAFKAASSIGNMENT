<dd>Thank you very much for notifying this to me, and explaining your reasons. I understand, and I have tried to improve the article. I have moved the article to <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Agathonicus_and_Companions_3e9b.html" title="Saint Agathonicus and Companions">Saint Agathonicus and Companions</a>, which is is where Acyndinus falls.

<dd>No problem. The merge definitely looks to be a move in the right direction - thanks. You may want to make a note of what calendar (e.g., Old Roman Calendar (pre-1959), current, Eastern Orthodox, etc) observe the feast day. You may also want to search the online catholic encyclopedia, I think I remember that there is an article about the author of the panengeric of Agathonicus (his name escapes me right now).</dd>
<dd>I am trying to clean up Wikipedia's treatment of saints some - expanding where there is notablility, remove where not, because I feel it is an important topic. FYI, I notice that you have created a number of articles on saints. The current naming conventions, <a href="../../../n/c/w/WP%7ENCWC_6acc.html" title="WP:NCWC">WP:NCWC</a> recommend not using "Saint" in the article title.</dd>

<p>That's great, thanks so much. FYI, when moving pages, click on "what links here" and make sure there are no "<a href="../../../2/r/_/WP%7E2R_f763.html" title="WP:2R">double re-directs</a>." In essence, if you see a "redirect page" that links to another redirect page, send it to the actual article instead. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPastordavid_9d78.html" title="User:Pastordavid">Pastordavid</a> 23:07, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I wanted to move this article you created, but thought I would ask you about it first. <a href="../../../t/o/l/Tola.html" title="Tola">Tola</a> is already in use as the judge of Israel. Would you object to "Tola of Clonard" per <a href="http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/coclare/history/osl/disert1_situation.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/coclare/history/osl/disert1_situation.htm" rel="nofollow">this source</a>? (I know that you listed "meath," but it seems that he was bishop of Clonard after living in Meath). I will also, once moved, put an "other uses" at the top of the page ("Tola" is actually part of the title of a bunch of articles, including being an alternate name for Saint Olaf). I look forward to your reply. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPastordavid_9d78.html" title="User:Pastordavid">Pastordavid</a> 19:21, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's fine with me; I noticed <a href="../../../t/o/l/Tola.html" title="Tola">Tola</a> was in use, but I think that Tola of Clonard would work fine. Thank you for asking me! <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewJKD_3da7.html" title="User:AndrewJKD">Andrew</a> 20:50, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
