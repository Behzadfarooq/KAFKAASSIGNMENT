<p>Wotcha matey. Good work on the Filth page lately! I really don't like that photo we're using though - would you mind if we changed it to one of these (take your pick)? I think they're a bit more stylish and unusual than the old "standing in a line looking scary" pose, and they're also a little bit goofy, which I think is a good representation of the band having their tongue firmly in their cheek a lot of the time. I'm not good on the different lineups so i'd need you to do a caption again - I guess it'd have to be "clockwise" this time...</p>
<p>Not a problem if you disagree - just see what you think. We could put the black logo back on top again (unless you're handy with photoshop).</p>

<dl>
<dd>50px|rightNah that sounds like a damn good idea, I think that the one on the right (Above, and to this text right) looks the best of those two. I will download it and photoshop the logo in, just like i did for the one that is current. This time, I will make it (the logo) blue with a black drop-shadow, because that would be the best with the color scheme of the photo. Great ideas, dude! We should collaborate more on these things!<br />

<dd>I'm really pleased with how the page is looking lately. When I first stumbled across it about a month ago it looked like it had been written by an infinite number of monkeys in crayon - I was really EMBARRASSED by it. So I've completely overhauled it and rewritten it since then and I think we're winning now. Leyasu can be frustrating but she does a good job of keeping it un-vandalised. She's NEVER not online - it's extraordinary! <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECardinal_Wurzel_81fe.html" title="User:Cardinal Wurzel">Cardinal Wurzel</a> 19th Feb 2006, 10:04gmt</dd>

<p>Hey there, newly monikered Andy Blak! Where you been? Bill Hicks came from Austin. Kudos! I wouldn't bother with London - it's a fucking shithole. If you ever come to Britain I recommend you go anywhere BUT there. I've protected the Cradle page like you suggested, but am I allowed to do that, do you think? Should we have applied for permission from an admin or something? How did your own bid for admin status go?

<dd>Hallo mate! Thanks for the suggestions on where to visit! Yeah, I think we have to request protection from an admin, we should prolly talk to <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">User:Tony Sidaway</a>. He is the one who dealt with the whole "Leyasu" incident. And as for my own run.... well... you were the only one to vote hahaha so it failed. Oh well. Ill try again someother time!

<p>When I began to use a nickname, I started with "Andy Filth" I soon realized that that name was B.S. So I spent some time asking people about a new nickname. Then one day, when I was on stage playing guitar, I had a fan come up to me and say only two words "Andy Black." Damn. He was right. So I cut off the "c" and you have "Andy Blak." Below is my reason for having "Andy Filth" originally.</p>
<p>Okay, so if you are here, you probably know that I go by "Andy Filth" on this website and on stage. Do I know that I am completely ripping off <a href="../../../c/r/a/Cradle_of_Filth_99df.html" title="Cradle of Filth">Cradle of Filth</a>'s lead singer <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dani_Filth_201a.html" title="Dani Filth">Dani Filth</a>? Yes. And intentionally for that matter. I practically worship the guy, and since my real name, Andy, is close to Dani, I figured what the hell.... and I call myself Andy Filth. Feel free to comment, I dont mind persecution or criticism.... or, if you're a fan, praise.</p>

<p><br />
Hi Andy5190, I'm afraid what Getcrunk (and the other folks above) say is right. I want to try and help you understand why you have several people asking to change these, so hopefully you don't think I'm talking down to you. Basically, even if we take a picture of a CD cover with our own cameras its still someone's copyrighted work. We can release it with {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}} all day, but it doesn't change the legality because someone else still retains all the rights.</p>
<p>Wikipedia allows images like these to be used in an illustrative sense, like in the article about that album or band, because we're not trying to claim ownership. Its a much scarier legal area (from my understanding on Wiki policies) to allow these images into "private" areas of Wikipedia, like your userpage. In effect, Wiki through you is breaking the copyright laws and could have legal action taken against it...and even though you were the one who placed the image, its <b>our</b> responsibility to make sure that we comply with the law.</p>
<p>If there is any way I can help you (aside from providing art&#160;;) ) I'll do my best, but please remove the images. I can try to find replacement images, but I'll admit that the free icons and such I know of aren't all that applicable to what you want to display. Thanks! ps - I'm again going to be away from the computer until tomorrow so hopefully I can address any problems then. <a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 21:58, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello again. Your user page is much improved, the only image that I see there now that's fair use (and hence not allowable on user pages) is Image:Cradle2 logo.jpg (on the right hand side). I'm not surprised at the confusion, copyright law is quite complex, but it is important to get right. "fair use" is a a tricky subject, but (while not legally exact) it may help to think of it as being fair to use images in articles that are <b>about the subject</b>. Thus, the above image would be reasonable in an article written about Cradle of Faith, but not in an article that's not about them (as your user page is). (In that sense an image is not "fair use" in isolation, it depends on <b>where</b> it is used whether it is fair or not). I hope that makes some sort of sense, and it'd be cool if you could remove the last image that's not fair use on a user page.

<dd>Nope. As you can see from the bottom of the main page, it says "all content (c) Cradle of filth 2004", so none of these images can be used on your user page. Sorry. Thanks for sorting the last image out, though. Regards, <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinRe_7317.html" title="User:MartinRe">MartinRe</a> 23:16, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A sense of completion is around when I take a look at my new userpage. I am about 98% sure that everything is FUC. I got <u>all</u> of my images from Wiki Commons!

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Cradle of Filth 2006.jpg</b>. I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_criteria_7a9f.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use criteria">first fair use criterion</a> in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information. If you believe this image is not replaceable, please:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the image description page and edit it to add <code>{{Replaceable fair use disputed}}</code>, <b>without deleting the original Replaceable fair use template</b>.</li>
<li>On the image discussion page, write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.</li>
</ol>
<p>Alternatively, you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequesting_copyright_permission_5781.html" title="Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission">requesting that the copyright holder release this (or a similar) image under a free license</a>, or by taking a picture of it yourself.</p>

Note that any fair use images which are replaceable by free-licensed alternatives will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html#Images.2FMedia" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">criteria for speedy deletion</a>.
