<p>Android 17 is not an important character, he's probably a tertiary character. Lots of secondary and tertiary characters have already nonsensically been merged, so there's no logical reason that this even lesser character who appears in 15 episodes total and has one movie appearance to have his own page. Secondary characters such as Zarbon, Dabura, Android 16, and General Blue have much heavier appearances and much longer roles and have already been merged. There's no logical reason to keep this lesser character as his own page.</p>
<p>you bring up a good point. i agree about all those examples being more important than 17 also. in light of this argument, it may be best to merge him as well in order to keep with the same structuring and remain unbiased and not favor one character above others. - 69.86.243.244</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't agree with the merger. Yeah, Android 17 is not very major in comparison to a lot of other characters, but he's still a major character in the series. He wanted to make a sport of hunting Goku, he fought on an even level with Piccolo, and he's got a strong role in the Super 17 Saga. Speaking of which, the Super 17 article might be merged with this one, so there's no point of keeping the tag for this. So I'm removing the tag of this article until at least the Super 17 one is resolved.</dd>

<p>The picture of 17 in the GT section is from the Buu saga, when he is donating ki to Goku.--<a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECassius987_fa4e.html" title="User:Cassius987">Cassius987</a> 22:48, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>How can Android 17 be killed again by Gohan during the climax in the Cell Games?? Cell had blown himself up and regenerated with the use of his main cell. He could do this because his body remembered his perfect form, thus he did not need Android 18. But when he first blew himself up his body, along with that of Android 17 was destroyed....Cell did regenarate himself but not Android 17. I mean how could he?? His cells could create a new perfecrt body...they did not create Android 17 all over again....</p>
<dl>
<dd>I disagree for two reasons.</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>It's not proven for a fact that he was completely killed in Cell's self destruction. Nobody said Cell did create another 17 inside himself, but nobody said he didn't or that he even lost 17 in him the first time. Cell only said something about his cells still remembering the perfect power even though he lost <i>18</i>, but he never said a thing about losing <i>17</i>. To me, that statement of cloudiness leaves it <b>entirely possible</b> that even through that one living cell left, Cell still had 17 all along, and 17 truly died <b>the first and only time in this saga</b> when Cell was destroyed by Gohan.</li>
<li>It's a contradiction of the facts. If 17's actual death in that saga was actually when Cell self-destructed, and he was brought back to life from that point, wouldn't he rematerialize where King Kai's planet was? If so, how did he manage to be on earth and lead a life from there? He would have to have died on earth in order to be on earth after revival, since they didn't make a wish to move the guy. And which "death" of Cell was <i>on earth</i>? The Gohan destruction. NOT the self-destruction on King Kai's planet.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>From that, I am and always have been convinced that Seventeen's actual death in the saga was Cell's destruction at the hands of Gohan.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>this is the part where I say "WHO CARES!". But it's an interesting conundrum. I'd say it was an oversight on the part of whoever wrote the script.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarhawkman_ce32.html" title="User:Marhawkman">Marhawkman</a> 08:00, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>17 is often said to have no Ki. But if he really didn't have ANY AT ALL, then he wouldn't have been able to contribute energy to the Spirit Bomb. Then there's the fact that he's a cyborg. While he has cybernetic implants that give him incredible powers, most of his body is made of the same stuff as an ordinary human.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarhawkman_ce32.html" title="User:Marhawkman">Marhawkman</a> 08:11, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>There are some likely explanations.Most likely he only has the ki of a normal human, which is around 5 I think. Meaning they still wouldn't be able to tell him apart from other humans. Though goku seems to be able to know someones ki. The cybernetic implants either elimnated his natural human ki.the implants might do everything, including keeping him alive,or they mask it. Or akira toriyama didn't give it a second thought.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I like the last one."akira toriyama didn't give it a second thought." The main reason I brought it up is the dispute that arose from when goku said he could sense the ki of Super 17 in GT.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarhawkman_ce32.html" title="User:Marhawkman">Marhawkman</a> 14:35, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Just a short sidenote as well, when Goku, Trunks, and Pan are on Giru's home planet, goku can sense the ki of the sigma force and they are not androids at all. Don't know what this means about sensing the ki of 17, but just thought it was an interesting fact that may be relevant to sensing 17's ki. Khorikoshi, 22:35, 30 November 2006 PST</p>
<dl>
<dd>The sigma force were "machine mutants". they were some sort of biological lifeform that had been altered to have mechanical properties. does this mean they were still living things? that was never explained.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarhawkman_ce32.html" title="User:Marhawkman">Marhawkman</a> 01:41, 15 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Biological <b>life</b>form! That still means living thing! Having mechanical properties doesn't mean turning completely mechanical. 63.215.29.185 21:42, 14 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Which is my point exactly. 17 and 18 are Cyborgs, thus they are at least part biological. (and thus have some ki)--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarhawkman_ce32.html" title="User:Marhawkman">Marhawkman</a> 12:27, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Shouldn't there be a section in the article talking about 17's abilities?

<p>In the origional Japanese version of the anime, No.17 wonders why Dr.Gero would go backwards and make andriods from human bases when he had previously made No.16 from nothing. It is later revealed that Cell can absorb them because they are organic, thus implying that Gero created 17 and 18 to be absorbed by Cell. I'm not sure if anything like this is stated in the manga so could anyon possibly check on that?</p>

<p>i think he made 17 and 18 orignaly to kill goku but when they wouldnt obey him he made cell to absorbeb them <a href="../../../s/a/i/User%7ESailor_cuteness_84a5.html" title="User:Sailor cuteness">sailor cuteness-ready for love</a> 19:37, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
