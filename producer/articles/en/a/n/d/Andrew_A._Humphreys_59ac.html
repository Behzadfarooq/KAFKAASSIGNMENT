<p>Humphreys was born in <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia%2C_Pennsylvania_7d25.html" title="Philadelphia, Pennsylvania">Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</a>, to a family prominent in naval architecture; his grandfather, Joshua, designed "Old Ironsides", the <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Constitution_26ac.html" title="USS Constitution">USS <i>Constitution</i></a>. Andrew graduated from the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Military_Academy_8e07.html" title="U.S. Military Academy">U.S. Military Academy</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/3/1831.html" title="1831">1831</a> and spent much of the next thirty years as a civil engineer in the Army.

<p>After the outbreak of the Civil War, Humphreys was promoted (<a href="../../../a/u/g/August_6.html" title="August 6">August 6</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1861.html" title="1861">1861</a>) to <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major.html" title="Major">major</a> and became chief topographical engineer in <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_General_811b.html" title="Major General">Maj. Gen.</a> <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_B._McClellan_d12c.html" title="George B. McClellan">George B. McClellan</a>'s Army of the Potomac. Initially involved in planning the defenses of <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_D.C._323f.html" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, by March 1862, he shipped out with McClellan for the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Peninsula_Campaign_ba2d.html" title="Peninsula Campaign">Peninsula Campaign</a>. He was promoted to <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigadier_general.html" title="Brigadier general">brigadier general</a> of volunteers on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_28.html" title="April 28">April 28</a> and on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_12.html" title="September 12">September 12</a> assumed command of the new 3rd Division in the <a href="../../../v/_/c/V_Corps_%28ACW%29_a5c9.html" title="V Corps (ACW)">V Corps</a> of the Army of the Potomac. He led the division in a reserve role in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Antietam_e90e.html" title="Battle of Antietam">Battle of Antietam</a>. At the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Fredericksburg_aa81.html" title="Battle of Fredericksburg">Battle of Fredericksburg</a>, his division achieved the farthest advance against fierce <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederate_States_Army_46d5.html" title="Confederate States Army">Confederate</a> fire from Marye's Heights; his corps commander, Maj. Gen. <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_G._Meade_1d67.html" title="George G. Meade">George G. Meade</a>, wrote: "He behaved with distinguished gallantry at Fredericksburg." For an officer with little combat experience, he inspired his troops with his personal bravery. Historian Larry Tagg wrote:</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>... for certain good reasons connected with the effect of what I did upon the spirit of the men and from an invincible repugnance to ride anywhere else, I always rode at the head of my troops." Lt. Cavada of the general's staff recalled that just before he took his troops up to the Stone Wall at Fredericksburg, Humphreys had bowed to his staff in his courtly way, "and in the blandest manner remarked, 'Young gentlemen, I intend to lead this assault; I presume, of course, you will wish to ride with me?'" Since it was put like that, the staff had done so, and five of the seven officers were knocked off their horses. After his men had taken as much as they could stand in front of the Stone Wall on Marye's Heights, the next brigade coming up the hill saw Humphreys sitting his horse all alone, looking out across the plain, bullets cutting the air all around him. Something about the way the general was taking it pleased them, and they sent up a cheer. Humphreys looked over, surprised, waved his cap to them with a grim smile, and then went riding off into the twilight. In this way Humphreys had turned his first division's dislike of him into admiration for his heroic leadership ...</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">– <cite style="font-style:normal;">Larry Tagg, <i>Generals of Gettysburg</i></cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although respected by his men for his bravery under fire, Humphreys was not well liked by them. In his mid-fifties, they considered him an old man, despite his relatively youthful appearance. His nickname was "Old Goggle Eyes" for his eyeglasses. He was a taskmaster and strict disciplinarian. <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Anderson_Dana_9062.html" title="Charles Anderson Dana">Charles A. Dana</a>, the Assistant <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Secretary_of_War_e0d8.html" title="United States Secretary of War">Secretary of War</a>, called him a man of "distinguished and brilliant profanity."</p>

<p>At the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Chancellorsville_6ca4.html" title="Battle of Chancellorsville">Battle of Chancellorsville</a>, Humphreys' division did little, principally because most of his soldiers were near the ends of their enlistments. On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_23.html" title="May 23">May 23</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1863.html" title="1863">1863</a>, Humphreys was transferred to the command of the 2nd Division in the <a href="../../../i/i/i/III_Corps_%28ACW%29_874a.html" title="III Corps (ACW)">III Corps</a>, under Maj. Gen. <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_E._Sickles_ee78.html" title="Daniel E. Sickles">Daniel E. Sickles</a>. When Meade assumed command of the Army of the Potomac just before the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Gettysburg_849f.html" title="Battle of Gettysburg">Battle of Gettysburg</a>, he asked Humphreys to be his chief of staff, replacing Maj. Gen. <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Butterfield_f61a.html" title="Daniel Butterfield">Daniel Butterfield</a>, who was considered to be too close politically to the previous commander, Maj. Gen. <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Hooker_211f.html" title="Joseph Hooker">Joseph Hooker</a>. Humphreys declined the opportunity to give up his division command. His new division immediately saw action at Gettysburg where, on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_2.html" title="July 2">July 2</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1863.html" title="1863">1863</a>, Sickles insubordinately moved his corps from its assigned defensive position on Cemetery Ridge. Humphrey's new position was on the Emmitsburg Road, part of a salient directly in the path of the Confederate assault, and it was too long a front for a single division to defend. Assaulted by the division of Maj. Gen. <a href="../../../l/a/f/Lafayette_McLaws_1cad.html" title="Lafayette McLaws">Lafayette McLaws</a>, Humphrey's two brigades were demolished; Sickles had pulled back Humphrey's reserve brigade to shore up the neighboring division (Maj. Gen. <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_B._Birney_7408.html" title="David B. Birney">David B. Birney</a>), which was the first to be attacked. Humphreys put up the best fight that could have been expected and was eventually able to reform his survivors on Cemetery Ridge, but his division and the entire corps were finished as a fighting force.</p>
<p>Humphreys was promoted to major general of volunteers on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_8.html" title="July 8">July 8</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1863.html" title="1863">1863</a>, and finally acceded to Meade's request to serve as his chief of staff; he did not have much of a division left to command. He served in that position through the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristoe_Campaign_c798.html" title="Bristoe Campaign">Bristoe</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mine_Run_Campaign_48c1.html" title="Mine Run Campaign">Mine Run</a> campaigns that fall, and the <a href="../../../o/v/e/Overland_Campaign_5734.html" title="Overland Campaign">Overland Campaign</a> and the <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siege_of_Petersburg_a701.html" title="Siege of Petersburg">Siege of Petersburg</a> in 1864.

In retirement, Humphreys studied philosophy. He was one of the incorporators of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Academy_of_Sciences_baad.html" title="National Academy of Sciences">National Academy of Sciences</a>. Humphreys' published works were highlighted by his 1867 <i>Report on the Physics and Hydraulics of the Mississippi River</i>, which gave him considerable prominence in the scientific community. He also wrote personal accounts of the war, published in 1883: <i>From Gettysburg to the Rapidan</i> and <i>The Virginia Campaign of '64 and '65</i>. He died in Washington, D.C., and is buried there in the Congressional Cemetery.</p>
