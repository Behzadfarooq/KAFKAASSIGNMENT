<p>Much of the fighting in World War I took place along the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Front_%28WWI%29_a0c8.html" title="Western Front (WWI)">Western Front</a>, embodied within a system of opposing manned trenches and fortifications (separated by a “<a href="../../../n/o/_/No_man%27s_land.html" title="No man's land">No man's land</a>”) running from the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Sea_f231.html" title="North Sea">North Sea</a> to the border of Switzerland. On the <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Front_%28WWI%29_184a.html" title="Eastern Front (WWI)">Eastern Front</a>, the two sides battled on just as great a scale, but the vast eastern plains and limited rail network prevented a trench warfare stalemate from developing. Hostilities were also prosecuted by fighting on and under the sea and — for the first time — from the air. More than 9 million soldiers died on the various battlefields, and nearly that many more in the participating countries' home fronts on account of food shortages and <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genocide.html" title="Genocide">genocide</a> committed under the cover of various civil wars and internal conflicts.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyZ_World_War_I_9ac1.html" title="Edit section: Sole responsibility of Germany and Austria">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Sole responsibility of Germany and Austria</span></h4>
<p>This “official” explanation appeared in Article 231 of the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Versailles_58e2.html" title="Treaty of Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a> in 1919, often referred to as the <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_Guilt_Clause_9679.html" title="War Guilt Clause">War Guilt</a> Clause. The argument was based on the fact that Austria attacked Serbia on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_29.html" title="July 29">July 29</a> and Germany invaded Belgium on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_3.html" title="August 3">August 3</a>.<a href="http://cnparm.home.texas.net/Wars/JulyCrisis/JulyCrisis04.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://cnparm.home.texas.net/Wars/JulyCrisis/JulyCrisis04.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Thus, the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires were seen to be the initial aggressors and therefore, responsible for the war. Some of Germany's allies, with the help of Allied propaganda, even became convinced that they were fighting "Germany's war".</p>
<p>German academics such as <a href="../../../f/r/i/Fritz_Fischer_a268.html" title="Fritz Fischer">Fritz Fischer</a>, Imanuel Geiss, <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hans-Ulrich_Wehler_f037.html" title="Hans-Ulrich Wehler">Hans-Ulrich Wehler</a>, <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolfgang_Mommsen_6bc5.html" title="Wolfgang Mommsen">Wolfgang Mommsen</a> and V.R. Berghahn have all promoted the thesis, to various degrees, in the post-World War II period. Fischer contended that Germany wanted to control most of Europe or, at the very least, unite it economically <i>through</i> Germany. However, as he points out, diplomatic efforts to do so had often centered around Anglo-Germanic cooperation, not war.</p>
<p>It has been argued that Germany was the European power most prone to start a general European war, by virtue of geography. Each of the other great powers of Europe had a convenient outlet for imperial expansion: France could seek colonies across the Mediterranean in <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Africa_6a9e.html" title="North Africa">North Africa</a>, Austria could expand in the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balkans.html" title="Balkans">Balkans</a> towards the <a href="../../../a/e/g/Aegean_Sea_b508.html" title="Aegean Sea">Aegean Sea</a>, Russia could develop its recently-acquired holdings in <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Asia_5707.html" title="Central Asia">Central Asia</a> and the <a href="../../../f/a/r/Far_East_982f.html" title="Far East">Far East</a>, perhaps later adding <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchuria.html" title="Manchuria">Manchuria</a>, while Britain could seek colonies in almost any part of the world, owing to its domination of the high seas. By contrast, Germany was hemmed in between the great powers of France, Austria and Russia, and could only base a navy in the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Sea_f231.html" title="North Sea">North Sea</a>, which would be seen by Britain as a direct menace to the British Isles. Gordon Corrigan makes this case in his book <i>Mud, Blood and Poppycock: Britain and the First World War.</i></p>

<p>In the late 1920s and 30s, many people felt that the war was an accident that no one had foreseen or intended. In this interpretation, events had simply gotten out of control. This implied that something had to be done to prevent future accidental catastrophes. The nations involved in the war responded by setting up the <a href="../../../l/e/a/League_of_Nations_d214.html" title="League of Nations">League of Nations</a>, signing the <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kellogg-Briand_Pact_04d9.html" title="Kellogg-Briand Pact">Kellogg-Briand Pact</a>, passing <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neutrality_acts.html" title="Neutrality acts">neutrality acts</a> and engaging in <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeasement.html" title="Appeasement">appeasement</a> to settle disputes.</p>

<p>The naval arms race between Germany and Great Britain was drastically intensified by the 1906 launch of the <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Dreadnought_%281906%29_114f.html" title="HMS Dreadnought (1906)">HMS Dreadnought</a>, a revolutionary battleship that rendered all previous battleships obsolete. This weakened Britain’s relative power as a seafaring nation, as the new type of vessel opened up a new chapter in naval warfare, annihilating the old <i>status-quo</i>. Consequently, a major naval <a href="../../../a/r/m/Arms_race.html" title="Arms race">arms race</a> in shipbuilding developed, tying in with the concept of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_imperialism.html" title="New imperialism">new imperialism</a>, furthering the interest in alliances. <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Kennedy_acb0.html" title="Paul Kennedy">Paul Kennedy</a> has promulgated the thesis that both nations adopted <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Thayer_Mahan_3245.html" title="Alfred Thayer Mahan">Alfred T. Mahan</a>’s conclusion that control of the oceans was vital to a great nation. Additionally, this concentration kept related industries active and unemployment down while minimizing internal strife through the focus on a common, patriotic goal.</p>
<p><a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Stevenson_7a37.html" title="David Stevenson">David Stevenson</a> described the armaments race as “a self-reinforcing cycle of heightened military preparedness”, while David Herrmann viewed the shipbuilding rivalry as part of a general movement towards war. However, <a href="../../../n/i/a/Niall_Ferguson_3db7.html" title="Niall Ferguson">Niall Ferguson</a> argues that Britain’s ability to maintain an overall advantage signifies that change within this realm was insignificant and therefore, not a factor in the movement towards war.</p>

<p>Closely related is the thesis adopted by many political scientists that the war plans of Germany, France and Russia automatically escalated the conflict. Fritz Fischer and his followers have emphasized the inherently aggressive nature of Germany’s <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schlieffen_Plan_9ebc.html" title="Schlieffen Plan">Schlieffen Plan</a>, which outlined German strategy if at war with both France and Russia. Conflict on two fronts meant that Germany had to eliminate one opponent quickly before taking on the other, relying on a strict timetable. Germany’s strategy called for a strong right flank on the attack on Belgium, conquer and crush French mobilizations to cripple the French army. After the attack, the German army would then be rushed to the eastern front through railroads and quickly destroy the slow, but would-be unstoppable military mobilization. Unfortunately, things did not end up as planned, and the beginning mistakes would cost Germany the war. France’s well defended border with Germany meant that an attack through Belgian (and possibly Dutch) territory was a necessity, creating a number of unexpected problems. In a greater context, France’s own <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plan_XVII_93a4.html" title="Plan XVII">Plan XVII</a> called for an offensive thrust into Germany’s industrial <a href="../../../r/u/h/Ruhr_Valley_3918.html" title="Ruhr Valley">Ruhr Valley</a>, crippling Germany’s ability to wage war. Russia’s revised Plan XIX implied a mobilization of its armies against both Austria-Hungary and Germany. All three created an atmosphere where generals and planning staffs were anxious to take the initiative and seize decisive victories. Elaborate mobilization plans with precise timetables had been prepared. Once the mobilization orders were issued, it was understood by both generals and statesmen alike that there was little or no possibility of turning back or a key advantage would be sacrificed. Furthermore, the problem of communications in 1914 should not be underestimated; all nations still used <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telegraphy.html" title="Telegraphy">telegraphy</a> and ambassadors as the main form of communication, which resulted in delays from hours to even days.</p>

<p>President of the United States <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woodrow_Wilson_eb76.html" title="Woodrow Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> and other observers blamed the war on <a href="../../../m/i/l/Militarism.html" title="Militarism">militarism</a>. The idea was that aristocrats and military elites had too much control over Germany, Russia and Austria, and the war was a consequence of their thirst for military power and disdain for <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democracy.html" title="Democracy">democracy</a>. This was a theme that figured prominently in anti-German propaganda, which cast Kaiser <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilhelm_II_4866.html" title="Wilhelm II">Wilhelm II</a> and Prussian military tradition in a negative light. Consequently, supporters of this theory called for the abdication of such rulers, the end of the aristocratic system and the end of militarism—all of which justified American entry into the war once Czarist Russia dropped out of the Allied camp. Wilson hoped the <a href="../../../l/e/a/League_of_Nations_d214.html" title="League of Nations">League of Nations</a> and universal disarmament would secure a lasting peace. He also acknowledged variations of militarism that, in his opinion, existed within the British and French political systems.</p>

<p><a href="../../../l/e/n/Lenin.html" title="Lenin">Lenin</a> famously asserted that the worldwide system of <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperialism.html" title="Imperialism">imperialism</a> was responsible for the war. In this he drew upon the economic theories of English economist <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_A._Hobson_0d08.html" title="John A. Hobson">John A. Hobson</a>, who, in his 1902 book entitled “Imperialism”<a href="http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1902hobson.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1902hobson.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, had earlier predicted the outcome of economic imperialism, or unlimited competition for expanding markets, would lead to a global military conflict. This argument proved persuasive in the immediate wake of the war and assisted in the rise of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marxism.html" title="Marxism">Marxism</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">Communism</a>. Lenin’s 1917 pamphlet “Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism” <a href="http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> made the argument, specifically, that large banking interests in the various capitalist-imperialist powers had pulled the strings in the various governments and led them into the war.</p>

<p>The civilian leaders of the European powers found themselves facing a wave of <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalism.html" title="Nationalism">nationalist</a> zeal that had been building across Europe for years, as memories of war faded or were convoluted into a <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanticism.html" title="Romanticism">romantic</a> fantasy that resonated in the public conscience. Frantic diplomatic efforts to mediate the Austrian-Serbian quarrel simply became irrelevant, as public and elite opinion commonly demanded war to uphold national honor. Most of the belligerents envisioned swift victory and glorious consequences. The patriotic enthusiasm, unity and ultimate euphoria that took hold during the <i><a href="../../../s/p/i/Spirit_of_1914.html" title="Spirit of 1914">Spirit of 1914</a></i> was full of that very optimism regarding the postwar future. Also, the Socialist-Democratic movement had begun to exert pressure on aristocrats throughout Europe, who optimistically hoped that victory would reunite their countries via the consolidation of their domestic hegemony. However, <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horatio_Kitchener_644e.html" title="Horatio Kitchener">Lord Kitchener</a> and <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erich_Ludendorff_40ad.html" title="Erich Ludendorff">Erich Ludendorff</a> were among those who predicted that modern, industrialized warfare would be a lengthy excursion. Others, such as <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theobald_von_Bethmann-Hollweg_bd19.html" title="Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg">Bethmann Hollweg</a>, were concerned by the potential social consequences of a war. International bond and financial markets entered severe crises in late July and early August reflecting worry about the financial consequences of war. Nevertheless, spurred on by propaganda and nationalist fervor, many eagerly joined the ranks in search of adventure.</p>

The Serbian government accepted all the terms, except that of the participation of the Austrian agents in the inquiry, which it saw as a violation of its sovereignty. Breaking diplomatic relations, the Austro-Hungarian Empire declared war on Serbia on July 28 and proceeded to bombard Belgrade on July 29. On July 30, Austria-Hungary and Russia both ordered general mobilization of their armies.</p>
<p>The Germans, having pledged their support to Austria-Hungary, sent Russia an ultimatum on July 31 to stop mobilization within 12 hours. The same day, <a href="../../../r/a/o/Raoul_Villain_36d1.html" title="Raoul Villain">Raoul Villain</a> assassinated <a href="../../../s/e/c/Section_fran%C3%A7aise_de_l%27Internationale_ouvri%C3%A8re_d39d.html" title="Section française de l'Internationale ouvrière">SFIO socialist leader</a> <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Jaur%C3%A8s_bb4f.html" title="Jean Jaurès">Jean Jaurès</a>, one of the only French figures who could stop the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-militarist.html" title="Anti-militarist">anti-militarist</a> <a href="../../../w/o/r/Workers%27_movement.html" title="Workers' movement">workers' movement</a> from taking part in the war. On August 1, with the ultimatum expired, the German ambassador to Russia formally declared war. On August 2, Germany occupied Luxembourg, as a preliminary step to the invasion of Belgium and the <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schlieffen_Plan_9ebc.html" title="Schlieffen Plan">Schlieffen Plan</a> (Germany had planned to attack France first according to the plan, and then Russia, which had already gone wrong). The same day, yet another ultimatum was delivered to Belgium, requesting free passage for the German army on the way to France. The Belgians refused. At the very last moment, the Kaiser <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilhelm_II_of_Germany_a896.html" title="Wilhelm II of Germany">Wilhelm II</a> asked <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helmuth_von_Moltke_the_Younger_1e07.html" title="Helmuth von Moltke the Younger">Moltke</a>, the German Chief of General Staff, to cancel the invasion of France in the hope this would keep Britain out of the war. Moltke, horrified by the prospect of the utter ruin of the Schlieffen Plan, refused on the grounds that it would be impossible to change the rail schedule—“once settled, it cannot be altered” <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>. The question of whether such a radical change in Germany’s plans would have indeed been possible was the subject of much dispute. When Moltke’s reply was revealed after the war to General von Staab, Germany’s Chief of the Railway Division, he saw it as an affront to the capabilities of his unit, and proceeded to write a book proving such a change was indeed possible<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>. On August 3, Germany declared war on France and invaded Belgium on August 4. This act—violating Belgian neutrality to which Germany, France, and Britain were all committed to guarantee—gave Britain, which up to that point had yet to choose a side in the conflict, a reason to declare war on Germany on August 4. <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthias_Erzberger_9f7e.html" title="Matthias Erzberger">Matthias Erzberger</a>, the Reichstag deputy, later testified that six months after the outbreak of war, Moltke admitted that attacking France first was a mistake and that “the larger part of our army ought first to have been sent to the East to smash the Russian steamroller” <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>In Europe, the Central Powers—the German Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire—suffered from mutual miscommunication and lack of intelligence regarding the intentions of each other’s army. Germany had originally guaranteed to support Austria-Hungary’s invasion of Serbia but practical interpretation of this idea differed. Austro-Hungarian leaders believed Germany would cover the northern flank against Russia. Germany, however, had planned for Austria-Hungary to focus the majority of its troops on Russia while Germany dealt with France on the Western Front. This confusion forced the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austro-Hungarian_army_70bc.html" title="Austro-Hungarian army">Austro-Hungarian army</a> to split its troop concentrations. Somewhat more than half of the army went to fight the Russians on their border, and the remainder was allocated to invade and conquer Serbia.</p>

<p>The Serbian army fought a defensive battle against the invading Austrian army (called the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Cer_9cd1.html" title="Battle of Cer">Battle of Cer</a>) starting on August 12. The Serbians occupied defensive positions on the south side of the <a href="../../../d/r/i/Drina.html" title="Drina">Drina</a> and Save rivers. Over the next two weeks Austrian attacks were thrown back with heavy losses. This marked the first major Allied victory of the war. Austrian expectations of a swift victory over Serbia were not realized and as a result, Austria had to keep a very sizable force on the Serbian front, which weakened their armies facing Russia.</p>

<p>After entering Belgian territory, the German army soon encountered resistance at a fortified <a href="../../../l/i/%C3%A8/Li%C3%A8ge_%28city%29.html" title="Liège (city)">Liège</a>. Although the army as a whole continued to make rapid progress into France, the German invasion forced Britain’s decision to intervene on the side of the Allies. As a signatory of the 1839 <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_London%2C_1839_b93b.html" title="Treaty of London, 1839">Treaty of London</a>, Great Britain was committed to the preservation of a neutral and independent Belgium. In British eyes, the ports of Antwerp and Ostend were deemed too important to be possessed by a hostile continental power. <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> Britain sent an army to France (the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Expeditionary_Force_ffa2.html" title="British Expeditionary Force">British Expeditionary Force</a>, or BEF) which advanced into Belgium and slowed the Germans. The first British soldier killed in the war was <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Parr_%28soldier%29_87ff.html" title="John Parr (soldier)">John Parr</a>, on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_21.html" title="August 21">August 21</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1914.html" title="1914">1914</a>, near Mons.</p>
<p>Initially, the Germans had great successes in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Frontiers_fdfd.html" title="Battle of the Frontiers">Battle of the Frontiers</a> (14–<a href="../../../a/u/g/August_24.html" title="August 24">24 August</a> <a href="../../../1/9/1/1914.html" title="1914">1914</a>). However, Russia attacked in <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Prussia_9913.html" title="East Prussia">East Prussia</a> and diverted German forces intended for the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Front_%28WWI%29_a0c8.html" title="Western Front (WWI)">Western Front</a>. Germany defeated Russia in a series of battles collectively known as the Second <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Tannenberg_%281914%29_2475.html" title="Battle of Tannenberg (1914)">Battle of Tannenberg</a> (August 17–September 2). This diversion exacerbated problems of insufficient speed of advance from railheads not allowed for by the German <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Staff_5387.html" title="General Staff">General Staff</a>. Originally, the Schlieffen Plan called for the right flank of the German advance to pass to the west of Paris. However, the capacity of rail and surface roads hampered the German supply train, allowing French and British forces to finally halt the German advance east of Paris at the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Battle_of_the_Marne_df2d.html" title="First Battle of the Marne">First Battle of the Marne</a> (September 1914, thereby denying the Central Powers a quick victory over France and forcing them to fight a war on two fronts. The German army had fought its way into a good defensive position inside France and had permanently incapacitated 230,000 more French and British troops than it had lost itself in the months of August and September. Yet staff incompetence and leadership timidity (such as <a href="../../../m/o/l/Moltke_the_Younger_7d13.html" title="Moltke the Younger">Moltke the Younger</a> needlessly transferring troops from the right to protect <a href="../../../s/e/d/Sedan%2C_France_ec49.html" title="Sedan, France">Sedan</a>) cost Germany the chance for an early victory over France with its very ambitious war plan.</p>

<p>Advances in military technology meant that defensive firepower outweighed offensive capabilities, making the war particularly murderous, as tactics had failed to keep up. <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbed_wire.html" title="Barbed wire">Barbed wire</a> was a significant hindrance to massed infantry advances; <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artillery.html" title="Artillery">artillery</a>, now vastly more lethal than in the 1870s, coupled with <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machine_gun.html" title="Machine gun">machine guns</a>, made crossing open ground a nightmarish prospect. Germans began using <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poison_gas_in_World_War_I_7c80.html" title="Poison gas in World War I">poison gas</a> in 1915, and soon, both sides were using gas. Neither side ever won a battle with gas, but it made life even more miserable in the trenches and became one of the most feared, and longest remembered, horrors of the war. Unfortunately, few drastic changes in tactics could have been made even if the military leaders of the time were open to them. The war saw the invention of <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tank.html" title="Tank">tanks</a> as another attempt to break the trench warfare stalemate. They were primarily used by the British and French, though the Germans used captured Allied tanks and a small number of their own design.</p>
<p>After the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Battle_of_the_Marne_df2d.html" title="First Battle of the Marne">First Battle of the Marne</a>, both Entente and German forces began a series of outflanking maneuvres to try to force the other to retreat, in the so-called <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_to_the_Sea_ba5d.html" title="Race to the Sea">Race to the Sea</a>. Britain and France soon found themselves facing entrenched German positions from <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lorraine_%28province%29.html" title="Lorraine (province)">Lorraine</a> to Belgium’s <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flanders.html" title="Flanders">Flemish</a> coast. Britain and France sought to take the offensive, while Germany defended occupied territories. One consequence was that German trenches were much better constructed than those of their enemy: Anglo-French trenches were only intended to be “temporary” before their forces broke through German defences. Some hoped to break the stalemate by utilizing science and technology. In April 1915, the Germans used <a href="../../../c/h/l/Chlorine_gas.html" title="Chlorine gas">chlorine gas</a>, for the first time, which opened a 6 kilometer (4&#160;mi) wide hole in the Allied lines when French colonial troops retreated before it.

Around 800,000 soldiers from the British Empire were on the Western Front at any one time. 1,000 battalions, each occupying a sector of the line from the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Sea_f231.html" title="North Sea">North Sea</a> to the <a href="../../../o/r/n/Orne_River_%28Lorraine%29_e1b7.html" title="Orne River (Lorraine)">Orne River</a>, operated on a month-long four-stage rotation system, unless an offensive was underway. The front contained over 9,600 kilometers (6,000&#160;mi) of trenches. Each battalion held its sector for about a week before moving back to support lines and then further back to the reserve lines before a week out-of-line, often in the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Poperinge.html" title="Poperinge">Poperinge</a> or <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amiens.html" title="Amiens">Amiens</a> areas.</p>

<p>The Russian commander from 1915 to 1916, General <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikolai_Nikolaevich_Yudenich_a7bf.html" title="Nikolai Nikolaevich Yudenich">Yudenich</a>, with a string of victories over the Ottoman forces, drove the Turks out of much of present-day <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenia.html" title="Armenia">Armenia</a>, and tragically provided a context for the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Deportation.html" title="Deportation">deportation</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Genocide_187a.html" title="Armenian Genocide">genocide</a> against the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenians.html" title="Armenians">Armenian</a> population in eastern Armenia.</p>

<p><a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a> had been allied to the German and Austro-Hungarian Empires since 1882. Italy had its own designs against Austrian territory in the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trentino.html" title="Trentino">Trentino</a>, <a href="../../../i/s/t/Istria.html" title="Istria">Istria</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dalmatia.html" title="Dalmatia">Dalmatia</a>, and maintained a secret 1902 understanding with France, which effectively nullified its alliance commitments. Italy refused to join Germany and Austria-Hungary at the beginning of the war because their alliance was defensive. The Austrian government started negotiations to obtain Italian neutrality in exchange for French territories (<a href="../../../t/u/n/Tunisia.html" title="Tunisia">Tunisia</a>), but Italy joined the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triple_Entente_f747.html" title="Triple Entente">Entente</a> by signing the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Pact_f861.html" title="London Pact">London Pact</a> in April and declaring war on Austria-Hungary in May 1915; it declared war against Germany fifteen months later.</p>
<p>In general, the Italians had numerical superiority but were poorly equipped. The Italians went on the offensive to relieve pressure on the other Allied fronts and achieve their territorial goals. In the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trentino-South_Tyrol_c812.html" title="Trentino-South Tyrol">Trentino</a> front, the Austro-Hungarian defence took advantage of the elevation of their bases in the mostly <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mountainous.html" title="Mountainous">mountainous</a> terrain, which was not suitable for military offensives. After an initial Austro-Hungaric strategic retreat to better positions, the front remained mostly unchanged, while Austrian Kaiserschützen and Standschützen and Italian <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpini_Corps_7e80.html" title="Alpini Corps">Alpini</a> fought bitter close combat battles during summer and tried to survive during winter in the high mountains. The Austro-Hungarians counterattacked in the <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asiago.html" title="Asiago">Altopiano of Asiago</a> towards Verona and Padua in the spring of 1916 (<i>Strafexpedition</i>), but they also made little progress.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1915, the Italians mounted 11 major offensives along the Isonzo river north of <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trieste.html" title="Trieste">Trieste</a>, known as the First through Eleventh Battles of the <a href="../../../s/o/%C4%8D/So%C4%8Da_River_b463.html" title="Soča River">Isonzo</a>. These attacks were repelled by the Austro-Hungarians who had the higher ground. In the summer of 1916, the Italians captured the town of <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gorizia.html" title="Gorizia">Gorizia</a>. After this minor victory, the front remained practically stable for over a year, despite several Italian offensives. In the fall of 1917, thanks to the improving situation on the Eastern front, the Austrians received large reinforcements, including German assault troops. The Central Powers launched a crushing offensive on October the 26th that was spearheaded by German troops and supported by the Austrians and Hungarians. The attack resulted in the victory of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Caporetto_b8fa.html" title="Battle of Caporetto">Caporetto</a>: the Italian army was routed, but after retreating more than 100km, it was able to reorganise and hold at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Piave_River_def5.html" title="Battle of the Piave River">Piave River</a>. In 1918, the Austrians repeatedly failed to break the Italian line, and, decisively defeated in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Vittorio_Veneto_0655.html" title="Battle of Vittorio Veneto">Battle of Vittorio Veneto</a>, surrendered to the Entente powers in November.</p>

<p>Faced with the Russian threat, Austria-Hungary could spare only one third of its army for <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbia.html" title="Serbia">Serbia</a>. After suffering tremendous losses, the Austrians briefly captured the Serbian capital, but Serb counterattacks succeeded in expelling the invaders from the country by the end of 1914. For the first 10 months of 1915. Austria used most of its spare armies to fight Italy. However, German and Austria diplomats scored a great coup by convincing <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgaria.html" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> to join in a new attack on Serbia.</p>
<p>The conquest of Serbia was finally accomplished in a little more than a month, starting on October 7, when the Austrians and Germans attacked from the north. Four days later the Bulgarians attacked from the east. The Serbian army, attacked from two directions and facing certain defeat, retreated east and south into <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albania.html" title="Albania">Albania</a>, and then by ship to <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greece</a>. In late 1915, a Franco-British force landed at <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salonica.html" title="Salonica">Salonica</a> in Greece to offer assistance and to pressure the Greek government into war against the Central Powers. Unfortunately for the Allies, the pro-Allied Greek government of <a href="../../../e/l/e/Eleftherios_Venizelos_7963.html" title="Eleftherios Venizelos">Eleftherios Venizelos</a> was dismissed, by the pro-German <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantine_I_of_Greece_6a4d.html" title="Constantine I of Greece">King Constantine I</a>, before the allied expeditionary force had even arrived.</p>
<p>The Salonica Front proved entirely immobile, so much so that it was joked that Salonica was the largest German <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_war.html" title="Prisoner of war">prisoner of war</a> camp. Only at the very end of the war were the Entente powers able to make a breakthrough, which was after most of the German and Austro-Hungarian troops had been removed, leaving the Front held by the Bulgarians alone. This led to Bulgaria’s signing an <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armistice.html" title="Armistice">armistice</a> on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_29.html" title="September 29">September 29</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a>.</p>

<p>While the Western Front had reached stalemate in the trenches, the war continued in the east. The Russian initial plans for war had called for simultaneous invasions of Austrian <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galicia_%28Central_Europe%29_3dcc.html" title="Galicia (Central Europe)">Galicia</a> and German <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Prussia_9913.html" title="East Prussia">East Prussia</a>.

Russia’s less developed industrial base and ineffective military leadership was instrumental in the events that unfolded. By the spring of 1915, the Russians were driven back in Galicia, and in May, the Central Powers achieved a remarkable breakthrough on <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a>’s southern fringes, capturing <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warsaw.html" title="Warsaw">Warsaw</a> on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_5.html" title="August 5">August 5</a> and forcing the Russians to withdraw from all of Poland.

<p>Events of 1917 would prove decisive in ending the war, although their effects would not be fully felt until 1918. The British naval blockade of Germany began to have a serious impact on morale and productivity on the German home front. In response, in February 1917, the German General Staff (<a href="../../../o/b/e/Oberste_Heeresleitung_31ea.html" title="Oberste Heeresleitung">OHL</a>) was able to convince <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chancellor.html" title="Chancellor">Chancellor</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theobald_von_Bethmann-Hollweg_bd19.html" title="Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg">Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg</a> to declare <a href="../../../u/n/r/Unrestricted_submarine_warfare.html" title="Unrestricted submarine warfare">unrestricted submarine warfare</a>, with the goal of starving Britain out of the war.

After July, the reintroduced <a href="../../../c/o/n/Convoy.html" title="Convoy">convoy</a> system was extremely effective in neutralizing the <a href="../../../u/-/b/U-boat.html" title="U-boat">U-boat</a> threat, thanks to American experimentation. Britain was safe from the threat of starvation, and the German war industry remained deprived materially.</p>
<p>The decisive victory of Germany at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Caporetto_b8fa.html" title="Battle of Caporetto">Battle of Caporetto</a> led to the Allied decision at the <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rapallo_Conference_1f7d.html" title="Rapallo Conference">Rapallo Conference</a> to form the Supreme Allied Council at <a href="../../../v/e/r/Versailles.html" title="Versailles">Versailles</a> to coordinate plans and action. Previously British and French armies had operated under separate command systems.</p>
<p>In December, the Central Powers signed an armistice with Russia, thereby releasing troops from the eastern front for use in the west. Ironically, German troop transfers could have been greater if their territorial acquisitions had not been so dramatic. With both German reinforcements and new <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> troops pouring into the Western Front, the final outcome of the war was to be decided in that front. The Central Powers knew that they could not win a protracted war now that American forces were certain to be arriving in increasing numbers, but they held high hopes for a rapid offensive in the West using their reinforced troops and new infantry tactics. Furthermore, the rulers of both the Central Powers and the Allies became more fearful of the threat first raised by <a href="../../../i/v/a/Ivan_Bloch_8a90.html" title="Ivan Bloch">Ivan Bloch</a> in 1899, that protracted industrialized war threatened social collapse and revolution throughout Europe. Both sides urgently sought a decisive, rapid victory on the Western Front because they were both fearful of collapse or stalemate.</p>

<p>America’s policy of insisting on neutral rights while also trying to broker a peace resulted in tensions with both Berlin and London. U.S. President <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woodrow_Wilson_eb76.html" title="Woodrow Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> repeatedly warned that he would not tolerate unrestricted submarine warfare, and the Germans repeatedly promised to stop. A proposal to <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> to join the war against the Allies was exposed in February, bringing war closer. (See <a href="../../../z/i/m/Zimmermann_telegram.html" title="Zimmermann telegram">Zimmermann telegram</a>). After further U-boat (German submarines) attacks on American merchant ships, Wilson requested that Congress declare war on Germany, which it did on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_6.html" title="April 6">April 6</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a> (see: <i><a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson_declares_war_on_Germany" class="extiw" title="wikisource:Woodrow_Wilson_declares_war_on_Germany">Woodrow Wilson declares war on Germany</a></i> on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikisource.html" title="Wikisource">Wikisource</a>). The <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._House_of_Representatives_5a56.html" title="U.S. House of Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a> approved the war resolution 373-50, the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Senate_2092.html" title="U.S. Senate">U.S. Senate</a> 82-6, with opposition coming mostly from <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_American_f845.html" title="German American">German American</a> districts.

<p>Although the American contribution to the war was important, particularly in terms of the threat posed by an increasing U.S. infantry presence in Europe, the United States was never formally a member of the Allies but an “Associated Power”. Significant numbers of fresh American troops arrived in Europe in the summer of 1918, and they started arriving at 10,000 per day.</p>

<p>The British and French wanted the United States to send its infantry to reinforce their troops already on the battlelines, and not use scarce shipping to bring over supplies. Thus the Americans primarily used British and French artillery, airplanes and tanks. However, General <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_J._Pershing_797d.html" title="John J. Pershing">John J. Pershing</a>, <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Expeditionary_Force_a109.html" title="American Expeditionary Force">American Expeditionary Force</a> (AEF) commander, refused to break up American units to be used as reinforcements for British Empire and French units (though he did allow <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">African American</a> combat units to be used by the French). Pershing ordered the use of frontal assaults, which had been discarded by that time by British Empire and French commanders as too costly in lives of their troops. To the astonishment of the Allies, the dispirited Germans broke and ran when the Americans came running, and the AEF suffered the lowest casualty rate of any army on the Western Front, with most recorded deaths being attributed to disease.</p>

<p>German General <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erich_Ludendorff_40ad.html" title="Erich Ludendorff">Erich Ludendorff</a> drew up plans (<a href="../../../c/o/d/Code_name.html" title="Code name">codenamed</a> <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Michael_0042.html" title="Operation Michael">Operation Michael</a>) for a 1918 general offensive along the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Front_b785.html" title="Western Front">Western Front</a>. This <a href="../../../s/p/r/Spring_Offensive_dd62.html" title="Spring Offensive">Spring Offensive</a> sought to divide the British Empire and French armies in a series of feints and advances. The German leadership hoped to strike a decisive blow against the enemy before significant United States forces could be deployed. Before the offensive even began, Ludendorff made what may have been a fatal mistake by leaving the elite <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Eighth_Army_045a.html" title="German Eighth Army">Eighth Army</a> in Russia and sending over only a small portion of the German forces from the east to aid the offensive in the west.</p>
<p>Operation Michael opened on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_21.html" title="March 21">March 21</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a>, with an attack against British Empire forces near the rail junction at <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amiens.html" title="Amiens">Amiens</a>. Ludendorff’s intention was to split the British Empire and French armies at this point. German forces achieved an unprecedented advance of 60 kilometers (40 mi). For the first time since 1914, maneuvering was achieved on the battlefield.</p>
<p>British and French trenches were defeated using novel <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infiltration_tactics.html" title="Infiltration tactics">infiltration tactics</a>. Up to this time, attacks had been characterized by long artillery bombardments and continuous-front mass assaults. However, in the Spring Offensive, the German Army used artillery briefly and infiltrated small groups of infantry at weak points, attacking command and logistics areas and surrounding points of serious resistance. These isolated positions were then destroyed by more heavily armed infantry. German success relied greatly on this tactic.</p>
<p>The front line had now moved to within 120 kilometers (75&#160;mi) of Paris. Three super-heavy <a href="../../../k/r/u/Krupp.html" title="Krupp">Krupp</a> <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railway_gun.html" title="Railway gun">railway guns</a> advanced and fired 183 shells on Paris, which caused many Parisians to flee the city. The initial stages of the offensive were so successful that German <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilhelm_II_of_Germany_a896.html" title="Wilhelm II of Germany">Kaiser Wilhelm II</a> declared <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_24.html" title="March 24">March 24</a> a national holiday. Many Germans thought victory was close; however, after heavy fighting, the German offensive was halted. The Germans had brilliant new stormtrooper, or Hutier tactics that avoided the trenches and sent small units on preplanned raids deep behind the lines to control and communication centers. That worked very well, but the Germans, lacking tanks or motorized artillery, were unable to consolidate their positions. The British and French learned that they had to fall back a few miles and the Germans would be disorganized and vulnerable to counterattack.</p>
<p>American divisions, which Pershing had sought to field as an independent force, were assigned to the depleted French and British Empire commands on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_28.html" title="March 28">March 28</a>. A supreme command of Allied forces was created at the Doullens Conference, in which British Field Marshal <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas_Haig_c6f8.html" title="Douglas Haig">Douglas Haig</a> handed control of his forces over to <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferdinand_Foch_3d10.html" title="Ferdinand Foch">Ferdinand Foch</a>.</p>
<p>Following <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Michael_0042.html" title="Operation Michael">Operation Michael</a>, Germany launched <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Georgette_b363.html" title="Operation Georgette">Operation Georgette</a> to the north against the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_channel.html" title="English channel">Channel</a> ports. This was halted by the Allies with less significant territorial gains to Germany. <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_Battle_of_the_Aisne_8dd2.html" title="Third Battle of the Aisne">Operations Blücher and Yorck</a> were then conducted by the German Army to the south, broadly towards Paris. Next, Operation Marne was launched on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_15.html" title="July 15">July 15</a> as an attempt to encircle <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reims.html" title="Reims">Reims</a>, beginning the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Battle_of_the_Marne_a888.html" title="Second Battle of the Marne">Second Battle of the Marne</a>. The resulting Allied counterattack marked their first successful offensive of the war. By <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_20.html" title="July 20">July 20</a>, the Germans were back at their Kaiserschlacht starting lines, having achieved nothing. Following this last phase of the ground war in the West, the German Army never again held the initiative. German casualties between March and April 1918 were 270,000, including many of the highly trained stormtroopers. Their best soldiers were gone just as the Americans started arriving.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Germany was crumbling internally as well. Anti-war marches were a frequent occurrence and morale within the army was at low levels. Industrial output had fallen 53% from 1913.</p>

<p>The Allied counteroffensive, known as the <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hundred_Days_Offensive_25e0.html" title="Hundred Days Offensive">Hundred Days Offensive</a> began on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_8.html" title="August 8">August 8</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a>. The <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Amiens_4086.html" title="Battle of Amiens">Battle of Amiens</a> developed with III Corps <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Fourth_Army_2ea8.html" title="British Fourth Army">Fourth British Army</a> on the left, the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_First_Army_05ef.html" title="French First Army">First French Army</a> on the right, and the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Corps_f2e3.html" title="Canadian Corps">Canadian</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Corps_2625.html" title="Australian Corps">Australian Corps</a> spearheading the offensive in the centre. It involved 414 <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tank.html" title="Tank">tanks</a> of the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_I_%28tank%29_7b73.html" title="Mark I (tank)">Mark IV</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_V_%28tank%29_835d.html#Mark_V_Series" title="Mark V (tank)">Mark V</a> type, and 120,000 men. They advanced as far as 12 kilometers (7&#160;mi) into German-held territory in just seven hours. <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erich_Ludendorff_40ad.html" title="Erich Ludendorff">Erich Ludendorff</a> referred to this day as “the Black Day of the German army”.</p>
<p>The offensive slowed and lost momentum due to supply problems. British units had encountered problems with all but seven tanks and trucks ran out of gas. On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_15.html" title="August 15">August 15</a>, General Haig called a halt and began planning a new offensive in <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert%2C_Somme_4a12.html" title="Albert, Somme">Albert</a>. This <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Battle_of_the_Somme_%281918%29_0cf9.html" title="Second Battle of the Somme (1918)">Second Battle of the Somme</a> began on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_21.html" title="August 21">August 21</a>. Some 130,000 United States troops were involved, along with soldiers from <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Third_Army_d136.html" title="British Third Army">Third</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Fourth_Army_2ea8.html" title="British Fourth Army">Fourth</a> British Armies. It was an overwhelming success for the Allies. The <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Second_Army_959c.html" title="German Second Army">Second German Army</a> was pushed back over a 55 kilometer (34 mi) front. The town of <a href="../../../b/a/p/Bapaume.html" title="Bapaume">Bapaume</a> was captured on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_29.html" title="August 29">August 29</a> and by <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_2.html" title="September 2">September 2</a>, the Germans were on the <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindenburg_Line_01be.html" title="Hindenburg Line">Hindenburg Line</a>, which was the starting point of the war.</p>
<p>The Allied attempt to take the Hindenburg Line (the <a href="../../../m/e/u/Meuse-Argonne_Offensive_23d6.html" title="Meuse-Argonne Offensive">Meuse-Argonne Offensive</a>) began <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_26.html" title="September 26">September 26</a>, as 260,000 American soldiers went “over the top”. All divisions were successful in capturing their initial objectives, except the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._79th_Infantry_Division_87d5.html" title="U.S. 79th Infantry Division">U.S. 79th Infantry Division</a>, which met stiff resistance at <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montfaucon.html" title="Montfaucon">Montfaucon</a> and took an extra day to capture the objective.</p>
<p>By the start of October, it was evident that Germany could no longer mount a successful defense, let alone a counterattack. Numerically on the frontline they were increasingly outnumbered, with the few new recruits too young or too old to be of much help. Rations were cut for men and horses because the food supply was critical. Ludendorff had decided, by <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_1.html" title="October 1">October 1</a>, that Germany had two ways out of the War—total annihilation or an armistice. He recommended the latter to senior German officials at a summit on that very same day. During October, Pershing’s artillery continued to unrelentingly pound the exhausted and bewildered Germans, all along the Meuse-Argonne front. The Allied pressure did not let up until the end of the war.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, news of Germany’s impending military defeat had spread throughout the German Armed forces. The threat of general mutiny was rife. Naval commander Admiral <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reinhard_Scheer_32c4.html" title="Reinhard Scheer">Reinhard Scheer</a> and Ludendorff decided to launch a last ditch attempt to restore the “valour” of the German Navy. Knowing any such action would be vetoed by the government of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Maximilian_of_Baden_1f54.html" title="Prince Maximilian of Baden">Max von Baden</a>, Ludendorff decided not to inform him. Nonetheless, word of the impending assault reached sailors at <a href="../../../k/i/e/Kiel.html" title="Kiel">Kiel</a>. Many rebelled and were arrested, refusing to be part of a naval offensive which they believed to be nothing more than a suicide bid. It was Ludendorff who took the blame for this—the Kaiser dismissed him on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_26.html" title="October 26">October 26</a>.</p>
<p>With power coming into the hands of new men in Berlin, further fighting became impossible. With 6 million German casualties, Germany moved toward peace. <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Maximilian_of_Baden_1f54.html" title="Prince Maximilian of Baden">Prince Max von Baden</a> took charge of the new German government. Negotiations for peace began immediately upon his appointment. In the matter of the German monarchy, he was torn between the idea of a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitutional_monarchy.html" title="Constitutional monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a>—in which he himself was in line for the crown—or a republic.

<p>The collapse of the Central Powers came swiftly.

On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_3.html" title="October 3">October 3</a>, Germany and Austria-Hungary appealed to President Wilson for an immediate armistice.

However, the latter treaty with the Ottoman Empire was followed by strife (the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_Independence_War_73e0.html" title="Turkish Independence War">Turkish Independence War</a>) and a final peace treaty was signed between the Allied Powers and the country that would shortly become the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Turkey_72cd.html" title="Republic of Turkey">Republic of Turkey</a>, at <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Lausanne_64b1.html" title="Treaty of Lausanne">Lausanne</a> on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_24.html" title="July 24">July 24</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/2/1923.html" title="1923">1923</a>.</p>

<p><a href="../../../g/r/o/Gross_Domestic_Product_fa2b.html" title="Gross Domestic Product">Gross Domestic Product</a> (GDP) increased for three Allies (Britain, Italy, and U.S.), but decreased in France and Russia, in neutral Netherlands, and in the main three Central Powers. The shrinkage in GDP in Austria, Russia, France, and the Ottoman Empire reached 30 to 40 percent. In Austria, for example, most of the pigs were slaughtered and, at war’s end, there was no meat.</p>
<p>All nations had increases in the government’s share of GDP, surpassing fifty percent in both Germany and France and nearly reaching fifty percent in Britain. To pay for purchases in the United States, Britain cashed in its massive investments in American railroads and then began borrowing heavily on Wall Street. President Wilson was on the verge of cutting off the loans in late 1916, but with war imminent with Germany, he allowed a massive increase in U.S. government lending to the Allies. After 1919, the U.S. demanded repayment of these loans, which, in part, were funded by German reparations, which, in turn, were supported by American loans to Germany. This circular system collapsed in 1931 and the loans were never repaid.</p>
<p>One of the most dramatic effects was the expansion of governmental powers and responsibilities in Britain, France, the United States, and the <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominions.html" title="Dominions">Dominions</a> of the British Empire. In order to harness all the power of their societies, new government ministries and powers were created. New taxes were levied and laws enacted, all of which were designed to bolster the war effort; many of which have lasted to this day.</p>
<p>At the same time, the war strained the abilities of the formerly large and bureaucratized governments such as in Austria-Hungary and Germany. Here, however, the long term effects were clouded by the defeat of these governments.</p>
<p>Families were altered by the departure of many men. With the death or absence of the primary wage earner, women were forced into the workforce in unprecedented numbers. At the same time, industry needed to replace the lost laborers sent to war. This aided the struggle for <a href="../../../s/u/f/Suffragette.html" title="Suffragette">voting rights for women</a>.</p>
<p>As the war slowly turned into a war of attrition, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conscription.html" title="Conscription">conscription</a> was implemented in some countries. This issue was particularly explosive in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> and opened a political gap between the French-Canadians—who claimed their true loyalty was to Canada and not the British Empire—and the English-speaking majority who saw the war as a duty to both Britain and Canada, and a way of demonstrating leadership and high contribution to the British Empire. Prime Minister <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_Robert_Borden_62aa.html" title="Sir Robert Borden">Sir Robert Borden</a> pushed through a <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_Service_Act_4f97.html" title="Military Service Act">Military Service Act</a> that caused the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conscription_Crisis_of_1917_d7f2.html" title="Conscription Crisis of 1917">Conscription Crisis of 1917</a>.</p>
<p>In Britain, rationing was finally imposed in early 1918 and was limited to meat, sugar and fats (butter and <a href="../../../o/l/e/Oleo.html" title="Oleo">oleo</a>), but not bread. The new system worked smoothly. From 1914 to 1918 trade union membership doubled, from a little over four million to a little over eight million. Work stoppages and strikes became frequent in 1917-18 as the unions expressed grievances regarding prices, liquor control, pay disputes, “dilution”, fatigue from overtime and from Sunday work, and inadequate housing. Conscription put into uniform nearly every physically fit man, six million out of ten million eligible in Britain. Of these, about 750,000 lost their lives and 1,700,000 were wounded. Most deaths were to young unmarried men; however, 160,000 wives lost husbands and 300,000 children lost fathers. [Havighurst p 134–5]</p>

<p>The First World War began as a clash of 20th century <a href="../../../t/e/c/Technology.html" title="Technology">technology</a> with 19th century <a href="../../../t/a/c/Tactics.html" title="Tactics">tactics</a> and the inevitable appalling casualties. By the end of 1917, however, the major armies - now numbering millions of men - had modernized significantly and were making use of such technology as wireless communication, armoured cars, tanks, and tactical aircraft. The infantry was reorganized such that 100 man companies were no longer the main unit of maneuver in favour of the squad of 10 or so men under the command of a junior NCO. Artillery had also undergone a revolution; in 1914 cannons were sited in the front lines and firing over open sights directly at their targets; by 1917 indirect fire with guns (as well as mortars and even machine guns) was responsible for the majority of casualties inflicted, and counter-battery artillery missions became commonplace, using new techniques for spotting and ranging enemy artillery.</p>
<p>Much of the war’s combat involved <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trench_warfare.html" title="Trench warfare">trench warfare</a>, where hundreds often died for each yard of land gained. Many of the deadliest battles in history occurred during the First World War. Such battles include <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Ypres_e7cc.html" title="Battle of Ypres">Ypres</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/m/Vimy_Ridge_03b8.html" title="Vimy Ridge">Vimy Ridge</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Marne_03b9.html" title="Battle of the Marne">Marne</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Cambrai_e192.html" title="Battle of Cambrai">Cambrai</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Somme_%281916%29_72c7.html" title="Battle of the Somme (1916)">Somme</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Verdun_6eb8.html" title="Battle of Verdun">Verdun</a>, and <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Gallipoli_132c.html" title="Battle of Gallipoli">Gallipoli</a>. Artillery was responsible for the largest number of casualties during the First World War. The war consumed vast quantities of explosives. During the war, the <a href="../../../h/a/b/Haber_process.html" title="Haber process">Haber process</a> of nitrogen fixation was employed to provide the German forces with a continuing supply of powder for the ongoing conflict in the face of British naval control over the trade routes for naturally occurring nitrates.</p>
<p>There was <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemical_warfare.html" title="Chemical warfare">chemical warfare</a> and aerial bombardment, both of which had been outlawed under the 1907 <a href="../../../h/a/g/Hague_Conventions_%281899_and_1907%29_6818.html" title="Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)">Hague Convention</a>, and both of which had extremely limited effects in tactical terms.</p>
<p>Chemical warfare was <a href="../../../u/s/e/Use_of_poison_gas_in_World_War_I_7c33.html" title="Use of poison gas in World War I">a major distinguishing factor of the war</a>. Gases used ranged from <a href="../../../t/e/a/Tear_gas.html" title="Tear gas">tear gas</a> to disabling chemicals such as <a href="../../../m/u/s/Mustard_gas.html" title="Mustard gas">mustard gas</a> and killing <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biological_agent.html" title="Biological agent">agents</a> like <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phosgene.html" title="Phosgene">phosgene</a>. Only a small proportion of total war casualties were caused by gas, but it achieved harassment and psychological effects. Effective countermeasures to gas were found in <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gas_mask.html" title="Gas mask">gas masks</a> and hence in the later stages of the war, even as the use of gas increased, its effectiveness in creating casualties was quite limited.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most powerful weapons of the Great War were railway artillery. As the war progressed, military heavy-guns became increasingly larger. As each belligerent nation increased the <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firepower.html" title="Firepower">firepower</a> and range of its artillery, the other nations were required to respond likewise in order to prevent the technological superiority of any given military power. The naval guns of the day were the largest guns on the planet, and weighed hundreds of tons apiece. Thus, a method for transporting these guns was essential, and <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railroads.html" title="Railroads">railroads</a> became the favored means. The largest U.S., British, and French <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railway_gun.html" title="Railway gun">rail guns</a> were severely outranged by the German <a href="../../../k/r/u/Krupp.html" title="Krupp">Krupp</a>, Max E, and <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris_Gun_cd20.html" title="Paris Gun">Paris Guns</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../f/i/x/Fixed-wing_aircraft.html" title="Fixed-wing aircraft">Fixed-wing aircraft</a> were <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_Aviation_df23.html" title="World War I Aviation">first used militarily during the First World War</a>. Initial uses consisted primarily of <a href="../../../r/e/c/Reconnaissance.html" title="Reconnaissance">reconnaissance</a>, though this developed into <a href="../../../c/l/o/Close_air_support.html" title="Close air support">ground-attack</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/g/Fighter_aircraft.html" title="Fighter aircraft">fighter</a> duties as well. <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strategic_bombing.html" title="Strategic bombing">Strategic bombing</a> aircraft were created principally by the Germans and British, though the former used <a href="../../../z/e/p/Zeppelin.html" title="Zeppelin">Zeppelins</a> to this end as well.</p>
<p><a href="../../../u/-/b/U-boat.html" title="U-boat">U-boats</a> (<a href="../../../s/u/b/Submarines.html" title="Submarines">submarines</a>) were used in combat shortly after the war began. Alternating between restricted and <a href="../../../u/n/r/Unrestricted_submarine_warfare.html" title="Unrestricted submarine warfare">unrestricted submarine warfare</a> during the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Battle_of_the_Atlantic_77a6.html" title="First Battle of the Atlantic">First Battle of the Atlantic</a>, they were employed by the <a href="../../../k/a/i/Kaiserliche_Marine_51f8.html" title="Kaiserliche Marine">Kaiserliche Marine</a> in a strategy of defeating the British Empire through a tonnage war. The deaths of British merchantmen and the invulnerability of U-boats led to the development of several countermeasures: <a href="../../../d/e/p/Depth_charges.html" title="Depth charges">depth charges</a> (1916), <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrophones.html" title="Hydrophones">hydrophones</a> (passive <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonar.html" title="Sonar">sonar</a>, 1917), <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blimp.html" title="Blimp">blimps</a>, <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hunter-killer.html" title="Hunter-killer">hunter-killer</a> submarines (HMS <i>R-1</i>, 1917), ahead-throwing weapons, and dipping hydrophones (both abandoned in 1918). To extend their operations, the Germans proposed supply submarines (1916). Most of these would be forgotten in the interwar period until World War II revived the need.</p>
<p>Trenches, the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machine_gun.html" title="Machine gun">machine gun</a>, air reconnaissance, barbed wire, and modern artillery with <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shrapnel_shell.html" title="Shrapnel shell">fragmentation shells</a> helped stalemate the battle lines of World War I by making massed infantry attacks deadly for the attacker. The infantry was armed mostly with <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolt_action.html" title="Bolt action">bolt action</a> magazine rifles, but the machine gun, with the ability to fire hundreds of rounds per minute, blunted infantry attacks as an offensive doctrine. The British sought a solution and created the tank, and with it <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mechanized_warfare.html" title="Mechanized warfare">mechanized warfare</a>. The <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_I_%28tank%29_7b73.html" title="Mark I (tank)">first tanks</a> were used during the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Somme_c1c5.html" title="Battle of the Somme">Battle of the Somme</a> on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_15.html" title="September 15">September 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1916.html" title="1916">1916</a>; mechanical reliability issues hampered their mobility but the experiment proved its worth as protection against enemy weapons, particularly the machine gun. Within a year the British were fielding tanks by the hundreds and showed their potential during the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Cambrai_e192.html" title="Battle of Cambrai">Battle of Cambrai</a> in November 1917 by breaking the Hindenburg Line while combined arms teams captured 8000 enemy soldiers and 100 guns. Light automatic weapons were also introduced, such as the Lewis Gun and Browning Automatic Rifle, combining the firepower of the machine gun with the portability of the rifle.</p>
<p>Manned observation balloons floating high above the trenches were used as stationary reconnaissance points on the front lines, reporting enemy troop positions and directing artillery fire. Balloons commonly had a crew of two personell equiped with <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parachutes.html" title="Parachutes">parachutes</a>: upon an enemy air attack on the flammable balloon the balloon crew would parachute to safety. At the time, parachutes were too bulky to be used by pilots in airplanes, and smaller versions would not be developed untill the end of the war. Recognised for their value as observer platforms, Observation balloons were important targets of enemy aircraft. To defend against air attack, they were heavily protected by large concentrations antiaircraft guns and patrolled by friendly airplanes. Blimps and balloons helped contribute to the stalemate of the trench warfare of World War I, and the balloons contributed to air to air combat among the aircraft to defend the skies for air superiority because of their significant reconnaissance value. The Germans conducted air raids during 1915 and 1916 on England and London with airships with the intent to damage the morale and will to fight of the British and to cause aircraft to be reassigned to England away from the front lines.</p>
<p>Another new weapon sprayed jets of burning fuel: <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flamethrowers.html" title="Flamethrowers">flamethrowers</a>. First used in war by the German army, and later adopted by other powers during WWI (it was invented prior to this, and simple models have existed since ancient times). Although not of high tactical value, they were a powerfull demoralizing weapon and caused much terror on the battle field. It was a dangerous weapon to wield as their heavy weight made operators vulnrable targets, and the fuel on their backs was highly flammable.</p>

The direct consequences of World War I brought many old regimes crashing to the ground, and ultimately, would lead to the end of 300 years of European hegemony in the world.</p>

<p>The Versailles Treaty required Germany to pay enormous reparations, which it did by borrowing from the United States, until reparations were suspended in 1931. The “Guilt Thesis” became controversial in Britain and the United States. It caused enormous bitterness in Germany, which nationalist movements, especially the Nazis, exploited in the 1920s.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian.html" title="Australian">Australian</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> popular minds, the First World War became known as the nation’s “baptism of fire”, as it was the first major war in which the newly established countries fought, and it is one of the first cases where Australian troops fought as Australians, not just subjects of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Crown_e446.html" title="British Crown">British Crown</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/z/Anzac_Day_6fb3.html" title="Anzac Day">Anzac Day</a> (Australia New Zealand Army Corps) is thus held in great reverence by many Australians and New Zealanders.</p>
<p>Similarly, Anglo-Canadians believe that they proved they were their own country and not just subjects of the British Empire. Indeed, many Canadians refer to their country as a nation “forged from fire,” as <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canadians</a> were respected internationally as an independent nation from the conflagrations of war and bravery. Like their <a href="../../../b/r/i/British.html" title="British">British</a> counterparts, Canadians commemorate the war dead on <a href="../../../r/e/m/Remembrance_Day_973f.html" title="Remembrance Day">Remembrance Day</a>. However the French Canadians did not see it that way, creating a permanent chasm that continutes to split the country.

<p>The experiences of the war led to a sort of collective national trauma afterwards for all the participating countries. The optimism of the 1900s was entirely gone and those who fought in the war became what is known as “the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_Generation_f04d.html" title="Lost Generation">Lost Generation</a>” because they never fully recovered from their experiences. For the next few years, much of Europe began its mourning; memorials were erected in thousands of villages and towns.</p>
<p>This social trauma manifested itself in many different ways. Some people were revolted by <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalism.html" title="Nationalism">nationalism</a> and what it had supposedly caused and began to work toward a more <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internationalism_%28politics%29.html" title="Internationalism (politics)">internationalist</a> world, supporting organizations such as the <a href="../../../l/e/a/League_of_Nations_d214.html" title="League of Nations">League of Nations</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacifism.html" title="Pacifism">Pacifism</a> became increasingly popular. Others had the opposite reaction, feeling that only strength and <a href="../../../m/i/l/Militarism.html" title="Militarism">military might</a> could be relied upon for protection in a chaotic and inhumane world that did not respect hypothetical notions of civilization. “<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-modernism.html" title="Anti-modernism">Anti-modernist</a>” views were a reaction against the many changes taking place within society. The rise of <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazism</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">fascism</a> included a revival of the nationalistic spirit of the prewar years and, on principle, a rejection of many postwar changes. Similarly, the popularity of the <a href="../../../d/o/l/Dolchstosslegende.html" title="Dolchstosslegende">Dolchstosslegende</a> was a testement to the psychological state of the defeated, as acceptance of the scapegoating mythos signified a rejection of the “lessons” of the war and therefore, a rejection of its popular resulting perspective. Certainly a sense of <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disillusionment.html" title="Disillusionment">disillusionment</a> and <a href="../../../c/y/n/Cynicism.html" title="Cynicism">cynicism</a> became pronounced, with <a href="../../../n/i/h/Nihilism.html" title="Nihilism">Nihilism</a> growing in popularity. This disillusionment towards humanity found a cultural climax with the <a href="../../../d/a/d/Dada.html" title="Dada">Dadaist</a> artistic movement. Many people believed that the war heralded the end of the world as they had known it, including the collapse of <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalism.html" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a> and <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperialism.html" title="Imperialism">imperialism</a>. <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist.html" title="Communist">Communist</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist.html" title="Socialist">socialist</a> movements around the world drew strength from this theory and enjoyed a level of popularity they had never known before. These feelings were most pronounced in areas directly or particularly harshly affected by the war, especially within Europe.</p>

<p>World War I has also been called “The Great War” (a title previously used to refer to the <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleonic_Wars_898f.html" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>) or sometimes “the <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_to_end_all_wars.html" title="War to end all wars">war to end all wars</a>” until <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>.

<p><i>“Yesterday I visited the battlefield of last year. The place was scarcely recognisable. Instead of a wilderness of ground torn up by shell, the ground was a garden of wild flowers and tall grasses. Most remarkable of all was the appearance of many thousands of white butterflies which fluttered around. It was as if the souls of the dead soldiers had come to haunt the spot where so many fell. It was eerie to see them. And the silence! It was so still that I could almost hear the beat of the butterflies' wings”.</i> —a British officer, 1919.</p>
<p><i>“The First World War killed fewer victims than the Second World War, destroyed fewer buildings, and uprooted millions instead of tens of millions - but in many ways it left even deeper scars both on the mind and on the map of Europe. The old world never recovered from the shock”.</i> —Edmond Taylor, in <i>“The Fossil Monarchies”</i></p>
