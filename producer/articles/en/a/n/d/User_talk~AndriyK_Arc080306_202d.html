<p>Hi again! Please take a look at <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukraine_portal.html" title="Ukraine portal">Ukraine portal</a> here at Wikipedia. It may be useful to find out what's going on in UA-related topics. You may want to add two announcement boards there to your watchlist:</p>

<dd>Andriy, once again I offer you to engage into some kind of constructive discussion. I see what position you are coming from and I respect that. However, your language and pattern will lead nowhere. Instead of deleting, cut-and-pasting, cursing and throwing occasional phrases that disrupt article's flow, please do some constructive editing. Many articles do need improvement to be sure but we don't need to bring this spirit here. If it is too much to ask of you to engage into creative editing, please make a better use of talk pages. I hope, you will bring some positive contribution to Ukrainian topics. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 07:06, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I also <b>very well</b> understand what is behind your editings and would like to remind you that <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_propaganda_machine" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a propaganda machine</a>. Any wrong information should be removed from the articles and, be sure, it <b>will be</b> removed. This my <b>positive</b> contribution to the Wikipedia. It improves the quality of the resource, because <i>wrong information</i> is <b>much worse</b> than <i>lack</i> of information. If you are not agree and would like put the information back, please folow the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_official_policy_9680.html" title="Category:Wikipedia official policy">Wikipedia_official_policy</a> and cite a <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">cite credible sources</a>.

<p>Andriy, your work on Ukraine-related articles and other contributions are appreciated, but please keep in mind that other Wikipedians have already put in a <i>lot</i> of work to make them what they already are, and this is a collaborative project. Conflict and stress are hugely counterproductive, as we have learned from past experiences in this community. In the long run your contribution would be <i>even more positive</i> if you would <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">wp:assume good faith</a> and be a bit more <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">wp:civil</a>.

<dd>Dear Michael, thanks for your message. In fact, I just reminded Irpen that s/he (as everybody else) should respect Wikipedia policy. (You can check this. I signed my messages on my and Irpen's talk pages). Is this a reason for a conflict or stress?&#160;;) --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndriyK_f787.html" title="User:AndriyK">AndriyK</a> 17:14, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just that, huh? Or should I quote from the original messages you posted at ua-wikipedia talk pages about my work in exact words that you were using and calling others to join in? You may consider apologizing but you don't have to, as I said. I won't loose my sleep over this. If that anon phobic attack on my talk wasn't yours it was from one of the buddies in response to your call. That was indeed somewhat painful to see after the work I put writing about my country for Wikipedia unlike your foul language that speak about no one but yourself.</p>
<p>Michael and myself had MANY disagreements and we always worked them out. It is OK to disagree. If you stay polite and raise your objections civilly, fine, we'll work them out. If they remain unresolvable, we could ask for more eyes checking this. Anything can be worked out with patience and good faith.</p>
<p>Other than Michael and myself there is just a handful of editors who are trying to cover Ukraine grossly underrepresented in en-wiki. If you want to help, fine. Join in! If all you do is deletion, uncivil attacks, unwarranted Ukrainization of names (Chernihiv) and random dumping of information that advance your views into the articles (Bogolyubsky into Kiev) you will just make things more difficult. Or was that again some of those you recruited who did that? <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chernihiv.html" title="Chernihiv">Chernihiv</a> in its recent form was written by me from a totally pitiful shape and I took all care I could to use names (not just Russian but Polish too) correctly in the contexts. Then you, guys, come and do nothing but the name changes actually enforcing a modern Ukrainian name to the times it doesn't belong. I mean can't you improve the article, add to the history, etc? Similar with Bogolyubsky. He was introduced into two Kiev articles right into the very first paragraph. Why waste everyone's time? If you see the important info is missing and have no time or desire to do it properly, add it to talk! If you hesitate to write for the article because of your English, don't hesitate a bit! My own English needs improvement too and Michael and others copyedit my text all the time.</p>
<p>One more time, I suggest we stop this warring. Don't suspect anyone who you disagree in being anti-Ukrainian. We really have enough edit conflicts with some of our neighbors to add to this. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 03:19, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thank you, I accept your retraction of uncivil remarks and I hope anon who signed <i>Gutsul</i> will retract his. Anyway, let's move on. I hope we will manage to cooperate in imrpoving the UA-coverage. There certainly will be differences but they can be worked out.

<p>напиши рац . предложение - пусть web-дизайнер немного доработает логику сайта&#160;: перед редактированием или сохранением текста запрашивать перевод 10 контрольных слов на национальный (украинский) язык (например rope -&gt; мотузка)-&gt; если введут правильно -&gt; сохраняется -&gt; а кацапи ж не знають як по українськи правильно то вони хрен и сохранять текст</p>

<p>Most of your editing there was indeed just substitution of what was already there with a POV terms ("Nazi ally", "occupation", etc). These are valid POV's but still not universally agreed. You may want to check the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allies_of_World_War_II_afb4.html" title="Allies of World War II">Allies of World War II</a> article's talk for this discussion. Your removal of the link to OUN is unwarranted. There is only one factual disagreement. The article said that Soviet policies of Russification were preceeded by Ukrainization (that was indeed the case to suppress the Poles and replace them in the city, initially by Ukrainians. Russification came later. If you disagree, cite your sources. BTW, you are one step away from violating <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">3RR</a> if you haven't violated it already while I was writing this.

<dd>Oh, yes and to keep the context of the discussions you may respond at your own talk. I will keep an eye on it. Similarly, I mostly respond at my talk when I get the message there. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 07:07, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I had a really difficult day and I may not get to all the conserned articles immediately but I will get to them eventually. BTW, your calling on others to help you find a workaround against 3RR is childish. It will take only an anouncement at <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia_portal.html" title="Russia portal">Russia portal</a> to get some angry voices to your edits and I am, so far, avoiding that hoping we can work something out and agree on things.</p>
<p>In what I agree with you is that the <a href="../../../l/v/i/Lviv.html" title="Lviv">Lviv</a> article does need a lot of work being so Polonocentric (not that I am against it covering the Polish history of the city as well). If you manage to get attention of some quality editors to it, it would be really great. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 03:00, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please do not twist my words. I never said that <a href="../../../l/v/i/Lviv.html" title="Lviv">Lviv</a> article is "Polonocentric". The article need a lot of work because of it incompleteness, not because of "Polonicentricity" or any other "centricity". I am trying to find somebody who could improve it. In any case, wrong and inacurate information should be removed immediately. As I said, wrong information is much worse than lack of information.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndriyK_f787.html" title="User:AndriyK">AndriyK</a> 07:41, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You never said that indeed and I didn't imply so. It was me who said that. I will get to your comments on Lviv there. In the meanwhile, I explained every single change I did after you in <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukrainian_language.html" title="Ukrainian language">Ukrainian language</a>.</p>
<p>I asked Gutsul to register so that there would be no confusion who leaves what and where, It is up to him now. His Ukrainophobia attack was the worst thing I've ever seen written to me yet on WP. -<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 07:48, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear friend, Ukrainian nationalism is the last thing we want in this project already torn apart by the Polish, Romanian, Belarusian, and Lithuanian nationalists. If you think that your naive ukrainization of the names for ancient East Slavic tribes is a good idea, you are wrong. They settled in some areas of modern-day Russia, not in Ukraine only. The Severyans, for example, never called themselves "Siverians" and have not been known as such until you came here. In Old East Slavic (like all other Slavic languages) the word for north is pronounced as "sever" not "siver". If your aim here is to engage in endless and ultimately fruitless edit wars and reverts, you'll get plenty of it, until your childish attitude towards editing is changed. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo">Ghirlandajo</a> 11:36, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dear, Ghirlandajo, in fact thay did call themseves "siverians". The letter "jat'" (I do not have it at my keyboard, but it looks similar to "ъ") was prononced as "je" in the Nothern Rus and as "i" in the South. Siverians (in spite of their "nothern" name) lived in Southern Rus.</dd>
<dd>Have not it been known, before I came here? I'm glad I gave the people a chance to learn something.</dd>
<dd>I hope you'll fill some gaps in your education. But for the time being, please do not blame peopple for Ukrainian (Polish, Romanian, Belarusian, Lithuanian etc.) nationalism just because they're not so ignorant as you are.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndriyK_f787.html" title="User:AndriyK">AndriyK</a> 18:57, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Look, I had my own share of arguing with Ghirlandajo. He and I disagreed many times but before calling him ignorant check his contributions. Actually it is a good practice to do before going into name-calling which is better avoided altogether.</p>
<p>Andriy, I have to start using more harsh words about what you are doing. Your fight to spread Ukrainian nationalism into Wikipedia is doomed. Please reconsider wasting yours' and others' time. If not, you will just force others to spend time undoing your damage, time that would be better spent for bringing in more information to WP.</p>
<p>I do see that some edits you make bring useful info and I welcome that. However, much of what you've done so far requires the repair rather than adjustment. One more time, I am asking you to curb your aggressive spread of questionable edits. You view mine and others' ideas questionable. Fine with me. We all make mistakes. But your staunch disagreement to compromise to find the golden middle is unrpoductive.</p>
<p>And one more thing regarding the names substitution. The few most annoying things people can do are (excluding personal attacks):</p>
<ul>
<li>making an edit which all it does is name substituiton/addition</li>
<li>making an edit which just deletes stuff (well, this is sometimes good but very rarely)</li>
<li>insert disconnected phrase into an article to advance some POV</li>
</ul>
<p>On the former (names), check my proposal at <a href="../../../e/a/s/Wikipedia%7EEastern_European_Wikipedians%27_notice_board_12e0.html#Games_with_names" title="Wikipedia:Eastern European Wikipedians' notice board">Wikipedia:Eastern_European_Wikipedians'_notice_board#Games_with_names</a> and discussion at talk. Now, would you please give a little thought to what several people are trying to tell you? If you abide yourself by a proposed restriction and, at least, combine name substitution with other improvements that would be a good step.</p>
<p>I hope my comments do not offend you and you will reconsider certain things even if a little bit. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 19:34, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

Hi, Andriy! I'm not sure how many people other than Ukrainians will read about Ukraine on Wikipedia. Still, the content of the pages on Ukraine is important. I would like to help out as much as I can as well. Here's a question: how can we change "Kiev" to "Kyiv"? Volodya Nazarkevych</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi, Volodya! It would be difficult to change Kiev to Kyiv right now. We have to wait until Kyiv becomes more common in English. But most of other Ukrainian cities and towns should be spelled according to the Ukrainian pronociation. So just look trough the Ukraine-related articles and correct misspelligs. The article title can be changed by using the "move" button in the toolbar above the article. But this works only in the simpliest case. For more complicated cases, we have to wait until our community becomes a bit stronger. Otherwise the "Russian Mafia" will start the "edit war" and we defeet.</dd>
<dd>Even more important, to extend Ukraine-related articles and make them more balanced and correct, or write new articles about Ukraine (but please do not create very short "stub" articles).</dd>
<dd>Hope to here from you soon. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndriyK_f787.html" title="User:AndriyK">AndriyK</a> 12:50, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Good to see more editors interested in expanding Ukrainian-related articles.</p>
<p>Please try not to spend too much time on symbolic gestures, like changing the title of the article from Kiev to <a href="../../../k/y/i/Kyiv.html" title="Kyiv">Kyiv</a>. I've gone that route, and its just not acceptable as the primary name to the ears of most English-speakers. It took patience just to convince some productive editors that we should write "Ukraine" instead of "the Ukraine", but a reasonable argument backed up with references prevailed.</p>
<p>Concentrate on building the body of articles, and especially on adding material to achieve balance where editors have started articles with a limited scope. You'll find a list of articles needing attention at <a href="../../../u/k/r/Portal%7EUkraine_ad6e.html" title="Portal:Ukraine">Portal:Ukraine</a>.</p>
<p>And don't be afraid that you have to fight against a «група "русскіх патріотов"», or «вандалізму з боку "російської мафії"». Everybody here has their own point of view, but most of us are reasonable folks who are willing to listen to a convincing argument. There's the occasional difficult editor in every camp, but discussion and consensus will work things out.</p>

<dd>I agree with Michael concerning Kyiv/Kiev. We indeed have to wait until Kyiv becomes more common in English. But concerning most of other city/town/village/etc. names, this is not only "symbolic gestures". Misspelling of the names may often lead to mistakes. See, for istance, article about <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polans_%28eastern%29.html" title="Polans (eastern)">Polans</a>. B<b>i</b>l<b>h</b>orod was misspalled as B<b>e</b>l<b>g</b>orod and linked to Russian city of <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgorod.html" title="Belgorod">Belgorod</a>, which is several hundreds kilometers from Kyiv and has nothing to do with Polans.

<p>I suggest that the information on Ukraine will be edited following such very simple approach: The geography, the tourist information as is eyes-witness. Microsoft World Map acronim is very usable, but it is't indisputable. History articles of the territories making Ukraine preferable from the different points of view. It is desirable to make references on contemporary records. But fictions such as " Чорна рада " are factual now. It is desirable to add the clause "great Russian goal analysis". We must be patient and persevering and we will organize command work editors for daily repare after vandals (or volyntary employees of KGB-FSA - let them wrote about they own goals, not about Kiev/Kyiv/Kyyv as (C) Microsoft). May be it is usable to host a mirror of the articles about Ukraine in Wiki, which created by Ukrainian editors team. PS. We use to name Kirgizia, now oure russian brothers and we say: Kirgystan. And nothing can be done about.</p>
<p><br />
Andriju, just a thought - please ponder or ignore if you will. I fully agree with your aim to present Ukrainian related content in Wikipedia in neutral fact based manner free from Russian (and to lesser extent, Polish), bias. I am not sure though your methods would work in the current environment (e.g. the number of Russian and Russo-assimilated Ukrainian editors exceeding the number of Ukrainian editors). Russians proper + Russians with Ukrainian surnames are very sizeable minority back home, but a minority nonetheless. I see no reason why they should have control of Ukrainian content of Wikipedia and by doing so perpetuate age old Russian stereotyping. I believe Irpen recently called on Russian editors to particiapate to the fullest extent in editing Ukraine related content. It would help immensely if the balance is redressed through attracting a number of Ukrainian editors. The catch is they need to be capable of crafting quality articles in English hence advertising the job on Maidan.org or most other political forums does not cut it. I posted a message on ukrcenter in London and suspect Mohylanka's forum be good, too. In other words, popularisation of English Wikipedia needs to be done in a more focussed way and choice of forums need to be geared more towards English/Academic ability. In the end, this is for the benefit of the whole Wikipedia project. Cheers. Buchik 15:58, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please send me the addresses of the forums were the advertizing of Wikipedia would be effective. Let' think what else could we do to invite more Ukrainian editors to Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>One more problem. Ukrainian editoprs find themselves in a very hostile environment. Almost every Ukrainian editor's edit very likelly will be reverted by Irpen. To make a little correction to the article (which normally would take a quater of hour or so), one has to spend hours or even day explaining Irpen basics of Ukrainian history, linguistics, etc. And there are a group of Russian users (or even not only Russian) supporting this Irpen's behaviour. I suspect that many Ukrainians lived Wikipedia because of it. We should find the way to avoid such facts in future.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndriyK_f787.html" title="User:AndriyK">AndriyK</a> 14:11, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wikipedia is not a hostile environment if one approaches it respectfully and tries to understand the way things work.

<p>I saw your public call for attention to en-wiki (see? I read the same sites!) While I have certain objections to several statements you made there, I would be happy to see more editors for UA-topics.

<p>We may set up a separate board at <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukraine_portal.html" title="Ukraine portal">Ukraine portal</a> something like "Neutrality check board" where we will list and discuss articles with severe neutrality problems.

<dd>You know Andriy, it's a fact of history that sometimes conventional names in English come directly from the Russian language. In the history of Kievan Rus’, which is not "owned" solely by Belarusians, Russians, nor Ukrainians, sometimes we just have to settle for mentioning the modern Ukrainian name in an article, and living with a title that looks like modern Russian.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And if you'd just stifle your strident accusations of lying and propaganda, and the remarks about "Russian Mafia", if you respond to perceived slights like an adult instead of with a stream of invective and wails of "Irpen started it", maybe you will be taken a bit more seriously by established Wikipedians. You're the loudest of us advocates of Ukrainian point-of-view, and you're going to get us labelled as counter-productive whiners. I suggest you try to be extra-patient for a couple of weeks, and concentrate on some productive editing instead of a noisy crusade for Ukrainian terminology. Making changes around here requires a good <i>reputation</i> to achieve <i>consensus</i>, and you're quickly exhausting your good will and influence in this community. <i>—<a href="../../../m/z/a/User%7EMzajac_87ac.html" title="User:Mzajac">Michael</a>&#160;<a href="../../../m/z/a/User_talk%7EMzajac_a30f.html" title="User talk:Mzajac">Z.</a>&#160;<small>2005-10-20&#160;14:15&#160;Z</small></i></dd>

<p>You know, Andriy, I have no objection to several (not all) of your renamings, like Petrovka-&gt;Petrivka, Putivl-&gt;Putyvl and several others (not <i>derevlyans</i>, etc.) but it is indeed better for WP to do some more editing.

<p>Hi. I am, of course, in no position to tell you what to do and say.

<p>Massive article renaming is a waste of time. Overall, native speakers of English have absolutely <b>no interest</b> in Ukraine.

<p>I still hope you would reconsider your point of view and use your time more productively. For instance, you could double check name spelling in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_heroes_of_Ukraine_02c8.html" title="List of heroes of Ukraine">List of heroes of Ukraine</a> and complete the list for 1999 (I've already inserted links to edicts -- these are commented out). <a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESashazlv_9a06.html" title="User:Sashazlv">Sashazlv</a> 02:22, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>AndriyK, attracting editors from other online communities to contribute to Ukraine-related articles would be commendable, but you really lower the effort with your uncivilized "Russian gang" rhetoric. And your personal attack against Irpen at Maidan is beneath criticism. The "detailed analysis" you mention there is so much manure: you started a revert war with him in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=AndriyK&amp;offset=0&amp;limit=500" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=AndriyK&amp;offset=0&amp;limit=500" rel="nofollow">your very first edits</a> of Ukraine-related articles, and you're still holding a petty grudge. That you would go so far as to post an announcement on Maidan and at other forums to enlist help for your campaign is sad. From some of the thoughtful responses I read at there, I doubt you will find many gullible stooges who will listen to your hateful screed.</dd>

<dd>Irpen is a long-time member of Wikipedia and builder of its Ukrainian community; he is a knowledgeable and prolific contributor who's dedicated to maintaining a neutral point of view. He has repeatedly tried to engage you in constructive discussion and look for a compromise, and you have responded with name-calling and disrespect. You are a newcomer here, and in your brief tenure you've written nothing, only wasted other editors' time in revert wars and rude discussion. You are actively destructive, and you're going to give us Ukrainian editors a bad name.</dd>

<dd>We will... the portal will be multilinguistic and multitranslitratnistic. As to answer your question, quite a bit, first of all the majority of the stations in Kiev still contain both Russian and Ukranian language references, moreover say tourguides about a European city will give the metro name in English, whereas Russian guides on Kiev will quote the Russian name. Moreover if you remember the way it was done, first part - station names were given in Ukranian then ~ late 1960's Russian is used, but on the announcers instead of saying the name in Russian, it will give the Ukranian name with Russian grammar (quite unique if you ask me). For example Zhovnevaya, Chervonoarmeiskaya, Ploshchad Zhovtnevoi Revolutsii and ... so on. Finally when I was in Kiev last year I overheard on a ratio of 20:1 in the metro the public giving the station names in...Russian, so for an entry into say Prague metro, giving Russian transliteration will not be at all right, but Kiev and especially when we will make Kharkov and Dnepropetrovsk metros, both transliterations will be given. А если честно не занимайся дурью а давай вмести побольше фактов найдем про метро и вывесем, язык ты всегда потом успеешь поправить. Извени если ошибся но ты похоже в Киеве живешь? Даже если не живешь все равно приглашаю на форум <a href="http://www.forum.mymetro.ru" class="external text" title="http://www.forum.mymetro.ru" rel="nofollow">метролюбителей</a> у нас Киевлян (а точнее знатоков про Киевское Метро) мало, а это жалко.

<p>Hello, I am Knyaz, I have been watching wikipedia for long time (almost a year) but registered only now. I wanted to thank you for your actions against the nationalist edits of <a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo">User:Ghirlandajo</a>. Please don't give up; most of his edits (ones about historical, political things I mean; ones about Russian people are usually ok) are in fact not applicable to wikipedia and very POV; what is the saddest is that he defends them by reverts and therefore disrupts wikipedia, as well does not disucuss in talk page, calls everyone nationalist and such. So, in case he starts reverting your edits, try to inform other good editors of Wikipedia out of whom there are many in Eastern Europe (including many non-nationalist Russians). Something needs to be done about it, as I checked his edit history and it seems he is doing such POV edits frequently. If we will all cooperate however, we will defend Wikipedia from all the propaganda some users are pushing and will keep it a respectable encyclopedia... I am trying to inform the contributors whom I respect about this problem, you could try that too; and try to watch his contributions from time to time. Knyaz 09:51, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi! Thank you very much for your support! I felt myself a bit isolated in Wikipedia after several edit-war attacks.

<p>Having read the discussion threads recently, I found myself in a position of having nothing to add. I wholeheartedly agree with the arguments provided by others and am not willing to repeat the same things, which have already been told numerous times. On the other hand, I do not regard comments/sources provided by you as accurate, nor do I see your objections as (pardon the pun) objective.</p>
<p>With all that in mind, however, I do not approve of certain personal remarks against you (nor will I tolerate personal offenses by you, should you for some reason desire to employ such tactics in future).</p>
<p>Please, remember that the only way to "win" a revert war such as this one is to stop reverting and instead barrage "the enemy" (if you wish to see us in that light) with the facts and quotes from credible sources, preferrably in a neatly organized manner. Until this happens, I am going to stick to technical interpretation of Wikipedia policies (such as 3RR).—<a href="../../../e/z/h/User%7EEzhiki_e732.html" title="User:Ezhiki">Ëzhiki (erinaceus amurensis)</a> 14:18, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Britannica itself uses different spellings interchangeably, and the main article title is Chernigov. I am sure they had their reasons to do it that way, but Britannica naming policies are not the same as those employed by Wikipedia. Per WP's policies, <i>Chernihiv</i> spelling must be mentioned and explained, but <i>Chernigov</i> must be used while it is still more common in the English language. If I may remind you, you (as anyone else) have the right to appeal Wikipedia's policies or even start a campaign to change them. While it is definitely much more work that logging in every day to revert the changes you do not like, it is the only "legal" (from Wikipedia policies' point) way to find out what the true consensus is. Heck, you may even succeed if you are patient enough, although I personally would not bet on it.—<a href="../../../e/z/h/User%7EEzhiki_e732.html" title="User:Ezhiki">Ëzhiki (erinaceus amurensis)</a> 14:35, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>In fact, Britannica uses Cherni<b>hi</b>v for the title of the article.

<p>AndriyK. I would not get too concerned about Kuban kazaks and Irpen's messages above. You are doing an important, time consuming, tedious and ungrateful job of putting facts right and a number of people (myself included) support you for that. The opposing side's lack of argumentation and dubious statements (references to anti-ukrainian sites by Kuban kazak and misrepresentation of the majority of Maidan posters' comments by Irpen) all attest to their inability to play fair.

<p>These are all valid points but please show at the respective article's talk pages how this rant of yours relates specifically to them.</p>
<p>I could rant in response that WP is not a pamphlet to push fringe Ukrainian nationalist POV into related or unrelated articles, but instead I specifically pointed to you at the articles' talk pages when I found your edits disagreeable. Also, no one responded to your vote fraud (recruiting the absentee voters at outside forums who vote as you told them and left, very similar to Yanuk's tactics) by recruiting voters to inosmi.ru and I claim a partial credit for that because I asked people not to play these games no matter how low you go with yours.</p>
<p>Finally, if you are interested in presenting Ukrainian nationalist views to the world, here is another idea for you. Write a Ukrainian nationalism article and present this ideology there with analysis and references. But writing articles is much harder than correcting Chernigov for Chernihiv in an article I wrote or cutting pieces out of other my or other people's article.</p>
<p>For whatever reasons, there is little support in WP to your destructive behavior and your attempting to ascribe it to the anti-Ukrainian mafia that you imagined shows just how mainstream your views are. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 04:57, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As per your request, I informed a WP community that is interested in Ukraine, most of which consists of my Wikifriends at <a href="../../../u/k/r/Portal%7EUkraine_Ukraine-related_Wikipedia_notice_board_ec67.html#Announcement_of_behalf_of_user:AndriyK" title="Portal:Ukraine/Ukraine-related Wikipedia notice board">Portal:Ukraine/Ukraine-related_Wikipedia_notice_board#Announcement_of_behalf_of_user:AndriyK</a>. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 09:09, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So let me get this right, if someone adds a few language transliterations to the article about Lvov Oblast, that is considered "anti-Ukranian", if someone presents some inforamtion about a conflicting church and tells the truth about its cannonical status that is considered "anti-Ukranian". If someone adds information about the Kiev Metro, and uses Russian transliteration that is considered "anti-Ukranian". If someone presents a different POV on the abolishment of Zaparozhian Sech, and offers to intergrate this into the article, that is considered "anti-Ukranian". Mate, my wife is Volynian and my ancestors came from Zaporozhia so what makes YOU think that you are the one who has the power to decide what is anti-Ukranian propaganda or not? Also if you came here to write new articles, well write some articles then...give examples of some of the articles you wrote...or made significant contributions to. <a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">Kuban kazak</a> 18:41, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok Andrusha I have numerously seen you making statements that you came here to seriously edit and write new articles (yet so far your effort has been -- 0). Well why not prove yourself useful and for a change start earning a reputation of an editor instead of a dumbarse who pointlessly edits articles to suit his personal childish tastes. I made it easy for you, here is a challenge in an area where you are familiar with:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Drogobych and Izmail Oblasts; Moldavian ASSR</b></li>
<li>I have a few old atlases which show that in fact in the 1950's two more oblasts existed in UkSSR. From an <a href="http://info.poehali.net/c00000/1/" class="external text" title="http://info.poehali.net/c00000/1/" rel="nofollow">excellent collection</a> of topographical maps here is a <a href="http://info.poehali.net/c00080/1/" class="external text" title="http://info.poehali.net/c00080/1/" rel="nofollow">1940 atlas</a>, which on <a href="http://mapstor.com/content/agreement.php?cat=c&amp;num=00080&amp;file=c00080-A-23.jpg" class="external text" title="http://mapstor.com/content/agreement.php?cat=c&amp;num=00080&amp;file=c00080-A-23.jpg" rel="nofollow">Ukraine's</a> map (don't worry its the site that has the permission) clearly shows the Drogobych Oblast and the Moldavian ASSR, as well as the original 1939 border. I have a few late 1940's atlases which show the Izmail oblast as well (basically the part of Odessa oblast that was annexed from Bessarabia in 1940). So how should we present this quite important information?</li>
</ul>
<p>Well the question is for you to answer, give it a go, and all of us will see how you do it. In the meantime forget about everything else, take your time. Maybe once you've done that, you will make more articles and one day when you look back you will see how silly you really looked.</p>
<p>Понимаешь у меня о тебе сформировалoсь очень отрицательное мнение, но ведь не по-Русски оставлять своего в дерьме. Смотри на это как на протянутую руку. Решать тебе.</p>

<p>In any case, I just don't understand how the possibility that they will be renamed (which is not assured, BTW, since it would require consensus at move vote), so how this possibility is an obstacle for you to write them. You are relatively new here and you might not know that there is nothing unusual to have the articles being ended up at the name different from the name originally used by the author. Here is the list of some of my early articles that ended up renamed and I don't feel a least bit bad about it:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/d/m/Admiral_Makarov_adf3.html" title="Admiral Makarov">Admiral Makarov</a> I created was moved to <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stepan_Makarov_631b.html" title="Stepan Makarov">Stepan Makarov</a></li>

<li><a href="../../../k/o/n/Konstantin_of_Russia_f60f.html" title="Konstantin of Russia">Konstantin of Russia</a> was moved to <a href="../../../k/o/n/Konstantin_of_Rostov_303b.html" title="Konstantin of Rostov">Konstantin of Rostov</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../i/r/p/Irpen%27.html" title="Irpen'">Irpen'</a> was moved to <a href="../../../i/r/p/Irpin.html" title="Irpin">Irpin</a></li>

<li><a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Andrew%27s_Cathedral_6842.html" title="St. Andrew's Cathedral">St. Andrew's Cathedral</a> was moved several times and ended up at <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Andrew%27s_Church_of_Kiev_ffe7.html" title="St Andrew's Church of Kiev">St Andrew's Church of Kiev</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This is just some of the articles I created (many others were not moved), since with experience I started to pick names that satisfied other users. However, I don't hold any grudge to those who moved my articles and even to the move of <a href="../../../i/r/p/Irpen%27.html" title="Irpen'">Irpen'</a> to <a href="../../../i/r/p/Irpin.html" title="Irpin">Irpin</a> despite my being described by you an alleged leader of an alleged anti-Ukrainian mafia.

<dd>Mate I know exactly what you mean, but if AndriyK is going to represent the "true" Ukranian viewpoint, he will soon watch himself create a stereotype of Ukranians. All I'm trying to say that all of the Ukranians I know and a good portion of them come from the west of the country (my wife including) do not share his viewpoint, as do the majority of the population of that country. I am trying to point out to him that his actions will only make a third party point and laugh at him, Ukraine and Ukranians.

<p>The advise above for Russian wikipedians to look after their patch and not not to make judgement calls about Ukrainian subject matter was posted by me. Your reply above does not address my statement at all. I was not talking about AndriK's reverses in this instance (which I see as justified, BTW) but about Russian nationalism permeating your statements. Your previous post stated "<i>I know exactly what you mean, but if AndriyK is going to represent the "true" Ukranian viewpoint, he will soon watch himself create a stereotype of Ukranians. All I'm trying to say that all of the Ukranians I know and a good portion of them come from the west of the country (my wife including) do not share his viewpoint, as do the majority of the population of that country. I am trying to point out to him that his actions will only make a third party point and laugh at him, Ukraine and Ukranians</i>". This is no concern of yours and you are not qualified to make such statements. If you feel you must dispense judgement please stick to Russian topics. Leave ukrainians alone. BTW, I have already registered but am still trying to figure out the mechanics of login and signature/date stamping. Buchik</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ok if I have to repeate myself then fair enough so be it. 1) My ancestors came from Zaporozhia 2) My wife is Volynian 3) About a 5th of my life was spent living in Ukraine (in the west if I may ephasize, and I personally know that most of the stereotypes that you'll hear in Kiev, Donbass or Moscow about western Ukraine are wrong). 4) All I am doing is stating the obvious: AndriyK, in his time at Wikipedia manadged to achieve nothing apart from pointless and childish edit wars about obscrure spelling or wether a church was barged into... Moreover the user has created not a single article, and if he goes on trying to convince people that his view is true "Ukranian" then all he will achieve is to damage a respectble nations (and its peoples) reputation and create stereotypes. Whilst I might have patriotic POVs, I am against an article not repressinting the other side of the story. NPOV is a wikipedia policy which everyone must adhere to.</dd>

<p>Kuban Kazak. I do not want to be acrimonious or standoffish but should state again: reputation of Ukraine and Ukrainians is the matter for Ukrainians and Ukrainians only. Your ancestral and marital links do not qualify you as Ukrainian. You are Russian and quite clearly stated on your home page "I am also a Russian patriot and love my country like any Cossack must do". It is a known fact that Russian patriotism and Ukrainian patriotism are mutually exclusive. Our history is a testament to this. I have not noticed anybody on this page having an issue with you arguing with AndriyK's edits and reverts on the policy ground, but please, please keep your "big Russian brother" remarks to yourself. They come across as condescending and not helping your case one iota.</p>

<p>I know little about the specifics of Ukrainian religious history, so I will not involve myself in this ongoing debate. However, I urge you, AndriyK, to please show more restraint and do not accuse other contributors of lying, especially respected posters such as Irpen. Assume <a href="../../../g/o/o/Good_faith.html" title="Good faith">good faith</a>. It is possible that Irpen is wrong- I do not know enough about the relevant articles to know one way or the other. However, repeatedly and emotionally calling another contributor a liar does not seem like a good way to gain support for your case. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOlessi_e981.html" title="User:Olessi">Olessi</a> 19:27, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>You should chill out and listen to what Wikipedians with experience told you about things, in general, and about me, in particular. You should also have listened to what IlyaK and Gutsul told you at uk-wiki. You should also have listened to what Anatol (Yakudza), Nemesis (N8Sl8er) and others said at Maidan. You should have noted that Ukrainian (or interested in Ukraine) Wikipedians you contacted at their talk pages to try recruit them for your crusade crusade (Berkut, Halibutt, perhaps others too, I didn't follow) and those who you might have tried off Wikipedia did not join.</p>
<p>It could be that I am indeed not anti-Ukrainian. It could be that there is no anti-Ukrainian consipracy at wiki. It could be that Ghirlandajo (whom you called "відвертий і агресивний російський шовініст. Спеціалізується на перекручуванні українських географічних та інших назв на російський манер"), with whom I disageed many times and discussed differences at many talk pages, is a valuable contributor perceptive to communication who contributed a wealth of info about the Ukrainian people, history and culture. It could be that myself, MichaelZ, Sashazlv and all these others were the few who actually tried to present the mainstream Ukrainian POV here and it is your and your namesake's POV's are harming Ukraine at Wikipedia</p>

<p>WHy did you revert the article? I offered reasons. Unlike your namesake, who is just bullying, you often tried to discuss things in the past. Stop bullying and discuss at talk. I explained that too much emphasis oh history doesn't belong to the lead. There are no other language articles with similar whining in the lead paragraph. If you can find some, show them. If you disagree, express yourself. This will not be decided by two vs one rv war. I could have also asked for help and you both would be outnumbered.

<p>I am not saying it is unremarkable. I am saying that history doesn't belong to the lead. It makes it look a silly whining, almost lauphable. If Andrew Alexander in his Russophobia likes to make this and similar stuff as conspicuous as possible, it still doesn't make it the best for the UA L article to have a ridiculous lead. Check other languages, even the formerly banned ones. I already said at the artilce's talk, that I would like to see a linguistics specialist to add to the phonetics and grammar sections, the latter was just so pitiful that I moved it to talk. Politics is in history of L section where it belongs. Too bad that the rest isn't written yet. Next time, don't revert for the sake of solidarity, explain and, perhaps, when you try it, you will get a clearer picture that would be easier to defend in discussions. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 18:52, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Even if to consider the mentioning of the ban of Ukr. language if the first paragraph as a drawback of the article, this is deffinitely not the most major drawback.

<dd>To be fair I tend to agree with Irpen, I mean take our balachka dialect, it has no written form, yet ban or no ban it perfectly survived for 200+ years, even though we consider ourselves Russian, the dialect is quite close to modern Ukranian language. Anyway it is an important point, but not in the lead of an article. <a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">Kuban kazak</a> 19:45, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Andriy, please understand that the way to improve the balance is not to remove the stuff which is relevant but adding the information to balance it. If you think the article is unbalanced in giving too much attention to history and too little to linguistics, add the info about linguistics rather than remove info about history. Politics is very relevant to the history of the Ukrainian language. I made several calls at the article's talk for someone to write about linguistics and no one answered them including yourself. I could see removing the info which is irrelevant, but not the info which is relevant being removed for the sake of some "balance". You claim that lack of canonicity is irrelevant to a St. V's article. I disagree but I understand why you removed it from there. Certain aspects of Politics are relevant to UA L history and your removing isn't justified. In no other language article history is described in the lead, however. If you agree that this is a drawback, why, except for the hypothetical "solidarity" you restored it. Again, if the article lacks something, add it. But this is no reason to have a ridiculous lead. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 21:58, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>When removing "unrelevant historical and political suff" care to propose the removal first and wait for a reaction a little bit. The fact that language survived bans is relevant and it is there. It doesn't belong to the lead as no language article's lead contains history. Once we spin-off the <i>History of Ukrainian</i> into a separate article, we will have this in the lead there.

<p>And to the issue of carelessly forcing your opinion on everyone without discussion, did you see the discussion at <a href="../../../p/e/t/Talk%7EPeter_Mogila_61c5.html" title="Talk:Peter Mogila">talk:Peter Mogila</a>? If you did, why you moved an article nevertheless? I could have prevented that easily by creating a redirect in advance, but I didn't do it <i>knowingly</i> since I am used to assuming that editors behave civilly, listen to others and use the "move" function with care. If you would have raised the issue, other editors would have voiced their opinions and we might have decided to move the article.</p>
<p>Do not assume that any move is up to any editor only because it can be easily done. Let me illustrate this. Personally, I think that, since a WP is not a dictionary, <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polkovnyk.html" title="Polkovnyk">Polkovnyk</a> should be moved to a <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukrainian_Colonel_c6ae.html" title="Ukrainian Colonel">Ukrainian Colonel</a> name. Note that the link is red and I could have moved the article if I wanted to have it there and didn't care about what others think. Note that I didn't do that and no one else did. Several possibilities (including mergers of UA/PL/RU colonels into one article or merging them all into a <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonel.html" title="Colonel">colonel</a>) are being discussed and no one imposes his view by moving an article and making things difficult. You may of course follow your line of behavior and run into creating a redirect from <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukrainian_colonel.html" title="Ukrainian colonel">Ukrainian colonel</a> to <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polkovnyk.html" title="Polkovnyk">Polkovnyk</a> thus forcing your view on the others. However, I suggest you don't do this and be careful with moving articles. Propose the move, wait for responses. Others don't run into redirect creation as soon as the proposal they dislike appears.</p>
<p>Did you get any mediator's attention to St V's Cathedral (note, btw, who created the article and it was also not moved by your imagined conspirators to St Validmir Cathedral of Kiev, also note who created <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Mogila_9093.html" title="Peter Mogila">Peter Mogila</a> and NAUKMA articles) --07:08, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I would like that the article "Polkovnyk" was messed up by your incompetent edits and was replaced with "redirect" without any discussion by one of your friends. And all this happend before I even have finished the article. Pease choose a more constructive line of behavior and convince your friends to do so. Then you will not have any problem with me.</dd>
<dd>Concerning Mohyla's name, this should be regulated by an appropriate convention. The rules should be the same in all cases (or in almost all, at least). Be yourself consistent, either you count google hits or you look into Britannica, or something else, but there should be the same procedure in all cases.</dd>
<dd>It would be nice to extend the convention that now is being discussed to include there also names of people, organization and other entities. A cleare and unambigous definition of "most common English spelling" would be also very helpfull.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndriyK_f787.html" title="User:AndriyK">AndriyK</a> 08:18, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just said that you should have proposed the move. As for the competency of my edits, your highly educated opinion is very valuable to me. I am sorry you found my edit destructive. I will revert to you earlier version then with all the mess that I organized into a Wikipedia style and added the information to. If you choose to return my version or to use it, I would like an apology for your rudeness, but I will be just fine without it as well.</p>
<p>Coming back to Mohyla, I don't mind the new name at all. My point is that it is better to propose the move and wait a little bit for opinions. One might have brought up conventions that it is an English Wikipedia and moved Polkovnyk to <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukrainian_Colonel_c6ae.html" title="Ukrainian Colonel">Ukrainian Colonel</a>.

I don't really mind the new "Ukrainain" spellings (the whole notion of "polkovnik" vs "polkovnyk" seems rather humorous to me and reminds me an anecdote in Bulgakov's White Guard about kot and kit.), even though the real Ukrainian spelling was already mentioned in Cyrillic.

<p>Convetnions are guidleines and are subject to interpretations. That's why editors expect a proposal first as a courtesy, to think over and discuss the it, because undoing a move is often difficult. It is especially difficult if the user learned from Yanukovych how to rig the vote using absentee voters en masse.</p>
<p>BTW, did you create a <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukrainian_colonel.html" title="Ukrainian colonel">Ukrainian colonel</a> redirect because you judged others by the same standard? I am afraid you are mistaken. People here suggest the moves before making them. But you do learn fast, I must say.

<p>I find this especially funny to hear from you. You renamed Mogila disregarding how he is called in Britannica (including even the EB article's name!), and at the same time you revert Chernihiv with a "See Britannica" comment. Good go! However, even the assertion you are making (to justify the latter revert) is false. As I have shown at talk, Britannica usually uses Chernigov in the historical context (you are welcome to reread <a href="../../../c/h/e/Talk%7EChernihiv_b508.html" title="Talk:Chernihiv">talk:Chernihiv</a>).

I would like to express my thanks to all the people who took part in my (failed) <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Halibutt_3f65.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Halibutt">RfA voting</a>. I was both surprised and delighted about the amount of support votes and all the kind words! I was also surprised by the amount of people who stated clearly that they do care, be it by voting in for or against my candidacy. That's what Wiki community is about and I'm really pleased to see that it works.<br />
As my RfA voting failed with 71% support, I don't plan to reapply for adminship any more. However, I hope I might still be of some help to the community.

<p>Hello again. I received your second email. You may wish to read through the <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResolving_disputes_9a93.html" title="Wikipedia:Resolving disputes">Resolving disputes</a> page. It tells you about the avenues you have for arguing your case. However, my simple suggestion is to relax. Maybe ignore items that you believe are POV. Maybe create a new article on other topics that you are familiar with. Having spent a little time looking at your edit history, I see a lot of <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEdit_war_dd06.html" title="Wikipedia:Edit war">edit wars</a>. These are not looked upon positively by most Wikipedians. We are all volunteers here, we all make mistakes. The big mistakes tend to be corrected very quickly. Smaller mistakes do also get corrected, but maybe not as quickly. Maybe let someone else correct them for a little while. If you and Andrew Alexander spend time adding non-contentious content, people will likely stop suggesting you are both the same person. -- <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesTeterenko_c1e2.html" title="User:JamesTeterenko">JamesTeterenko</a> 06:45, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I saw the new link you added, but this link does not relate the dismissing/reapointing of Ivchenko with any his statements.

<p>FYI: User:Dovbush has been recently permanently blocked by some admin that I never saw or contacted as per the suspicion that Dovbush is the sockpuppet of yourself. Since that particular admin is not in the list of people with access to <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/CheckUser_Policy" class="extiw" title="m:CheckUser_Policy">checkuser tool</a> there is no guarantee that he established that for a fact. I did call for the check in your arbitration but I haven't seen any action on my calls.</p>
<p>As per this, if user:Dovbush is <b>not</b> your sockpuppet, you may consider to take some action to keep that user's ability to edit.

</dl>
<p>Ukrained is not involved in this. It is only User:Pecher, who refuses to respond to find a consensus with me and just wishes to revert to his old version without given reason. I have dicussed it on the talk page there and have only been flamed. You can see here why I am reverting to the other version: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Ukrainians&amp;diff=34229379&amp;oldid=34207105" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Ukrainians&amp;diff=34229379&amp;oldid=34207105" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>].

<dl>
<dd>I am sorry, I do not see any reasons why "Famous Foreign Nationals born on Ukrainian soil" should be in a separate section. The division is made by profession or similar. "Foreign Nationals" is not a profession. It destroys the logic of the list.</dd>

<p>How about we put these names in &lt;--- ---&gt; under their professions section. In order to do that however, we must use my version because it does not have all the deletions of the older version.

<dl>
<dd>If they were born, worked or lived on the territory of present-day Ukraine, I have no objections. There is no reason to change the leading paragraph, however.</dd>
<dd>I think, it would be more resonable to start with the current version and insert the names it lacks from your version.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndriyK_f787.html" title="User:AndriyK">AndriyK</a> 23:31, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Simply including these people in the list is controversial for other nationals as well because they are in no way Ukrainian. To include them we would have to include EVERYONE born on modern Ukrainian territory including Greeks from Ancient Times. There was a Greek colony in modern Ukraine. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntidote_a07c.html" title="User:Antidote">Antidote</a> 23:24, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If there were famous Greeks born on modern Ukrainian territory in Ancient Times, they clearly belong to the list according to the definition in the leading paragraph.

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The main problem right now is that Pecher's version has way too many deleted additions, and hence I need someone to finally see that my version needs to be reverted back -- then we can move the names into their selected sections and discuss this. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntidote_a07c.html" title="User:Antidote">Antidote</a> 23:34, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>All that needs to be done is a quick revert to the version I had before you reverted it and the names from "Foreign Nationals" moved to their respective locations. Then we can all have a civil debate about including those names at all or not. But as it is locked right now the list has just been practically maimed. If you agree with this, then say so on the talk page and it will help bring the edit war to a standstill. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntidote_a07c.html" title="User:Antidote">Antidote</a> 23:49, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>We need a third opinion to support the reversal to the newest version GIVEN that the names are readded.

<p>I have blocked Kk for a token 1 hour as per your request. But both of you are edit warring; please talk more and revert less.

<dd>Ну получил свое удовольствие за то что меня на час заткнули? А теперь назад к делу. What is clearely evident in your edits is that you have not bothered to read the history of the article and the events on the 14th and 21st of December. Here is how it went:</dd>

<dd>===Previous Edit:===
<dl>
<dd>After <a href="../../../p/a/r/Partitions_of_Poland_7a0c.html" title="Partitions of Poland">partitions of Poland</a> (<a href="../../../1/7/7/1772.html" title="1772">1772</a>–<a href="../../../1/7/9/1796.html" title="1796">1796</a>), the Belarusian territory was incorporated into <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Russia_1215.html" title="Imperial Russia">Imperial Russia</a>. Unlike Ukraine, Belarus has historically lacked a strong nationalistic drive. During the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth_68ac.html" title="Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth">Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth</a> times, educated people of Belarus tended to identify themselves with <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a>, and today some prominent persons are claimed both by Poland and Belarus for their nationality. More recently, the population of Belarus tends to identify itself as a close associate of <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a> (if not considering themselves Russian outright).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>One of the reasons for this situation is the minority status of Belarusian speakers in urban areas—traditional cultural centers. For example, according to the <a href="../../../1/8/9/1897.html" title="1897">1897</a> <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Russia_1215.html" title="Imperial Russia">Imperial Russian</a> census, in Belarusian towns of more than 50,000 residents, only 7.3% respondents reported Belarusian as their <a href="../../../m/o/t/Mother_tongue.html" title="Mother tongue">mother tongue</a> (the criterion in defining nationality for the purposes of the census). This state of affairs greatly contributed to a perception that Belarusian is a "rural", "uneducated" language.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century, very few people wrote in Belarusian, peasants being mostly illiterate, and urban dwellers preferring Russian, Polish or Yiddish. Still there existed a minor movement for returning to the Belarusian language; it was important in the circle of friends of <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Mickiewicz_3265.html" title="Adam Mickiewicz">Adam Mickiewicz</a>.</dd>

</dl>
</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>

<dd>And then:</dd>
<dd>The Belarusization was stalled and even reversed beginning in the <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a>. Hundreds of people were shot or sent to Siberia. The orthographic reform of <a href="../../../1/9/3/1933.html" title="1933">1933</a> clearly "russified" the Belarusian spelling rules. In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a></dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Initially Imperial Russian athorities thought that the language spoken by Belarusian peasents was nothing but Polonised Russian, nevertheless as Polish influence over the territory slackened, the Russification of Belarusian peasents proved counter productive. In the 1897 most refered to their home language as not Russian during Polish rule, but as Belarusian</dd>

<p>So, you called <i>me</i> a xenophobe then? Note, that Duca has been known in the past for his rude extreme Romanian nationalist comments that he makes against Ukrainians, Russians and Moldovans alike. It is important to let others be able to make a quick judgement about this editor and his edits. Therefore, I request that you let his message stay. It speaks only about himself. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 18:49, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Very well then. I will restore the comment because I find it important that others see Duca in real light.

<p>AndriyK, your undiscussed reversions to the Holodomor article are not helpful. See the extensive talk page discussions taking place over the course of the past week. There are strong neutality concerns with the version of the intro that you've restored. These concerns have nothing to do with the fights over nationalism that you have been having with Russian editors; the concerns pertain to the Western academic historiography on the subject. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 10:48, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Discussion is helpfull, if all participants demonstrate a willingness to find a compromise. To my experience most of the people opposing Andrew Alexander in this discussin do not accept any reason. I do not have any experience with you. Hopefully you are different from the rest. I answered you at the article talk.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndriyK_f787.html" title="User:AndriyK">AndriyK</a> 11:14, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Andrew Alexander and I have been discussing the article on the talk page for over a week. There's a much better chance of reaching a compromise on the article if the two of us work out a solution, without the article turning into a proxy revert war between Andrew Alexander and his allies on the one hand and Andrew Alexander's usual opponents on the other hand. I am a U.S. historian of Polish Jewish background, not a Communist or a Russian nationalist. I don't think that you have any reason to view me as sort of a threat. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 11:41, 23 January 2006 (UTC)
