<p><i><b>And Now For Something Completely Different</b></i> is a film <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spinoff.html" title="Spinoff">spinoff</a> from the television comedy series <i><a href="../../../m/o/n/Monty_Python%27s_Flying_Circus_5f2b.html" title="Monty Python's Flying Circus">Monty Python's Flying Circus</a></i> featuring favourite sketches from the first two seasons. The title was originally used as a <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catch_phrase.html" title="Catch phrase">catchphrase</a> in the TV show.</p>
<p>The film, released in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971_in_film.html" title="1971 in film">1971</a>, consists of 90 minutes of the best sketches seen in the first two series of the TV show. The sketches were remade on film without an audience, and was intended for an <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> audience which had not yet seen the series. The announcer uses the phrase "and now for something completely different" several times during the film, in situations such as being roasted on a spit and lying on top of the desk in a small, pink <a href="../../../b/i/k/Bikini.html" title="Bikini">bikini</a> (much to an onlooking pervert's disgust).</p>
<p>This movie is somewhat similar to the 1974 film <i>"<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Best_of_Benny_Hill_40a0.html" title="The Best of Benny Hill">The Best of Benny Hill</a>"</i> which was a film spinoff from the television comedy series <i>"<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Benny_Hill_Show_3bac.html" title="The Benny Hill Show">The Benny Hill Show</a>"</i> featuring favourite sketches from the first five years. The difference in both films are that the Pythons recreated all the sketches while Benny used clips from the Thames years and edited them together to make the film.</p>
<p>The film has been rated PG in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">UK</a>, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">U.S.</a> and in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/And_Now_For_Something_Completely_Different_eaf5.html" title="Edit section: Production with Lownes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Production with Lownes</span></h2>
<p>The film was the idea of entrepreneur <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victor_Lownes_6f74.html" title="Victor Lownes">Victor Lownes</a>, head of <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playboy_Enterprises_6d79.html" title="Playboy Enterprises">Playboy UK</a>, who convinced the group that a feature film would be the ideal way to introduce them to the US market and make them lots of money. Lownes acted as executive producer. Production of the film did not go entirely smoothly. Lownes tried to exert a lot more control over the group than they had been used to at the BBC. In particular, he objected so strongly to one character - 'Ken Shabby' - that the sketch was removed.</p>
<p>Another argument with Lownes occurred when Terry Gilliam designed the opening credits for the film. Presenting the names of the Pythons in blocks of stone, Lownes tried to insist that his name be displayed in a similar manner. Initially, Gilliam refused but eventually he was forced to give in. Gilliam then created a different style of credit for the Pythons so that in the final version of the film, Lownes' credit is the only one that appears in that way.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/And_Now_For_Something_Completely_Different_eaf5.html" title="Edit section: Budget">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Budget</span></h2>
<p>The budget of the film was horribly low for the time at only <a href="../../../p/o/u/Pound_sterling.html" title="Pound sterling">£</a>80,000. This is self-reflexively acknowledged in the film's Killer Cars animation; when the cat first appears and eats the building, an old man (voiced by Eric Idle) mentions "a scene of such spectacular proportions that it could never in your life be seen in a low budget film like this. You'll notice my mouth isn't moving, either". The film was shot both on location in England and inside an abandoned dairy, rather than on a more costly soundstage.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/And_Now_For_Something_Completely_Different_eaf5.html" title="Edit section: Origins of phrase">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Origins of phrase</span></h2>
<p>The phrase is derived from the kind of phrase used to link items in a TV "magazine show" such as the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a>'s <i>Tonight</i>, which alternated <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_affairs_%28news_format%29.html" title="Current affairs (news format)">current affairs</a> and interviews with lighter <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_interest.html" title="Human interest">human interest</a> material. It was often used on the BBC system, especially during its years of near-monopoly over British broadcast media, as a transition or bridge (or segue) between programs or program segments.</p>
<p>Many of the early episodes of the show feature a sensible-looking announcer (played by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Cleese_d081.html" title="John Cleese">John Cleese</a>) dressed in a sensible black suit and sitting behind a sensible wooden desk, which in turn is in some <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non_sequitur_%28absurdism%29.html" title="Non sequitur (absurdism)">ridiculous</a> location such as behind the bars of a zoo cage or in mid-air being held aloft by small attached propellers. The announcer would turn to the audience and announce "and now for something completely different", launching the show's opening credits starting with second series of the show.</p>
<p>The phrase was also used as a transition within the show. Often it would be added to in order to better explain the transition, for instance, "And now for something completely different: a man with a tape recorder up his nose." In later episodes, particularly the third season, the credits-launching was reduced to a split-second stock footage of the announcer saying "And now..." in a similar fashion as was done with its predecessor, the <a href="../../../22/i/t/_It%27s__man_293c.html" title="&quot;It's&quot; man">"It's" man</a>, which appears immediately after. Both were preceded by a <a href="../../../n/u/d/Nudity.html" title="Nudity">naked</a> <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organist.html" title="Organist">organist</a>.</p>

<li><b><a href="../../../h/o/w/How_Not_To_Be_Seen_2f79.html" title="How Not To Be Seen">How Not To Be Seen</a></b>: A government film which first displays the importance of not being seen, then devolves into various things being blown up, much to <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Cleese_d081.html" title="John Cleese">John Cleese</a>'s amusement.</li>
<li><b>A Man With a Tape Recorder Up His Nose:</b> After the main title sequence animated by <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terry_Gilliam_6d72.html" title="Terry Gilliam">Terry Gilliam</a>, which comes after the above sketch, a "The End" screen appears, but a stage emcee (<a href="../../../t/e/r/Terry_Jones_2ef1.html" title="Terry Jones">Terry Jones</a>) apologises for the cinema overestimation of the film's length and announces an interval. In the meantime, two short films are shown: One starring a man with a tape recorder up his nose and another starring a man with a tape recorder up his <i>brother's</i> nose (with a brief "stereo" segment at the end of the second film). (In a decided bit of irreverence, the tape recorder is playing <i><a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Marseillaise_a523.html" title="La Marseillaise">La Marseillaise</a></i>, the French national anthem).</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../d/i/r/Dirty_Hungarian_phrasebook_a73d.html" title="Dirty Hungarian phrasebook">Dirty Hungarian phrasebook</a>:</b> After the above mentioned interval ends, a sketch plays in which a Hungarian immigrant (<a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Cleese_d081.html" title="John Cleese">John Cleese</a>) is arrested after a series of linguistic cock-ups in a tobacconist's, beginning with "I will not buy this record, it is scratched" (believed by the Hungarian to be a request for cigarettes), then turning into various sexual innuendos ("Do you want to come back to my place, bouncy-bouncy?"). The incident reaches a peak as the tobacconist attempts to communicate "6 shillings, please" in Hungarian, and is rewarded with a left hook (presumably the phrasebook also attempts to create havoc for English people trying to speak Hungarian). The Hungarian gentleman is swiftly arrested for assault, but is released and the author (<a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Palin_778d.html" title="Michael Palin">Michael Palin</a>) of the fraudelent phrasebook is arrested instead.</li>

<li><b><a href="../../../n/u/d/Nudge_Nudge_9e46.html" title="Nudge Nudge">Wink wink, nudge nudge</a>:</b> The above animation ends and leads into a bar, where a man (Idle) asks another man (Jones) about his wife, with a relentless stream of sexual innuendos. It turns out that he simply wants to know, "What's <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_intercourse.html" title="Sexual intercourse">it</a> like?"</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../s/e/l/Self_Defense_Against_Fresh_Fruit_b49c.html" title="Self Defense Against Fresh Fruit">Self-Defense Class</a>:</b> A teacher (Cleese) educates his students (<a href="../../../g/r/a/Graham_Chapman_0ed7.html" title="Graham Chapman">Graham Chapman</a>, Terry Jones, Michael Palin, and Eric Idle) how to defend themselves from anyone armed with fresh fruit.</li>

He then tells the director to cut to a new scene, which is discovered to be about antisocial old ladies. Other gangs referenced are the Baby Snatchers (men dressed as babies snatching people off the street at random) and vicious "Keep Left" signs, at which point the colonel stops the sketch.</li>
<li><b>Military March:</b> A military squad does an extremely <a href="../../../e/f/f/Effeminate.html" title="Effeminate">effeminate</a> chant, which the colonel agains finds silly ("and a bit suspect, I think"), and replaces with a cartoon.</li>

<li><b>Bank Robber:</b> A bank robber (Cleese) mistakes a lingerie shop for a bank, and attempts to rob it. He is somewhat put out by his error, and makes do with a pair of panties.</li>
<li><b>People Falling Out of High Buildings:</b> A worker (Idle) sees people going past the window downwards, but his co-worker (Cleese) is uninterested, until they make a little wager that Parkinson will be next. A man played by Chapman then writes a letter of complaint, but just as he writes "I have worked in tall buildings all my life, and have never once--", he is somehow propelled out of a tall building</li>
<li><b>Animation-The Bug:</b> A bug with <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human.html" title="Human">humanlike</a> features goes to sleep and wakes up as a (effeminate male) butterfly.</li>

<li><b><a href="../../../v/o/c/Vocational_Guidance_Counsellor_de4d.html" title="Vocational Guidance Counsellor">Vocational Guidance Counsellor</a>:</b> Herbert Anchovy (Palin) no longer wants to be a chartered accountant, and harbours dreams of being a lion tamer. The counsellor (Cleese) suggests that Anchovy should instead work his way up to lion taming, via banking, an idea which Herbet initially rejects, until he is informed that the animal he thinks is a lion is in fact an <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anteater.html" title="Anteater">anteater</a>, and that mere stock footage of a lion scares the life out of him. He then desperately cries out that he just wants to see his name in lights, a wish granted by a magic fairy (played by Idle with a moustache).</li>

<li><b>The Battle of Pearl Harbor:</b> The silly-hating colonel appears again, and introduces a group of woman (the Pythons in drag) re-enacting the Battle of Pearl Harbour (or rather, beating each other with their handbags in mud)</li>
<li><b>Romantic Interlude:</b> A man (Jones) and girlfriend (Cleveland) begin making love, and several suggestive images are shown (an industrial chimney collapsing in reverse, a torpedo being fired, etc.), but the images are in fact only films being played by the man. The woman asks whether he's actually going to do something or just show films all night, and the man replies with "Just one more, dear"</li>

<li><b>Animation-End Titles:</b> The end credits, rendered in Terry Gilliam's typically absurd style.</li>

<p>The film did not offer anything extra for British fans, except the opportunity to see the sketches in colour at a time when many viewers still had black and white sets, and indeed many were disappointed that the film seemed to belie its title.</p>
