<p>Hi</p>
<p>Thought this may interest you: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AMichael_Jackson&amp;diff=37645322&amp;oldid=37615261" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AMichael_Jackson&amp;diff=37645322&amp;oldid=37615261" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AMichael_Jackson&amp;diff=37645322&amp;oldid=37615261</a></p>
<p>This guy seems to be getting a bit "out of hand". Is there anything that can be done? <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunky_Monkey_4ee6.html" title="User:Funky Monkey">Funky Monkey</a> 07:55, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, that's really not a personal attack (and I don't believe anything <i>I</i> said was, either... I just offered my honest opinion) so no big deal. If it gets really out of hand, there are ways we can deal with this; an article RfC might be useful either way. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 12:10, 1 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I simply do not like being insulted when all I am doing is trying my best to improve <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Jackson_1873.html" title="Michael Jackson">Michael Jackson</a>. In fact, my work on improving the article has been commended so I don't see where you are coming from calling me a "problem". <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStreet_walker_7556.html" title="User:Street walker">Street walker</a> 12:17, 1 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Please, feel free to point out where I actually called you a "problem".
<ul>
<li>In response to "Again I'm going to say, this is a talk page for Michael Jackson not a talk page for Street walker, and we should be discussing how to improve it, not complaining that it needs improving." you said "Identifying a problem is the first step in finding a solution for it." You can't tell me you weren't trying to say that <i>I</i> was the problem.<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStreet_walker_7556.html" title="User:Street walker">Street walker</a> 21:49, 1 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, I <i>can</i> tell you that. I never labeled <i>you</i> the problem. My point was: in order to discuss how to improve the article, the flaws <i>in the article</i> need to be identified – you seemed to be worried that people were doing too much complaining and not enough discussing. I meant nothing more or less than that. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a></li>

<li>Fair enough, though I think you'll agree that not everyone agrees with his assessment. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The debacle with splitting out the "personal life" section – for the <i>second</i> time, I might add – was roundly criticized.
<ul>
<li>Umm... that wasn't me. That was <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick_7b47.html" title="User:Patrick">User:Patrick</a>.<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStreet_walker_7556.html" title="User:Street walker">Street walker</a> 21:49, 1 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You may not have started it, but you contributed to it, and defended it on AfD, even though you were the one who started the <i>first</i> fork, which was also shot down. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't get me wrong, here. Up until that point, your edits to the article were largely of good quality. I just think you need to take a step back and attempt to look at the article and its subject from a more <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a> perspective. That's all. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 13:19, 1 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, thank you, and I will take your advice.<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStreet_walker_7556.html" title="User:Street walker">Street walker</a> 21:49, 1 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Good. I hope we can work constructively from here on out. Unfortunately, I have very little time to do so, so my input to the article will mostly consist of advice and general suggestions for the time being. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 21:58, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi... would appreciate if you'd watch <a href="../../../m/e/s/Template_talk%7EMesopotamian_mythology_84ce.html" title="Template talk:Mesopotamian mythology">Template talk:Mesopotamian mythology</a>, <a href="../../../e/e/n/Talk%7EEenasul_Fateh_fe45.html" title="Talk:Eenasul Fateh">Talk:Eenasul Fateh</a> and <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive68_8d2e.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive68">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive68</a>, as Elonka has recently targeted these three especially to remove the things she considers personal attacks... i.e. censoring comments she considers to be less than flattering of herself while making strong personal attacks on other people herself and encouraging others to do so as well. Phil Welch has threatened to block me if I undo her edits, but David Gerard and others opposed him on that. It's absolutely ridiculous that Elonka thinks she can get away with this.<a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 18:52, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Phil Welch is not only still supporting her despite numerous admins and David Gerard saying the idea was bad, but he apparently reverted and locked <a href="../../../m/e/s/Template_talk%7EMesopotamian_mythology_84ce.html" title="Template talk:Mesopotamian mythology">Template talk:Mesopotamian mythology</a> to her version. This is yet another rogue admin who needs to be stopped immediately. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 19:33, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yikes. Let Gerard know.

<dd>I let lots of people know, nobody is doing anything. She then moved onto another page, <a href="../../../e/e/n/Talk%7EEenasul_Fateh_fe45.html" title="Talk:Eenasul Fateh">Talk:Eenasul Fateh</a>, putting in the edit comments that she supposedly was doing so under the direction of the admin board, which of course is another lie. One person I tried contacting for help, the Haukar guy she also accused of being my sockpuppet, suggests some neutral third party to agree on what gets "refactored" -- no, duh, nothing needs to be refactored, what the hell.</dd>

</dl>
</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Amusingly enough, I popped onto the talkpage for the aladdin magician article the fight started on and the people there are now finding more proof that the guy forged his credentials and lied and etc., just like I said from the very beginning, and then one of my most vocal openents supporting Elonka is denying it and calling people names for bringing it up... And people wondered why I suspected extra sockpuppets after the first ones were caught.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>

<dd>So I am right on that, I am right on Elonka's lies, supposedly people don't want to cave into Elonka's ridiculous demands, yet she's merrily going along doing it anyway and being helped along.

<p>Hi Android and sorry to bother you with a long post. You made a couple of comments on <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a> regarding the presumed sockpuppets <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinktulip_9746.html" title="User:Pinktulip">User:Pinktulip</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/a/User%7EEmact_6a19.html" title="User:Emact">User:Emact</a> and <a href="../../../f/p/l/User%7EFplay_2ef0.html" title="User:Fplay">User:Fplay</a>. You said you had nothing to say about recent behaviour but I'm very much hoping a disinterested admin can look into Pinktulip's talk posts. He continually revises his posts so there's no one diff I can present but perhaps you can read down from <a href="../../../t/e/r/Talk%7ETerri_Schiavo_fd37.html#Marskell_is_becoming_destructive" title="Talk:Terri Schiavo">Talk:Terri Schiavo#Marskell is becoming destructive</a>. I don't mind sarcasm but the repeated references to where I live are off-putting:</p>
<ul>
<li>"while a Canadian citizen, he prefers to live in country that does not know Democracy. Perhaps his time over there has effected his judgement in some adverse way."</li>
<li>"Is he spending too much time with those heathens in the UAE or something?</li>
<li>"pulling strings on the Admin notice board, and controlling our view of the information from your desert fortress. Come back to Democracy."</li>
</ul>
<p>And then there's basic silly stuff "STUPID STUPID STUPID," "crazy," "information-detroying," ignorance-spreading" etc. He also seems to like to drop "nigger-lover" into conversation when he can as you'll note in the last post there. He's been warned gently by Proto <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Pinktulip&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=38679279" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Pinktulip&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=38679279" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and more sharply by Tom Harrison <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=38697282" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=38697282" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> along with a few people stopping by with "take it easy" comments.

<p>Hi Android. Could you take take care of the talk pages too? Also, am I right that there isn't a better place to than <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a> to get page moves like that undone?

<dd>Hm, that's odd, I thought I took care of the talk pages. I'll fix that straight away. As for reporting these sorts of things, page-move vandalism is urgent enough to report on ANI, in my opinion, especially when it involves a possibly-compromised account. Also, rapid page-move vandalism generally indicates a bot attack, which is even <i>more</i> urgent. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 17:57, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry I removed the protection template on Norm Coleman. Is there a way for non-admins to check whether something is protected or not, without logging out and making a test edit (which would probably be seen as vandalism)?

<dd>No problem; since there's no way (AFAICT) for non-admins to determine the status of the page, I don't blame you.

<p>Hi, thanks for taking action with my account. Unfortunately, someone <i>has</i> guessed my password and is using the account for vandalism. They have now changed the password and I cannot do anything about it. I have asked someone who knows me personally to block the account. If you're around and want to do so beforehand, please do. If you need to confirm that I edit from this IP, you can request a CheckUser, but really there's no need. The other guy can't even spell "carried".

<p>Thanks for that. How can I email myself a new password? I don't know what the vandal changed it to. Unfortunately I didn't notice what he'd done in time to change it before he could. Not to worry.

<p>I saw your comments on his talk page. He also made a round of vandalism against DreamGuy's usual pages. Don't you think it would be best not to acknowledge his edits in any way besides reverting them, though? He's beyond penalty now - he can't be banned any more than he aleady is - and getting any form of attention is probably a pleasure for him. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 19:11, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi again Esperanzians! Well, since our last frolic in the realms of news, the Advisory Council has met twice more (see <b><a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_ACM2_d652.html" title="WP:ESP/ACM2">WP:ESP/ACM2</a></b> and <b><a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_ACM3_e83b.html" title="WP:ESP/ACM3">WP:ESP/ACM3</a></b>). As a result, <b><a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_CHA_cf77.html" title="WP:ESP/CHA">the charter</a> has been ammended</b> twice (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AEsperanza%2FCharter&amp;diff=39263854&amp;oldid=33097525" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AEsperanza%2FCharter&amp;diff=39263854&amp;oldid=33097525" rel="nofollow">here</a> for details) and all of the shortcuts have been standardised (see the <a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_ACM2_d652.html" title="WP:ESP/ACM2">summary</a> for more details).

Also, <b>the spamlist has been dissolved</b> - all Esperanzians will now recieve this update "newsletter".</p>
<p>The other major notice I need to tell you about is the upcoming <b>Esperanza Advisory Council Elections</b>.

<p>I would like to request that the deletion you made of "Jochen Dieckfoss" be reversed. Since I noticed there was a warning placed on the page, I did in fact put a hold in the code so an explanation could be posted. Instead, you went ahead and deleted it before a response could be made. The entry was not just pop-culture and Jochen was in fact an All-American collegiate runner at Boston University. While I did not write the entry, I know all of its contents to be truthful.</p>

<dd>Well, the <i>best</i> way would be to use &lt;noinclude&gt;{{deletedpage}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;, which looks like a blank page when transcluded but like {{<a href="../../../d/e/l/Template%7EDeletedpage_0567.html" title="Template:Deletedpage">deletedpage</a>}} when used directly.

I think we need to unban the IP's somehow because they access wiki at school (<a href="../../../l/e/t/Lethbridge_Collegiate_Institute_cbf7.html" title="Lethbridge Collegiate Institute">Lethbridge Collegiate Institute</a>) and are creating havoc because no one else at school can edit. You can let Friday know about the situation. You can look up my contribs and see that I've been here for a while.

<dd>I believe the autoblock will expire in 24 hours, unless something can be done about it sooner. It just seemed like juvenile vandalism to me, I don't see a reason to be particularly harsh on them either. But, we can't just do nothing, so if it continues, I bet people will continue to block. I think the best thing to do is encourage these guys to just cut it out. If they want one, have them start a <a href="http://wikicities.org" class="external text" title="http://wikicities.org" rel="nofollow">wikicities</a> account for the school or something, they can write about food fights there all day long. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 04:50, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would appreciate if you can do something about the personal attacks I suffer daily on Wikipedia from Haham Hanuka. I am a bona fida contributor in vandalism addressing, rewriting extremely sensitive articles, dispute resolution, pov addressing, categorization, renaming and deleting categories and articles with over 6,000 edits and an excellent edit history also on the Dutch Wikipedia (well over 20,000 edits). I am sorry I even have to say this about myself. Hanuka does not work by our policies and is already indefinitely blocked at the Hebrew Wikipedia.

<dd>Yes, Haham Hauka got me a while ago into my first 3RR trap in 3 years on Wikipedia. I was very shortly blocked by William M. Connolly. I think others had been more understanding of the difficulties addressing these kind of issues. This was a Saturday so the usual people who know me and him were not around. The unpleasant experience was that this admin later made weird allegations against me, unrelated to the 3RR. I wrote to him about it but he deleted my postings and he kept referring to the 3RR. I was quite embarrassed that an admin would imply such things about me, both on my personal talk page and an article talk page. What to do? I do want to run for admin myself, but only after this sinks and someone nominates me. I have been fighting vandalism so long just with my regular keyboard. I will wait longer because of this affair. Perhaps I should let it rest, he is a very efficient and hard working admin and can probably get away with it. Perhaps the damage was not so bad. The other articles are Yitzhak Rabin, Yitzhak Rabin assassination conspiracy theories, Assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, Yoram Rubin and Hagai Amir. Perhaps there are more. Anything that links to the unused assassination template by Toya. The unpleasant encounter with WMC was I think on the conspiracies talk page. It was an obvious mistake, but I was offended by his attitude about it. I hope I will do better as an admin, but that remains to be seen. I am a social science person. Haham Hanuka is not even my most difficult costumer. The other one is David Rutstein, but he is so far out there, that he always gets reverted. Thanks for your kind offer!

<dd>I removed the comments and kept just the summary given by the people who expressed an opinion. Admittedly R. fiend is just listed once. I was just wondering how you arrived at the conclusion that "For posterity's sake, I find that around 60% of the participants in this discussion alone (I did not tally the other discussions) favor deletion or endorse the status quo (maintaining the content in projectspace)." -- User:Docu</dd>

<dd>I explained this in my closing: <i>However, I find that a few of the undelete "votes" are based on faulty assumptions or arguments, and many of them express opinions that I find are compatible with the status quo.</i> My decision was not based on the numbers, so this discussion is entirely academic, anyway. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 04:28, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just for the Academics: did you discard 15 of the 22 "restore to article namespace" opinions to arrive at the 60% or did you also discard some of the "keep deleted"? Bearing in mind that the discussion had taken place when the list was already in Wikipedia namespace, which opinions did you consider being compatible with keeping a list in Wikipedia namespace? -- User:Docu</dd>
