	    <p>Hello there Andy, I was just wondering where you managed to find the 2001 population statistics for individual town's.

<dd>Scouse = Liverpool: I've added it. I'm no language expert but the seven families of accents I cited are often distinguished by English (UK) stand-up-commedians for example, so I think it's safe to point them out. I've added to <a href="../../../d/i/s/Distinguishing_accents_in_English_4709.html" title="Distinguishing accents in English">Distinguishing accents in English</a> and there's a little description there. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndy_G_ad96.html" title="User:Andy G">Andy G</a> 20:40, 7 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Andy, in response to your question, "Is this right? Domnonia &amp; Cornouaille sound very like Dumnonia and Cornwall - part of the Brythonic culture but not part of Brittany." -- tres bizarre, but true! My source is Myles Dillon &amp; Nora Chadwick, <i>The Celtic Realms</i>, but I've seen these names of the Breton kingdoms in other places. If I understand the scholarship correctly, this has spawned disagreements over the origins of these names: were they Medieval English (i.e., the Sassons from beyond the Tamar &amp; Severn) coinages, or derived from earlier, prehistoric Celtic names, or perchance the Breton kingdoms borrowed the names currently in use from beyond the Channel? The only certainty in this dispute is that there are far more opinions than evidence. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 04:43, 9 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, point taken, the region bundaries don't fit the current ceremonial counties. But come to that, why bring in counties at all? The page for the Region can say what 1974 counties were involved. It just seems confucing to mix current districts with expired conties. If anything surely we should list the current adiministrative counties (labelled as such) in the panel. Maybe just the non-unitary ones. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndy_G_ad96.html" title="User:Andy G">Andy G</a> 19:26, 26 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Re: Berkshire. The confusion here is one introduced by the propagandists of the ABC. They equate 'county councils' and 'administrative counties' and pretend that the latter cannot exist without the other. Berkshire is not in ISO 3166:GB because ISO 3166:GB makes no pretense at representing counties. It represents top-level local authority areas, and Berkshire is certainly not one of these, nor are <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Manchester_23f4.html" title="Greater Manchester">Greater Manchester</a> or <a href="../../../t/y/n/Tyne_and_Wear_1c8b.html" title="Tyne and Wear">Tyne and Wear</a>, as their county councils have been abolished. This is not the same however as abolishing the county. The article <a href="../../../a/d/m/Administrative_counties_of_England_ab3c.html" title="Administrative counties of England">Administrative counties of England</a> I have clarified - the map was already correct. You will note that the link you found on the talk page when you originally questioned whether say, Milton Keynes was in law a county, refers to the 'County of Berkshire' in the present tense. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> 20:20, Mar 3, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please don't use en-dashes on Wikipedia as you did at <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mini.html" title="Mini">Mini</a>. The very minor difference in readability is not worth the greater editing difficulty and lack of uniform support. Just use hyphens.</p>
<p>The case is different for em-dashes, where at least there IS a great readability and appearance improvement if one uses proper em-dashes.

<p>Sorry to butt in but i noticed a conversation you had on the British isles discussion page where you referred to the Book "The Isles" by Norman Davis. Can i recommend to you two books on Cornish history. Mark Stoyle "West Britons, Cornish identities in th early modern period" Philip Payton "Cornwall a History" Both excellent and place the Cornish in their rightful context as a distinct peoples of the Atlantic Archipelago. <a href="../../../f/u/l/User%7EFulub_Le_Breton_6494.html" title="User:Fulub Le Breton">Fulub le Breton</a> 6/02/05</p>

<p>Hello Andy: I just found a 1971 Elliott Clock with a brass label on the back. It says&#160;:</p>
<pre>
 Rolls-Royce (1971) LTD.
 BRISTOL Engine Division
 G. G. BRODIE
 1971
</pre>
<p>So it seems that Yes! the Rolls Royce Company was called "Rolls-Royce (1971)LTD."</p>
<p>Ann from France (Ann66mb@wanadoo.fr) Can anybody give me details about that? thanks.</p>
