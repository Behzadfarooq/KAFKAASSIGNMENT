<p>Is the preferred spelling not Andrei rather than Andrey? I have no knowledge of the Russian language and how ambiguous such a translation may be, but until now I have only come across Andrei as Kolmogorov's first name. I would like to suggest moving this article and making a redirect from the current page.</p>
<p>Thijs Elenbaas</p>
<p>Andrey is better</p>
<p>// Native russian speaker&#160;:)</p>
<p>There are several standard methods of transliteration. The American Mathematical Society now prefers the version Andrei or in TeX Andre\u\i. 85.118.224.242 14:13, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm Russian, my name is Андрей and I prefer my name to be transliterated as Andrei&#160;:) From <a href="../../../r/o/m/Wikipedia%7ERomanization_of_Russian_2685.html" title="Wikipedia:Romanization of Russian">Wikipedia's transliteration rules</a> follows that we should prefer "Andrey", but there is also stated, that conventional English name (if available) should be used instead of the transliteration. "Andrey" is also used by <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encarta.html" title="Encarta">Encarta</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britannica.html" title="Britannica">Britannica</a>. Due to this I doubt, whether if AMS prefer "Andrei" it's enough to name this variant conventional. Perhaps more sources should be provided here. And please, supply corresponding links, for example, to AMS search results, stats or something like that. <a href="../../../c/m/a/User%7ECmapm_ac09.html" title="User:Cmapm">Cmapm</a> 23:57, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>On the pronunciation question - it is true that unstressed 'o' in Russian comes out more like 'a' (well, short British 'a', anyway).</p>

<p>I personally don't have an opinon and don't know if the allegations of homosexuality are true or not. Obviously, 194.154.84.35 believes they are untrue. Homosexuality in USSR was persecuted (AFAIK a few years in jail). If true, KGB must have known of it. Considering that neither one of them was persecuted, 194.154.84.35 might have a point. I can't find anything useful in google to confirm the allegations. <a href="../../../p/y/r/User%7EPyrop_3814.html" title="User:Pyrop">User:Pyrop</a>: can you actually produce some sort of evidence for your assertions? I am sure you can't produce eye witness accounts, so maybe instead of describing the issue as fact you can describe it as an allegation with references to the sources? Like, "such and such alleges that ...".

<dd>This controversiary info removed by myself until it is proved. Friendship and living in one house does not always mean sex, right? <a href="../../../c/m/a/User%7ECmapm_ac09.html" title="User:Cmapm">Cmapm</a> 13:27, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think it would probably be best if we only stated that the two lived together and had a long friendship, (which is easily comfirmable), until i or someone else can dig up a solid source on it. -<a href="../../../p/y/r/User%7EPyrop_3814.html" title="User:Pyrop">℘yrop</a> <a href="../../../p/y/r/User_talk%7EPyrop_b0e6.html" title="User talk:Pyrop">(talk)</a> 00:09, Jan 18, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I find it sick and disgucting to go into person's sexual life without even having a decent article first. It is encyclopedia, not <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellow_press.html" title="Yellow press">yellow press</a>, for Christ sake. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 01:38, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>First, agreed with <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_s_af0b.html" title="User:Gene s">Gene s</a>. Second, I strongly believe, that the point <a href="../../../p/y/r/User%7EPyrop_3814.html" title="User:Pyrop">Pyrop</a> want to prove in this section is false and he or somebody else will just waste time trying to prove it (it even seems stupid for me), because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kolmogorov had a girlfriend since school times and married to her in 1942, they lived together since then until 1987, when Kolmogorov died. <a href="http://www.kolmogorov.pms.ru/curriculum-vitae.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.kolmogorov.pms.ru/curriculum-vitae.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></li>
<li>It's not Europe or USA today. In the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> at least until 1991 ("at least" because I simply don't know laws of <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a>) this perversion (excuse me for my POV) was a crime against personality, the criminal was sentenced for 5 years (I suppose that before 1920-1950 this time was much longer). I suppose that these people where nearly criminals even in Europe and USA.</li>
<li>Actually, the word in the section header and it's meaning was not known to the majority of people even in big cities of the USSR (may be only to lawyers) during 1922-1991 and particularly during 1920-1950. For example, I myself first knew this word from the media in mid 90-ies. I think in Europe and USA the situation was not much worse.
<ul>
<li>You were a "good boy/girl", then. The word was pretty well-known, especially in its derogatory form, "gomosek". Not to say about a plenty of synonyms, like "pidor", "petuh", etc. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 03:12, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But even if somebody should accidentally find this word somewhere, in any Russian dictionary of that time this word was defined as <b>sexual perversion</b>. And the word <b>love</b> when it was used in "sexual context", meant exclusively relations between male and female.</li>
<li>The purpose of friendship and living together for scientists in the USSR (as I've known reading many biographies) was "to do the same scientific work, do the research in the same area together". May be for scientists in Europe and USA of that time or nowadays it has mostly other meaning? I can't say.</li>
<li>Kolmogorov was the man from the Russian province, in the province and villages of Russia upbringing of people was always much more <i>traditional</i> than in big cities. So, in Kolmogorov's address the word in the header sounds even more stupid than to the one of other scientists.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nothing personal, but <a href="../../../p/y/r/User%7EPyrop_3814.html" title="User:Pyrop">Pyrop</a>, please, next time before including such famous scientists in similar lists and categories (which for some people like myself sounds like "black lists"), base your decision not only on "yellow press"-sources and at least read his biography. <a href="../../../c/m/a/User%7ECmapm_ac09.html" title="User:Cmapm">Cmapm</a> 02:03, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>If there is a desige to continue this general discussion, I suggest you start a (new) article Sex in Soviet Union. As one might remember, during an US-SU "TV-bridge", popular during "perestroika" times, the whole world learned that "there is no sex in Soviet Union".&#160;:-)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I personally think there was just misunderstanding, the synonims of "sex": "pol", "polovoj" were wide-spread in SU. I agree that some of my arguments are my personal POV, I didn't search for any statistical data, because it's not the article "Sex in Soviet Union"&#160;:-) so it isn't worth of serious research. <a href="../../../c/m/a/User%7ECmapm_ac09.html" title="User:Cmapm">Cmapm</a> 14:06, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Indeed it was a misundng, but not what you think. In SU "seks" was a taboo word. When this poor lady called a huge uproar of laughter in the audience by saying that "there is no sex in soviet union" for the whole world to hear, she meant to say that Soviet people were good and decent people of high morality, no one cheated their spouses, that there was no this kind of "bourgeois decay" called by this filthy word "seks". <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 00:56, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>As for the particular case, there is nothing to talk further: either there is evidence, or not. Rumors are inacceptable. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 03:12, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Kolmogorov and Alexandrov also appear on Wikipedia's <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_famous_gay%2C_lesbian_or_bisexual_people.html" title="List of famous gay, lesbian or bisexual people">List of famous gay, lesbian or bisexual people</a>. Should they be removed from it or moved from "Persons of confirmed gay orientation" section to "Persons of disputed gay orientation"? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndris_6e9c.html" title="User:Andris">Andris</a> 23:49, Jan 23, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Remove. "Disputed" means rumors. There is no place in encyclopedia for rumors, unless a person was of importance for gays in some respect. Also, they were added there by user pyrop, who failed to defend his case here, hence no grounds to list in a list. You cannot put something in a list without having this in the directly related article. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 00:46, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Kolmogorov is quoted as saying about Alexandrov "for me these 53 years of close and indissoluble friendship were the reason why all my life was on the whole full of happiness, and the basis of that happiness was the unceasing thoughtfulness on the part of Aleksandrov." which seems to hint at a little more than just 'ordinary' friendship between colleagues. Also Kolmogorov can be found at <a href="http://community.middlebury.edu/~moss/ROL.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://community.middlebury.edu/~moss/ROL.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> a site which maintains a list of (quote) "Famous gay or bisexual Russians or Russians who slept with people of the same sex or had strong romantic attachments". Personally I think the topic of Kolmogorov's relationship with Alexandrov is very interesting and it should at least be mentioned in the Wiki entry that they are considered a gay couple by a lot of people. --62.178.132.203 23:00, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>These "hints" are bullshit. There are plenty of people all over the world of long lasting and fulfilling friendship without sex; even between men and women. Unless there is a direct evidence, this will not go into the article. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 19:50, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Kolmogorov referenced in van Heijenoort published his paper in 1925, which means that that Andrei K. would have been 22 when the paper was <i>published</i>, let alone submitted (given he was born in 1903). Considering the profound complexity of the paper around the use of the <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_of_excluded_middle.html" title="Law of excluded middle">law of excluded middle</a> its hard to believe they came from the same man. However van Heijenoort noted that "professor Kolmogorov signified his acceptance" when the paper was published in van Heijenoort. Perhaps they are father and son? Can someone please confirm?
