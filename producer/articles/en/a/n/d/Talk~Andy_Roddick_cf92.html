<p>Since I've been seeing a lot of IP addresses try to add the rumor about Roddick and Sharapova being together, I have always deleted references to such simply because Roddick and the people around him have already said things to the effect of denying the "romantic link." Note that the articles that claim Roddick and Sharapova together state that they have been seen spending time together and infer the relationship from there. But when people actually talk to Roddick, or people in the pro tennis world talk, they say it's not true. See the ESPN interview with Chris Fowler from Andy Roddick's official website <a href="http://www.andyroddick.com/photosvideos/video-espn-interview-011906/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.andyroddick.com/photosvideos/video-espn-interview-011906/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and Justin Gimelstob's Sports Illustrated column <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/writers/justin_gimelstob/01/20/gimel.jinx/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/writers/justin_gimelstob/01/20/gimel.jinx/index.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. <a href="../../../n/o/e/User%7ENoelledeg_d84c.html" title="User:Noelledeg">Noelle De Guzman</a> 01:07, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Regardless of what they claim in public, it does not mean that it isn't encyclopedic and shouldn't be included. It's ALL OVER the media. The post doesn't say it's true, it says it's speculation and it is. Speculation can be encyclopedic, as long as it's based in some fact. They have been spending a lot of time together, and it should be noted on this site. Your efforts to stifle any reporting of this are hiding this simple fact. See what comes of it, and if nothing does it will be deleted in time, but while newsworthy, the information should be reported truthfully. That's why I added the link of him denying it. No one is claiming that it's actually true, only specultation based on facts...the facts being that they've been spending a lot of time together. Truthteller.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Very well, then. I didn't like deleting stuff off the article page especially since so many people kept adding it. That's why I opened up this section on the Talk page so that we could have some meaningful discussion about it. I'll try to improve the wording about the alleged relationship instead so that it makes reference to actual events and not just speculation on the source's part.</dd>

<p>Truthteller: if you read the 'reports' carefully it says that Maria Sharapova had a Motorola event in the same hotel in Melbourne where Roddick was playing poker for charity. Maria watched that game. There is nothing more to it. Considering the FACT that they denied the rumours of a relationship you can safely say that putting these things on here is just publishing gossip.</p>
<p>It's pretty much fact that they are a couple. Sharapova was asked about it and she did not deny it, she just asked that they stick to tennis and not talk about personal matters. But I agree, it doesn't really belong in this article until they go public with it.</p>
<p>Well, we can put the rumours to rest because Andy Roddick officially denied at the 2006 US Open that they are a couple. "We're not dating" is his exact quote. Sharapova does not talk about her personal life so will not deny nor confirm but said that "when two players know eachother and are friends, people are going to talk, that's what happened here." Sharapova is still single and Roddick is rumoured to have a girlfriend in Austin since April 2006.</p>

<p>"ESPN 2 commentator Mary Carillo called Roddick "a one dimensional player" MSNBC columnist Bud Collins in an article published in January 2006 during the Australian Open questioned Roddick's abilities.

<p>I removed the following section from the main article as it is POV. I'm suggesting a rewrite that does not offer so much opinion and commentary.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"However, in February 10th at the Davis Cup Roddick choked this match against world no. 82 Andre Pavel of Romania. Pavel fought back from two sets down and match point in the third set tiebreaker to beat Roddick. Roddick became ill and vomited in a bucket during changeovers. Roddick claims he wasn't nervous or embarassed caused the vomiting. Bud Collins interview with Roddick also was considered hostile because Collins openly criticized Roddick for changing coaches. Roddick was angered by Collins harsh Jan 22nd 2006 article on MSNBC.COM."</dd>

<p>Calling the fact that Roddick didn't lie about the status of the ball being in is not worthy of praise, since we all have a moral obligation not to lie. By praising him for telling the truth you are implying that the NORM for athletes is to LIE, a sentiment that many professional athletes would find VERY offensive. And besides, Roddick said that the umpire was about to check out the ball mark anyway so he was just saving time. I thus took out that part and changed it accordingly. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStanley011_1b51.html" title="User:Stanley011">User:Stanley011</a></p>

<p>Flute138: I have no idea what you meant by the following: "(sorry Tennis expert, but I was under the impression that the change the IP address made was part of the current standard (you agreed that the changes made were fine.) So rv, in hopes of clarification)" Maybe I have a faulty memory, but where did I agree that the IP address's changes were fine? It's not that I think the changes are NOT fine (sorry for the double negative), but they are not consistent with the other timelines in other pages. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETennis_expert_6664.html" title="User:Tennis expert">Tennis expert</a> 01:34, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry if I was unclear, but a while back (when the whole argument was brought up, and you came up with the new colors), I showed you (on the Venus Williams page) the change with the surface record background colors, which I assumed you agreed with, and would be used in future timelines.

<p>Hey when i was looking through the tennis career it says that Andy Roddick is the second-youngest world no.1 behind only Hewitt. This is not true. Marat Safin is. Roddick was 21 years and 3 months old when he became no. 1. Marat Safin was 20 years, 10 months old. I changed it and later when i checked back it said roddick was second youngest. Im just wondering what is going on.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.109.203.27_48ce.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.109.203.27">24.109.203.27</a> (talk) 23:33, March 6, 2007 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>Wow this is getting confusing. They don't even mention Marat Safin being world No. 1 in the career review. It just says that he was 15 points away from year-end number one. But wikipedia confirms that he held number one in 2000 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ATP_number_1_ranked_players" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ATP_number_1_ranked_players" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. I think ATPtennis.com is making a error. It sure looks like Marat Safin is the second youngest. But right now, I have no idea. I think we should delete Roddick is second youngest until we resolve this situation. <a href="../../../s/s/j/User%7ESsjbooger_f4ab.html" title="User:Ssjbooger">Ssjbooger</a>

Well, can you list the dates when both became number one and find out how exactly old they were at that time?
