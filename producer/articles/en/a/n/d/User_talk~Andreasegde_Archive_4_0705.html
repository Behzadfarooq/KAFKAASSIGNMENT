<p>Just a bit of advice on style: try to lighten up on the use of dashes. Some useful guidelines appear <a href="http://www.lousywriter.com/punctuation_dash.php" class="external text" title="http://www.lousywriter.com/punctuation_dash.php" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The gist is "The Dash is generally confined to cases where there is a sudden break from the general run of the passage.

<dd>I've just started Freddie Lennon, and it's going to be finished in two days or so. I think The Beatles is almost up to GA now - it just needs a bit more work.

<p>Found myself on your user page, and linked to the above (ah, memories). My 16 year old son asked me what I was chuckling at! Needless to say, he laughed his socks off.

<p>What is your explanation for prematurely removing <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Manilow_5266.html" title="Barry Manilow">Barry Manilow</a> from the GA nomination? The current feedback on 1/14/07 was for the FIRST NOMINATION and has since been implemented and resubmitted for a SECOND NOMINATION on 1/25/07. You left no feedback on the Talk page so I am presuming that you mistakenly thought that the 1/14/07 feedback was new. In the future, do not remove other nominations without first grading them yourself to move up your own two nominations placed. It is nasty. 151.204.213.250</p>
<dl>
<dd>Because it was failed for GA. I found this on the talk page:</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Failed GA nom</b> On several fronts, this article is good - it is accurate, broad in coverage, relatively NPOV (although there is a lot of puffy language - "Manilow got the century off to a good start" etc - not a lot, but glowing language is not the best.) etc. etc - - - - Good luck!-<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 17:16, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<p>No it is not good enough. It is relevant to review how far the article has improved since last looked over by reading somebody else's feedback. Not to reuse somebody else's feedback as your own for an article you probably never read -- to move up your own articles. I reput it back up for consideration since you were in err in taking it down in the first place and actually left none of your own about the current content of the article. 151.204.213.250 18:16, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Look, I will be really honest about this: I thought that it had failed its GA nom, and the reviewing editor had forgotten to take it off the GA nom page. I sent a message to the editor in question to ask him, but got no reply. If I took it off mistakenly, then I truly, and deeply, apologise. It was not my intention to move my articles up—not in any way, shape, or form. (I think Barry is nice article, BTW.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I apologise again. I shall now thrash myself with a big stick. Good luck with the GA nom. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasegde_c4ec.html" title="User:Andreasegde">andreasegde</a> 18:22, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If it was an honest mistake, ok. It's fixed. Good luck with your articles as well and please don't hurt yourself. 151.204.213.250 18:31, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hi, sorry there was confusion here. As indicated, I failed the article on 1/14, apparently it has been put back up as a nominee a second time. No harm done. Also, why did you title your post on my talk page "accusation"? -<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 21:51, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for your helpful feedback on the Barry Manilow page, as well as contacting the rater from before. I appreciate all your help with combining the paragraphs or sentences from the same year. With Manilow it's a bit tough with the prose since his life is his career with his albums and television specials being a nice part of it. Thanks again. 151.204.213.250 18:26, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>As part of my editorial duties in reporting all that I know that has happened in the WikiFab world I have mentioned the Macca FA nom&amp;fail.

<p>If you feel that <i>drastic</i> chopping and splitting is <b>a</b> way to go then I would strongly suggest you mention it at the talkpage. Otherwise you will either be in danger of violating the three revert rule as people try to repair the "<i>damage</i>" you are causing, or you will spend more time explaining yourself than editing.
