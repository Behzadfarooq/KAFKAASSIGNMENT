<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrea_Dworkin_4ba1.html" title="Edit section: Life in the Netherlands">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Life in the Netherlands</span></h2>
<p>Dworkin graduated from <a href="../../../b/e/n/Bennington_College_1607.html" title="Bennington College">Bennington College</a>, a women's college, with a degree in Literature in 1969, and moved to <a href="../../../a/m/s/Amsterdam.html" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> to interview Dutch <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchists</a> in the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provo.html" title="Provo">Provo</a> countercultural movement.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> While in Amsterdam, she became involved with, and then married, one of the anarchists that she met. Soon after they were married, he began to abuse her severely: punching and kicking her, burning her with cigarettes, beating her on her legs with a wooden beam, and banging her head against the floor until he knocked her unconscious (<i>Heartbreak</i>, 119; <i>Letters from a War Zone</i>, 103, 332).</p>
<p>After she left her husband late in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a>, she spent a year caught in the Netherlands, where her ex-husband "attacked, persecuted, followed, harassed" her, beating her and threatening her whenever he found where she was hiding.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> She found herself desperate for money, often homeless, thousands of miles from home and family, later remarking that "I often lived the life of a fugitive, except that it was the more desperate life of a <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battered_woman.html" title="Battered woman">battered woman</a> who had run away for the last time, whatever the outcome".<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> For a while, she worked as a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prostitution.html" title="Prostitution">prostitute</a> in order to survive. A feminist and fellow expatriate, Ricki Abrams, offered her help, sheltered her in Abrams's home, and helped her find places to stay on houseboats, a communal farm, and deserted buildings <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> while Dworkin hid from her former husband and tried to work up the money to return to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>.</p>
<p>Abrams introduced Dworkin to early radical feminist writing from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, and Dworkin was especially inspired by <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kate_Millett_57ac.html" title="Kate Millett">Kate Millett</a>'s <i><a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_Politics_8c4a.html" title="Sexual Politics">Sexual Politics</a></i>, <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shulamith_Firestone_88bc.html" title="Shulamith Firestone">Shulamith Firestone</a>'s <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dialectic_of_Sex_b85f.html" title="The Dialectic of Sex">The Dialectic of Sex</a></i>, and <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Morgan_d74a.html" title="Robin Morgan">Robin Morgan</a>'s <i><a href="../../../s/i/s/Sisterhood_is_Powerful_e73a.html" title="Sisterhood is Powerful">Sisterhood is Powerful</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> She and Abrams began to work together on "early pieces and fragments" of a radical feminist text on the hatred of women in culture and history,<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> including a completed draft of a chapter on the pornographic counterculture magazine <i>Suck</i>, which was published by a group of fellow expatriates in the Netherlands.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Dworkin later wrote that she eventually agreed to help smuggle a briefcase of <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heroin.html" title="Heroin">heroin</a> through customs in return for $1,000 and an airplane ticket, thinking that if she was not caught she could return home with the ticket and the money, or if she was caught, she could escape her ex-husband by going to prison. The deal for the briefcase fell through, but the man who had promised her the money gave her the airline ticket, and she was able to return to the United States in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Before she left Amsterdam, Dworkin talked with Abrams about her experiences in the Netherlands, the emerging feminist movement, and the book they had begun to write together. Dworkin agreed to complete the book—which she eventually titled <i>Woman Hating</i>—and get it published when she reached the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> In her memoirs, Dworkin relates that during that conversation, she vowed to dedicate her life to the feminist movement:</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>Sitting with Ricki, talking with Ricki, I made a vow to her: that I would use everything I knew, including from prostitution, to make the women's movement stronger and better; that I'd give my life to the movement and for the movement. I promised to be honor-bound to the well-being of women, to do anything necessary for that well-being. I promised to live and to die if need be for women. I made that vow some thirty years ago, and I have not betrayed it yet.</p>

<p>When she returned to <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>, Dworkin brought back the "early pieces and fragments" of <i>Woman Hating</i>, and took odd jobs to support herself while she expanded and finished the book. <i>Woman Hating</i> became Dworkin's first published book in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a>. It offered radical feminist analyses of <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fairy_tale.html" title="Fairy tale">fairy tales</a> and literary pornography, which Dworkin argued presented women as passive, dependent, and defined by a male sexuality that eroticized women's humiliation and submission. It then discussed "gynocidal" expressions of that view of femininity, in the form of European <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witch_hunt.html" title="Witch hunt">witch hunts</a> and Chinese <a href="../../../f/o/o/Foot_binding.html" title="Foot binding">foot binding</a>. Dworkin argued that binary <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gender_role.html" title="Gender role">gender roles</a> were a myth, expressed in the stories and enforced by the violence, that could and should be overcome, in favor of an "<a href="../../../a/n/d/Androgynous.html" title="Androgynous">androgynous</a> society," for the sake of women's freedom and human flourishing.</p>
<p>In New York, Dworkin worked again as an antiwar organizer, participated in demonstrations for <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesbian.html" title="Lesbian">lesbian</a> rights and against <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">apartheid</a> in <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup> The feminist poet <a href="../../../m/u/r/Muriel_Rukeyser_afb7.html" title="Muriel Rukeyser">Muriel Rukeyser</a> hired her as an assistant (Dworkin later said "I was the worst assistant in the history of the world. But Muriel kept me on because she believed in me as a writer".<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup>) Dworkin also joined a feminist <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consciousness_raising.html" title="Consciousness raising">consciousness raising</a> group,<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup> and soon became involved in <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radical_feminism.html" title="Radical feminism">radical feminist</a> organizing, focusing on campaigns against violence against women. In addition to her writing and activism, Dworkin gained notoriety as a speaker, mostly for events organized by local feminist groups.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup> She became well-known for passionate, uncompromising speeches that aroused strong feelings in both supporters and critics, and inspired her audience to action, such as her speech at the first <a href="../../../t/a/k/Take_Back_the_Night_3070.html" title="Take Back the Night">Take Back the Night</a> march in November 1978, and her <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a> speech at the Midwest Regional Conference of the National Organization for Changing Men (now the National Organization for Men Against Sexism, <a href="http://www.nomas.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nomas.org" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>) entitled "<a href="http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/WarZoneChaptIIIE.html" class="external text" title="http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/WarZoneChaptIIIE.html" rel="nofollow">I Want a Twenty-Four Hour Truce During Which There Is No Rape</a>." <a href="../../../g/l/o/Gloria_Steinem_5452.html" title="Gloria Steinem">Gloria Steinem</a> repeatedly compared her strident style to the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Testament_79e6.html" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a> prophets;<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup> <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susan_Brownmiller_c6cb.html" title="Susan Brownmiller">Susan Brownmiller</a> recalls her <a href="../../../t/a/k/Take_Back_the_Night_3070.html" title="Take Back the Night">Take Back the Night</a> speech in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>Saturday evening culminated in a candlelit "Take Back the Night" march (the first of its kind) through the porn district, kicked off by an exhortation by Andrea Dworkin. I'd seen Andrea in my living room, but this was the first time I'd seen Andrea in action. On the spot I dubbed her Rolling Thunder. Perspiring in her trademark denim coveralls, she employed the rhetorical cadences that would make her both a cult idol and an object of ridicule a few years later. Dworkin's dramatized martyrdom and revival-tent theatrics never sat well with me, but I retained my respect for her courage long after I absented myself from the pornography wars. Her call to action accomplished, three thousand demonstrators took to the streets ...</p>

They became close friends and eventually came to live together. Stoltenberg wrote a series of radical feminist books and articles on masculinity. Although Dworkin publicly wrote "I love John with my heart and soul"<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[17]</a></sup> and Stoltenberg described Dworkin as "the love of my life",<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[18]</a></sup> she continued to publicly identify herself as <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesbian.html" title="Lesbian">lesbian</a>, and he as <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay.html" title="Gay">gay</a>. Dworkin described him as a "nongenital man," paying reference to the fact that they chose together not to have penetrative sex. Stoltenberg, recounting the perplexity that their relationship seemed to cause people in the press,<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[19]</a></sup> summarized the relationship by saying "So I state only the simplest facts publicly: yes, Andrea and I live together and love each other and we are each other's life partner, and yes we are both out."</p>
<p>Dworkin and Stoltenberg were married in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>; after her death, Stoltenberg said "It's why we never told anybody really that we married, because people get confused about that.

Her critique of pornography began with <i>Woman Hating</i>, in which she offered a critical analysis of the contemporary pornography, in the novels <i><a href="../../../s/t/o/Story_of_O_c801.html" title="Story of O">Story of O</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Image_%28novel%29_55b8.html" title="The Image (novel)">L'Image</a></i>, and in the counterculture pornographic newspaper <i>Suck</i>. Dworkin argued that pornography presented the adult and explicit development of the sexual politics expressed implicitly for children in <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fairy_tale.html" title="Fairy tale">fairy tales</a>, and that it portrayed women as passive victims, whose identity was expressed in eroticized degradation, humiliation, or outright violence.</p>
<p>In February 1976, Dworkin took a leading role in organizing public pickets of <i><a href="../../../s/n/u/Snuff_%281975_film%29.html" title="Snuff (1975 film)">Snuff</a></i> in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> and, during the fall, joined <a href="../../../a/d/r/Adrienne_Rich_921c.html" title="Adrienne Rich">Adrienne Rich</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grace_Paley_5e98.html" title="Grace Paley">Grace Paley</a>, <a href="../../../g/l/o/Gloria_Steinem_5452.html" title="Gloria Steinem">Gloria Steinem</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shere_Hite_9f9c.html" title="Shere Hite">Shere Hite</a>, Lois Gould, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Deming_7d1f.html" title="Barbara Deming">Barbara Deming</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karla_Jay_81a8.html" title="Karla Jay">Karla Jay</a>, Letty Pogrebin, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Morgan_d74a.html" title="Robin Morgan">Robin Morgan</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susan_Brownmiller_c6cb.html" title="Susan Brownmiller">Susan Brownmiller</a> in attempts to form a radical feminist antipornography group.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[21]</a></sup> Members of this group would go on to found <a href="../../../w/o/m/Women_Against_Pornography_6b71.html" title="Women Against Pornography">Women Against Pornography</a> in 1979, but by then Dworkin had begun to distance herself from the group over differences in approach.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[22]</a></sup> Dworkin spoke at the first <a href="../../../t/a/k/Take_Back_the_Night_3070.html" title="Take Back the Night">Take Back the Night</a> march in November 1978, and joined 3,000 women in a march through the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red-light_district.html" title="Red-light district">red-light district</a> of <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_a4a4.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> (Brownmiller 391-392).</p>
<p>In 1979, Dworkin published <a href="http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/PornAList.html" class="external text" title="http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/PornAList.html" rel="nofollow"><i>Pornography: Men Possessing Women</i></a>, which analyzes (and extensively cites examples drawn from) contemporary and historical pornography as an industry of woman-hating dehumanization. Dworkin argues that it is implicated in violence against women, both in its production (through the abuse of the women used to star in it), and in the social consequences of its consumption by encouraging men to eroticize the domination, humiliation, and abuse of women.</p>

Boreman made her charges public for the press corps at a press conference, with Dworkin, feminist lawyer <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catharine_MacKinnon_f828.html" title="Catharine MacKinnon">Catharine MacKinnon</a>, and members of <a href="../../../w/o/m/Women_Against_Pornography_6b71.html" title="Women Against Pornography">Women Against Pornography</a>. After the press conference, Dworkin, MacKinnon, <a href="../../../g/l/o/Gloria_Steinem_5452.html" title="Gloria Steinem">Gloria Steinem</a>, and Boreman began discussing the possibility of using federal <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_rights.html" title="Civil rights">civil rights</a> law to seek damages from Traynor and the makers of <i>Deep Throat</i>. Boreman was interested, but backed off after Steinem discovered that the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statute_of_limitations.html" title="Statute of limitations">statute of limitations</a> for a possible suit had passed (Brownmiller 337).</p>
<p>Dworkin and MacKinnon, however, continued to discuss civil rights litigation as a possible approach to combatting pornography. In the fall of <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>, MacKinnon secured a one-semester appointment for Dworkin at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Minnesota_1d57.html" title="University of Minnesota">University of Minnesota</a>, to teach a course in literature for the <a href="../../../w/o/m/Women%27s_Studies_9bd9.html" title="Women's Studies">Women's Studies</a> program and co-teach (with MacKinnon) an interdepartmental course on pornography, where they hashed out details of a civil rights approach. With encouragement from community activists in south <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minneapolis.html" title="Minneapolis">Minneapolis</a>, the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minneapolis.html" title="Minneapolis">Minneapolis</a> city government hired Dworkin and MacKinnon to draft an <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antipornography_civil_rights_ordinance.html" title="Antipornography civil rights ordinance">antipornography civil rights ordinance</a> as an amendment to the Minneapolis city <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_rights.html" title="Civil rights">civil rights</a> ordinance. The amendment defined pornography as a <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_rights.html" title="Civil rights">civil rights</a> violation against women, and allowed women who claimed harm from pornography to <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawsuit.html" title="Lawsuit">sue</a> the producers and distributors in <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_law_%28common_law%29.html" title="Civil law (common law)">civil court</a> for damages. The law was passed twice by the Minneapolis city council but vetoed by Mayor Don Fraser, who considered the wording of the ordinance to be too vague.

<p>On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_22.html" title="January 22">January 22</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>, Dworkin testified for half an hour before the <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attorney_General%27s_Commission_on_Pornography_b41b.html" title="Attorney General's Commission on Pornography">Attorney General's Commission on Pornography</a> (sometimes referred to as the "Meese Commission") in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>, and answered questions from commissioners after completing her testimony (<i>Letters from a War Zone</i>, 276; a transcript is reprinted as "Pornography Is A Civil Rights Issue", pp. 276-307). Dworkin's testimony against pornography was praised and reprinted in the Commission's final report,<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[23]</a></sup> and Dworkin and MacKinnon marked its release by holding a joint press conference.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[24]</a></sup> Meese Commission officials went on to successfully demand that convenience store chains remove from shelves popular men's magazines such as <i><a href="../../../p/l/a/Playboy_%28magazine%29.html" title="Playboy (magazine)">Playboy</a></i> (Dworkin wrote that the magazine "in both text and pictures promotes both rape and child sexual abuse")<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[25]</a></sup> and <i><a href="../../../p/e/n/Penthouse_%28magazine%29.html" title="Penthouse (magazine)">Penthouse</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[26]</a></sup> The demands spread nationally and intimidated some retailers into withdrawing photography magazines, among others.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[27]</a></sup> The Meese Commission's campaign was eventually quashed with a <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Amendment_8cc4.html" title="First Amendment">First Amendment</a> admonishment against prior restraint by the D.C. Federal Court in Meese v. Playboy (639 F.Supp. 581).</p>
<p>In her testimony and replies to questions from the commissioners, Dworkin condemned the use of criminal obscenity prosecutions against pornographers, stating, "We are against obscenity laws. We don't want them. I want you to understand why, whether you end up agreeing or not" (285). She argued that obscenity laws were largely ineffectual (285), that when they were effectual they only suppressed pornography from public view while allowing it to flourish out of sight (285-286), and that they suppressed the wrong material, or the right material for the wrong reasons, arguing that "Obscenity laws are also woman-hating in their very construction. Their basic presumption is that it's women's bodies that are dirty" (286). Instead she offered five recommendations for the Commission, recommending (1) that "the Justice Department instruct law-enforcement agencies to keep records of the use of pornography in violent crimes" (286), (2) a ban on the possession and distribution of pornography in prisons (287), (3) that prosecutors "enforce laws against pimping and pandering against pornographers" (287), (4) that the administration "make it a Justice Department priority to enforce RICO the <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act_1837.html" title="Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act">Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act</a> against the pornography industry" (287), and (5) that Congress adopt federal anti-pornography civil rights legislation which would provide for civil damages for harm inflicted to woman. She suggested that the Commission consider "creating a criminal conspiracy provision under the civil rights law, such that conspiring to deprive a person of their civil rights by coercing them into pornography is a crime, and that conspiring to traffic in pornography is conspiring to deprive women of our civil rights" (288). Dworkin compared her proposal to the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Poverty_Law_Center_e0cd.html" title="Southern Poverty Law Center">Southern Poverty Law Center</a>'s use of civil rights litigation against the <a href="../../../k/u/_/Ku_Klux_Klan_2a27.html" title="Ku Klux Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> (285).</p>
<p>Dworkin also submitted into evidence a copy of Boreman's book <i>Ordeal</i>, as an example of the abuses that she hoped to remedy, saying "The only thing atypical about Linda is that she has had the courage to make a public fight against what has happened to her. And whatever you come up with, it has to help her or it's not going to help anyone." Boreman had testified in person before the Commission, but the Commissioners had not yet seen her book (289).</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>, Dworkin published <i>Right-Wing Women: The Politics of Domesticated Females</i>, an examination of what she claimed were women's reasons for collaborating with men for the limitation of women's freedom.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[28]</a></sup> In the Preface to the British edition (reprinted in <i>Letters from a War Zone</i>, 185-194), Dworkin stated that the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Right_36d7.html" title="New Right">New Right</a> in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> focused especially on preserving male authority in the family, the promotion of <a href="../../../f/u/n/Fundamentalism.html" title="Fundamentalism">fundamentalist</a> versions of orthodox religion, combating abortion, and undermining efforts to combat domestic violence (192-193), but that it also had, for the first time, "succeeded in getting <i>women as women</i> (women who claim to be acting in the interests of women as a group) to act effectively in behalf of male authority over women, in behalf of a hierarchy in which women are subservient to men, in behalf of women as the rightful property of men, in behalf of religion as an expression of transcendent male supremacy" (193). Taking this as her problem, Dworkin asked, "Why do right-wing women agitate for their own subordination? How does the <a href="../../../r/i/g/Right-wing.html" title="Right-wing">Right</a>, controlled by men, enlist their participation and loyalty? And why do right-wing women truly hate the feminist struggle for equality?" (194).</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a> Dworkin published <i><a href="../../../i/n/t/Intercourse_%28book%29.html" title="Intercourse (book)">Intercourse</a></i>, in which she extended her analysis from pornography to <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_intercourse.html" title="Sexual intercourse">sexual intercourse</a> itself, and argued that the sort of sexual subordination depicted in pornography was central to men's and women's experiences of heterosexual intercourse in a male supremacist society.</p>
<p>Citing from both pornography and literature—including <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Kreutzer_Sonata_a8a3.html" title="The Kreutzer Sonata">The Kreutzer Sonata</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../m/a/d/Madame_Bovary_6938.html" title="Madame Bovary">Madame Bovary</a></i>, and <i><a href="../../../d/r/a/Dracula.html" title="Dracula">Dracula</a></i>—Dworkin argued that depictions of intercourse in mainstream art and culture consistently emphasized heterosexual intercourse as the only kind of "real" sex, portrayed intercourse in violent or invasive terms, portrayed the violence or invasiveness as central to its eroticism, and often united it with male contempt for, revulsion towards, or even murder of, the "carnal" woman. She argued that this kind of depiction enforced a male-centric and coercive view of sexuality, and that, when the cultural attitudes combine with the material conditions of women's lives in a <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexist.html" title="Sexist">sexist</a> society, the experience of heterosexual intercourse itself becomes a central part of men's subordination of women, experienced as a form of "occupation" that is nevertheless expected to be pleasurable for women and to define their very status <i>as women</i>.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p>Such descriptions are often cited by Dworkin's critics, interpreting (sometimes even falsely quoting) the book as claiming that "All heterosexual intercourse is rape," or more generally that the anatomical features of sexual intercourse make it intrinsically harmful to women's equality. Dworkin rejected that interpretation of her argument,<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[30]</a></sup> stating in a later interview<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[31]</a></sup>that "I think both intercourse and sexual pleasure can and will survive equality," and suggesting that the misunderstanding came about because of the very sexual ideology she was criticizing: "Since the paradigm for sex has been one of conquest, possession, and violation, I think many men believe they need an unfair advantage, which at its extreme would be called rape. I don't think they need it."<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[32]</a></sup> (For discussion of the controversy, see: <i><a href="../../../i/n/t/Intercourse_%28book%29.html" title="Intercourse (book)">Intercourse</a></i>)</p>

<p>In 1992, the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Court_of_Canada_1283.html" title="Supreme Court of Canada">Supreme Court of Canada</a> made a ruling in <a href="../../../r/2E/_/R._v._Butler_8538.html" title="R. v. Butler">R. v. Butler</a> (the "Butler decision") which incorporated some elements of Dworkin and MacKinnon's legal work on pornography into the existing Canadian obscenity law. In <i>Butler</i> the Court held that Canadian obscenity law violated Canadian citizens' rights to free speech under the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms_50c7.html" title="Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a> if enforced on grounds of morality or community standards of decency; but that obscenity law could be enforced constitutionally against some pornography on the basis of the Charter's guarantees of sex equality.

But I have used everything I know — my life — to show what I believe must be shown so that it can be faced.

<p>In <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_2000.html" title="June 2000">June 2000</a>, Dworkin published controversial articles in the <i>New Statesman</i><sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[44]</a></sup> and in the <i>Guardian</i><sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[45]</a></sup> , stating that one or more men had raped her in her hotel room in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> the previous year, putting <a href="../../../g/h/b/GHB_10bc.html" title="GHB">GHB</a> in her drink to disable her. Her articles ignited public controversy when writers such as Catherine Bennett<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[46]</a></sup> and Julia Gracen<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[47]</a></sup> published doubts about her account, polarizing opinion between skeptics and supporters such as <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catharine_MacKinnon_f828.html" title="Catharine MacKinnon">Catharine MacKinnon</a>, Katharine Viner,<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[48]</a></sup> and <a href="../../../g/l/o/Gloria_Steinem_5452.html" title="Gloria Steinem">Gloria Steinem</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, Dworkin published her autobiography, <i>Heartbreak: The Political Memoir of a Feminist Militant</i>. She soon began to speak and write again, and in interview with Julie Bindel in 2004<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[51]</a></sup> said, "I thought I was finished, but I feel a new vitality. I want to continue to help women." She published three more articles in the <i>Guardian</i> and began work on a new book, <i>Writing America: How Novelists Invented and Gendered a Nation</i>, on the role of novelists such as <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernest_Hemingway_f01d.html" title="Ernest Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Faulkner_788f.html" title="William Faulkner">William Faulkner</a> in the development of American political and cultural identity, which was left unfinished when she died.</p>

<p>During her final years Dworkin suffered from fragile health, and she revealed in her last column for the <i>Guardian</i><sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[52]</a></sup> that she had been weakened and nearly crippled for the past several years by severe <a href="../../../o/s/t/Osteoarthritis.html" title="Osteoarthritis">osteoarthritis</a> in the knees.

<p>Dworkin authored ten books of radical feminist theory and numerous speeches and articles, each designed to assert the presence of and denounce institutionalized and normalized harm against women. She became one of the most influential writers and spokeswomen of <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radical_feminism.html" title="Radical feminism">radical feminism</a> during the late <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a> and the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>. She characterized pornography as an industry of damaging objectification and abuse, not merely a <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantasy_%28psychology%29.html" title="Fantasy (psychology)">fantasy</a> realm. She discussed prostitution as a system of exploitation, and intercourse as a key site of subordination in <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriarchy.html" title="Patriarchy">patriarchy</a>. Her analysis and writing influenced and inspired the work of her contemporary feminists, such as <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catharine_MacKinnon_f828.html" title="Catharine MacKinnon">Catharine MacKinnon</a>, <a href="../../../g/l/o/Gloria_Steinem_5452.html" title="Gloria Steinem">Gloria Steinem</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Stoltenberg_846b.html" title="John Stoltenberg">John Stoltenberg</a>, <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikki_Craft_af1b.html" title="Nikki Craft">Nikki Craft</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susan_Cole_d1c0.html" title="Susan Cole">Susan Cole</a>, and Amy Elman.</p>
<p>Dworkin's uncompromising positions and strident style of writing and speaking, described by Robert Campbell as "apocalyptic",<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[56]</a></sup> earned her frequent comparisons to <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malcolm_X_92fd.html" title="Malcolm X">Malcolm X</a> (by <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Morgan_d74a.html" title="Robin Morgan">Robin Morgan</a>,<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[57]</a></sup> <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susie_Bright_d03e.html" title="Susie Bright">Susie Bright</a>,<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[58]</a></sup> and others), and to the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Testament_79e6.html" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a> prophets (by <a href="../../../g/l/o/Gloria_Steinem_5452.html" title="Gloria Steinem">Gloria Steinem</a>). Her attitude and language often sharply polarized debate, and made Dworkin herself a figure of intense controversy. After her death, the conservative gay writer <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Sullivan_6a55.html" title="Andrew Sullivan">Andrew Sullivan</a> claimed that "[M]any on the social right liked Andrea Dworkin. Like Dworkin, their essential impulse when they see human beings living freely is to try and control or stop them — for their own good. Like Dworkin, they are horrified by male sexuality, and see men as such as a problem to be tamed. Like Dworkin, they believe in the power of the state to censor and coerce sexual freedoms. Like Dworkin, they view the enormous new freedom that women and gay people have acquired since the 1960s as a terrible development for human culture."<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[59]</a></sup> <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cathy_Young_3b1b.html" title="Cathy Young">Cathy Young</a> complained of a "whitewash" in feminist obituaries for Dworkin, argued that Dworkin's positions were manifestly <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misandry.html" title="Misandry">misandrist</a>, and stated that Dworkin was in fact <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insane.html" title="Insane">insane</a>.<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[60]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[61]</a></sup> Other feminists, however, published sympathetic or celebratory memorials online and in print.<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[62]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[63]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[64]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[65]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[66]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#_note-66" title="">[67]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[68]</a></sup> <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catharine_MacKinnon_f828.html" title="Catharine MacKinnon">Catharine MacKinnon</a>, Dworkin's longtime friend and collaborator, published a column in the <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a></i>, celebrating what she described as Dworkin's "incandescent literary and political career," suggested that Dworkin deserved a nomination for the <a href="../../../n/o/b/Nobel_Prize_in_Literature_c0fb.html" title="Nobel Prize in Literature">Nobel Prize in Literature</a>, and complained that "Lies about her views on sexuality (that she believed intercourse was rape) and her political alliances (that she was in bed with the right) were published and republished without attempts at verification, corrective letters almost always refused.

<p>Dworkin's reports of violence suffered at the hands of men sometimes aroused skepticism, the most famous example being the public controversy over her allegations of being drugged and raped in Paris. In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>, Dworkin wrote an article about her life as a battered wife in the Netherlands, "What Battery Really Is", in response to fellow radical feminist <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susan_Brownmiller_c6cb.html" title="Susan Brownmiller">Susan Brownmiller</a>, who had argued that <a href="../../../h/e/d/Hedda_Nussbaum_9642.html" title="Hedda Nussbaum">Hedda Nussbaum</a>, a battered woman, should have been indicted for her failure to stop <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joel_Steinberg_bc4f.html" title="Joel Steinberg">Joel Steinberg</a> from murdering their adoptive daughter. <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/Newsweek.html" title="Newsweek">Newsweek</a></i> initially accepted "What Battery Really Is" for publication, but then declined to publish the account at the request of their attorney, arguing that Dworkin needed to publish anonymously "to protect the identity of the batterer" and remove any references to specific injuries, or else to provide "medical records, police records, a written statement from a doctor who had seen the injuries." Dworkin submitted the article to the <i><a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Times_ea99.html" title="Los Angeles Times">Los Angeles Times</a></i>, which published it on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_12.html" title="March 12">March 12</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>.<sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[70]</a></sup></p>
<p>Some critics, such as <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Flynt_1649.html" title="Larry Flynt">Larry Flynt</a>'s magazine <i><a href="../../../h/u/s/Hustler_%28magazine%29.html" title="Hustler (magazine)">Hustler</a></i> and Gene Healy,<sup id="_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#_note-70" title="">[71]</a></sup> allege that Dworkin endorsed <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incest.html" title="Incest">incest</a>. In the closing chapter of <i>Woman Hating</i> (1974), Dworkin wrote that "The parent-child relationship is primarily erotic because all human relationships are primarily erotic," and that "The incest taboo, because it denies us essential fulfillment with the parents whom we love with our primary energy, forces us to internalize those parents and constantly seek them. The incest taboo does the worst work of the culture [...] The destruction of the incest taboo is essential to the development of cooperative human community based on the free-flow of natural androgynous eroticism" (Dworkin 1974, p.189). Dworkin, however, does not explain if "fulfillment" is supposed to involve actual sexual intimacy, and one page earlier characterized what she meant by "erotic relationships" as relationships whose "substance is nonverbal communication and touch" (188), which she explicitly distinguished from what she referred to as "fucking" (187).</p>
<p>Dworkin's work from the early <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> onward contained frequent condemnations of incest and <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia.html" title="Pedophilia">pedophilia</a> as one of the chief forms of violence against women, arguing that "Incest is terrifically important in understanding the condition of women. It is a crime committed against someone, a crime from which many victims never recover."<sup id="_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#_note-71" title="">[72]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#_note-72" title="">[73]</a></sup> In the early 1980s she had a public row with her former friend <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allen_Ginsberg_6113.html" title="Allen Ginsberg">Allen Ginsberg</a> over his support for <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_pornography.html" title="Child pornography">child pornography</a> and pedophilia, in which Ginsberg said "The right wants to put me in jail," and Dworkin responded "Yes, they're very sentimental; I'd kill you."<sup id="_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#_note-73" title="">[74]</a></sup> When <i>Hustler</i> published the claim that Dworkin advocated incest in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>, Dworkin sued them for defamatory libel; the court dismissed Dworkin's complaint on the grounds that whether the allegations were true or false, a faulty interpretation of a work placed into the "<a href="../../../m/a/r/Marketplace_of_ideas.html" title="Marketplace of ideas">marketplace of ideas</a>" did not amount to <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defamation.html" title="Defamation">defamation</a> in the legal sense.<sup id="_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#_note-74" title="">[75]</a></sup></p>
<p>Other critics, especially women who identify as feminists but sharply differ with Dworkin's style or positions, have offered nuanced views, suggesting that Dworkin called attention to real and important problems, but that her legacy as a whole had been destructive to the women's movement.<sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#_note-75" title="">[76]</a></sup> Her work and activism on pornography—especially in the form of the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antipornography_civil_rights_ordinance.html" title="Antipornography civil rights ordinance">antipornography civil rights ordinance</a>—drew heavy criticism from groups such as the Feminist Anti-Censorship Task Force (FACT). Dworkin also became a lightning-rod for criticism from self-described "<a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex-positive_feminism.html" title="Sex-positive feminism">sex-positive feminists</a>," who emerged largely in opposition to the feminist <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-pornography_movement.html" title="Anti-pornography movement">anti-pornography movement</a> during the 1980s, as Dworkin was becoming prominent on the national stage. "Sex-positive feminist" critics criticized her legal activism as censorious, and argued that her work on pornography and sexuality promoted an essentialist, conservative, or repressive view of sexuality, which they often characterized as "anti-sex" or "sex-negative." Her criticisms of common heterosexual sexual expression, pornography, prostitution, and sexual <a href="../../../s/a/d/Sadism_and_Masochism_521d.html" title="Sadism and Masochism">sadism</a> were frequently claimed to disregard women's own agency in sex or to deny women's sexual choices. Dworkin countered that her critics often misrepresented her views,<sup id="_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#_note-76" title="">[77]</a></sup> and that under the heading of "choice" and "sex-positivity" her feminist critics were failing to question the often violent political structures that confined women's choices and shaped the meaning of sex acts.<sup id="_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#_note-77" title="">[78]</a></sup></p>

<li id="_note-76"><b><a href="#_ref-76" title="">^</a></b> See, for example, <i>Letters from a War Zone</i>, p. 110: "One of the slurs constantly used against me by women writing in behalf of pornography under the flag of feminism in misogynist media is that I endorse a primitive biological determinism. <i>Woman Hating</i> (1974) clearly repudiates any biological determinism; so does <i>Our Blood</i> (1976), especially 'The Root Cause.' So does this piece, published twice, in 1978 in <i>Heresies</i> and in 1979 in <i>Broadsheet</i>. The event described in this piece, which occurred in 1977 [a conflict at a panel on lesbian feminism between Dworkin and an essentialist sub-group of lesbian separatists], was fairly notorious, and so my position on biological determinism--I am against it--is generally known in the Women's Movement. One problem is that this essay, like others in this book, has no cultural presence: no one has to know about it or take it into account to appear less than ignorant; no one will be held accountable for ignoring it. Usually critics and political adversaries have to reckon with the published work of male writers whom they wish to malign. No such rules protect girls."</li>
