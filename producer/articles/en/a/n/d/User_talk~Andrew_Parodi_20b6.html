<p>Welcome to Wikipedia, Andrew. I wanted to ask you to try to make <i>big</i> edits altogether instead of <i>many small</i> ones, in order to keep the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eva_Per%C3%B3n&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eva_Per%C3%B3n&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">history</a> of the article compact. Otherwise it makes it difficult to check on your modifications.

<dd>Andrew, I hope you feel comfortable with my adding of the WPBiography infobox to the article. There was a template/note on the talk page requesting that an infobox be added. As an editor mentioned on the talk page, it may be time to take this article through the <a href="../../../g/a/_/WP%7EGA_8191.html" title="WP:GA">Good article process</a>. I know you're somewhat new, so for now perhaps just read through the <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_is_a_good_article__31af.html" title="Wikipedia:What is a good article?">criteria</a> and think about whether the article qualifies in general. And remember that we are very willing to help you in any way. Thanks for contributing your expertise to Wikipedia! --<a href="../../../f/s/o/User%7EFsotrain09_ca86.html" title="User:Fsotrain09">Fsotrain</a><sub><a href="../../../f/s/o/User_talk%7EFsotrain09_af29.html" title="User talk:Fsotrain09">09</a></sub> 23:02, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey there. Just so you know - if you suggest two pages be merged, and nothing gets done, you can do the merge yourself if need be. Plus, a relatively low-content article such as <a href="../../../a/_/b/Anais_Nin%7E_A_Biography_7132.html" title="Anais Nin: A Biography">Anais Nin: A Biography</a> doesn't need to be <i>deleted</i> in favor of the slightly-longer, properly-named <a href="../../../a/_/b/Ana%C3%AFs_Nin%7E_A_Biography_305b.html" title="Ana√Øs Nin: A Biography">Ana√Øs Nin: A Biography</a>; rather, it can be easily converted into what is called a <i>redirect</i>.</p>
<p>To convert page X into an automatic redirect to page Y, the content of page X must be replaced with the following text (which must not be preceded by anything): #redirect [[Y]].</p>
<p>No harm done; this is just so you know if you find yourself in this situation again (which you probably will).</p>
<p>Furthermore, pages that are wrongly-named can be <i>moved</i> to new names. This is a very simple procedure that is restricted to users who've been registered for more than a month, because it's a feature that vandals with throwaway accounts have severely abused in the past. Since you've got three weeks to go before being granted move-page privileges, you can make a post on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_moves_b0bd.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested moves">Wikipedia:Requested moves</a>. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonflySixtyseven_c6ee.html" title="User:DragonflySixtyseven">DS</a> 13:32, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I ran, almost accidentally, into the <a href="../../../e/v/a/Eva_Per%C3%B3n_5aad.html" title="Eva Per√≥n">Eva Per√≥n</a> article's talk page and found the transcripts of your e-mail excahnge with NC about Peronism. I'm no expert at all on the biographical details of Eva Per√≥n or Per√≥n, but deeply interested in the social and political singularities of Peronism. Mr. Chomsky falls into a very common mistake of leftwing intellectuals around the world (including a large number of the Argentinian ones): their inability of understanding a complex phenomenon as Peronism. In more general terms, it seems they are unable to understand something that, for simplicity's sake, I'll call "national-populism", and uncritically identify it with rightwing governments. It would be curious indeed that a supposed "rightwing" government had gained such a support from the left. The appearance of Peronism broke the Socialist and Comunist parties; many of their supporters changed sides, criticizing their former parties attitude of joining a rightwing alliance, the "Union Democr√°tica" (fostered and fueled by the then US ambassador, Spruille Braden), agains Per√≥n in 1946 elections.</p>
<p>Let me point out that those curious conservative-communist alliances against the national-populism were very common in Latin America in the 40's and 50's. Gabriel Gonz√°lez Videla (who ended his days as and advisor to Pinochet's regime) became President of Chile with the support of the Chilean Communist Party. Same for Fulgencio Batista in Cuba. Other national-populist leaders in Latin America were less successful than Peron: Jorge Eliecer Gait√°n was assassinated in Colombia; Eduardo Chib√°s (Cuban) commited suicide after losing the 1952 elections; Jacobo Arbenz (Guatemalan) was thrown by a bloody US-backed coup in 1954, etc. In some sense, current Venezuelan leader Ch√°vez could be included into a similar "np" ideology.</p>
<p>Just scattered thoughts&#160;:) Thanks for your contributions, and if you want to go on ith the talk, do not hesitate in contacting me. <a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECinabrium_5144.html" title="User:Cinabrium">Cinabrium</a> 18:37, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, my name is Silvano. I wrote the article about the little village of Parodi Ligure, which you were interested in. At the moment I don't have any more information about the village, you know, it is very small (less than 800 inhabitants) and scattered. So, I can't promise anything but let me have a look at some of my books about local history and if I find something, I'll send you. Meanwhile, I suppose you know that "Parodi" is a very common surname near here, especially in the city of Genoa, where there's plenty of them. If you are interested in everything concerning Parodi, here it is a website where you can find information about Filippo Parodi, genoan sculptor in the XVIII century . <a href="http://www.wga.hu/html/p/parodi/" class="external free" title="http://www.wga.hu/html/p/parodi/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wga.hu/html/p/parodi/</a> (in english) And did you know? you can even find a pier in the ancient port of Genoa named "Parodi" <a href="http://www.ponteparodi.com" class="external free" title="http://www.ponteparodi.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ponteparodi.com</a> (sorry only italian it seems, have your traslator at hand)</p>
<p>Bye Silvano a.k.a. Silvo from Wikipedia Italy</p>
<p>P.S. I suppose your translator is very useful to understand from a foreign language but if you use it the other way round it looks quite weird to an italian eye...</p>

<p>Hi, Andrew. I noticed you left a comment for the Roomba bot about your image getting tagged for deletion. As Roomba is merely a bot operated by <a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">User:Gmaxwell</a>, I'll take the liberty of responding.&#160;:-) We don't allow users to have images not under a free license (such as the GFDL or certain CC licenses) on user pages. If you would like to keep your picture from getting tagged, you can relicense it under a free license according to the <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_use_policy_10e2.html" title="Wikipedia:Image use policy">Wikipedia:Image use policy</a>. This does not mean that you give up the copyright to it. (In fact, in many jurisdictions, you *can't* give up the copyright to it.) It does mean that you would allow it to be redistributed freely under the terms of the GFDL or the allowable CC licenses, as with the other free image content on Wikipedia. (In practice, very few people ever want to reuse personal photos of Wikipedians, lovely bunch as we may be! Particularly not if you license as GFDL -- the terms of this license are somewhat unwieldy for image licensing, though someone determined to have that particular picture may still wish to use it.) See <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyrights_92c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyrights">Wikipedia:Copyrights</a> fpor more information. If this is not acceptable to you, let me know or tag the image with {{<a href="../../../d/e/l/Template%7EDelete_bfa0.html" title="Template:Delete">delete</a>}} and someone will come by and delete it for you.</p>
<p>Since we do delete images used under fair use that are not being used in article space, the Roomba bot goes and tags these images so that admins may more easily find them to delete them; it will continue doing so every time it is run as long as the image has a fair use tag and is not being used in article space, as this is done automatically. Hope this helps; ask me or <a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">User:Gmaxwell</a> (who runs the bot) if you have any questions.

<dd>Hm. All of the licenses that Wikipedia allows require that you allow derivative works‚Äîwhich, I note, include putting a mustache on your picture.

<p>About your question in the Spanish's article talk page:</p>
<p>Spanish:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Delia Parodi fu√© una pol√≠tica argentina que trabaj√≥ con Eva Per√≥n en el Partido Peronista Feminino, y fu√© elegida diputada nacional por ese partido, siendo una de las primeras mujeres en ingresar en el congreso.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Delia Parodi fue electa en 1951 por el peronismo de la Capital Federal. El 25 de abril de 1953 fue designada Vicepresidenta 1¬∞ de la c√°mara de diputados, cargo que por primera vez se le asignaba a una mujer. Ocup√≥ su cargo hasta 1955, momento en que fue apresada durante la Revoluci√≥n Libertadora, siendo liberada el 7 de marzo de 1958.</dd>
</dl>
<p>English translation:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Delia Parodi was a female politician who worked with Eva Peron in the Peronist Women's Party, and she was elected national deputy of the party, becoming one of the first women to be a member of congress.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>In 1951, Delia Parodi was elected as the peronist representative in Argentina's capital city of Buenos Aires. On April 25, 1953, she was designated the Vice President of the Chamber of Deputies, the first time this office had been occupied by a woman. She maintained this role until 1955 when Juan Peron was overthrown in a military coup.</i></dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My english is bad so I am not able to fix that paragraph, so I will explain the points and you will be able to fix it yourself.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Delia Parodi fue electa en 1951 por el peronismo de la Capital Federal: This means that she was elected in 1971 as one of the many representatives of the peronist party in the Chamber of Deputies but representing the Buenos Aires's (Capital Federal) branch of the party. In argentina each province (state) has an amount of representatives to send to the Chamber of Deputies. Buenos Aires is not a state, but it is considered an state for the election of representtives.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Chamber of Deputies authorities are:
<ul>
<li>Presidente (President)</li>
<li>Vicepresidente 1¬∫ (First Vice President)</li>
<li>Vicepresidente 2¬∫ (Second Vice President)</li>
<li>Vicepresidente 3¬∫ (Third Vice President)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The was <i>Vicepresidente 1¬∫</i>, which I thing it could be translated to English as "First Vice President" (attention: not THE first Vice President).</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure if there was a "Peronist Women's Party" or it wast just an internal branch of the "Peronist party".</li>
</ul>
<p><i>But I'm not sure what the last sentence means: "siendo liberada el 7 de marzo de 1958." Can someone translate this for me? I want to edit the English page according to this page. Thanks. Andrew Parodi 06:42 4 abr 2006 (CEST)</i></p>
<p><i>fue apresada</i>&#160;: she went to jail (when the military coup took place) <i>siendo liberada</i>: being freed (from prison) on March 7th 1958. So she stayed from 1955 to 1958 in prison.</p>

<p>I just wanted to let you know that I've been keeping an eye on your progress on the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colegio_Cesar_Chavez_5953.html" title="Colegio Cesar Chavez">Colegio Cesar Chavez</a> article. It has come a long way since I first encountered it, and the pictures are very illustrative. Any idea who the poet at the reading is? Anyone of note?</p>
<p>I suppose your interest in the college is rooted more in geography than in alternative education or ethnic history, but I thought I'd ask if you have ever heard of Deganawida Queztalcoatl University, the Native American/Chicano institute of alternative higher education? I believe it had some affiliation with UC Davis in the 1970s. It may be something to look into...</p>

<dd>I asked about the poet because I thought it might have been Alurista, but I suppose that is unlikely considering the geographic discrepancy. I put a Daniel Desiga poster at the top of the article because it was more colorful than the course catalogue, and I thought it represented the college well (trees for OR, grapes and the huelga eagle for Chicanismo). If you disagree, feel free to move it elsewhere or discuss. Hope you like it, --<a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockero_6950.html" title="User:Rockero">Rockero</a> 02:18, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You may have some unique prespectives on issues which the rest of us barely know about and if so it'd be helpful if you could add them. Our aim isn't to fatten the indictment against an editor, but simply to make sure that the Wikipedia project isn't disrupted further.

<p>I'd like to help with the ACIM article, but I just don't want to get involved anymore. In my opinion, Ste4k created the ugliest scene I've ever seen on Wikipedia, and now that ACIM page looks like a complete battle ground. It's just too frustrating. Life has been good without the headache of trying to improve that article. I'm sorry, but I have to wash my hands of it. I hope the rest of you are able to do something that apparently I wasn't able to do: create a good ACIM page without getting caught in a bizarre battle. To be honest, I'm shell shocked from my experience with Ste4k and as a result just can't bring myself to contribute to any page anymore. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 21:08, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Come now! Are you going to let big b4d Ste4k dictate your actions? Call <a href="../../../a/c/i/ACIM_4158.html" title="ACIM">ACIM</a> not a battleground but a "product of evolutionary pressure." ^_^ With your important input and oversight, we can make it sparkle even brighter. The article hit a crunch period (namely, collision with Big Brother policy), and it has to adapt as a result. But adapt, not die. So let's get working on it! Sometimes people get each other wrong, undervalue each other's contributions, probably call each other names, probably want to kill each other, maybe actually try... but that's life, so we just shake it off, right?

<dd>I'll respect your wish, then. Having more pressing matters is understandable. It would be a shame though if ever you wanted to participate but refrained for fear that you would not have a respected voice, or that you would not be able to show patience to the editors who desire so badly to fit in that they argue and disrupt. For who do they call upon for patience and understanding to show them they don't have to do any of this just to get along, to be welcome, to have a place, a voice? And who could be benefited by separation instead?

<p>Thanks for uploading Image:Passportmichaelparodi.jpg. Wikipedia gets thousands of images uploaded every day, and in order to verify that the images can be legally used on Wikipedia, the source and copyright status must be indicated. Images need to have an <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">image tag</a> applied to the <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_description_page_4215.html" title="Wikipedia:Image description page">image description page</a> indicating the copyright status of the image.

<dd>Hi. Thanks for the response. I wasn't aware of any wikipedia guidelines on who fills in stubs. I have filled in quite a few and started a number that I have yet to get back to. I am somewhat of a newcomer, and I have not spent an awful lot of time cruising around all the wiki help files. They are, indeed, helpful--but also time-consuming and confusing, at least to me. I'll probably put some more stuff in that article when I get inspired. Where are your Italian ancestors from. If from down here in Naples or nearby, you muight like a page I keep at <a href="http://faculty.ed.umuc.edu/~jmatthew/naples/index.html" class="external free" title="http://faculty.ed.umuc.edu/~jmatthew/naples/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://faculty.ed.umuc.edu/~jmatthew/naples/index.html</a> My labor of love. I steal from myself and give to Wikipedia sometimes. (Note an article near the top of the list about emigration museums around Italy. They are just gearing up. About time.) Cheers. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffmatt_a810.html" title="User:Jeffmatt">Jeffmatt</a> 06:27, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Indeed, this interment stuff is all very intesting. It is, of course, totally overshadowed ny the infamous internment of Japanese-Americans. I think we have to be careful with sources, however. You want verifiable information on, first of all, the existence of "camps". If they existed for Italians, then they should have existed for Germans. To be honest, I have my doubts--but, of course, I remain open-minded on the issue. There is a difference between interning a "returned" Italian-American such as your grandfather and interning, say, all second and third generation Americans of Italian descent--or German descent, for that matter--which is what happened to the Japanese in California. (Interesting, under Japanese Imperial law, what we call "second generation" Japanese--Nisei--were still Japanese subjects. Similarly, Germany considered anyone born in Germany a German citizen, no matter whether or not they had become naturalized in another country. I suspect--but don't know--that Fascist Italy had a similar provision. It would be interesting to find out. In any event, if all Americans of Italian and German descent had been subjected to the same treatment we gave the Japanese, New York and New Jersey would have wound totally depopulated!</dd>

<dd>If you pay 14 bucks year to the New York Times, you can get their NYT Select service, which gives you access to their archives back to 1851. Some of the material I used in the Diaspora article I got from that source. Amazing stuff. You can type in--as I did--"Italian immigration" and get hundreds of hits, written at the time you choose. Amazing stuff. I'll give it a try with "Italian internment" and let you know. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffmatt_a810.html" title="User:Jeffmatt">Jeffmatt</a> 13:34, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm back. Thanks for turning me on to that Storia Segreta site. It looks well-documented. I am taking back (!) a very large portion of my doubt expressed in the above paragraph.

<dd>I have been collecting some stuff on internemt. You were right on. I am reluctant take up all your talk page with it, though. If you go to that webpage of mine and send me an email, I'll answer with a list of the references and info I have, and which I will happy to send you. I am glad you mentioned all that to me; it is an article that should be written. If you haven't got the time, I can take a crack at it, but not immediately. I am very busy at the moment. I hate how real life intereferes with things I really enjoy doing. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffmatt_a810.html" title="User:Jeffmatt">Jeffmatt</a> 09:27, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi there...</p>
<p>In reviewing for orphaned imags, I came across a number of public domain images you had uploaded for use in various sub-pages from your user page. I wanted to make you aware that while the criteria for information on a user page (and also the subpages) is much less strict then in any article, there are guidelines that limit the use. Please see <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSER_5ae6.html" title="WP:USER">WP:USER</a> for information. I believe that the pages, especially the one regarding your father, are candidates for deletion under the userpage guidelines. It seems that you use your pages as webhosting and personal webspace; these uses are not allowed. I would like to give you an opportunity to review the guideline, and take any appropriate action. But please be aware that after a couple of weeks, especially if you are an active editor, I will be nominating the pages for community comment and decision. It seems you have spent a lot of time on these pages and they are personal to you. The following are the pages I am speaking about:</p>
<ul>
<li>User:Andrew_Parodi/ohfather</li>
<li>User:Andrew_Parodi/chemawapowwow092906</li>
<li>User:Andrew Parodi/LEC pictures</li>

<p>If you have questions, I am will to discuss. Please leave me a note on my talk page.

<dd>I can appreciate not wanting to have these pages discussed in a public forum. That concern was the very reason I brought this to you in place of simply nominating. I am not an admin so I am unable to delete them myself. I would suggest you relocate the pages to some other venue, there are lots of free webspace sites out there (Geocities is the only one I have ever had much interaction with). Once the information is transfered, I would suggest you contact someone who is an admin who you know and trust here. Advise him/her of the issue and how you would like it to be handled. I would suggest that the admin delete the subpages and also the personal, non-encyclopedic images used on those pages. It would definately help the admin if you pulled all that information into one place. If there is anything else, please let me know.--<a href="../../../g/a/y/User%7EGay_Cdn_0b6b.html" title="User:Gay Cdn">Gay Cdn</a> <small><a href="../../../g/a/y/User_talk%7EGay_Cdn_e245.html" title="User talk:Gay Cdn">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Gay_Cdn_2058.html" title="Special:Contributions/Gay Cdn">(Contr.)</a></small> 00:33, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello 'Andrew Parodi'. Putting most of ones efforts into a single article, can be frustrating at times (as you've found out), because there are millions of editors out there (mostly anon-users). Anything submitted to an article, stands a good chance of being reverted or vandalized. The only way to stop revertings or vandalism, would be an article block (however in that case most articles would have to be blocked). I guess what I'm trying to say is, in an free &amp; open encylopedia, all edits added to an article (no matter how accurate) are open season (for reverting or vandalism). Not sure how to end the Photo debates, however the 'Lisa Simpson' photo, subtracts from the article. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodDay_3ee1.html" title="User:GoodDay">GoodDay</a> 19:51, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm sorry for my late reply and to read you have decided to retire from the Evita article. As for the pictures issue, I think that, it does have too many fair use images and I think that was the main concern. You've done a great job with the article, and I know it may be a frustrating job most of the times, but it's editors like you what keep Wikipedia running. If you decide to return as an editor of the article, you can request a <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_9d17.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal">Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal</a>. It's an informal way of mediation and I'll be glad to be your mediator if you decide to go for it. I was planning to help you take the article to FA status, so it's sad to see you go.

<dd>Andrew, I'd like to second Nat91's comments, although I even think you've got a good case with the fair use rationale. Bottom line though, you have done amazing work here, valuable work, and it really would be a shame to lose your expertise on this subject, and the guidance you offer to the article's editors because of it. I know how difficult it is to have these content/material disputes devolve into personal conflicts, I do, but like Nat91, I really hope you reconsider. -<a href="../../../f/s/o/User%7EFsotrain09_ca86.html" title="User:Fsotrain09">Fsotrain</a><sup><a href="../../../f/s/o/User_talk%7EFsotrain09_af29.html" title="User talk:Fsotrain09">09</a></sup> 05:17, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>I'm glad to know you decided to return to the Eva Peron article. I'm currently on a wikibreak because of the holidays. I'm willing to start helping, but I may not respond quickly to messages until January. In order to get the article ready for FAC, you need to be opened to copy-edits and further suggestions. I've been thinking about what needs to be done and the first thing is the images. After taking a look at them again, we may have to get rid of Image:Eva juan.jpg and Image:Argevita2pr.jpg (the image is not well tagged and I'm not sure if fair use qualifies for Wikipedia). All the public domain images, plus 2 magazine covers and a book cover will be fine, in my opinion. We'll also need to reach an agreement with user Peron. A copy edit is the next step, I know users who may be able to help.</p>
