My name is Ryan, aka <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAcetic_Acid_31d1.html" title="User:Acetic Acid">Acetic Acid</a>. I noticed that you were new and haven't received any messages yet. I just wanted to see how you were doing. Wikipedia can be a little intimidating at first, since it uses different formatting than other sites that use <a href="../../../h/t/m/HTML_4c4a.html" title="HTML">HTML</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cascading_Style_Sheets_981c.html" title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</a>. In the long run, though, you'll find that the WikiSyntax is a lot easier and faster than those other ways. Here are a few links to get you started:</p>

<p>There are a lot of policies and guides to read, but I highly recommend reading over those first. If you have any questions, feel free to leave me a message on my <a href="../../../a/c/e/User_talk%7EAcetic_Acid_8f87.html" title="User talk:Acetic Acid">talk page</a>. Please be sure to <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">sign your name on Talk Pages</a> using four tildes (~~~~) to produce your name and the current date, along with a link to your user page. This way, others know when you left a message and how to find you. It's easier than having to type out your name, right?&#160;:)</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy contributing to Wikipedia. We can use all the help we can get! Have a nice day.

<p>Andrew,</p>
<p>I added the bit about the Maze procedure to the atrial fibrillation page. Both capitalizations have been used. Cox, who developed the procedure, prefers Maze in his recent publications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cox JL. <a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=521766" class="external text" title="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=521766" rel="nofollow">The Role of Surgical Intervention in the Management of Atrial Fibrillation.</a> Tex Heart Inst J. 2004; 31(3): 257–265. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=15562846" class="external" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=15562846">PMID 15562846</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I think that he actually intends it to be a proper noun, like "Kleenex", to distinguish it from other (lesser) "Maze-like" procedures. I'd rather not go around and around on this, but I'd prefer the Maze capitalization so that it is internally consistent, in agreement with Cox, and consistent with the other wikipedia subject that I wrote, <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minimaze.html" title="Minimaze">minimaze</a>. There I have been very careful to use what I believe to be the proper capitalizations.</p>
<p>So I intend to change the capitalizations back to Maze where appropriate unless you plan to change them back again to maze.</p>

<p>Hi: My name is Tess and I work for a global independent research firm in New York. I am interested in hiring you for a Wikipedia editing project, based on your technology and medical experience and expertise. I attempted to email you through your user page. If you received it, please read it over and contact me with any questions. If you did not receive this email, please let me know and I would be more than happy to tell you more about this project. (You can call 512-651-1797 or email tfurman@glgroup.com).

<dd>Good point.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I dewikified aspirate in this article as it's redirecting to aspiration (phonetics) which seems completely irrelevant. There's also aspiration (medicine) but that doesn't seem to fit with what the article says either (could be wrong - I'm not a medic). If not, could you mention what an aspirate is in the article? Thanks, <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECantthinkofagoodname_4422.html" title="User:Cantthinkofagoodname">CTOAGN</a> 23:23, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Embarrassingly, I didn't see your prior edit! I created a disambiguation page for <a href="../../../a/s/p/Aspirate.html" title="Aspirate">aspirate</a> and removed the redirect to <a href="../../../a/s/p/Aspiration_%28phonetics%29.html" title="Aspiration (phonetics)">aspiration (phonetics)</a>. I now wikified aspirate to the page describing <a href="../../../n/e/e/Needle_aspiration_biopsy.html" title="Needle aspiration biopsy">needle aspiration biopsy</a> 00:43, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Interestingly, if you go to the ISI Web of Knowledge, Journal Citation Reports, where the impact factors are calculated and the journals are ranked, the category is "medicine, general &amp; internal," so general medical and internal medicine journals are actually lumped together!

<p>I'm curious if you are aware of any historical accounts on the recognition of PE as a clinical entity. The article now mentions some classical papers, but not when the signs and symptoms (and etiology) of VTE/PE were first recognised.</p>

<p>Makes sense...I don't have any problem with your removal.

<p>Happy to hear you like the converter.&#160;:-) Actually, the converter isn't adding the period; it's just that Template:Journal reference issue always adds a period to titles and in your case the title has already got a period of its own (see <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=1900101" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=1900101" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>). I've tweaked the converter so it removes trailing periods in titles, but this won't solve the larger issue of using Template:Journal reference issue et al to reference articles whose titles have trailing punctuation. For example, "Long-term potentiation--A decade of progress?" <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=10489359&amp;query_hl=6" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=10489359&amp;query_hl=6" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> would still render pretty oddly. To solve this the right way would require lots of updates to existing wiki articles using it, but Template:Journal reference issue should probably let the user provide their own trailing punctuation in journal article titles. --<a href="../../../d/i/b/User%7EDiberri_3d04.html" title="User:Diberri">David Iberri</a> | <a href="../../../d/i/b/User_talk%7EDiberri_54fd.html" title="User talk:Diberri">Talk</a> 16:01, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why did you restore a comment that was deleted because it was invalid? The introduction of MMR in 1988 was planned and known about before 1988. The comment added is therefore incorrect and disruptive. It is not an assertion that events in 1988 caused events in 1987. As a BMA member User Midgeley knows that is the case.</p>

<p>I think the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-vaccinationists.html" title="Anti-vaccinationists">anti-vaccinationists</a> article has the potential to be both interesting and good, if it is not disrupted. The scatter of failed biogrpahies of people whose only noticeable trait is to have been against vaccination doesn't help anything, and I wonder if we can do an effort to roll the whole damn lot up into paragprahs in the one article, unless any of them actually did interesti ng things as well. mendelsohn might make it I think, none of the others.</p>
<p>I think it would be tedious if all the medical biographies got a line "he was in favour of vaccination and called people who were not idiots" - it would do for Osler... but it would not be encyclopedic there, and therefore its obverse is not encyclopedic in a (non-)biography.</p>

<p>You deleted this (<a href="http://www.InfluenzaReport.com" class="external text" title="http://www.InfluenzaReport.com" rel="nofollow">Influenza Report 2006</a>) from the external links section of <a href="../../../i/n/f/Influenza.html" title="Influenza">Influenza</a>. I put it back. It is an online book with research level quality information and I highly recommend it.</p>
<p>Here is a sample:</p>
<dl>
<dd>In order to gain infectivity, influenza A virions must incorporate HA proteins which have been endoproteolytically processed from a HA0 precursor to a disulphide-linked HA1,2 dimer (Chen 1998). The newly created N-terminus of the HA2 subunit harbours a fusogenic peptide, composed of a highly lipophilic domain (Skehel 2001). This domain is vitally required during the fusion process of viral and lysosomal membranes because it initiates the penetration process of viral genomic segments into the host cell cytoplasm. The cleavage site of the HA of low pathogenic viruses is composed of two basic amino acids at positions -1/-4 (H5) and -1/-3 (H7) (Wood 1993). These sites are accessible to tissue-speciﬁc trypsin-like proteases which are preferentially expressed at the surface of respiratory and gastrointestinal epithelia. Therefore, efﬁcient replication of LPAIVs is believed to be largely confined to these sites, at least in their natural hosts. In contrast, the cleavage site of HPAI viruses generally contains additional basic amino acids (arginine and/or lysine) which renders it processible for subtilysin-like endoproteases speciﬁc for a minimal consensus sequence of -R-X-K/R-R- (Horimoto 1994, Rott 1995). Proteases of this type (e.g. furin, proprotein-convertases) are active in virtually every tissue throughout the body. Therefore, viruses carrying these mutations have an advantage for replicating unrestrictedly in a systemic manner. This process has been documented in the field on several occasions. In Italy, for example, an LPAI H7N1 virus circulated for several months in the turkey and chicken population before, in December 1999, an HPAI H7N1 virus, distinguishable from its precursor only by its polybasic cleavage site, sprang up and caused devastating disease (Capua 2000).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It has been hypothesised that the HA gene of the H5 and H7 subtypes harbour distinct secondary RNA structures which favour insertional mutations (codon duplications) by a re-copying mechanism of the viral polymerase unit at a purine-rich sequence stretch encoding the endoproteolytic cleavage site of these HA proteins (Garcia 1996, Perdue 1997). This, and probably other mechanisms too, such as nucleotide substitutions or intersegmental recombination (Suarez 2004, Pasick 2005), may lead to the incorporation of additional basic amino acid residues. The latter has been experimentally proven by the generation of HPAIV from LPAIV precursors following repeated passaging in vitro and in vivo by site-directed mutagenesis (Li 1990, Walker and Kawaoka 1993, Horimoto and Kawaoka 1995, Ito 2001). Conversely, removal by reverse genetics of the polybasic cleavage site attenuates the HPAI phenotype (Tian 2005).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There are, however, viral strains in which the nucleotide sequence encoding the HA cleavage site and the pheno-/pathotype did not match in the predicted way: a Chilean H7N3 HPAIV which arose by intersegmental recombination displayed basic amino acid residues only at positions -1, -4 and -6 (Suarez 2004). Comparable examples exist for the H5 lineage (Kawaoka 1984). On the other hand, an H5N2 isolate from Texas was shown to harbour the HPAIV cleavage site consensus sequence, yet was clinically classiﬁed as LPAI (Lee 2005). These data re-emphasise the polygenic and intricate nature of influenza virus pathogenicity.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Fortunately, nascency of HPAI phenotypes in the field appears to be a rare event. During the last ﬁfty years, only 24 primary HPAI outbreaks caused by HPAIV, which likely arose de novo in this way in the field, have been reported world-wide (Table 1).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In addition, HPAIV have been shown to be able to infect mammals, and humans in particular. This has especially been observed for the Asian lineage H5N1 (WHO 2006). Host-dependent pathogenicity of HPAIV H5N1 for mammals has been studied in several model species: mice (Lu 1999, Li 2005a), ferrets (Zitzow 2002, Govorkova 2005), cynomolgous monkeys (Rimmelzwaan 2001) and pigs (Choi 2005). The outcome of infection was dependent on the viral strain and species of host. Ferrets appeared to mirror pathogenicity in humans better than mice (Maines 2005).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>A number of genetic markers believed to be involved in pathogenicity have been located in different segments of the Z genotype of H5N1 (Table 2). Among these, mechanisms of interference with ﬁrst-line defence mechanisms of the host, such as the interferon system, through the NS-1 gene product have received marked interest. Experimentally, it has been demonstrated using reverse genetics, that NS-1 proteins of some H5N1 strains carrying glutamic acid at position 92 are capable of circumventing the antiviral effects of interferon and tumour necrosis factor-alpha, eventually leading to enhanced replication in, and reduced clearance from, the infected host (Seo 2002+2004). In addition, immune-mediated damage resulting from NS-1-mediated disruption of cytokine networks may account for parts of the lung lesions (Cheung 2002, Lipatov 2005). However, none of the mutations (Table 2) on its own represents a true prerequisite for pathogenicity in mammals (Lipatov 2003). Therefore, optimal gene constellations, to a large extent, appear to drive pathotype speciﬁcities in a host-dependent manner in mammals (Lipatov 2004).</dd>

<p>Andrew73, first of all, thanks for your expert help with the <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biological_psychiatry.html" title="Biological psychiatry">Biological psychiatry</a> article.

<p>I reverted your edit that removed trademarks. For one thing, registered trademarks must be noted under the U.S. law.</p>
<p>What's more important is that "Attenuvax®", <a href="../../../m/u/m/Mumpsvax.html" title="Mumpsvax">Mumpsvax</a>®, etc. are <i>products</i> that Merck sells.

<p>AUTOBIOGRAPHY</p>
<p><b>I was born at a very early age on a Brothel ship harboured off the coast of Taiwan. After a childhood of being convinced I was actually a horse I started working in the stables of the Japanese royal household. Accused of bestiality, I secretly left Japan to go to Bankgkok where I worked as a stand up comedian telling jokes about the Japanese Emperor's hygiene habits. After spending some time as a lady boy, I decided to have a sex change operation. Unable to find dresses that suited me I reversed the operation two years later. After spells as a Whale taxidermist, and as a reporter for the Latvian Ferret Breeders Monthly, I was imprisoned in Guadeloupe for cannibalism. I insisted at my appeal that I thought it was Kentucky Fried Chicken, but to no avail. It was there that I decided to try to become a Hematologist. I chose it at random by flipping through a Bulgarian-English dictionary. It is from my prison cell in Guadeloupe that I contribute to Wikipedia. I recently amended the Wikipedia article about me, but it was immediately reverted by "Secret Squirrel" who unfortunately obsessively reverts any amendments that contain the word "Porcupine". I usually add to Wikipedia as the notorious General Tojo.</b></p>

<p>I am not going to quibble about the 'rarely, malignancies'. But did you read the journal article? It said "and associated malignancy". Of course, this is historical, about silicone injections, but good Lord, why are you all quibbling on this? The report didn't say, 'rarely, malignancies'. It said 'associated malignancy'. I didn't write the plastic surgery journal. I wonder why do you and JFW want to minimize or color what is even in the literature? I expect if of Oliver, but geesh.jgwlaw 18:00, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Just wanted to double check that we're referring to the same article by Chen in the <i>British Journal of Plastic Surgery</i>, 1995. Yes I did read the article (perhaps maybe not as carefully as you have!). While it does say "associated malignancy" in the abstract, on the other hand, in the body of the article, it does state that "some patients have developed breast cancer after silicone injections of their breasts. However, there is no evidence that silicone injections increase the natural risk of breast cancer in women." It also gives three references. Based on these statements (which seem to downplay the risk of malignancy more than what's stated in the abstract), I don't think it's settled that silicone injections actually cause breast cancer, but am open to the possibility that it's certainly very plausible, hence the qualifying statement of "rarely." I'm not trying to minimize what's in the literature, just trying to state it more accurately. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew73_a1aa.html" title="User:Andrew73">Andrew73</a> 18:12, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&#160;? Fair comment, but the question is what causes the appearance of Mr Hyde&#160;? Reasoned discussions were taking place on the PD discussion page. The dated and timed records show that it was clearly PaulWicks that initiated personal attacks. Profsnow added to it. I merely responded to it. In last 100 "contributions" of PaulWicks he hasnot actually added anything. It coniste entirely of reverts, blocks, insults and complaints. JfdWollff ignored the reasoned discussions, provided no reasoning or evidence at all and instead just blocked my username. The culprits are Wicks, ProfsNow and Wollff.

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Looking at the <a href="../../../z/o/p/Zopiclone.html" title="Zopiclone">Zopiclone</a> enrty, it lists one of the side effects as a "bitter metallic taste". As a doctor, could you let me know the correct expression for this symptom? Thanks in advance --<a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunky_Monkey_4ee6.html" title="User:Funky Monkey"><font style="background: #CC9900" face="Ariel" color="#FFFFFF"><b>&#160;Funky Monkey&#160;</b></font></a><a href="../../../f/u/n/User_talk%7EFunky_Monkey_3c91.html" title="User talk:Funky Monkey"><font style="background:#CD00CD" face="Ariel" color="#FFFFFF"><b>&#160;(talk)&#160;</b></font></a> 01:18, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../d/y/s/Dysgeusia.html" title="Dysgeusia">Dysgeusia</a> could be a more "medical" term for altered taste, though it's not specific for metallic taste. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew73_a1aa.html" title="User:Andrew73">Andrew73</a> 18:03, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for that. I followed the link, and that also linked <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parageusia.html" title="Parageusia">Parageusia</a>. Would you say that that was a better word? --<a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunky_Monkey_4ee6.html" title="User:Funky Monkey"><font style="background: #CC9900" face="Ariel" color="#FFFFFF"><b>&#160;Funky Monkey&#160;</b></font></a><a href="../../../f/u/n/User_talk%7EFunky_Monkey_3c91.html" title="User talk:Funky Monkey"><font style="background:#CD00CD" face="Ariel" color="#FFFFFF"><b>&#160;(talk)&#160;</b></font></a> 19:12, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>This guy is just a trany homotologist. I don't know that I would listen to him. Or, maybe I would. I don't know. I wouldn't let him stick a finger in my butt, that's for sure. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../a/f/i/User%7EAfinley_6d6b.html" title="User:Afinley">Afinley</a> (<a href="../../../a/f/i/User_talk%7EAfinley_4c86.html" title="User talk:Afinley">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Afinley_d6e3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Afinley">contribs</a>).</small></p>
