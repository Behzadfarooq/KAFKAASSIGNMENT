<p>Carved out of <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andhra_Pradesh_0379.html" title="Andhra Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a> article's Politics section as it becoming messy there. Made some sections to organize. --<a href="../../../v/y/z/User%7EVyzasatya_d19c.html" title="User:Vyzasatya">Vyzasatya</a> 15:24, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi Vikram, We can sort out this editing stuff. let us discuss here --<a href="../../../v/y/z/User%7EVyzasatya_d19c.html" title="User:Vyzasatya">Vyzasatya</a> 22:22, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hello Vyzasatya:</p>
<p>You might a BIG NTR fan but please don't change the facts of AP just because YOU like him and PLEASE let a movie star be a movie start DON"T HIGHLIGHT his as "Sri Krishna Devaraya." These were your wordings: "Because of the mini-Renaissance that occurred under NTR's leadership, he is often compared to Sri Krishna Devaraya".</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong to be a FAN of NTR or anybody. Well, I am not trying to label or Bias you or anybody here just because they are fans of TDP or Congress (or they belong to a certain Caste). This bias will only lead to a fight and Hot discussion which is No different then words spoken by Fundamentalists.</p>
<p>I do like NTR and I do admire him but its not good to give 100% highlight and focus for him and Ignore the rest of the Chief ministers of A.P. I guess you will take my words in a Positive way.</p>
<p>I would really appreciate (and honor your work which you volunteered) if you can give atleast a little importance for the other chief ministers who served A.P. Well, we might like some one (they are very special to us) but when we address a state our likes/dislikes have little importance but putting facts (rather than highlighting someone we like) honors our work and is appreciated by others. You had spent a lot of effort and time in highlight NTR (thats fine) but what about other Chief Ministers&#160;? Just because they had the last Name&#160;:”REDDY” annoyed you to not even refer them once in your BIG effort of showing AP to the world&#160;? Buddy, Even they became chief Ministers when only the 6.2 crore people of A.P voted in favor of them.</p>
<p>Well, we can argue and fight based on what or who we like (we all know politics no body is ignorant). but that will only lead us to WHAT&#160;?</p>
<p>Freedom of opinion should not reflect Bias to our likes/dislikes .</p>
<p>Well, you took so much time and effort to write about NTR “ See below: "Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao (NTR) a Telugu movie star is the first chief minister from the Film community in Andhra Pradesh. NTR built his Telugu Desam Party with the support of people's dissent arising out of frequent changes in chief ministers of Andhra Pradesh by Smt.Indira Gandhi, chief of Congress party and a public insult to Sri.Tanguturi Anjaiah a chief minister by Sri. Rajiv Gandhi, son of Smt.Indira Gandhi at the Hyderabad Airport. The Telugu people were used to such acts and insult to Telugu Pride and then NTR decided to plunge into politics and found overwhelming support from the people all over AP. His campaign against Congress was aided by the coverage in the Telugu daily Eenadu, owned by media baron Ramoji Rao. NTR started a new party by name Telugu Desam (meaning, Land of Telugus) and was voted into power in a record time of 9 months. The NTR administration took steps to promote Telugu language and culture.</p>
<p>On the "Tank Bund" of the Hussain Sagar lake, NTR had statues installed of those people who unarguably contributed to Telugu/Andhra culture. These figures include famous poets, musicians, and historic figures."</p>
<p><br />
So what happened to Others&#160;? Just because you didn't liked them have they lost there importance&#160;?</p>
<p>Final advice: "What matters in the end (of our life) is how others look at us NOT what we like/dislike"</p>

<li>Please signin so that I would know who I am talking to.</li>
<li>I sure believe without any question that this article is biased.</li>
<li>The writings you attribute to me are not mine if you take time and look into history. I only reorganized stuff someone else wrote. Most of the material is only offshoot of Andhra Pradesh Politics section cleanup. I just pasted it from their so that It will be cleaned later by someone.</li>
<li>I am a Rayalaseema Reddy.(If you dont believe you can google it) I undertook the cleanup of both <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamma.html" title="Kamma">Kamma</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/d/Reddy.html" title="Reddy">Reddy</a>. I am fighting vandalism on <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamma.html" title="Kamma">Kamma</a>. If that will prove my intentions. I have never voted in India. Nor do I favor any political party. I did some work on YSR article too. you can check.</li>
<li>I am a sysop in telugu wikipedia and always tried to maintain NPOV.</li>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>My name is Varun Vuppala, and I think I need to step into the discussion here, since a lot of the edits that seem to be causing rife are my work.</p>
<p>First off, I moved to the States after LKG, so I am *definitely* not biased in Andhra politics. All I did was clean up the article a bit. I did notice that the article was NPOV, but as you can imagine, I only know NTR from watching movies with my parents.</p>
<p>I changed the original, "Thanks to his contribution to Telugus, one often sees him as the second <a href="../../../k/r/i/Krishnadevaraya.html" title="Krishnadevaraya">Sri Krishna Devaraya</a>. Krishna Devaraya is the ruler of <a href="../../../v/i/j/Vijayanagar_empire.html" title="Vijayanagar empire">Vijayanagar empire</a> whose capital is <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hampi.html" title="Hampi">Hampi</a>."</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>"Because of the mini-Renaissance that occured under NTR's leadership, he is often compared to <a href="../../../k/r/i/Krishnadevaraya.html" title="Krishnadevaraya">Sri Krishna Devaraya</a>."</p>
<p>I did not write the original article. I simply edited it to make it more readable, and a little less biased.</p>
<p>Look forward to working with you guys to add about other Andhra CMs here.</p>
