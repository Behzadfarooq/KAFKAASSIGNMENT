<p>Hi there, I just wanted to let you know a couple things about keeping talk pages easy to read.</p>
<p>The first is that you can sign your name to your posts by typing four tildes (~~~~), I see that you have been signing all your posts, which is great, but it really helps if you sign using the standard method used by all users...this improves readability and also provides a handy link to your userpage. It seems that you might be signing differently because you want your sig to display a certain way, and that is fine too...you can customize how your signature appears (if you would like help doing this, feel free to ask and I'll help any way I can). Many people customize their signatures in very interesting ways!</p>
<p>The second thing I wanted to mention was that posting your message in the middle of another person's post can be very confusing. Other people's comments can always be quoted within your post if you'd like to respond to a specific part...again, feel free to ask if you'd like any help with this. Thanks. <a href="../../../b/c/a/User%7EBcatt_84c6.html" title="User:Bcatt">bcatt</a> 18:45, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The continual reversion of this page is neither helpful nor appreciated. There has already been an RFC on the issue of whether or not the list should be included, and the consensus (which you can clearly see on the talk page) was overwhelming in favor of removing it. <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVariable_3b71.html" title="User:Variable">siafu</a> 15:36, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Siafu, Have any of you RFCs bothered to study the topic of Police States? I know you haven't. How about sticking to topics you HAVE studied. You know. Like video games. A majority of the world was wrong about the world being flat. You under-achiever psuedo-academics are wrong about removing the list from Police States. Read a book.

<dd>Starheart, I gotta shake my head, you're making a huge assumption here that the rest of us don't have real world experience, and that's neither right nor polite. Whether the list is a good idea or not has nothing to do with the reality of what Police States are, torture and murder of people by governments is, etc. This is neither the time nor the place to be having a size queen contest about how many friends, family members, or aquaintences of ours and yours have been victims of police states. If you happen across me in a bar we can drink to absent friends, but please be civil here. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 03:49, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Notwithstanding the altogether appropriate points raised by George and Rhobite, inter al., I, having happened upon this discussion after seeing the note at AN/I, am altogether confused. Here, supra, you advise that editors should "[r]ead a book", lest they should continue to be ill-informed "pseudo-academics". In your edits to the police state article, though, you suggest that "factual edits can actually be based on experience, rather than just being based upon [sic] a BOOK" (one observes that you've constructed a <a href="../../../f/a/l/False_dilemma.html" title="False dilemma">false dilemma</a> here, inasmuch as one can cite books that refer to experiences, and, further, that the implementation of your suggestion would eviscerate <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>). I wonder, then, which it is: are the editors of the "police state" page (amongst which number I don't count myself) insufficiently well-read or exorbitantly absorbed with books?? I know, I know, <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don%27t_feed_the_troll.html" title="Don't feed the troll">don't feed the trolls</a>, but... <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 04:00, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear glib cutey, Ignorance is ignorance. Knowledge is knowledge, regardless of the source. It appears that your peers and you are remiss this concept. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarHeart_4356.html" title="User:StarHeart">StarHeart</a> 04:14, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I hope I'm the "glib cutey". I should say, of course, that you are altogether correct that "knowledge is knowledge", but that an encyclopedia requires verifiable, objective, non-first-person-experiential contributions. No one seeks to disabuse you of your knowledge or to deprive you of your right to disseminate that knowledge on your own, but only to suggest that, even as you may be altogether certain of something (and may, in fact, be correct), outside sourcing is required. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 04:21, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Begs the question then of who needs just another online encyclopedia when with the awesome outreach of the Internet, cumulative insight can be amassed. Hamstring potential?

<dd>StarHeart, it is easy to write a message on a talk page. You would be able to achieve much more here if you just used talk pages, instead of inserting personal comments into actual articles.

<p>Hypocrite!! Deleting valid information from the Dictatorship page is YOUR vandalism. I assume you don't know that because you were raised in a police state. There appears to be ignorant people censoring the Astrology article, the Supernatural Project, the Police State article, and even my own Andrew Homer Article.

<p>Hi, I thought I would clear up a few things and make sure you knew what is happening at your Andrew Homer page. First of all, I am sure you know a hell of a lot more about astrology than me - which is fine. You also, obviously, know more about yourself than I do. Neither, however is reason enough for you to be the authority on these matters here on wikipedia, as we also have a (to me at least) hell of a lot of policies (see the welcome notice you got). The problem with astrology is that we cannot write it up as fact unless it has been scientifically tested (and citations for this is very much needed). The problem with your personal page is that unless you are a significantly <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notable</a>, it is not material for wikipedia - and furthermore, there are problems with <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_page_2e5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity page">Wikipedia:Vanity_page</a> and the policy on [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Cite_sources|citing" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Cite_sources|citing" rel="nofollow">sources</a>]. I recommend the page be moved to your userpage (and feel free to change your username to Andrew Homer if you wish). Regards, <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELundse_a2f1.html" title="User:Lundse">Lundse</a> 10:07, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We can write it up as documented fact that people believe these things, even if the things they believe in are not scientifically provable fact. The verifyability criterion does not require that things be objectively true, just demonstratably reliably accurate information. That people believe in astrology, and what those beliefs are, can be demonstrably and reliably accurately validated by references to astrology publications and so forth.</dd>
<dd>That information has to be properly labeled as a belief and not an established fact, but that's just a neutral point of view issue. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 22:35, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Whose "verifyability criterion"??? I hope you're not referring to the fraudulent demands of the Amazing Randi. If everything that can be discovered has been discovered, why is the Patent Office still open? If you ever bothered to take a history of science class, or read a book on the topic (I'm sorry but NOT everything pertinent is on the Internet), you would learn that throughout history, a lot of facts were assumed BEFORE being "scientifically" verified. Just because the reseach tools, themselves, have YET to prove proficiency does NOT mean that the topic being examined is invalid. The validity of Astrology has yet to be challenged by subsequent breakthroughs in physics. Actually, thanks to 'Hyperdimensional Space" the physicists are getting CLOSER to explaining how and why Astrology works!! You debunkers, pretending to be sceptics, insist on taking the bread out of the oven before the yeast kicks in. Stop pretending to know more than you do.

If you will look at any article on Wikipedia, you might notice that there are no signatures in any of them. A signature within the text of an article is grossly inappropriate. Furthermore, your additions have always been written in the first person ("I don't believe", "I have never heard", etc.). If you will look at any article on Wikipedia or, indeed, open up any print encyclopedia, you might notice that all articles are written in the third person ("Few people believe", "No claim has been made", etc.).

<p>Hi! It's wonderful that you're contributing to Wikipedia! However, please differentiate the Talk pages and the actual article itself before posting personal opinion. Talk pages are solely for the purpose of discussing the article and its contents. It's perfectly fine to add any personal opinion to the talk pages. The article itself, however, should never contain personal opinion. Adding personal comments to an article is considered vandalism and isn't tolerated lightly.

<p>You claim that: "a stock market forecasting newsletter published by an Astrologer is voted as one of the best year after year", for which I would love to see a citation (or at least get the name of the newsletter).</p>
<p>You also claim that "it's the TOOLS of scientific research which have yet to catch up to Astrology to explain its validity". This is a bit confused, it is not the goal of scientific reasearch to "explain" validity, it is the goal to <i>find out whether something is valid or not</i>. There are plenty of ways to do this for astrology, and quite a few have been tried. If you meant to say that this is the task for which science/common sense is not up for, please explain why not.</p>
<p>You also claim that gravity is a part of quantum physics (its a Newtonian concept) and that because new scientific hypotheses do not use it this somehow "gives evem more credibility to the claims of Astrologers." Please explain how this is, does the new scientific concept of "attraction" tell anything about how planets affect people besides (seemingly, to our eyes) attracting them? <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELundse_a2f1.html" title="User:Lundse">Lundse</a> 11:57, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So hyperdimensional space explains how common sense is not up to the task of testing astrology? And how planets influence me? I know what string theory is, but unfortunately for your argument I also know that it does not do away with the Einsteinian view of gravity - it merely adds to it, positing that there could be other dimensions to which gravitrons escape. How does this fact (that different dimensions "exchange" gravitrons) give credibility to astrology?</dd>

<p>So, during these last 35 years, how many natal charts have you read for customers to elicit a thumbs-up or a thumbs-down response, rather than just cowardly hiding in front of a keyboard impressing yourself with your unsubstantiated opinions?

<p>Just as soon as you fakes actually make the effort to study the topic you're debunking, then you'll deserve respect. Not until then. 35 years ago I was a sceptic of Astrology. But unlike you unethical debunkers, I made the effort to study the topic and found an amazing portion of it actually works!! So, stop projecting your lack of integrity onto those of us who have made an HONEST effort to assess the validity of Astrology.

The best evidence you have mentioned is this newsletter, please let me know the name so I can start studying...</dd>
<dd>And I have studied the topic (which is validity and science), have you? The only thing I need from astrology are its proofs and claims - the claims are wide and varied and the proofs are lacking (for some reason, the astrologers I have met seem to be more interested in saying that I do not know enough instead of providing me with data, very odd). <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELundse_a2f1.html" title="User:Lundse">Lundse</a> 07:22, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

After 2 weeks I'm still want you to explain the Jupiter/Pluto midpoint in your natal chart. OR GET LOST!!! Obviously, your "problems" which magnetizes you to a topic which you're not qualified to discuss plus your confession that you haven't studied Astrology PROVES you have "issues" you're not dealing with. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Homer_3ed5.html" title="User:Andrew Homer">Andrew Homer</a> 11:53, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First of all, please note that I never claimed to know anything about astrology, but about scientific objectivity and validity. These were the topics being discussed (and applied to astrology, which is why you and other astrologer's input is needed and appreciated). I will not "get lost" as I have something to contribute to the debate on validity, if you believe one must have studied astrology before one can talk scientific validity, please raise this as a seperate point and present your argument.</dd>
<dd>More importantly, I have had enough of your personal attacks now. I asked you whether you were going to stop and between the new personal attacks I sensed that you would not. Now I ask you one last time to stop throwing out stuff like "You insist on double-talk", "lack of integrity", "OR GET LOST!!!" or saying that I have "problems" and "issues" i'm not dealing with. I see myself forced to file a complaint about your behaviour if you do not.</dd>

<dd>Gee, the unethical &amp; mean-spirited bullies keep proving how insecure they are in front of a keyboard. What a suprise! They can't win rational discourse, but they flaunt the lose standards where anyone can become a Wikipedia monitor. I like challenging debaters. No challenges here. Just the petty proving how unqualified they are debating informed Astrologers. Let the pogroms &amp; krystallnachts BEGIN!! Anyone have a Geocosmic Journal on them that I could read, while the debunkers are waiting for their puberty to kick in? So, how does one deal with those proud of their ignorance? Notice no constructive input from the so-called "monitors." Us real Astrologers are bad people, because the inadequate keep lurking on article pages over their head and then harrass us who do comprehend the topic. No justice here. Just pathetic egos.

<dd>As a typical unethical debunker (Republican?) you put words in my mouth. I never stated ANYTHING about "uncritical". It's about mean-spirited attackers who do NOT even bother to study the topic. What course in the scientific method or course in ethical journalism expounds expressing an opinion without even bothering to study the topic? Besides proving lack of knowledge you guys are also proving lack of morals. The standards to be a monitor onboard Wikipedia are clearly low. No attempt regarding integrity, ethics, honor or honesty on your part.
