<h2><span class="mw-headline">Torino vs. Turin</span></h2>
<p>The TV announcers are calling it Torino. What do we know that they don't know? <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 20:17, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The "TV announcers" are <i>marketing</i> the games using the Italian name -- incorrectly. They say "Torino, Italy" when it should be "Turin, Italy" (English) or "Torino, Italia" (Italian), take your pick. I saw a map on NBC that showed Rome, Florence, Venice and Torino. Dumb. If they wanted Italian, it should have said Roma, Firenze, Venezia and Torino.</dd>
<dd>Also note that the Associated Press, BBC, Canadian Press, Reuters, CNN, Sports Illustrated, etc. all use "Turin" in their English language coverage, so it's not like I'm forcing something against all common usage in English language media.</dd>
<dd>I am trying to update the English Wikipedia pages for correctness and consistency. Note that the root page of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Winter_Olympics_f27d.html" title="2006 Winter Olympics">2006 Winter Olympics</a> explains the Torino/Turin issue, and (correctly) uses Turin in the right context. The Italian page at <a href="../../../../it/x/x/_/XX_Olimpiade_Invernale_0b22.html" class="extiw" title="it:XX_Olimpiade_Invernale">it:XX_Olimpiade_Invernale</a> uses Torino, which is perfectly appropriate. I note that the Italian page uses "Stati Uni", "Svezia", and "Norvegia" (for example) in its medal table, so just as they have (correctly) used Italian place names on an Italian Wikipedia page, we should use English place names on English Wikipedia pages. See <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28use_English%29_65c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English)</a> for more details</dd>
<dd>Thank you for posting your question here instead of taking a knee-jerk reaction to revert my changes. I appreciate that! <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrwsc_0d9e.html" title="User:Andrwsc">Andrwsc</a> 20:38, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My knees are hurting today from too much knee-jerking already, and I couldn't take any more.&#160;:) If anyone else wants to fight with you over that, I'll let you and them handle it. You might be right that they are "marketing" the name, but it does appear on the banner, so it's hard to avoid. Is it Ford that makes or used to make a car called the Torino? If so, Ford should be an official sponsor, as it would be free advertising, don'cha know. Actually, I would be very happy if we English speakers would refer to those cities by their "real" names such as Roma, Venezia, etc. But the expression, "Torino, Italy" is definitely a mixed metaphor. One other oddity I've noticed: no small number of announcers are pronouncing the name as if it were spelled "Turino". Go figure. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 20:57, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, I think that many place names have been "unnecessarily Anglicized" in history, but for many places, it <b>is</b> necessary. For example, there are no accented characters (such as "ü") in the English alphabet, so we can't write "München" in English. (I can't tell you why it ended up being called Munich instead of Muenchen, which uses the normal way of converting the German ü to English "ue".) There are also pronunciation differences, such as the English W having the same sound as the German V (and vice versa); this is one reason why "Wien" becomes "Vienna" in English. And I won't even get into places like 北京, which becomes either Peking, Pei-ching, Běijīng, or Beijing, depending on which system you use to "romanize" Chinese characters....
<dl>
<dd>Let alone the question of how "Deutschland" became "Germany" in English. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 19:37, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>As for the games logo, well, the 2004 summer games logo included Αθήνα, which becomes like <i>Athína</i> when "romanized", but I <b>never</b> saw any English reference to the city as anything other than Athens.</dd>
<dd>Note that I have absolutely no issue with the use of "Torino" when referring to the <i>name</i> of the games (e.g. as "Torino 2006"), but I will make the change to "Turin" when referring to the <i>city</i> on an English language Wikipedia page. I would also support any French editor who wants to refer to "Londres" <b>on French Wikipedia pages</b> as host city of the 2012 summer games.</dd>
<dd>I like your idea of bringing back the Ford Torino. &#160;;) <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrwsc_0d9e.html" title="User:Andrwsc">Andrwsc</a> 23:25, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If NBC is "marketing" the games as "Torino", they aren't doing a very good job of it, since apparently nobody is watching in the USA. Maybe they just wanted to keep "Turin" shrouded. However, if the games overall are successful, the city could host them again soon. One good Turin deserves another.&#160;:) <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 19:37, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see there's already a topic about it here, so I won't start a new one, but instead post my opinion here: Who cares what the city is called in English? Keeping with the name of the campaign would make a more sense when referring to the games. Otherwise, if you're so obsessed with the name of the place, you should use the correct names of the sites where the actual events took place: no cross-country skier, curler, biathlete or alpine skier took a medal in Turin, but in Pragelato, Pinerolo, Cesana and Sestriere. --<a href="../../../x/-/f/User%7EX-Flare-x_78f9.html" title="User:X-Flare-x">x-Flare-x</a> 22:50, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My objection is specifically to the use of "Torino, Italy". The city can be called "Turin, Italy" or it can be called "Torino, Italia", but <b>not</b> the goofy hybrid promoted by NBC and others. Of those two choices, "Turin, Italy" makes the most sense for English language Wikipedia, as per standard naming conventions. If you've seen some of my edits, you'll see that I've left a lot of references to "Torino" alone — where it is used in the right context. I will continue to change "Torino, Italy" however. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrwsc_0d9e.html" title="User:Andrwsc">Andrwsc</a> 23:00, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If I have understood correctly, in English we say that the Torino Winter olympics were hosted in Turin, Italy. So if you're talking about the olympics, you should call them Torino, but the city is called Turin in English. I've got this view from looking at the International Olympic Committee website (<a href="http://www.olympic.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.olympic.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.olympic.org/</a> ) where these olympics are always referred to as Torino. I think that the IOC name for the olympics is the official one, as it is, well, the International Olympics Committee. --<a href="../../../h/j/v/User%7EHJV_25e2.html" title="User:HJV">HJV</a> 00:17, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please read some of the comments above - it's quite clear. The name of the games is "Torino 2006", not any other variation. Any reference to the <b>games</b> using that name will be untouched. However, the <b>city name</b> remains "Turin" in the English language. Therefore, I will edit any article that says something like "Joe Bloggs won the dogsled racing at the 2006 Winter Olympics in <i>Torino</i>". That's just wrong. If the author refers to the "Torino 2006" games, such as found on several references on the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Winter_Olympics_f27d.html" title="2006 Winter Olympics">2006 Winter Olympics</a> page, then that's correct and will be left alone. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrwsc_0d9e.html" title="User:Andrwsc">Andrwsc</a> 00:23, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Jonel. First, I want to say that I appreciate a lot of the work you have done for the Olympic pages. I have been making lots of recent contributions, including finishing a complete set of "Canada at the xxxx Olympics" pages and also filling in some gaps for various sports pages. Anyway, I see that you reverted my edit to the 1900 page, with respect to the Luxembourgish athlete. I guess the issue is this: what should we take as the <i>official</i> source for medals? The IOC web site shows <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michel_Th%C3%A9ato_3ab7.html" title="Michel Théato">Michel Théato</a> winning the medal for France, but as you have pointed out, it was discovered later that he was from Luxembourg. I presume the IOC doesn't recognize that yet. I'm a bit concerned that we're trying to override an official source, but if you feel strongly about it, we should at least add a footnote to the 1900 page since the Wikipedia table differs from the IOC table referenced from that page! <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrwsc_0d9e.html" title="User:Andrwsc">Andrwsc</a> 18:05, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi there. You're absolutely right that we should have a footnote. I've added it, and a couple references supporting his Luxembourg nationality. I don't particularly think we should take any single source as "official" as to someone's nationality, but rather should look at all sources and attempt to determine what is accurate (whilst noting any discrepancies, as I ought to have done at first but have now rectified&#160;;)). I should probably do the same with 1896. <b>That</b> year has some really screwy things going on with the IOC count--the IOC counts <a href="../../../d/i/o/Dionysios_Kasdaglis_7b1c.html" title="Dionysios Kasdaglis">Dionysios Kasdaglis</a> as Greek for his tennis singles medal, but when he is paired with a Greek athlete for the doubles competition, the IOC gives that silver medal to Mixed Team ZZX!! Obviously, things become much simpler once NOCs are introduced. <i>So much nicer</i>. --</dd>

<dd>Hi Jonel, I think your footnotes on the 1900 page are well written, so thanks for that. I'm still a bit concerned at the precendent set here. We don't want to open the door for the politically charged folks to start reassigning medals. One good example is the case of the Korean athletes who were forced to compete under Japan in the 1936 (I think) games, due to the occupation of Korea by Japan. I am not insensitive to their situation (having to use Japanese names instead of their own names, etc.), but the last thing I want to see is an editor reassigning those medals from JPN to KOR because of what happened. Wikipedia is not the place to rewrite history, but to document it in a NPOV manner. In the case of Michel Théato, my preference would be to still follow the IOC count, but use the footnote to describe the situation with his LUX nationality. That way, Wikipedia is 100% consistent with the IOC records, but still allows for the reporting of new facts. As you undoubtedly have seen, medal counts are an extremely sensitive topic for a lot of people, and I think we (as Olympic Wikipedia editors) have to work very hard to present the facts as neutrally as possible. If you feel strongly about assigning this medal to LUX in our tables, then I won't revert it on you, but I wanted to let you know my motivation here.

<dd>I guess the line I would draw is that once NOCs are implemented, it is a fairly simple matter of fact to say that X athlete competed through the auspices of Y NOC. Korean athletes competing for the Japanese committee should have a footnote explaining that, but the count should include them under JPN. At that point (but not in 1900), "JPN", "KOR", "FRA", and "LUX" referred to specific organisations not entirely connected to the political entities by whose names those committees are typically called. This is the same reason that <a href="../../../m/i/a/Mia_Audina_982d.html" title="Mia Audina">Mia Audina</a>'s medals go under different nations in different years. Even though she is Indonesian, she competes (now) for the Netherlands NOC. Trying to change her second medal to counting for INA would be wrong, as Audina specifically competes for NED. Théato, on the other hand, did not compete for FRA. -- <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonel_e850.html" title="User:Jonel">Jonel</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJonel_1c2e.html" title="User talk:Jonel">Speak</a> 19:44, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The UN does not recognise the post-1992 as a successor of the pre-1992 one (SFRY), and the post-1992 was admitted as a new member. Was it the case for the IOC as well?

(That way, the vandal can abuse that page all he wants) I would like to keep the Olympic Sport page as clean and short as possible.

<dd>Maybe... I actually got the idea to do this a few days ago — before Roitr's edits — because the IOC website also has a section for "recognized" sports. When I saw his new "Candidate sports" section, I cringed at the speculative way in which it was written, but I thought the underlying motivation was actually fairly sound. Certainly, we need a place to describe the history and process of how &amp; why sports were added and deleted, and I think we're getting there. As for <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olympic_sports.html" title="Olympic sports">Olympic sports</a> itself, I agree that it is getting somewhat large, so perhaps we should use that page to focus on the current program, with an appropriate link to <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demonstration_sport.html" title="Demonstration sport">Demonstration sport</a> as the main article for that section, a link to Sports recognized by the IOC (or a better name) as the main article for that section, etc.</dd>
<dd>With respect to handling Roitr, I am also frustrated at many of his tactics, but to be honest, my opinion has changed a bit lately. He really seems to have put in some effort to reconcile the discrepancies with the list at <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demonstration_sport.html" title="Demonstration sport">Demonstration sport</a>, for example. I do know that back-and-forth recert wars are never effective with him, so for things like his addition of sync. skating as a demo in 2002 or speed skiing on the 2010 possibles list, I think the best approach is to just add the {{citationneeded}} template instead of deletion.

<dd>I agree. Putting up 1 page devoted to the current Olympic programme, then having with in that page links to a "Past Olympic sports" page, a "Sports Recognized by the IOC" page, and of course the "Demonstration sport" page would be great. I'll go along with the <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citation_needed.html" title="Citation needed">citation needed</a> route for now, but I'm still peeved at this user's tactics. The formats for these pages are starting to come together. Looks alot better and more organized. Good job.</dd>

<p>You sir, (ma'am?) are freaking brilliant!!! Great job on finding out the info on there being NO demonstration sprorts for Atlanta 1996 and Sydney 2000. Now if only we could find the same thing on the 1994 and 2002 winter olympic offical reports. I wish I could have taken the time to find out myself. Oh man, I hope this stop Roitr from putting up bogus information again... or is that just wishful thinking? Once again, good work! ADD: Another good thing you might try is actually put those references that you have on the "edit history" page on the actual page itself. I know it's kind of redundant with the source section already listing the website that hosts the offical reports, but I would just like those up front and center.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">New IOC flag template</span></h2>
<p>I would like to express my concerns over the new IOC template you have created for athletes. Using <a href="../../../b/i/a/Biathlon_at_the_Winter_Olympics_dba1.html" title="Biathlon at the Winter Olympics">Biathlon at the Winter Olympics</a> as an example I have noticed that you have excluded the full names of the countries when listing the athletes. I am sure that you have your reasons, such as, including the official code the IOC uses when naming athletes as well as shortening the space used within the boxes. I would like to see that the full names of the countries be restored. For the everyday reader, more likely than not they won't know what each particular code refers to. This topic has been discussed before on the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Sports_Olympics_4041.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Sports Olympics">Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Sports_Olympics</a> discussion page. While it may be very convenient from an editing point of view, to the casual reader, seeing all those codes can be confusing. I propose changing it so that the full name (to an extent.. NOT to spell out the ENTIRE name such as Islamic Republic of Iran, etc.) appears in underscript in small letters. That way just a bit more room will be used in the boxes, but it will still have a low profile. <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerakhantu_3ed3.html" title="User:Perakhantu">Perakhantu</a> 05:48, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, if you look at the previous version of that page, it didn't use full country names either. There's nothing to "restore". It also used the 3 letter IOC code in parenthesis after the athlete's name -- but with a wikilink to the country article. That's why I used it as my "guinea pig" for the new {{flagIOCathlete}} template. I think links from GER to <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> in that context are useless instead of linking to <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany_at_the_2006_Winter_Olympics_a9d2.html" title="Germany at the 2006 Winter Olympics">Germany at the 2006 Winter Olympics</a> (for example).</dd>
<dd>In fact, it is far more common to find that layout on Olympic pages (i.e. flag + athlete name + IOC code) than any other layout, and my motivation is to use a template so that wikilinks, flags, etc. are all consistently formatted. As for the "everyday reader", there are multiple clues to help identify the country. The full country name is displayed in a hover box when you move over the flag, and of course, the IOC code links to the "Country at the xxx Olympics" article (and you get that name in the hover box when you mouse over that too).</dd>
<dd>I can appreciate that a handful of pages use the full country name, so I do not intend to change that formatting, but I will make edits on pages that use the same format as the new template. The beauty, of course, is that if we decide that the full country name is better, then a single edit to the template code instantly changes <b>ALL</b> pages that use the template, and they are all instantly consistent....</dd>
<dd>As for the length of names, I have made some changes to the appropriate templates that use so that none of the country names are too long (e.g. {{flagIOC|IRI}} generates just <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Iran.svg_133f.html" class="image" title="Iran"><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/ca/Flag_of_Iran.svg/22px-Flag_of_Iran.svg.png" alt="Iran" width="22" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Iran.svg_133f.html" /></a> Iran now.)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Sport templates</span></h2>
<p>hello again. On some of the winter olympic pages, I have noticed a sport template at the bottom of the page that contains the sports that were competed at those games. Here are a couple of examples: <a href="../../../1/9/2/1928_Winter_Olympics_3280.html" title="1928 Winter Olympics">1928 Winter Olympics</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/3/1932_Winter_Olympics_7dcf.html" title="1932 Winter Olympics">1932 Winter Olympics</a>. Since the sports have already been listed near the top of the pages under "Medals awarded", do you think this is a bit redundant? I'm not saying you, yourself, put those templates in, but since you seem to be doing a great job at creating and using templates on various pages, I thought I would talk to you about the matter. What do you think? <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerakhantu_3ed3.html" title="User:Perakhantu">Perakhantu</a> 20:42, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I didn't create those templates (but I have done some cleanup work on them where necessary). I guess my opinion is that navigation boxes can be quite helpful, but they should <i>enhance</i> the article, but not overwhelm it. For example, on all of the "Sport at the xxx Olympics" pages, there tend to be a pair of nav. boxes at the bottom - one for the sport, and one for the events of the Games. This makes great sense. I also like the country-specific nav. boxes at the end of the "Country at the xxx Olympics" pages. However, I think the "NOC at the xxx Olympics" boxes are too excessive (esp. for recent Games). To answer your specific question, I think that: 1) the "Medals awarded" section would be better named "Events" or similar, and include more than just a simple list. It should also have some commentary, perhaps on differences from the previous Games, etc. 2) the Events nav. box at the bottom of the page is mostly intended for each "Sport at the xxx Olympics" page, and I think the main parent page for each Games looks better without it (esp. since those pages have the monster Olympics nav. box instead), so I would support you removing them from the handful of Games pages that have them, citing consistency etc. If you need a good example, look at <a href="../../../1/8/9/1896_Summer_Olympics_2993.html" title="1896 Summer Olympics">1896 Summer Olympics</a>, which is a featured article. I really like the layout of that, esp. with the commentary on each sport with a link to the per-sport article. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrwsc_0d9e.html" title="User:Andrwsc">Andrwsc</a> 22:35, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I just happened to stumble across this while looking at my watchlist. I don't have any opinions on the original question, but I do have a fairly strong opinion on the NOC at the xxxx Olympics templates on the various country pages. I know that for some of the recent Games pages they seem a bit overwhelming, but I believe that's due to lack of other content vs. the boxes themselves. Personally, I find them very useful as I'm often navigating between the various countries when working on a block of Olympic pages. <a href="../../../s/u/e/User%7ESue_Anne_8203.html" title="User:Sue Anne">Sue Anne</a> 22:43, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I certainly can't disagree with <i>editors</i> using them to jump from country to country (as I have done that too!), but I question whether that is a natural way for a <i>reader</i> to browse Wikipedia. I'm just not "sold" on them, so I'm certainly not going to remove them or anything. In fact, I've added a couple of missing ones and done some double-checks on existing ones, so the fact that it's on my personal list of things to care about should tell you that I'm not totally against them... <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrwsc_0d9e.html" title="User:Andrwsc">Andrwsc</a> 22:50, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Just a couple of comments: 1. I'm not too sure about having such a big template for listing all the participating countries on each country page. Even for pages that are well developed such as <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_at_the_2004_Summer_Olympics_ad88.html" title="United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics">United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics</a>, the box at the bottom of the page is huge and just seems to unwieldy to have.</li>
</ul>
<p>2. I looked at the <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swimming_at_the_2004_Summer_Olympics_27d2.html" title="Swimming at the 2004 Summer Olympics">Swimming at the 2004 Summer Olympics</a>, and I noticed a template at the top of the page that contains all the swimming events. Isn't that redundant? The reader can just click on the seperate events that are listed with the medal winners. 136.168.108.12 19:44, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My replies: 1. I think I agree with you; I'm not a huge fan of those "Nations in the xxx Olympics" templates. I didn't originally create them. However, assuming they <b>do</b> remain, then I will do my best to ensure that they are <i>accurate</i>. I've recently been creating some "Country at the xxx Olympics" stubs to get rid of redlinks on the "home page" for those Games, and I'm putting those navigation boxes at the bottom to ensure <b>consistency</b>. I'd be perfectly happy without those nav boxes, but that means that we have to get rid of all of them. It's got to be all or nothing, and right now I'm assuming they should all be there.</dd>
<dd>2. I'm not a fan of those event nav boxes either. What I'm working towards is that each "Sport at the xxx Olympics" page has a "Medal summary" table, with links to per-event articles. Therefore, it becomes the "root" page for navigation. I think the argument for those nav boxes is that you could easily go from 100 free to 200 free (for example), without having to move back to the "root" and then clicking on the next event. For example, look at how I laid out <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swimming_at_the_1964_Summer_Olympics_ac80.html" title="Swimming at the 1964 Summer Olympics">Swimming at the 1964 Summer Olympics</a> or <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athletics_at_the_1928_Summer_Olympics_9f43.html" title="Athletics at the 1928 Summer Olympics">Athletics at the 1928 Summer Olympics</a> for two examples.</dd>
<dd>In both cases, I think you ought to start the discussion at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Sports_Olympics_4041.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Sports Olympics">Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject Sports Olympics</a> where you'll get a broader audience than just me!</dd>

<p>I was at a loss over what to do with this page. I can see pros and cons of it being a full article instead of a disambiguation page, so I'm pleased you have picked up the ball.</p>
<p>My view having found the page a while ago was that there were already individual pages for some of the yachting events, so this page per se was redundant except as a disambiguation page, with the multiple year template acting as he disambiguation.</p>
<p>I feel the article itself, if it is to be a full article, should have the name of the nation and each crew member of each boat in the G/S/B columns.</p>

<dd>Yup, that's exactly the intent. There are a complete set of articles like that (see <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_Olympic_medalists_6181.html" title="Lists of Olympic medalists">Lists of Olympic medalists</a>, or <a href="../../../o/l/y/Category%7EOlympic_medalists_by_sport_ad49.html" title="Category:Olympic medalists by sport">Category:Olympic medalists by sport</a>) that parallel the set of pages for each sport (i.e. <a href="../../../s/a/i/Sailing_at_the_Summer_Olympics_dede.html" title="Sailing at the Summer Olympics">Sailing at the Summer Olympics</a> in this case - see <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olympic_sports.html" title="Olympic sports">Olympic sports</a> for links to full list). When complete, we'll end up with a page that summarizes the Olympic history of the sport, with the evolution of the program, combined medal table, etc. and the second page with the list of medal winners by event. Here's some examples of these pages that are pretty much complete: <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speed_skating_at_the_Winter_Olympics_4142.html" title="Speed skating at the Winter Olympics">Speed skating at the Winter Olympics</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Olympic_medalists_in_speed_skating_b936.html" title="List of Olympic medalists in speed skating">List of Olympic medalists in speed skating</a>, or <a href="../../../b/o/x/Boxing_at_the_Summer_Olympics_d72a.html" title="Boxing at the Summer Olympics">Boxing at the Summer Olympics</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Olympic_medalists_in_boxing_77e6.html" title="List of Olympic medalists in boxing">List of Olympic medalists in boxing</a>.. It would be too much to put that all into one page, so they complement each other nicely and can each be categorized appropriately. Yes, the single "Olympic medalists in <i>sport</i>" pages duplicate the information found on all of the specific "<i>Sport</i> at the <i>year</i> Olympics" pages, but I think there is tremendous value in having a list of all winners for a specific event put together. You can see how some nations dominate certain events over time, repeat medal winning athletes, etc. Thanks for the comments! <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrwsc_0d9e.html" title="User:Andrwsc">Andrwsc</a> 09:33, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's my understanding that sources should be cited in each applicable article. Recently, I have seen certain frequently used sources like census reports cited with a link to the citation instead of repeating the citation in every location. I imagine that format is only really suitable when there are hundreds of references and when the source will change due to updates (as would be the case with a census). <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EErechtheus_2543.html" title="User:Erechtheus">Erechtheus</a> 16:51, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">medal tables</span></h2>
<p>whoa whoa. Is it such a good idea to put the medal tables down the page that far? I think for most readers, one of the first things they would like to see is the medla tables, and see how their country did from Olympiad to Olympiad. If anything, I would like to see the medal tables near the top, maybe after the introduction and before the highlights. Do you think this would make another discussion on the Olympic talk page? <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerakhantu_3ed3.html" title="User:Perakhantu">Perakhantu</a> 04:59, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Perakhantu. I have been moving the medal table section after the participating nations section for a couple of reasons. First, it matches the structure of the <a href="../../../1/8/9/1896_Summer_Olympics_2993.html" title="1896 Summer Olympics">1896 Summer Olympics</a> article, which is the lone featured article in that series. I think that article serves as a good model for all the main Olympics articles. For example, the "Sport by sport overview" is really well done (with links to each sport page as a main article) rather than the typical treatment on most of the other pages, which is just a bulleted list of links. Second, I think that sequence of sections (sports, followed by list of nations, followed by medal table) seems to be the most "natural way" of telling the "story" of each Games. Putting the medal table first seems to me to be like reading the last chapter of a novel first.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, I think the medal tables have pretty high prominence already, since you can directly get there from any of the Games pages or from the main Olympics navigation box, and once there, you have an easy navigation to see the Games by Games tables. Therefore, the "top ten" list on the Games home pages is going to be less useful for that purpose. Certainly, unless the reader is looking for a nation that is regularly in the top ten, he/she will click to the full table anyway and navigate from there.</dd>
<dd>Lastly, one of the things I strongly believe needs to be on the "home" country at the Olympics page (e.g. <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada_at_the_Summer_Olympics_e6fb.html" title="Canada at the Summer Olympics">Canada at the Summer Olympics</a>) is a table showing the medal counts from every Games. That would certainly be the easiest way of seeing "how their country did from Olympiad to Olympiad". Unfortunately, those set of pages are sorely lacking right now. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrwsc_0d9e.html" title="User:Andrwsc">Andrwsc</a> 16:38, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, while there are a few things I agree with you on, I really disagree with you on other points. As far as the 1896 Summer Olympics page goes, while it <i>is</i> a featured article, I don't feel it should be the one, true model that all other pages should adopt. Like any other page, even featured articles can be modified, improved upon, and even changed. Which brings me to my second point. While at first glance, the idea of having a brief overview of each sport sounds like a good idea, do you relaize how incredibly unwieldy it would be for the recent olympics? By having an overview for each sport with <b>28 SPORTS IN 2004</b>, it would create a gigantic page with much tedious scrolling. I like having the sports listed the way they are, but maybe with a bit more prominance (bigger text for example).. or something to draw attention to those sport links.</dd>
<dd>I still believe that the medal table should be near the top of the page, maybe even incorperated into the Olympics info-box. While it is true that it only provides the top 10 countries in medals awarded, I believe the reader would like to have <i>immediate</i> access to a bit of information that pretty much sums up each edition of the olympics without having to scroll down.</dd>
<dd>Now as for the overall layout of the page, how would you square what goes on at the 1896 page to the 2004 page? I'm not being sarcastic, but would really like to know how you plan to go about this. The 2004 Summer Olympics page contains quite a bit of information but has sections that.. well.. lets face it.. won't EVER be on the 1896 page. Examples would be bidding and construction.</dd>
<dd>The one point where I am in absolute agreement, is the need for each country tp have a page devoted to their ENTIRE Summer Olympic history and then another page for their history in the Winter Olympics as well. These pages are/will be invaluable.<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerakhantu_3ed3.html" title="User:Perakhantu">Perakhantu</a> 06:24, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it would be extremely useful to have at least this level of detail for all sports, for all Games.</dd>
<dd>As for the location of the medal table, I'm not extremely insistent about the location. Putting it in the infobox is an interesting idea. (The implementation might be difficult - passing a table as a template parameter is not easy.) Like I said, I had felt that the order of sections as 1. sports, 2. participating nations, 3. medal table was the most logical, but I won't fight it.</dd>
<dd>Lastly, I'd like to discuss the "Nation at the Olympics" pages. Currently, the plan seems to be to have two summary pages for most nations, one each for summer &amp; winter Games. I had been planning to bring up a proposal on the WikiProject page to only have a single summary page. Some of the material that ought to be included (such as discussion about the NOC for each nation) would otherwise be duplicated if there were two high-level pages. For "big" nation histories (e.g. USA), this will undoubtedly have to be split into multiple sub-articles, and the Summer/Winter split is a start. (I would think that a properly written article on the USA might need even more than that, such as a sport-by-sport breakdown. I can imagine that "United States at the Olympics - Athletics" might be a fairly complete article by itself.)</dd>
<dd>My motivation for this "merger" is that it is <i>far simpler</i> for most nations to have a single "home page" for their Olympic history, and it aligns well with the new infobox style I'm adopting for the specific "Nation at the year Olympics" pages, where I include the full set of Olympic appearances. I'd appreciate your comments on this idea, as the current state of the summary pages is quite woeful, and I'd like to have support for a common format before I tackle them. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrwsc_0d9e.html" title="User:Andrwsc">Andrwsc</a> 17:28, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>IF you have <i>extremely</i> brief summary of each sport, that wouldn't be too bad I suppose. I just don't want to make the recent olympic pages larger than they already are. I mean, 2004 is quite large, and I can only imagine what the 2008 page would be.</dd>
<dd>As for the medal tables/infobox idea, I have also noticed that boxes change is size (horizontal) from olympiad to olympiad. The pictures seem to vary is size thus causing the boxes to fluctuate. I myself am NOT that competent in wikipedia formatting, but do you know of a way to keep the images the same size? I myself would like to see how a medal table would look when combined with the info box. I know you are busy, so this isn't urgent at all.</dd>
<dd>With the Nation pages, I agree that for many countries, having one page (combining both summer and winter olympic histories) would be sufficent. But here is the question: Where do you draw the line when to have the pages split into 2 (summer/winter) and then split again into sport-by-sport pages? Just bringing up an issue that one should be mindful of.</dd>
<dd>I personally think that the template or infobox or whatever it is that you created for each country at XXXX Olympics is really good. Large flag, with IOC designation and then the years participated in. Very nice.</dd>
<dd>Having thought about all this, it really makes me wonder how complete all these olympic pages are. I mean.. I think we have maybe 10% done.. if that? The way this is all unfolding, there are scads and scads of information that still needs to be added to all these pages. What a daunting task.</dd>

<dd>As for the "Nation at the Olympics" pages, I think the rule of thumb ought to be to split when you start to see the "page is too big" message! Seriously, I don't think we need a "one size fits all" rule for every page. Even as it stands now, some of the <i>individual Games pages</i> are way too big and ought to be split (<a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_at_the_2004_Summer_Olympics_ad88.html" title="United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics">United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada_at_the_2006_Winter_Olympics_6831.html" title="Canada at the 2006 Winter Olympics">Canada at the 2006 Winter Olympics</a>, etc.)</dd>
<dd>Thanks for the feedback on the new nation infoboxes. Considering I've put that onto a couple of hundred pages so far, I'm surprised that nobody has commented on it. Things sure seem to be quiet in the Olympic WikiProject these days.</dd>
<dd>As for the scope of the whole project, I agree there is a <b>HUGE</b> amount of work to be done, if we want to get everything brought up to the same level. My opinion is that if we can get every "Sport at the year Olympics" page to show the complete list of medal winners (in the same format) and ditto for the "Nation at the year Olympics" pages, then that's a fantastic milestone. Adding the complete results for every athlete in every event is an awesome goal, but comes second. One of my goals is to get the complete 2004 results cleaned up so that they become the template for 2008. Every two years we seem to attract a large group of editors who focus on the Games for a couple of weeks, then move on to something else. It would be great if the 2004 pages were a gold standard they could start with. Take a look at how I've re-formatted the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canoeing_at_the_2004_Summer_Olympics_9d16.html" title="Canoeing at the 2004 Summer Olympics">Canoeing at the 2004 Summer Olympics</a> page into specific event pages to see what I mean.

<p>The old behavior was to collapse of <i>more than one</i> (NavFrame/dynamic) navigation box was present, and the current is to collapse if more than <i>two</i> (.navbox) navigation boxes are present. I think two navigation boxes don't take up enough space to warrant collapsing them. The number of boxes that need to be present before they are autocollapsed can easily be in-/decreased if people wish this, though.

<dd>I already though of that: an navigation box will <i>always</i> be collapsed if it has the <code>.collapsed</code> class. I'll add an extra parameter to {{<a href="../../../d/y/n/Template%7EDynamic_navigation_box_7f5b.html" title="Template:Dynamic navigation box">Dynamic navigation box</a>}} <i>et al.</i> Regarding the font size: I viewed this page on IE6 and the font size is slightly (very slight) smaller than the other text. A font size of 90% just doesn't seem to make such an impact on IE6 (this is true for other interface elements with a font size of 90% as well). It may well be possible that if you have set your default font size to anything below normal/medium there isn't any difference. —<i><a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._Koot_c978.html" title="User:R.

<dd>I agree, but a stub is better than a redlink. My current project is to make sure all of the "<i>Nation</i> at the <i>year</i> Olympics" articles are created (at least to stub level) and all have the new infobox to show the flag, medal count, and list of all appearances. This project involves me editing about <b>3000 articles</b>. That's a big enough job as it is; to actually <i>COMPLETE</i> each page by going through all the Olympic reports and pulling out all the athlete information is an absolutely <b>ENORMOUS</b> task. Think about it - there are thousands of athletes for each Games! We're just scratching the surface with the Olympics Wikiproject; my current work is to get the framework in place in a consistent, clear format. By putting the references link on every stub, I am hoping that some other editors will help fill in the details. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrwsc_0d9e.html" title="User:Andrwsc">Andrwsc</a> 22:37, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah, ok, will do. I view the whole "mixed team" idea as the IOC's solution to the "accounting problem" of how to handle medal counts.

<p>I wasn't the one who made the orginal edit, but having a boarder around the "Japan flag" icon is a good idea. All you see is a red dot. Yu think you could change the template accordingly?

<dd>I'm not sure what that editor's intentions were. The subtlety of a 7:10 vs. 7:10.5 aspect ratio is completely lost in a 22x20px icon.

<dd>For what it's worth, I think the border definitely makes the flag look better and should probably be added to the template. Other flags with a predominantly white field (e.g. Chinese Taipei, Cyprus) have similar borders, so there is precedent. Aesthetically, the border used on the Chinese Taipei flag is a bit more subtle and I think would look better on the Japan flag (and on Cyprus, for that matter). Of course, I'm next to useless at editing graphics files, so I'm not going to be able to do anything about it myself.&#160;:) <a href="../../../e/r/o/User%7EEronMain_e7ee.html" title="User:EronMain">Eron</a> 13:09, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hey. I've used Inkscape to convert the PNG files to SVG - and it did lower the file size - but when i uploaded to Commons the image didn't appear at all. It also didn't show an Inkscape special bar that appeared below other visible working SVG images. I believed that you can convert PNG to SVG, but you <b>CAN'T</b> transform a <b>raster</b> format (PNG) into a <b>vectorial</b> graphic (vectors can't appear from thin air). This can explain why i can't visualize the images on Wikipedia. For them to be SVG i'd have to create them again on Inkscape (oh patience!). Anyway, as of now i have all Summer sports pictograms (even lacrosse, roquet, tug-of-war...) with their new names (<i>Olympic pictogram XXXX</i>) but i'm gonna upload them <b>under PNG format</b> and wait until i have patience to redo them on SVG or someone does it for me. <b><a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParutakupiu_900a.html" title="User:Parutakupiu"><font>Parutakupiu</font></a></b> <sup><a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParutakupiu_59e9.html" title="User talk:Parutakupiu"><font color="#C00000">talk</font></a> || <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Parutakupiu_6f0f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Parutakupiu"><font color="#008000">contribs</font></a></sup> 17:32, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Jonel, welcome back. I noticed in your new pages that you put extra spacing around the NOC name when you use the flagIOCxxx templates. Is that intentional? The effect is to render the IOC code with spacing between it and the parenthesis, plus put an extra space (in addition to the nbsp from the template) between the name and the flag For example:</p>

<p>Hi again. Before you create many more pages in 1964 canoeing, might I request that you take a look at what I did for the 2004 pages? (for example: <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canoeing_at_the_2004_Summer_Olympics_-_Men%27s_C-1_1000_metres_ff1e.html" title="Canoeing at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Men's C-1 1000 metres">Canoeing at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Men's C-1 1000 metres</a>). To be honest, I have trouble with your event page format. I find the colors very distracting, especially since they span the whole line and often the whole table. <a href="../../../w/a/i/WP%7EWAI_56c8.html" title="WP:WAI">WP:WAI</a> suggests using color sparingly. Also, the tables for multiple heats don't line up together. On the 2004 page, I use a table to get alignment across multiple races, but I don't display the table lines. The result is quite clean, in my opinion (but then again, I could be accused of "not invented here syndrome"). I'm just suggesting you consider that format. Thanks, <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrwsc_0d9e.html" title="User:Andrwsc">Andrwsc</a> 00:54, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sure, no problem. I've started to care less and less about format--coming to the realization that what I like in a results display doesn't seem to match very well what most other people like. Also, the style seems to undergo a massive alteration at least every two years... only 625 or so more days to go before the next big crush of new editors with their own tastes. I'll stick to data, that tends to last longer (even accounting for things like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Megan_Hall&amp;diff=89267181&amp;oldid=38232300" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Megan_Hall&amp;diff=89267181&amp;oldid=38232300" rel="nofollow">this diff</a>). Feel free to make any changes, I'll try to catch on and keep new pages in whatever the most modern style is. -- <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonel_e850.html" title="User:Jonel">Jonel</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJonel_1c2e.html" title="User talk:Jonel">Speak</a> 03:15, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here's a working example of the template you made on your page. It is <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_at_the_2004_Summer_Olympics_ad88.html" title="United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics">United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics</a> using an <a href="../../../j/p/0/User%7EJP06035_Test-template_38dc.html" title="User:JP06035/Test-template">altered version of your template</a>. Instead of having to type in the <tt>&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</tt> yourself at the end, I just added it to the beginning of the template. There is hardly a time that this would cause a problem, except for the odd chance that someone has an opened <tt>&lt;div&gt;</tt> tag at the beginning of the page, which shouldn't be there in the first place. So I think this'll work.</p>
<p>Also, I used <tt>__NOEDITSECTION__</tt> in the template, but that makes so that the whole page has no edit sections.

<dd>I might have to deal with the javascript classes to figure out the solution, but what I'd like to see is the "[edit]" button over on the right, as usual, but have the "[show]/[hide]" right after the heading name, just like the way the TOC box is usually rendered. I think it is essential to have section editing enabled here before we go "live" with the new templates. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrwsc_0d9e.html" title="User:Andrwsc">Andrwsc</a> 19:20, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If i am allowed to make suggestions, i'd suggest - if possible! - to incorporate the show/hide function in the header title. It would be much easier to "open" the results, clicking directly on the sport name than trying to guess which "[show]" belongs to which sport (really, one almost has to draw a line to figure it out). In this way, the edit link could occupy the rightmost place.

The closest thing I've got now is at <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrwsc_Test_7e71.html" title="User:Andrwsc/Test">User:Andrwsc/Test</a>, where the edit and show are on subsequent lines. That produces some extra whitespace in the article, which doesn't look great, but at least you get both edit and hide/show buttons to appear without interfering. I do believe the horizontal line helps, which is one reason why I put the section heading at level 2 instead of 3. To be honest, I'm not sure that the "Results by event" heading adds a lot of value. I think those articles ought to have "Medals", the list of sports, and "References" all at the same level. The next section level could be for men/women, by sport discipline, etc. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrwsc_0d9e.html" title="User:Andrwsc">Andrwsc</a> 19:50, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've got something that might be workable. (User:Andrwsc/Test) I had to split the template into two parts, one for the pictogram rendering and another for the section wrapper. (We'd probably want to wrap the div/div stuff into a "section end" template too.) That puts the edit button and the hide/show button on different lines. At first glance, not using a single template might look inelegant, but there are some benefits. First, on pages where a nation only has a handful of athletes, we can still use the pictogram header but it would be overkill to use the hide/show sections. Second, it provides an opportunity for some narrative text to appear <i>outside</i> of the hidden results section. This might be good for a casual reader scanning the article without having to hit show/hide on each section.

<p>I fail to see the problem with that medal board, especially when it is conveying information that isn't anywhere else in the article. Removing two pieces of information so that two other pieces don't appear twice (in two separate boards) does not seem ideal to me.<br />
And more poignantly, you claimed in your edit summary a standard in +3000 articles. Although that format is indeed repeated across a large number of articles, the history pages show (the articles' and yours) that you are yourself the creator of that standard. The thing is, you don't get to create a Wikipedia "standard" by "mass editing" (that's not the best expression, I know, see ahead) yourself. And let me pause here, since I do realize that the expression "mass editing" carries (or can carry) a derrogatory meaning, and that's not what I mean at all: you've been doing a very good work to expand Wikipedia's coverage of Olympic sport. But I'm sure you will understand the...difficulty in claiming a "standard" that you created yourself, apparently without community discussion (and again, that's not to say that your edits were in any way bad).<br />
Considering what I said about this particular article — that the board conveys information that is not found anywhere else in the article — which I exposed in <i>my</i> edit summary, the correct course of action would have been to start a thread on the article's talk page, or since I was the author, at least on my talk page, and try to reach some kind of compromise about the information that is being excluded by removing the board.<br />
At this point, per what I have said, I see no community consensus that would invalidate the presence of that board in the "Medals" section, although I don't really have any problems with finding some other place in the article to include the information in question. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 00:35, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There was lots of discussion about the article format with respect to medal tables etc. Look in the Olympics WikiProject archives. I just happened to be the editor to implement that on the thousands of Olympic articles, but that doesn't mean I'm the only person who wants it that way.</dd>
<dd>In any case, the information in that little box was redundant to the main infobox. Medal counts and ranking is all included there - what else were you trying to convey? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrwsc_0d9e.html" title="User:Andrwsc">Andrwsc</a> 00:40, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Additionally, your table includes the Olympic rings as a decoration, and we have been diligently trying to remove them from these pages as that usage is a fair-use violation. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrwsc_0d9e.html" title="User:Andrwsc">Andrwsc</a> 00:42, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The old table (incidentally, the rings were inserted by another user, removed by a third user, then re-inserted by yet another user...a neverending circle of which I stayed clear) was conveying two ranks: one was the official rank by gold medal (and having the others as "tie-breakers"), and the other was the somewhat popular rank by sheer number of medals, none of which are displayed on the board at the moment. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 02:51, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Um, take another look. The "rank=" parameter to the infobox displays the rank immediately next to the medal counts. I added Brazil's rank of 16th with my most recent edit. As for having two ranks, well, that issue was debated to death after the 2004 Games and re-opened after the 2006 Games, and the consensus was that all the Wikipedia pages should <b>only</b> use the same ranking as used (unofficially) by the IOC. Take a look at the "disclaimer" at the start of all the medal count articles such as <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_Summer_Olympics_medal_count_1f89.html" title="2004 Summer Olympics medal count">2004 Summer Olympics medal count</a>. If you <i>really</i> feel strongly that this article needs mention of the other ranking, then it ought to be in the prose text of that section. Having that little table is totally superfluous. There is NO good reason why this article should be different from every other Olympic article. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrwsc_0d9e.html" title="User:Andrwsc">Andrwsc</a> 02:59, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>I could have swarn that that rank was not there (on the board, that is)...then again, I had been looking at other countries' boards as well, so maybe it was missing in one of them. Ok, that solves it for the "almost official" rank&#160;:).<br />
Yes, I remember there being a discussion over whether or not to use the other ranking (I believe it started when someone created an article for that ranking — or maybe it was an extra column on the board of the "main" article) back when the 2004 Games were ongoing. I didn't recall it being reopened by the 2006 Winter Games though. Very well, tomorrow I'll try to figure out a way to work that into the text of the article.<br />
A couple of points though: 1) Although it helps that we have certain standardized features (such as an infobox at the top of each article), we needn't strive for articles that are mostly standardized. The fact that one (or some of the) article(s) may feature something that isn't used in any other article doesn't mean that we need to either lose that different thing or only keep it if it's incorporated into every other article. That procedure can at times cost us content, quality, etc.; 2) I noticed that you created one infobox for each country (at [[Template:Infobox Olympics {{country}}]]), normally we try to create a single template, incorporating what we've come to call "exoteric code" (humorous jargon for seemingly complicated wiki code) that allows for the template to adjust to any related subject by filling out one parameter. The current templates are only using it for specific information for each edition of the Games for each country, but considering that the names of the articles are standardized, and so are (most) of the files for the national flags, it should be possible to replace those with a single template, wherein filling out a parameter line with the country's name would cause all the links to point to <i>(that country)</i> at the X Games, the corresponding national flag, etc. It would be a much wiser use of space, and a simplification of process, to replace +150 templates (I'd assume, since it's roughly one per country in the Olympics) with one, adaptable template. Unless you guys had some reason I don't know of for opting for individual templates for each country. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 05:34, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Um, please take another look at the implementation of those infoboxes. I <b>did</b> create a single {{<a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_Country_Olympics_a7f4.html" title="Template:Infobox Country Olympics">Infobox Country Olympics</a>}} to handle all the visual appearance and "esoteric stuff". Obviously, that makes it easy to make a single edit to alter certain things. (For example, the "rank=" parameter was added later, which is why it doesn't appear on all the pages yet.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, the "second level" templates (one per nation, such as {{<a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_Olympics_Brazil_325b.html" title="Template:Infobox Olympics Brazil">Infobox Olympics Brazil</a>}} contain items that would otherwise be duplicated for every instance of the infobox, such as the links to the NOC article and website, and the lists of appearances. This makes it easy to add the link to 2008, for example, in a single spot instead of possibly dozens of articles.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Trust me, these templates are well-thought out. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrwsc_0d9e.html" title="User:Andrwsc">Andrwsc</a> 06:52, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

On a completely unrelated note (or maybe sort of), I just noticed we don't have a single event-specific entry for the Swimming events in the 2000 Summer Games (Sydney, Australia), "only" the more general entry with the medalists.

For the mean time, i'll wikilink the main article for each year (e.g. appearance of CHN in 1951 will be linked to <a href="../../../1/9/5/1951_Asian_Games_bd31.html" title="1951 Asian Games">1951 Asian Games</a>).

<dd>Yeah, I don't think you want a long list of redlinks for each country because the full set of "Nation at the xxxx Asian Games" articles don't exist.

<dd>Because MAC is not an IOC country code. Macau has never competed as a team at the Olympic Games, and there is no National Olympic Committee (NOC) for Macau, so there is no country code.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">translating some olympic sport templates in other languages</span></h2>
<p>Hi Andrwsc, This is a help request related with one of the templates you've worked in, the olympic flags one.</p>
<p>I copied a few of the english Wikipedia <a href="../../../f/l/a/Template%7EFlagIOC_5e63.html" title="Template:FlagIOC">FlagIOC</a> and related country templates, to the <a href="../../../../pt/p/%C3%A1/g/P%C3%A1gina_principal.html" class="extiw" title="pt:Página_principal">portuguese language wikipedia</a> (where my username is Alexg, not the same as in here).</p>
<p>The goal is to use them in medal tables or other lists of participating countries in the Olympic Games, being able to just copy the tables from the english version, with automatic adaptation.</p>
<p>However, the same structure when applied in the portuguese language wikipedia, did not work as it should, because only the most recent flag of a country appears.</p>
<p>And the contents of the several templates are the same in both languages, except that in portuguese I've not included link generation for links as "Greece at the 1996 Summer Olympics" - and thus the template text is a bit shorter.</p>
<p>As a test, I've tried to work with the greek flag because it's a good example of a flag change.</p>
<p>I have:</p>
<p>in portuguese ("Predefinição" is the word for "template")</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../../pt/f/l/a/Predefini%C3%A7%C3%A3o%7EFlagIOC_39e5.html" class="extiw" title="pt:Predefinição:FlagIOC">pt:Predefinição:FlagIOC</a> -</li>

</ul>
<p>When I write in a portuguese page:</p>
<pre>
{{flagIOC|GRE|1896 Summer}}
</pre>
<p>the result is <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Greece.svg_eda2.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/5/5c/Flag_of_Greece.svg/20px-Flag_of_Greece.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Greece.svg_eda2.html" /></a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greece</a> (except the name of the country which is in portuguese, and correct)</p>
<p>but it should be: <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Greece_%281828-1978%29.svg_418b.html" class="image" title="Greece"><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/e/e6/Flag_of_Greece_%281828-1978%29.svg/22px-Flag_of_Greece_%281828-1978%29.svg.png" alt="Greece" width="22" height="15" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Greece_%281828-1978%29.svg_418b.html" /></a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece_at_the_1896_Summer_Olympics_50e8.html" title="Greece at the 1896 Summer Olympics">Greece</a></p>
<p>Any ideas? Thanks for the help,</p>

<dd>Take a look now. You need to pass the "1896 Summer" argument to the country_flag_IOC_alias_GRE template for that switch to work. I would also suggest that you change to Portuguese. In English, the template works because all of the articles we have are of the form "<i>Nation</i> at the <i>year</i> Olympics". The <i>Nation</i> part comes from the Country_IOC_alias_xxx template and the <i>year</i> part comes from the second parameter to the flagIOC template. The "at the" and "Olympics" strings are hard-coded into the flagIOC template. I don't know what the translation to Portuguese would look like, but you need to follow a similar structure and make edits to the <a href="../../../../pt/f/l/a/Predefini%C3%A7%C3%A3o%7EFlagIOC_39e5.html" class="extiw" title="pt:Predefinição:FlagIOC">pt:Predefinição:FlagIOC</a> and <a href="../../../../pt/c/o/u/Predefini%C3%A7%C3%A3o%7ECountry_flag_IOC_alias_GRE_5cf7.html" class="extiw" title="pt:Predefinição:Country_flag_IOC_alias_GRE">pt:Predefinição:Country flag IOC alias GRE</a> templates appropriately. For example, if your articles all have the same naming style as <a href="../../../../pt/b/r/a/Brasil_nos_Jogos_Ol%C3%ADmpicos_de_Inverno_de_2006_0784.html" class="extiw" title="pt:Brasil_nos_Jogos_Olímpicos_de_Inverno_de_2006">pt:Brasil nos Jogos Olímpicos de Inverno de 2006</a>, then I think you want "Inverno de 2006" to be the parameter you pass to your version of flagIOC and "nos Jogos Olímpicos de" would be hard-coded into your flagIOC as well.

<p>Andrwsc, do you think this article is really necessary? The sport per-year template shows it as not included on the Olympics' programme, but if we get to use the {{<a href="../../../o/l/y/Template%7EOlympicYearHeader_b5da.html" title="Template:OlympicYearHeader">OlympicYearHeader</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../o/l/y/Template%7EOlympicYearFooter_9b7b.html" title="Template:OlympicYearFooter">OlympicYearFooter</a>}}, it will show an active link because this article exists, misleading the casual reader. <b><a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParutakupiu_900a.html" title="User:Parutakupiu"><font color="#008080">Parutakupiu</font></a></b> <sup><a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParutakupiu_59e9.html" title="User talk:Parutakupiu"><font color="#C00000">talk</font></a> || <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Parutakupiu_6f0f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Parutakupiu"><font color="#008000">contribs</font></a></sup> 20:16, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Parutakupiu, there's no "disturbance"! Sorry for not replying on the WikiProject page - sometimes I have an immediate opinion on a topic and I will reply quickly, and sometimes I need to think about something, so I take some time.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In this case, I guess I'm not sure about your proposal. The templates certainly look good, so there's no issue there, but I'm weighing the pros and cons of another set of navigation boxes. I think there are instances on Wikipedia where proper use of categories and list pages are probably sufficient to navigate a topic, and other places where navigation boxes really are desired. For example, many athlete pages have an <i>excessive</i> use of navigation boxes, in my opinion. Take a look at <a href="../../../t/o/n/Toni_Sailer_2caf.html" title="Toni Sailer">Toni Sailer</a>, for example. At least those five navigation boxes now utilize the show/hide feature - that page was very cluttered before. Even so, I'm not sure that it is a <i>natural</i> way for readers to want to navigate through Wikipedia. Do we really need a navigation box to go from one winner in a specific event at the world championships to the next? Wouldn't it be just as easy to have a "See also" section with links to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Olympic_medalists_in_alpine_skiing_c7d5.html" title="List of Olympic medalists in alpine skiing">List of Olympic medalists in alpine skiing</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Alpine_Skiing_World_Champions_5f57.html" title="List of Alpine Skiing World Champions">List of Alpine Skiing World Champions</a> and navigate from there?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It's not exactly a parallel situation, but perhaps the concept is similar -- the question to be answered is do we <i>really</i> need this new set of navigation boxes (which will number around 350-400 if we make them for all events) or are a set of categories and the existing medalist lists sufficient? I currently don't have a solid opinion on this myself, so I haven't offered one in response to your request on the WikiProject page. However, if you have a logical position to support whichever path you take, and can lay the foundation for a consistent implementation across <b>all</b> events (not just diving), then I would support you either way. Consistency is my biggest concern here. Hope this helps, <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrwsc_0d9e.html" title="User:Andrwsc">Andrwsc</a> 07:21, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Come to think of it, now that you mentioned the categories, these pages already do have an "Event at the Olympics"-style category which lists all pages about that event throughout the Olympics. I only thought about such templates because these diving events' pages only have the upper-right "<i>Sport</i> events at the <i>year</i> Summer Olympics" navigation box and none at the bottom. But then again, many top-level sport articles show a "<i>Sport</i> at the Summer Olympics" navigation box along with a similar grouping category.

Volleyball is mentioned as one of the "children's games" demonstrated ("Jeux de l’enfance" on page 91).

<dd>Hi Chris, I am not an admin, and I have no idea how to effectively appeal to SndrAndrss! He/she simply refuses to understand how to use talk pages (both in article space and user space) to communicate with other editors, nor how to use edit summaries. I am at a loss too. I don't know what the process here is, but if you need me to "testify" to an admin, let me know, and I can describe the disruption he/she has caused to the pages that I have been working on. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrwsc_0d9e.html" title="User:Andrwsc">Andrwsc</a> 19:56, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was wondering if I should request or not... It would certainly help if I didn't nominate myself, and I am honored that you would offer to nominate me, thanks!!

You are probably going to face criticism that most of your work has been in sports related (specifically Olympics, but I know that you've done a lot of other things on other sport pages) pages and that you don't have a broad enough focus on other topics. Also, most of the work we do on the Olympics stuff is only with a small handful of other edits so it's not like we're dealing with edit wars all the time. I would make sure in your questions that you highlight all of the work that you've done on templates and other information to really clean-up the Olympics pages and make things more standard. I would focus on why you want / need the tools to accomplish work that you've already been doing. I don't know if you tend to follow a lot of the athletes / living people bios on your watchlist, but if you do I would also highlight that to show how useful something like the rollback tool would be. You can take a look at my closed RfA (it's under Sreed1234 - not Sue Anne) to see how I responded to some of the criticism. --<a href="../../../s/u/e/User%7ESue_Anne_8203.html" title="User:Sue Anne">Sue Anne</a> 18:56, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well. I for one nominated myself. And I passed on the second try. Some (rare, I believe) people even prefer self noms. The benefit of a self nom is you can write your nomination yourself and you are in control of the exact timing (which is sometimes important...). Also a self nom is not colored by dislikes for the nominator (people that dislike me might oppose you if I'm your nominator, beware! :-). I was in a thick dispute (<a href="../../../a/u/m/WP%7EAUM_b93f.html" title="WP:AUM">WP:AUM</a>) before I got the mop. But since then, I've not been in any dispute (maybe I try to stay out of things like <a href="../../../a/u/m/WP%7EAUM_b93f.html" title="WP:AUM">WP:AUM</a> now, in order not to loose my admin bit :-). I'm certainly not a typical admin - but who is? I'm not sure I would pass again, as I'm only a template fiddler (no article writer). What especially impresses me about you is your calm and detail-caring style and you are good in describing complex matters and discussing them. The RfA process is a pain, but it's best to consider it as "no big deal" and humbly accept whatever comes out without big emotions and continue to do good work even if you fail. In fact, it is somewhat a waste of time on all sides (going through RfA), but that's the best process we currently have on this wiki and the project has been quite successful with that. Whatever you decide, you do have my support either way. Now or anytime.<br />
Two minor recommendations: (1) never ever withdraw your RfA once the process has started, (2) do activate the wiki-email feature so that people can email you (this increases your chances because people do like to send emails in private occasionally – also, blocked users can't post to your talk page). --<a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELigulem_20b6.html" title="User:Ligulem">Ligulem</a> 18:03, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ok. I whipped up your RfA page at User:Ligulem/work/Andrwsc. Feedback/suggestions/corrections are welcome.

<dd>I would like to apologize for starting that RfA under my userspace. Not very well thought out by me <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_adminship%2FAndrwsc&amp;diff=109921876&amp;oldid=109918049" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_adminship%2FAndrwsc&amp;diff=109921876&amp;oldid=109918049" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>. I could swear this worked better in the past. The original idea once was to lighten the psychological pressure a bit and not having a page lingering at the "official" location in case the candidate decides not to run the RfA <i>after</i> having read the nomination statement. Sigh. --<a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELigulem_20b6.html" title="User:Ligulem">Ligulem</a> 00:08, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Nobody can tell what's in a nominee's head. The one thing I do know is that nobody with so few policy-oriented projectspace edits could possibly be familiar enough with the process, which is what adminship primarily entails. When I supportna RfA, I declare that I trust this person to apply the deletion, blocking, and and protection policies correctly, and in my experience nobody with only 133 projectspace edits could have possibly developed such expertise. - <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETragic_Baboon_8a4d.html" title="User:Tragic Baboon">Tragic Baboon</a> <small>(<a href="../../../t/r/a/User_talk%7ETragic_Baboon_9011.html" title="User talk:Tragic Baboon">banana receptacle</a>)</small> 01:49, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think you are wrong about me, but the only way to demonstrate that is for you to look through my edit history.

<p>Hey there! I was just going through The 2004 sport pages and saw that a while ago you have added <a href="../../../w/e/i/Weightlifting_at_the_2004_Summer_Olympics_20b4.html#Participating_nations" title="Weightlifting at the 2004 Summer Olympics">the participating nations section to Weightlifting at the 2004 Summer Olympics</a>. There are certainly a lot of nations there, so I was wondering where you got your stuff. When I did even a small one for the archery thing, I sorted through the links on WP (and cross-checked them with some BBC site, of course) to come up with my list but it took forever. I was hoping you had somewhere where all the participants for each event by nation or something like that is posted.</p>
<p>I made a post on <a href="../../../o/l/y/WT%7EOLYMPICS_5021.html" title="WT:OLYMPICS">WT:OLYMPICS</a> about medal tables, if you wanted to look at it.</p>
<p>I also saw that you were nominated for adminship, and I voted with Olympic support! <sub>└</sub><sup><b><a href="../../../j/p/0/User%7EJP06035_fdfe.html" title="User:JP06035"><font color="#0084C9">Jared</font></a></b></sup><sub>┘</sub><sup>┌</sup><sub><i><a href="../../../j/p/0/User_talk%7EJP06035_4c31.html" title="User talk:JP06035"><font color="#009E49">talk</font></a></i></sub><sup>┐</sup>  19:41, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your support!! As for the participating nations for 2004 weightlifting, I tabulated that by hand from the set of individual results pages. A bit tedious, as you have discovered for archery. I use Excel a <b>lot</b> for editing these sorts of things, so my process was to copy &amp; paste the results tables from each event page into a spreadsheet then sum up the totals by country code. I know that some past Games reports have included number of competitors by sport, so it would be a lot easier to update those pages! <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrwsc_0d9e.html" title="User:Andrwsc">Andrwsc</a> 19:51, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, I did the same thing with excel. Once I get going, I'll have excel open for laying out tables, Word open for quickly doing some replacements to certain text, and AWB open for doing massive changes. It's annoying, but it gets the job done faster than "by hand." The problem with some events though may be that some people compete in two events, so using that method they'd be counted twice. To bypass that, all we'd have to do is just sort the list of people and NOCs and delete the doubles. <sub>└</sub><sup><b><a href="../../../j/p/0/User%7EJP06035_fdfe.html" title="User:JP06035"><font color="#0084C9">Jared</font></a></b></sup><sub>┘</sub><sup>┌</sup><sub><i><a href="../../../j/p/0/User_talk%7EJP06035_4c31.html" title="User talk:JP06035"><font color="#009E49">talk</font></a></i></sub><sup>┐</sup>  19:59, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would encourage you, if you're not already, to make sure to double check your information from some official source and not just rely on what may or may not be on another individual Olympic page. I'm adding / reformatting all the Country at 2006 Winter Olympics pages right now, and I had found a handful of errors, so I'm just going strictly by the main resource vs. relying what someone may have added to the page. --<a href="../../../s/u/e/User%7ESue_Anne_8203.html" title="User:Sue Anne">Sue Anne</a> 20:11, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
