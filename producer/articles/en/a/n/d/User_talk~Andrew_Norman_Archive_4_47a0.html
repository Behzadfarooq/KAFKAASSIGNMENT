<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I caught <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBormalagurski_75a9.html" title="User:Bormalagurski">Boris Malagurski</a> red-handed while disrupting wikipedia, and now he is trying to delete my comment that proves what he did. I don't know if he can do this.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p><a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">user:Dado</a> has created some new Bosnia locator maps, but without entities marked (except badly visible inter-entity line). I think this is a bad idea, so I created my own maps, with separate colors for each entity (we have that already, but those maps are in low resolution and small).</p>
<p>I couldn't reach a compromise with Dado, and I believe we need third opinion.</p>

<p>Foking is in cases an acceptable maner to divide content that does not fit in a certain category. An accepted name encompassing the entire spectrum of information was found but was brutely and unjustifiably reverted and created a situation when 90% of the information contained in the original article is off-topic and has no place in it. One solution exist and involves addering to the naming conventions and using the next level of administration, the region, the encompass all buildings contained within it. It is also important to have a certain knowledge of the area which I believe the admin <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">User:ALoan</a> does not possess did not permit him/her to act appropriate safe in the knowledge that his change was accurate. <b><a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_scarlet_6377.html" title="User:Captain scarlet"><font color="#000000">Captain Scarlet</font></a></b> <i><a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptain_scarlet_567e.html" title="User talk:Captain scarlet"><font color="#FF0000">and the Mysterons</font></a></i> 16:28, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The article's header itself contradict its name. The title is <i>in Paris</i> whilst the header speaks of a <i>metropolitan</i> area. A term not used in French nor is present in <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28places%29_59d5.html#Follow_local_conventions" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (places)">Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_(places)#Follow_local_conventions</a>.</dd>
<dd>An easy example is Courbevoie. A building in Courbevoie (see the table) is in Courbevoire, not Paris. If it were in Paris, it'd be in Paris, not Courbevoie. You can do that with all of the other buildings mentioned as not being in Paris but in an other municipality.

<p>Andrew, no matter the actions taken, this article is on the wrong side of fact, and if you'd take a few minutes to verify, or ask both parties to provide reference backing their claims, you'd see this soon enough for yourself. Everything between here and then is just a waste of time, and we are more than a few to know it - this does not pardon the revert silliness, but can explain a large part of the motivation behind it. What you have here is a (series of) low-traffic article(s), since long under the heel of one, finally getting factual attention now that Wiki is growing. The only acceptable "appropriation" of any article should be by the verifiability and comprehensibility of the fact it contains, not the unreferencable opinions of a few (in this case, two) contributors. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThePromenader_3b0e.html" title="User:ThePromenader"><span style="font-family: Times; font-size:12px;"><span style="font-size:16px;">T</span>HE<span style="font-size:16px;">P</span>ROMENADER</span></a> 21:18, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>...and I might add that a week-long block against <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_scarlet_6377.html" title="User:Captain scarlet">User: Captain scarlet</a> is a bit much. This story with the 'opposing' contributor in question is not new, and a veracity check - or even demand - would quickly make reasons for frustration apparent. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThePromenader_3b0e.html" title="User:ThePromenader"><span style="font-family: Times; font-size:12px;"><span style="font-size:16px;">T</span>HE<span style="font-size:16px;">P</span>ROMENADER</span></a> 22:00, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

Despite being told by two users already (<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan_239f.html" title="User:Metropolitan">User:Metropolitan</a> and I) that the sentence is perfectly fine and should stay in the introduction, he has repeatedly deleted the sentence for the same mindless literalism that you have already witnessed.

<p>I would like to alert you to a problem regarding this user and his block log. You may remember that he was initially blocked for a full month (after a series of shorter blocks) for blatant, repeated incivility. After discovering that he was using a sock puppet to get around this block, you told him that you were going to block him for an additional month, but according to his block log, THIS BLOCK WAS NEVER ACTIVATED--it is not listed at all. Since today is the day his original month-long block expires, I feel you should look into this. Thank you very much. 71.101.224.144 14:07, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I noted his vandalism in the Slovenians page where I was disturbed by the false figures for Slovenians in Italy and Austria. There are considerable Slovenian minorities living in those two countries and the anon user was constantly distorting the figures. For example, he attempted to claim that there are only some 2300 Slovenians living in Italy, while the figure is in fact around 90,000. See this article by a Slovenian ethnographer for more details: <a href="http://www.zrc-sazu.si/ZGDS/glasgow/16.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.zrc-sazu.si/ZGDS/glasgow/16.pdf" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>. The anon user was removing sourced figures for these two countries. His comment on the talk page of 11 May 2006 was completely nonsensical and was merely an attempt to justify these misrepresentations.</p>
<p>I am not going to waste my time discussing nonsense with an anon user who has no other work to do than giving vent to his anti-Slavic sentiments. If you refuse my request, I'll ask a Slovenian admin to revert the page to the version of 21 July 2006.

<p>Distorting figures, writing nonsensical and misleading comments as an attempt to misrepresent and deny the existence of a strong Slovenian minority in Italy and Austria is vandalism. Moreover, he claimed I was using Ethnologue reports when I was in fact providing official population census links which he was removing. In this edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Slovenians&amp;diff=52417036&amp;oldid=51941709" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Slovenians&amp;diff=52417036&amp;oldid=51941709" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>, for example, he replaced the official Austrian census report with a disfunctional link <a href="http://www.statistik.at/pub/neuerscheinungen/vzaustriaweb.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.statistik.at/pub/neuerscheinungen/vzaustriaweb.pdf" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> and gave a figure that is more than three times smaller (7,000) than the true one (24,855). His edits were reverted by other users as well <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Slovenians&amp;diff=51941709&amp;oldid=51915954" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Slovenians&amp;diff=51941709&amp;oldid=51915954" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>.</p>
<p>I did nothing wrong by reverting vandalism and obvious nonsense. You should also bear in mind that I am the one who provided most of the current population figures and sources on the Slovenians page, as is visible from the page history. I will send to a note to a Slovenian editor who is an admin on the English wikipedia and will have a better understanding of the problem. I did not ask for the page to be unlocked. It should better remain locked to prevent further vandalism. I asked for it to be reverted to this version <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Slovenians&amp;oldid=66329414" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Slovenians&amp;oldid=66329414" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> which gives an additional source for the Italian and Argentinian figures.

<dd>The problem is a very simple one - you are refusing to discuss the matter on the article's talk page, and deleting someone else's attempts to discuss it.

<dd>The fact that you feel a Slovenian admin would be more sympathetic to your point of view speaks volumes. The problem is not that you are right or the other user is right, it is that <i>you are not discussing the matter properly</i>.

<p>I have to express my disappointment at the attitude you have taken in the 'tallest structures' debate - if anything, your involvement has helped to make what should be a very simple situation into a complicated, draw-the-line standoff that has nothing to do with fact.</p>
<p>No reference in existence takes the sort of <i>largesse</i> this article does, and no self-respecting reference would even think to try to do so, and if you'd look at any reference for the fact of the matter in this, you would see for yourself why. Wiki askes at the bottom of every edit that contributors make referenced information the standard - not general ignorance, not opinion, nor agenda, and not an ability to 'convince' other contributors into publisihing <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verifiability.html" title="Verifiability">unverifiable</a> opinion as fact. One person's 'definition' of something is very often not another's, and it is for this very reason that the Wiki standard is <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verifiability.html" title="Verifiability">verifiable fact</a>.</p>
<p>If you can provide referenced proof about the correctness of the article's present title, then you have every reason to impeach a move. If you cannot, please avoid making any such declarations because any such impeachment would be unfounded.</p>
<p>The talk page in question now explains very clearly why the title is wrong. I ask you to reconsider your position, and to make a statement to this end there confirming this, even if it is to say that you do not care one way or another. There canot be consensus on error, and the hasty and uresearched involvement of a few has done much to complicate things.</p>

<p>Thank you for your attention to the Jane Grey page and for removing the recent fictional additions. I am a historian and will soon (this fall) receive a PhD in history for a dissertation on Jane Grey. My biogrpahy of Jane Grey will be published in late 2007 or early 2008. Thus I have a special interest in the topic. One entire chapter of my dissertation/book deals specifically with the many fictional accounts of Jane's life and how those fictional accounts have come to be accepted as authentic, even by legitimate historians. Some of the edits that you "undid" do actually have a basis in history, however. For example, Jane was actually presented with the crown, though it was not called the "Crown Imperial." And she was asked to try it on. But this action was taken by the Bishop of Winchester acting as Lord Treasurer, not John Dudley, duke of Northumberland. Jane did refuse to put it on. Winchester did state that a second would be made to crown her husband Guildford, and Jane did refuse to name him king, saying she would be content to make him a duke but nothing more. The events are decribed in several manuscript sources of the period, including the diary of Thomas Hoby (British Library Egerton MSS 2148). Framlingham Castle is obvioulsy in Suffolk, not Norfolk. The confusion arises often, largely because the castle had belonged to the Duke of Norfolk prior to being given to Mary by Edward VI. But I'm sure you knew that already. The anonymous editor's addition of material concerning a letter submitted by Jane to Queen Mary, a letter in which Jane protested her innocence, is probably true. I say "probably" because accounts of the letter do not appear until 50 years later in Girolamo Pollini's "Historia Ecclesia Restaurata." In my own dissertation, I offer evidence for the authenticity of the letter. There is circumstantial evidence to suggest that Jane did indeed offer Mary her own account of events and did protest her own innocence, and that she did so in August 1553. I am not sure why you removed the sentence about Jane having been raised in the reformed religion and refusing to convert. That sentence is entirely true. Likewise, the sentence covering the execution and Jane's panic, "Where is it? What shall I do?," is also true. The words are contained in numerous original manuscript accounts from 1554, as well as in printed accounts published in the summer of 1554. The part about commending her spirit to Jesus is entirely fictional, however. I am wondering: is there a way to lock an article on Wikipedia so that unqualified people cannot add non-factual material? This article on Jane Grey (and probably many others) seems to be subject to frequent editing by people who have read some trash novel and taken that novel as fact. I do not mean to sound too full of myself, but since I am the only trained academic historian in the past century to write a biography of Jane Grey, I think I can safely say that I am the ranking expert on her. (Alison Plowden, for all her popularity, is not a trained historian. Her biography of Jane is simply a paraphrase of Richard Davey's work of 1909.) One of Wikipedia's great failings is its policy of "article by blind committee." All and sundry can create or edit articles, without qualified expert oversight. The results are sometimes quite good, but too often untrue or misleading. It would be nice if, when a qualified expert has edited a particular article, that article could be locked out, so that all further editing must pass through the identified expert on that topic before any other changes are made. That would give Wikipedia articles much greater legitimacy and put the whole enterprise on a more respectable footing than it currently enjoys. <a href="../../../p/h/d/User%7EPhD_Historian_4e3c.html" title="User:PhD Historian">PhD Historian</a> 21:34, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't have any particular expertise, my interest comes from spending a lot of time in <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bradgate_Park_ad28.html" title="Bradgate Park">Bradgate Park</a> and having hacked the article around a few months ago to make it read a little easier and to remove some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lady_Jane_Grey&amp;diff=18185681&amp;oldid=15941868" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lady_Jane_Grey&amp;diff=18185681&amp;oldid=15941868" rel="nofollow">obvious nonsense</a>. I get suspicious when an anonymous editor adds stuff that conforms to romantic stereotypes, has at least one obvious error and has no cited source. As you're well aware, historians are supposed to give references, it's not that big a deal to say where you're getting your information from (even in the edit summary, or a quick note on the talk page). I thought it better to remove the whole lot, because without references or expertise there's no way for me to validate any of it. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 08:39, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with removing obvious nonsense. In order for Wikipedia to gain credibility as a valid resource or reference, it must take measures in quality control and "fact-checking." I would rather suspicious or questionable material were removed than have erroneous material remain. It just seems to me that once an article reaches a certain point, it should be "locked" so that no nonsense can be added. So long as Wikipedia is subject to nonsense additions and vandalism, it will be very difficult for it to gain the respectablility of better known encyclopedias and references that do have control over contributions. <a href="../../../p/h/d/User%7EPhD_Historian_4e3c.html" title="User:PhD Historian">PhD Historian</a> 19:35, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

It's based on contentious edits made tonight by Promenader in the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> article. Promenader, with the same narrow-minded pedantry that you've already witnessed at <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_tallest_buildings_and_structures_in_Paris_bc5b.html" title="Talk:List of tallest buildings and structures in Paris">Talk:List of tallest buildings and structures in Paris</a>, is arguing that there was no municipality of Paris before the French Revolution, that the provost of the merchants of Paris was merely the head of a trade guild. It's a bit like arguing that the Lord Mayor of London was only the head of a trade guild and that there was no municipality of London. I brought evidence from the <i><a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclop%C3%A9die.html" title="Encyclopédie">Encyclopédie</a></i> showing the existence of the Paris municipality, but to no avail. You can see the evidence at <a href="../../../p/a/r/Talk%7EParis_8a09.html#Municipality_bis" title="Talk:Paris">Talk:Paris#Municipality bis</a>. Because I reverted Promenader's edits, I'm afraid some admin will block my account (Promenader knows how to use all the rules of Wikipedia). After double-checking, it seems there's no exception to 3RR in the case of reverting factually wrong edits (which is crazy, I think, because it favors people who add factually wrong information to articles). Anyway, I don't know what will happen, but I have little doubt that if my account is blocked Promenader will reinstate his factually wrong edits. What can be done? He edited the article and introduced this contentious issue (denying the existence of a municipality of Paris) without discussing it beforehands on the talk page. Shouldn't contentious issues like that be discussed on the talk page first, and then edit the article only if several editors agree? <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHardouin_7fc4.html" title="User:Hardouin">Hardouin</a> 01:10, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good lord. All <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHardouin_7fc4.html" title="User:Hardouin">Hardouin</a> had to do was open a discussion on the talk page - or continue the one that was already there.

The above post is not excuse for reverting the <i>whole passages</i> not even concerned with the "error" insinuated.

Rather than edit discuss, <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHardouin_7fc4.html" title="User:Hardouin">Hardouin</a> would rather follow and revert and has always been, without exception, the instigator of every revert war, even when clearly in error.

<p>Andrew, Ever since I can remember scientists have doubted Pluto as a planet. Even in university, I could not get a straight answer out of any of my profs. Why is a citation needed here?

<p>Andrew, two questions:</p>
<p><b>1)</b> What do you mean by saying my description of clearing its orbit is "original research"? All of the information in that section comes directly from Wikipedia articles.</p>
<p>Here is the quote you removed: <i>This means nothing of comparable mass may orbit near the planet. (While the phrase "comparable mass" sounds vague, there's no comparison between the eight planets and Pluto. The Earth is more than a million times as massive as any <a href="../../../n/e/a/Near-Earth_asteroid_7398.html" title="Near-Earth asteroid">near-Earth asteroid</a>. Pluto is only about 20 times as massive as <a href="../../../9/0/4/90482_Orcus_ce26.html" title="90482 Orcus">Orcus</a>, which has a similar orbit.)</i> Everything in this may be verified by checking out Wikipedia entries for the articles that I linked to. I have no idea why you are calling this "original research."</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is original research because you're taking information from other sources, and synthesising it into a new statement. The concept of "<a href="../../../c/l/e/Clearing_the_neighbourhood.html" title="Clearing the neighbourhood">clearing the neighbourhood</a>" is described very clearly in that article, it doesn't need amplification in an article which is about <b>Pluto</b>, not about general astrophysical definitions.
<dl>
<dd>Taking info from other sources and synthesizing it? I thought that's what encyclopedias do! And there is nothing "new" about that statement. All I was doing was clarifying the term. <a href="../../../m/i/g/User%7EMiguelMunoz_08f8.html" title="User:MiguelMunoz">MiguelMunoz</a> 19:13, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>2)</b> Why didn't you address my questions on the talk page? Did you miss the comments that I put into the text? (You deleted those comments when you deleted the text.) I put that sentence in because, from what I've been reading on the talk page and elsewhere, there is enormous confusion about the phrase "clearing its orbit," and I wanted to immediately put readers on the right track by comparing Pluto's mass with that of the other Kupier Belt Objects. I will be happy to put in a citation, if you would only make it clear what details you need a citation for.</p>
<dl>
<dd>A citation is needed for the comparison of the ratios of masses of Earth/Pluto and their nearby neighbours. That's the original research, in a nutshell - has anyone else explained things in those terms? If so, provide a reference. I'm not convinced that even with a reference, it would be appropriate for an article which is supposed to be about Pluto, not about how the IAU defines planets. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 18:21, 29 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Okay. While I think that a simple numerical comparison hardly qualifies as "original research," I'll dig up a reference. As for the question of whether this is appropriate in an article about Pluto, I would agree with you if there wasn't already so much confusion about this question. I've read many erroneous statements about what this means on several web sites (including Wikipedia), so I thought I should clarify the point right away. BTW We can probably come to agreement about what the article should say, but I would have appreciated if you had tried to communicate with me before removing the passage. Simply directing me to this page would have sufficed. <a href="../../../m/i/g/User%7EMiguelMunoz_08f8.html" title="User:MiguelMunoz">MiguelMunoz</a> 19:13, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll take a look. The Pro biography has been driving me nuts over the last year or so - I read about him in Graham Greene's <i>The Lawless Roads</i>, which was written on commission from a Catholic organisation and even more pro-Catholic than usual, so I turned to Wikipedia to see if there was a less biased account of his life (I love Greene, but when it comes to anything concerning Catholicism he's never objective). The article has ping-ponged between Catholics painting him as the holiest man who ever lived cruelly executed by a foul and oppressive government, and supporters of the Mexican republic painting him as a fascist terrorist. I did find today that the library at work has a book about the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cristero_War_05fd.html" title="Cristero War">Cristero War</a> which might well include neutral biographical details. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 19:19, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I could care less if she is a conservative/liberal analyst, however she is tied in with the wikipedia siegenthaler issue/debate. This makes for significant urgency for when that issue gets revisited by the media. For 6 months, a defamatory controversy section was in place. I have been trying to dismantle it as a whole, then dividing and conquering on a fact by fact source by source way. A serious number of wikipedians are not understanding of defamation and why we have to treat biographies of living people to such an extreme high standard. the underlying issues have a potential to erode wikipedia, better to discuss them now than another Sigenthal/Wales confrontation on Live From. <a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElectrawn_42d2.html" title="User:Electrawn">Electrawn</a> 20:07, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wouldn't break the 3RR unless (as in this case) by accident, but I would never enforce it either - the rule says that infractions <i>may</i> result in a 24h block, not that they <i>must</i>. Personally I feel it's more important to look at the context (in this case, a long-term editor of the page versus someone who is pretty clearly a follower of Lyndon LaRouche and therefore bound by the arbitration committee ruling not to push LaRouche's viewpoint in any article). 3RR ought to be a tool for improvement of the encyclopaedia, not an automatic process, which is why I ignore enforcement (though, as I say, I try to stick to the rule). I have self-reverted my last edit within that 24 hour period. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 08:54, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not interested in enforcing rigid rules, but 3RR has a rationale behind it. Instead of making judgments about others' views and acting upon those judgments to the extent where you find yourself reverting the same text even <i>twice</i> [with the exception of cases in which the editor you find yourself opposing is clearly a troll--something I don't see evidenced in either the edits nor the talk page discussion], indicates that the editing is not being driven by <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECON_c65b.html" title="WP:CON">consensus</a>, but rather by <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">a desire to have the article reflect one perspective rather than some other</a>.

<p>Andrew,</p>
<p>This is Fairview360. I work on the Srebrenica Massacre article. We have a problem with repeated disruptions at the article by editors who do not, I believe, want to improve the article but rather have an agenda of denial and obfuscation.</p>
<p>Every now and then, there is relative peace and then editors who do not all agree but have a common goal of improving the article begin constructive discussion and edits. If you look at topics #47 through #54 on the discussion page, you will see that indeed we do get down to constructive discussions when it is peaceful.</p>
<p>Currently, we have a problem with Bormalagurski and two of his associates Svetislav Jovanović and KOCOBO who are deleting sections of the article without good reason. This has happened before. Then we descend into an edit war. And then it takes a week to repair the damage and get back to constructive discussion.</p>
<p>The article definitely needs help, but we can't improve it when all of our time is spent thwarting users whose actual purpose is denial and obfuscation.</p>
<p>Given Bormalagurski's track record well researched by user:Kseferovic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Srebrenica_massacre#Just_so_you_know" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Srebrenica_massacre#Just_so_you_know" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Srebrenica_massacre#Just_so_you_know</a> , would it be possible to block Bormalagurski editing the Srebrenica article? There is no place for his belligerence towards editors and outright denial of genocide. Nothing good will come from his being at the Srebrenica article.</p>
<p>Given the recent onslaught, my guess is that Bormalagurski, KOCOBO, Svetislav, and others of their ilk have decided to attack the article.</p>
<p>Can you help?</p>
<p>I welcome constructive disagreements but not false arguments that are only meant to distract people.</p>
<p>Thank you. Fairview360 18:28, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm tempted to initiate an RFAR or RFC on the whole issue between Zeraeph and SandyGeorgia in their stead. I was the first MedCab mediator to attempt to resolve the dispute between the two editors, and it was flatly refused by Zeraeph. Further attempts at resolving this peacefully were rejected. Since then, it seems to have blown up to the blocking point. -_-</p>

<dd>I'd come to that conclusion too on thinking about it today - if Zeraeph doesn't do it, we should. I think it's way, way beyond the RFC stage, plenty of people have looked at the situation and nobody seems to think Zeraeph's allegations make any sort of sense. Arbitration's the way forward. I'm going to be offline most of next week (when Zeraeph's block expires), but I'll look again at the situation when I get back. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 16:02, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for referring me to this page, ajn. I am traveling and have limited (and excruciatingly slow) internet access for the remainder of this week and the beginning of the next. I will also be traveling for two weeks during October. The pattern thus far has been that 1) she refuses any type of mediation, and 2) any attention to the matter causes it to continue, and to escalate into further unprovoked and unfounded attacks on me; I hope anyone who engages Zeraeph is prepared for that, since I'm the one being smeared every time someone else engages. What hasn't been tried is simply ignoring the provocation: even though I have disengaged from the articles she edits and wasn't even aware of the drama unfolding on the AS talk page, others (including the anon AOL users) keep engaging. Torinir, I'm not comfortable with the terminology of the "affair between us": no one yet knows what her complaint about me is, I attempted mediation, which she rejected (as she did all 3 mediations), and I disengaged from the article (User Keyne notified me of the most recent mediation); she continues, and has escalated. I'm willing to mediate in good faith or do whatever is best for Wiki, but the pattern so far doesn't give me much reason for hope. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 06:35, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, anyone looking at the situation can see that there's no sense to it. I'm coming to the conclusion that the answer's a community ban, without dragging this out any further - it seems unfair to drag you into an arbitration case (which you obviously would have to be involved in, even peripherally) when you haven't done anything wrong at all. Mediation's obviously a waste of time. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 07:16, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks, ajn, and I appreciate your efforts, but I sense this is not going to go away easily. If I have to help with ArbCom, I will, but I do agree it's likely to be a waste of time. I saw the claim that I had e-mailed her, which I have never done (indicating she still believes I am the anon AOL users), so I suspect there is much more to this whole business than meets the eye.

<p>Update.

I do not believe an ArbCom will help in the long run, as Zeraeph may just use socks, proxies, impersonations, or any other means of harassing me. Perhaps some time will allow DeathPhoenix and Zeraeph to come to some agreement. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 23:52, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I believe myself and Justdignity made some important contributions to the Bully and Workplace Bullying topics back around May 2006 but the text kept on being immediately deleted by Zeraeph on the basis of no citations. But very little else on those topics had citations either. Zeraeph said she would be happy to reinstate my text if it had citations. But that left me at her mercy as to whether in her view i had enough citations or in the right places. She should have left my text in place with citation markers in place and I would have gladly provided citations. On her basis i hardly felt motivated to bother doing any more work. I would love to contribute more to the Bully, Workplace Bullying and NPD topics but not with Zeraeph around.</p>
<p>Please also check the huge number of revealing comments made by Zeraeph on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bully" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bully" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bully</a> I even created a subtopic called "Zeraeph" on that page back in May. The "Characteristic of Bullies" subtopic is also particularly revealing.

<p>Well youtube does not get much time on the page. You know it is a bit of a loss not to have a fun section in wikipedia where humor related to the subject can be linked to youtube. Information tough guy, and wikipedia policy not flexable. How are young people going to enjoy information if guys like you are into deletes and rvt. delete is so final. That is what happened to the dinosaws 65 million years ago, they were the deleters of youtube back then.

<dd>We forget that Kepla, Kapernacus, <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newton.html" title="Newton">Newton</a> were all kids at one time in their lives. What is important is that young people come to wikipedia for one reason, to see some good links to fun stuff on youtube and learn some good knowledge from wikipedia. You tube is not a print medium. More people watch tv than read books. youtube is the way to say a message. take simpsons cartoon. Need a mixture. One link to youtube will not corrupt wikipedai but deletes in wikipedia will. wikipedia is just as much ours as it is yours.<a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERoddyYoung_160f.html" title="User:RoddyYoung">RoddyYoung</a> 11:24, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">Ajn</a> - almost all of your remarks in the vote discussion concern my acts and nothing fact - and your vote seems to reflect the same. The very reason for my frustration is that the problem/solution is so head-holdingly simple - it is the <i>opposition</i> to any move - but two, not counting you - that is complicating things through any argument but fact. Look at the arguments in the page - who is asking for reference and stating realities, and who has nothing but vague ideals as argument? Have a look around at other references, namely other websites on "tall structures", and ask yourself why they don't do the same. No self-respecting reference would. The most "Paris" way I have <i>ever</i> seen it put an any site in any language is "Paris (including suburbs)".</p>

<p>Thanks for editing out the snarky comments by Wiyam on the Jane Grey article. I really do wish there was a way to lock that article so that all edits had to pass through a screening process of some kind. There have been three insertions of fictional material in the last week alone. It seems a waste of energy to have to keep track of that kind of stuff. And it degrades the overall quality of Wikipedia when people insert stuff written by BBC screenwriters and novelists ("popular historians") into what is an otherwise reasonably accurate and well documented article. It's enough to make a legitimate contributor give up and stop working on articles. <a href="../../../p/h/d/User%7EPhD_Historian_4e3c.html" title="User:PhD Historian">PhD Historian</a> 19:47, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree, to some extent - but it's very difficult on an open project like this to prevent that sort of thing. Having "registered authors" for articles would really defeat the point of Wikipedia, even if it would produce far better articles in some areas. I'll keep watching LJG. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 20:06, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To be perfectly frank, Wikipedia has a poor reputation in the academic and upper-level teaching community, owing in large part to its relative lack of control over content. Many of us involved in teaching do not allow students to cite Wikipedia when writing papers because there is no way for those students to know whether or not the content of a given article is valid. The Jane Grey article is a perfect example. Because of Wikipedia's open contribution policy, there is virtually nothing to prevent people from adding non-factual or unsupported material to any article. The scholarly quality of any given article is entirely reliant upon the presence of some person or persons keeping continuous and daily watch on that article to ensure that it is not rendered non-factual by a misguided contributor. So long as Wikipedia refuses to institute reliable quality control measures, it will continue to be a non-trustworthy information source. And that is truly sad, because it has the potential to be a really good free source of information. I'm quite happy to keep track of the Jane Grey article for now, but my patience will be limited. If contributors insist on fictionalizing the article, I will stop trying to keep it scholarly. If recognized experts in a specific field routinely have their work altered by non-experts, why should we contribute to Wikipedia? The effort if pointless unless the work can somehow be reliably protected and subject to quality review. Until Wikipedia asserts some kind of quality control over its content, it will always be little more than a billboard subject to constant grafitti. <a href="../../../p/h/d/User%7EPhD_Historian_4e3c.html" title="User:PhD Historian">PhD Historian</a> 21:49, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Andrew, I remember you took part in the discussion at <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_tallest_buildings_and_structures_in_Paris_bc5b.html" title="Talk:List of tallest buildings and structures in Paris">Talk:List of tallest buildings and structures in Paris</a> and I don't know if you are aware that there is now a mediation going on at <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_Cases_2006-09-10_List_of_Tallest_buildings_and_structures_in_Paris_393f.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Cases/2006-09-10 List of Tallest buildings and structures in Paris">Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Cases/2006-09-10 List of Tallest buildings and structures in Paris</a>. This mediation was called for by <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThePromenader_3b0e.html" title="User:ThePromenader">User:ThePromenader</a> whom you may remember. We're having a problem now because two users (ThePromenader and <a href="../../../g/r/c/User%7EGrcampbell_a0e7.html" title="User:Grcampbell">User:Grcampbell</a>, aka Bob) have bypassed the mediation and unilaterally edited the <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_D%C3%A9fense_eda4.html" title="La Défense">La Défense</a> article as well as about 20 La Défense skyscraper articles (such as <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tour_AXA_9e72.html" title="Tour AXA">Tour AXA</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tour_Total_75fe.html" title="Tour Total">Tour Total</a>, and so on) despite lack of consensus on the points edited. The mediator (<a href="../../../g/o/f/User%7EGofG_9903.html" title="User:GofG">User:GofG</a>) doesn't answer messages anymore (gone on vacation??). The only admin who was part of the mediation, <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">User:ALoan</a>, whom you may also remember, tried to stop Grcampbell from making these unilateral edits (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_tallest_buildings_and_structures_in_Paris&amp;diff=76875232&amp;oldid=76875146" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_tallest_buildings_and_structures_in_Paris&amp;diff=76875232&amp;oldid=76875146" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>), but he's now made it clear that he is fed up with the controversy and that he's giving up. Crazy situation, isn't it? A mediation with the mediator gone, and the only admin involved giving up. So I think it's time for other admins to step in.</p>
<p>I have already explained things clearly at <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html#Thanks_for_stepping_in" title="User talk:ALoan">User talk:ALoan#Thanks for stepping in</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html#Can_you_say_something.3F" title="User talk:ALoan">User talk:ALoan#Can you say something?</a>, so I won't repeat myself here.

<p>Is there a tool that is supposed to be used when a new category is added?</p>
<p>There are a lot of members of the new category and it will take a while to complete. I assume there may be disagreement about a few of them, but that can be handled on a case-by-case basis by people who are more familier with each philosopher.</p>

<p>Note: The category:Lay Philosophers description was changed after I made my changes. It originally said "A lay philosopher is a person who publishes philosophical arguments but is not a professional philosopher."</p>

<dd>After reviewing your "terse" - "Read WP:POINT." answers to my questions and your cryptic mention of "people who are behaving in ways they ought to know they shouldn't", I deduced that you must think I am someone else. I am not someone else and never have been - we have never collaborated before in any way - I was totally unaware of your existence prior to my receipt of a block notice from your.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, you seem to be a very busy and serious Wikipedia monitor, so good luck! (But try to slow down to avoid this kind of "accident" in the future) 75.11.190.106 00:48, 4 October 2006 (UTC) (previously 75.30.202.252)</dd>
