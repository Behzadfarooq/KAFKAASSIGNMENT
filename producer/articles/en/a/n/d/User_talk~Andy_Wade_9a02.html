<p>Hi Andy. Very interesting pics of the <a href="../../../o/a/k/Oakworth_Hall_ecb0.html" title="Oakworth Hall">Oakworth Hall</a> lintel etc. But these are not "<a href="../../../c/u/p/Cup_and_ring_mark.html" title="Cup and ring mark">cup and ring marks</a>" They are much too sophisticated and regular, and spaced precisely as a decorative motif between the arches, which must therefore have been carved at the same time. There is no way that such a sophisticated architectural fragment could be contemporaneous with prehistoric cup and ring markings, so even if there are similar markings found on stones on the nearby moors, the age of this carving must be vastly different, and I'd think it unlikely that it was brought from the nearby moor in its current form (more likely it was brought as an uncarved block of roughly the right size). Stylistically, I'd say it was perhaps late Saxon or early Norman, at the earliest, or possibly a bit of naive stonecarving from some later date. Does <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikolaus_Pevsner_5edf.html" title="Nikolaus Pevsner">Pevsner</a> mention it? (The celtic heads look pretty convincing, but I'm surprised Dr Anne Ross didn't mention them, or the splendid horseman, in <i>Pagan Celtic Britain</i>.) <a href="../../../s/i/g/User%7ESiGarb_95a2.html" title="User:SiGarb">SiGarb</a> | <a href="../../../s/i/g/User_talk%7ESiGarb_3f7c.html" title="User talk:SiGarb">Talk</a> 21:32, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi SiGarb. Yes I agree, I had my doubts as they didn't seem to fit the context of the description at all. I also reckon the ring marks are contemporary with the rest of the stone carving on the lintel. Maybe the stone mason was influenced by cup and ring marks, or someone that just liked this design? I know of cup and ring marks and a 'Swastika' Stone on <a href="../../../i/l/k/Ilkley.html" title="Ilkley">Ilkley</a> Moor nearby. This sounds like a local urban myth to me. I'll have to dig around next time I visit the library. I placed the pictures on there because I read what was on the page (I live locally to Oakworth Hall) and thought it would add to the page content anyway, but also to illustrate the text and maybe get an informed point of view. (seems it worked) I don't know the original source of the page text so I'm unsure of the next step. Do you think I should alter the text on the page to reflect this? I'm a bit new to Wiki. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndy_Wade_0cbe.html" title="User:Andy Wade">Andy Wade</a> 22:20, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi again Andy! As you will probably have seen by now, I was having go at the <a href="../../../o/a/k/Oakworth_Hall_ecb0.html" title="Oakworth Hall">Oakworth Hall</a> article myself, round about the same time you were writing the above! It still needs a bit of work, especially quoting verifiable sources for some of the statements. As I've noted on its <a href="../../../o/a/k/Talk%7EOakworth_Hall_d069.html" title="Talk:Oakworth Hall">Discussion page</a>, there are some statements there which seem to be contradicted elsewhere in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/i/g/User%7ESiGarb_95a2.html" title="User:SiGarb">SiGarb</a> | <a href="../../../s/i/g/User_talk%7ESiGarb_3f7c.html" title="User talk:SiGarb">Talk</a> 19:15, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi SiGarb, I saw those changes, it looks a lot better, maybe the reference to Thomas de Vaux being a Chancellor to Richard 1st should be removed altogether, or what do you think about just adding a <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> tag? I've contacted Bradford Libraries because they have some of Sir Isaac Holden's papers in their special collections and I'm going to see if I can find a reference to him having owned Oakworth Hall. I've never seen this mentioned before, and so far there's no evidence I can see to suggest that he did, so I'm going to chase this up in the next couple of weeks. I'm due a visit to the library soon anyway. I'm also looking to expand the stub about [Holden Park] that I've just started, so if you want to chip in to it, that would be great. I'm a member of the 'Friends of Holden Park' so I have access to quite a bit of info about the place. Not to mention lots of pictures...&#160;;-) I want to spread the word a little about the beautiful grottoes we have in the park. I also write the <a href="http://www.oakworthvillage.com" class="external text" title="http://www.oakworthvillage.com" rel="nofollow">Oakworth Village Society</a> website. I took a look at your profile, I see you live just across the valley from me, I live at Pickles Hill, just downhill from the Grouse Inn! --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndy_Wade_0cbe.html" title="User:Andy Wade">Andy Wade</a> 20:50, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
