<p>It is noted that the timing of your placing protection over the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medical_analysis_of_circumcision.html" title="Medical analysis of circumcision">Medical analysis of circumcision</a> is suspicious to say the least.

<dd>Sorry I don't buy that. Why did you wait until the edit was made by the most extreme of editors? This is an issue which is needed to be raised at policy level at Wikipedia. This "shooting from the hip" by passing admins must be controlled. If you know nothing about the subject then stay away. The system is not working when there is a 50/50 chance of whose version gets to be protected. All one has to do to beat the system is to get a "tame" admin to protect the page after ones edit has been made. I will be raising this issue on Wikipedia:Village pump (policy) as you gunslingers must be restrained. - Robert the Bruce 07:07, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Actually the protection policy says more than that. It even gives guidelines as to which version to protect. But gunslingers never worry about the fineprint. You needed to take this particular individuals history into account. You did not.

<li>I have made my point. I believe you came in shooting from the hip. I don't expect you to back down in public. My point is simple the system failled. Any system which acts like a flip of a coin, protecting an article has a 50/50 possibility of entrenching a particular version. This is not clever. Sadly, however the likelihood of a particular POV being so entrenched has better than 50/50 odds ... that is a real concern. - Robert the Bruce 08:11, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>Don't talk to me like I'm a moron, Andre. I'm the only one who's made any serious attempt to discuss anything in this dispute, and I've been ignored every single time.

<dd>Just an update, the article is now looking like it's going to go through a revert war (again). Since your edit, it's been reverted 3 times. <a href="../../../k/1/b/User%7EK1Bond007_3a91.html" title="User:K1Bond007">K1Bond007</a> 18:40, Nov 30, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>1) there is no copyright infringement;<br />
"I also believe that a lot of the information currently added is copied from articles that are also linked on the article and would fall under copyright infringement."<br />
if the article is from wikipedia as well, there's no copyright infringement and if the information fits to both articles it should be in both articles<br />
2) if there's a POV (see section: "Culture"), discuss it<br />
3) if you create a "revert war" you force me to do the same<br />

<dd>The exact same line found in the Guardian editorial was found in the America's Army article. AA Article: "...the U.S. Army, the world's biggest games developer, pumping billions into new software,.." Guardian: "The US army is the world's biggest games developer, pumping billions into new software." This is <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright_infringement.html" title="Copyright infringement">copyright infringement</a>. I also point to this line found in the Guardian: "Essentially a playable piece of PC propaganda", which was ALSO written exactly the same in the America's Army wiki article. Because of just these two lines (have yet to search for more) I do believe that the America's Army article should be reviewed for further possible compright problems. By the way, I believe you're getting Andre and myself mixed up here. If you wish to discuss this further see my talk page. 2).

<p>Hi Andrevan, I was hoping you could help me with an editing question. I've RTFM. Luckily, there's an example of what I've trying to do on your user page: "4,300 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Andrevan" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Andrevan" rel="nofollow">edits</a>"</p>
<p>Is there a way to do this without making it an external link? For example, I'd guess the syntax would be something like 4,300 <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions%26target%3DAndrevan_160f.html" title="Special:Contributions&amp;target=Andrevan">edits</a>, but that produces an error.

<p>(oh, andre, it's a bit pathetic that all you have as facts against what I have is the simple and childish allegation "craziness"... *clearing my throat*...) YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A LIAR, ANDRE. You quit because you could NEVER oppose my arguments since you neither had arguments nor had facts against my arguments. You still haven't commented on the improvements but while we were in an edit dispute, you had your friend lock it in fovor of your version. Policy: "Do not protect a page you are involved in an edit dispute over." Thus you totally ignored that one. Your little friend called what I did "vandalism". However, it was not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vandalism" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vandalism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vandalism</a> . If it was something then it was stubbornness but that's not vandalism and I didn't revert the page but create improved ones. I did most of the article from the correct dates of all versions over to the correct history and to gameplay. I only tried to improve it so it wasn't even stubborness, I kept my mind open all the time. You? You had it locked and tried to dig in the same aspects of the conversation we already had again and again to distract. You changed the article in your favour, lost the argumentation and now you try to win it by calling my arguments "nonsensical" - which is pathetic, since you were the ones without objective ones - and now you run away to have the last word and to win because you locked the article with your version. By the way, you lied about the 3-revert-rule too. On that day, the article has been reverted two times by me, not 3. (1st: from 22:18, 2 Dec 2004 to 22:02, 2 Dec 2004 . 2nd: from 22:57, 2 Dec 2004 to 22:18, 2 Dec) There were only two reverts by me. You? 1st, You reverted from 21:49, 2 Dec 2004 to 21:33, 2 Dec 2004, 2nd from 22:06, 2 Dec 2004 to 21:33, 2 Dec 2004, 3rd from 22:32, 2 Dec 2004 to 22:06, 2 Dec 2004. 3?!?! 3-revert-rule... you remember that word? There hasn't been vandalization by me (look that word up again) but you banned me instead of you. You even banned IPs from me only to keep your version!!! You're abusing your admin rights all the time and I tolerated that. The very least thing you could do is open the main article again and let it improve. Before I came, before I affected the page, it looked like this: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=America%27s_Army&amp;oldid=7907161" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=America%27s_Army&amp;oldid=7907161" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=America%27s_Army&amp;oldid=7907161</a> Now, with the version I'd like, it would look like this: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=America%27s_Army&amp;oldid=8163028" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=America%27s_Army&amp;oldid=8163028" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=America%27s_Army&amp;oldid=8163028</a> So could you please open it again and make way for progression?</p>
<p>"First of all, I didn't protect the page, Rdsmith4 did, to stop what he (rightfully) called vandalism" Yeah you must be feeling so cool having tricked the system! Just call your admin friend, probably just told him "help me please. just protect that page. thanks." Vandalism: Spam Adding inappropriate external links for self-promotion.</p>
<p>VandalBot A script or "robot" that attempts to vandalize or spam massive amounts of articles (hundreds or thousands), blanking, or adding commercial links.</p>
<p>Childish vandalism Adding graffiti or blanking pages.</p>
<p>Silly vandalism Users will sometimes create joke articles or replace existing articles with plausible-sounding nonsense (example (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia&amp;oldid=3005270" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia&amp;oldid=3005270" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia&amp;oldid=3005270</a>)), or add silly jokes to existing articles.</p>
<p>Sneaky vandalism Vandalism which is harder to spot. Adding misinformation and typos. Attention-seeking vandalism</p>
<p>Adding insults, using offensive usernames, replacing articles with jokes etc. (see also Wikipedia:No personal attacks) User page vandalism</p>
<p>Replacing User pages with insults, profanity, etc. (see also Wikipedia:No personal attacks) Image vandalism</p>
<p>Uploading provocative images, inserting political messages, making malicious animated GIFs, etc. Template vandalism</p>
<p>Adding any of the above to templates</p>
<p>Does any of these fit to me??? No! "I did not block it, as policy dictates, though I would have liked to! As for the revert rule: as anyone can see in the page history, I had only three edits on December 2nd:"</p>
<p>Yes, you're right, 3 edits from you consisting of three reverts. I had 8 edits, containing 2 reverts. Bond had 3 edits, containing two reverts. So why me? Because I added negative aspects of the game to the article which mainly neglected negative aspects. This article is not meant to be advertisement at all. Both positive and negative aspects belong to it. "On December 5th, which is what I blocked you for the second time, you had something like 5 reverts and I had 3 reverts, with one compromise attempt - a normal change, not a revert. Changes are not the same as reverts. K1Bond007 probably had several as well. Then, you returned with other IPs and continually reverted, so I banned the IPs." On that day I had 6 edits, containing 3 reverts. You had 13 edits, containing 3 reverts. Grover had one revert and some ugen had one too. Still no reason for banning me! "As policy dictates, I am not going to unprotect the page, because I was involved in it. Another admin will have to do that. I'm not going to be involved any longer because I don't care enough about it to be stressed out by your nonsensical (yes, nonsensical), POV, and biased arguments" So when is it going to be unprotected??? Never??? Why don't you tell that guy who locked it to unlock it??? Oh I see, you prefer your version and want it published as long as possible because... it's yoooouuur version with yooooouuur POV. You replaced the word "propaganda" with "advertisement" which is not the same and fails to define it correctly, but I must admit, it sounds better. And I must admit: if you only name that shooting teammates is punished and don't mention that shooting opponents of the US army is lastingly rewarded and indirectly called honorable, it sounds better too. And if you don't mention "propaganda", one of the strongest negative arguments IMO, in the first section of the text but that's for free and has the UT engine and many players... that sounds pretty good as well. But it makes it POV. There's no POV in mine, otherwise you'd have mentioned it. You can try to devaluate my arguments with any word you want, though, they'll remain valid and stable arguments while basically you have none.</p>
<p>Also, "This exception does not apply to reversions of well-established users just because you consider their edits to be "vandalism." Simple vandalism is indisputable—don't confuse it with edits which you simply disagree with." was totally ignored although it should be the case. Within a week, I added three main sections which you too agreed on. I've always tried to correct mistakes, search for compromies and convince on the talk page.</p>
<p>It is clear that it was a normal edit war in which you disputed and because you were invloved asked another admin to protect your version. It was on no account vandalism or anything. "Vandalism" is just the excuse in order that the following rules counts in favor of you: "In addition, admins should avoid favoring one version of the article over another, unless one version is vandalism. In this case, the protecting sysop may choose to protect the non-vandalism version." The policy doesn't say you're not allowed to unprotect it so you can do that, especially because there's a solution on the talk page, isn't there? No one has ever opposed the version I suggested (but which was ignored and immeiately called "vandalism"). But what about the article?? Are you trying to keep up a semi-permanently protection and simply stop participating in the talk page to take away all chances of improvement of this article or are you going to make it unprotected again? It's all up to you. You have influence, I don't.<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightbeast_4e64.html" title="User:Nightbeast">Nightbeast</a> 23:24, 8 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, I'm getting over the steamed up business pretty fast. Anyway, at least something constructive has come out of this! - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 06:13, 10 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeutrality_7a9d.html" title="User:Neutrality">Neutrality</a> and I are engaged in an edit war. He has also contributed to a request for arbitration (and RfC) against me. He has just blocked me.</p>
<p>Please note that the block occurred just after I had discovered a new RfAr against myself, and was starting to provide rebuttals to it.</p>
<p>I consider this an abuse of his adminship.</p>
<p>Could you look into this action, and consider whether un-blocking me is appropriate? <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheeseDreams_4885.html" title="User:CheeseDreams">CheeseDreams</a> 23:14, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Out of curiosity is there an easy way to find out how many articles you created etc or are you just keeping count? LOL.. I just want to know for grins and I'm not about to go through my history LOL&#160;:) <a href="../../../k/1/b/User%7EK1Bond007_3a91.html" title="User:K1Bond007">K1Bond007</a> 23:16, Dec 10, 2004 (UTC)</p>
