<p>St. Charles was founded in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1923.html" title="1923">1923</a> by Columbus Bishop James J. Hartley and was originally called The College and Seminary of St. Charles Borromeo. For the first two years, St. Charles did not have a building of its own until a school was completed in 1925. For the two years that the school was being built, students went to class at Sacred Heart School in Columbus. The first graduating class had just 17 graduates.</p>
<p>The legendary flood at St. Charles happened on January 20 and 21 of 1959. In a matter of 24 hours, nearly five inches of rain fell. The rain, along with the frozen ground (because of the cold January temperatures), caused the neighboring <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbus%2C_Ohio_64f3.html#Geography" title="Columbus, Ohio">Alum Creek</a> to overrun and flood the St. Charles campus. It caused over $150,000 of damage and for classes to be temporarily cancelled. Some of the damages include sinking of the lower chapel and ruining of about 25 percent of the library’s books. In order to prevent futures floods, a dike along the bank of the creek and the Alum Creek Reservoir have been built.</p>
<p>Columbus Bishop Clarence G. Issenmann decided to convert St. Charles exclusively to a seminary in 1961. This decision was unpopular but it stuck anyway. Only young men who were considering joining the priesthood were allowed to attend the school. Alumni pressure eventually forced St. Charles to revert to a college preparatory school in 1969. At that time, college operation was suspended and still is.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndland_To_do_list_1f83.html" title="Edit section: Building and construction">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Building and construction</span></h3>
<p>1931 marks the completion of St. Charles’ gymnasium as well as the Our Lady Lourdes Grotto. Major renovations were made to the gym in 1951 to more the double the capacity.</p>
<p>A <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanesque_architecture.html" title="Romanesque architecture">Romanesque</a>-style chapel (called the "Lower Chapel") was added on to the east side of the school in 1937. Bishop Hartley dedicates the chapel to Mother of Mercy. A Milwaukee art company beautified the chapel with artwork in 1952.</p>
<p>A natatorium was built next to the multipurpose room in 1990. And in 1999, the Jack Ryan Training and Fitness Facility was built adjoining to the gym.</p>
<p>By the 1990s, since St. Charles was no longer a seminary and it did not house students, the dorm rooms were not necessary. The current art room on the fourth floor was formerly used for housing purposes. In 1993, some of the dorm rooms were converted into a physics lab. In 1995, residence rooms for priests were also converted into classrooms because there are not many priests living at the school anymore.</p>

<p>Since St. Charles is an all-male school, the theatre department has had to use different methods to incorporate the female roles of plays and musicals. Both prep school and seminary students performed the first plays at St. Charles in 1929 under the direction of Father Joseph A. Cousins. Female roles were played by male students dressing up as women until 1971. It was then that Mrs. Teresa McLean (the school’s biology teacher) became the first woman to perform in a St. Charles play. The next year, female students from St. Joseph Academy and Bishop Watterson High School played female parts in a production. Ever since then, female roles for plays have been filled by open auditions from women at other Central Ohio schools.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndland_To_do_list_1f83.html" title="Edit section: Notable people">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Notable people</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Bishop James J. Hartley</b>: He was the Bishop of the Diocese of Columbus, Ohio from 1904 to 1944 who founded St. Charles. His 40 years as Bishop of Columbus are far more than anyone before or after. Under his tenure, the number of parishes with schools in Columbus went from 37 to 74. Also, he started what is now known as the <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Catholic_Times_e7f8.html" title="The Catholic Times">The Catholic Times</a></i>, which had an office at St. Charles for a short period of time (Fabro, 16-17, 165).</li>
<li><b>Jack Ryan</b>: Hired in 1936, he was the head basketball, football, and baseball coach at St. Charles from 1938 to 1964. In a four season span, from 1938 to 1942, the basketball team went 77-5. He is the only person in Ohio's high school coaching halls of fame for three sports. He decided to leave St. Charles in 1964 because the school’s conversion to a seminary meant that there would be little to no athletic program. He went to Bishop Hartley High School, another Columbus Catholic school. A state of the art fitness center was built next to the gymnasium in 1999 and named after him. He passed away in 1996 (Fabro, 69, 164-165).</li>
<li><b>Msgr. F. Thomas Gallen</b>: A student and teacher at St. Charles for 56 years, he graduated from the preparatory school in 1940 and the seminary in 1944. After that, he spent 48 years teaching at St. Charles (from 1950 to 1998). Originally, he was hired to teach music in the seminary, but has also taught algebra, pre-calculus, English, and <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregorian_chant.html" title="Gregorian chant">Gregorian chant</a>. In his later years teaching, he was given the nickname "Monz." He has since passed away (Fabro, 86-87).</li>
<li><b>Msgr. Thomas M. Bennett</b>: He has been teaching at St. Charles since 1963 and is currently the only priest teaching in the Diocese of Columbus. Originally from Detroit, he graduated from St. Charles College in 1953. He is a staple and an upper-classman favorite at St. Charles, having taught world and U.S. history, economics, and current affairs (Fabro, 114-115).</li>
<li><b>Dominic J. Cavello</b>: A graduate of the class of 1964, he joined the faculty of St. Charles in 1972 and became the first lay principal of the school in 1985. Under Cavello, there has been a significant amount of building and expansion on the campus including: a new natatorium, a new baseball diamond, a new football/soccer/lacrosse field, a new physics lab, theatre improvements, and the construction of the Memorial Grove and the Cardinal Circle. In 1998, the banquet facility under the theatre was named the Cavello Center.</li>
