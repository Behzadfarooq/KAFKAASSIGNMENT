<li>Moreover, what <a href="../../../g/o/e/User%7EGoethean_633f.html" title="User:Goethean">Goethean</a> hasn't mentioned is that we cannot take just your say-so that you've now aquired permission to use the text. We don't take the say-sos of pseudonymous users for that, let alone of anonymous ones. They are simply not verifiable. It is <i>the owner of that text's copyright</i> that must explicitly say that xe grants permission, not you. And the best way to do that is to simply licence the contents of xyr web site under the GFDL, removing the current copyright notice from the bottom and placing a GFDL notice there instead. An inferior way to do that is for you to send a <a href="../../../b/o/i/Wikipedia%7EBoilerplate_request_for_permission_3446.html" title="Wikipedia:Boilerplate request for permission">Boilerplate request for permission</a> to the copyright owner, and for the copyright owner to inform Wikipedia that it grants permission for the content to be licenced under the GFDL. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 21:10, 2005 Feb 15 (UTC)

<p>For a variety of reasons, it might make sense to spin off an article about Cohen's "EnlightenNext" and "Evolutionary Enlightenment". One reason is that now we have Cohen categorized as a "New Religious Movements" and as an "Intentional Community". Cohen is obviously not a community, intentional or otherwise, nor is he a movement. Any thoughts? -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 23:07, August 25, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sounds sensible. I'm adding "EnlightenNext" to the NRM list to encourage it being an article.

<p>What is wrong with it? Have you read it? Falk's criticism consists of cheap abuse, crap point scoring and weak sarcasm. He adds no value to the debate at all, since all his points are second-hand, with the exception of the Yogananda chapter. It is just trolling. Why would Wikipedia send someone to such a reference? It is not going to be useful to anyone. If someone farted would you link to it? This is just adolescent sounding off. van der Braak's book is an excellent and balanced obsevation of the day-to-day workings of a cult and without resorting to abuse or even harsh criticism he paints a picture which shows Cohen to be a very problematic leader. The Whatenlightenment site has ex-Cohenites discussing their experiences at some depth. These are devastating criticisms of Cohen and Wikipedia just doesn't need an unhinged rant to sit alongside them. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> nofalk1 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_nofalk1_1141.html" title="Special:Contributions/nofalk1">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<p>Willmcw: I don't see any statement in the style page you link to which would suggest that Falk's doc is a candidate for inclusion in the links. It does not contain neutral and accurate material, other meaningful, relevant content or cover a point of view expressed in the article (since it would be inappropriate to include unjustified abuse as a pov within the article.)

<ul>
<li><i>In 2002, Cohen's magazine "WIE" conducted an interview in India with Patrizia Norelli-Bachelet discussing her role in the Supramental Yoga begun by Sri Aurobindo, her teachings of Evolution, of a Cosmological perspective and of the limitations of the typical view of Enlightenment of the Buddhists. "WIE" did not publish the interview, made no mention of her in their "Guru and Pandit" discussions or an exclusive article on Sri Aurobindo's Supramental Yoga, "Why Sri Aurobindo is Cool". The main criticism of Cohen held by Norelli-Bachelet's students is the unanswered question, "Why doesn't Cohen make any reference to her work, even though he knows about her and even though he knows that for 30 years she has made significant contributions to the issues that he is just starting to delve into and expresses as a new teaching, regarding Evolution and the Cosmic perspective?</i></li>
</ul>
<p>This unsourced criticism seems awfully weak. It appears that unnamed students of Norelli-Bachelet believe that Cohen should give more credit to their master, should mention her more often in his magazine, and should have run an interview. This does not appear to be a serious criticism, and is unsourced. Can anyone improve it? Otherwise I think it should be deleted. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 23:14, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Agreed. I'm sure there are fifty million other people who have been left out of "WIE" and feel personally wounded by the oversight. But one particular and seemingly insignificant instance of such seems hardly worthy of inclusion in a biography about the magazine's founder. -66.155.208.3 04:35, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I couldn't find any references for it on Google either (apart from the links to wikipedia!), so I deleted it. I have no problem with including the material at some future date, but <i>only</i> both if it can be referenced (with correspondence or a copy of the unpublished interview or in some other way) and if it is mentioned as one among many criticisms of Cohen. <a href="../../../m/_/a/User%7EM_Alan_Kazlev_3836.html" title="User:M Alan Kazlev">M Alan Kazlev</a> 13:58, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've removed the line in the criticism section referring to Cohen's "apparent inability to confer similar teaching status on any of his long-time followers." Because the goal of Cohen's teaching concerns collective development, not personal enlightenment and "completion" as in many other spiritual paths, the criticism doesn't seem to apply. Also, it isn't true. He does appear to have students in similar teaching positions: <a href="http://www.eecourse.org/instructors.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.eecourse.org/instructors.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.eecourse.org/instructors.htm</a></p>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>In the film [The Cup], the Abbot writes about his wish that, "Nyima and Palden would continue to uphold the Buddha's teachings according to these modern times." What is it you're trying to say with that?</dd>
</dl>
<p>It doesn't mean they will change the Buddha's fundamental view. That should never be changed. I have met people in the West who are excessively attached to the external trappings of Buddhism. There is all this sentimental attachment to Tibetan customs and culture, and the actual Buddhist view is overlooked. In fact, I have heard that in creating a so-called "American Buddhism," some people are saying, "Okay, maybe the Buddha's view should be changed, now that Buddhism is in America." And that's not good. I would prefer that Americans really stick with the Buddha's view: the emptiness of inherent existence, that everything composite is impermanent, and so on. It doesn't matter if they leave out Tibetan culture. The really important thing is that they should accept the dharma. They should not worry about trying to design something better suited to Americans. The Buddha was an omniscient being. What he said was good for all sentient beings, and that includes us 2,500 years later. Nothing additional is necessary now. I see Westerners wearing chubas and showing off their malas. But I think the more people do that, the more they forget the essence, the actual point of the Buddha's teaching. It's amazing to see how eager some people are to adopt what is not essential, and throw out what is essential!</p>

<p>My idea is to add a link under the criticism section to <a href="http://www.whatenlightenment.blogspot.com" class="external free" title="http://www.whatenlightenment.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.whatenlightenment.blogspot.com</a>, as this site is maintained by many of Andrew's former students and makes claims about a number of abuses that occurred under his watch. The site holds to a journalistic standard of reporting accusations, and while the Cohen organization has responded to them several times they have not denied any of the more serious accusations made on this website. This site contains unique information about this topic and I believe should be included, considering many of the other links are vague and not very useful. The issue is whether to waive the general policy of not linking to blogs. Any thoughts?</p>

<p>I agree that critical links should be included.

<dd>I agree with you Mattisse that an objective encyclopedic article will contain critical information ... if that is appropriate -- leaving "appropriate" to be defined. If the same information that is in the blog were also published by a reliable source, I don't think there would have been a request for opinions on this issue. When the criticism is "original research" then its appropriateness for Wikipedia becomes questionable in my humble opinion. I think we agree on this, I thought it might be useful to express myself in case my presumption is incorrect.

<dd>I think you misunderstand me. That is not an encyclopedic reason for inclusion.

<p>I think Austerlitz expresses a commendable sentiment when writing:</p>
<dl>
<dd>there might be people going to meet Cohen because of this wikipedia article; they must know what -according to the experience of people having been there- can happen.</dd>
</dl>
<p>However, a central policy of Wikipedia is that it is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a publisher of original research, regardless of how accurate, useful or even important, that research might be. One may be able to present strong criticisms of this policy. Yet, this <b>is</b> the policy. A self published blog is a reliable source regarding the views <i>of its author</i>, but (generally) does not meet Wikipedia standards as a reliable source for <i>other</i> topics. Would this blog be considered notable in itself? Would we write and keep a Wikipedia article about the blog, or about its author(s)? Although the sentiments expressed are commendable, should these sentiments override the existing guidelines? If the guidelines are faulty (and I do not say that they are) a <i>greater</i> service would to provide a strong case for why those guidelines are faulty, thus enabling a consensus around better guidelines. That is my opinion, but please feel free to disregard this opinion if it will facilitate a consensus on this individual link.

<dd>Yes, we are discussing whether to include an external link. It appears to me that the rationale for the guideline which suggests avoiding external links to blogs is based upon the same philosophy as <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> -- namely avoiding possible sources of error, even if it means rejecting information that is possibly true. Blogs are generally not peer reviewed, and hence may be highly unreliable. The information in <i>this</i> blog may or may not be reliable. I have no personal reason to doubt it. However, if we begin allowing blogs based upon their perceived utility in providing information that is not available elsewhere, we open ourselves to a great deal of misinformation and bias. That, I think, is the motivation behind the guideline that says to avoid external links to blogs. Please feel free to express you position further if you disagree.

<p>It is unfortunate to not include a link to the whatenlightenment blog. The blog has voluminous, articulate, substantiated accounts written by scores of people who knew him best, i.e. his students. Why cite AC's blog entry of his Declaration of Integrity (which in itself is a response to the whatenlightenment blog) without referencing the whatenlightenment blog here? This failure amounts to a public disservice, in denying readers important information from another perspective. 12 December 2006</p>
<dl>
<dd>The criticism section itself is defective, and that needs attention. Criticism should be criticism and not end with an apologetic response from Andrew Cohen trying to rebut critics that is fully linked when those critics have responded but that fact is ignored. The contention is made that because Andrew Cohen's self published response on a blog to his critics is made by the subject of the article, it is allowable in this section but referencing the response is not.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html#Self" title="WP:V">WP:V#Self</a> states that: "Material from self-published sources, and published sources of dubious reliability, may be used as sources in articles about the author(s) of the material, so long as it is: relevant to their notability; it is not contentious; it is not unduly self-serving; it does not involve claims about third parties, or about events not directly related to the subject; there is no reasonable doubt as to who wrote it." But, Cohen's response is contentious, arguably self-serving his guru role, and makes unverified claims about third parties (ex-followers and critics). Additionally, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> states: "The websites and publications of political parties and religious groups (or websites of their critics or opponents) should be treated with caution, although neither political affiliation nor religious belief is in itself a reason not to use a source." Therefore, both the advocacy and critical publications and websites related to Cohen must be treated with appropriate caution, with a NPOV result in mind. Research has not yet demonstrated that the claims of ex-followers are necessarily less credible than those of followers of religious organizations, particularly NRMs, so a priori assessments of relative reliability are not NPOV. Additionally, because <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, WP: NPOV and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> complement each other, "they should not be interpreted in isolation from one another".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The article as it stands does not reflect the above, and just because Cohen is the subject of the article does not justify jettisoning NPOV.</dd>

<dd>His mother, Luna Tarlo, wrote a book called Mother of God about her experience as one of his disciples.

<p>Better, in my view, to maintain NPOV by simply deleting the reference to Cohen's response or whatever it is. It has no business being there under policy anyway. This is certainly tricky since it would be very sensible to put a reference to such an important debate about this character, but Whatenlightenment not only has no verifiability due to the understandable desire of the authors to maintain anonymity, but makes claims which without backup (although it is hard to doubt that they are true) could be libelous. --<a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBackface_55a1.html" title="User:Backface">Backface</a> 10:12, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I support that edit. Cohen responded to critics on his own blog, and ex-WIE editors, not anonymous, but whose names are public knowledge, responded back on their blogs. Wikipedia isn't taking a position favoring either, both sides having chosen this method of communicating, self-published blogs, these are the best available sources on the issues and thus appropriate. The article is primarily about Cohen but gives critics a chance to respond to claims. That is the way it should be, both sides are treated cautiously, there is an NPOV here, and there is no basis for a libel suit against Wikipedia. While the proposed deletions of both blogs can be seen as fair too, it diminishes the readers understanding of the issues.--<a href="../../../d/s/e/User%7EDseer_123d.html" title="User:Dseer">Dseer</a> 07:11, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, he needs to get the book published by a reputable publisher before we can link to it.

If the book was published by a reputable third-party publisher, of course it could be used. But why isn't it? Perhaps the publisher's legal depts didn't want to take the risk?

<p>Quotation from chapter XX.:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>This, then, is Cohen’s apparent worldview: His own stepping into the path of an oncoming vehicle has no cause, and therefore no responsibility, truly making him a “victim.” But severe mental illness afflicting others is to be overcome by an acceptance of responsibility from which he himself explicitly shrinks.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Further, since Cohen gives no examples of good things happening equally “without a reason,” one might assume that only bad things are thus spiritually acausal. Indeed, finding one’s “soul mate” or having a book on the New York Times best-seller list—Cohen is in no danger of either—would both presumably still occur “for a reason.” That is, they would happen perhaps for one’s own spiritual evolution, or for the sake of the dreamed-of “revolution” in one’s grandiose life-mission.</p>
<p>And to such gibbering “Buddhas” as this, one should then “surrender completely,” for one’s own highest benefit? Quite excellent. Austerlitz 88.72.6.86 09:04, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

If Mattisse followed HD to this article, why were there 5 weeks after HD's last edit to this article before Mattisse's first? I see nothing inappropriate about Mattisse's edits to this article, even if you disagree with their content, and whatever originally attracted him to it. Your accusations, however, are seriously lacking in good faith and civility, and therefore they are inappropriate, as well as your tone.

<dd>Accusations of wikistalking require an awful lot more than the fact that two (or three) editors involved in a dispute start editing the same article. This case is a long way from wikistalking or even harassment. As far as Mattisse's edits, they seem, for the most part, appropriate. It is not true that redlinks should never be removed; if they are unlikely to be turned into articles, they can be. It is also permissible to remove unsourced information about a living person outright. While you may disagree with what she's doing, the accusations you are levying, at least in this particular case, seem to be disproportionate. - <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheNuevara_65d1.html" title="User:CheNuevara"><font color="#F0B400">Che</font> <font color="#004411">Nuevara</font></a> 03:11, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Many people choose to join questionable organizations. Usually, they have a lesson to learn in being assertive. If a bunch of sheep find a bad shepherd, whose fault is it? If they are submissives and act in submissive manner, who is it that is doing so? It's unbelievable, but many people <i>want</i> to be told what to do and do so willingly, even eagerly. It's not surprising that others wake up, leave, and then blame their own stupidity on Cohen. It's always hard to tell what it <i>really</i> going on in such situations, so Wikipedia can only report what is written in reliable sources. I don't think any encyclopedia would do otherwise, and if you are suggesting that we should, then, yes, it does not matter here. —<a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHanuman_Das_3020.html" title="User:Hanuman Das">Hanuman Das</a> 14:08, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I diagree with Dseer's edits. I think that the criticism section should also contain Cohen's rebuttal. The concluding statement in his rebuttal strikes me as true and I want to use it in the article. The concluding statement is that even Cohen's detractors do not call Cohen a liar. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 22:23, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Andries, it is interesting you go ballistic over SSB but can't see how your statement about Cohen's concluding statement is illogical and misleading. That is because not only does the fact that it "strikes you as true" not prove Cohen's claim none of Cohen's detractors have not called him a liar (even a quick review shows they do call him untrustworthy, etc), but because in response to his claim he is specifically accused of crafting a statement which avoids the facts. Crafting a statement to avoid the facts which he is accused of is simply another form of deception, and whether he is accused of directly lying or just deception of self and/or others, he is not considered fully truthful by all critics.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The fact is that in response to Cohen's statement, the editors made the following statement in rebuttal: "Apparently attempting to finally give a public statement defending himself against the many allegations of his abuse of students documented previously here (and perhaps also in response to the current heated discussions on the Zaadz+WIE online forum), Andrew Cohen recently meticulously crafted and posted a "Declaration of Integrity", which in effect avoids the whole thing. Instead of addressing the actual facts, he predictably overwhelms us with his assessment of how great things are in the spiritual boot camp he has created, and why his ego-challenging teachings have proven his ex-student critics to be mere “failures”, or losers whose “life mission is to create and spread a negative picture of who I am...” What Andrew does say about the facts is that the stories have been “misrepresented” and given “out of context”. He never denies the charges, but only provides us with eleven pages of his self-justifying “context”, which is just the standard fare we’ve gotten from him for years now."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My edit does not prevent you from using Cohen's statement that even his detractors do not call him a liar which "strikes you as true" (NOR?), but the place for that is not in Criticism, because it is not criticism. May I suggest adding it to this paragraph as follows:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In October 2006, Cohen initiated a blog of his own. His first post, "A Declaration of Integrity: An Open Letter from Andrew Cohen to His Friends and Foes," was a lengthy response to his critics which he said was written to "speak out more directly and set the record straight." In this response, Cohen also asserts that not even his detractors "have called him a liar".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Or, if you want to create another section for "Cohen's Response to Criticism", fine. --<a href="../../../d/s/e/User%7EDseer_123d.html" title="User:Dseer">Dseer</a> 02:51, 13 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In Wikipedia the generally accepted practice is hat criticisms and their rebuttals are one subject. We could rename the section into <i>Criticisms and replies</i>. Even Van der Braak does not seem to question Cohen's sincerity. Untrustworthy, abusive, misguided, megalomaniac, whimsy? May be. But his dectractors do not not consider him deceptive. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 17:33, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ekajati says, and I quote: "Do not attempt to retaliate by removing reference to and links to Cohen's blog. That could also result in administrative action." However, this removal would have nothing to do with <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a>, and while your opinions about what is permitted are well known, what wikipedia actually states, as I wrote above, is somewhat different:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html#Self" title="WP:V">WP:V#Self</a> states that: "Material from self-published sources, and published sources of dubious reliability, may be used as sources in articles about the author(s) of the material, so long as it is: relevant to their notability; it is not contentious; it is not unduly self-serving; it does not involve claims about third parties, or about events not directly related to the subject; there is no reasonable doubt as to who wrote it." But, Cohen's response is contentious, arguably self-serving his guru role, and makes unverified claims about third parties (ex-followers and critics). Additionally, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> states: "The websites and publications of political parties and religious groups (or websites of their critics or opponents) should be treated with caution, although neither political affiliation nor religious belief is in itself a reason not to use a source." Therefore, both the advocacy and critical publications and websites related to Cohen must be treated with appropriate caution, with a NPOV result in mind. Research has not yet demonstrated that the claims of ex-followers are necessarily less credible than those of followers of religious organizations, particularly NRMs, so a priori assessments of relative reliability are not NPOV. Additionally, because <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, WP: NPOV and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> complement each other, "they should not be interpreted in isolation from one another".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The article as it stands does not reflect the above, and just because Cohen is the subject of the article does not justify jettisoning NPOV.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To repeat, the guidance for Self-published sources in articles about themselves is as follows:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Self-published material, whether published online or as a book or pamphlet, may be used as sources of information about the author, so long as there is no reasonable doubt who wrote the material, and so long as it is:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>relevant to the self-publisher's notability;</dd>
<dd>not contentious;</dd>
<dd>not unduly self-serving or self-aggrandizing;</dd>
<dd>about the subject only and not about third parties or events not directly related to the subject;</dd>
<dd>The reputation of the self-publisher is a guide to whether the material rises to the level of notability at all</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Clearly, Cohen's blog is contentious and self serving/self-aggrandizing and his "Declaration of Integrity" statement is contentious and self serving/self-aggrandizing, and involves controversial claims about third parties. Its use as a contentious and self-aggrandizing vehicle making suspect claims about others disqualifies it as an acceptable source for this encyclopedia even though Cohen wrote it. Your interpretation which allows Cohen's blogged statement to be directly referenced and linked, clearly violates the NPOV standard. As discussed above, because of this, if one blog is removed, so must be the other, and associated statements sourced from those blogs. I am therefore removing Cohen's statement as well, until you can find a suitable source. Retaliation? Nonsense, since <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a> is not being violated by removing Cohen's statement. --<a href="../../../d/s/e/User%7EDseer_123d.html" title="User:Dseer">Dseer</a> 04:53, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ekajati is so far the non-collaborative, rigid deletionist here, who has made unfounded assertions about both blogs, that Cohen's is protected due to "retaliation", and that "no blogs are permitted", neither of which is what Wikipedia actually says. A key point is, it violates NPOV to rigidly apply a standard of abosolute prohibition on the blog of recognized authorites on Cohen by falsely claiming blogs are a priori prohibited, while ignoring direct language of what is not acceptable in blogs that applies to the subject's blog as well, that is, Cohen's blog. Because Wikipedia states the materials of both NRMs (Cohen) and named critics are both to be treated with caution, what is done to one has impact on the other. Editors have some flexibility if it improves the article and understanding of this issue. Mediators have established that limited use of blogs by known individuals with expertise on the subject is acceptable where this is the case. This line of reasoning is well documented in the discussion above. Ekajati has essentially invalidated his own rigid statements. I have no prejudgement to exclude citing anything Cohen's blog provided a response is permitted also, to preserve NPOV. NPOV is my primary concern here. --<a href="../../../d/s/e/User%7EDseer_123d.html" title="User:Dseer">Dseer</a> 05:20, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, in fact, Ekajati, that passage is exactly what I am talking about, read it more carefully please, "normally to be avoided" is not the same as an absolutionist "not permitted", it implies there are exceptions, and you have arbitrarily ignored the possibility that the named critics, including those who edited his magazine professionally, are not a "recognized authority" on Cohen. Cohen's blog response to the critics and his explanations for his motives rather than outright denial of basic events cited by named critics makes it a dispute over interpretations of events, and serves as further evidence of the named, former editors of his own magazine being a "recognized authority" on Cohen, even if they no longer agree with him. As I said, mediators have not arbitrarily excluded all blogs under these types of circumstances, where NPOV is at issue, all factors have to be weighed. If you want to be literally strict, the language citing subject's blog "except where" several statements do apply to Cohens blog is as if not more absolute. What is required is collaboration including consideration of previous discussions, not oversimplification of what Wikipedia says. You may have made your own judgement about the integrity of critics but that is not what Wikipedia establishes as the standard. --<a href="../../../d/s/e/User%7EDseer_123d.html" title="User:Dseer">Dseer</a> 05:20, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Below is the current dialogue on the blpwatch page. I have advised Ekajati that he is not accurately presenting the situation or other editor's rationales, and that he is not quoting Wikipedia guidelines accurately in explaining his non-collaborative edits, and thus, that his edits will be evaluated accordingly based on the rationale he provides. I find no proof yet from anything he has provided that his absolutionist statements about blogs not being permitted or that removing links to a subject's blogs due to applicable exceptions is considered "retaliation" are in fact non-negotiable based on Wikipedia. Rather, I think that collaboration is in order. I hope Ekajati will first take this opportunity attempt to collaborate here instead of attacking the motives of other editors on that page. --<a href="../../../d/s/e/User%7EDseer_123d.html" title="User:Dseer">Dseer</a> 05:50, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Read the entire discussion related to the blogs, Ekajati, not just what you want to read. You claim Cohen's blog is inherently permissable because he is the subject, but what is being said is that to the extent Cohen's blog and associated blogged statement of "Integrity" in response to critic's charges, which does really not meet the criteria for use because it contentious; unduly self-serving or self-aggrandizing; and makes claims about third parties and their motives for criticism; and whose claims are to be treated with caution per wikipedia; is being cited, then a critical blog containing responses to those charges by named subjects of Cohen's criticism should be referred also to retain NPOV. If as an alternative material from neither blog is mentioned, or the mere fact that Cohen and named critics have both established blogs advocating their respective positions without further information is mentioned, then you do not have, as you try and suggest, an issue with <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a> that justifies your claims here. Your actual statment that:</dd>

<dl>
<dd>"Also, please note that the use of the <i>subject's</i> blog <i>is</i> permitted, but only in an article about the subject. Do not attempt to retaliate by removing reference to and links to Cohen's blog. That could also result in administrative action."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>not only mistates the actual policies for when a subject's blogs are not suitable, but does not adequately justify keeping reference to Cohen's blog entries based on wikipedia criteria just because you desire to retain the blog, and does not justify your a priori assumption of bad faith and "retaliation", and threats of adminstrative action based on claimed "retaliation". It is not "retaliation" to respond to your assumptions and POV editing. --<a href="../../../d/s/e/User%7EDseer_123d.html" title="User:Dseer">Dseer</a> 06:20, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your assumption that I am working from a POV is incorrect. I have nothing to do with Cohen whatsover. I am attempting to apply <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a> as written and intended. It is you who have a POV issue, and don't seem to be able to allow <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a> to take precedent over your apparent need to smear the subject. <a href="../../../e/k/a/User%7EEkajati_914d.html" title="User:Ekajati">Ekajati</a> (<a href="../../../e/k/a/User_talk%7EEkajati_e47b.html" title="User talk:Ekajati">yakity-yak</a>) 19:26, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You openly consider editors who disagree with you to be apparently motivated by "smearing" the subject, an admission of a biased and unsubstatiated judgement which proves the POV you deny. Ekajati, Wikipedia has three content policies: <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Jointly, these policies determine the type and quality of material that is acceptable in the main namespace. Since the policies complement each other, they should not be interpreted in isolation from one another, and editors should try to familiarize themselves with all three. Your POV edits do not take this into account. It is you making personal attacks, issuing threats of blocking and talking about "reprisals" when your one sided, POV edits are challenged. Your repeated explanation for your edits, that "blogs are not permitted per <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>", is not what <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> actually says, and therefore your edits will be evaluated accordingly. --<a href="../../../d/s/e/User%7EDseer_123d.html" title="User:Dseer">Dseer</a> 02:04, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ekajati was very active here, and collectively with his now confirmed sockpuppets A Ramachandran and Hanuman Das, et al, active on a number of sites with a non-collaborative, deletionist position on critical links. While his position seemed well documented, as various editors pointed out, his inflexible positions on excluding critical links were based on POV editing and not as firmly based in Wikipedia policies as he claimed, and so ignored his threats to propose banning editors who did not agree with him. Just to follow up on the discussion above, this is the latest on the expanding Ekajati sockpuppetry issue under which he is already under a two month ban.</p>
<p>User:Ekajati Suspected sockpuppeteer Ekajati (talk • contribs • page moves • block user • block log)</p>
<p>Suspected sockpuppets Chai Walla (talk • contribs • page moves • block user • block log) Baba Louis (talk • contribs • page moves • block user • block log)</p>
<p>Report submission by --Pigmantalk • contribs 01:58, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Evidence Ekajati (talk · contribs · logs · block user · block log) is under a two month ban for sockpuppetry. Currently confirmed sockpuppets of Ekajati are Hanuman Das (talk · contribs · logs · block user · block log), A Ramachandran (talk · contribs · logs · block user · block log), and Tunnels of Set (talk · contribs · logs · block user · block log). Hanuman Das changed his account name and was previously under the user name Adityanath (talk · contribs · logs · block user · block log). While still under the Adityanath account, two accounts were found to be sockpuppets of the Adityanath account: Baba Louis (talk · contribs · logs · block user · block log) and Chai Walla (talk · contribs · logs · block user · block log). See here for findings.</p>
<p>Since Hanuman Das is a sockpuppet of Ekajati, then accounts found to be sockpuppets of Hanuman Das are therefore socks of Ekajati.</p>
<p>As of 1/29/2007, Chai Walla is working on Yogiraj Gurunath Siddhanath [1]. This means Ekajati is using this sock to evade the ban.</p>
