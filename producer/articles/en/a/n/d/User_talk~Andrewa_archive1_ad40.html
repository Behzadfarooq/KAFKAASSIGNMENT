<p>Good lord, I had no idea a simple playing-around "beta-test" would cause such a furor! My opponent seems to feel otherwise. Keep in mind, at the time we started the game, essentially no one at wikipedia had really posted <i>anything anywhere</i> using Arvin's stuff, let alone play a game, so I thought I was justing testing around something new. I certainly didn't consider would actually think this was some kind of encouragement for people to pick up games everywhere.</p>

<p>Hi Andrew, could you take a look at my rewrite of the article on <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Rohl_d3df.html" title="David Rohl">David Rohl</a> &amp; offer your opinion about it? Obviously, I'm not a big fan of him, but I thought I did present him &amp; his ideas fairly. (Most of it was drawn from his web page, my reading of his book <i>Pharoahs and Kings</i>, &amp; an attempt to find mainstream scholarly opinion concerning him.) -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 18:40, 5 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hmmm. I think you've let Kitchen off a bit lightly. Has he answered, for example, Rohl's argument that the conventional chronology places the building of Solomon's Temple in a period in which Israel was impoverished, while Rohl's new one places it in a period of prosperity? IMO that's Rohl's best single argument.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There's no doubt that mainstram scholarship is against him, and on many issues I expect they are right. Rohl is after all still a professional entertainer, with an incomplete and unsubmitted PhD his best qualification. But I also think there's a case to answer, and I'm suspicious that Kitchen and the like don't answer it. I would have hoped that they'd be delighted at the interest others are showing in their subject. Instead they seem threatened. Methink he doth protest too much. And, he has an obvious vested interest in the established chronology. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 13:15, 6 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>From what I've been able to find, the policy of the establishment scholars is to simply ignore Rohl. The few who don't point out the presence of many errors or omissions in his works (&amp; I'm not an expert in the field, but I found enough of these to question the quality of his research). But you are right in saying that there is a case that needs answering: Rohl is an articulate &amp; persuasive writer, &amp; most of the arguments and evidence that explain or justify the conventional dating he is criticising are buried in the specialist literature, which is not easily available. As a result, Rohl's interpretation is the first the serious amateur interested in Egypt or the ancient Near East reads, &amp; afterwards colors her/his point of view.</p>
<p>Feel free to elaborate on Rohl's arguments. Frankly, I felt it was time to share my research &amp; move on to other topics. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 19:09, 6 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I found that meaning in the <a href="../../../o/e/d/OED_54e7.html" title="OED">OED</a>. I'll see if I can find evidence of it being used like that online. I may not have been precise enough since it was first British I think, and now chiefly AU/NZ, but the "especially alcohol" bit seems to be dialect or to have fallen out of use.

<dd>I just did a google search for "a swag of" (including quote marks) and in my opinion, the majority of the first ten hits are this usage. <a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabiform_a7bf.html" title="User:Fabiform">fabiform</a> | <a href="../../../f/a/b/User_talk%7EFabiform_a651.html" title="User talk:Fabiform">talk</a> 02:51, 9 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macquarie_Dictionary_57a6.html" title="Macquarie Dictionary">Macquarie Dictionary</a> confirms this usage, too. I "outsourced" the enquiry to one of their staff I know well, and he came back with the quote "a swag of medals", which someone applied to a recent Olympics, as the example (from the Oxford which I don't have either) which works best for him as a native speaker. This certainly works for me (as a native speaker too) but I think it may be a live <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metaphor.html" title="Metaphor">metaphor</a>. But should we list those? Perhaps we should. He hasn't yet commented either way on this.

<p>Hello, I read you comment on Alexandros' page about linking to old versions of pages being a good way of retaining histories. I just thought I'd mention an advantage I can see in doing things the subpages way, then the discussion remains searchable as the pages will be indexed by Google, whereas older versions of pages are not. Obviously it's not massively important, just thought I'd mention it. -- <a href="../../../a/m/s/User%7EAms80_ffe8.html" title="User:Ams80">Ams80</a> 00:23, 15 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Patent nonsense" means text that literally makes no sense. If something is written in comprehensible English prose then it is not patent nonsense, however silly the prose may appear to be. I would recommend reading <a href="../../../c/a/n/Wikipedia%7ECandidates_for_speedy_deletion_c969.html" title="Wikipedia:Candidates for speedy deletion">Wikipedia:Candidates for speedy deletion</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/t/Wikipedia%7EPatent_nonsense_6c73.html" title="Wikipedia:Patent nonsense">Wikipedia:Patent nonsense</a> again.

<dd>Hmmm. I've done that. Food for though, certainly. Thanks for the comments. But it seems to me that this is subjective.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm guessing that there's an article that I've claimed to be patent nonsense, and you don't agree. I think there have been three articles which I've claimed were patent nonsense recently: <a href="../../../m/i/z/Mizan.html" title="Mizan">Mizan</a>, which I listed for speedy deletion; Adam Jacob Muller which I didn't (and gave reasons), and James S. Baker which again I didn't. IMO these three all fit the second category of patent nonsense listed on the relevant page: <i>Stuff that, while apparently meaningful after a fashion, is so completely and irremediably confused that no intelligent person can be expected to try to make head or tail of it.</i> I'd say the same about <a href="../../../j/a/b/Jabberwocky.html" title="Jabberwocky">Jabberwocky</a> (the poem, not the Wikipedia article) and <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Cube_3125.html" title="Time Cube">Time Cube</a> (the theory, not the Wikipedia article).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So, while I'm happy (even keen) to have articles <b>about</b> Jabberwocky and <b>about</b> the Time Cube theory, if the poem <b>itself</b> were to be posted, or the theory were to be posted <b>as fact</b> rather than reported, I'd consider these both unsuitable as text for articles. Neither would be candidates for speedy deletion, but that's only because the poem and the theory are both famous enough to be notable (and deservedly famous IMO but that's irrelevant really), so the articles are not even candidates for deletion IMO, let alone speedy. But if similar non-famous poems or theories were to be posted as articles, IMO these would be candidates for <b>speedy</b> deletion under current policy. Which I think is good. VfD is under some strain, and part of the solution is not to have articles there unnecessarily.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So, there are five examples. Are any of them patent nonsense in your opinion? They all are in mine. And, if not, can you give some idea of what <b>would</b> qualify?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think it needs to be born in mind that anything in the article namespace is being <b>presented as fact</b>. So while obviously there's <b>some</b> sense that can be given to all five of these by imagining them <b>in another context</b>, in the context of the article namespace, there is none at all IMO. Which I <b>think</b> is what the <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patent_nonsense.html" title="Patent nonsense">patent nonsense</a> page is trying to say in paragraph 2 as quoted above.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps I have this wrong, and/or perhaps it needs clarifying. But it seems clear enough to me. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 05:49, 14 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I rather like both of them! Everking has made an incredible number of contributions, and the few I've checked have been excellent. Anthony has a great sense of humour. They both can be very hard to get on with. Hey, there's one sysop I seem unable to get along with, but people I do respect highly recommend him as a 'model Wikipedian', and he supported my sysop nomination, so maybe I'm the one who needs to make more effort. If people matter, then <b>all</b> people matter. And I think they do, however much some seem to deserve not to at times.</dd>

<dd>thanks for your comments... in each case the answer is I thought I had! This was my first try at deleting anything, and I would have liked it to be something less controversial, but this was not to be.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But I'm not quite sure what you mean about archiving... I thought that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Archived_delete_debates&amp;dummy=1&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=3079673" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Archived_delete_debates&amp;dummy=1&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=3079673" rel="nofollow">this</a> was all that was needed. I'm not too clear on the logic of the archiving system I admit, which is why I'm putting copies of relevant discussions into <a href="../../../9/2F/1/Wikipedia%7E9_11_victims_48de.html" title="Wikipedia:9/11 victims">Wikipedia:9/11 victims</a>. I've found it easier to find things in VfD history than in the archives, and I haven't seen anything that guarantees that the old discussions will be kept, in fact many of the MediaWiki pages have already been deleted... which means that, as these discussions don't appear in the history of VfD, they are as you say lost, or at least will be next time the database is reorged.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You might be able to answer another question... there are another two 9/11 victim articles coming up for transwiki-ing. How does this work? Do you know what the latest is? Just a reference to the appropriate page might be enough.</dd>

<p>I'm not familiar with the transwiki system. I've never used it. Maybe <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">User:Angela</a> can help.</p>
<p>Before we started using the transwiki system, we just blanked out the discussion on the vfd page after the article was deleted, and anyone interested in it would just go dig up the page history. Archived delete debates was for lengthy and controversial votes that had to be moved to the article's talk page. Now that most discussion take place on a mediawiki page, it looks like we have to archive everything (like how you added the mediawiki link to that page). There seems not to be any guidelines yet on what to do and I've deleted the mediawiki pages for some unanimous votes and speedy delete candidates. I had to undelete Template:VfD-Med because someone was interested in it. I guess the MediaWiki discussion should be kept as long as it's linked somewhere (eg deletion archives) and not just orphaned.--<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jia</a><a href="../../../j/i/a/User_talk%7EJiang_4fe5.html" title="User talk:Jiang"><b>ng</b></a> 20:47, 6 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

Given that I can't deal with moving <a href="../../../d/e/s/Dessication.html" title="Dessication">Dessication</a> back to the correct spelling due to the redirect's history, would you mind fixing it? -- <a href="../../../c/y/r/User%7ECyrius_3685.html" title="User:Cyrius">Cyrius</a>|<a href="../../../c/y/r/User_talk%7ECyrius_ef50.html" title="User talk:Cyrius">&amp;#9998</a> 04:45, Apr 10, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>OOPS! I thought that was all sorted out. Yes, I'll get to it... thank you! <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 05:40, 10 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Done. I hope to everyone's satisfaction, I didn't try the irreversible history merge as the only author losing credit is me, and I think that's OK. Also notice that <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desiccator.html" title="Desiccator">desiccator</a> was on <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_encyclopedia_topics_%2820%29_f0e1.html" title="Wikipedia:List of encyclopedia topics (20)">Wikipedia:List of encyclopedia topics (20)</a>, so we've patched a small but significant hole in the coverage along the way. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 18:21, 13 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The thing you missed was our tongues planted firmly in our cheeks. At least mine was, and given that RickK actually said "Eek", I think his was as well. -- <a href="../../../c/y/r/User%7ECyrius_3685.html" title="User:Cyrius">Cyrius</a>|<a href="../../../c/y/r/User_talk%7ECyrius_ef50.html" title="User talk:Cyrius">&amp;#9998</a> 02:02, Apr 13, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK. I understood that from RickK. Your comment puzzled me a little, but no complaints, if I wanted everything boring and predictable I'd go back to programming... not that it ever worked that way, but at least it was supposed to... <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 02:10, 13 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>
