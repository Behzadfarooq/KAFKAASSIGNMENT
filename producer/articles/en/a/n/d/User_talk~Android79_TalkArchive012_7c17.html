<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_TalkArchive012_7c17.html" title="Edit section: Request for advice">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Request for advice</span></h2>
<p>Thank you so much for your advice and assistance in dealing with DannyWilde. I wonder if you could advise me on how to proceed in dealing with another problematic user, <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> (<a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zordrac_64c1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zordrac">contribs</a>). Zordrac has gone to lengths to make trouble for me, on Wikipedia and off; according to his own account, he e-mailed <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a>, the person who originally posted on his "Wikipedia hivemind" page what DannyWilde later posted repeatedly as my purported real name, and told Brandt that I was "using weasel words in an underhanded way to discredit him"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Antaeus_Feldspar&amp;diff=31878088&amp;oldid=31876306" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Antaeus_Feldspar&amp;diff=31878088&amp;oldid=31876306" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> -- then, later, incredibly, claimed that I had <i>requested</i> him to represent me to Brandt in this manner. He's posted to multiple people's talk pages, making false claims about me such as that I violated the 3RR with fifteen reverts in 24 hours, that I was threatening and accusing him on <a href="../../../d/a/n/Talk%7EDaniel_Brandt_eca9.html" title="Talk:Daniel Brandt">Talk:Daniel Brandt</a> and said I was "watching him" (supposedly, I was doing these things a week before I purportedly requested his help, making one wonder why he would have accepted!).</p>
<p>It's more than just a case of "one person meant it as this but the second person interpreted it as that instead"; here is what Zordrac writes about me at User:Zordrac/Poetlister: "08:16, 23 December 2005 <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">User:Antaeus Feldspar</a>, wrote to Zordrac supporting Lulu and implying that they both would stalk Zordrac until either he stopped trying to get Poetlister's ban reversed, or else was banned from Wikipedia. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zordrac&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=32414326" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zordrac&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=32414326" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>" As you can see by checking the diff, there is no mention <i>at all</i> of Lulu, or of Poetlister and his/her ban.</p>
<p>I don't want to go on forever listing the false claims here; what I'd like to know is where to list it and in what format so that I can bring some sort of formal action. I wish I could just ignore it, but my experience has been that just as Zordrac and DannyWilde found each other, just leaving the lies there will result in some other trouble down the line. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 00:42, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Android79, <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoogie_man_9493.html" title="User:Googie man">Googie Man</a> here - I wanted to ask you something as a fellow baseball fan. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_db2d.html" title="User:Jimbo">Jimbo</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_Beesley_e0b3.html" title="User:Angela Beesley">Angela</a> have made a new webstie called <a href="http://baseball.wikicities.com/wiki/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://baseball.wikicities.com/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Wikicities</a>. This link in particular will take you to the baseball Wikicity. As you'll see it's similar to Wikipedia, but my hope is this will allow baseball fans to do more and different things, like reporting on games, in depth statistics, create mulitple pages for pictures, and whatever else baseball fans care to create. You've done such great work on Wikipedia I was hoping you could help get this baseball Wikicity off the ground. Please tet me know what you think either at my talk page, or you can email me at terry@wikia.com.

<p>Yes, I would prefer an official statement than a press report. Two reasons: One, I cannot remember who it was or what team it was, but a couple of years ago the press announced that this person was all set to be the head coach of a particular team, but early in the morning of the following day, the team officially announced that he pulled out (I think it was Mike Zimmer and the Raiders). Second, I am sure you have seen the headlines about the <a href="../../../s/a/g/Sago_Mine_disaster_ce06.html" title="Sago Mine disaster">Sago Mine disaster</a> and how earlier news reports said that all of the miners were alive. <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> <a href="../../../z/z/y/User_talk%7EZzyzx11_0d23.html" title="User talk:Zzyzx11">(Talk)</a> 05:41, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I see your point, but the Strib has a pretty good track record when it comes to these sorts of things. I'm willing to eat my hat if it turns out to be false tomorrow morning. Misreporting deaths as survivals is incredibly tragic; misreporting the hiring of a football coach is annoying but no big deal in the grand scheme of things. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 05:45, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Got another POV attack controversy I'd appreciate your comments on the talk page with... some religious folks want to try to redfine myth to mean "religions that are false" and of course take their own religion (Christianity) out of it (and occasionally make reference to maybe possibly doing the same for one or two other major current religions). It went up for RFC but that only means now that a number of people are showing up not understanding the academic definition and not even bothering to read earlier comments and raving about how it's awful to insult their religion. The whole point is that academic study of mythology doesn;t make any comment whatsoever on whether the stories are actually true or not, just that the culture believes they are and hold supernatural and philosophical meaning. To separate Christianity (and other huge mainstream religions) out not only messes up the academic definition but is highly POV by stating outright that, say, Pagan mythology is false.

<dd>It was already locked by an editor I asked to look at it, so all we really need is editor input. All sides -- pro-changing definition, keeping definition, and those who aren;t following the definition argument -- has rejected mediation as something that interferes with consensus building. I'd just like someone I know understands that NPOV means NPOV for all sides and not just "we can't say that because someone in my particular group could misread it and be offended so we'll change it and not worry about offending other people who aren't as important as us". <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 01:15, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not really sure about how to insert myself into this debate. The editors making the more hysterical arguments seem to have quieted down. I'd like to chime in, but I need something more substantial to say than "Ditto DreamGuy". I'll keep an eye on it for now. Do you have an online source that supports your definition of "myth"? I'm surprised that this is causing such a commotion (well, not really, once religious fervor and political correctness enters into it, but that's another can of worms). When it comes to mythology, you might call me an interested layman, and even I understand the difference between the popular and academic definitions of "myth". <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 16:16, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A number of sources have been posted on the academic definition, mostly on the archive pages (because the current controversy ran through lots of heat and pushed them off the page). There is also a greek definition link posted here and there that Codex keeps ignoring and then people looking around dictionaries until they found ones that only had the definitions they want... one of those was the OED, but then a more recent copy of it, quoted in a recent post, has the academic definition. It's all there. Right now there's one guy who absolutely is convinced all the sources are lies, he's not going to be convinced, and a couple of people saying they are compromising but basically campaigning to do the exact same thing they wanted to do on <a href="../../../m/y/t/Mythology.html" title="Mythology">Mythology</a> but now on <a href="../../../m/y/t/Myth.html" title="Myth">Myth</a> (which was a redirect, and is where a ton of articles link to, I think they just want to put their info on a fork file where more people will see it).

<p>It makes little sense to call the deletion of worthless info from the Rush Limbaugh entry "vandalism" I was simply trying to shorten an already too long article.</p>
<p>As for Rush's comment on Abu Ghrabib, I can assure it is true. I can't site it. How can I? How can you site a radio show? I do know it happened in the last week of October 05. On a Friday, I think. Is there anyway we could get other Rush listeners to comment on this? I resent that only one listener can comment "I don't recall hearing this on the show" and the comment gets banned.</p>
<p>I'm new to Wiki. I am alarmed by your threats to ban me. At least give me a good heads up first before you resort to those tactics. I didnt know that I had to refrain from altering an article simply because one guy hates it. Also, i didnt even know that anyone disagreed with it at first, until much later when I looked into the history file of the Rush entry. My edits where sound and logical. You may not like that I provided citation for the Abu Ghrabib info, but my edits were still fantastic, making a long article more readable.</p>

<p>Hey, Android, I just saw your note on Bunchofgrapes' page. I've hardly been involved with the article--somewhat with the user--but I'm finding it quite a wild ride merely to have <a href="../../../b/i/g/Bigfoot.html" title="Bigfoot">Bigfoot</a> on my watchlist. Have you thought of going straight to an RFAR? IMO, an RFC is, if not quite a waste of time, then at least an unnecessary detour, in a textbook case like this. (Of course I don't mean all the work you've already put into the RFC draft would be wasted, as that could easily be recycled into RFAR evidence.) Contrary to popular opinion, an RFC is <i>not</i> required before an RFAR. I do believe the arbcom would accept a case like this. In fact I was just experimentally typing some evidence notes, and thinking of contacting DreamGuy, when I came across your message to bunch. How about it? If you think it would be any use, I'd be glad to write an evidence section for an RFAR. (For an RFC, not so much.) Though probably you'll get all you need without that, too. Best, <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 03:23, 13 January 2006 (UTC).</p>

<li>I've generally not liked the idea of "fast-tracking" to ArbCom... but maybe it really is appropriate for a case like this. I'm willing to be convinced. If Beckjord really is "out of town" on an "expedition" as he said, then there's really no hurry. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 05:54, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I personally think arbitration is good insofar as that's what it takes to establish sockpuppetry. Otherwise, let's not waste their time with an obvious case like this. Admins can block for disruption, and if there's reasonable consensus for it, the blocks will stick. I guess I should clarify; I'm not <i>opposed</i> to arbitration; it may well be helpful. But they may have better things to do with their time. If we can manage to resolve the situation without arbitration, we should do so. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 06:28, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, I think this is what we have an ArbCom for, Friday. An ArbCom ban would get more validity and support from the community than blocks by individual admins, and you guys need all the legitimacy you can get, if you're going to keep an AOL user at bay. (AOL blocks are worse than meaningless, they create havoc for virtuous users while the target rides the rotating proxies.) Maybe sanctions and reprimands by the ArbCom might even help with the user's attitude problem, you never know. And if not, then having his editing officially discredited and shunned may be the only way. For instance, only the ArbCom can impose a revert-on-sight on a recalcritant banned user (and recalcritant is B's middle name). <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 19:48, 13 January 2006 (UTC).

<dd>Well, gosh, when you put it that way, it sounds pretty darn obvious. If they don't accept the case, we could always do the RFC as a backup plan.

<p>Android:</p>
<p>I need your advice. If you have a chance, see the AMA talk page. There is a proposal that, after much discussion, Izehar and I put forth to revamp adn reform the AMA. The vote was 9-7 with a deadline of the 23d when some of the opposers Sam Spade and Wally for example) decided they wanted an alternative proposal heard instead and wanted the voting to be stopped. I opposed that because they were a bunch a people (now 9-10) that wanted the first proposal and I didn't think it was right to suspend that without some consensu from them before moving on with a different idea, <b>especially</b> when those same opposers participated in the initial duiscussona dn could have put that idea forth then. I am arguing that we finish the first voting first and then move on to other idea if it fails to reach a consensus.</p>
<p>I trust your opinion. Am I wrong or missing something here?</p>

<p>I saw on ANI that Kelly Martin doesn't think the evidence sufficient for a Checkuser sockcheck of "Dr Joe" and other Beckjord footwear. A pity, but also yet another reason for going straight to RFAR: CheckUser <i>is</i> used for sock accusations in requests for arbitration. I'm not sure if that can happens as soon as the request is filed--maybe not, since it would invite gaming of the system--but I do know it will happen once the request is accepted by the arbs.

<dd>Sounds good. I suppose you saw my note <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Android79/RFC&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=35266581" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Android79/RFC&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=35266581" rel="nofollow">here</a>? Are you planning to set up a RFAR request template in your userspace? I was told something by an arbitrator that surprised me: that once a case has been accepted, nobody's ever going to look at the original (probably very painstakingly set up!) request again: an evidence page will be created on acceptance, and <i>that'</i>s the one the arbs will be reading. The moral of this, I guess, is that we need to take the advice on the RFAR page very seriously: "If you are going to make a request here, <b>you must be brief</b> and cite supporting diffs." Don't use all your evidence on the request, save it for the Evidence page later. Diffs must be cited in the request, but only a small, representative selection—the best diffs. Also, of course, the arbcom are more likely to get round to reading a compact, punchy request; they're human.</dd>
<dd>Of the ones I know, btw, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Antifinnugor_7c0f.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Antifinnugor">Antifinnugor</a> was comparable to this case, with a similarly committed and unscrupulous editor. I think its <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Antifinnugor_Evidence_691c.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Antifinnugor/Evidence">Evidence page</a> might be useful as an example.</dd>
<dd>Another thing: if you take a look at the RFAR page and their request template, you'll see the importance of trying mediation first. Lack of mediation seems to be the most common reason they reject a request. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 19:49, 15 January 2006 (UTC).
<dl>
<dd>See User:Android79/Arb. I agree that being concise is key; we can shorten that and sprinkle in the "best" diffs. As for mediation, it's clear that it would be futile, as would an RfC likely be; if ArbCom rejects because of that, well, I'll guess we'll just have to prove ourselves right on that count. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 19:58, 15 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, I agree that it's pretty sure to be futile. But I still think it would be good to have even a futile effort to show the arbcom. It's not like it'd cost much effort just to ask Beckjord if he'll agree to mediation, with, say DreamGuy (the obvious choice—of course DG should be asked first!). At least, not compared to the disheartening effort of a rejected RFAR. Or alternatively, you might submit a short but eloquent explanation of why it would be pointless to even ask B. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 20:52, 15 January 2006 (UTC).

<p>It's like a Greek tragedy, but we probably better go through all the steps. The Rfc appears to have enough meat in it, but the supply is almost limitless if we need to dig up more info.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 21:39, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm willing to consider an attempt at mediation; given the recent hostility directed towards me and DreamGuy, I don't think anything with either of our names on it would be a good idea -- Beckjord would just continue his tirades. We would need someone else to attempt mediation, someone involved at <a href="../../../b/i/g/Bigfoot.html" title="Bigfoot">Bigfoot</a>, but someone with whom Beckjord hasn't identified as an enemy. (Yeah, I know, short list.) <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 21:43, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not sure how mediation works here... there are some "Cabal mediation" people running around who do not seem to be the same as the people at <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_eaa9.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation">Wikipedia:Mediation</a>. I would encourage anything that involves mediators who are not self-appointed and hold some sort of sway. Frankly, Beckjord clearly isn;t going to listen to anyone, so trying to find someone not on his enemy list to participate is futile, as anyone who has interacted there is already on his list and anyone new would have no standing for mediation. But his actions are so clearly beyond acceptable i think ArbCom ought to step in right away. Hitting them with the evidence that he clearly intends to keep putting his info in regardless of what anyone says and that if he doesn't get his way he'll just cause disruption means nothing short of a total smackdown will do. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 23:42, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Android, I think it <i>ought</i> to have one of your names on it, as the disputant: it ought to be one of B's prominent opponents, someone he's engaged with (and insulted) a lot. I don't agree that the mediator should have been involved with editing <a href="../../../b/i/g/Bigfoot.html" title="Bigfoot">Bigfoot</a>; I think that's rather a disqualification from the role. DreamGuy, would you agree to represent the side of reason in a mediation attempt with B? Forget about the <a href="../../../t/i/n/WP%7ETINMC_f912.html" title="WP:TINMC">Mediation Cabal</a>, they're backlogged anyway, and take a look at <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_eaa9.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation">Wikipedia:Mediation</a>, see what you think. If you're agreeable, apparently the very first step (and most likely the last) would be for you to ask B if he'll agree to mediate: "Disputant(s) should contact the other party and get their consent for mediation, then contact the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Committee_9b92.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Committee">Wikipedia:Mediation Committee</a>, who will then appoint someone to act as a mediator." Heck, I know the page goes on to say that you're obliged to believe the process might reach the desired result... but they're not the thought police, and you could always <i>hope</i> the process might be successful, right? Considering not only B's behavior here, but his long previous internet career, I know it takes some optimism. But, anyway, I won't go on about it any more. Maybe you guys are right that the ArbCom won't insist on mediation in this case. Just, do <i>say</i> something in the request about why it would be pointless. Btw, I've added a statement to your RFAR subpage, Android. Please use it any way you like, or not at all, feel free. Integrate with yours if you like some of the phrasing, keep it separate and shorten both, or delete — whatever. I can just as well use it when there's a real Evidence page, so don't be shy about deleting it!

<p>I really don't know what to do with that article. I used to rewrite it every two weeks, just to keep it clean. It's become a horrible monster of a Wiki page.

<dd>Did you see the mess in the artistry section also? OH. MY. GOD. It had weird links to mjjforum and people citing themselves as authoritive sources. It is now literally plastered in "citations needed" by me to protect against taking opinion and uncited info as fact. The trouble with splitting the article up is that we then can't check what is happening to the rest of the article frequently. It's hugely expanding out of the ability to check it properly.

<p>Hello there! I wanted to thank you for taking the time to vote on my arbitration commitee nomination. Although it was not successful, I appreciate the time you spent to read my statement and questions and for then voting, either positively or negativly.

<p>Do you have anything to add to Beckjord arbitration....Bishonen mentioned that her image gallery had been vandalized by Beckjord after she blocked him. I already put in a bunch of diffs on the evidence page and didn't want to hog them all, so if you want to mentioned Bishonen's comment to me, that would be great. It's a tedious chore but we should all voice our thoughts, especially with the level of personal attacks he has waged.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 12:22, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>To a resolution of the Beckjord issue:</p>
<p>There has been a giant misunderstanding by yourself and DreamGuy about me where is seems you have assumed that I was trying by my edits to convince readers that "Bigfoot" already 1)exists and 2) is proven and verified.</p>
<p>Not so, Grasshopper.</p>
<p>1) Bigfoot is not verified, not proven, not established by science as a zoologiccal apecies.</p>
<p>2) I never said it was, and never meant to imply it was.</p>
<p>3) The word "Bigfoot" means with quotes, it is a nickname and not a real animal proven real.</p>
<p>Those of us who do research find it tiresome to keep using quotes all the time. Maybe, in Wiki, we need to use quotes all the time,however, a real animal has a scienmtific, taxonomical name, like canis lupis, the wolf.</p>
<p>I feel you see the word Bigfoot with no quote marks and think this means we are trying to pull a fast one. Not true. We are not.</p>
<p>4) We are trying to find evidence to prove it (they) are a zoological species, OR, some type of paranormal being that may, or may not, come from other parallel words to confuse us.</p>
<p>We do not have that evidence, yet. We may never get it. It is my suspicion that if after 1406 years, and we do not have zoological evidence, that we never will. Thus, we shift to plan B.</p>
<p>5) On the Bigfoot article, we simply want to point out the alternatives in theories.</p>
<p>You don't like that. Yet, many well-credentialled scientists are looking that way.</p>
<p>You seem to want to keep this info from the readers. Please stop.</p>
<p>6) Try this -- YOU, modify the page and put in this opening statement, which is more accurate:</p>
<p>"Bigfoot"is the nickname applied by witnesses and others to an visual phenomenon that appears to resemble a man-like, erect, hair-covered being that superficially resemebles an erect primate. This phenomenon is not a proven zoological species and researchers acknowledge this. However, a dedicated group of laymen and a few scientists (Dr Meldrum, Dr. Bindernagel) are attempting to gather evididence that will satisfy the rules of zoology. Whenever the word Bigfoot is used without quote marks, or other nicknames from other regions, this does not mean this is an accepted, real and proven zoological animal.</p>
<p><br />
7) Try it. If can work. Endless reverts are simply insulting and cause more reverts. Better to edit, and not blindly revert.</p>

<dd>I appreciate your attempts to mend fences here and work <i>with</i> us, but when you do stuff like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Elonka&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36989966" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Elonka&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36989966" rel="nofollow">this</a> you're just talking out of both sides of your mouth.

<dd>Android, speaking of compromise, did you see my suggestion in the "DreamGuy dispute" section above?<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAndroid79&amp;diff=36902820&amp;oldid=36894085" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAndroid79&amp;diff=36902820&amp;oldid=36894085" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>.

<dl>
<dd>I'm confused as to how this is any sort of compromise. It includes two things you want (removal from my talk page, and consolidating related info in one place) with nothing that I want. As I said before: everything currently on this talk page is going buh-bye to archiveland in less than 48 hours. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 19:03, 29 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, per the discussions at the <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Incidents_947b.html#Wikipedia" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents">Admin noticeboard</a>, it would seem that I have the authority to refactor comments. I'm trying to respect your sovereignty here on your userpage though, so, rather than me going in and mucking around, may I respectfully request that you simply not archive that particular section of your userpage, or perhaps simply include a diff to the particular section? Based on the policy at <a href="../../../r/e/f/Wikipedia%7ERefactoring_talk_pages_ad80.html" title="Wikipedia:Refactoring talk pages">Wikipedia:Refactoring talk pages</a>, that would seem like the best way to handle this, and would go a long way towards showing good faith on this. I'm also open to alternative ways of handling it, as long as the end result is that the personal attacks are gone off of the live pages. Respectfully, <a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 21:55, 31 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>When I archive later today, I'll include a diff link. I'm not doing this out of having a need to "show good faith" or anything else – I just wish to wash my hands of the whole mess. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 22:30, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Actually, one more thing: I request that you refactor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=37526504" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=37526504" rel="nofollow">this</a> personal attack. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 22:37, 31 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm truly pleased to hear that. &#160;:) Regarding the refactoring request, you're referring to my post pointing out that Hipocrite has a pattern of posting random insults that is similar to someone exhibiting <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_is_a_troll_2a9e.html" title="Wikipedia:What is a troll">disruptive behavior</a>? Sure, I'm willing to do that. What would you like me to change it to? <a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 22:47, 31 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The point is not for me to tell you what to refactor it <i>to</i>. The point is for you to recognize that calling someone else a troll – especially someone with a constructive editing history and generally calm demeanor, like Hipocrite – is a completely unconstructive personal attack. The words "pot", "kettle", and "black" come to mind. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 23:51, 31 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Did you take a look at the diffs I provided? Hipocrite has been posting random attacks on my talk page, being <i>extremely</i> uncivil at the AMA, adding completely false statements in edit summaries at my bio page, and rude messages at ANI besides. I agree with you that Hipocrite also does some <i>good</i> edits, but there have been plenty of examples otherwise in the last few days. In any case, I promise to remove my message, in return for your refactoring the DreamGuy discussions off your page. I'm also willing to remove these recent messages too. I'm far more willing to work <i>with</i> Hipocrite than against, if Hipocrite behaves in kind. <a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 00:11, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
