<p>Am I ever glad to hear from you. I've never participated in an ArbCom much beyond weighing in on a matter. So...what do you need me to do? - Lucky 6.9 20:15, 3 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Neither have I â I've only presented evidence â but I've been watching the main RFAr page for some time, and have a pretty good idea of how things go. The important things are to write a concise summary of the problem with the user, and to provide rock-solid, easy-to-read evidence so the arbitrators don't have to waste much time figuring out what to do. I'd make a copy of <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Template_4b41.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Template">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Template</a> in your user space somewhere. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="green">android</font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="purple">79</font></a> 20:25, September 3, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>With all due respect, I do believe as a member of the Comanche tribal roll, I know which term is preferred. The term "Native American" is offensive, as it is yet another way that white men try to erase our history. I know that some do this from ignorance, but some do it out of pure racism! I don't know which you fall into. I like to be called a Native American as much as a black person likes to be called a Negro.</p>
<p>Please see the following: <i>a 1996 survey revealed that more American Indians in the United States still <b>preferred American Indian</b> to Native American.</i> .</p>
<p>and the following:</p>
<p><i>Some American Indians have misgivings about the term Native American. Russell Means, a famous American Indian activist, opposes the term Native American because he believes it was imposed by the government without the consent of American Indians. [17] Furthermore, some American Indians question the term Native American because, they argue, it serves to ease the conscience of "white America" with regard to past injustices done to American Indians by effectively eliminating "Indians" from the present. [18] Still others (both Indians and non-Indians) argue that Native American is problematic because "native of" literally means "born in," so any person born in America is "native" to it.</i> <a href="../../../g/o/p/User%7EGOP904_0c83.html" title="User:GOP904">GOP904</a></p>

<p>No problem at all. This will be a battle that takes me way beyond <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">wikipedia</a>. Those who started the term <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_American_33b5.html" title="Native American">Native American</a> probably had good intentions. I believe it was done to help white people forget the "savage ways" of <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Indians_69b8.html" title="American Indians">American Indians</a>. Now it is being presented as a politically correct term to show sensitivity to <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indians.html" title="Indians">Indians</a>. It actually has the opposite affect.</p>
<p>How do I start presenting my case on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">wikipedia</a>? <a href="../../../g/o/p/User%7EGOP904_0c83.html" title="User:GOP904">GOP904</a></p>

<p>Congratulations on being made an admin! I thought you might like to know of a javascript tool that may help in your editing by giving easy access to many admin features. It's described at <a href="../../../t/o/o/Wikipedia%7ETools_Navigation_popups_4b08.html" title="Wikipedia:Tools/Navigation popups">Wikipedia:Tools/Navigation popups</a>. The quick version of the installation procedure for admins is to paste the following into User:Android79/TalkArchive008/monobook.js:</p>
<pre>
// [[User:Lupin/popups.js]] - please include this line 

document.write('&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="'

<p>I figured that since everyone's been so serious and a little high strung regarding vfd/afd I'd have a sense of humor about it and maybe even make a few editors laugh before it got reverted, granted even though it's a high traffic page I didn't expect it to be reverted so quickly.

<p>The article <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Dr%C3%B8bak_sound_55e1.html" title="Battle of DrÃ¸bak sound">Battle of DrÃ¸bak sound</a> was (I think) wrongly deleted. It is part of the WikiProject Battles and the series about <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_occupation_of_Norway_406c.html" title="Nazi occupation of Norway">Nazi occupation of Norway</a> (<a href="../../../c/a/m/Template%7ECampaignbox_Nazi_occupation_of_Norway_c9fe.html" title="Template:Campaignbox Nazi occupation of Norway">Template:Campaignbox Nazi occupation of Norway</a>). It was intended to be expanded by me today and since the event is so important I suspect others would have contributed as well. I also think at least one of the arguments I made on the talk page shold have counted for something. It is a hugely important event in Norwegian and European history(because it made it possible for the King and government to escape, enabling it, Norways gold reserve and large merchant fleet to fight for the allies), and of course it is the most important event of <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscarsborg_festning.html" title="Oscarsborg festning">Oscarsborg Fortress</a>. But the article about the fortress has to be seperate from the article about the event simply because the two things are different... I know the two articles are very similar now, but that will change.

<p>Kurt is a long-standing troll in IRC, mostly prone to either spamming the channel with random songlyrics or by being a vicious and trenchant <a href="../../../a/y/n/Ayn_Rand_c548.html" title="Ayn Rand">Randroid</a> with a negligible relationship with fact. (The point when he declared that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem was false was a particular treat.) On IRC, he's got a zero tolerance policy, whereby he is kicked the moment he irritates anybody. He was a fairly minor contributor to Wikipedia, but appears to have decided to adopt a parodically hardline inclusionist position and to be a troll about it. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 19:50, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>You don't seem to be voting delete for a real reason, what leads you to beleive this is a vanity page. I can easily confirm who I am as the owner of <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/sinstar" class="external text" title="http://livejournal.com/users/sinstar" rel="nofollow">this fan site</a>. I dont expect you to like me, accept the rudeness of Sin-thetik, but I would like to politely ask you to review the facts I have outlined in the discussion and reconsider changing your votes. I am willing to accept feedback and civily discuss this matter with you. You must understand how infuriating this is to me knowing all 3 meet the guidelines by 1 or 2 requirements in several areas of WP's rules.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Look the point summarized is</b> I am willing to work with you guys on why these were deleted but until now noone has given us any feedback and has even lied about stuff trying to get it deleted. All 3 of them meet the sufficient amount of requirements for <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, the guidelines in WP:Criteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies, <a href="../../../i/m/p/Wikipedia%7EImportance_0cbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Importance">Wikipedia:Importance</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> (the fact that <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide_girls.html" title="Suicide girls">suicide girls</a>, gidget gein, and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marilyn_manson.html" title="Marilyn manson">marilyn manson</a> are involved and can be verified in those links should proove that) , <a href="../../../f/a/m/Wikipedia%7EFame_and_importance_6184.html" title="Wikipedia:Fame and importance">Wikipedia:Fame_and_importance</a> mainly the part stating "There is clear proof that a reasonable number of people are or were concurrently interested in the subject (eg. it is at least well-known in a community)" If you can't tell the community of Myspace.com and Livejournal.com alone are enough to meet this criterea you are blind. If you do google searches, go to forums and search their names, or visit internet archives you can find un-disputable information on the band from reputable sources, first hand accounts that are years older than these discussions, and intangible archives kept by internet archives. IF you want more detail read my above rant, your right I do sound mad about this, because I can't see how you can say they do not meet criterea or that this is a vanity page. Please accept my apologies for anything you have taken to be rude and please re-consider changing your vote. What Harm could it do&#160;? BTW I am not trying to bully anyone, I can show you the location of the people threatening to come here and vandalize the hell out of Wikipedia. But I do not want that to be part of your decision at all. (please reference the large rebuttle on the discussion page itself)</li>
</ul>
<p>I have posted this, I hope that some of you will consider looking for my information and reconsider your vote for now. A lot of people are simply responding to the rudeness of user:sin-thetik and some things I said are being misconstrude as threats. I am simply upset because of all the time it took to write these 3 articles, knowing they fit the guidelines, only to have somone delete them with the proof and verifiable facts right in front of them .. just their un-willingness to read them. Please think it over, I appreciate your time. I'm just a fan girl trying to be the first to get an article up about them since I have been running a fan site about them for almost 2 years now.</p>

<p>I just wanted to thank you (sic) for speedily deleting my new article "Wikipedia Attention Geas". In the talk page I clearly stated it was my <i>first</i> contribution ever, and I also stated it was a protologism. You could have left a stub with comments about neologisms or transmedia or something helpfull for a person using Wikipedia for first time, but instead you left nothing. Also if you had bothered to check my user talk page I have a space for messages about things like this.</p>
<p>If the article was inappropiate in any way a small message about why might help me to <i>not make the same mistake</i> in my next 20 contributions.</p>

<p>Man this is almost as bad as IRC. If you could dump my article ("Wikipedia Attention Geas") into my User:Wiki Tiki God/Storage that would be swell. I thought if it was rejected I would have a day or two in order to make a copy. I don't think I'll be making too many submissions from here on out (but will still be an avid reader). Mostly I like language things like idioms, neologisms, coloquialisms, slang, techno jargon ecetera. None of these seems to be appropriate here (nor in Wiktionary.org either).

<dd>Yeah, it was just a typo with a missing decimal point. At first I thought it was nonsense vandalism too, and since I'd already gone to the user's contributions and found a string of country edits that looked like a a vandalism spree judging just from the history list, I mass-reverted them while loading up the diffs. A little careless of me but the server is tediously slow today (not that that justifies it). After the diffs came up I realised my mistake and mass-reverted myself again. The canada edit does need a little tuning though. Not sure if the number should be rounded or just decimal-pointed. Is there any guideline or manual of style angle to the matter? --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 14:59, 28 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I'd say we should leave it be (the original estimate and not FRED's edit) unless a source is provided.

I guess it's a matter of poor English and not silly vandalism â "32 270 507 millions" is 32,270,507,000,000, and since an anon had made similar edits earlier I only assumed the worst. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="green">android</font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="purple">79</font></a> 15:04, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, maybe I'm missing something, but I didn't think Kiddie Rape really fell under any of the criteria in <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion</a> for a speedy; I suppose the closest would be vandalism, but I don't think it was, really. (Don't get me wrong, I think it should be deleted, but I felt this was out of process.) <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 17:04, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>PS: I don't usually check other User_talk: pages (so that I don't have to monitor a whole long list of User_Talk: pages - one for each person with whom I am having a "conversation"), so please leave any messages for me on my talk page (above); if you leave a message for me here I probably will not see it. I know not everyone uses this style (they would rather keep all the text of a thread in one place), but I simply can't monitor all the User_talk: pages I leave messages on. Thanks!</p>

<dd><i>from a user whose only other contributions were vandalism .. given the other contributions, I felt it best to nuke the user's entire contribution history</i>: Well, as they say, even a broken clock is twice a day. I certainly would concur that a pattern of vandalism merits blocking, but even then I try and treat each edit separately. <i>If you feel it's a useful redirect</i>: No, as I said "Don't get me wrong, I think it should be deleted"; i.e. I agree it's not worth keeping. I just didn't think it merited speedying is all. Thanks for taking the time to respond to my concern. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 00:48, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Droid-- Thank you for the kind words and support concerning my RfA. Although I fear this may be headed toward "no consensus", I hope you will think about supporting me again in the future. You were right, Gabrielsimon brought out the worst in me, and I hope to never be that way again.

<p>Android79, it looks like you haven't being keeping with the times. It has long being decided that the "King of pop" &amp; "wacko jacko" tags will not be mentioned in the introductory section on the main article. The reason being they are minor 'stuff' and subject to POV.</p>

<p>I couldn't find it in the discussion page as I first thought. Either, It's there in the discussion page but I can't find it or I saw it somewhere else. That's why I said!</p>

<p>CONFIRM WITH THE JOURNALIST, IF YOU HAVE ANY DOUBTS!</p>
<p>Enough with the caps. I just asked Journalist, but he's not around, apparently. If it's not on the MJ discussion page, and never was, then it doesn't reflect consensus on the MJ article. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="green">android</font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="purple">79</font></a> 15:03, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

Hi, just got you message, Android79. I cant seem to remember discussing anything with 161.74.11.24 (<a href="../../../1/6/1/User_talk%7E161.74.11.24.html" title="User talk:161.74.11.24">talk</a> â¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_161.74.11.24_8cc3.html" title="Special:Contributions/161.74.11.24">contribs</a>). I dont even know this user, and I haven got a clue where he/she got it from.</p>
<p>There was this one time, however, when <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightscream_713e.html" title="User:Nightscream">Nightscream</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENightscream_7834.html" title="User talk:Nightscream">talk</a> â¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nightscream_ebe0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nightscream">contribs</a>) had tried to shorten the article but mistakenly messed it up âhe deleted some important info: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michael_Jackson&amp;oldid=20593086" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michael_Jackson&amp;oldid=20593086" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and I reverted his changes, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michael_Jackson&amp;oldid=20603664" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michael_Jackson&amp;oldid=20603664" rel="nofollow">rewrote the ontro</a> (but as you can see, Wacko Jacko and King of Pop are both included). That was the only time I had ever made any major contributions to the article, and I cant seem to remember discussing anything with this user. Maybe he has me confused. <a href="../../../j/o/u/User%7EJournalist_823c.html" title="User:Journalist"><font color="#000066">âJo<font color="#0000CC">urna<font color="#0033FF">list</font></font></font></a> <a href="../../../j/o/u/User_talk%7EJournalist_14df.html" title="User talk:Journalist"><font color="#0066FF">&gt;&gt;talk&lt;&lt;</font></a> 18:47, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This content is all true, if not well-known. I volunteered to submit the rap ensemble, Soup and Crakers into wikipedia. They are very well known throughout North Carolina. The dali lama comment is a joke from one of their songs, its for the fans. Thanks for the warnings, I'll clean up the page zackiscool</p>
