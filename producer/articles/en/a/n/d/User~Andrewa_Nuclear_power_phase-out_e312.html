<p>Belgium's nuclear phase-out legislation was agreed in July 1999 by the <a href="../../../f/l/e/Flemish_Liberals_and_Democrats_f7d3.html" title="Flemish Liberals and Democrats">Flemish Liberals and Democrats</a>-led Government including AGALEV (now <a href="../../../g/r/o/Groen%21.html" title="Groen!">Groen!</a>), the Belgian <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greens_party.html" title="Greens party">Greens party</a>. The phase-out law calls for each of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_nuclear_reactors.html#Belgium" title="List of nuclear reactors">Belgium's seven reactors</a> to close after 40 years of operation with no new reactors built subsequently. When the law was being passed, it was speculated it would be overturned again as soon as an administration without the Greens was in power.<sup><a href="http://www.scientific-alliance.org/pdf/essential_programme_to_underpin_government_policy_on_nuclear_power.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.scientific-alliance.org/pdf/essential_programme_to_underpin_government_policy_on_nuclear_power.pdf" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2003, a new government was elected without the Greens. In September of 2005, the government decided to partially overturn the previous decision, extending the phase-out period for another 20 years, with possible further extensions. It remains unknown if additional new nuclear plants will be built. The reason given for revoking the decision to shut Belgium's reactors is that it is unrealistic to expect to replace the electricity being generated by nuclear plants by alternative means. The only practical alternatives being massive production of new oil- or coal-fueled electricity plants or purchase the electricity abroad. The first option is not feasible due to restrictions imposed by the <a href="../../../k/y/o/Kyoto_Agreement_c3bb.html" title="Kyoto Agreement">Kyoto Agreement</a>, while the second has higher associated costs than continued operation of Belgium's nuclear plants.</p>
<p>In July 2005, the National Planning Bureau published a new report, which states that <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petroleum.html" title="Petroleum">oil</a> and other <a href="../../../f/o/s/Fossil_fuel.html" title="Fossil fuel">fossil fuels</a> generate 90% of Belgian <a href="../../../e/n/e/Energy.html" title="Energy">energy</a> use, while nuclear power accounts for 9% and <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renewable_energy.html" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a> for 1%. Note the fact, however, that electricity only amounts to 16% of total energy use, and while nuclear-powered electricity amounts to 9% of use in Belgium, in many parts of Belgium, especially in <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flanders.html" title="Flanders">Flanders</a>, it makes out more then 50% of the electricity provided to households and businesses. This was one of the major reasons to revert the earlier phase-out, since it was totally impossible to provide more then 50% of the electricity by 'alternative' energy-production, and a revert to the classical coal-driven electricity would mean it's totally impossible to adhere to the <a href="../../../k/y/o/Kyoto_Protocol_1811.html" title="Kyoto Protocol">Kyoto Protocol</a>.</p>
<p>It is projected that within 25 years renewable energy will increase to at most 5% of the energy use, because of high costs. The current plan of the <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgian_federal_government.html" title="Belgian federal government">Government</a> arranges for all nuclear power stations to shut down by 2025. The report raises concerns about <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greenhouse_gases.html" title="Greenhouse gases">greenhouse gases</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/s/Sustainability.html" title="Sustainability">sustainability</a>.<sup><a href="http://www.expatica.com/source/site_article.asp?subchannel_id=48&amp;story_id=21976&amp;name=Addicted+to+nuclear+energy%3F" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.expatica.com/source/site_article.asp?subchannel_id=48&amp;story_id=21976&amp;name=Addicted+to+nuclear+energy%3F" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>In 2000, the <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">German</a> government, consisting of the <a href="../../../s/p/d/SPD_ed50.html" title="SPD">SPD</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/l/Alliance_%2790_The_Greens_e25b.html" title="Alliance '90/The Greens">Alliance '90/The Greens</a> officially announced its intention to phase out the use of nuclear energy. <a href="../../../j/%C3%BC/r/J%C3%BCrgen_Trittin_0e44.html" title="Jürgen Trittin">Jürgen Trittin</a> (from the German <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greens.html" title="Greens">Greens</a>) as the Minister of Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, reached an agreement with energy companies on the gradual shut down of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_nuclear_reactors.html#Germany" title="List of nuclear reactors">the country's nineteen nuclear power plants</a> and a cessation of civil usage of nuclear power by 2020. This was enacted as the Nuclear Exit Law. Based on the calculation of 32 years as the usual time of operation for a nuclear power plant, the agreement precisely tells how much energy a power plant is allowed to produce before being closed down.</p>
<p>The power plants in <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stade.html" title="Stade">Stade</a> and Obrigheim were turned off (<a href="../../../n/o/v/November_14.html" title="November 14">November 14</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_11.html" title="May 11">May 11</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>) - their dismantling is scheduled to start in 2007.<sup><a href="http://www.terradaily.com/2003/031114130333.jlvf6wjx.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.terradaily.com/2003/031114130333.jlvf6wjx.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Anti-nuclear activists criticize the agreement: they think of it rather as a guarantee of operation than a nuclear power phase-out. They argued also the time limit for phase-out was too long and criticized the ban on building new commercially used nuclear power plants did not apply to scientifically used plants, which since had been put into operation (e.g. München II) and also not to stations for <a href="../../../e/n/r/Enriched_uranium.html" title="Enriched uranium">enrichment of uranium</a>, hence the enrichment station in Gronau has received permission to extend operations. Further, <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_reprocessing.html" title="Nuclear reprocessing">nuclear fuel reprocessing</a> was not immediately forbidden, but allowed instead until the middle of 2005.</p>
<p>Although, the <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_reactor.html" title="Nuclear reactor">reactors</a> in Obrigheim had been shut down, the dismantling of the plant will only begin in 2007. Therefore, it remains possible for the <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_federal_election%2C_2005.html" title="German federal election, 2005">newly elected</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Democratic_Union_3341.html" title="Christian Democratic Union">Christian Democratic Union</a>-headed government to restart the reactors.</p>
<p>An Renewable Energy Sources Act provided for a <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_tax_shift.html" title="Green tax shift">tax in support of renewable energy</a>. The German government, declaring <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greenhouse_effect.html" title="Greenhouse effect">climate protection</a> as a key policy issue, announced a <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbon_dioxide.html" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> reduction target by the year 2005 compared to 1990 by 25%.<sup><a href="http://www.agores.org/Publications/EnR/GermanyREPolicy2000.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.agores.org/Publications/EnR/GermanyREPolicy2000.pdf" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></sup>. In 1998, the use of renewables in Germany reached 284 <a href="../../../p/j/_/PJ_0b62.html" title="PJ">PJ</a> of primary energy demand, which corresponds to 5% of the total electricity demand. By 2010 the German Government wants to reach 10%.<sup><a href="http://www.scientific-alliance.org/pdf/essential_programme_to_underpin_government_policy_on_nuclear_power.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.scientific-alliance.org/pdf/essential_programme_to_underpin_government_policy_on_nuclear_power.pdf" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Anti-nuclear activists have argued the German government had been supportive of nuclear power by providing financial guarantees for energy providers. Also it has been pointed out, there were, as yet, no plans for the final storage of <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_waste.html" title="Nuclear waste">nuclear waste</a>. By tightening safety regulations increasing taxation, a faster end to nuclear power could had been forced. A gradual closing down of nuclear power plants had come along with concessions in questions of safety for the population with transports of nuclear waste throughout Germany.<sup><a href="http://www.pds-coesfeld.de/anti%20atom.gronau2.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pds-coesfeld.de/anti%20atom.gronau2.htm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></sup> This latter point has been disagreed with by the Minister of Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety.<sup><a href="http://www.bmu.de/english/nuclear_safety/doc/3420.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bmu.de/english/nuclear_safety/doc/3420.php" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Critics of a phase-out in Germany argue that nuclear power stations could not be compensated for, and predict an <a href="../../../e/n/e/Energy_crisis.html" title="Energy crisis">energy crisis</a>, or argue that only coal could possibly compensate for nuclear power and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions will increase tremendously (with the use of oil and fossils) and/or in energy imports either ironically of nuclear power from France or of natural gas from Russia, which is still not perceived as a safe partner.<sup><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4295389.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4295389.stm" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Because of increasing prices for <a href="../../../f/o/s/Fossil_fuel.html" title="Fossil fuel">fossil fuels</a>, arguments for a <i>phase-out of the phase-out</i> were again being discussed.

After that the Swedish parliament decided in 1980 that no further nuclear power plants should be built, and that a nuclear power phase-out should be completed by 2010. Some observers have condemned the referendum as flawed because people could only vote "NO to nuclear" although three options were basically harder or softer "NO".</p>
<p>After the 1986 <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chernobyl_accident.html" title="Chernobyl accident">Chernobyl accident</a> in <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukraine.html" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>, the question of security of nuclear energy was again called into question. In 1997 the <a href="../../../r/i/k/Riksdag.html" title="Riksdag">Riksdag</a>, the Swedish parliament, decided to shut down one of the <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_reactor.html" title="Nuclear reactor">reactors</a> at <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barseb%C3%A4ck_nuclear_power_plant.html" title="Barsebäck nuclear power plant">Barsebäck</a> by <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_1.html" title="July 1">July 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a> and the second before <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_1.html" title="July 1">July 1</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, although under the condition that their energy production would be compensated. The next conservative government tried to cancel the phase-out, but, after protests, did not cancel it but instead decided to extend the time limit to 2010. At Barsebäck, block 1 was shut down on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_30.html" title="November 30">November 30</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a> and block 2 on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_1.html" title="June 1">June 1</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>.</p>
<p>The nuclear energy phase-out is controversial in Sweden. It is feared that Sweden will lose its international competititiveness. The energy production of the remaining nuclear power plants has been considerably increased in recent years to compensate for the turn off of Barsebäck. In 1998, the government decided to build no further hydropower plants in order to protect national <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water_resources.html" title="Water resources">water resources</a>. In spite of extensive efforts to create alternatives to nuclear power, such as <a href="../../../f/o/s/Fossil_fuels.html" title="Fossil fuels">fossil fuels</a>, it is not likely that Sweden can complete the nuclear power phase-out by 2010. It has been estimated that <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_nuclear_reactors.html#Sweden" title="List of nuclear reactors">nuclear power plants in operation</a> will stay in operation until 2050.</p>
<p>In March 2005, an opinion poll with 1027 persons asked, showed 83% support for maintaining or increasing nuclear power.<sup><a href="http://www.uic.com.au/nip39.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.uic.com.au/nip39.htm" rel="nofollow">[19]</a></sup> Another poll in May that polled residents that lived around Barsebäck found that 94% wanted it to stay.

"Moratorium Plus" was for an extension of the moratorium for another 10 years, and additionally a condition to stop the present reactors after 40 years of operation. In order to extend the 40 years by 10 more years another referendum would have to be held (at high administrative costs).

<p>The main points in his argument are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Construction cost are unlikely to be recovered by operating the plant, with expected lifetime and revenue;</li>
<li>Costs of competing sources of energy, as oil, natural gas and coal should increase unrealistically for nuclear power to be competitive;</li>
<li>The plant fleet seldom operates at full power capacity, but only at a fraction (Paine reports 58% as typical), since some plants must periodically stop for safety controls. Increasing this percentage would therefore pose an inherent risk.</li>
<li>Summing up the numbers, nuclear power would be a marginally successful investment only in the most optimistic scenarios (maximum lifetime, technology improvement, uptime and energy prices).</li>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_Nuclear_power_phase-out_e312.html" title="Edit section: Insurance">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Insurance</span></h4>
<p>Nuclear power plants are not insured solely by private insurers. As of 2005 the maximum amount of purchaseable insurance available was believed by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_of_America_8a5e.html" title="United States of America">US</a> government to be $300 million - the risks of a severe nuclear accident could be much greater (although <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_Mile_Island_41ed.html" title="Three Mile Island">Three Mile Island</a> was not). Therefore, some governments provide support for insurance (see for example the US's <a href="../../../p/r/i/Price-Anderson_Nuclear_Industries_Indemnity_Act_cde7.html" title="Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act">Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act</a>, discussed below). This practice is similar to that for banks, which are also backed with government guarantees.</p>
<p>The Price-Anderson Act - the world's first comprehensive nuclear liability law - has since 1957 been central to addressing the question of liability for nuclear accidents. It is renewed every ten years or so, with strong bipartisan support, and requires individual operators to be responsible for two layers of insurance cover: The first layer is where each nuclear site is required to purchase US$ 300 million coverage from private insurers. The second layer if required is jointly provided by all US reactor operators - this layer is funded through retrospective payments of up to $96 million per reactor collected in annual instalments of $15 million (and adjusted with inflation). Combined, the total provision comes to over $10 billion paid for by the utilities. (The Dept. of Energy provides $9.5 billion for its nuclear activities.) Beyond this coverage and irrespective of fault, Congress, as insurer of last resort, must decide how compensation is provided in the event claims exceed the $10 billion. In 2005, the Act was renewed again by Congress as part of the <a href="../../../e/n/e/Energy_Policy_Act_of_2005_dbcc.html" title="Energy Policy Act of 2005">Energy Policy Act of 2005</a>.</p>
<p>A criticism occasionally made is that over 40 years of research has failed to produce an industry which is safe enough to afford the costs of its own insurance. However, inherently-safe designs such as the <a href="../../../p/e/b/Pebble_bed_reactor.html" title="Pebble bed reactor">Pebble Bed Modular Reactor</a> should address this.</p>

<p>The long-term <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radioactive_waste.html" title="Radioactive waste">radioactive waste</a> storage problems of nuclear power have not been fully solved. Several countries have considered using underground repositories. Nuclear waste takes up little space compared to wastes from the chemical industry which remain toxic indefinitely.<sup><a href="http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf04.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf04.htm" rel="nofollow">[62]</a></sup> Spent fuel rods are now stored in concrete casks close to the nuclear reactors.<sup><a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.02/nuclear.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.02/nuclear.html" rel="nofollow">[63]</a></sup> The amounts of waste can be reduced in several ways.

<p>It has also not been decided in some countries who should pay for the supervision of areas where nuclear waste is stored. At the moment it seems likely, at least in Germany, that the state will pay for the costs caused by direct waste (burned rods), contaminated materials from power plants and from the extraction of <a href="../../../p/l/u/Plutonium.html" title="Plutonium">plutonium</a> and <a href="../../../u/r/a/Uranium.html" title="Uranium">uranium</a>, as well as other nuclear waste, and costs for storage of <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_waste.html" title="Nuclear waste">contaminated waste</a>, because the industry has insufficient resources.<sup><a href="http://www.bmu.de/atomenergie/doc/7020.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bmu.de/atomenergie/doc/7020.php" rel="nofollow">[65]</a></sup> In the US, utility companies pay a fixed fee per kilowatt-hour into a disposal fund administered by the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Energy_93c1.html" title="Department of Energy">Department of Energy</a>.</p>

<p>Another argument against nuclear energy is the potential for close connection of civil and military usage (which in most countries are kept strictly separate). In manufacturing nuclear fuel rods, the fraction of the fissile uranium isotope 235 has to be (except in <a href="../../../c/a/n/CANDU_reactor_6498.html" title="CANDU reactor">CANDU reactors</a>) increased from the natural fraction from 0.7 to 5% in order to be able to create a chain reaction. A station for the enrichment of uranium (e.g. the German station at <a href="../../../g/r/o/Gronau.html" title="Gronau">Gronau</a>) could—with extreme difficulty—increase the amount of <a href="../../../u/-/2/U-235.html" title="U-235">U-235</a> to above 80% so it could be used in a <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_weapon.html" title="Nuclear weapon">weapon</a>. Therefore, some of the techniques of uranium enrichment are kept secret (e.g. <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gaseous_diffusion.html" title="Gaseous diffusion">gaseous diffusion</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gas_centrifuge.html" title="Gas centrifuge">gas centrifuge</a>, <a href="../../../a/v/l/AVLIS_769e.html" title="AVLIS">AVLIS</a> and <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_reprocessing.html" title="Nuclear reprocessing">nuclear reprocessing</a>).</p>
<p>Opponents of nuclear power argue that it is not possible to discriminate between civil and military usage, and therefore that nuclear power contributes to the proliferation of nuclear weapons. While it is possible to operate a nuclear power plant with non-weaponized materials, having a reactor brings with it access to materials and facilities which can be used in special low burn military reactors and reprocesed into Plutonium which is the required ingredient for building a high yield <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_weapon.html" title="Nuclear weapon">nuclear weapon</a>. <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Korea_2774.html" title="North Korea">North Korea</a>, and <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a> (which later gave up its nuclear weapons) all started "peaceful" nuclear power programs with research reactors that were later used to make weapons-grade plutonium, and there is great concern that <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iran</a>'s program has a similar goal, to enrich uranium to weapons-grade. <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>, <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iran</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Korea_2774.html" title="North Korea">North Korea</a><sup><a href="http://www.iaea.org/programmes/a2/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iaea.org/programmes/a2/index.html" rel="nofollow">[66]</a></sup><sup><a href="http://www.world-nuclear.org/wgs/decom/database/php/qry_reactorsdb_region_test.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.world-nuclear.org/wgs/decom/database/php/qry_reactorsdb_region_test.php" rel="nofollow">[67]</a></sup> do not have nuclear power plants at present, while <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a> started up its power plant long after acquiring nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Design and construction of nuclear explosives based on normal reactor-grade plutonium would be difficult and unreliable, and has not so far been done.<sup><a href="http://www.expatica.com/source/site_article.asp?subchannel_id=48&amp;story_id=22623&amp;name=Anti-nuclear+activists+arrested+at+military+base" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.expatica.com/source/site_article.asp?subchannel_id=48&amp;story_id=22623&amp;name=Anti-nuclear+activists+arrested+at+military+base" rel="nofollow">[68]</a></sup><sup><a href="http://www.world-nuclear.org/education/ne/ne7.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.world-nuclear.org/education/ne/ne7.htm" rel="nofollow">[69]</a></sup></p>
<p>Much popular concern about possible weapons proliferation arises from considering the fissile materials themselves. For instance, in relation to the plutonium contained in spent fuel discharged each year from the world's commercial nuclear power reactors, it is correctly but misleadingly asserted that "only a few kilograms of plutonium are required to make a bomb". Furthermore, no nation is without enough indigenous uranium to construct a few weapons (however, that uranium would have to be enriched).</p>
<p><a href="../../../p/l/u/Plutonium.html" title="Plutonium">Plutonium</a> is a substance of varying properties depending on its source. It consists of several different isotopes, including Pu-238, Pu-239, Pu-240, and Pu-241. All of these are "plutonium" but not all are fissile - only Pu-239 and Pu-241 can undergo fission in a normal reactor. Plutonium-239 by itself is an excellent nuclear fuel. It has also been used extensively for nuclear weapons because it has a relatively low spontaneous fission rate and a low critical mass. Consequently plutonium-239, with only a few percent of the other isotopes present, is often called "weapons-grade" plutonium. This was used in the <a href="../../../f/a/t/Fat_Man_555c.html" title="Fat Man">Nagasaki bomb</a> in 1945 and in many other <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_weapon.html" title="Nuclear weapon">nuclear weapons</a>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, "reactor-grade" plutonium as routinely produced in all commercial nuclear power reactors, and which may be separated by reprocessing the spent fuel from them, is not the same thing at all. It contains a large proportion - up to 40% - of the heavier plutonium isotopes, especially Pu-240, due to it having remained in the reactor for a relatively long time. This is not a particular problem for re-use of the plutonium in mixed oxide (MOX) fuel for reactors, but it seriously affects the suitability of the material for nuclear weapons. Due to spontaneous fission of Pu-240, only a very low level of it is tolerable in material for making weapons. Design and construction of nuclear explosives based on normal reactor-grade plutonium would be difficult and unreliable, and has not so far been done.<sup><a href="http://www.world-nuclear.org/education/ne/ne7.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.world-nuclear.org/education/ne/ne7.htm" rel="nofollow">[70]</a></sup></p>

<p>Nuclear reactors do not emit greenhouse gasses or ash during normal operation; however the mining and processing of uranium involves emissions. Emissions that arise from whole life cycle are well comparable to wind energy.<sup><a href="http://www.world-nuclear.org/education/ne/ne6.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.world-nuclear.org/education/ne/ne6.htm" rel="nofollow">[76]</a></sup> Nuclear reactors and other types of power plants raise the temperature of the rivers used to cool them, which can pose a health hazard for fish in certain eco systems.

This can be greatly reduced by using <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cooling_tower.html" title="Cooling tower">cooling towers</a>, which are deployed in places where excessive warming is deemed unacceptable. All waste products are contained and stored. This is opposite to other energy sources (e.g. Coal, Gas, Oil) where pollution is pumped directly into atmosphere. Without [Nuclear Power Plants] [USA] would have released nearly 700 million metric tons more carbon dioxide into the air each year.

<p>According to antinuclear activists, leakages of radioactive contamination put the safety of NPPs in general into question. It is also feared, nuclear power plants with their contamination are a health hazard. To counter these concerns all nuclear operators are obliged to measure radiation on and around their sites as well to report all particles and radiation they emit. This has to be attested by an independent audit office. This practice is more less the same in all countries that are members of <a href="../../../i/a/e/IAEA_43be.html" title="IAEA">IAEA</a>.

<p>An argument for proponents of nuclear power is <a href="../../../e/n/e/Energy_economics.html" title="Energy economics">energy economics</a>. They state that nuclear energy is the only power source which explicitly factors the estimated costs for waste containment and plant decommissioning into its overall cost, and that the quoted cost of <a href="../../../f/o/s/Fossil_fuel.html" title="Fossil fuel">fossil fuel</a> plants is deceptively low for this reason. Advocates of nuclear power argue that nuclear power is a cost-competitive and environmentally friendly way to produce energy versus fossil fuels when taking into account <a href="../../../e/x/t/Externality.html" title="Externality">externalities</a> associated with both forms of energy production.<sup><a href="http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf02.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf02.htm" rel="nofollow">[91]</a></sup></p>
<p>Also, nuclear power has a high energy return on energy investment (<a href="../../../e/r/o/EROI_2845.html" title="EROI">EROI</a>). Using life cycle analysis, it takes 4 to 5 months of energy production from the nuclear plant to fully pay back the initial energy investment.<sup><a href="http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf11.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf11.htm" rel="nofollow">[92]</a></sup> Advocates also claim that it is possible to relatively rapidly increase the number of plants. Typical new reactor designs have a construction time of three to four years.<sup><a href="http://www.uic.com.au/nip16.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.uic.com.au/nip16.htm" rel="nofollow">[93]</a></sup></p>
<p>In some places, especially where the <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coal_mining.html" title="Coal mining">coal mines</a> are far away from the plants, nuclear is cheaper, and in others it is roughly the same price or more expensive. The same comparisons can be made with gas and oil. However the <a href="../../../k/y/o/Kyoto_protocol.html" title="Kyoto protocol">Kyoto protocol</a> requires all polluters to pay for the right to pollute and that could make nuclear even more competitive. Also nuclear power has one of the lowest external costs, i.e. cost to the environment and people.<sup><a href="http://www.externe.info/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.externe.info/" rel="nofollow">[94]</a></sup> These are not factored into price but are paid by society and will partly be included by the <a href="../../../k/y/o/Kyoto_protocol.html" title="Kyoto protocol">Kyoto protocol</a>. In the UK for example nuclear external costs are 0.25 euro cents per kWh. That is a bit more than for wind which is rated at 0.15 euro cents per kWh, but considerably less than for coal which is at 4 to 7 euro cents per kWh, oil which is 3 to 5 euro cents per kWh, gas which is 1 to 2 euro cents per kWh and biomass which is at 1 euro cents per kWh. In other European countries it is more or less the same.<sup><a href="http://www.externe.info/results.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.externe.info/results.html" rel="nofollow">[95]</a></sup></p>
<p>Also, the cost of many renewables would be increased if they included necessary back-up power sources due to their intermittent nature. It has been calculated that <a href="../../../w/i/n/Wind_power.html" title="Wind power">wind power</a>, one of the major hopes for proponents of the phase-out, costs three times as much as average electricity in Germany.<sup><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4295389.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4295389.stm" rel="nofollow">[96]</a></sup></p>

<p>Proponents of nuclear energy state nuclear plants are safe and protected against attacks. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Containment_building.html" title="Containment building">Containment buildings</a> are strongly reinforced and highly guarded (see <a href="http://www.goshen.edu/bio/Biol410/BSSPapers98/schrock/schrock.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.goshen.edu/bio/Biol410/BSSPapers98/schrock/schrock.html" rel="nofollow">[98]</a> and <a href="http://www.world-nuclear.org/news/resistance.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.world-nuclear.org/news/resistance.htm" rel="nofollow">[99]</a>). <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a>, the President of the <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_f75d.html" title="USA">USA</a>, called <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_power.html" title="Nuclear power">nuclear power</a> one of America's safest energy sources in his speech about energy policy.<sup><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/06/20050622.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/06/20050622.html" rel="nofollow">[100]</a></sup></p>
<p>Proponents of nuclear power also believe that the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chernobyl_accident.html" title="Chernobyl accident">Chernobyl accident</a> was unique and occurred only because of a combination of poor design and unauthorized tests - also, the Chernobyl reactors did not have full containment buildings. They point out that no such accidents have occurred in Western reactors, which are now by far the most common design. A commonly cited example is the <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_Mile_Island_41ed.html" title="Three Mile Island">Three Mile Island</a> accident, which did not release significant amounts of radioactive particles despite a <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_meltdown.html" title="Nuclear meltdown">nuclear meltdown</a> comparable in magnitude to Chernobyl; this is attributed to better design and containment at Three Mile Island. These are the only major accidents in civilian nuclear power plant accidents.<sup><a href="http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf06.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf06.htm" rel="nofollow">[101]</a></sup></p>
<p>Proponents of nuclear energy also point out the great safety level for workers in the industry. Nuclear power resulted in 8 immediate deaths per TWy of electricity. That is significantly lower than the figure for <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coal.html" title="Coal">Coal</a> 342, <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_Gas_a9ce.html" title="Natural Gas">Natural Gas</a> 85, and <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydro.html" title="Hydro">Hydro</a> 883. Data is gathered in period 1970-1992.<sup><a href="http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf06.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf06.htm" rel="nofollow">[102]</a></sup></p>
