<p>Is it worth while mentioning the possible influence of Barbara Kruger's work on the OBEY posters/stencils? This article here <a href="http://www.loudpapermag.com/article.php?id=10" class="external free" title="http://www.loudpapermag.com/article.php?id=10" rel="nofollow">http://www.loudpapermag.com/article.php?id=10</a> mentions her influence on Fairey.</p>
<p>Also, I believe that if this article is to be cleaned up, there doesn't necessarily need to be an explanation of why Andre the Giant was chosen, but perhaps a link/better explanation of the concept of memes.</p>
<p>_______</p>
<p><br />
Though this certainly isn't the most concise or well-written article on Wikipedia, I don't believe that the cleanup tag is necessary. I'm going to delete it; perhaps whoever posted the tag originally can correct whichever parts they saw as messy or erroneous. --<a href="../../../b/u/m/User%7EBumhoolery_5def.html" title="User:Bumhoolery">Bumhoolery</a> 06:14, August 18, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I still don't get what the entire "Andre the Giant Has a Posse" is all about. Someone please give me a satisfying answer. Why did they choose Andre for this pop culture Icon? Because he was a giant? What do they mean by posse? Where they fans of the Wrestler?</p>
<p>I find it frustrating that this icon has become so popular yet no one can explain what the hell it even has to do with any foundation in logic.</p>
<p>I agree, I'm going to put up a cleanup - confusion - tag and ask that someone who knows to edit this article so that it is actually clear just what it's about. It's very frustrating to read an article and by the end still have no idea what's going on <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGraphia_600c.html" title="User:Graphia">Graphia</a> 06:58, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The Batman factoid bothers me because the film came out in 1989, the same year cited in the creation of the meme. I've also reviewed the Batplane scene and saw no Giant faces on any buildings. I'm not deleting the mention of Batman in the entry because I might be missing something, but it is very unlikely that the meme would be in a blockbuster film shot in England the same year it was created by students in Rhode Island.</p>
<p>I agree, I'm changing the movie reference to Batman Forever, based on a a few mentions on the internet. Could somebody who has Batman Forever on DVD please confirm? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheinfo_0d45.html" title="User:Theinfo">Theinfo</a> 04:32, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>"I realized that a lot of people didn't know what it was about," he explains later, during an interview at Black Market Design, the successful graphic arts firm he co-owns in San Diego. "But they liked it because they knew that the conservative people hated it. Initially, I wanted to elevate Andre out of the wrestling subculture to be on par with more mainstream cultural icons. That was the coup -- to raise Andre out of a subculture he should be embedded in."</p>
<p>"Even my very first print ad in 1992 was a picture of Elvis with 'Big' underneath and then a picture of Andre with the word 'Giant.' So it was saying that Andre is bigger than Elvis. I also did a shirt called 'The Famous Dead People Shirt,' which was a grid of nine people with Marilyn Monroe, James Dean, Jim Morrison, Bob Marley, Sid Vicious and Andre the last one in the corner."</p>

<p>Seeing as how I am regularly listed on this page, I check back on it now and again. I am blown away by the little things that people know about this, that I thought only I knew. (And the stuff that I have to correct, but that's no surprise.)</p>
<p>Anyhow, Barbara Kruger <i>should</i> get proper credit for her influence on Shepard's work, post-'93. The original OBEY sticker is a direct nod to her work, and Kruger's work is so influential with so few people realizing it, that it deserves credit here. I seem to remember an interview where he comes out and gives her due credit.</p>
<p>Yep, here it is.</p>

<p>"I also remember going to New York in 1990, a year after I started making the original Andre stickers, and seeing all the graffiti on the freeways, and what lengths people were going to, to get up some impressive pieces. That's one of the things that made me want to do bigger stuff. Barbara Kruger, also. Her really bold, powerful combination of images and type heavily influenced me. The idea of maximizing your communication in something you can look at for a split second."</p>

<p>Shouldn't the main article here be the OBEY campaign and "Andre the giant has a posse" just part of that... I mean these days, Obey is a much bigger thing...</p>
<p><br />
I completely agree. Obey Giant is so much more than this one image. Shepard Fairey has created over 380 prints for the Obey Giant campaign. It is after all obeygiant.com . If we moved this to Obey Giant, or Obey, we could include so much more, including toys, clothing, prints, gallery /fine art and more.</p>

<p>This area is a little absurd. There are just too many. If we want to keep this, I think we should keep the major ones. This is taking up valuable space that could be used for real information. This article covers less than 1% of what Obey Giant is today.</p>

<p>If we want to keep this article titled "André the Giant Has a Posse", I think we need to make an new article called "Obey Giant". Obey Giant is so much more than this now.

<p>I have always read that the Andre the Giant Has a Posse sticker was an original design, and not necessarily a spoof of anything; however, ever since I first saw it I knew it was a coy reference to something, although I couldn't put two and two together.</p>
<p>Then I came across this old flyer from the 60's about Lee Harvey Oswald. I am almost certain that this was the source of the campaign, but I can't seem to find any information about the Oswald flyer. I placed a graphic of it on the main page but I would like to know if anyone can pinpoint the source of the Oswald flyer, and if the artist behind Obey Giant has ever referred to it. I suspect it's relatively obscure and the 60's were before my time so maybe an older contributer can help me out here. Thanks.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>- <i>In Response:</i> The "flyer" you posted here does use a modified version of Lee Harvey Oswald's mug shot (which can be seen unedited <a href="http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/oswald.htm" class="external text" title="http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/oswald.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>), but I'm 99% sure that the text was added to mimic the Andre the Giant Has a Posse sticker. Take away that text and you're left with little to compare. This Lee Harvey Oswald poster does seem to fit the style of the many Andre/Posse spin-offs and parodies. It seems to work more in that direction than the other way around. That is to say, it would be a better fit if this image you've found were a parody of the Andre/Posse poster rather than an inspiration for it. If the latter were true, then the Andre/Posse poster would bear a much more obvious resemblance. The original Lee Harvey Oswald mugshot was of better quality, as one can see in the link above or by simply checking the Lee Harvey Oswald article; the "patsy" version seems to have deliberately been degrated in quality to more closely resemble the original Andre/Posse image. Of course, this is all deduction, I know not if the poster you put on here actually did exist some 40 years ago. I think it's less likely that it was a decades-old inspiration and far more likely that it's one of many, many parodies that surfaced after the original Andre campaign took flight. -'tero</p>

<dd>Actually, you're wrong&#160;:). That picture you linked is definitely <b>not</b> OBEY, and it definitely looks more like <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%281984%29_6929.html" title="Big Brother (1984)">Big Brother</a>. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStalefries_e401.html" title="User:Stalefries">Stale Fries</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/t/a/User_talk%7EStalefries_4758.html" title="User talk:Stalefries">taste better</a></sup></small> 04:34, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Again... I hate to do this. But you must no be looking at the pic, or your brighness is up too high. There is even an obey star (with andre's face in it) on his forehead (in the shirt). If you cant see it, take it in photoshop and change the levels. It is there 100%.</p>

<p>It definitely is an Obey shirt.</p>
