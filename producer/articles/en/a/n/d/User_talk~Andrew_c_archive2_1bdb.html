<p>By the way, I think Rich Farnbrough has a long term plan; he wants 36,000 articles, one for each verse. Creating the Matthew redirects is step 1, step 2 is to change them from redirects to articles - no-one will notice as they won't show up in the article creation logs, and there are too many to simply watch. <a href="../../../c/l/i/User%7EClinkophonist_b598.html" title="User:Clinkophonist">Clinkophonist</a> 20:18, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Andrew, I noticed the change you made to the dates for the Sacred Heart. I used the format that now appears in <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corpus_Christi_40eb.html" title="Corpus Christi">Corpus Christi</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pentecost.html" title="Pentecost">Pentecost</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity_Sunday_1117.html" title="Trinity Sunday">Trinity Sunday</a> and possibly other <i>Easter based</i> feasts as well. I was attempting a bit of standardisation. If we have a table in Sacred Heart then it would be good to have the same format in these other articles, or use the format in the other articles in Sacred Heart as I did. I'm also unsure why you removed the earliest and latest possible dates. While such facts are not directly relevant to the christian celebration, they are relevant to the topic as a whole, and they do represent useful content.

<dd>Sorry - just looked again at your edit. I didn't realise you'd moved the text noted above to a different article. Is there a case for merging the Feast article and the main article - what do you think? <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcturus_dd0a.html" title="User:Arcturus">Arcturus</a> 23:01, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is the first time I've attempted to use another user's talk page, please correct me if I'm messing it up.&#160;:) Regarding the page on Biblical Inerrecny.. I wanted to direct you to the discussion page where I have made an entry for each major edition, please feel free to discuss any improper editing I've done there.. however I feel as if I've been presenting the current scholarly view on the subject only to be reverted to your understanding or opinion on it. Don't get me wrong I'm not assuming anything about your thoughts, only making the observation that what you keep replacing my wrigints with is not consistent with the current stances of adherents to biblical inerrency which is what I undestood the purpose of that article to be. If you disagree.. I welcome you to create a page entitled "critism to inerrency" or some such page and make a comment on the article linking the reader to it. So please take a look at the discussion page. I've previously addressed all the issues and would welcome your thoughts in there.

Dear Andrew,</p>
<p>I see that you are a VCU graduate. I also attended VCU, lived in the Fan on Park, Floyd and Lombardy. I also have a nephew there now working on his BFA in photography. I was and he is a parishioner at Cathedral Parish (Sacred Heart Cathedral). Those were fine days for me and seeing your user page has brought back good memories of the Village Cafe, Carey Street and shows at the Byrd.</p>
<p>It has also reminded me of some of the worst anti-Catholicism I have ever experienced. In my years there the Cathedral was vandalized by the Jack Chick people when they glued hate posters to the front doors and by ACT UP when they spray painted lewd images on the limestone walls on Good Friday night. We also had several cases of Evangelicals interupting the the Eucharistic Prayer during the mass by walking up and down the aisles yelling and holding up Bibles. Personally, my boss once told me to wash my face on Ash Wednesday or get fired. I quit.</p>
<p>You are now part of the campaign to erradicate the name of the Catholic Church on WP. This is a complex issue and I would request that you see this page before you continue with such efforts: <a href="../../../v/a/q/User%7EVaquero100_Catholic_Church_naming_arguments_db1b.html" title="User:Vaquero100/Catholic Church naming arguments">CC vs. RCC</a>.</p>

I want to impress that I am, as best I can, wholly interested in being reasonable, subtle, and patient. To note, I have not made any changes at all to the article yet.

<p>Andrew c, I would not dispute your right to edit topics related to the CC. However, your obsession with the subject when you have such limited knowledge of the subject, is indeed perplexing. You seem to have a need to tinker and get your finger prints all over the place without making significant contributions of additional material. May I ask what your motivation is? <a href="../../../v/a/q/User%7EVaquero100_66a7.html" title="User:Vaquero100">Vaquero100</a> 18:23, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Earlier you said you were not contrarying me, but it appears that you are. In fact, you have added the word <i>Roman</i> to close to a hundred articles. I am not going out of my way to make the subtractions but if I am editing an article for other reasons (as in the case of English Reformation) and there is reason to remove "Roman" as was explained in my notes, I will make the changes. Follow my every move if you will, it just shows how obsessed you are with me personally or with Catholicism, which you showed no interest in before July 1. It is also clear that you are not as familiar with Catholic related topics as you ought to be to be spending so much time telling everyone else how it all should be. <a href="../../../v/a/q/User%7EVaquero100_66a7.html" title="User:Vaquero100">Vaquero100</a> 18:35, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I did not say anything about being ordained, you did. Ordination does not confer either intelligence or knowledge. However, a degree in a topic does, or at least some well selected general reading. You also did not seem to read closely my edits on English Reformation. And you do seem to be following me around, or else by what coincidence do I owe your commentary on my edits regarding Henry, the founder of the Anglican church?</p>
<p>Also, it is not just your Roman additions, it is the protracted debate over <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_devotions.html" title="Catholic devotions">Catholic devotions</a>, your trouble with my removal of "Roman" from the English Reformation (which were pre-Reformation references prior to the existence of the term <i>Roman Catholic Church</i>) and this protracted debate over His Holiness. It is just tiring to have educate you (when you always seem to assume I dont know what Im talking about) in order to make even minor edits to WP. <a href="../../../v/a/q/User%7EVaquero100_66a7.html" title="User:Vaquero100">Vaquero100</a> 19:02, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Several paragraphs of Dei Verbum were included to get the point across as to the PRECISE position of the Catholic Church on the Bible. Your edit makes it appear that the Church holds a position other than the precise position. Maybe it can be paraphrased several years from now, but until then, it should be left there until Catholics understand the official position of the Church so they do not contribute to Biblical inerrant nonsense. If you object to its relevance at this time, please note that about one in six people in the world are Catholic.

<p>Hi Andrew. Vaquero is a bit of a firebrand who supports the use of Catholic Church over Roman Catholic Church. He is a Catholic priest. I am a Catholic. I also support the use of the term Catholic Church so I sympathise with his position. Having said that, I also understand that for practical reasons in the Wikipedia we use Roman Catholic Church. This has been discussed at length and I support the consensus.

<p>re citations i_just_haven't_had_time to format them all (if you notice i did format one) so it's not a matter of not doing it it's a matter of when--no one else has to (although editing is collaborative, and just like people correct each other's typos/research errors, they correct each other's citations). calling it "sloppy" and accusing me of making work for other people on purpose sort of implies that everyone who contributes to an article which is later improved by someone else is being "sloppy" and "making work" for them. that's the whole point of wikipedia--collaboratively improving on each others' work. including your rather snippy crits of other peoples' editing (re anonymity, refs) with other comments about the subject and in the general discussion page does appear hostile, whether you intend for it to look that way or not. (whomever anonymous was seems to have been intimidated away.) i'm not convinced at all that your "nitpicking" isn't pov-motivated, based on your response to anonymous regarding the research done on the article (you were adamant that it was thorough/it definitely was not/ the whole article was framed as prochoice/prolife debate, rather than an informative encyclopedia article--it had zero scientific/medical refs). and while we're on the subject of bad citations, my pet peeve is broken links. but if you notice, i don't whine about them, i replace them myself...(furthermore, i like the articles that have in-line links better than footnotes, because you can go straight to the article without an intervening step, although i agree the formatting should be standard/articles should end up with footnotes links, etc). having a temporary link hardly degrades the quality of the article--it holds the link till formatting and can be more convenient). meanwhile i could have formatted ALL the links in the time wasted today addressing what i consider your whining/harassment (and so could have you). <a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 00:34, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>you seem to have lost all perspective on the importance of citations and in fact appear extremely emotionally invested in having a conflict about them--your concern is not collaborative, constructive, problem-solving-oriented, or even remotely patient--you seem bent only on harping on it in a very grudging, highly subjective way (which makes me feel like formatting zilch, by the way.) nevertheless, when i have time, i will. i think you should 1) clearly prioritize your gripes--a) make sure a petty technical gripe or opinion is separate from a topic discussion b) be more patient and try to at least seem like you are not zealous to cite people who disagree with you for "petty violations" that are unintentional. <a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 03:42, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Based on some of your comments (in multiple places), it seems like you hold resentment against me personally for what you see to be the poor state of the Mifepristone article before you arrived. I do not own the article (nor does anyone). I only edited the article 15 times before you arrived, and 9 of them were to rv vandalism. The rest were to reference, fix, and format current event information that was inserted by other editors into the article, plus a major rework of the drug infobox. That's it. Just about every edit of mine had to deal with the recent edits of other editors, not creating or editing the text that was already there. I seriously think you have contributed in a major way to the article, especially in different ways that my 15 contribution. And I seriously appreciate much of your efforts. But please do not blame me for the previous state of the article. An aside: I also take offense at your partisan accusations on my motivations and editing behavior. If there is something you'd like me to address or know, please tell me on my talk page, but I'd urge you to please keep personal speculations about me out of content/policy disputes.

<p>your contributions, since i began contributing, have only been recative to me. (i.e., you haven't contributed any research, changed/improved the article by editing any contributions that existed before i began editing.) your quick and frequent contributions to the talk page would indicate that you are concerned with the article...and yet your concern does not seem to be focused on the article, but rather on reacting to me. i think maybe you should try to take an objective look at every contribution you have made to the article since i began contributing--try to do a little outside analysis, as if you were someone else. i.e., i'm not saying you wrote the whole article, i'm saying you're very actively contributing to it...but only reactively, to the talk page--not to flaws in the article and how to improve them. you don't have a collective/collaborative attitude--if you object to something, it's only to edits i made, and you don't improve anything yourself--you bring complaints to the talkpage immediately, and hurl ridiculous accusations if you think you have the flimsiest grounds (plagiarism, for example. i laughed out loud and tried to remind myself that you are a student, not to take the bait.)</p>
<p>your insistence on keeping the PSA=prolife refuted by prochoice APA really seems to me like something you might not have insight into yet. you're obviously not stupid, so your inability to get what a straw man argument is --and how that was set up as one --would seem to involve some other kind of blinder. also your lack of perspective about citation issue, mortality rate--excessive, emotionally invested nitpicking which is not really focused on improving the article, but on being contentious because you think there's a rule you can invoke and use as a weapon towards an opponent. but the rules are not meant to be weapons, and i am not your opponent. (careful again never to conflate your opinion with the rules overconfidently, especially when you're subjectively and emotionally engaged. anyone with a legal education could tell you even laws are living interpretation, ever growing with new case law interpretations...)</p>
<p>i can see--i have read them--that many of the prolife arguments are laughably logically flawed/very ridiculously biased. i can see that many of the abortion pages have been vandalized, and that being prochoice and defending against "idiot vandals" could have been annoying...but also satisfying, in a way. as long as everyone who objects to your point of view is an "idiot vandal," one can feel very comfortably self-righteous.</p>
<p>i can see how having someone critically edit the article who is not an idiot vandal could puncture complacent self-righteousness, make people defensive and mad; how an accuracy audit of the article may not be perceived as an accuracy audit of the article, but an attack--and not just on the prochoice position, but on the egos of editors who thought their position was the moral high ground. whether that is the case for you or not, i think you need to expend at least one tenth of the energy you spend reacting to me thinking about why you are so reactive to me, and to practice more self control. for example, before you react to me, ask yourself questions such as, how will this improve the article? is there a better way to improve the article? etc. <a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 22:27, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey thanks for doing the really decent thing and letting everyone who may be interested including myself know that you have put an article up for a move. If you want to have any credibility in this discussion, you will extend some basic human courtesy. Having failed that, your contributions will suffer from a perceived, if not real, anti-Catholicism. Though I have had my suspicions, at moments you have made me think that your work on Catholic topics was in a cooperative spirit. Now I see I was made the fool in those moments and my previous instincts were correct. That is disappointing, but not at all surprising. Anyway, I've been fooled once--but will not be again.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">primary/secondary sources in sci/med</span></h2>
<p>here's what it actually says, in "Reliable Sources," by the way:</p>
<p><br />
"In science, avoid citing the popular press</p>
<p>The popular press generally does not cover science well. Articles in newspapers and popular magazines generally lack the context to judge experimental results. They tend to overemphasize the certainty of any result, for instance presenting a new experimental medicine as the "discovery of the cure" of a disease. Also, newspapers and magazines frequently publish articles about scientific results before those results have been peer-reviewed or reproduced by other experimenters. They also tend not to report adequately on the methodology of scientific work, or the degree of experimental error. Thus, popular newspaper and magazine sources are generally not reliable sources for science and medicine articles.</p>
<p>What can a popular-press article on scientific research provide? Often, the most useful thing is the name of the head researcher involved in a project, and the name of his or her institution. For instance, a newspaper article quoting Joe Smith of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution regarding whales' response to sonar gives you a strong suggestion of where to go to find more: look up his work on the subject. Rather than citing the newspaper article, cite his published papers." <a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 04:03, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think the issue is a little bit bigger than that. If I emphasized using popular sources, then I admit I was wrong there. But the use of reliable secondary sources (monographs, scientific textbooks, etc) still seems more favorable than citing individual studies all the time. I know it can be hard to find secondary sources for current events, so that can be a challenge as well. What I most importantly want everyone to keep in mind is the "no original research bit". Sometimes it takes an expert to be able to interpret scientific studies. And publishing such interpretations for the first time here on wikipedia violates OR. Towards the top of the page you quoted me is:</p>
<p>"In general, Wikipedia articles should not depend on primary sources but rather on reliable secondary sources who have made careful use of the primary-source material. Most primary-source material requires training to use correctly, especially on historical topics. Wikipedia articles may use primary sources only if they have been published by a reliable publisher e.g. trial transcripts published by a court stenographer, or historic documents that appear in edited collections."</p>

They focus more on having things be verifiable and reliable and representive of the "scientific consensus". Following these guidelines, I still feel the rat study of mifepristone has nothing to do with the human deaths, unless we can cite a reliable source connecting the two (not a popular press article, but something that first WP:RS). Side note, good work with the ME article! Oh and I'm glad your user page isn't a redlink anymore. (sounds like we have a lot in common)--Andrew c 16:28, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>1. "what i want everyone to keep in mind is..." this phrase is an example of how you speak sometimes which i believe can be annoying/offensive to others. it makes you sound kinda like a blowhard. remember, it also specifically says in policy that we are not here to supervise each other. careful not to cop the attitude in general that you are an authority, and everyone else must be policed. all other editors are peers with whom you collaborate. you have a tendency to cite policy excessively and as if no one else has read it. and to conflate your opinions and preferences with policy. (yes, you did not appear to be aware that citing the secondary sources is not recommended in sci med; no, i do not need to reread all info not pertaining to sci/med which you have just reiterated...)</p>
<p>2. i'm still waiting for an apology re your behavior regarding complaining about multiple edits and citations. i think it was extremely hostile, intolerant, impatient, and unusual. (i.e., other people do not react this way in general. it is better not to assume that what other people do is directed at you, and you should therefore take great personal offense and "counterattack," especially if what annoys you is a matter of personal preference...) i think it would also be nice if you looked over the talkpage on <a href="../../../h/o/r/Hormonal_contraception.html" title="Hormonal contraception">hormonal contraception</a> and analyzed your communication with me--i.e., it would have been nice if you had said "oh sorry" re recent edits, and if you had posted some response to the follow up about your complaints. i was pretty nice to you both on that talkpage and on your talkpage--and i don't think you returned the favor.</p>
<p>3. please take some time to read over the bottom of Davidruben's talkpage, under "guideline?" i would appreciate it if you spent some time pondering both a) inclusionist treatment even of vandals b) "don't complain--contribute."</p>
<p>4. re the rat study, i think if you feel strongly about it, you are obligated to read the entire "certified verbatim" transcript of the CDER hearing, and every study by esther sternberg, and every study cited by sternberg and miech, to determine that it wasn't included under miech's statement that "the hypothesis that mifepristone can cause bacterial infection is supported by animal experimentation"...in order to evaluate research, one has to do research/read the cited material... <a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 18:26, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I feel really bad doing this after trying to smooth things over with you, but I am a little concerned with some of your recent article creations. It seems like you may be violating copyrights by copying content from other sites into your new articles. I'm not going to chide you and quote policy, or ack bigger or more knowledgable than you. I'm just going to say two things: 1) please try to be more careful in the future in regards to using your own words, or using quotes around quoted content and 2) please work to fix these issues in the existing articles you have created. I'd be more than happy to address specifics if that needs to happen, but hopefully this kind note will be enough.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">read up on copyright, plagiarism, fair use</span></h2>
<p>based on your comments, it is clear to me that you don't understand any of these concepts. there is, first of all, "substantiality." so, to repeat that the mission statement of organization x is xyz after reading it elsewhere and noting a reference is not a copyright violation of the source, as one sentence has been reproduced, a tiny fraction of the source. (the mission statement of NWHN is several paragraphs long. so a sentence is not only a selective paraphrase, but probably too reductive.) it may be more elegant to say their stated mission is x, but it does not need quotes (And in fact quotes are awk/inelegant.) paraphrasing and rearranging a small fraction of a total source is not copyright violation, particularly where facts are simply restated. (i.e., they are not literary works like say, a poem.) if mere facts are restated, they don't even all have to be reworded, as long as they are not a reproduction in whole (a whole article, a whole paragraph) from a source, particularly where refs are cited. so for example, if one says, she was born in 1932, or she demonstrated a prototype of a machine, this not only does not need quotes, but would be ridiculous. <a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 02:58, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Andrew. I requested people from WikiProject Catholicism review the Talk page because <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> is our main article. You can see from my own Talk page people from WikiProject Catholicism regularly get asked to participate in votes. You also placed a similar request at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Catholicism.</p>
<p>On the matter of Sacraments of the Catholic Church, it was well over due to be closed. How would you have called it? --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiCats_43d6.html" title="User:WikiCats">WikiCats</a> 15:41, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Don't apologize Andrew. You make a good point about Sacraments of the Catholic Church. I will revert my close and request an admin. do it.</p>
<p>As far as leaving the Roman Catholic Church poll open longer, I think we would need to get the others to agree to that because the poll was supposed to last for 5 days. --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiCats_43d6.html" title="User:WikiCats">WikiCats</a> 16:13, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">trying to look at misoprostol with a cold eye</span></h2>
<p>i had a good time nerding-out doing the brazil research--what do you think of the summary sentence(s)? i found one source which claims misoprostol is used illegally in mozambique, but no numbers/studies yet. the "used in many countries" quote is on ibis cite, and that sentence could be put back in, but i would rather have more specific sources. (?)</p>
<p>overall, what do you think article needs for NPOV/"comprehensive treatment of subject without going onto too much digressive detail"?</p>
<p>(i am thinking it needs 1) needs info about miso in the '70s 2)the cervidil info worked in 3)more info about artrotec, the miso+painkiller combo used in uk 4) some info about prostaglandins 5)more about the mechanism of action; how it is similar/diff to other prostaglandins) do you have ideas about what else/what should be adjusted? <a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 00:44, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"IDX, along with dilation and evacuation (D&amp;E), early induction of labor, and rare procedures such as saline abortions, are only used in the late stages of pregnancy. Late-term abortions are uncommon, with abortions at 21 weeks or later accounting for only 1.4% of all abortions in the USA.[12] Intact D&amp;X procedures are used in approximately 15% of late-term abortion cases. This calculates to between 2,500 and 3,000 per year, using data from the Alan Guttmacher Institute for the year 2000. "</p>
<p>ok, i accuse you of having read this IDX article and not alleged that the arithmetic performed on data from guttmacher was original research...but, not a big deal.
