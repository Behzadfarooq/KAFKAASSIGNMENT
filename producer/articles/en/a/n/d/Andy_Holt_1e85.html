<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Holt_1e85.html" title="Edit section: Character History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Character History</span></h2>
<p>Andy arrived as a student at HCC and was seen as an easy going lad with a charm for the ladies, but there was always a dark side to him that no one was ever aware of. Andy became best friends with <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Owen_553b.html" title="Sam Owen">Sam Owen</a> as he took him under his wing and Sam admired Andy as he was confident, good with girls- everything that Sam wasn’t. Their friendship made both Andy and Sam inseparable as Sam even went along with Andy’s ‘This Way Up’ campaign which saw the pair involved in an illegal and dangerous stunts. But Sam was not aware of the ‘real Andy’ and neither were the viewers as they were in for a shock.</p>
<p>In the late night special <b>Hollyoaks: Crossing the Line</b>, During <a href="../../../l/e/e/Lee_Hunter_013e.html" title="Lee Hunter">Lee Hunter</a>’s presidential party, Andy spiked Danni Carboni’s drink with GHB drug and later on he went on to rape her. Despite being raped, Danni could not remember anything the morning after and Andy began to show his manipulative side as he convinced Danni that she slept with him and manage to win over Sam, that he was unaware that Danni was dating <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russ_Owen_e7cb.html" title="Russ Owen">Russ Owen</a> (Sam's brother) and that she was all over him.</p>
<p>From there on, Andy began a long journey of spiking girls drinks and raping them, but as his friendship with Sam grew, Andy felt he could trust Sam. Andy confessed everything to Sam, and then influenced into thinking that drug rape was okay and the two shook hands as the pair began to take advantages of more girls. As more girls were being drug raped, the more awareness was created, but Andy thought this would mean more of a challenge.</p>
<p>In another late night special <b>Hollyoaks: No Going Back</b> Andy drugged both <a href="../../../m/e/l/Mel_Burton_7a92.html" title="Mel Burton">Mel</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/p/Sophie_Burton_81f6.html" title="Sophie Burton">Sophie Burton</a>, as he also invited Sam to rape Sophie. While Andy raped Mel in her own home, Sam decided not to go through with raping Sophie, but told Andy that he did the deed. However, the drug rape scenario was becoming common in Hollyoaks as Danni became convinced that Andy drug raped her and the Burton twins also realised that they have become victims of Andy. However, what worried Andy more then having his victims know what he did was the fact when he discovered that Sam did not go ahead in raping Sophie and he felt betrayed when Sam had lied to him. Andy met up with Sam at the quarry for another ’This Way Up’ challenge, but ended in Andy confronting Sam about why he lied to him. During the scene, Russ burst on in revenge against Andy for what he did to Danni and a brawl began between the three of them. It led to Andy being pushed accidentally off the quarry, leaving Russ and Sam the fear that they killed Andy.</p>
<p>But the pair were to prove wrong as Andy survived the mighty long fall and vowed for revenge against the Owen brother. After a few months, Andy was ready for his vengeance against Sam and Russ. In the last late night special in this storyline called <b><a href="../../../b/a/c/Hollyoaks%7E_Back_from_the_Dead_8168.html" title="Hollyoaks: Back from the Dead">Hollyoaks: Back from the Dead</a></b>, Andy kidnapped Sam and Russ's younger sister <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicole_Owen_b177.html" title="Nicole Owen">Nicole Owen</a>. Nicole thought she was being taken for a romantic weekend getaway in Southport but when her mobile phone rang and Sam and Russ told her to get away from Andy. With several messages given to Russ and Sam, they realised that Andy was alive and had held their sister hostage in Southport, as they made a bid to find him.</p>
<p>Eventually the pair made it to the warehouse in <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southport.html" title="Southport">Southport</a> Pleasureland where Andy had captured Nicole but were left heavily beaten by Andy who attacked the brothers with a pole. Andy tortured the three Owen family members as he revealed the part of Sam during the drug rape and also began to rape Nicole in front of her brothers, until he was hit from behind by a unlikely hero, Melanie Burton. Mel had come to Southport for the weekend with her friend <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam__O.B.__O%27Brien_a638.html" title="Sam &quot;O.B.&quot; O'Brien">Sam "O.B." O'Brien</a> and had seen Andy but her O.B didn't believe her. Andy woke up and found himself tied to a chair as Mel fed him his own medicine of GHB and was questioned by her, but eventually managed to escape her clutches. His fate however was met as he ran from Mel and as he went into a dark warehouse, he ran straight into sharp arrow which stabbed him right through his stomach as he died a painful death.</p>
