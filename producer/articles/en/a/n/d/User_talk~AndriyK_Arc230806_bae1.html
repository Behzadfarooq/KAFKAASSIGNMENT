<p>Hi, while we're all delighted that you decided to come back, I'm a little concerned about the fact that the vast majority of your edits since your ban ended are revert warring. Aside from the fact that you could get into trouble over that, I think (at least in the case of <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_architecture.html" title="Russian architecture">Russian architecture</a>) that you should list all your objections on the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Talk%7ERussian_architecture_61be.html" title="Talk:Russian architecture">talk page</a> before adding the tag and, in the interests of avoiding violating the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">3RR</a>, not to revert again, at least, for the next sixteen hours. If the other users don't know what you are disputing, how can slapping a POV tag on without saying anything be any help? You could try tagging the specific sections you object to with {{<a href="../../../d/u/b/Template%7EDubious_a2d6.html" title="Template:Dubious">dubious</a>}} instead, so as to give some indication to everyone else what is troubling you - they may even agree with you. --<a href="../../../l/a/t/User%7ELatinus_7925.html" title="User:Latinus">Latinus</a> 18:34, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I explained my objections several months ago. I also proposed the way to solve th eissue. But a group of Russian chauvinistic POV-pushers do not accept any compromises, do not propose any other solutions. They just silently removed the POV-tag during my ban.</dd>
<dd>If you are interested, please look through the talk page.</dd>
<dd>Thanks for your comment anyway.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndriyK_f787.html" title="User:AndriyK">AndriyK</a> 10:01, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>AndiyK: "Irpen usually prefers an edit war rather than a fair discussion"</p>
<dl>
<dd>Irpen: "This above is a plain lie."
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So, <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndriyK_f787.html" title="User:AndriyK">AndriyK</a>, let me give you an update.&#160;:)</dd>
<dd>Based on my short experience I would not say that Irpen is a guy who prefers edit wars. He seems to be a reasonable guy, and actually I think he is. He is capable of listening to arguments. He is doing his best to be patient. He was the major force in taking Bonoparte down. He was too supportive in Alex Bakharev's RfA. He is also the one who attemts to calm down Kuban kazak, when kazak is not acting "like a saint".</dd>
<dd>It's hard to cooperate with Kuban Kazak, but it's possible. It's not unoften that he reverts first, and then analyses what is going on. He loves metro. He is a patriot of Russia, but I personally would say that he is againts independent Ukraine. He does things that he knows are wrong.</dd>
<dd>Alex Bakharev has got adminship that he dreamed of, but I would say that he've got too much credit from Ezhiki and Irpen, which he probably does not deserve. Based on my experiance he is unpatient and biased. I doubt he would ever be a good admin. But it's also unlikely to expect from him being so terrible to give opponents a chance to claim the withdrawal of his adminship privilegy.</dd>
<dd>I've never crossed with Ezhiki personally, but he seems to be a very reasonable and smart guy. I don't know why he nominated Alex for admin. It may be just the best option out of the restricted set he had.</dd>
<dd>Ukrained was too agressive. Together with his limited Internet connection he probably spent too much time on a few unimportant issues.</dd>
<dd>Mzajac was not so much around. Unfortunately.</dd>
<dd>Ghirlandajo is another agressive guy. He focuses on too many issues. From what I see he used to revert a few details without much of understanding. He enjoys edit wars. Now he is fighting against Poland.</dd>
<dd>DDima is a very pleasant guy. He loves Kiev.</dd>
<dd>Mikkalai is somewhere around. Smart guy.</dd>
<dd>Andrew Alexander is a good editor. Sticks to the subject.</dd>
<dd>Vasile was persistent in bringing some nonsense, including "Ukraine joining NATO by 2008"&#160;:) I wish it could be true.&#160;:) He is actually one of few who is learning the Ukraininan history from this wikipedia, by reading it.</dd>
<dd>Constantzeanu, Vasile, Annitas and few other love to count Moldovians as Romanians.</dd>
<dd>Bogdangiusca is biased toward the mentioned above group, but it's not that visible.</dd>
<dd>Serhio is a young Moldovian guy but he cannot do much alone.</dd>
<dd>Who else? One more. AndriyK was banned for a month that I was around. He didn't do anything this month, still he was painted as the worst possible nightmare of the Ukrainian wikicommunity.</dd>
<dd>That's about it. I think I didn't write anything personally offensive against anybody. If you think I did, I really appologize. Please also weight the benefits of such third-party opinion. Feel free to delete it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Thanks for the comment. I see, you are a quite experiencie editor. Why not to register? I agree with you on most of the points, but still not on all of them. In particular, I find Alex Bakarev much more reasonable than many other editors. Concerning Irpen, I think you need a bit more time to understand the issue. His trolling are very subtle, and most of the people do not see it at the beginning. Please contact me by mail after your registration.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndriyK_f787.html" title="User:AndriyK">AndriyK</a> 09:21, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>AndriyK, please keep all the tags. Removing a tag does not solve the issue. The rules are the same for everyone.</dd>
<dd>With the Russian Architecture article in the meantime I would really advise mediation. Either side of the dispute may initiate it, and both sides should agree for the mediation to go though. On your side, if you do initiate it, it'll be a very significant indication of your willingness to cooperate.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I tried already to request mediation concerning another article. But with Irpen it did not work. First he apparently agreed, but then find every reason to postpone it. The mediation did not started. He pushed his version by his favorite method: persistent revert warring with help of his gang (like Ghirla or Kuban Kazak). So I would not waste my and mediator's time to initiate one more mediation. On the other hand, if Irpen or somebody else initiates it, I'll participate.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndriyK_f787.html" title="User:AndriyK">AndriyK</a> 08:24, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There is formal and informal mediation. Formal one requires formal acception or rejection of the other side. You only need to summarize your points in one paragraph in order to initiate it.</dd>
<dd>What is really needed is Ukrainian architecture article. Then both Ukrainian architecture and <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_architecture.html" title="Russian architecture">Russian architecture</a> may include a short description and a reference to the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Architecture_of_Kievan_Rus_170f.html" title="Architecture of Kievan Rus">Architecture of Kievan Rus</a> as the common main article for the architecture of that period.</dd>
<dd>Consider, for example <a href="http://myukraine.info/en/culture/art/Architecture" class="external text" title="http://myukraine.info/en/culture/art/Architecture" rel="nofollow">this article</a> as a starting point for Ukrainian architecture.</dd>

<p>Hey, AndriyK. Bringing new info, references would be of more value to the project than "fact" and "dubious" templates. Don't hesitate to edit articles. The main idea is not pointing out incorrect, or dubious, or POV statements, but fixing them.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This is exactly what I did when I was new here. I corrected mistakes that I found in the articles and supported my edits by references. But my corrections were immediatelly reverted by Irpen and alike. Usually, they do not cited any sources. Any my attempts to insist on my (sourced) version resulted in an edit war.</dd>
<dd>So I decided to go another way. First, I mark a mistake with the template, so that other people can realise that there is a mistake or unsourced info. It works better. Although Irpen and Ghirla continue trolling and try to remove the templates and it often results in edit wars, but they seem to get weaker support from the community than it was when I tried to correct the mistakes at once.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndriyK_f787.html" title="User:AndriyK">AndriyK</a> 08:42, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I prefer to edit articles rather than marking them with a tag, as it shows exactly what I think should be corrected or added. I think the community doesn't like many tags; community wants to see perfect articles, which means without tags.
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It likely so. But there is a powefull part of the community that prefers to see propaganda instead of factual information in the articles. The purpose of the tags is to show this to the other part of the community.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndriyK_f787.html" title="User:AndriyK">AndriyK</a> 12:44, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Irpen is a major contributor of the Ukr related articles. And as he mentioned he is Ukrainian.&#160;:) There should be some common grounds between him and you.
<dl>
<dd>A great part of Irpen's contributions is subtle anti-Ukrainian propaganda, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ukrainian_language&amp;diff=24530173&amp;oldid=24424592" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ukrainian_language&amp;diff=24530173&amp;oldid=24424592" rel="nofollow">this</a>. He might have Ukrainian passport, but he acts like he hates Ukrainian history, Ukrainian language, Ukrainian independence. He does not show it openly, like, for instance, Ghirla, but he uses every opportunity to bite. (I can show you examples, if you like).</dd>
<dd>Additionally, he chases Ukrainian editors forcing them to stop editing wikipedia. You may disagree, but this is not only my opinion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ukrained&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=42308648" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ukrained&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=42308648" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</dd>
<dd>Therefore, we have very little common with Irpen, except, perheps, similar passports.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndriyK_f787.html" title="User:AndriyK">AndriyK</a> 12:44, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I proposed the solution at the very beginning of the discussion. But it was rejected by the opponents.

<dd>Well, Andriy, may be you should challenge that policy mentioned above? As far as I understand, all or many policies are changeable in a way.

Four arbitrators have now rejected your application, named above, without prejudice, saying that it looks like "a misguided request for content arbitration". In general the Arbitration Committee avoids content arbitration, primarily because the community is presumed to be capable of making content decisions.</p>
<p>If left as it is, it's highly likely that the request will fail and be removed by a clerk or an arbitrator in the near future. If there is a user conduct issue, however, as a clerk I recommend that you withdraw it yourself and resubmit a new case based on user conduct. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 18:04, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes tell us about your respect for policies, how many articles did you move and locked the re-directs? Or how you vote frauded two Ruthenian (not Ukrainian as that country did not exist at the time) Chernigov Princes? Or what about the 600-revert St. Vladimir's Cathedral?

<dd>My two cents: I take AndriyK's WP work seriously and appreciatively. He is doing an important (although uncomfortable) deopinionizing job on UA-related pages. All Andriy's past mistakes and breaches of WP rules are I believe aimed to that descent goal.
<dl>
<dd>Well in that case ever consider to remind him to deopinionise himself. That would indeed be a massive benefit to WP and to all UA-related topics. Let's hope he follows that advice, and will reach that descent goal (I <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">Assume good faith</a>])</dd>

<dd>In that case why do you continue to revert war and to push your POV. Consensus is a tricky thing, we can achieve consensus to have Russian titles for Kiev Metro stations, but that would not be correct would it? Consensus and neutrality are not synomons, and when you push your POV into Battle of the Lower Dnieper or Russian Architecture, you are trying to achieve consensus based on an extreame POV. Yet you are so blinded by Russophobic sentiment that you can never admit to step down from pushing your POV.

<p>Thank you for your concern. My endorsement will stay as I agree with the overall points raised in Alex's summary. Please note that an argument about having or not having a certain tag does not fall under the definition of "suggestions on improving the article", although it can certainly be classified as "discussion". Fine semantics such as this, however, are of little importance in the bigger picture considered by this RfC.

<dl>
<dd>Declined, sorry. You were not blocked for 3RR violation, but rather for general edit warring which is a kind of disruption. Although we do have a 3-revert rule here, that does not imply that edit warring is okay if you do it more slowly. Edit warring is very disruptive to Wikipedia, and a perfectly reasonable reason for a block. I checked; the edits Dmcdevit mentioned were in fact examples of you reverting the edits of other people to a version you had previously instated. The 3RR is a rule that lets us see when edit warring is <i>starting</i> to get out of hand; in these cases, edit warring was already out of hand, and your reverting is probably fueling more antagonism. Hence, the block. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 20:18, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You can see that was my last edit before leaving, until now, because I had to get to work, or I would have warned Kuban myself before now (and I thank Mangojuice for doing so). Kuban Kazak's warning is sufficient to me for now because, unlike you, he hadn't <i>just</i> been blocked for edit warring, and hadn't gotten any warning. He'll find himself blocked if he continues also. Please do not refer to other editors' good faith edits as vandalism, as this is a form of incivility. Vandalism is a bad-faith attempt to damage the integrity of the encyclopedia, not a content dispute. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 04:07, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

The fact is that I am not everywhere at all times. I saw you edit warring because I had just blocked you for edit warring. That's all. In no way does that fact that I didn't happen to notice other edit warring (largely because I wasn't blocking you for your <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukrainization.html" title="Ukrainization">Ukrainization</a> edit in particular, but for reverts across many articles) mean that I condone <i>any</i> edit warring. "It seems you look at the people you dislike for some unclear reasons" is a rather uncalled for assumption of bad faith. The fact is that you <i>were</i> edit warring despite my warning, and the block was correct. If you have any reason to think I dislike you, I'd like to see it, because as far as I know, my warnings and blocks are the first I've ever had contact with you. Please don't assume that because I blocked you my motivations were out of a personal dislike and not out of a simple judgment call. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 08:09, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Deletion of properly inserted dispute tags <b>does</b> damage the integrity of the encyclopedia because it hinder resolving POV disputes. Having deleted the tag, the supporter of POV-version of the article do not care about dispute resolution, they ignore <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a>, refuse mediation etc. The reader remains uninformed that article is biased. It is not a surprise, that deletion of properly inserted dispute tags is forbidden by the policy.</dd>
<dd>Any edit war always has two sides (one cannot be edit warring with oneself&#160;;) ). This does not mean that both sides are always equelly guilty. Therefore, unbiased and good faithed admin always checks the role of each users in the edit war. Reverting unexplained edits or edits with offensive edit summaries is, in most cases, usefull activity. While offensive edit summaries, removing properly inserted tags, etc. is a violation of the Policies and has to be prevented or punished.</dd>
<dd>It is difficult to assume a good faith towards the admin, who blocked one of the users and ignored incivility and violation of the Policies by the other ones. It could happen once by mistake. But if it happens second time with an experienced admin and ArbCom member, after the situation was explained by e-mail and on the talk page, it makes me think that the admin abuses his power to support his friends or the users with similar POVs. I would be glad if you convince me that I am mistaking. Thanks.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndriyK_f787.html" title="User:AndriyK">AndriyK</a> 17:34, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't share AndriyK's suspicion about "friends" or "users with similar POVs".</dd>
<dd>But I would like to second AndriyK's concerns about removing the dispute tags. Dispute tags are an important way for people to show that there are problems with the article. The problem has to be resolved according to <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a>.

<p>AndriyK, this is a well-known tactic frequently used in football: trying to shame the referee who in all fairness is harsh towards the violator to be harsh too (even if unfairly) towards an opponent. It sometimes works and causes even unjustified penalty kicks ordered by a referee in fear of being called unfair in order to show even-handedness.</p>
<p>Your entire activity in Wikipedia is a huge disruption and you are getting the exact treatment you are asking for. Your disputed tags were placed improperly in contravention to sources cited earlier at the article's talk pages or in the articles themselves. Your unwarranted tag-trolling and revert warring is but the only activity taken at Wikipedia since your month ban by ArbCom for other dirty tricks. You loaded the talk pages of a whole lot of people with baseless accusations and uninterrupted pestering for already answered questions. Your Wikilawyering and unwarranted appeals to the Policy pages where you also gain no support are yet as disruptive.</p>
<p>If you continue this tactic you will find yourself frequently blocked and experienced admins will be able to see who is acting in bad faith here. My hope is that you will simply change your ways and seize disruptive activities for now limited to tag-trolling, revert-warring, wikilawyering, content removal, attacking your opponents and unsuccessful attempts to recruit the supporters for your crusade. If you don't, you have no one but yourself to blame for not being able to edit. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 18:25, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>First two points: 1) when there is a dispute an edit war is the last thing people want (by people I mean a majority of civil and behaved people not the narrow "Ukrainian" group that you represent). When people begin to attack articles, move them with blocked redirects and then vote fraud the revertion of the move, and then start pushing your own opinion into those articles by reverting them <b>40 times</b> at least is DISRUPTIVE. Any admin will take this issue seriously, particulary against a user who was previously arbcom-banned for actions such as above. BTW no need to lie about what you were banned for, all the arbitrators endorsed the vote fraud and edit warring <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/AndriyK#Findings_of_fact" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/AndriyK#Findings_of_fact" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>. With respect to my conduct, then I am a human and like any human we all have our limits in the amount of civility. When people like you begin to go to a scale of 40 reverts since an arbcom ban expired and hardly any useful contributions at the same time who do you think the admin will take out of the two evils, especially when one is provoked solely by the other. Had you not edit warred with tags do you think I would have insulted you? Do you think that you would have been already banned the second time as a warning against disrupitve behaivour? Unlike you me and Grafik as well as Ghirla and Irpen take priority in writing articles and then dealing with assaults against them, NOT the opposite way. <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">An apology</a> would be most suitable. --<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">Kuban Cossack</a> <a href="../../../r/o/m/Image%7ERomanov_Flag.svg_2101.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/c0/Romanov_Flag.svg/25px-Romanov_Flag.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../r/o/m/Image%7ERomanov_Flag.svg_2101.html" /></a> 10:05, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>DePOVing does <i><b>not</b></i> mean inserting tags everywhere. As I pointed out already, blanking and tagging is not a solution, however, editing is.</dd>
<dd>With your continuous tag warring, you literally <b>ruin</b> the efforts of Wikipedians who write, with infinite pains, articles on various subjects. Then you come and start defacing them with supposedly POV tags instead of editing and improving (and <i>actually</i> dePOVing if needed) them. This attitude is absolutely intolerable and in my (not so) humble opinion your block is well earned. -- <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrafikm_fr_a2d0.html" title="User:Grafikm fr"><font color="blue"><b>Grafikm</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrafikm_fr_126e.html" title="User talk:Grafikm fr"><b><font color="red">(AutoGRAF)</font></b></a></sup> 19:35, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It sounds to me as a Polish word suited to Ukrainian phonetics. The original Polish version might be Międżybórz or something like it.

<dd>I do not know the history of this particular town, but in that part of Ukraine there are a lot of villages with ethnic Polish population. For instance there was a village Богудзєнька(Bohudzen'ka). (It was renamed by Soviets because it means "Gratitude to God" in Polish.) One should not be surprised with Polish names in this region.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndriyK_f787.html" title="User:AndriyK">AndriyK</a> 14:18, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>There is/was indeed an essential Polish community in the town (see the photo of the Catholic church <a href="http://www.kingdom.kiev.ua/ukraine/region/22/medzhibozh.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.kingdom.kiev.ua/ukraine/region/22/medzhibozh.html" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>). Still the name means likely not "between forests" (as it's stated in the article) but rather "between Buhs": the town is located between two rivers Southern Buh(Boh) and Bozhok(wich means "small Boh"). It used to have name Межибоже (Mezhybozhe), which sounds more Ukrainian than Medzhybizh.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndriyK_f787.html" title="User:AndriyK">AndriyK</a> 14:41, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
