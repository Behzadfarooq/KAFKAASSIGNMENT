<p><a href="../../../p/c/w/User%7EPcw_09dd.html" title="User:Pcw">Peter Wayner</a> has set up a project at <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dartmouth_College_efeb.html" title="Dartmouth College">Dartmouth College</a> in a course for non-computing majors that has led some of them to create articles that are clearly unencyclopedic by Wikipedia's current standards, and others that are borderline. I suspect he was unaware of <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchool_and_university_projects_a92e.html" title="Wikipedia:School and university projects">Wikipedia:School and university projects</a>, and that he's given his students what I would consider inadequate instruction on the need to lurk and to respect existing standards when entering a new cybercommunity.</p>
<p>But, whatever the reason for some of these articles appearing on VfD, I think there may be a case for delaying their deletion until the course concludes. These are not computing majors and it's unlikely to be their fault, and it may not be anybody's. The policies aren't all that easy to find!</p>
<p>I have already asked Peter to supply the course conclusion date. Comments? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 22:10, 20 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think it's a good idea. [[User:Dpbsmith|<a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a>]] 23:46, 20 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I agree. I have also left a note on Peter's talk page linking to several articles and lists that have plenty of red links, suggesting he direct his students to those, rather than documenting every custom and group related to Dartmouth. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 02:38, 21 Aug 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Peter has now replied to me by email. Assessment will be completed by next Wednesday, which is 25 August, I assume that's Dartmouth time, so I suggest that any deletions agreed (which looks likely to be all those listed) be deferred until 26 August.</dd>
<dd>I'm sending him some suggestions as to how his next course can be improved. Depending how we handle this, it is an excellent way of creating new contributors, or new enemies. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 17:27, 21 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>For the record: this is yet another interesting example of partial misunderstandings on both sides. On the Pcw side, it looked to him as if there were people who had something against Dartmouth and were trying to marginalize it out of animus. On the Wikipedia side, it looked to many of us as if there were a systematic effort to unbalance Wikipedia with a glut of promotional puff pieces about Dartmouth.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you look at his actual <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~cs4/S2004/hw/hw6.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~cs4/S2004/hw/hw6.html" rel="nofollow">class assignment</a>, he does <i>not</i> specifically tell his students to write articles about Dartmouth, and he <i>does</i> say:</dd>

Read about <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContributing_to_Wikipedia_bc52.html" title="Wikipedia:Contributing to Wikipedia">contributing to the Wikipedia</a>.

<dd>That seems very good to me. Any student that had actually read all the suggested links would probably have been OK. He needed to give his students some specific pointers on things not to do and needed to explain (and understand!) the "ruthless editing" mechanism and the VfD process. It seems interesting to me that a professor, able to write such a well-designed assignment, would, in VfD show so much typical counterproductive defensive behavior including, I really believe, creating a sock puppet. I strongly suspect that we are actually inducing such behavior in people who might not show it under ordinary circumstances. I am keeping my fingers crossed and hoping that things will be resolved in a positive manner.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>BTW, as I write this it looks to me as if the course that events in VfD are following is <i>not</i> be to delete the articles, but to strip them of promotional language, boil them down in size, and merge them into <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dartmouth_College_efeb.html" title="Dartmouth College">Dartmouth College</a>. If he has the right attitude and is willing to show his next class the articles on <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dartmouth_College_efeb.html" title="Dartmouth College">Dartmouth College</a> "before" and "after," it may actually be a good example of Wikiprocess at work.

<p>Perhaps there's something I'm missing here, but I don't see your point or points at all. Easiest first:</p>
<p>I share your concern that trust in tags is important, but I don't see how your proposal helps. I did point out that the posts were both from IPs, rather than from the users as claimed. Obviously then the signatures should be disregarded, but perhaps you think this should be explicit?</p>
<p>(Incidentally, what do you mean by <i>SP</i>? Acronym finder returns <a href="http://www.acronymfinder.com/af-query.asp?acronym=SP&amp;String=exact&amp;page=9" class="external text" title="http://www.acronymfinder.com/af-query.asp?acronym=SP&amp;String=exact&amp;page=9" rel="nofollow">177 meanings</a> but none seem to fit too well.)</p>
<p>I don't see how what I've done <i>bypasses verifiability</i>.</p>
<p>And I don't see how the link you provided and suggested as a model is in any way superior to the one I provided. I think that both of the pages they link to need to be examined to see what is going on. Now, each of the pages linked to provides a direct link to the other. It's not obvious to me why one should be preferred over the other.</p>
<p>I almost always use the preview when providing links, and did in this case. Again, I don't see that the link you suggest provides any advantage there.</p>
<p>Or, as I said above, am I missing something? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 09:29, 2 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Implicit in my phrase "gives <i>you</i> a chance to double-check your compiling of your research" (in Ph0 &amp; quoted in Ph1) is what you've at least missed letting me know whether you're now aware of. Moving twd the point, i mean that which</p>

<p>I think you'll find that effort required, per SP verified as forged and single-contrib, is</p>
<ul>
<li>Your method: linking 3 times and searching the history for an IP-quad</li>
<li>Mine: 2 linkings w/o any search</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I think they both have exactly the same number of linkings and searches. The only difference is which page is displayed first. But there's something strange here. How do you display the user contributions without doing this search? Or do you think it's not useful to do this?
<dl>
<dd>I expect the author's effort is pretty close between the two. The difference i see is in the effort of the hopefully many readers. The research indeed can't be done without going to the history page and searching it. But repeating that is unnecessary for verifying the accuracy of the result:
<ul>
<li>The identity of the editor is proven by the appropriate edit-diffs page (which is what i suggest providing the link to).</li>
<li>The short contribs list is proven by following the contribs link at the top of the upper right-hand column.</li>
<li>There is no additional information of interest on the history page, or produced by the search, so with my method, the reader is done without doing anything further. But your method doesn't get the reader to the edit diffs w/o linking to the history page and searching it for an entry with the same IP. That is the difference of which i spoke.--<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerzy_42e0.html" title="User:Jerzy">Jerzy</a><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJerzy_59c9.html" title="User talk:Jerzy">(t)</a> 05:43, 2004 Sep 3 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>IMO your clerical error got published (as you suggest, despite previewing) bcz you faced an even greater <i>difference</i> of effort in an easier, slightly different, related task.</p>
<dl>
<dd>And IMO your method doesn't help. But thanks for the suggestion.
<dl>
<dd>IMO you've spoken after some thought that involved a judgement: you judged that your thought experiments were as valuable as actual experiments. (I'm not suggesting you're stupid: that is a normal mode of human behavior, in the absence of specific contrary influences, and the inertia of that pattern should be obvious: Aristotle explained how obvious it is that the heavier something is the faster it falls, and it took nearly 2 millenia before Galileo's experiments (which are symbolized by the leaning-tower story) showed otherwise. For many people the corrective is their first permanent job.)--<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerzy_42e0.html" title="User:Jerzy">Jerzy</a><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJerzy_59c9.html" title="User talk:Jerzy">(t)</a> 05:43, 2004 Sep 3 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It seems that some folks, for whatever reason, are thinking that "the deletionists" are a problem best solved by unilateral action. You saw the Village Pump discussion, and you and I are on the same general side of the discussion.

<dd>Agree it won't do.

<p>There's a disclaimer at the top of the village pump that says "Please note: this page is not a place to make lasting comments. Discussions are removed daily to make room for new ones." If you have a better plan for archiving which does not "leave a lot to be desired", I suggest you propose this on the talk page. Otherwise, please do not attack the people who do remove the old sections. The page is currently 153kb, largely as a result of people not being bold enough to clear out the old sections because they fear people will complain about it in exactly the way you have done on <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia_talk%7EDeletion_of_user_subpages_17e7.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Deletion of user subpages">Wikipedia talk:Deletion of user subpages</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 12:03, Sep 6, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Point taken, and I have inserted a clarification into my comments.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But I think you are being a bit unkind here. It wasn't intended as criticism of these people, or attack on anyone. Yes, it is criticism of the current system, and I may have a look at that once the dust settles on this vote which is my current priority on policy and procedural matters, and even then it's unlikely to be my top priority.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have been critical of Tim certainly. I still think he simply didn't do his homework. The discussion period was plainly described in the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia_talk%7EDeletion_of_user_subpages_17e7.html#Process" title="Wikipedia talk:Deletion of user subpages">process</a> section, which was deliberately the second section of the page, directly below the vote section that he deleted. As a result he has wasted my time and confused at least one supporter who now demands clarification, and probably others. He has enormous prestige here and his opposition is something I could have done without. But even this is not attack. We are all human.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>I will be compiling a <i>lessons learned</i> as soon as the dust settles and the proposal is either accepted and working, rejected or (worst) accepted but not working. I have really tried to do the right thing on this one, and some may now ask, what's the point? The time for Tim to comment was in the two weeks in which the proposal (including the process section) was open for discussion. One lesson is that the relevant talk page and the Pump were not sufficient publicity for this proposal.</dd>

<dd>Two other possible places that I considered were the Deletion Policy talk page and the mailing lists. I didn't do these because I wasn't prepared to keep track of the discussion that might have followed in either place, and they didn't seem the best places for this discussion anyway. In hindsight, I should have notified on the Deletion Policy talk page, and belatedly will. I'm now of two minds about the mailing lists.

<p>Hi Andrew, thanks for the heads up on the vote. I for one am bewildered at the opposition to the policy being frozen while voting takes place—I have no idea how a policy vote can possibly work if the policy is changed mid-vote to something different to what the earlier voters supported or opposed?!

<dd>It was a nasty surprise for me. My guess is that for once, Tim didn't do his homework, and that this is a knee-jerk reaction on his part based on the misapprehension that there had been no invitation to discussion previously.

<dd>I did. I think if the problem is the length of the page, it could easily be segmented into 7 "daily" pages... M,T,W,Th,F,S,S....

<p>Andrewa, unfortunately your workaround didn't work for me. However, your suggestion gave me the idea that it was basically a stylesheet problem, so then I delved into the monobook stylesheet. The odd thing about this bug is that it looks like there's plenty of blank space in an 800x600 res to fit in all the tabs, but nevertheless the display screws up by "wrapping" the tabs for some inexplicable reason. After studying the code for a while, I was able to locate the source of the problem:</p>
<pre>
#p-cactions {
...
    width: 76%;
...
}
</pre>
<p>The above line applies only to the tabs at the top of the page, and to no other elements on the page. The problem the width statement creates problems is that 76% of the width of a 800x600 screen is not enough to hold all the tabs. Therefore, I then changed my stylesheet by adding this line to my personal monobook.css page:</p>
<pre>
#p-cactions { width: 100%; }
</pre>
<p>Now the tabs display properly in an 800x600 resolution! (Even better: this change does not create problems—or even change the display at all—in larger resolutions. In fact, I don't understand why the stylesheet developers even chose to make the width 76% in the first place; unless I'm missing something, it should always have been 100%. 100% doesn't screw up the column to the left, either.)</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for the comments. You helped me find a solution.</p>

<p>Argg, okay, I spoke too soon. There <i>is</i> a slight problem with what I posted above, and now I see why the stylesheet developers chose to post a value less than 100%. It creates blank space to the right of the page, so that in an 800x600 res a horizontal scroll bar will appear at the bottom of the window. However, though 100% does not work, the following does (without being so wide as to create a horizontal scroll bar), and it fixes the stacking tabs problem.</p>
<pre>
#p-cactions { width: 80%; }
</pre>
<p>Now it works! (I think.)</p>

<dd>I'm not sure I'm in the position to document the problems sufficiently to give a helpful bug report. It's a very complex <a href="../../../c/o/n/Configuration_management.html" title="Configuration management">configuration management</a> problem IMO, and one that we're going to meet again as other features are added to the software. There have been other reports of strange behaviour that basically come down to poorly-tested modifications to the skin IMO, and for every one person who reports such problems there are probably ten to a hundred who experience them and say nothing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I hope that eventually we will restrict modifications to the default skin and a few others to developers only, and have an approval process by which all functional changes to these (even by developers) go through a public approval process. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 06:11, 24 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd thought what you said was that at 800x600 resolution, mozilla seamonkey takes 30 minutes to load any page with the monobook skin. So you could just point them to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/</a> (anon. -&gt; monobook skin) and tell that seamonkey takes ages to load at 800x600 resolution, specifying your OS (&amp; probably video card, etc.?) but firefox opens it fine. -- <a href="../../../p/a/d/User%7EPaddu_be1f.html" title="User:Paddu">Paddu</a> 08:36, 25 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think I see what you mean, but the problem is that this is not guaranteed to reproduce the problem, owing to the frequent changes to the monobook skin. The advantage of the classic skin is not any superior design IMO, it's simply the fact that people are leaving it alone, so bugs and other glitches have mostly been been fixed. There's a dichotomy here. People tend to fiddle with the default skin rather than one that is relatively little used, both because they use it themselves and also because it's the most important one. On the other hand, it's also the one we most want to be stable. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 23:51, 25 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>Thanks for the note. I don't know what to say about the whole deletion thread that brewed up last night, except that it seems quite a bit more exhausting to defend an article than it is to write one.</p>
<p>I apologize if I was over-ardent. The article really was the least of it: I write professionally, and there's a bit of ego that goes along with that, in terms of process and working on things until they're done -- an impulse to chase people away from one's workspace when one's in the middle of something.</p>
<p>Do these discussions happen often, or is the decision whether to delete an article usually pretty clear-cut? <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAuto_movil_93b4.html" title="User:Auto movil">Auto movil</a> 21:08, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd have to say that they happen far too often IMO! There has always been something of a problem. When I was fairly new here, I was following a trail I must resume someday, starting with a significant little booklet <i>How to Lie with Satistics</i> by <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darrell_Huff_8041.html" title="Darrell Huff">Darrell Huff</a>. Anyway, in writing one of those stubs I ran across a collaboration with another author, <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Felsen_2512.html" title="Henry Felsen">Henry Felsen</a>, who had sold over eight million children's books of a style we'd now consider politically incorrect I guess, so I wrote a stub on him too. He wasn't anyone I was particularly interested in, but he's clearly encyclopedic IMO, eight million book sales back in the 1940s and 1950s really meant something.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Six minutes after I started writing the stub it was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Henry_Felsen&amp;diff=1422641&amp;oldid=1422612" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Henry_Felsen&amp;diff=1422641&amp;oldid=1422612" rel="nofollow">vandalised</a> by a sysop and listed for deletion. When I reverted the vandalism, he just put it back. He also removed the wikilink from a list I'd added it to, with the explanation <i>remove unknown academic</i> or similar. When challenged he pointed out (correctly) that I'd mispelled the guy's name (a typo), and (also correctly) that a substub is a candidate for speedy deletion. The typo seems to be the only evidence he'd considered; The substub consisted of an external link to an archive of the guy's work (where the name was spelled correctly of course) and was not an orphan. He made no attempt to contact me.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The explanation that I'd made this typo was the closest I ever got to an apology, and I was criticised (rightly I guess but...!) for commenting <i>revert utter stupidity</i> when removing the vandalism of the substub I'd created and was in the middle of expanding (and having edit conflicts with the other guy of course). The sysop who comitted the vandalism was described as a <i>model Wikipedian</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So we've always had these problems and always will, but lately I see a few worrying trends. There are a couple of newer, rather aggressive sysops who are modelling behaviour that completely ignores the principle of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikilove_b832.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikilove">wikilove</a> in their <a href="../../../v/f/d/VfD_4d7f.html" title="VfD">VfD</a> work, and maybe it's my imagination but I think their attitude is spreading. These guys are also a bit trigger-happy, their output and enthusiasm is great but their research tends to be on the shallow side IMO - not that mine is always perfect.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, I hope you hang in here. The better writers tend to be the more polite in my experience, but probably also the more sensitive about their own work. I think that people who are careful of the truth tend to be careful of people too, and vice versa. And I think it's a great project, obviously, and despite various reasons <a href="../../../w/h/y/Wikipedia%7EWhy_Wikipedia_is_not_so_great_f7b4.html" title="Wikipedia:Why Wikipedia is not so great">why wikipedia is not so great</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 19:25, 21 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Andrew. I was just wondering where you got the figure for a 3GeV accelerator at Lucas Heights in your <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Atomic_Energy_Commission_6f69.html" title="Australian Atomic Energy Commission">Australian Atomic Energy Commission</a> article? I haven't heard of this accelerator but have heard of accelerators that they have there in the 3MeV range. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartyman_a0b9.html" title="User:Martyman">Martyman</a> 11:42, 25 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>G'day Martyman.</p>
<p>I'm going from memory, so I may have the energy wrong. When I worked there, there were two vandergraafs in service. The big one was a proton accelerator in the same building that housed MOATA reactor, and that's the one I'm describing as 3GeV.</p>
<p>The little one was an electron accelerator in a lab across the road, and was far less powerful in terms of particle energy.</p>
<p>The fascinating thing about the two was that although you could safely stand next to the big machine while it was operating (for short periods with a film badge), the little machine gave off such powerful hard X-rays that it needed four inches of lead!</p>
<p>But my area of expertise was computing, not particle physics. I'll see if I can find an old annual report to verify. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 17:50, 25 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>More info... the little vandergraaf was called the <i>betatron</i>, and the big one has now been replaced or extended to some sort of tandem configuration. This subsequent development belongs in the <a href="../../../a/n/s/ANSTO_59fd.html" title="ANSTO">ANSTO</a> article, not the <a href="../../../a/a/e/AAEC_4799.html" title="AAEC">AAEC</a> one I guess. MOATA was still there in the other end of the building but decommissioned and defuelled last I heard. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 20:29, 25 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I work at the Research School of Physical Sciences and Engineering at the <a href="../../../a/n/u/ANU_a8e0.html" title="ANU">ANU</a>. If it is a single ended vandergraf accelerator you are talking about then I am sure that the number is something like 3MeV. GeV would either require some method I haven't heard of or a large collider type accelerator sever kilometres accross. We had an old 1960s 2MeV vandergraf at work that was probably pretty similar to the one you are describing. The lack of electron supression made it an incredable producer of high energy X-Rays, much worse than the newer higher energy machine that have replaced it. I have a photo of our old 2Mev machine opened for servicing, here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:2mv_accelerator-MJC01.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:2mv_accelerator-MJC01.jpg" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</dd>

<dd>I attended a workshop with the ansto accelerator technitions recently. If I can recall correctly they currently have three accelerators. An old single ended vandergraf that is at the end of it's life, a new solid state tandem ("tandetron") commissioned this year to replace it and a large 3 or 4MV?? tandem vandergraph that was bought second hand from England and installed in around 1992. Interestingly our school used to have a very similar large tandem but it was shipped to new zealand.</dd>

<dd>I didn't realise that they used to have a second reactor. It must have been on a lot smaller scale to the HIFAR reactor? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartyman_a0b9.html" title="User:Martyman">Martyman</a> 21:52, 25 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I just opened up the powerpoint file from the lab overview talk I attended. The old Vandergraf that is close to being de-commissioned is a 3 MeV machine, the new machine is a 2 Million Volt tandem ("tandetron") called "STAR" and the big vandergraph machine is a 10 Million Volt tandem called "ANTARES". <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartyman_a0b9.html" title="User:Martyman">Martyman</a> 23:05, 25 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes. I've been going through AAEC Annual reports and what I most want is not very clearly set out, but it appears that the big vandergraf was a 3MeV proton accelerator, and was commissioned in 1964. So I was several orders of magnitude out! Thanks for the correction.</dd>

<dd>Sounds like the same old 3MeV accelerator that is still in use today.

<p>I fully respect you for stubifying the article, and your personal opinions. However, I feel criticising me for initially listing the article was a little over the top (although I can understand that people might not agree that the original article should have been speedy deleted). The initial article as it stood contravened <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> as it was solely a link, and being posted by an anoymous user I assumed it was spam/advertising (which, incidentally, it probably was).</p>

<p>Hi Andrew, I've just had a look at the article. This dormitory (<a href="http://www.wihast.at/panorama.en.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wihast.at/panorama.en.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> engl.) does not seem to be a particularly remarkable one of the (many) student homes in Vienna. Only one (rather unusual) dorm is mentionend in <a href="../../../../de/g/a/s/Gasometer_%28Wien%29_4db2.html" class="extiw" title="de:Gasometer_(Wien)">de:Gasometer (Wien)</a>, I don't understand why the "Haus Panorama" deserves its own article. --<a href="../../../m/h/2/User%7EMh26_c35b.html" title="User:Mh26">Markus</a> 20:05, 17 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey, I'm just responding to your comment you left me in my Talk:Echidnae page. I see that the Ceciliantas page has been deleted, and looking back now, I think that was a good move. I'll remember what you have said to me, as I'm still learning how to use Wikipedia in the best way. I've been away on vacation for some time now, so it's been hard to get any amount of work done online in Wikipedia. I just thought I should let you know why my input on Wikipedia has been minimal for now. I do plan to get more involved when I get back home, as long as I have time I can devote towards it. Thanks for all your comments and replies to mine. Being new here, I like all of the feedback I can get. --<a href="../../../e/c/h/User%7EEchidnae_af17.html" title="User:Echidnae">Echidnae</a> 05:07, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

My reason for including it here was not simply that it was a pet project that I wanted help with, but that it was really a project which belonged to the Wikipedia community. Perhaps such requests should be on a separate page, but I didn't know whether such a page existed. The name "requests for comment" seemed to fit. If you can think of a better alternative, please let me know. Thanks.

<p>Hey Andrew... I removed it because it made what was previously part of the intro into the beginning of the main body of the text - I dunno if you did that on purpose, but I think it would be better simply as part of the intro, or else lower down in the main body if you think it needs to be expanded into its own section. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGraft_fc33.html" title="User:Graft">Graft</a> 06:07, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't particularly want to pile on Iasson, and I'm not really sure who created the article, but why wasn't it ever proposed for VfD? I don't want to step into a s--tstorm by proposing it, but my current hypothesis regarding Iasson's behavior is that he is in fact the creator of the Average Rule and is hoping to get Wikipedia to be the first organization in the universe actually to adopt it. It seems to me to be a neologism that's in no real use. I have this page temporarily on my watchlist if you want to reply here. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 18:31, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think you mean average rule (no capital r). Interesting theory, I'd encourage you to pursue it, as will I. As for s--tstorms, sometimes they're inevitable. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 18:43, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, on reading the article and its talk page, it seems a definite VfD candidate on the grounds of <i>original research</i>. Some of the content is also disputable IMO, much of the material submitted by anons uses similar phrasing to Iasson, and it seems to cover most (perhaps all) of the points he has been making in commenting in the RfC. That's consistent with your theory.</dd>

<dd>Well, I see someone beat me to it. I wanted to wait to see what other editors to that page had said. As for the "eleven other articles" I suspect they will not be too hard to find—many of them will probably prove to be linked from his other articles—and his style is easily recognizable. It may even be able to find some of them by global text search. I don't think there will be many of them because—at least so far—I don't perceive that he created these articles out of hostility toward Wikipedia. I think he is just a little monomaniacal about his proposed voting systems. The most antisocial thing about him is his apparent unwillingness, no matter how clearly expressed, to accept group decisions, however obvious, when arrived at by any means other than his own. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 14:10, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I'm sorry I only just found out about your response <a href="../../../p/a/p/Talk%7EPapua_%28Indonesian_province%29_db5a.html#Response_to_request_for_peer_review" title="Talk:Papua (Indonesian province)">Request for peer review</a> a few hours ago; unfortunately you'd posted your thoughts just one day after I left Wikipedia; the mindless reverting of Wik's &amp; John's had made it impossible to contribute to any subjects on Wikipedia. - so I left for several months in hopes they'd be delt with or find something else to amuse them.</p>
<p>You comments were just the kind of feedback I was hoping to get before they started their edit &amp; revert attacks last year.

<p>Greetings, and many thank yous for your support and advice regarding my series of Height pages. I hadn't the slightest clue this was going to be so controversial! I'm still having trouble getting into the minds of my attackers. Why does this upset them so? Thanks for the format suggestion for the six-foot-three page. I've adopted it as the future standard. Now, if I could only re-format the ones created beforehand... Anyway, I hope to win a few more comrades before the axe comes down on Thursday. Perhaps extending the upper range would help? 6'6", 6'7", etc.</p>
