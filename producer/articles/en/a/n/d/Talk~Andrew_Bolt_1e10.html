<p>I just changed the bit at the end that calls his forum 'interactive journalism' to interactive discussion. This seems a lot more appropriate. I also changed 'an' to 'a'. Somebody wrote 'an' when they shouldn't have... Uh... Yeah... <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkSideOfTheSpoon_41b1.html" title="User:DarkSideOfTheSpoon">DarkSideOfTheSpoon</a> 00:17, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>(1) Oops, that "an" was probably me. (2) I called it "interactive journalism" because Bolt is using the forum for feedback and discussion concerning published columns, and suggestions for new columns. (I would have given examples if only the @(&amp;*^#! forum software used <a href="../../../p/e/r/Permalink.html" title="Permalink">permalinks</a>.) I think it's significant the readers are discussing the columns with Bolt as well as with other; that's what makes it more than an "<a href="../../../l/e/t/Letter_to_the_editor.html" title="Letter to the editor">emails to the editor</a>" page.) (3) Bolt is doing "internet-enabled journalism" in another way: he gets material from (or rather <i>via</i>) blogs. So, while I wasn't all that happy with my original wording, I still think we could do better. Ideas <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">and edits</a> welcome. —<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_Chittleborough_4a64.html" title="User:Chris Chittleborough">Chris Chittleborough</a> 10:33, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmmm... I don't know if chatting with his readers is a form of journalism. That is why I changed it. You can write "internet enabled journalism" to describe the act of him using the discussion board as a source of news, but I don't think at its base level it should be described as journalism though. Whatever but, you can make it whatever you feel is right.&#160;:) <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkSideOfTheSpoon_41b1.html" title="User:DarkSideOfTheSpoon">DarkSideOfTheSpoon</a> 04:49, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>Now let me explain why I wrote that.</p>
<p>When it started in May 2005, Bolt's forum was a pioneering experiment in a journalist-turned-columnist using the internet to interact with readers. At that stage, very few newspapers had done more than publish email addresses and accept <a href="../../../l/e/t/Letters_to_the_Editor_f257.html" title="Letters to the Editor">Letters to the Editor</a> via email. I know of at least one newspaper that was ahead of Bolt, the <a href="http://www.knoxviews.com/node/779" class="external text" title="http://www.knoxviews.com/node/779" rel="nofollow"><i>Knoxville News-Sentinel</i></a> in Tennessee, but I'm not aware of any others.</p>
<p>Actually, I suspect that the low-budget approach was important to getting the forum started relatively early: while other newspapers thought about creating an ambitious IT project, Bolt and the Herald-Sun just pulled something off a shelf and got stuck in. The down-side is that the forum doesn't have <a href="../../../p/e/r/Permalinks.html" title="Permalinks">permalinks</a>, which makes sustained discussion <b>much</b> harder.</p>
<p>Re the discussion above about whether the forum is "journalism": it's really "writing a column", which (1) <i>is</i> a kind of journalism but (2) is <i>not</i> the first thing "journalism" brings to mind. I've tried to think of something better and failed ("interactive op-ed journalism"? "interactive column-writing"?). Comments, ideas and edits all welcome!</p>

<p>I'm not quite sure how you can call what Bolt does with his forum "journalism". Largely, it's just a glorified letters-page in which Bolt responds to his critics with a scathing "you're obviously a hate-filled lefty" retort, and to his supporters with an incredibly profound "Thanks, Mike." Hardly journalism. And hardly "pioneering". Plenty of other media organisations had online letters-pages and "fora" long before Bolt.</p>
<p>I just don't think the sentence adds anything to the entry. It's impossible to demonstrate whether it's "pioneering" or not, and more importantly, it doesn't add anything of substance to the wikipedia entry. The paragraph describes the forum in sufficient detail already. Surely that's enough. Mrlefty 02:18, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>One level at most.</p>

<p>And just the same, Boltwatchwatch is the place to go for critisism of Boltwatch and we are not going to create a Boltwacth article, so this is the place for it. It is either both or neither.

<dd>As you point out, there is no BoltWatch entry on Wikipedia. If there were, then by all means include the BoltWatchWatch link as "a place to go for criticism of BoltWatch". In the meantime, Bolt's blog is linked, appropriately. One critical site (I'd suggest the most significant critical site relating to Bolt) is mentioned. That should be it. If User: Xtra's stance is accepted, then the article would be weighed down with countless versions of "watch" blogs. It would be ridiculous.</dd>

<dd>The situation with ONE response blog provides balance. (The Andrew Bolt side is clearly amply represented by Bolt's blog itself.) Watch blogs of subjects are appropriate on Wikipedia (if longstanding and consistent) but not watch blogs of watch blogs.Garth M 07:48, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>BoltWatch is, as CWC has pointed out, the primary source for responses to Bolt's articles. Of course it's relevant. Wikipedia's NPOV policy involves including links from both sides of a political divide. In this case, there's the Bolt side, and the non-Bolt side. Bolt's blog is included as representative of the Bolt side. BW is included as representative of the non-Bolt side. (Although, in fairness, it's more "critical" in the real sense of the word than "anti-".)</dd>
<dd>BWW is simply an extra, unnecssary layer. Its function is perfectly taken up by Bolt's blog itself. In fact, its author regularly posts his remarks about BW to Bolt's actual blog. Clearly, BWW does not provide information or criticism in Bolt's favour which cannot already be found in the two already-existing links. Thus, its inclusion is neither necessary nor deserved. (Note: this dispute has only arisen because "niceperson" (Iain Hall), the owner of that blog, recently created a wikipedia account to add it to the Andrew Bolt entry.)</dd>
<dd>Finally, if user Xtra's philosophy were adopted, Wikipedia would then have to include a BoltWatchWatchWatch blog, then a BoltWatchWatchWatchWatch blog, and so on. Obviously a line has to be drawn somewhere. I'd argue it should be drawn at ONE blog critical of the subject, provided there's a "pro" site to argue in the subject's favour.</dd>
<dd>Wikipedia should only be including links which are directly relevant to the subject of an article. Not merely relevant to another site about the subject of an article. BoltWatch is about Andrew Bolt. BoltWatchWatch is about BoltWatch. The former should be included on a wikipedia article about Andrew Bolt. The latter should only be included if there were a wikipedia article about BoltWatch. (Which there isn't, and which there shouldn't be.) Garth M 22:30, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No-one has objected to linking to <a href="http://boltwatch.blogspot.com/" class="external free" title="http://boltwatch.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://boltwatch.blogspot.com/</a>, so I'll claim we've reached consensus on one question.</p>
<p>Now for the harder question: should we link to <a href="http://boltwatch-watch.blogspot.com/" class="external free" title="http://boltwatch-watch.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://boltwatch-watch.blogspot.com/</a>&#160;? It seems to me that the key issue is relevance. For example, would a Wikipedia reader who had never heard of Andrew Bolt learn something useful <b>about Mr Bolt</b> from reading BWW? (Clearly the reader would learn that Bolt has an energetic defender, but that's neither suprising nor all that useful.)</p>
<p>I don't read BWW (or BW!) regularly, but a quick skim of the current front page of BWW indicates that BWW does discuss Bolt, but not as much as it discusses BW and allied blogs So I'm currently quite neutral on this question. OTOH, I just emailed the BWW blogger to tell him about this discussion.</p>
<p>There is a reason for not linking BWW which at lease Wikipedia editor will care deeply about: linking BWW will make it much harder "Mr Lefty" to stay anonymous. However, (1) Bolt has also revealed Mr Lefty's name and occupation on his blog (as have many other Australian bloggers) and (2) this issue is not relevant to Wikipedia.</p>

<p>For what its worth, I tend to think that a link to Boltwatch is not in the spirit of NPOV. I feel that Boltwatch is very singular POV. Surely any criticisms of Andrew Bolt could be found via more mainstream and, lets face it, reliable sources. No offense Mr Lefty, but you commenting on Andrew bolt here as well as your own blog seems a little against the spirit of the wikipedia guidlines. im sure there are plenty of people who find Andrew Bolts articles to be worthy of criticism. However, having said all that, I also find it interesting that anyone could find Andrew Bolt worthy of an "Anti" site.

<dd>There aren't any citations in the ambulance section. Also, the text "unsubstantiated and questionable", "confirming" lean towards supporting a certain opinion. If someone hasn't heard of blogs before and want to know how reliable they are, they can go to the entry on blogs. Noting that The Australian "spared" stablemate Bolt is at this stage original research - the editorial didn't criticise Tim Blair either, and he worked for Packer. Another thing that needs citation: "and is a relentless critic of ABC broadcaster Phillip Adams" (Adams isn't just ABC - he also writes for News Ltd). <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndjam_08d6.html" title="User:Andjam">Andjam</a> 14:57, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've addressed those issues you raise. The exception is my line about Adams being a frequent target of Bolt, a claim that, yes, is an observation and for which there is probably little external written evidence, apart from numerous mentions at Blair's blog etc. Is it original research to make this claim? Is it any more original than naming TV programs on which Bolt appears, or naming his wife?

<dd>Uh, what's your point here? I'll check the clipping of his actual column when I get a chance, but as I recall his column about the ambulance incident used a picture taken from the Zombietime website. That website, as discussed at <a href="../../../m/r/m/User_talk%7EMrMonroe_666a.html" title="User talk:MrMonroe">User talk:MrMonroe</a>, was the primary source of his comments that day. Whether those pictures were subsequently, or earlier, available through AP is immaterial: out of the dozens of images AP would have supplied to newspapers following the incident, Bolt selected one that appeared at Zombietime. Why? Because ZT had already formulated the theory and assembled the evidence that he then used in his column, and to which Downer had referred a day or two earlier.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Prester John's comments urging that the noting the use of AP images "be given priority" suggest a wish to give Bolt's comments that day some additional authenticity or validity.

<dd>Please note that zombie's essay (<a href="http://www.zombietime.com/fraud/ambulance/" class="external free" title="http://www.zombietime.com/fraud/ambulance/" rel="nofollow">http://www.zombietime.com/fraud/ambulance/</a>) uses photos <b>from MSM websites</b>, <a href="../../../g/e/t/Getty_Images_8640.html" title="Getty Images">Getty Images</a>, etc. It does not use photos zombie took.

<dd>As I've explained at <a href="../../../m/r/m/User_talk%7EMrMonroe_666a.html" title="User talk:MrMonroe">User talk:MrMonroe</a>, <b>Bolt did not use zombietime as a source</b> in the journalistic (or Wikipedia) sense of the word. That is, he did not think "hey, I know that the ambulance story was a hoax <b>because some unknown person on a website says so</b>"; he read zombie's analysis, checked it against the accompanying photos from news services and <b>decided that zombie was right</b>. And of course, zombie (and Bolt, and Downer) were both right about the ambulances not being hit by missiles, as the Red Cross and Human Rights Watch have both since conceded.</dd>

<dd>Chris, your histrionic posting and edit summary that includes the line <i>"The Red Cross lied; deal with it"</i> strongly suggest that you "appear to be pushing an agenda or a biased point of view" as described at <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>.

<dd>OK, I have the column of August 30, "Not the hole truth." Here's what Bolt said about where he gained the information for his column: "The bloggers -- notably an American one known as Zombietime, whose research I've drawn on -- dug out other damning photographs." And later: "See the complete evidence on www.zombietime.com/fraud/ambulance." I hope this clears this up.</dd>

<dd>First of all guys, please don't make accusations and comments about each other.</dd>
<dd>I've read this page and Mr Monroe's talk page as linked above and it looks like there's some confusion about the journalistic meaning of "source", particular as it pertains to the Australian news media. A source may mean either the person or document that provides a journalist with information. As far as this Bolt matter goes, I think it is quite clear that the zombietime.com article was a source. If Andrew read "zombie's analysis, checked it against the accompanying photos from news services and decided that zombie was right," then zombietime.com was definitely a journalistic source. Taking the information and verifying it's validity does not diminish its status as an original source. I disagree with speculating about how Andrew got his information and how he processed it because, unless Andrew says that's what he did, it's just your opinion. Further, unless you can quote a reliable source, it is not appropriate to authoritatively declare that "Bolt did not use zombietime as a source" because you can't know that and most of the time we <i>never</i> know a journalist's sources. <b>Sarah</b> 05:26, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>All editors should note that <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> <b>does not</b> discourage us from "adopting 'a sympathetic point of view' on" the subject of articles. On the contrary, <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> almost <b>requires</b> editors to write from a sympathetic point of view. The warning against being too sympathetic relates to <i>style</i>, not <i>content</i>. It's the last sentence of the section headed "Writing style"(!):</p>
<dl>
<dd>The writing style should be neutral, factual, and understated, avoiding both a sympathetic point of view and an <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advocacy_journalism.html" title="Advocacy journalism">advocacy journalism</a> point of view.</dd>
</dl>
<p>All editors should be familiar with the caveats in <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> about criticism of living people. "Write from a sympathetic point of view" is a useful guideline, though it leaves out many important details of a complex policy.</p>
<p>In journalism, the word "source" can mean someone from whom I obtained information ("Jo said Fred Nurks told he witnessed the explosion") <i>or</i> someone whose statements are credible because he or she has relevant first-hand knowledge or recognised expertise. There's an important difference between "I'm saying X <i>because Mr S says so</i>" and "I'm saying X <i>because photograph 1 shows X1</i> and <i>photographs 2 and 3 show X2</i> — by the way, I am indebted to Mr S for pointing this out". Let's call the second category an "authoritative source". Bolt did not use "zombie" as an authoritative source. How do I know this? It's clear to anyone who reads Bolt's "Not the whole truth" column.<a href="http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/column_not_the_whole_truth/" class="external autonumber" title="http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/column_not_the_whole_truth/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Here's the relevant text (many short paragraphs folded into one big one; otherwise verbatim):</p>
<dl>
<dd>Soon some bloggers, the media watchdogs of the internet, looked closer and saw something very odd. Check the pictures on this page. You could even see where the screws went. What’s more, the damaged parts of the roof were mottled with the rust of ages. The bloggers—notably an American one known as Zombietime, whose research I’ve drawn on—dug out other damning photographs. A side view of the ambulance, revealing the interior, showed no sign of fire or explosion, or anything to indicate a missile had slammed through the roof and landed . . . where? There was not even a dent in the floor. The front windscreen was collapsed inwards, not outwards as you’d expect from an explosion that had blown up an ambulance and taken off a patient’s leg, and the side windows were intact. There was more. Chaalan, the medic last seen lying in hospital with thick bandages over his chin and ear, was filmed some six days later giving another interview. But this time he had no bandages—and the skin once covered by them had no scratch, scab, scar or even stain. A fast healer.</dd>
</dl>
<p>So Bolt is acknowledging that he has used zombie's research, but he is arguing from the facts presented by zombie, not <b>relying on</b> zombie as an <b>authority</b>. That column appeared online 30-Aug-2006 at 06:06am. Bolt subsequently wrote at least 3 blog posts (I haven't done a comprehensive search):</p>

<dd>At risk of further inflaming this disagreement with Chris Chittleborough, I'm intrigued by his comment on feb 12 that Human Rights Watch and Red Cross have conceded that the ambulances weren't hit by missiles. A report from HRW at <a href="http://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/mena/qana1206/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/mena/qana1206/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> states unambiguously and strenuously that this was not a hoax; that the ambulances <i>were</i> hit by Israeli missiles. I haven't yet discovered the Red Cross "concession" he refers to. On this basis, it seems Chris Chittleborough has written patently false statements in support of his edits which are becoming increasingly biased.</dd>

<dd>I don't mean to distract attention from the discussion here, however: the Bolt Wiki entry as it stands validly includes reference to his column, his sources and the reaction to it.

<p><b>Response from "CWC"</b><br />
While the Red Cross's initial press release was quite vague, media reports quoted Lebanese Red Cross workers saying that the Israelis had hit two ambulances with <i>missiles</i> fired from <i>jet fighters</i> (ie., not from UAVs). Within a day or so, the workers were saying that the ambulances were hit by <i>bullets</i> from <i>UAVs</i>.<a href="http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/fake_but_true_the_age_defends_the_holey_ambulance_hoax/" class="external autonumber" title="http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/fake_but_true_the_age_defends_the_holey_ambulance_hoax/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> These stories are contradictory; at least one is a lie. The HRW went for a third story: Israel might be developing some special-purpose missiles, might have working or production models, might have deployed them on drones that might have been used in Lebanon, and might have wasted those extremely expensive munitions on ambulances. That contradicts both stories from the Red Cross workers. Therefore the HRW strongly implies that those guys were lying both times.</p>
<p>Some questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Was it balanced to imply that Downer and Bolt called the early reports a hoax because they were mindlessly echoing some unknown guy with an internet website?</li>
<li>Was it balanced to quote Kevin Rudd's questions at length but not point out that the chronology and Downer's doorstop contradicted the insinuation that Downer was mindlessly echoing Bolt?</li>
<li>Was it encyclopedic to mention Bolt's 30-Aug-2006 column but not link to it?</li>
<li>Is it acceptable to insinuate that Bolt got his thinking from an anonymous American, but not mention his detailed argument or that he wrote multiple other articles which did not rely on zombietime?</li>
<li>Is it NPOV to quote from and link to an attack on Bolt by Mark Dodd, but not even mention Bolt's strong response?</li>
<li>Is it NPOV to mention Martin Chulov's story but not Bolt's response?</li>
</ol>
<p>I contend that the answer to all these questions is definitely "NO". That section of the article violated several key Wikipedia policies, including <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> (especially the "undue weight" section), and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Furthermore, until I fixed it, it omitted crucial facts and implicitly smeared Bolt and Downer as mindless parrots of other people's propaganda. The version recently reverted to still suggests a conspiracy between Bolt and Downer.</p>
<p>It is quite fitting for each and every one of us to "decide the truth or otherwise of the ambulance incident." Indeed, intellectual honesty demands it. It is quite OK to have a POV, even a strong one; the problem comes when you insert your POV into an <i>article</i> (as distinct from talk pages, edit summaries, etc) in violation of Wikipedia rules. (That last clause matters. It's OK to insert verifiable, notable, cited statements that you happen to agree with.) I have tried to keep my POV out of all the articles I edit, even <a href="../../../j/o/c/Jochen_Liedtke_b3b4.html" title="Jochen Liedtke">Jochen Liedtke</a>.)</p>
<p>I think that the stuff about the ambulance hoax part in the article now has only one fault: it is way too long. If anyone sees any problems I've missed, please correct them. If anyone sees a good way to shorten the current text, please do so.

<dd>(Yawn). So you lied about Red Cross and Human Rights Watch "conceding" the ambulance wasn't hit by missiles. They say black; you read between the lines and say they <i>really</i> meant white. You're obviously incapable of rational debate. My guess is that you go through life shouting at and threatening people who disagree with you (witness your ridiculous posting on my talk page) until they get so worn down they just give up.

<dd>The description of Captain Blyth's comments are accurate: it was Bolt who had claimed in his news report that he had refused to sign a confession. From page 92 to 94 Blyth deals with his encounters with Bolt. Page 94: "Contrary to his account, Bolt signed an apology" .... "A Reuters report, quoting Mr Li saying that Bolt had signed a statement admitting that his story was 'seriously inconsistent with facts', was true. Bolt's irresponsible and inaccurate reports were faxed all around South-East Asian embassies and consulates and did a lot of damage. I would say that the hostility they aroused set relations between me and the Chinese officials back a certain distance." .... "Luckily, Bolt was not believed."</dd>

<p>Andrew Bolt mentioned this article <a href="http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/wikipeddler_of_smears/" class="external text" title="http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/wikipeddler_of_smears/" rel="nofollow">on his blog</a> yesterday, and specifically said that our description of his involvment in the <i>Petro Ranger</i> incident was "a falsehood". (Read his replies to two of the comments, as well as the post itself.)</p>
<p>I edited the section to link to Bolt's denial, and quote from it. Then it struck me that 3 paragraphs of Blyth-said/Bolt-said is probably at least two too many. I've moved <i>my updated version</i> of the material here for discussion.</p>
<dl>
<dd>In 2000 Bolt’s accuracy and honesty as a journalist was challenged in a book written by Ken Blyth, the captain of an oil tanker which was seized by pirates in the South China Sea. Bolt has strongly denied parts of Blyth's account.<a href="http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/wikipeddler_of_smears/" class="external autonumber" title="http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/wikipeddler_of_smears/" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In <i>Petro Pirates</i>, Ken Blyth relates how his vessel, the MT Petro Ranger, along with all crew, was detained by Chinese authorities in <a href="../../../h/a/i/Haikou.html" title="Haikou">Haikou</a> Harbour in April and May 1998 after the pirates were apprehended. Blyth wrote that in May Bolt (then a journalist in News Ltd’s Hong Kong bureau) arrived beside the tanker in a sampan. The pair, separated by about 10 metres, had a brief shouted conversation, Blyth warning that Bolt risked being shot by the Chinese soldiers guarding the Petro Ranger. Blyth rejects as fanciful Bolt’s published claim{{cn}} that he had yelled: "For God's sake don't come on board or they'll shoot us all", denies he asked for a message to be passed to his wife and says he did not ask Bolt to contact Foreign Affairs in Australia for him.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Bolt returned to the tanker the next day, but was intercepted by a military patrol boat and escorted to Haikou for questioning. Blyth claims the reality did not match Bolt’s brave tale in his later articles. He disputes that soldiers on board the tanker fired over Bolt’s head as he tried to flee in his boat (crewmen on the vessel told Blyth soldiers fired up in the air); he also disputes that Bolt refused to sign a confession that he had made up his earlier story. Blyth claims Bolt did sign a statement admitting his story was "seriously inconsistent with facts" and wrote an apology. Bolt claims he "signed a statement agreeing that what <i>Blyth had told me</i> about the hijacking of his ship was seriously inconsistent with what the Chinese navy and police told me" (Bolt's emphasis).<a href="http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/wikipeddler_of_smears/" class="external autonumber" title="http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/wikipeddler_of_smears/" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> Blyth claims Bolt’s "irresponsible and inaccurate" reports worsened his situation and led to tighter security than he had been experiencing.</dd>

<p>Questions we should consider: Is Ken Blyth a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">Reliable Source</a>? Is this incident <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> enough to take up this much space in the article? Is it notable at all?</p>

<dl>
<dd>Blyth's comments strike me as reasonable. A ship's captain isn't exactly some Joe Blow who wanders in and makes some slanderous comment about someone without reason. He wrote about Bolt because Bolt blundered into his life and then endangered it. Of course Bolt is going to deny it. I don't know why you;re so keen to protect him from criticism, or why you think Bolt's denial carries more weight that Blyth's accusation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>At the heart of Blyth's comment is the accusation that Bolt can be liberal with the truth. That strikes me as pretty damn relevant to a high-profile newspaper columnist who makes a career out of expressing his opinions about other people.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The best way of treating this is to include Blyth's remarks and Bolt's denial -- hopefully a little less long-winded than he did it on his blog.165.69.111.38 14:22, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have trimmed down Blyth's accusations and reinstated them to the main article. Bolt's denial and the link to this is retained. MrMonroe 03:22, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have reinstated the image of the Petro Pirates book. If you want it removed, can you please discuss the reasons? So far just one objection has been raised, but I'm not sure it's strong enough to delete the book cover.</p>
<p>The issue of the <i>relevance</i> of images on articles isn't something I can find a clear answer to at Wikipedia, so I have begun a discussion at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia_talk%7EImage_use_policy_f4bb.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Image use policy">Wikipedia talk:Image use policy</a> in the hope it may generate some comment. Please feel free to say what you think there ... or here, of course. I've explained at that discussion why I think the image should be used, but reasonable man that I am, I'm open to debate.MrMonroe 00:38, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The author is non-notable. The book is non-notable. A Google Scholar search gets <a href="../../../z/e/r/Zero.html" title="Zero">zero</a> hits.The only results a classic google search pull up refer to this wiki entry or a answers.com page about Andrew Bolt. Bolt as repudiated the claims in the book. The image is a case of <i>guerilla marketing</i> in an attempt to drive up some exposure. This is no way this should be the only image in an article about Andrew Bolt. <a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPrester_John_b251.html" title="User:Prester John">Prester John</a> 01:18, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've removed the image. I disagree with you about the notability of the author, however. The story was front-page news in Australia when it happened, and Bolt gained great exposure for it. If the subject of those articles later claimed Bolt's account was fanciful, then that certainly becomes relevant in an article about Bolt. This has little reference to the cover pic, however, and I've removed it after just brief discussion at the Image Use talk page. MrMonroe 01:28, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
