<dd>According to Fermat's Enigma, Wiles had a fairly large paper (or two) ready for publishing when he began on the Fermat work. To remain "active" in the mathematical world, he split up the paper into several smaller papers and published them separately over the years of his Fermat work. —<a href="../../../d/c/c/User%7EDcclark_7822.html" title="User:Dcclark">dcclark</a> (<a href="../../../d/c/c/User_talk%7EDcclark_f94f.html" title="User talk:Dcclark">talk</a>) 07:46, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I did a bunch more rewriting, and removed the following section, which was so confused I decided we were better off without it:</p>
<p>The problem was how do you count and it was the big question on the subject. Wiles introduced the correct counting technique. Wiles converted elliptic curves by their j-invariant to their corresponding Galois representation to study elliptic curves. He did studies on representations according to partations and said in his paper on this, "suppose for the moment that <span class="texhtml"><i>p</i><sub>3</sub></span> is irreducible". He tells us why 3 is important.</p>
<p>He found a surprising link between <b><a href="../../../g/a/l/Galois_representation.html" title="Galois representation">Galois representations</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modular_forms.html" title="Modular forms">modular forms</a></b> and the interpretation of special values of <a href="../../../l/-/f/L-functions.html" title="L-functions">L-functions</a>.

<p>In the side box with title "The bridge between Fermat and Taniyama", it is mentioned that p should an odd prime. But in Fermat's theorem, any integer would do, which is more general condition. Thus it is inaccurate to say that hypothetical elliptic curve, the Frey curve, must exist if there is a counterexample to Fermat's Last Theorem. For example, if we found a counter example to Fermat's theorem with p=10, it does not satisfy the required condition for Frey curve, since 10 in not an odd prime number. --Sandipani 01:55, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Every power of 10 is also a power of 5, an odd prime. So proving Fermat on every odd prime proves it on all integers except powers of 2. I suppose there's a separate froof for the latter, discovered before Wiles's work. 80.235.60.165 19:04, 28 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>"Every power of 10 is also a power of 5". Well... 100 is a integer power of 10, but isn't a integer power of 5.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>It's enough to verify FLT for exponents <i>n</i> that are an odd prime, or 4. That's <i>a fortiori</i> (no sum of cubes is a cube, so no sum of 99th powers is even a cube, let alone a 99th power). The exponent 4 was done by Fermat and/or Euler. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 19:28, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I know that this is a really crazy idea. I know that this will probably be horrifically unpopular to anyone with common sense (save, perhaps, fans of 'Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy'....But, given the audacious complexity of the FLT proof, given that there were mistakes made when it was intially published, given the small number of people (as a proportion of the human race, if not just in absolute numbers) who understand the FLT, given the prize money that has been at least suggested as a reward for FLT - is it not possibly, slightly (but not too slight) likely as it is conceivably possible and probable that there may be a small flaw in the proof that an automated theorem prover might be capable of picking up on? That is, has anyone run FLT through a computer for objective assessment?</p>
<p>Again, I re-iterate the notion that *this is a crazy suggestion*, and I probably don't know what I'm talking about (though enough to know that I don't understand the proof to FLT and need some Hitchhikian computer to blurt out '42' to convince me....). Further, this notion would probably not just concern the proof to FLT, but many areas of mathematics which very few people understand, but where 'obvious' and 'intuitive' assertions are relied upon.</p>

Dear Wackydough, It's certainly true that there are papers in the Mathematical literature which have been published, and then mistakes have been found years later. These are typically proofs which are either unclearly expressed or obscure. However, every detail of this proof has been poured over, initially by a small group of experts, and more recently by the wider Number Theory community. Although technical, it is a clearly expressed and checkable proof, and it would really be quite remarkable if any mistake were still overlooked. At a minimum, several hundred people are now able to understand the proof, and it is in the public domain. Even though this is a small fraction of the population, it is still too large and diverse a group of people for a conpiracy theory to be plausible. In fact, there would be strong incentive (in terms of kudos) for anyone who could have found a mistake. Furthermore, many researchers have been producing further results in this area recently, and it would be astonishing if they had not noticed a flaw in their follow-up research (and their follow-up research involves a considerable amount of going back through the techniques, and does not merely quote Wiles' results). Several more accessible versions of the proof have been published, and there is already a new generation of Number Theory PhD students and postdocs who have read the proof. I don't know anyone in the academic community (which is exceptionally cautious about these things) who has any doubts about the proof. As far as "automated theorem provers" go (or perhaps you mean "automated proof checkers" in this case), I'm afraid that we are way, way, way, way, ...... (you can add another few ways, if you like) below the level where these would be of any help. A substantial proof in Mathematics is expressed in sentences of normal language, embellished with technical terms, equations and references to previous lemmas (smaller preparatory results). There is no "proof checker" which comes even remotely close to being able to read a research article in Mathematics and check it. Attempting to re-express the proof in terms of a sequence of computer-checkable elementary steps would make the proof mind-bogglingly long (too long for this strategy to be viable). Anyway, I hope the above is of some use to you! Best regards, Victor.</p>

<p>Why is Andrew Wiles listed as being an American? He is from Britain, and his nationality is British, so where did this information come from? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_142.231.110.50_0286.html" title="Special:Contributions/142.231.110.50">142.231.110.50</a> (talk) 23:51, 15 February 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
