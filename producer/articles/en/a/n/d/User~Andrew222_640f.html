	    <p>Andrew Reid, a famous musician, is on the verge of creating another smash hit. He is an unknown artist and but he is known for many things in his town. He plays the trumpet and his side burns (some call them side-slickers or side-slugs) are foot long inch thick. His biography:</p>
<p>[[ Child hood]]</p>
<p>As a child he has went though many different adventures. In 4th grade he used to untie shoes during reading time and look for ways to distract others. In the winters he would go sledding but he was the slave. As he was going up the sled hill his friend would ask him if he could bring it up. He would not do it so his friend broke off a tree limb (pine) and started whipping him on the back with it like he was a mule. Andrew was scared for life but it has built him good character and endurance. Through his quest throughout life he has endured many more tortures and adventures. One time when he was at the Indian fort in the woods, that him and his friends had built, while he was trying to build a little tee-pee house he got accidentally stabbed by a rusty nail. As he was taking it down his friend ripped it off causing a bored with a nail sticking out to strike him in the wrist. He was lucky he had his tetanus shot or he could have gotten tetanus, an infection generally occurs through wound contamination, and often involves a cut or deep puncture wound. As the infection progresses, muscle spasms in the jaw develop and the autonomic nervous system may also be affected. When he was a kid he also wanted to see if battery acid was strong. So he and his friend took a cinder block and put an AA battery on top of it. He took a huge rock and slammed the battery until the acid came out. The next time he hit the cinder block with the rock, it snapped in half! One time his friends were really mad at him so they chased him through the woods. As he was running they got some rope and cornered him. They tied him to the sappiest tree and tried to give him water torture. They dripped water on his head slowly and steadily until he went insane. They eventually let him go after a while and he ran home like a buffalo. Also he was one of the testers of his friends many crazy ideas and inventions. One of the best inventions was "sidewalk sledding". They took a skate board and put a sled on top of it. Two people would go on it, one in the front and one in the back. The front part of the skate board was connected to a Tonka truck (the steering), and the back hung off the back a little bit. If they wanted to stop the back person would lean back and the sled would slide across the ground causing it to stop or they would just run the contraption into the grass causing the skateboard to stop and the sled to fly off it into the grass. Andrew got some injuries during the testing but it was one of the most successful inventions. Other inventions that didn't work out to well were: bike-roller blading, double scooters, lugging, Tonka racing, and parachute biking. Here I will explain what each thing was. Bike-roller blading had 2 forms: rope and bouncy rope. When he and his friend first did it they used a jump rope to connect the rollerblader to the back of the bike seat. The biker would petal and the rollerblader would hold onto the rope and get whipped around. As time progressed they added to the event and they used this retractable rope thing, kind of like a bungee cord. This added a lot of whip to the rider and accelerated the rollerblader as the biker took turns. Double scooters was just using two scooters, one for each foot. Lugging was lying on your back on a skateboard while flying down a steep hill. Tonka racing, one of his favorites, was actually sitting on the Tonka truck as it went down a hill. If you had one of the Tonka’s that had a hinge on it, you could turn it. Last but not least was parachute biking. In this we took a ton of plastic bags and taped them together with 4 strings that came off them and connected to the guy on the bike. We tried to use it to help the biker stop faster, but it wasn't really successful. One of the best games him and his friends invented was salt the slug. There’s one person who is the salter, and he is armed with a pillow. The rest of the people are the slugs and they go in their sleeping bag. As they go around the salter hits them on the head, back and everywhere. The slugs try to wrestle the salter to the ground and then they become the salter. There is violence involved in this game and not many rules. The major rules are no looking around if you’re the slug and let the slug breath if he is knocked out.</p>
