<h2><span class="mw-headline">Wikipedia:Peer review/Down syndrome</span></h2>
<p>Thanks for your extensive comments about the <a href="../../../d/o/w/Down_syndrome.html" title="Down syndrome">Down syndrome</a> article in <a href="../../../p/e/e/Wikipedia%7EPeer_review_Down_syndrome_0339.html" title="Wikipedia:Peer review/Down syndrome">Wikipedia:Peer review/Down syndrome</a>. I have copied all your comments over to <a href="../../../d/o/w/Talk%7EDown_syndrome_bfcb.html" title="Talk:Down syndrome">Talk:Down syndrome</a>, and we are starting to work on them. If I run into questions, I hope it won't be too much of a bother to ask you. Thanks again for the comments. <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedE_dbe1.html" title="User:TedE">Ted</a> 19:40, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I wanted to come back and thank you again for your peer review of <a href="../../../d/o/w/Down_syndrome.html" title="Down syndrome">Down syndrome</a>. Your comments were very useful and a new editor and I have made the changes you suggested. At the same time, another article I sometimes work on, <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_selection.html" title="Natural selection">Natural selection</a>, had been self-nominated for Good Article. That process was essentially worthless. Although it was successful, it didn't help to improve the article in any way (the only comment was left unanswered and it succeeded anyway). It pointed out how lucky we were that you took interest in our article.</p>
<p>I know you spent some time working up the templates for your various comments and I appreciate the effort, as well as for reading Down syndrome and helping to improve it. Thanks, again. <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedE_dbe1.html" title="User:TedE">Ted</a> 14:39, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

I've fixed and improved this article step by step. There is one thing I don't understand at all -- image licenses. You've said:</p>

<p>There are some album covers tagged as {{Albumcover}}, Therion logo is tagged as {{logo}}. In my opinion there are proper tags. But there are some photos tagged as {{promophoto}} and I'm not quite sure about these licenses. Should I get permission from Therion official website, source of these photos? <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisor_da42.html" title="User:Visor">Visor</a> 18:43, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Tnx. Some comments off <a href="../../../p/o/l/Talk%7EPolish-Soviet_War_9155.html" title="Talk:Polish-Soviet War">Talk:Polish-Soviet_War</a>: 1) 'This article may be a bit list-weighty' - there are no lists in the article, other then the references/further reading/elinks. Perhaps those should be eliminated from the bot checklist? 2) 'There are a few occurrences of weasel words...' - can the bot list all suspected references?.

<dd>The lists thing was triggered by the section name "List of battles"; I've been trying to thing of a way to get the javascript to search for bullets but there are External links and References sections that would have bullets. As for the other problem, I think I’ve just thought of a way to list specifically the weasel words that triggered it; I’ll work on it asap.

<p>Hi. A couple suggestions:</p>
<ol>
<li>It might be better if the text were shortened. This could be done by including a link to further info, instead of including it in every listing. For instance, the first bullet could look something like this:
<ul>
<li>[[User:AndyZ/jsprogram|Auto-generated suggestions]]: (These &lt;font color="red"&gt;may or may not be accurate&lt;/font&gt;.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Instead of "This article has little/no images" it should probably say "This article has few or no images. (You don't care if the images are little, just if there are few of them.)</li>
<li>Instead of "a no-break space", I think you mean "a non-breaking space".</li>
</ol>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Peer review suggestions for d-TGA article...more input please?</span></h2>
<p>Hi there, I am now working on your suggestion to shorten the ToC. To do this, I figured the "Treatment" section was both adding the most length (to both the article and the ToC), and is the most logical section to move to a new article (because of the extensive detail it goes into). In trying to come up with a title for the new article, I thought "Treatment of dextro-transposition of the great arteries" was simplest, though perhaps slightly ambiguous, so I thought maybe "Medical treatment of dextro-transposition of the great arteries" might be more appropriate...any suggestions? Also, if using acronyms in sub-article titles is alright it could be "Medical treatment of d-TGA"...your input on this would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Another point I would like some feedback on is if it's alright to use the exact wording from the lead of a section in both the main article and the sub-article (in this case, the text immediately following the "Treatment" heading, and the text immediately following the "Palliative" and "Corrective" sub headings - actually the "Corrective" sub-heading doesn't have any introductory text, but I'm thinking it should&#160;:D).</p>
<p>Last thing (this time&#160;:D) is if you have any suggestions on how to find someone to copyedit. I looked at the article you suggested for learning how to copyedit and did the exercises, and I found that these are things that I tend to do while I am writing anyway...the thing is, I wrote the bulk of this article (and have been copyediting additions by others as they occur), so I think it would be good to have a completely fresh set of eyes to look it over. In particular, I think it would be good to have it read over by someone unfamiliar with the subject, so they can give feedback on whether it is easy to understand, or point out any areas that do not explain the topic well enough. That's all for now, thanks for your help! <a href="../../../b/c/a/User%7EBcatt_84c6.html" title="User:Bcatt">bcatt</a> 19:33, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Andy, excellent script you have there. Would it be ok if I use it for generally testing the quality of my articles? And if so, how would I use it? Would you care to give a little help there please? <span style="color:#B03060;"><i><a href="../../../w/i/m/User%7EWimvandorst_0265.html" title="User:Wimvandorst">Wim van Dorst</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/m/User_talk%7EWimvandorst_3f33.html" title="User talk:Wimvandorst">Talk</a>)</i></span> 19:34, 21 June 2006 (UTC).</p>

<p>Hi Andy, I'm using your script often now: Excellent. Just one question, even after trying to read the script: what does it actually test e.g. in km.test? It always shows the NBSP remark, but I can't find the fault. <span style="color:#B03060;"><i><a href="../../../w/i/m/User%7EWimvandorst_0265.html" title="User:Wimvandorst">Wim van Dorst</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/m/User_talk%7EWimvandorst_3f33.html" title="User talk:Wimvandorst">Talk</a>)</i></span> 00:01, 26 June 2006 (UTC).</p>
<p><code>javascript:if(km.test(theText) || mi.test(theText) || ft.test(theText) || yd.test(theText) || cm.test(theText) || nm.test(theText) || inch.test(theText) || dm.test(theText) || lb.test(theText) || ton.test(theText) || gram.test(theText) || mton.test(theText)){alert("yes")}</code></p>
<ul>
<li>The nbsp comment drove me crazy once also (along w/ the spelling of units) because they kept appearing when it was obvious there were no units; since then I think I've cleared up most of the problems. Chances are it is being thrown off by either "# in" or "# gram". If you type the above into your URL bar after you execute the peer review, it should give you an alert saying yes; from there you can slowly use elimination to determine which one is setting off the problem. (like slowly making it smaller to <code>javascript:if(km.test(theText) || mi.test(theText) || ft.test(theText)){alert("yes")}</code>. <i><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyZ_5810.html" title="User:AndyZ">Andy</a></i> <sub><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndyZ_665b.html" title="User talk:AndyZ">t</a></sub> 13:40, 26 June 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Peer review script</span></h2>
<p>Hi Andy,</p>
<p>Might I suggest you add your automated peer reviews to a separate page and then link to them from the peer review page. So an automated peer review of <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cars_%28film%29.html" title="Cars (film)">Cars (film)</a> would appear at Wikipedia:Peer review/Automated peer review#Cars (film)?</p>
<p>You could then link to the automated peer review and add any additional comments you have on the article or highlight any major flaws reported by the script.</p>
<p>For example, you could write:</p>
<p>"Please see an automated peer review of this article here. I also think the "References to previous Pixar movies" and "Trivia" section would be better served by a sub-article. <i><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyZ_5810.html" title="User:AndyZ">Andy</a></i> <sub><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndyZ_665b.html" title="User talk:AndyZ">t</a></sub>08:10, 26 June 2006 (UTC)"</p>
<p>Or where there are no personal comments just:</p>
<p>"Please see an automated peer review of this article here. <i><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyZ_5810.html" title="User:AndyZ">Andy</a></i> <sub><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndyZ_665b.html" title="User talk:AndyZ">t</a></sub>08:10, 26 June 2006 (UTC)"</p>
<p>This would help reduce the size of the peer review page (which is always a good thing). It would also allow people to more easily deduce which articles have not been extensively reviewed by a human editor. I try to review articles with less reviews and with your script I find it more difficult to deduce which ones those are. Please consider this proposal thoughtfully.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<li>Oddly enough, I was thinking about something like that before you mentioned it to me; I considered moving the peer reviews to the talk pages of the articles to save space on <a href="../../../p/r/_/WP%7EPR_690c.html" title="WP:PR">WP:PR</a> and give human editors more room. I like your idea a lot better, but creating such a subpage whould require a ton of maintenance (removing archived peer reviews, adding new nominations, etc.). I'll think about it. <i><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyZ_5810.html" title="User:AndyZ">Andy</a></i> <sub><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndyZ_665b.html" title="User talk:AndyZ">t</a></sub> 13:47, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>New page looks great. I really think it helps keep the peer review page tidy while keeping something that is ultimately very helpful (because a lot of pages have stylistic problems).
