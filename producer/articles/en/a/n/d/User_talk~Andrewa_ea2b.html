<dd>Sorry for the confusion. I was trying to invite all the Christian Wikipedians to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Christianity_f011.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Christianity">WikiProject Christianity</a> because it said to spread the word. This is considered spamming though, so it was removed from your page. If you care to join, the link above should work and you can help Wikipedia expand the Christian articles. See the page for complete details. Thank you for inquiring. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillMak050389_99a3.html" title="User:WillMak050389"><font color="#336699">Will</font></a><a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWillMak050389_3c7d.html" title="User talk:WillMak050389"><font color="red">Mak</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WillMak050389_060d.html" title="Special:Contributions/WillMak050389"><font color="gray">050389</font></a> 03:55, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would like to thank you so very much for your comments on my talk page about my "internal spamming". Though I realize (yeah, I'm American) I maybe should have not invited every Christian on Wikipedia and limited my invitations to those who have taken a large interest in Christian-related articles, I believe that the attack by others was too harsh. We Wikipedians that hold tight to our beliefs need to stick together and have the will power to ignore those that choose to attack us. I hope to be talking to you again, and thank you for your comments.<br />
I also would like to award you this well-deserved accolade. (I'm giving it to you here because I didn't know where you keep your awards.) --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillMak050389_99a3.html" title="User:WillMak050389"><font color="#336699">Will</font></a><a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWillMak050389_3c7d.html" title="User talk:WillMak050389"><font color="#660000">Mak</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WillMak050389_060d.html" title="Special:Contributions/WillMak050389"><font color="gray">050389</font></a> 16:53, 30 June 2006 (UTC)<br />

<p>I noticed that you have made a number of constructive contributions to <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_chimney.html" title="Solar chimney">Solar chimney</a> in the past. That article has been cut/pasted/reassembled/morphed/transmogrified into <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_updraft_tower.html" title="Solar updraft tower">Solar updraft tower</a>. I have been trying to put in an unbiased assesment of its strengths and weaknesses. The problem I am facing now is that the article has been totally revamped by an editor from Australia, most likely somebody who is on the payroll of <a href="../../../e/n/v/EnviroMission_1cd7.html" title="EnviroMission">EnviroMission</a>, and who has pretty much edited out anything that is even remotely critical of EnviroMission's POV. It now pretty much reads like a brochure of EnviroMission. For comparison you may want to have a look at my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Solar_updraft_tower&amp;oldid=62641474" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Solar_updraft_tower&amp;oldid=62641474" rel="nofollow">Revison as of 23:11, 7 July 2006</a> to see what is going on. Going back in the history of that article reveals that this kind of stuff has been going on before, and that you were one of the people who tried to counter it.<br />
I intend to revert it to a more unbiased POV once the guy is gone, but I would be very appreciative of any support I can get for that endeavour. Specifically I noticed that some time in the remote past you put in the following paragraph:</p>
<dl>
<dd>This principle has been proposed for power generation, using a large greenhouse at the base rather than relying on heating of the chimney itself. The main problem with this approach is the relatively small difference in temperature between the highest and lowest temperatures in the system. <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carnot%27s_theorem.html" title="Carnot's theorem">Carnot's theorem</a> greatly restricts the efficiency of conversion in these circumstances.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This paragraph is one of things that went by the wayside recently.

<p>Hi, thanks for doing the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Pale.html" title="Pale">Pale</a> move. Is there a reason why you didn't also move <a href="../../../p/a/l/Talk%7EPale_87f8.html" title="Talk:Pale">Talk:Pale</a> to <a href="../../../t/h/e/Talk%7EThe_Pale_efac.html" title="Talk:The Pale">Talk:The Pale</a>??--<a href="../../../s/r/l/User%7ESrleffler_03c1.html" title="User:Srleffler">Srleffler</a> 03:16, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It didn't seem necessary to me, or even a good idea. The various talk pages all have significant page histories. I didn't move <a href="../../../p/a/l/Talk%7EPale_%28jurisdiction%29_3181.html" title="Talk:Pale (jurisdiction)">Talk:Pale (jurisdiction)</a> either.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The significance of the history of a talk page is completely different to that of an article. With articles, we're primarily interested in complying with the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. With a talk page, we don't normally need the history for GFDL compliance, as the contents are already signed. What the history still gives us is an assurance that the signatures and timestamps are accurate.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Similarly, the contents of talk pages don't have the same significance as those of articles. The important thing with an article is the coherent final product. With a talk page it's more being able to follow the strings of discussion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I felt that it was more confusing to move the pages than to leave them as are. If you find the current setup confusing, my suggestion is just to add explanatory comments to the relevant talk pages. Of course, that isn't an option with an article. There's also less problem with putting pointers to relevant section of the other page, or even cut and paste moves. But looking at the existing contents of the tslk pages, I didn't feel these were necessary anyway. The aim should be, make what has happened obvious to future readers, so they don't need to reinvent the wheel. If a move would help with this, then it's worth the trouble.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Do you think the talk pages should be moved? Why? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 06:01, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It seemed less confusing to me to keep the talk pages with the articles they related to. Having the talk page from what is now <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Pale_d5c5.html" title="The Pale">The Pale</a> remain with the article at <a href="../../../p/a/l/Pale.html" title="Pale">Pale</a> (which was formerly (<a href="../../../p/a/l/Pale_%28jurisdiction%29.html" title="Pale (jurisdiction)">Pale (jurisdiction)</a>) just seems confusing. Instead, I archived the former talk page from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Pale_d5c5.html" title="The Pale">The Pale</a> at <a href="../../../t/h/e/Talk%7EThe_Pale_Archive_1_7346.html" title="Talk:The Pale/Archive 1">Talk:The Pale/Archive 1</a> and made appropriate links, so both articles end up with a mostly-fresh talk page, rather than a talk page full of discussion about a different article.--<a href="../../../s/r/l/User%7ESrleffler_03c1.html" title="User:Srleffler">Srleffler</a> 06:20, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmm, how odd -- apparently someone moved it and I moved it back. It seems (judging by conversation on the talk page) I was mistaken about it being properly capitalized as a title.

<p>The templates now work good. The templates were pointed to the disambig as were some 1200 other articles in Wikipedia. Luckily I have AWB rights, so I went through all but 900 and change of them and corrected the links so that the assumption is made. It might be a good idea to put a disambiguation tag on the page (but just a suggestion...)</p>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm a bit skeptical that the change you've made is correct in 900 cases. Better if in any doubt to have them point to the disambiguation page... which is already tagged as such.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you mean we should have a <i>disambiguation</i> tag on the unambiguously named <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Wisconsin_System_8ed6.html" title="University of Wisconsin System">University of Wisconsin System</a> or <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Wisconsin-Madison_a81d.html" title="University of Wisconsin-Madison">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a> articles, then I don't agree.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The <i>see also</i> tag at the top of one of them is IMO not very helpful, although not harmful enough that I'd remove it. The article itself should contain sufficient information and wikilinks to enable navigation, which is far better than a link that says <i>see also</i> but doesn't give any idea of <i>why</i> you should see also.

<p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>I have just been looking into the Pipe organ and surrounding articles, and I think that the article you created at <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organ_pipe.html" title="Organ pipe">Organ pipe</a> is almost redundant thanks to the great deal of work that has improved the <a href="../../../p/i/p/Pipe_organ.html" title="Pipe organ">Pipe organ</a> page, which seems to now supercede your article. How do you feel about merging Organ pipe back into Pipe organ? I feel that a more specific article should contain more specific information. I don't think this one does any more! Would you take a look and give me your opinion? I'd be interested to see what you think of the <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organ_stop.html" title="Organ stop">Organ stop</a> page, which isn't as good as it could be.</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>

<dd>I didn't intend to revert <b>any</b> of your edits and don't think I did. What I reverted was the deletion of content from the intro by another user. Your edit was a minor (and correct) revision of this minimal introduction; I didn't think it was applicable to the old intro. I actually went back to one of 'your' versions (remembering that we don't really own anything here).

<dd>Cool. I just removed the excess wikilinks; restored the specific meaning of "socialist" re: Zeidler (and stipulated that he was Milwaukee's mayor, for those who don't know the name); and put all the timeline entries into present tense, as is customary (some were present tense, some past).

<p>Part of the reason there was no opposition was that it was never mentioned at <a href="../../../p/w/_/WP%7EPW_f376.html" title="WP:PW">WP:PW</a>, is there a version of the deletion review for moved pages?

<dd>Disagree that the article should be moved back. A Wikiproject is just another colaboration tool. If other editors decide not to consult the Wikiproject and the Wikiproject members don't notice what is happening, the processes just go ahead without them. In hindsight I should have raised it at the Wikiproject, but that's done now.</dd>

<dd>Yes, there's a review mechanism, which is simply to list a reversal of the move on <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My suggestion is that you discuss it on the talk page first. Quick relistings often attract a certain amount of opposition unless there's a consensus of several editors established on the talk page first.</dd>
