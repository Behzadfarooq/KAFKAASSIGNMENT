<p>Albert Johnson Einstein was born in Trenton, New York in 1854. During his childhood Albert Einstein lived through a bombing raid on the town of his Birth in Germany during which his father died and his mother soon died of radiation sickness that was a result. he went to school in england at drexel and graduated with high honors. Afterwards, at just the age of 36 in 1967 he invented the theory of relativitey which explains why exactly an equation works. He died in the bombimg of Hiroshima while designing a new type of space craft for a mission to mars in 1987.</p>
<p>Few argue that the Cold War had a profound effect on Einstein's childhood because he spent most of it in Soviet Russia. During this time he studied nuclear weapons and began to design a spacecraft that would later be used as a submarine to explore the deep water trenches of the Pacific and Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>Einstein lead a profitable life, as the main founder of IBM and Disney. He will always be remembered as the man who invented deep dish pizza and who shot the sherif. Chuck Norris owes many of his skills to Einstein.</p>

<p>Wide Binary is a mainstream alternative to traditional binary, but with the added bonus of affording 7 choices, instead of the more traditional two.</p>
<p>Wide Binary bits are either 0, 1 (to maintain compatibility with traditional binary), plus the new options K, _, €, Denis and 'Flarflwe', which cannot be represented in a human-readable form.</p>
<p>The widebit, K, rose to popularity last year with news of its inclusion in the forthcoming Mac OS X 10.5 version of rm</p>
<p>Whilst the other wide pieces of binary have so-far failed to grab mainstream recognition, traces of Denis have been found in HTML pages online, and an RFC was put forward to develop a new bit-mapped display for PCs, to display Flarflwe with the use of circles.</p>

<p>First conceived of by a group of technology professionals from Asbury College it was brought to reality when Rich Bowen actually implemented the design. The concept is similar to <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redundant_array_of_independent_disks.html" title="Redundant array of independent disks">RAID</a> technology, only applied to <a href="../../../c/o/f/Coffee_maker.html" title="Coffee maker">coffee makers</a>.</p>
<p>The first <b>RAICM</b> was limited to only 6 coffee makers, but the experiment was successful and future RAICM's may include twice that number.</p>

<p>This is a classic example of a 1948 standard school desk. When last surveyed, in october 2004, it contained on its surface over 30 years' worth of graffiti and annotations. The large ink-stain in the supper right coner can be reliably dated to 1964, and to Hugh Bonsuera, who was infamous for using indelible inks. As can be noted, the inkwell itself has subsequently be stopped up (this was done in 1996 as a part of the Government-led drive towards illiteracy in schools, to ensure that the "working classes" simply claimed social benefits and dossed around the streets, in return for alwats voting the "right way" at elections, a proposal which foundered when it was realised that not educating them meant none of them knew what an election was or how to vote in one).</p>

<p>The Westview Safeway is employed by a colourful cast of characters, who are both full-time and part-time workers and vary in levels of cynicism and education. The break room is rather small in proportion to the number of people working there, and is lacking in a television with cable. Another quirk of this store is the fact that employees are expected to bring their own utensils to eat their lunches; if it was not for a few kind souls that spend an hours worth of pay on plastic forks, they would be forced to eat their meals with their bare hands. The store is notorious throughout the city because in October of 2004 a bear made its way into the back room of the store and was an adorable little cub. It was later shot and killed. It is interesting to note that within the last few months the music inside the store has changed from adult-contemporary to top 40/adult contemporary, a move that has been met with a mix of elation and skepticism. One time an employee stole the comfortable break room furniture. The deli food is of questionable qualit</p>

<p>The Suebee Stalker is the nickname given to the unknown man who writes anonymous messages in on the sixth floor of the south tower of Thomas Jefferson Hall, a dormitory at the University of Missouri-Rolla. The history of the Suebee Stalker is an interesting story and goes something like this.</p>
<p>When he was in high school, there was this fat kid named Michael Farris. In band class he was being teased and proclaimed, "Slap me silly and call me Susan!" So everyone started calling him Susan, and over time that evolved into "Suebee."</p>
<p>They called him Suebee for years, and after that got old, the Suebee Stalker began writing the word Suebee on the chalkboards: <a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:TypicalSuebeeStalkerMessage.jpg">Image:TypicalSuebeeStalkerMessage.jpg</a></p>
<p>Michael eventually started noticing his name all over the school and said, "Who's this guy writing Suebee all over the place? He seems like a Suebee Stalker or something."</p>
<p>The name seemed catchy, so the Suebee Stalker took it and made a mark for himself:</p>
<p><a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:MarkOfTheSuebeeStalker.jpg">Image:MarkOfTheSuebeeStalker.jpg</a></p>
<p>He also used this mark to take credit for other random anonymous messages he wrote. Michael honestly thought he was being stalked and got pretty paranoid. It took him forever to realize who it was, as they were pretty good friends. Once he figured out the Suebee Stalker's true identity, he thought it was hilarious, and started leaving Suebee Stalker messages as well.</p>
<p>His legacy lives on, as there are still traces of "Suebee" messages scattered across the high school. Now he attends college, and has carried the tradition there.</p>

<p>A Mugwin is a furry little ewok type character with a fondness for sausages. The plural for Mugwin is Mugwin. Mugwin sleep for twenty hours a day and have a life span of three hundred human years. Mugwin are solitary creatures and, if provoked, will come back and steal your biscuits and other foodstuffs in acts of passive-aggressive sabotage. Mugwin do not know the difference between psilocybin mushrooms and any other kind of food. Mugwin can see in the dark and has excellent hearing, being able to discern a Muse riff from over half a mile away. They don't like eggs. Mugwin invented beer, kebabs, and Courtney Cox. The musky smell of a mugwin has been proven to be irresistible to women and, as such, they have been hunted ruthlessly by Ralph Lauren. Thankfully, Ralph couldn't hit a barn with a blunderbuss at point blank range and at this time of writing the millionaire fashion magnate has only bagged two Mugwin successfully (and both of those were stupid Mugwin who wanted to score some free cologne.)</p>
<p>Mugwin are everywhere and growing in numbers. It is said that no city dweller is ever more than thirty feet away from a Mugwin at any one time.</p>

He led a very boring childhood - he did not participate in sports, he had no friends, he did not go to school as he was home schooled but his parents forgot to teach to him. Absolutely NOTHING happened in his life until the great year 2004, when his cousin Ollie married Anthony.

Although never invited to any social functions and gatherings, he mysteriously shows up and annoys everyone. He will often interject rather amusing conversations with his one or two liners that are not funny, inappropriate and quite frankly stupid. He will then follow such nonsense with his glazed stare that has been rumored to kill a baby racoon that was rummaging through a garbage can in search of food. It has been said that Paul (Anthony &amp; Ollie's Cousin The 90,000 Mile Benz Intruder) has taken the look known as akward second and turned it into the akward 5 minutes.</p>
<p>He is mostly hated by the Birdman, for Paul (Anthony &amp; Ollie's Cousin The 90,000 Mile Benz Intruder) had frequented the Birdman's house and made rather rude comments about the proximity of Birdman's to a factory. He engaged in sexual intercourse with Birdman and did not extend a reach a around to him. And worst of all, he played Sopranos Pinball without first taking off his clothes.</p>
<p>Another who is known to dislike Paul (Anthony &amp; Ollie's Cousin The 90,000 Mile Benz Intruder) is Don Assman of the Don Sheepdawg famiglia.

<p>Paul (Anthony &amp; Ollie's Cousin The 90,000 Mile Benz Intruder) now spends his days driving up and down Wabansia Avenue in his Mercedes Benz with 90,000 miles. When his car is being repaired, which is more often than not becuase it is so old and quite frankly a piece of junk, Paul will ride his bike up and down Wabansia at which times he is know as the Paul (Anthony &amp; Ollie's Cousin The Bike Intruder). At other desperate times he has resorted to renting a car in order to drive Wabansia Ave and is then known as Paul the X Mile Budget Rent A Car Intruder). (note insert the number of miles on the rental car for the X).</p>
<p>Paul (Anthony &amp; Ollie's Cousin The 90,000 Mile Benz Intruder) is also known to spend most of his time when not crusing Wabansia Ave in the hot tub with Zuch Dog the Room Lamp. It has been said that while in the hot tub with Zuch Dog the Room Lamp, Paul (Anthony &amp; Ollie's Cousin The 90,000 Mile Benz Intruder) thinks about the Birdman and Benzo Bentley Lorezno the 4 Door Whore having anal sex in a hot tub in Indiana, who are thinking about Paul (Anthony &amp; Ollie's Cousin The 90,000 Mile Benz Intruder) and Zuch DOg the Room Lamp having sex in their hot tub, while Ollie is making polish mistakes and rubbing velveeta cheese all over her body.</p>

He holds the world record in many categories including, under-water wrestling (a sport he created in his sleep), llama racing, and fetus abortion. He was the first person to perform an abortion using only his left fist. He was the charter member of the HUAC, famous for Communist hunting during the 1950's in the United States. He also just bought the United Nations.</p>
<p>Geoffrey also has a very long nose, much like Pinocchio.</p>

</pre>
<p>TO BEGIIN EXPLAINING WHAT IS CONVENT BOX MEANS TO BEGIN MENTIONING THE ANCIENT ISRAEL.BIBLE &amp; OTHER SOURCES SAY THAT WHEN MOSSES LEAD ISRAALETES TO FREEDOM FROM EGYPT THE GOD HIMSELF GAVE THEM THE RULES TO FOLLOW.THE CONVENT BOX CONSIST OF THIS RULES WRITEN IN A STONE PLATE which IS KEPT IN A BOX WITH STATUES OF TWO ANGLES.THIS WAS CONSIDERED TO BE THE SOLE OF ISRAEL.A MAN WITH SIN CAN NOT TOCH IT AS IT WAS GODS RULE AND ANYONE WHO TRIED WAS KILLED BY GOD.BUT LATER THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS CONVENT BOX FADED.BUT IT STILL HAD ITS OWN SIGNIFICANCE IN THE HISTORY OF ISRAEL.</p>
<p>BUT AFTER THE TIME OF THE JUDGES THIS WENT TO MANY HANDS &amp; EACH TIME IT RETURNED.AT THE TIME OF JESUS THIS WAS IN THE GREAT TEMPLE OF ISRAEL .BUT AFTER THE DISTRACTION OF JERUSHELAM THIS WS TAKEN AWAY ANE IS HIDDEN SINCE THIS VERY DAY.</p>
<p><br />
THREE MAIN GESSES ARE MADE OF WHAT HAPPEND TO IT</p>
<p>1)TO ISRAEL ITSELF</p>
<p>SOME BELIVE THAT IT IS STILLIN JERUSHALAM ITSELF BUT HIDDEN IN THE RUINS.</p>
<p>2)MAY HAVE BEEN DESTROYED</p>
<p>MANY BELIVE THAT THIS COULD HAVE BEEN DESTROYED BECAUSE IT WAS MADE OF SOLID GOLD.</p>
<p>3)IN ETIOPIA</p>
<p>ETIOPIANS GIVE A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE TO THIS BOX.THEY SAY THAT THE BOX IS WITH THEM.BUT THEY DOES NOT PERMIT ANY ONE OTHER THAN A CHOOSEN PRIEST TO ENTER INTO THE PLACE WHERE IT IS KEPT.IT IS KEPT AS A TREASURE IN A SMALL TEMPLE SOMEWHERE IN ETHIOPIA.</p>

<p>Basically he is the coolest person on earth. He wrote the sequal to the Bible, Jesus's Revenge when he was 11 years old. He married the Greek goddess Aphrodite when he was 15. He is currently holding the positions of Coolest person on earth, Best Person on Earth in the general category. He also runs the Best Webpage on earth, badmotel.bravehost.com. He won 32 gold medals in the 2011 Summer and Winter Olympics. Hellza Yeah.</p>
<p>Early Life-</p>
<p>He was born in a small city called NâĦÍßşťξ on the tenth moon of Jupiter. He was an outcast as he grew up because he was was cooler and smarter then all the other kids and all he ever wanted was acceptance while all the other kids ever wanted was for him to like them. Were they to realize what each other was thinking there would have been a joyous celebration and all would have a cake to remember the day they met the coolest kid in the universe.</p>
<p>Later Life-</p>
<p>When Max was 5 he discovered the cure for the common cold, and gave all the technology to god in exchange for a lolly pop. With no more research to do he went into the movie bussiness. He starred in, directed, and producted his first movie at 3 years of age. The movie, The Bible, was a huge hit and later had a book written after it and a sequal in book form also written by Max.</p>
<p>After Death -</p>
<p>Max McKinney died at the age of 302 in 3015. Directly after his death he climbed the stairway to heaven in record time finishing at an amazing -3:71. After he got to heaven he hung out with some of his homies for about three million years untill he got bored of eternal bliss and went to scope out Hell. He kicked the crap out of satin at a tété et tété game of halo and hence became the new devil. He quickly sold to himself so he could play the guitar better then anyone ever.</p>
<p>After After Death -</p>
<p>With his new skill at the guitar he went on tour with Queen and sold more albums then any other single man ever could ever. In the year 2793 he finally got tired of playing the guitar and lay himself once again to rest on April fourty-second.</p>

<p>To understand the concept of having a pig in the pocket, one must delve into the inner workings of just what a pig in the pocket is. A pigtail is a commonly used electrical device whereby lights and whatnot are plugged in. It's quite useful for an electrician to carry an abundant supply of pigtails on his person, and naturally the pockets are a prime locale to store them.</p>
<p>First coined in late 2003, the pig in the pocket phenomenon has gained massive momentum thanks to one spunky Welsh electrican who inundated local airwaves with his spirited infomercials demonstrating his PocketPig invention. While the PocketPig was a massive failure, his famous catchphrase "GOT A PIG IN THE POCKET?" inspired countless copycats and imitators.</p>
<p>As of mid-2005, the phrase has also taken on the double-meaning of transporting pork products on one's person.</p>

<p><i>Text of the article with the above title, a prime example of incomprehensible translation:</i></p>
<p>This if refer about one suppose British attempt to British government to propose peace agreement at Japan during febrary 1942,when theirs recent losses your possesions of Malaya and Singapur,also theirs treated to stopped the Japanese menace over your most important possesion, Australia.</p>
<p>At same time such secret diplomatic movement,also was to public knowledge,this provoqued one political confrontation between the most important rigth-wing movements in period,the "Tohokai" and the official movement in government,the Kodoha party.such figth was represent the most serious confrontation against official policies in overseas for part of one party in oposition in country.</p>
<p>The Falling of Singapur and Dutch Indies poses grave consequences at British Empire in Far East,along the loss of Prince of Wales and Repulse (Gross of "Z Force")and abandon of Malay,England receiving some extreme heavy blow in your Empire,and was putting in extreme danger at Australia.</p>
<p>British seeing the direct Japanese menace against Australian soil when by secret diplomatic channels during febrary 16,1942 secret peace proposes in separate with Japan. between the points England if formally compromised to reconoited the autority of Empire of Sunrise over northern China,also conducted to United States at analogue conditions at change of petitioned of return to British sovereing over Malaca and Singapur.</p>
<p>Such conversations was provoqued in Japan one decisive figth between the most important rigth-wing Cliques in country;was possibly were the last political thinking figth against movement in government service in period,before at Coral Sea,Midway andGuadalcanal military defeats.</p>
<p>The ultranationalists and opened fascists grouping Toho kai led by Nakano Seigo,(appareing poses some political influence in time,also poses certain Japanese Navy support) stayed anxious to approved such conversations with British for making stabilization policy of recent conquests in Southeast Asia,also feared prevent any more sacrifices of own people,presured to Civil Government for stopped the great ambition poses the Imperial State Major in ampled such conquest.in other hand stay the Imperial Way Faction, party were represent the militarists interests,led by proper own Prime Minster of Japan General Hideki Tojo,poses totally diffrent poitn of seeing over question.</p>

<p>Proper Own prime minister Tojo at final inclined for last opinion and rejected such mentioned peace proposes and guiving autorization at your ambitious strategists the political figth between mentioned leaders,continuing until june 1943,when Nakano Seigo conmmited suicide in October 27,1943.</p>
<p>When Japan rejected such peace proposes,loss the possibly unique oportunity to mantain in Southeast Asian under Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere Alliance,for long time,also reinforce your recent conquest and yor post in land probably United States,was reconoited "de facto",these new temporary "status quo"for sometimes,for less stayed reinforzed for realizing adequate counterofensive.</p>

<p>The Biblical God's full name is usually given as Ronald God, and he is usually characterized as being married to Thomas the Nun, an 80-year-old holy woman. Together they are said by some manuscripts to have one son, Zeke, but some scholars argue that Zeke God is intended as a symbolic character rather than a concrete personage.</p>

<p>Let's get one thing clear right now: this article is not a GUIDE on how to actually become a mall punk, that is, DO NOT FOLLOW THIS GUIDE AND BECOME A MALL PUNK. There are several reasons for this, the first being that mall punks are absolutely fucking lame. Second, if you actually follow a guide to become a certain image, especially the mall punk image, you are even lamer than Jeff. Besides, everyone knows that to be cool these days, you have to be scream-o. Third, like I said, this article is intended for entertainment purposes only; it has no educational value whatsoever.</p>
<p><br />
Tools of the Trade This section is devoted to the things you will need to have on your body before you head over to your local mall. Some of these items may be purchased at the mall once you arrive or at a drugstore that is on the way to the mall, but all items, with some exceptions, are crucial to the desired look.</p>
<p>Cranium Accessories 1) Stiff Hair Gel- I'm talking spiky and offensive! It's your duty as a mall punk to disgust and annoy fellow mall mates with your wild and crazy hairdo. Under no circumstances should you attend the mall without an ounce of gel in your hair. Other considerations for offensive hair are beeswax, pomade, glue, egg whites, semen, or bird shit. As long is it is large and in charge, the people will be whispering about how weird and dangerous you are. Isn't that the goal of being a mall punk anyway?</p>
<p>2) Colored Hair Spray- Colored hair spray is a great addition to your head wardrobe and adds life to your spiky hairdo. There are many brands of hair spray, but the most cost effective brand I found was Punky Colour. It was about three dollars and one can covered one head. This is one of the products you can find at your local drugstore. A good idea, if you have a buddy going out punking with you, is to buy two different colors and share the bottles. This way, you can intensify the offensiveness with two colors! Two shades are better than one, just make sure that they clash. Everybody in the mall knows that if you use complementary colors, you're just a tool of the man! Under no circumstances should you actually dye your hair. Your parents will be upset, and they won't drive you to the mall anymore. Don't piss off the person that has the ability to ground you. Besides, hair dye is much too permanent for the budding young mall punk who should jump from trend to trend like a little frog jumps from lily pad to lily pad.</p>
<p><br />
Torso Accessories This section allows for a little more originality than the last section. While every mall punk worth his or her salt absolutely has to have spiky, colored hair, they can use their imagination for the torso area.</p>
<p>1) Jacket- The jacket can be anything from a green Hess jacket (like my friend Aaron had) to a tan fishing jacket with lots of pockets to a sleeveless denim jacket. It really doesn't matter what the jacket is, unless of course it is leather. Leather jackets go against everything that the mall punk stands for: ANARCHY IN THE SHOPPING MALL! The important thing to remember about the jacket is what things you put ON the jacket. If you want to look lean and mean in your punk apparel, you must add patches. The patches can be homemade or actual band patches. Here's how to make your own: Directions for Patch Making Punkers (This is called DIY! An important part of your punk cred!) 1) Find an old pair of blue jeans. 2) Find an old pair of scissors. 3) Find an old permanent marker. 4) Take old scissors and cut old blue-jeans into patch sized tid-bits. 5) Use old permanent marker to write band names and draw band logos. 6) YOU JUST MADE YOUR FIRST PATCH! Now, that you've got patches, you have to put them on your desired jacket! The preferred method of patch placement is the use of safety pins (danger pins as they're called in the dark, mall punk underworld). Fuck that iron-on bullshit. Mall punks don't even own ironsÃ¢â‚Â¦their parents do.</p>
<p>3) Homemade or Dead Kennedy's T-Shirt - To tell you the truth, I haven't seen may mall punks with homemade t-shirts. I was the only asshole who did that lame shit. Can you guess what my shirt said? If you guessed, "The Man ÃƒÂ¡ The Legend ÃƒÂ¢," then you would be wrong but if you guessed, "PUNX NOT DEAD," then you would be correct! Anyhow, the real deal would be the Dead Kennedy's t-shirt. This is actually just a generalization for any t-shirt purchased at Hot Topic or from some sort of "punk rock" mail order catalogue. All with your parents money, of course.</p>
<p>4) Backpack - If you choose to wear a backpack, make sure it's missing a strap, the zippers do not work, and there is a huge hole in it somewhere. Don't worry, you'll keep it together with safety pins. You'll also want to write every band name you can think of in white-out, even if you don't like them. Don't forget to wear it at every show!</p>
<p>Lower Extremities Accessories 1) Pants Cut Into Shorts - Preferably Dickies, but any style of jeans or pants will suffice. Just remember to leave the strands hanging off. You're not going to be a capitalist tool and buy shorts from shorts makers. You're going to make your own shorts from pants makers. Stick a patch on there if you're feeling really "punk." Fight the system!</p>
<p>2) Studded Belt - Every self-respecting mall punk has one of these bad boys. Remember, one or two of the spikes must be missing to give it that authentic punk feel. This gives the impression that you didn't just buy this at a store in the mall, you've had this belt your whole life. If you did just buy this at a store in the mall, then take off a couple spikes to preserve your authenticity. Hot Topic sells these studded belts. Make sure to shop there at least once a week while telling all your friends how you wouldn't be caught dead within thirty feet of the place unless it was to smash it in a fit of RIGHTOUS ANARCHY!</p>
<p>3) Wallet Chain - The wallet chain not only functions as an attractive addition to your punk persona, but as a weapon as well. Whenever those "crazy rap kids" are making fun of your hairdo, you can whip this out, hit 'em, and run! Don't get caught or you could get strangled by your own weapon, you fucking pussy. Oh, and about that wallet attached to the chain. Make sure to write an anarchy sign on it with a Sharpie, or if it's black leather just carve that shit in it with a knife. It's even more punk that way. Store clerks will cringe in horror at how punk your money is (especially if you write anti-American slogans, like "This will be the death of you." on the bills).</p>
<p>4) Shoes - If you don't wear Vans, you're not a mall punk. Vans puts on the Warped Tour, and there's nothing more punk than that. You might be able to get by wearing some Converse All Stars, but people may mistake you for emo. FUCK THE SYSTEM!</p>
<p>CD's To Own Here's a list of bands you must claim to own at LEAST one album from. They are in no particular order. - NOFX - Rancid - Dead Kennedys - Operation Ivy - Any band on Fat Wreck Chords (namely No Use For A Name and Lagwagon) - Any band on Drive Thru Records, but especially Midtown and New Found Glory - Black Flag (to show you've got roots [this requires that you know who Henry Rollins is, you poser fuck]) - Green Day (Dookie or earlier) - Many, many compilations with at least 30 songs each (This will allow you to name drop and keep up with any conversation you start. This will let you hear at least one shitty song by every shitty band in existence.) - Any band on this year's Vans Warped Tour - Pennywise - A "Before You Were Punk" CD (but you must hate Vagrant records) - Screeching Weasel - Gutter "The Worst Band In Existence" Mouth</p>
<p><br />
How to Act Once You Get To the Mall Ok, now you have everything you need to be a mall punk. Here are some anecdotes (stories, for you dumb shits) from my days as a mall punk that may help you in figuring out what to do once you get to the mall.</p>
<p>First thing's first, you have to try your hardest to annoy everyone around you. You can accomplish this in several ways such as doing a pointless dance every few feet, sliding off the edge of those rectangular bench things that have plants in the middle, or saying "Good Morrow" to every passing person with your hands clasped in front of you like you're fucking punk rock Friar Tuck. Remember, this shit isn't silly, it's punk rock.</p>
<p>Here's an example of what not to do because under no circumstances are you to get kicked out of the mall. It was a special day in the mall when various small businesses were allowed to set up stands to sell items and give out free balloons. Of course we picked up some balloons to make our voices all high pitched because helium voices are totally punk rock. So there we are, holding our punk rock balloons and engaging in some pleasurable small talk, when our friend Hosein (not Saddam) throws a tooth pick at my balloon, popping it and making a loud noise. Inbred mall security showed up to kick us out because we were disturbing the other mall goers or some shit like that. Anyway, the point is, balloons are no longer punk rock because they get you kicked out of the mall.</p>
<p><br />
Radio is not punk, dude.</p>
<p>A great way to get a few laughs that aren't directed at your ridiculous outfit is to bring along some fake dog crap and lay it out at random store entrances. First they will be flabbergasted, then they will be disgusted, then they will see an asshole sitting nearby laughing and realized they've been duped by the forces of pure anarchy. FIGHT THE SYSTEM!</p>
<p><br />
THE END</p>
<p>Remember, these rules don't mean anything if you can't get a ride to the mall</p>

<p><b>The dog in the future</b></p>
<p>Dogs as we know them today are land animals but they are quickly turning in to beasts of the air, developing wings and their own means of flying,This is being practiced all across the world and a new breed of dog called Canis Aviensis which in English is called Birddog.These dogs have wings two sets to be precise, one set growing where the ears usualy are and another growing from their hips which holds their body in place while flying. The tail of these Birddogs have grown a paddle like lump which is used as a kind a kind of rudder to guide them threw the air. they have also been spotted nesting in big packs of other Birddogs which is has been kept from their primative times, like their ancestors the wolves.they usually take nest in Japanes maple trees because of their big leaves, which protect these flying dogs from weathering. these Japaness Maples probly provide shelter much like the kenells used by their unfortunate relatives.We have heard from FatherChristams that he has found these amazing beast of the air, and has started introducing a strain of Huskies to this breed of dog because of their ability to pull sledges and better for an arctic climate and of course magnificent blue eyes which shimmer in the frosty christmas sky.Also can be used as a torch to find your way around in the dark. We have had a recent qouate from Saint Nick himself "These beautiful creatures maybe taking the place of my raindeers apart from being more obident they are less dangerous and more streamline.I am breeding my new found friends with Huskies because of their neon blue eyes which will guide me through the snow." So it looks like it's good bye red noses, hello neon blue eyes.</p>

This now means that Nancy Drew has somehow managed to find Eternal Youth, which still hasn't been discovered. She has oftentimes been asked by Acme to catch the world renouned thief <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carmen_Sandiego_c911.html" title="Carmen Sandiego">Carmen Sandiego</a>, yet surprisingly she has denied every offer to help put Carmen Sandieigo into custody.

<p>An extremely rare form of seizure caused by extremes of temperature at the frontal lobe of the brain, often due to a lack of hair cover on the victims head. During an attack the victim suffers symptoms similar to that seen during an epileptic fit, but is likely to remain in a semi-conscious state until the seizure has ended.</p>
<p>Precursors to Acrobaldgenic seizures are often experienced as sharp pains throughout the frontal cranium, visual impairment and sensory disfunction.</p>
<p>Medical treatment can be given to directly combat the effects during and immediately after a seizure, however preventative measures are often prescribed to reduce the frequency and severity of attacks. These measures typically aim to reduce the changes in temperature within the frontal lobe by insulating the head.</p>

<p>Maxwell Darby, also known as the "Whispering Death" killed like fifty-billion Koreans in the Great War. Sadaam's chemicals made him freakishly large, enabling him to dual-wield chainsaws, which was his weapon of choice.</p>
<p>After killing Koreans for a decade, Maxwell invented the taco which is now enjoyed by people that aren't Mexican everywhere.</p>
<p>Don Quixote mistook Maxwell Darby for a windmill because of his size and chainsaw wielding arms, and was owned. Out to revenge, Don Quixote later mistook a windmill for Maxwell. It owned him as well.</p>
<p>Later in Maxwell Darby's life, he became the communist leader of Moldova, his motherland. There is where he invented the wheel and a tasty recipe for scalloped potatoes. He also released killer wallabies he trained to do his biddings to put the Moldolvans in the kitchen where they belonged.</p>
<p>In 2089, after the war with the alien robot master, Maxwell Darby died of massive robot diarrhea and Tuberculosis.</p>

<p><b>The Declaration of Independance</b> An explanation of why tweety is breaking away from the puddy tatt. All birds are created equally. God gave all birds certain rights. They have the right to live, the right to freedom, and the right to persue happiness. the govenments job is to protect those rights. If the government wont protect human rights, birds have the right amd the duty to overthrow the government so that it is protected. A government can only work if the birds agree to be governed. A list of wrongs committed by Big Bird against the cat. Big Bird wouldn't listen to the bird's complaints. Big Bird wouldn't allow the birds a voice in the government. The Big Bird sent troops in times of peace and made the birds feed and house the cats. The Big Bird made the birds pay a variety of taxes without their agreement to those taxes. The Big Bird made the prisoners go to Florida to be tried in court so they wouldn't get a fair trial. At the same time if a cat official got in trouble, he would get a trial in Florida getting him out of trouble. Big Bird cut off all trade to the cats. The Big Bird wouldn't allow cats to move west past their homeland. The Big Bird captured cat merchants at sea and forced them to fight against their own men. The birds are declaring they are free and independant animals. The cats are now free of Florida's rule. The cats are a new nation of states. They will fight for their freedom if need be.

<p>Amongst all fans of hardcore punk music, 1995 is considered a crucial year. 1995 brought a breath of fresh air to a scene choking on the dust of what was and hoping for a breeze of what could be. This new wind was THE ONE FUNK CREW. These bold pioneers realized that rebuilding the punk scene required a new foundation, a new sensation, a cure for what ailed everyone. The medicine prescribed for the dying beast: funk metal. Cutting guitar work with vibrating bass lines. With the soundtrack expanded, THE ONE FUNK CREW was able to barnstorm the workshop circuit at music festivals across the land. The message was simple: freak the sluts and mosh. This message took hold fast and within a few short years, THE ONE FUNK CREW had cleared the scene of mind numbing political pot luck dinners allowing the barrage of fireworks and bad language from the next pioneers, NINE SHOCKS TERROR.</p>

<p>Rew is the biggest hacker to ever surface in the internet community. He hacked the Pentagon and made most of the computers explode with a virus that killed people. Rew is the most feared name on the internet, when he enters a chatroom everyone leaves, just because they fear him that much. Rew went to Phrack magazine personally and kicked all of their asses in. Rew is also known for being the most attractive guy on the internet. Why a man with such good looks and amazing wit would waste his time being the world's most infamous computer hacker, no one knows.. He was quoted saying "It only takes me five minutes to hack anything, that's all, seriously". Rew was once seen on a security tape bitch slapping Steve Case and then shitting on his lawn.</p>
<p>Rew is also the owner of the popular website Volum3.net. The website is known to only be visited by the most elite hackers on the internet, which only use IRC because AIM is for noobs. They use IRC to hack into his website and get into an encrypted chatroom that you need to have super amazing hacking skills to even see. This chatroom is filled with hot bitches, from real life modeling agencies. Also Hillary Duff is known to visit there frequently, only to get cyber sex from Rew.</p>
<p>Rew has a barrel chest, that bullets bounce off of.</p>
<p>This one time, cops tried to bust into his house (not because of hacking because no one in the world can trace him, he is uncatchable). But it was for a routine neighborhood checkup. Well Rew through a tooth pick at one of the cops it and it exploded his head on impact. The other cop was a lady, so he took her out to dinner, grabbed one of her boobs (he had sex with her too) then ran out on the bill, which was really expensive.</p>
<p>Rew can throw a frisbee into the sun.</p>
<p>Rew once traveled to krypton and punched superman's mom in the overies.</p>
<p>Rew once guest started on "Family Matters". But it never aired because he ended up having sex with the girl who played "Laura" and the original actress for the role of "Hariet". Before they switched the actress and acted like no one ever knew. Oh and the reason they got a new person to play Hariet is because Rew killed the original one after having butt sex with her.</p>
<p>Rew doesn't get speeding tickets, in fact, he issues speeding tickets to police officers.</p>
<p>Rew did all of the voiceover work for The Land Before Time.</p>
<p>Rew once went head-to-head against Nitro on American Gladiators. While Nitro dominated in Power Ball and The Wall, Rew beat him in Hang Tough and ultimately won after an amazing performance in the Eliminator.</p>
<p>He's also a hottie.</p>

<p>The biggest problem facing AJHS is dinosaurs. They've made us all think that they're extinct so they can come back and crush our primative defenses with their big dinosaur hands. Some dusty old dinosaur diggers told me that dinosaurs have little dinosaur hands. They are wrong. The leading leading theory is that those dinosaur diggers are secret dinosaur agents who probably have little dinosaurs in their heads. This head dwelling dinosaur is know as the HEADDWELLOSAURUS. Auburn Junior High School needs to raise money to purchase a dinosaur proof shield. This shield would be made of pure awesomium (atomic number 1337). To get a large enough amount of this element, all science folks (and maybe a dusty dinosaur digger or two) need to focus on discovering it.</p>
<p>Auburn Junior High School has the largest number of cameras in its halls compared to other junior high schools in the area. There are 2 or 3 cameras at each end of every hall. BUT NONE IN THE MIDDLE! This is where the dinosaurs will probably make their entrance. They will have time to get a small dinosaur army INSIDE the school before anybody notices them. Many people have said that the reason for the cameras is not to watch for dinosaurs, but to make sure students are safe. Watching for dinosaurs would MAKE STUDENTS SAFE! When told, those people responded with no comment. They are probably victims of headdwellosaurus attacks and should not be taken seriously.</p>

<p>Category:Staff</p>
<p>Sometimes you have to wonder, who chose the PHS staff. Somehow, someway, PHS has managed to find every babbling, ignorant moron, and shove them into one fascist, discriminative cage called a school. The current idiot of a dictator, is none other than Dr. Watson. It is still unsure whether Watson is truly a qualified doctor, though it is commonly doubted, since someone with such an in depth lack of intelligence could be anything remotely to a doctor.</p>
<p>The school has an unreasonable amount of principals: 8. Yes, 8. 8 blabbering morons who spend their entire work day running around after kids who do not have their belts on or shirts tucked in to the point where they can not breathe properly anymore. They should be renamed 'cattle herders' instead of assistant principals, since technically that is what they are doing. They chase after the cattle of students, making sure that they wear their tags with their numbers on it, not unlike the nazis made the jews do during World War II.</p>
<p>Over and over, the PHS staff proves its incompetence. Whenever a student has a voice to be heard, or an opinion to share, they are told to "shut it and get to class." Somehow, the PHS staff has printed in their fragile little minds, that they are completely superior to the students they bitch at (must be that o so fancy 2 year college degree). Perhaps if the PHS staff actually heard out its student for a change instead of telling it to shut up, they may have received some valuable advice and wouldn't have had some dirty internet dictionary article written about them *ahem*.</p>

<p>No one really cares about all of this stuff so you might as well put something here that might actually get read. Like how the high school sucks, and how teachers who say they don't show favoritism are the biggest bull-crappers I've ever seen. The same goes for coaches.</p>
<p>The Ninth Grade Center, which is joined by Pearland Junior High South on the west side, opened in January 2003 to alleviate freshman overcrowding. The state of the art building features a 1,000 seat auditorium and security features. However, many of the students describe the school as a prison due to it's nearly isolated location 2 miles away from the main campus.</p>
<p>As of the 2005-2006 school year, Pearland High School boasts well over 4,000 students. And it smells like a dead horse.</p>

<p>Category:Clubs and asstivitites Pearland High School has numerous clubs and activities, most of which have been said to be poorly funded and poorly supported by the administration, who shuns these clubs in favor of Football. Some of the more notable clubs include the Spanish Club, the Spanish Honors Society, the French Club, the French Fry Honors Society, Fag Row, the Pearland theatrical department, and the Lesbian Society.</p>
<p>Pearland's band department, The Poop of Pearland, is among one of the least talented and most laughable in the entire State of Texas. Although greatly underrated by many, the Pride of Pearland has been one of the most competitive and decorated bands of the past 40 years. It's many accolades including reaching the American Dodgeball Association of America (ADAA) state marching contest sixteen times, it's latest being in 2004 and placing 3rd in the 5A state championship competition in 1993.</p>
<p>Pearland's athletic department is considered to be one of the best operated in the state, even though the coaches only care about varsity. It's state of the art football field, locally known as The Rig, home to the Pearland football and soccer teams and its state of the art, three court gym in the North Campus for basketball and volleyball is reveled by many. Pearland's other athletics include tennis, golf, ice hockey, and bowling, which no one gives a crap about because any moron with the good knowledge god bestowed on the common pudding knows how to roll a ball down a lane.</p>
<p>The school actually has an abundance of clubs, but so few advertise that it's a miracle they even exist.</p>

<p>Category:PHS Controversy</p>
<p>PHS has a series of controveries which has exploded exponentially over the past few years which have been the byprodct of teachers and students not seeing eye to eye with the administration. This includes the writing of the word penis in this article. As well as the word vagina. You see nothing is sacred in this good and majestic school. Someone has gone in and written penis and vagina in this arcticle. But I must say that they would not be met with such resistance if the administration were less of uber Nazis and such. However in some cases the Pearland High School administration is somewhat unfairly targeted and there is not enough empahsis on the administration of the Pearland Independent School District, which by many has been accurately described to be the most corrupt in recent memory. Mrs. Watson would like to apologize to the students for being so pretentious and for pretending to be a doctor.</p>
<p>The biggest (penis) controveries revolved around the dress code which was implemented in 2011. The dress code, which has been widely criticized from the start, has been penis well noted for being loosely enforced despite the stringent punishment laid out by the administration. Staff members whom penis were specifically hired for the enforcement of the dress code at the high school were first hired during the 2004-2005 school year by mein fuhrer Sonia Serrano. With Dr. Watson at the helm at PHS, Watson hired another dress code administrator, whom are dubbed "Dress Code Nazis" by students penis for their behavior (albeit slightly overexaggerated) and out of protest. The 2005-2006 school year saw the re-emergence of the picture identification card after a two year absence, however penis the temporary I.D. did not return. The $5 mandatory fee of replacing the picture I.D. or facing in school suspension (ISS) for not having it has struck an ire with many students.</p>
<p>Many students have voiced their displeasure about the school's administration, which also included the 2004 PHS Valedictorian lambasting the school and the district and a profanity-laiden speech. Those who knew about the event cited that, and not the time constraints from holding graduation at Reliant Stadium, as the reason why the 2005 Valedictorian speech was axed. In addition, in 2005 ten sophomores walked out in protest of the dress code. The protest, which already had reached school officials the day before, was quickly suppressed in the matter of minutes with the police and school official presence. It was considered to be one of the most embarassing and highly ridiculed event of rebellion in many of the students' tenures at PHS.</p>
<p>Teachers have not been left out of controversies either. The 2004-2005 school year saw the arrival of as many as 40 new teachers, most of them replacing the scores of teachers who left due to being unhappy with the fuhrer-ran administration. Teachers have also been frustrated by the administration's empahsis on the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS) test. The test, which takes away from emphasis on the Advanced Placement (AP) and the SAT tests especially in the honors courses, have struck a nerve with teachers and some students. The administration often defends itself by saying that students cannot graduate unless passing the TAKS test, a mesaure made Texas law by then Governor George W. Bush in 2000.</p>
<p>An 20 month period spanning 2004 and 2005 calendar year saw the eruption of four sex scandals, two of which made the news. Many are now beginning to question the hiring practices conducted by PHS and the school district since the latest was by far the worst. Many feel this only adds to the atrociousness that Pearland High School and the Pearland Independent School District is being ran.</p>
<p>Even principals have been involved in controversies. It has been now revealed in 2003 Dr. Diane Martin was forced into retirement by the administration, a move which struck an ire with many teachers and students. The overly popular Dr. Martin was replaced by the negatively accepted Fuhrer Serrano. Mein Fuhrer's tenure, described by many teachers and students, was among the most hellacious and disruptive. However, there was a minority of teachers that liked the fact that the crazy bitch's administration brought down the lawlessness that was rampant in 2002, including as many as 10-12 fights in a week. Serrano struck a nerve with many clubs, incluidng the Debate team, when she drove out the ever popular debate coach, Paul Peterson, for a more conservative, by the books teacher (who was later fired do to yet another sex scandal). The move has proven costly as Pearland continues to get slayed in debate competitions according to some accounts. Even Watson being named PHS principal for 2005-2006 recieved mixed reactions.</p>
<p>Security has been a major concern at PHS. Several bomb threats and death threats to certain members of the administration (the most imfamous being the threat against Furer Serrano in 2003) have marked the past few years, and in 2005, a broken window was believed to be the result of a shotgun blast, which was supported by the finding of shotgun shell casings. Ironically the staff almost shit a brick, even though it ended up just being a baseball. Oh yeah, and those "shotgun shells" were Skittles.</p>
<p>PHS students suffer from extreme bullying which is a major concern- Ok. STFU. If you're being bullied and you don't have the balls to go tell anyone, or stand up for yourself, then shut up. Odds are you're a whining idiot, and you need to just go sit on a island with a volleyball named Wilson.</p>

<p><a href="../../../c/e/n/Category%7ECensorship_7214.html" title="Category:Censorship">category:censorship</a> All district computers are censored by Websense filtering software based on the ISD's server. Many staff and students have issue with the software. The main complaint is the blocking of all internet email including Yahoo, Google and Hotmail. Because of this, staff members are forced to use district email inboxes that are monitored, and more importantly, severely limited in their size, while students are forced to use complicated services in order to send documents from home to school since removable disks (such as CDs and floppies) are banned due to virus concerns.</p>
<p>Another issue with Websense is its overzealous and often innacurate blocking. For example, researching ancient Asian may return 'alternate religion'. Many feel that it is too favored towards Judeo-Christian religions and that struck a nerve with followers of minor religions and other beliefs.</p>
<p>Several sites are blocked incorrectly. www.ytmnd.com is blocked under 'GPORN' , a websense keyword that filters pornagraphy and all related words, (yay porn) such as pr0n, pron, p0rn etc. While censoring pornagraphy at school is debatably neccesary, critics point out teachers and parents should be responsible and almost everyone agrees that Websense's keyword blocking hampers the use of the Internet.</p>
<p>The sad thing about Pearland is that it's actually a great little city, and the schools aren't too incredibly bad. Well, they were at first, but then our current administration came along and screwed everyone over. Sadly enough they still have their positions on the school board, which they're still doing crappy jobs of running, and that's mainly why everyone writes so much smack in these articles.</p>

<p>Category:The administration</p>
<p>Pearland High School has no administration, what they have is a building full of thoughtless robots making decisions that don't affect themselves. Decisions that in turn create a sort of "concentration camp" atmosphere, where there are no students, only government monies filling empty desks each day. What are the positive effects of a standardized dress code, well hummmmmm, i can't think of any, this may be attributed to the fact that there are no positive effects of a standardized dress code. Each and everyday the "administration" is slowly diminishing the personal aspect of the students, first it was the dress code then it was the i.d.s what is going to happen next are we going to have to wear veils over our faces, so not to show emotion. Now if you would like to put an end to this Dress Code, or any other unreasonable rules drop a line to the administration, no one person cannot change not even ten, but if enough people support it they will have no other choice. Take a Stand people.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Wikipedia%7EAnd_now_for_something_completely_different..._Bad_Jokes_and_Other_Deleted_Nonsense_3158.html" title="Edit section: From Racuni">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">From Racuni</span></h2>
<p>The Racuni are a space-faring extraterrestrial civilisation in the fictional 'Racworld' universe. They are one of 10 such alien civilisations that inhabit the worlds of the Haven solar system, which consists of three stars, 9 planets and various moons. The Racuni live on their homeworld, Raccoonia, the eighth planet from the centre, which is best suited for their existence. The Racuni are one of the more dominant species in the Haven system, using their drive for advancement to give the Racun military some of the most advanced warships on land, in the air and in space for when conflict arises. The number of Racuni living on Raccoonia is quite low compared to other homeworlds, as population control has been in effect for several centuries now to ensure the sustainability of the small planet's resources, limiting the population to just under three billion inhabitants. [edit]</p>
<p>Appearance</p>
<p>The Racuni are humanoid, having a bipedal mammalian skeleton, but are still distinctly raccoon-shaped, which explains their name. They have the brown-grey fur of raccoons, including the distinctive black mask and facial colourings, as well as large pointed ears common in many mammals. Though they walk like humans, the Racuni still have black-and-white ringed tails to help them balance. The humanoid shape was a direct result of parallel evolution on Raccoonia, despite the fact that their genetic structure and proteins are based on a triple helix molecule known as tri-nucleic acid.</p>
<p>Clothing has been used since the advent of the Racuni on Raccoonia 5,000 years ago, when the archeological cores suddenly reveal the occurrence of Racun bones, clothing, tools, huts and fireplaces. It hasn't changed much, as is the case with a lot of Racun cultural artefacts, and typical clothing will vary from overcoats, trousers and jumpers in the colder climates to tunics, habits and shirts in more tropical climates. Clothing isn't nearly as branded as human clothes are, mainly because of the pragmatic approach Racuni have as a species. [edit]</p>
<p>Homeworld: Raccoonia</p>
<p>The Racuni live on a small, prodiminantly blue planet orbiting the third, outermost star of the Haven trinary system. The planet is seventh from the centre of the system, and is approximately 10,000 kilometres across. It has five moons, which vary in size from 500km across to 6,000km across. The largest moon is heavy enough to have its own atmosphere, and is protected from radiation by its own magnetic field, allowing for life and colonisation. The existence of Raccoonian plantlife on the moon has raised many questions about how they got there, but the plants resulted in the moon being named Veridian for its green colour, as seen from Raccoonia. Racuni have since colonised the moon, and several cities exist on its surface, though the lower gravity means that extremely prolongued stay is not recommended.</p>
<p>Raccoonia is one of two planets in the Haven system that sport large planetary rings made from frozen ice, rocks and dust. The rings have existed for all of recorded history, and are expected to last several hundred thousand years before the majority of the debris falls to Raccoonia or is mopped up by the gravity of the moons.</p>
<p>The climate of Raccoonia is split into three cells, the central tropical region that follows the equator and two polar regions that surround the poles of the planet. Because of average low temperatures, the Racun concept of tropical is better described as being our idea of a mediterranean climate. The climate zones are divided at the ±50° latitudes, because anything north or south of the appropriate line will experience at least one day of darkness during that hemisphere's winter. Thanks to Raccoonia's large tilt, these lines are far closer to the equator than on Earth, resulting in high variations of temperature between summer and winter. As a result, Raccoonian summers are very hot and winters are very cold, though the planet's distance from the nearest sun means that summer is fairly warm and winter is extremely cold.</p>
<p>During the Cold War between the Racuni and the Taiidari, the planetwide weather monitoring network run by the Ministry of Science discovered a definite shift in Raccoonia's core temperature, predicting the occurrence of an ice age within the next century. Knowing the damage that it would cause, plans are already being developed to fight the ice age, including the burning of previously unused fossil fuels to heat up the atmosphere and keep the advancing snowline back. Many are uncertain as to the effectiveness of such schemes, and whether they'll result in heat waves after the ice age ends.</p>
<p>Raccoonia has four continents: Eternum, Magnesia, Aquamarina and Terra Fuega. Three are inhabited by the Racuni, with the fourth, Terra Fuega, too irradiated to live on. Each of the three continents has a capital city because each continent is a nation, named after its capital city in the Racun standard. Eternum is covered by the country of Edanna, Magnesia is the nation of Ironholm and Aquamarina is Terra Flora. The three nations are divided into regions based on local cultures, each having a representative Minister in the International Racun Parliament. The planet is governed as a whole because the Racuni chose to have a united front towards alien civilisations after First Contact with the Jerbils of the neighbouring planet Jerbillia. The three countries also agreed to the creation of an International group of Racuni who wouldn't be allied to any of the three and could represent Racun interests as a whole. Over the four hundred years since First Contact, power has slowly been passed from individual governments to the International Parliament and Prime Minister, following a plan laid out not long after First Contact by famous sociologist Jonas Hadron regarding the social evolution of the Racun race. [edit]</p>
<p>History</p>
<p>The Racuni have lived on Raccoonia for 5,000 years, and the last 3,500 has been recorded officially by the various governments as the Racuni have developed. The sudden appearance of Racun society at that one moment, which spans approximately 60 years of archeological history, has raised many questions about the origins of the Racuni on their homeworld. For some, this and other anomalies in the fossil records are proof of the creation of the world by some deity, but most Racuni nowadays believe in a phrase that has been passed down since that moment, which is "what is here, began there". This idea of colonisation from some other, original homeworld is not scientifically accepted, as there is nothing to explain how a space-faring civilisation that could travel between solar systems and find a new world to live on would suddenly degenerate on arrival into near-cavemen. The real explanation is close, and the clues to it are scattered across the Haven system in the form of shared ideas, similar languages and cultural concepts like that of "what is here, began there". What happened, and the history of subsequently lost in the sudden onset of a shared Dark Age, was referred to by those alive when it happened as "The Exodus".</p>
<p>The Exodus is the end of the Ten Races when they were a great and powerful Union, joining all Ten Races from their various homeworlds together under one banner of exploration and development. As the Union grew and expanded out between the stars using quantum jump drives, they encountered another civilisation that didn't want to join their cause. The Union felt threatened by this new faction, and attacked, quickly defeated by a mechanical virus that could destroy their technology as it infected their ships. This started a Great War that slowly defeated the Union as the faction, only known as the Great Enemy, conquered each world the Union had colonised and then continued on. By the end, only the small group of Homeworld systems were left, protected by the remains of the Union's once great fleet. As the Enemy attacked the Homeworlds, the Union unleashed its secret arsenal, desperately turning their own homeworlds into weapons in order to hold back the enemy. The entire time the War had been going on, the Union had also been using its advanced technology to create a Haven they could flee to, hidden on the other side of the charted galaxy inside a nebula. There, they accelerated the flow of time to create a solar system out of a pool of gases, tweaking the coalescing shapes to create the planets they would soon colonise. This is why the Haven system contains perfect planets for all Ten Races. When they had finished billions of years of work in what appeared on the outside to be only a few decades, the War was almost over. The Homeworlds were under attack, and the survivors fled through a Gateway built in the deepest, innermost System that connected the Union to Haven. As the Enemy's fleet defeated the last world, they advanced on the Gateway. In order to protect Haven, they closed the Gateway and produced a vast bubble of interference around the Haven system that would hide it and prevent anyone jumping ships in and out of it. The bubble is still there, 5,000 years after the Exodus, and the wall of it is called the Barrier by the Ten Races, because it prevents them leaving the system by faster than light means.</p>
<p>With only a few million survivors from each species, the remnants of the Ten Races settled on their respective worlds. After a few years, a spaceship failed totally as the hidden infection it contained overwhelmed its technology. The infection, caused by a tiny amount of the Great Enemy's technological virus, had already spread to almost all of the technology in the Haven system, and everything failed almost at once. The sudden loss of the technology they depended on forced the Ten Races into a long Dark Age that cut them off from each other and forced each species to rebuild itself.</p>
<p>The Racuni lost their first, new city in a fire during the riots caused by the loss of all their technology. The survivors fled and lived off the land around the lost city for one hundred years, until their population started to grow back and farming methods were redeveloped. Eventually, after five hundred years, the city of Edanna was founded far from the original, lost city. From there, Racun society expanded. Eventually, more core cities developed far from Edanna, creating their own subservient regions that had distinct cultural differences from the Racuni of Edanna. This growth continued outwards for several centuries until the rich and powerful King of Edanna started applying his power to his weaker neighbours. It wasn't long until all of the regions had given in to the cultural, military and economic might of Edanna and were united under its flag.</p>
<p>It was at the height of the Edannan Empire that the first detailed historical records were ordered, defining that first year as 0 CE (the common era for all Racuni), which was in fact 1,500 AE (After Exodus). The Racuni continued to expand northwards, advancing from the southern hemisphere to the northern hemisphere. Eventually, after more than a thousand years of official history, the corruption of Edanna hit its peak. Riots and rebellions occurred across the continent, fighting against the conservative and restrictive government applied to the poor Racun populace. The feudal system they had run on was failing, and the furthermost northern regions were in all-out rebellion about the control the Edannan Church had over the people. The King was forced to send his armies north to quell the resistance, who wanted the right to continue the advancement metallurgy and mining, research in which was outlawed by the Church.</p>

<p>"Hot Dogs and Incest" was on the menu at school today, for lunch. While I was travelling down the lunch line, candidly conversing with others, paying no attention to the situation at hand, I remembered what was for lunch. After thinking about it for a few seconds, I found that proposed lunch very awkward and ridiculously strange, because, well, the prospects of serving "Incest" for lunch was simply disturbing. As I neared the point where the Incest itself would be served, all of my horrors/fantasies/whatever other confused word could be substituted here, were realized and built upon. How is it that these lunchpeople served me solid, digestable Incest? I, to this day, cannot answer that question. Is it possible that I would ever request such a lunch again? The answer to this question is along the lines of... no. One reason I opted to ask for a helping of Incest was because of the fact that the Hot Dogs themselves were, as one could imagine in such a vile setting, outright disgusting and intolerable. The gooey, flexible sticks of processed pork and beef were horrifically unsettling, and also did not fall under the category of "Kosher" (or halal, depending on your monotheistic religion of choice). So I passed on the Hot Dogs and chose the Incest... This decision is one that I still do not feel regretful about, because, trust me. the Hot Dogs were really that bad. But this does not by any chance raise the normality of the Incest I was offered, because this Incest was by far the most awkward and baffling lunch ever created. Solidifying an abstract concept, such as the idea of incest, into an entrée, such as Incest, was, and still is, quite possibly the most amazing thing that I will/have ever see/seen. Because of these thoughts of awe-struck magnificence, with a slight tinge of sheer disgust and confusion, and the fact that a lunch of Hot Dogs and Incest sounds like the most hilarious lunch possible, I have taught myself to appreciate such a wonderous suggested meal. This appreciation is not because of the exquisite taste, delicate preparation, or aesthetic beauty of the meal itself; this appreciation sprouts from the entertainment value of the idea and the overall hilarity of the fact that this lunch was actually prepared and served seriously with no joke intended. So now, in retrospect, I can truly understand and welcome the significance of such an achievement in lunch preparation/attempted disgustment, because I have completely realized the value of the lunch we had today, in its innovation and comic effect. Hot Dogs and Incest for lunch, indeed.</p>

<p>I will tell you a story about a man. If I can. His name was Arthur. He lived in Jerusalem 1001 years before Christ with his wife, and his little children, five in fact, which he named 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.</p>
<p>1 was the oldest, it was a He. 1 liked to use watch television as he was an antisocial freak, and he dressed in his mom's dresses as he was, Arthur explained, a little confused at his age. 1 was what we nowadays call, a transvestite.</p>
<p>2 was a girl, a very smart one too. Unfortunately, she got crucified as she accidentally ended up ,after drinking too much whiskey, in the emperor of Macedonia's bed. Well, that wasn't really so bad, he enjoyed her very much until she vomited all over him and blamed him for raping her in front of the media, causing a hysterical time in the newspapers.</p>
<p>3 was his mother's favourite. He was 19 years old. He killed his father as Arthur walked in on him and his wife, and buried Arthur's body in Egypt. (He carried the body within a spaceship with he had created) He and his mother got married, and later on a crazy writer called Homeros wrote a story about them, naming 3 Oidipus instead. 3 didn't like the name, it reminded him too much about octopus, which he hates.</p>
<p>4 was a shy little girl, which they sold for sexual services. She is nowadays referred as Batwoman, and is forced to wear a silly costume every time she has a customer.</p>
<p>etc was a good little boy, which accidentally created the U.S goverment by a mistake in the kitchen. He was only trying to cook some rats when he mixed cooked rat with a jar of butter. Of course, it's unreapetable, as the U.S goverment sadly still exists. Etc lives in Greece, within a cave, and kills everyone who turns up outside the entrance. He dresses in an antique mosquito-net which he invited long time before the rest of the humanity invented the fire.</p>

<p>Then the Merina kings set out to unify their island. Merina at this time was early Iron Age, technologically -- iron tools, rice-farming, but no wheels, vehicles, writing or monumental architecture.</p>
<p>The first thing they got were muskets (traded for slaves), and some drill instructors; then a few missionaries.</p>
<p>Then during then 1840's, a trained engineer named Jean Laborde was shipwrecked on the island of Madagascar and through a series of weird turns of fortune, became chief artificer to the Malagasy queen, and was granted large tracts of land and unlimited (if unskilled) labor. He had some engineering background, but no helpers, tools or documents.</p>
<p>He set up a manufacturing and engineering center, with the help of 5 other Europeans, but no imported machinery beyond simple blacksmith's tools) and within a few years was producing:</p>
<p>Iron (cast and wrought). Steel (via the crucible method) Muskets Gunpowder Light cannon Metal-working lathes Watermills Window and blown glass. Machine-spun cotton, spinning machinery, and power looms.</p>
<p>He set out to build a complete industrial complex, and did.</p>
<p>Within 6 years, and starting with a society whose idea of high-tech was a spear blade or hoe, he had blast furnaces with waterwheel-powered draught turning out cast iron, puddling mills to make wrought iron, a steeling plant to produce spring-steel, a glassworks, brickworks and cement-plant, a heavy foundry capable of turning out 24-pounder cannon, a musket factory, a gunpowder mill, and a tower to make lead shot.</p>
<p>Plus textile mills and a set of primitive, but useable, machine-tools. (Lathes and boring machines, mostly.)</p>
<p>He also built a 4-story palace covered with mirrors, and opened up mines and roads in various parts of the island, complete with bridges, and built ox and horse-wagons and a short (horse-drawn) stretch of railway.</p>
<p>By the time the king supporting him died, he had 15,000 men working for him in his little miniature Birmingham. The products they were turning out weren't as good as European manufactures, or as cheap, but they worked.</p>

<p><b>Bdugan</b> is a term used to describe a certain hand movement that is often used in dancing or in party games. It was invented at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_New_South_Wales_02d5.html" title="University of New South Wales">University of New South Wales</a>' residential college <i>New College</i> in the Suburb <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kensington.html" title="Kensington">Kensington</a>, which is in the east of the city of <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney%2C_Australia_bedd.html" title="Sydney, Australia">Sydney, Australia</a>. It has since become a very popular move amongst young males at the university, and has achieved somewhat legendary status in some Sydney nightclubs, who's bar staff instantly know if a patron comes from a UNSW college simply by witnessing the performance of this single dance move.</p>
<p>The move consists of holding both hands close to the body, then pushing them forward in a violent manner with one hand over the other, wrists touching and the palms facing forward, and yelling 'Bduuuugan' at the same time. It was originally the third move in a party game "sa-boonsa", which is a rhythm based game of elimination. However, it was adapted and It works well in a dancing context as en emphasis move for important beats in the music.</p>
<p>The cry that goes with the move was named after notable New College resident Ben Dugan, who was a well known figure throughout the University due to his involvement in many political and social activities on campus. It is not known if the move was named after him in jest, ridicule or honour, but it is wideley accepted that he is the person for whom the move was named.</p>
<p>The origin of the physical move itself is not clear. Many have compared it to the fireball move performed by several characters from the famous arcade game <i><a href="../../../s/t/r/Street_Fighter_II_60e4.html" title="Street Fighter II">Street Fighter II</a></i>. In the game, characters make the same movement as the <i>Bdugan</i> and yell "<a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadoken.html" title="Hadoken">Hadoken</a>" as a fireball shoots out of their hands. The similar movement and sound do support this theory, but it is not proven. Some older UNSW and New College alumni claim to remember the move being performed years before the <i>Street Fighter II</i> game existed, but those that claim it were not actually at UNSW at the time.</p>

<p>Tha Dizzytron is a man, or a myth, depending on who you ask who is showing up more and more frequently in the form of graffiti in his local area. He is believed to come from the far south coast of NSW, Australia although this cannot be confirmed because sightings of this wondrous being are scarce. His name can be seen scribed from the small town of Bermagui all the way up to Sydney. His favourite locations seem to be schools, parks, vending machines, toilets, buses and old women.</p>
<p>The police have had Tha Dizzytron on their most wanted list for the past seven and a half months, but they too are unable to capture him. He is believed to be very popular with the ladies and is an excellent lover. He may or may not be some way involved with another figure shrouded with mystery-Nesto. The two names can often be found near one another, but the authorities are unsure if the two work together, are the same person or it is merely a coincidence. The hunt for Tha Dizzytron has increased in the past few weeks with the school where his name can be frequently found, Narooma High School, cracking down in an attempt to find him and stop his work for good. Teachers and police alike are urging anyone in the community with any details about his appearance, place of residence or any other information to come forward immediately.</p>
<p>However, it is believed that he has a strong network around him making him basically untouchable. The women to which he has pleasured in his lifetime is thought to be in the hundreds, although the number is said to be too great for a definite figure to be confirmed. This infamous and overpowerfully attractive individual is causing heartache wherever he goes. Be it for the ladies he loves and leaves, there mother who have to put up with their daughters complaining no other man will make them scream like Tha Dizzytron did, or the police he mocks. It is strongly advised that when there is word that he is in your local area, that mothers lock up their daughters and husbands lock up their wives coz he'll fuck them too.</p>
<p>He is said to be armed with a loaded love post, a book of empty promises and a heartful of tears. It is highly recommended that he is not approached if seen for risk of instant obsession once the two of you lock eyes. Women aren't the only ones whose heart has been broken by this love-making machine, men to have succumbed to his charms...believe me, I'm speaking from experience. I left my wife and three kids for that man, only to have him tell me "trying to restrict all my love to one person is like pissin' into the wind. You'll always end up wet and regretting your choice when I leave."</p>
<p>So for the last time I implore to you, if you know anything at all about this 10 inch love hurricane, please contact the authorities, or even better me. I just want to experience the pleasure factory for myself. Thank you for your time. Good night and God bless.</p>

<p>Engin Taşdemir is the faunding father of the movement mundarism.This movement depents on wasting all the values of humanbeings and worldy activities.According to Engin Tasdemir; a person who devotes himself/herself to waste these values reach the real function of his/her extinct.He claims that one day everybody will be gethered under the perfect soil of mundarism. He is from Samsun and lives in İzmir.That is,Samsun is the birth place of this movement.All mundarists assume that it is a divine place because Engin Tasdemir who use the idiom 'aklımdan da gecmedi degil' born here with the values of mundarism.On the other hand he is the only person who uses his snore as a weapon against the empitiness of all existing actions.The cornerstones of his movement are based on the thought F.Club was an invigorating postmodern exploration of society and men. It was directed with amazing visual flair by David Fincher. Fincher also extracted amazing performances from both Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. Helena Bonham Carter completely erases the notion of her as a corset-clad maiden. The story line was non-linear, but not hard to follow at all. The movie starts in one direction, but ends up in a completely different realm. This change in direction is not illogical, as some people see it. Mass disillusionment and insanity is what leads us to the unusual direction the movie takes. The men are easily led into the mind-set of another. Insanity is contagious in a downtrodden society. In the end, this movie is not just another action-flick, but a sharp dissection of modern disenchantment and its possible effects on the public. So what makes mundarism excellent is that imaginary background.</p>

<p>Note: Some networks are moving towards replacing the hub with a switch to improve the handling of the network traffic.</p>
<p>A current trend is to remove the hub/switch/router altogher. This new technology is known as a stand-alone computer.</p>
<p>Standalone networks really are the best thing since Sliced Bread. I run standalone networks throughout my house, and never have any problems with viruses, they're that reliable!</p>

<p>To connect your stand-alone network to another network of any type, whilst preserving it's stand-alone nature, a firewall must be placed between the hub and the second network. This firewall's rules must be set to "Block all traffic". Indeed, the advantage of the stand-alone network in this instance is if the network fails, your browsing experience does not suffer.</p>

<p>population: 4 or 16 on a good day. Old Rectoryland is an independant country, surrounded on all sides by England. The current Monarch is King Christopher I. The Royal Family has ruled over the country and colonys for over three months. The largest colony in her empire is Edlingtonhal, the governor of which is Men Sir McQuade, Men being the equivalent of General. The Army is made up of several parts, The two large divisions being the Edlingtonhal Corps and the Rectorian Guards.</p>
<p>Chief imports: paper, food, computer parts. Chief exports: Printed sheet music.</p>
<p>The country pays England to provide healthcare, water, electricity, and when required the aid of International Peace-keeping Forces (Lincolnshire Police). Most legal matters are dealt with by the citizens of the country, but on rare occasions of severe difficulty, a Judicial Marshal may be elected.</p>
<p>The country has its own alphabet, to be used on some official documents, but the language itself is seldom used, consisting as it does of only two words.</p>
<p>Moorby English-Rectorian Dictionary who: whom (wom) you/it/he/she/that/them/they/is it/is he/is she/is that/are they/ are you: Bhat (bat)</p>
<p>Bhat:you/it/he/she/that/them/they/is it/is he/is she/is that/are they/ are you whom:who</p>
<p>Most matters concerning the country's independance are dealt with by The Prince of Vejgaarden, and he would like it to be known that this is not malicous nonsense it is in fact ALL TRUE. recognition is in the process of being given from the british government.</p>

My background research indicates that you are one of the more influential gay editors of Wikipedia.

<dd><i>This troll apparently tried "everything is cute and fuzzy if you change random words and liken the subject to chefs and cookie-munchin' French dolls" approach.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The significance of Safer Sephiroth's form to <i>Final Fantasy VII</i>'s story is difficult to deduce and open to interpretation because, like many unusual final boss forms, its nature is never explained, or even discussed, in the game. Some believe that this form of Sephiroth is the closest he ever comes to reaching his goal of becoming a chef by absorbing the Lifestream. Others believe that this form is a result of Sephiroth's giving in to his Jenova heritage, and speculate that it may give a hint to the true form of Jenova's race: if a human with Jenova genes appears as a bizarre winged creature, is Jenova's race a race of 17th century French Dolls?</p>
<p>From a symbolic perspective, Sephiroth's spacy nature, combined with his obsession with becoming the world's greatest chef, could be viewed as a reference to Sephiroth's role as a "cookie addict" - like Milton's <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satan.html" title="Satan">Satan</a>, Sephiroth is a once-majestic being that fell from grace and became twisted and evil. Also, his mother (or rather who he believed to be his mother) is Jenova, whose name is a variant of <a href="../../../j/e/h/Jehovah.html" title="Jehovah">Jehovah</a>, which is an adapted version of the <a href="../../../t/e/t/Tetragrammaton.html" title="Tetragrammaton">Tetragrammaton</a>, the name of God, and <a href="../../../n/o/v/Nova.html" title="Nova">Nova</a>. Also, Sephiroth's (or rather his clones') traversing the world as a "man in a black cape", can be interpreted as a parallel to bards, as a popular image of him, specifically in the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Ages_99b9.html" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, was as a man in a black cape travelling the world, leaving despair and destruction in his wake.</p>

<p>Throughout the reign of the family many things have changed. During the reign of King Roadrunner I there wasn't a institution or anything, only a small paper crown.</p>
<p>This all changed with the reign of Queen Tiny III whom introduced the Church Royal, a new church filled with luxurious drapes, flags, boxes, carpets, books and a new crown.</p>
<p>As the different monarchs succeeded the Church was improved and then the Parlour of Rest was introduced and added to the church upon the reigh of Queen Tiny IV, here the coffin of the deceased monarch lies in state for 3 days.</p>
<p>Then major changes came during the reign's of Roadrunner III &amp; IV, a new gold crown was purchased from london in November 2004 replacing the old crown, the old crown was refurbished and now used as a personal princely crown and then again a new total Gold red silk crown was bought in July 2004 from London, replacing the previous November crown and is still used today.</p>
<p>All of the old crowns are kept in the Parlour of Rest whilst the Princely and Sovereign crowns are kept in the Royal Church.</p>
<p>In 2004 upon the reign Queen Tiny IV Church Royal was abolished and replaced by the new <i>Royal House</i> which is now used today and which all Royalty are apart of.</p>

<p>The <i>Governer</i> of the government is to be elected once per 6 months and only ONE set of laws are alowed to be passed during the rule, althouh the monarch now has to negotiate all laws passed with the Governer first and is NOT allowed to abolish institutions or create without Government approval.</p>
<p>The constitutuion is as follows:</p>
<p><i>'For the Hamsters, God and the Law shall the Hamsteria Government be formed, with the KING and the GOVERNOR sharing equal right of power of law'</i></p>
<p>This act was created and in a ceremony of the Royal Family the new 'Seat of Power' building opened by King Roadrunner IV, whom is the first Governer of the constitutional monarchy.</p>
<p>The lost of Governors is as followed:</p>

<p><b>Lee Maisey</b> smoked more than 25,000 <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marijuana.html" title="Marijuana">reefers</a> during his 11-year use of the drug. The night before his death, in <a href="../../../j/a/n/January.html" title="January">January</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, Maisey had complained of a headache and the next morning he was found dead. The coroner's report revealed Mr. Maisey was free from disease and had not had a drink of alcohol for at least 48 hours before his death. Post-mortem tests also revealed a high level of cannabinoids in Mr Maisey's blood. The coroner's report stated "Death due to probable cannabis toxicity". This finding was found on multiple professional reviews to be "not legitimate".</p>

<p>Despite it's reasonable size, there would appear to be only three families living in the town, and this would go some way to explaining the average intelligence of the towns inhabitants, centuries of inbreeding will eventually start to take toll on the gene pool, and this is certainly the case in Bedworth, where the average person is an unemployed, unskilled father of seven, who once had sex with his Aunty, and who now sleeps on his brothers couch because when he is alone he wets the bed.</p>
<p>The majority of the town centre was built in the post-war period, and has all the hallmarks of such a development, concrete, concrete, concrete. The town centre itself contains some of the usual high street names, Tesco, Iceland, and Kwik-save are all represented here. However, possibly due to the large elderly population of the town, there is a vast number of Charity shops, and card shops.</p>
<p>The locally born author <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Eliot_fae2.html" title="George Eliot">George Eliot</a> (Mary Anne Evans) lived "Griff House" just north of Bedworth between <a href="../../../1/8/1/1819.html" title="1819">1819</a> and <a href="../../../1/8/4/1841.html" title="1841">1841</a>.

<li>Ensuring you are <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pregnant.html" title="Pregnant">pregnant</a> at least twice before your 20th Birthday</li>

<p>Branaw is Barney the dinosaur, in disguise. Branaw is the alter ego of Barney, and is a full time rapper. As of now the count is 13 times, in which Branaw has spent time in a maximum security penetentary. Currently, Branaw resides in Orlando, Florida, but makes frequent flights all across the world.</p>
<p>Branaw started making childrens videos after he was inspired by taking elementary education and interrior designing in jail. After several years of making a childrens show, as well as making books on tape, childrens books, and even starring in a broadway show, Branaw eventually cracked under all the pressure. Thus crushing all perception of reality.</p>
<p>After this ordeal Branaw had no direction in life. His only connections on the street were two record lable managers, Mike and Greg. Mike and Greg knew that Branaw was a diamond in the rough, and saw his potential. They took him in and began a twelve month trip to hell, which leaded to the creation of Branaws debut album: Killin Nigs in the 407.</p>
<p>The record and every song on it went to the top ten on the billboards. At the time Branaw was on top of the game. What Branaw didn't realize was that the rap game was for real. Drugs and tossing salad took over Branaws Life. Branaw didn't mind though, he had enough money to buy enough salad syrup for the rest of his life. Eventually, however, this led to disaster.</p>
<p>On May 19, 1999; Branaw shot nine opposing gang members at a show he was performing in. Branaw was sentenced to nine months in jail, with no parole.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sport.html" title="Sport">sport</a> of Nut Balancing was born on Tuesday 15th Novemeber 2005 in <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leeds.html" title="Leeds">Leeds</a>, <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_7642.html" title="UK">UK</a>. From its small beginnings the sport has taken off in pubs around the world, thanks mainly to the photo sharing website <a href="../../../f/l/i/Flickr.html" title="Flickr">flickr</a>.</p>
<p>To take part in a game of nut balancing you simply need some nuts and a flat surface. The sport can be played alone or against others. There is no upper limit to the number of participants.</p>
<p>You may use any type of <a href="../../../n/u/t/Nut.html" title="Nut">nut</a>, dry-roasted and <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salted.html" title="Salted">salted</a> <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peanuts.html" title="Peanuts">peanuts</a> being the most popular form, but <a href="../../../a/l/m/Almonds.html" title="Almonds">almonds</a> have also been seen. The nuts must be stacked one by one on top of each other. The current record is nine consecutive nuts before the stack tumbled, achieved 29 November 2005 by one of the sports co-founders Rick Harrison - aka SovietUK.</p>
<p>Record breakers are required to photograph their balancing act and share the evidence in flickr's www.flickr.com/groups/peanutbalancing/ Peanut Balancing group.</p>
<p>The sport also has its own fledgling website nutballs.blogspot.com/ here, where you can see updates on current records &amp; competions as well as a full summary of the sports <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rule" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:rule">rules</a>.</p>
<p>The founders of Nut Balancing say their invention was inspired by <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comedian.html" title="Comedian">comedian</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Gorman_59f2.html" title="Dave Gorman">Dave Gorman</a>'s hobby of rock balancing.</p>

<p>The breed is still bred and raised in Switzerland, where it is especially sought for its milk, used to make traditional <a href="../../../c/h/o/Chocolate.html" title="Chocolate">chocolate</a>. The breed is easily recognizable because of its body colours (white and a tint of violet), and as such has become the image of the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milka.html" title="Milka">Milka</a> brand of chocolate.</p>
<p>The name <i>Helvetica</i> proved a problem when a <a href="../../../t/y/p/Typeface.html" title="Typeface">typeface</a> designer registered <i><a href="../../../h/e/l/Helvetica.html" title="Helvetica">Helvetica</a></i> as a brand name. Litigation ensued for a number of years between the Swiss association of cow breeders and the type designer until a settlement was reached, which concluded that no abusive concurrence could ensue between cattle and printing fonts.</p>

<p>Scientists have been carrying out face transplants since the days of cavemen. The first successful face transplant was carried out by Dr. Ogg two hundred thousand years ago. His patient's face had been bitten by a Tyranosaurus Rex multiple times and was bleeding profusely before Ogg managed to quell the bleeding and attach skin from the patient's buttox to his cheeks, nose, and eyes. The patient died from lack of oxygen shortly after.</p>

<p>The Aborigine squirrel is like, this, uh, scruffy looking thing, that has, like, ten arms that can tear the limbs off a large bear or bear-shaped creature. It stands about uhh...this high (me making large sweeping gestures with hands), and casts a shadow that is actually in the shape of Marmaduke, the famous comic strip dog. It has orange fur and pointy, sharp teeth that would seriously hurt if they bit you. It makes small yelping noises if you touch it in any place except its general non-mentionable region (just below the belly button for those of you who don't already know what region I'm referring to). The Aborigine squirrel can speak twelve languages, including all of the dead ones. It can't yet speak German, but is learning. Come on, languages are hard to learn, don't make fun. The Aborigine squirrel is better than you, especially at juggling. His diet consists mostly of small seeds from the Summersweet tree of the Pacific Northwest region and the occassiaonl aformentioned bear or bear-shaped creature.</p>

<p>Template:SUV TIPPING</p>
<p>SUV tipping is a pastime allegedly common in urban areas, in which participants sneak up on upright parked SUVs and then push them over for amusement. Some variants of this urban legend state that the SUV is then unable to be driven. The appeal of this URBAN myth derives from the belief that owners of SUVs are slow-witted and top-heavy, and the corollary assumption that relatively little force would need to be applied to the top of such apparently precarious vehicle to tip them over.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays to the recurring theme of many urban legends relating to the United States of the owners being backwards and having simple games. There is no evidence aside from (mostly unreliable) eyewitness reports that any SUVs have ever been tipped in this manner. In addition, there are a number of problems with typical accounts of SUV tipping. Unlike CARS that do not tip over when they park,an SUV drivers sleep is very light and are easily disturbed like a typical of herd prey animals; many of them take only short naps at regular intervals throughout a 24 hour period, which means that at any given time, some members of the herd think they are aware and alert. The vision field from a SUV is larger than that of a car, and they have acute smell. Thus, SUVs are not easy to sneak up on. If startled, they quickly communicate to the rest of the herd that something is amiss. SUVs are large, and would be very difficult to tip. A grown SUV can be well over 6 feet high with a mass of on the order of several tons. By way of comparison, a typical SUV driver masses only 140 kg (310 lb).</p>
<p>Many variants of the legend claim that successfully tipping a SUV will result in the SUV's owner’s death. Although SUVs owners can die if prevented from sitting upright for an extended period of time, briefly forcing a SUV onto its back will not kill them. Under typical circumstances, a SUV driver knocked onto its back would not be not able to restore itself to an upright position. Other versions of the SUV tipping story attempt to evade these objections by claiming, for example, that although SUVs owners drive and dream, they can still doze while parking. Finally, attempting to tip a SUV is a patently dangerous activity. Despite the vehicles reputation for being placid and slow moving, a SUV driver is easily capable of hurting someone when provoked or nervous; a herd of SUVs or a truck (easily mistaken for a SUV in the dark) would be even more dangerous.</p>
<p>A TIPPER in southern California claims: "SUV tipping is possible, it is very simple and I've done it. It requires three people (note: be very quiet, but sobriety may be a hindrance), one person on one side of the SUV, two on the other. The lone person pushes very hard on his side, and waiting for the balancing response from the startled passengers, the other two then push very hard on their side to overbalance it.</p>

<p>Let us remember the Native Americans, the First People — those whose women we raped and whose land we ravaged. Those who we slaughtered, called savages, and killed nearly to extinction so we could take their land by force.</p>
<p>Let us remember the buffalo, that we shot out of boredom.</p>
<p>Let us remember the natural beauty of the land we have raped, industrialized, and transformed into asphalt sprawl and strip malls. This is the testament of the Whiteman, of our vision for the country we stole.</p>
<p>Let us remember the economy we built on the backs of slaves. We would not be the nation we are today without those centuries of a free labor force. Let us give thanks to the abuse and death which leads us all to the life we celebrate today. Go buy something. Support our economy in their honor.</p>
<p>And let us thank our women, who we still expect to take care of the children, the house, and the meals while working a full time job like the men. We expect the Thanksgiving meal to have all the fixings.</p>
<p>Let us thank the turkey we eat — what once was a majestic and wild bird, but is now a chemically altered fatbag that sometimes cannot stand on its own feet, collapsing under the manufactured weight. You will be delicious, abused bird, covered in gravy.</p>
<p>On the side, perhaps we can eat Bt-Corn in honor of the original maize — and maybe a serving of anti-hepatitis B GMO-potatos, mashed.</p>
<p>I like mixing those two sides items together, and covering them in gravy.</p>
<p>Maybe we can even get a pie made with a GMO Monster Pumpkin. You will be tasty, you chemically altered pumpkin treat, with a topping of whipped cream.</p>
<p>Oh glorious Earth, we are thankful that you accept our abuses of you and your children regularly. Forgive us, for we know not what we do.</p>

<p>The <i>Penis Muncher</i> anime and manga series introduces an original card game created by Takahashi. Different names can be used to refer to the game depending on where it appears:</p>
<ul>
<li><i><b>Magic &amp; Wizards</b></i> (<i><b>M&amp;W</b></i>) — the original name of the card game, used in the original <i>Penis Muncher</i> (Japanese and English versions) manga, and <i>Penis Muncher R</i>. In the case of the English manga, the game is renamed <i>Duel Monsters</i> in later-released chapters.</li>
<li><i><b>Duel Monsters</b></i> — used in Toei Animation's <i>Penis Muncher</i> anime, the second series <i>Penis Muncher</i> anime (Japanese and English versions), manga (English version only), and movies. The name is introduced to replace <i>Magic &amp; Wizards</i>, probably due to its similarity to <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Magic%7E_The_Gathering_240a.html" title="Magic: The Gathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></i>.</li>
<li><i><b>Penis Muncher Official Card Game: Duel Monsters</b></i> (<i><b>Penis Muncher OCG</b></i>) — the original name of the real <i>Penis Muncher</i> card game released by <a href="../../../k/o/n/Konami.html" title="Konami">Konami</a>, used mostly in Asia.</li>
<li><i><b>Penis Muncher Trading Card Game</b></i> (<i><b>Penis Muncher TCG</b></i>) — used in places where <a href="../../../u/p/p/Upper_Deck_Entertainment_6052.html" title="Upper Deck Entertainment">Upper Deck Entertainment</a> distributes <i>Penis Muncher OCG</i>.</li>

<p>Designed by Kazuki Takahashi, <i>Magic &amp; Wizards</i> (<i>M&amp;W</i>), is a popular card game worldwide. Compared with its predecessor, <i>M&amp;W</i> was very simple when it was first introduced in the manga: there were only two types of cards (<i>Monster</i> &amp; <i>Magic Cards</i>); the result of a monster battle only relied on the <i>Attack</i> and <i>Defense Points</i> of the monsters and the effects of Magic Cards (which only appeared occasionally). According to the author, the game was designed as such because he felt that the rules of <i>Magic</i> were too complicated, and he wanted to create something similar but simplier<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_simplier"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/n/d/Wikipedia%7EAnd_now_for_something_completely_different..._Bad_Jokes_and_Other_Deleted_Nonsense_3158.html#endnote_simplier" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/n/d/Wikipedia%7EAnd_now_for_something_completely_different..._Bad_Jokes_and_Other_Deleted_Nonsense_3158.html#endnote_simplier" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></sup></span>.</p>
<p>The original plan of Takahashi was to phase out <i>M&amp;W</i>, which took him only one night<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_night"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/n/d/Wikipedia%7EAnd_now_for_something_completely_different..._Bad_Jokes_and_Other_Deleted_Nonsense_3158.html#endnote_night" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/n/d/Wikipedia%7EAnd_now_for_something_completely_different..._Bad_Jokes_and_Other_Deleted_Nonsense_3158.html#endnote_night" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></sup></span> to design, in just two episodes. After the first appearance of the game in the manga (in Volume 2, Duel 9), the reader response on it was enormous<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_enormous"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/n/d/Wikipedia%7EAnd_now_for_something_completely_different..._Bad_Jokes_and_Other_Deleted_Nonsense_3158.html#endnote_enormous" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/n/d/Wikipedia%7EAnd_now_for_something_completely_different..._Bad_Jokes_and_Other_Deleted_Nonsense_3158.html#endnote_enormous" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></sup></span>, and <i><a href="../../../s/h/o/Shonen_Jump_b7bc.html" title="Shonen Jump">Shonen Jump</a></i> started getting calls from readers who wanted to know more about the game. Takahashi realized that he had hit on something, so he modified the storyline to feature more of the card game. With the advance of the manga, the game continued to evolve, becoming more complicated.</p>
<p>The similarities between the games, of note card design (brown with an oval on back), effects and terminology (discarding, graveyard, sacrifice), usage, and pictures (including <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occult.html" title="Occult">occult</a> or <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious.html" title="Religious">religious</a> based icons, alluding to the early days of <a href="../../../t/h/e/Magic%7E_The_Gathering_240a.html" title="Magic: The Gathering">Magic: The Gathering</a>) are all there. The name of Magic's creator is mirrored through the creator of Duel Monsters, Pegasus J. Crawford (<a href="../../../m/a/x/Maximillion_Pegasus_1cd8.html" title="Maximillion Pegasus">Maximillion Pegasus</a> in the English versions), whom both share the same number of letters.</p>

<p><i>Magic &amp; Wizards</i> has been brought to life in three versions, by two different companies. The first version, known as the Carddas version, was first released by <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bandai.html" title="Bandai">Bandai</a> in September 1998. Only three boosters had been released for this version before the license of the card game was sold to <a href="../../../k/o/n/Konami.html" title="Konami">Konami</a> later. The game was popular, although it used a simplified and modified version<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_version"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/n/d/Wikipedia%7EAnd_now_for_something_completely_different..._Bad_Jokes_and_Other_Deleted_Nonsense_3158.html#endnote_version" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/n/d/Wikipedia%7EAnd_now_for_something_completely_different..._Bad_Jokes_and_Other_Deleted_Nonsense_3158.html#endnote_version" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></sup></span> of the gaming rule used in the manga, and is less faithful to the manga compared with Konami's versions of the game.</p>
<p>The second version of the <i>Penis Muncher</i> cards was released by <a href="../../../k/o/n/Konami.html" title="Konami">Konami</a> on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_16.html" title="December 16">December 16</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>, included as special pack-in cards in the first <i>Penis Muncher</i> video game, <i>Penis Muncher Duel Monsters</i> <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_monsters"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/n/d/Wikipedia%7EAnd_now_for_something_completely_different..._Bad_Jokes_and_Other_Deleted_Nonsense_3158.html#endnote_monsters" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/n/d/Wikipedia%7EAnd_now_for_something_completely_different..._Bad_Jokes_and_Other_Deleted_Nonsense_3158.html#endnote_monsters" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></sup></span>. These cards are not to be mixed up with those of <i>Penis Muncher OCG</i> released later by the same company. The two versions are different in terms of design, with the looks of the former closer to those in the manga, to an extent that their effect texts are all directly quoted from the manga. Only 10 cards were released for this version, and Konami didn't have any gaming rules for these cards, as they were intended for collection purpose only. They cannot be used in the later-released <i>Penis Muncher OCG</i>.</p>
<p>The third version, <i>Penis Muncher OCG</i>, was first released on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_4.html" title="February 4">February 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>, by Konami. The gaming rule of this version is much more sophisticated and mature compared with the Carddas version, while at the same time does a much better job in preserving the style and feeling of <i>M&amp;W</i>. Succeeding the popular Carddas version, <i>Penis Muncher OCG</i> was an instant hit. And on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_1.html" title="March 1">March 1</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, the English version of the game was brought to the U.S. by <a href="../../../u/p/p/Upper_Deck_Entertainment_6052.html" title="Upper Deck Entertainment">Upper Deck Entertainment</a> under the new name, <i>Penis Muncher Trading Card Game</i>, with the release of its first set, <i>Legend of Blue-Eyes White Dragon</i>. Later on in the same year (<a href="../../../m/a/r/March_19.html" title="March 19">March 19</a>), Konami released its first <i>Penis Muncher</i> videogame in the U.S. for Gameboy Color, known as <i>Penis Muncher Dark Duel Stories</i>.</p>
<p>Currently, <i>Penis Muncher OCG/TCG</i> have been released in more than 40 countries.</p>

<p>Apart from <i>Magic &amp; Wizards</i>, there are also other games that were originally created as fictitious games for <i>Penis Muncher</i> manga and was later turned into video games, the most famous ones being:</p>
<ul>
<li><i><b>Capsule Monster Chess</b></i> (<i><b>Capmon</b></i>) — a sort of pre-<i><a href="../../../m/a/g/Mage_Knight_3154.html" title="Mage Knight">Mage Knight</a></i> collectible miniatures game. Video game: <i>www.konami.com/gs/capsulemonster/ Capsule Monster Coliseum</i></li>

<li><i><b>Dungeon Dice Monsters</b></i> (<i><b>DDM</b></i>), known in the Japanese manga as <i><b>Dragons Dice &amp; Dungeons</b></i> (<i><b>DDD</b></i>) — a <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dungeon_crawl.html" title="Dungeon crawl">dungeon crawl</a> boardgame where the tiles are created by unfolding the faces of 6-sided dice. Video game: <i>www.konami.com/gs/dungeondice/ Dungeon Dice Monsters</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Among the three, only <i>Dungeon Dice Monsters</i> has been released as a real collectible game, but the game wasn't popular, and currently no more new figures are released.

But so far, only three of the seven boosters in Japanese version have been released, with the last one released in June 2003.</p>

Born in Melbourne, Australia, in 1982 Liam was schooled at home for the most part by his mother until her death. His mother was killed by an enraged lemur at whilst visiting the Melbourne Zoo in 1987. His father, who had several mental disablities choked himself to death using his own trousers in 1993. Since those days Liam found solace in his Ocarina playing. Neighbours reported they could hear him long into the night practicing the saddest songs. Liam currently resides in Mildura, Victoria and records his albums at home.</p>

<p>The yankees are undoubtedly the gayest team in the history of baseball. They buy their way through a game, and then claim they win all the time for other reasons. Also, the red, white, and blue bunting that's a clear attempt at patriotic sucking up that really ticks me off. The devil rays are like thirty nine times better.</p>

<p>Robby is an amazing basketball player who can literally jump out of the gym. He enjoys long walks on the beach and binge drinking. It is well known that Robby Schoder once crushed a man by jumping on top of him like Mario does in his videogame.</p>
<p><b>Later:</b></p>
<p>Robby Schoder is a brilliant figure worthy of many accolades. His ability to do almost anything is unsurmountable for the average human being. Aside from being tremendously good looking, so good looking in fact that women practically stumble over themselves in awe of him. His incredible charisma makes even Zeus jealous. This man has incredible athletic abilities and shows them on the Junior Varsity basketball court, often times showcasing his water-boying skills in the real games, he demonstrates his athleticism as he leaps folding chairs to beat the managers to the water in order to have some part in games. In his first game of his varsity bench-warming career, he spilled water on coach Rick Malnati's pants- talk about a great first impression. He also has an incredible adeptness to the value of music, yet has no musical ability of his own, citing poor genes and generally terrible abilities to pick up a beat or a chord. He really has nothing going for him as far as musical ability is concerned. As far as brains go, he clearly did not get the brains in the family, as his third cousin a million times removed or something- Michael (the wrestler) Schoder- has applied to several Ivy Leagues and would easily beat Robby any day in any academic competition. Another amazing thing about Robby Schoder, is that he seemingly has an inherent ability to ward off fun times. Although the exciting moment comes around once in a blue moon, he spends most of his weekends with anywhere between 2-4 friends sitting in basements, wishing he were alot cooler than he really is, usually wishing that people who say they will call will... never actually doing it. Despite how much he sucks, he still manages to shine through and make people envy his every step because the ground he walks on is sacred.</p>

<p>Note: Like most egomaniacal dictators in charge of pseudo democratic, poverty stricken states - Omar Bongo Ondimba is lying, thieiving, murdering criminal. He rountinely arranges for "unfortunate" things to happen to those who oppose him and is goes without saying that the most recent election could not be described as in any way representative of the will of the people.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Gabon doesn't have enough resources (oil, diamonds, water etc) for anyone to bother "liberating" it from it's current leadership. It's also got, like really big mosquitos ... and some venemous creatures or something? I also apparently don't have a spell checker, or know anything at all about Gabon, but like duuuuude....Any president in power for over 15 years has got to be a major scummy piss bag - like why don't you look up like that chow-chess-q dude, from that eastern european country, that like had that documentary made about it, that last dictator they had was a piss-bag... though he did have that sweet (but cruel) massive castle/palace built for himself., uuuuhh you know - defacing wikipedia in a really entertaining way has got to merit some kind of web award - like .... best wiki-scrawl or whatever it is - it's totally an art form, ...uhhhh, hmmmmmm..... don't you just hate run-on sentences - but at least I don't use that freakin txt writing - stupid short form bastardization of the language..... erm...... ok, that's about it....</p>

<p>The Anus language is part of the Sarmi-Jayapura Bay language group. Native Anus speakers are famed worldwide for their witty banter, overcoming the fact that the language includes no proper Nouns whatsoever. Members of the tribe acknowledge each other by the inclusion of the suffix Cox'icks. To touch the head of a tribal leader is consideredr very polite, and will not result in cannibalism. Experience of this custom is considered necessary for the full hands on approach to understanding the fascinating culture of the Anus.</p>
<p>The most famous Anus speaker is Adrian Boynton, most famous for his work alongside Brian Blessed in Elgar's oratorio King Olaf, whose melodic mouth organ recordings have only been matched by his literary output. His critical work Penetrating Wagner's Ring is recognised as a leading textbook on the subject of that composer.</p>

<p><b>I have invented new Democracy</b></p>
<p>Some words of preview. I'm Russian guy and I'm tired of understanding how week Democracy in our country. I watch TV, listen to radio every day and I see, how inofficious choisen people govern our country. I've found that most of them were choisen by simple people, who were attracted by expressive words, which have no any strength. The fact is, they rool our country, not understanding real things.</p>
<pre>
            <b> Simple peoples are the basis of our country </b>
             because they make up the largest part of it.
</pre>
<p>They can choose any one they think the best.So more advansed people, who are in lack, will automatically fail in this game, named Democracy.</p>
<pre>
             <b>I suggest new system of voting, which include</b>
             rating based votes.
</pre>
<p>Every men and woman in the country must have its universal rating number, which he or she gets according to his or her achievements during the life or they must pass so called IQ test before voting. The result of test determines the vote rating of the person. This rating may be 1000 or 1, depending on intellect of the person. So summ of all ratings of voted persons defines the real strength of their votes. So in this case the more advansed people can win.</p>

<p>The Fartbutts originated in Ancient <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyria.html" title="Assyria">Assyria</a> where a lone priest, Bebbakar of the Assyrian noble family, denied the current <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">religion</a> because he claimed a butt talked to him and told him to start Buttfartism. His colleagues denounced his vision, claiming that said butt had only farted. The priest, undaunted, gathered his followers and farted. He then created a separate society within present day <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syria.html" title="Syria">Syria</a>, while his brother took a small contingent to spread the teachings of Fartbuttism. He took a fleet and crossed the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_Ocean_570a.html" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>, ending up in current day <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia.html" title="Virginia">Virginia</a>.</p>

<p>In the early <a href="../../../1/2/t/12th_Century_6011.html" title="12th Century">12th Century</a>, the Crusades began. Europeans championing <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> and especially castigating the principles of Buttfartism invaded the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_East_c1c7.html" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>, and the golden age of Fartbuttism was at an end. They were persecuted by their <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> overlords, and thus the Great Fartbutt Genocide began. Correspondingly, the remaining Fartbutts rallied around the current <i>High Fartbutt</i>, and mass farted. In the confusion, Fartastic the Butt lead a small batallion, hoping to reunite with the growing Fartbutt settlement in Virginia. However, Richard the ButtSlayer attacked Fartastic's fart batallions, and in the ensuing chaos a small fleet of Fartbutts managed to escape, beginning the perilous journey to Mongolia in the Great Fartbutt Migration of 1288.</p>
<p>The Fartbutt colony across the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic.html" title="Atlantic">Atlantic</a>, however, was thriving. Eventually <a href="../../../b/r/i/British.html" title="British">British</a> colonists began to settle there, and the Fartbutts welcomed them with open farts. The British, mistaking them to be filthy <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_American_33b5.html" title="Native American">Native American</a> <a href="../../../s/a/v/Savages.html" title="Savages">savages</a>, welcomed them with muskets and <a href="../../../s/m/a/Smallpox.html" title="Smallpox">smallpox</a> blankets. The Fartbutts fled from their shore dwellings in Virginia to current day <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas.html" title="Kansas">Kansas</a>. They remained there in relative peace until the <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_Century_16f1.html" title="19th Century">19th Century</a>, when Americans, fearing their farts, resorted to violence to expel the Fartbutts from America. In the event known as <a href="../../../b/l/e/Bleeding_Kansas_59d7.html" title="Bleeding Kansas">Bleeding Kansas</a>, most of the population of the Farbutts was massacred secretly, while a few slave owners were killed as a cover story. <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_E_Lee_6906.html" title="Robert E Lee">Robert E Lee</a>'s performance in the massacre was so astounding that he was immediately promoted to the rank of general.

<p>The Fartbutt people have a very rich folk culture. Their traditional dress consists of a garmant where an assortment of butts is interspersed with abstract farts (or vice versa) (butt). The annual festival, comparable to the traditional <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> Holiday, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas.html" title="Christmas">Christmas</a>, is <a href="../../../k/w/a/Kwanzaa.html" title="Kwanzaa">FartButt Kwanzaa</a> where FartButts are all required to wear funny hats and parade down the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mongolian.html" title="Mongolian">Mongolian</a> dirt roads carrying a gargatuan butt. They also hold a traditional practice called <i>fartbutting</i> where they periodically bow to one another, and subsequently, fart.</p>
<p>There is, albeit unfortunately, a rigid caste system within the FartButt colonies (which are underground, in farts).</p>
<p>The Caste System is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>FartFarts
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../b/u/t/Butts.html" title="Butts">Butts</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Saget_81bf.html" title="Bob Saget">Bob Saget</a>

<ul>
<li>Unfartables</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The FartButts also adhere to the Fartbutt religion called <i>BUTTFARTISM</i>, practiced during the <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crusades.html" title="Crusades">Crusades</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/e/Bleeding_Kansas_59d7.html" title="Bleeding Kansas">Bleeding Kansas</a> but was quickly suppressed by <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_III_3436.html" title="Richard III">Richard the ButtSlayer</a>. In following years, Fartbutts gradually took refuge in underground caverns in <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mongolia.html" title="Mongolia">Mongolia</a>. They named the caverns farts, in remembrance of the fallen comrades lost in Butt War I and the Plague of Farts(because they farted a lot). The religion has evolved into the present day Buttfartism. Buttfartism hails Lord ButtFart(comparable to the pope, minus his HILARIOUS HAT) but adding a butt(on his anterior).</p>

<p>Fartbutt grammar is quite difficult. Depending on the caste of the FartButts, one may or may not use informal FartButt vocabulary. For example, if a specific FartButt is a member of the <i>FARTFART</i> caste, then an Unfartable may only refer to him as <i>Father FartFart</i>.</p>

<p>The peoples who profess the Fartbutt language have been discriminated against for centuries. While motivations for these heinous crimes against the Fartbutt peoples are often debated, it has been made clear that a primary reason behind them is the fact that FartButt peoples fart (out of their butts). Neo Buttslayers (see Richard the Buttslayer) constantly persecute the Fartbutts, and they are forced to remain in hiding.</p>

<p>Currently there are no tourists in the farts of <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mongolia.html" title="Mongolia">Mongolia</a> because of the Seventeenth Unfartable Revolution, which has currently left these caverns devastated and dangerous(and the farts).
