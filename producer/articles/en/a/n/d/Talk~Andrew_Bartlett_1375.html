<p>I’m relatively new to wikipedia so someone feel free to correct me but isn’t something that claims to be an encyclopedia meant to at least try to be accurate?</p>
<p>The section on Senator Bartlett’s Leadership of the Democrats seems to me to be pretty biased and one-sided - quite apart from the fact that it contains inaccurate and unsubstantiated assertions which are presented as fact, and that the entry almost entirely ignores Bartlett's entire record as Leader and focuses instead on reinforcing the distortions of a single tabloid media incident.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>It quotes Woodley as saying Bartlett is an alcoholic - without any reference. All I ever saw in the media at that time from Woodley was that he said that some people had concerns about Bartlett’s drinking.</p>
<p>The suggestion that Bartlett seemed to confirm he is an alcoholic is incorrect - he quite specifically did not. He did say he had some heath problems which were made worse by drinking alcohol. It’s a very different thing.</p>
<p>Bartlett did not stand down from the Leadership he stood aside and took leave for a month.</p>
<p>Bartlett never confirmed Ferris’s allegations – not denying something is not a confirmation – it’s a decision to not get into the argument.</p>
<p>He had not been drinking at a Democrats Christmas party before being invited to join the Liberal Party event. The Democrats function was the evening before.</p>
<p>If you look at these recent entries on his blog it is very apparent he does not confirm Ferris’s allegations.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p>“I remember in my own circumstance when I was copping a lot of criticism over allegations about my behaviour, some people who had seen the alleged ‘incident’ contacted me to commiserate at how distorted and exaggerated the public portrayal of it was. However, I appreciate that it was impractical to expect them to say so publicly, given the politics of the situation.”</p>
<p>August 28 <a href="http://andrewbartlettonline.blogspot.com/2005/08/press-gallery-journalists-face-jail.html" class="external free" title="http://andrewbartlettonline.blogspot.com/2005/08/press-gallery-journalists-face-jail.html" rel="nofollow">http://andrewbartlettonline.blogspot.com/2005/08/press-gallery-journalists-face-jail.html</a></p>
<p>“Some people may see it as ironic that I would defend Harvey and McManus in regard to receiving leaked information, as they were key writers of the front page story in the Herald Sun in December 2003 which contained leaked allegations about an argument I had with Liberal Senator Jeannie Ferris. That story was damaging to the Democrats and very hurtful for my family, (as the person who composed and planted the allegations knew it would be), but I can't really blame the journalists for that. Although the story contained some exaggerations, they basically just reported the allegations they were given, which were framed specifically so it would cause damage when leaked .”</p>
<p>And from this speech to the senate August 16 2005 (Australian Hansard page no 86) <a href="http://parlinfoweb.aph.gov.au/piweb/view_document.aspx?ID=2233037&amp;TABLE=HANSARDS&amp;TARGET=" class="external free" title="http://parlinfoweb.aph.gov.au/piweb/view_document.aspx?ID=2233037&amp;TABLE=HANSARDS&amp;TARGET=" rel="nofollow">http://parlinfoweb.aph.gov.au/piweb/view_document.aspx?ID=2233037&amp;TABLE=HANSARDS&amp;TARGET=</a></p>
<p>“From personal experience I can see why some people do not give unconditional apologies. I recall doing something once that somebody took offence to, so I thought the appropriate thing to do was to apologise unconditionally. That was then taken as open season by everybody as being a clear admission of guilt for whatever farcical allegation anybody wanted to make for the next week. I had to enjoy the pleasures of considerable media attention outside my fence for a solid week, and my wife and child also had to cope with that for a week. Of course, the person who leaked that information knew that is what would happen, because they told me that is what would happen before they decided to leak it.</p>
<p>The fact is that if somebody indicates that they have taken offence to something and that is what occurs—somebody stands up, takes a point of order and says, ‘I object to that’—then I think the appropriate thing to do is to apologise. I do not think it is necessary to go into all the context surrounding it. I did not do that in that case, either. I did not talk about the things that were said to me or the context as to why I might take offence. That did not stop the Prime Minister criticising and saying, ‘The facts speak for themselves,’ even though he did not know what the facts were, or stop the Labor Premier of Queensland calling on me to resign, even though he did not know what the facts were. A whole lot of other people passed comment, including some members of my own party, none of whom ever asked me for my side of the story.”</p>
<p>I think it shows an extraordinary bias to include a long quote from Ferris while there is nothing from Bartlett himself, especially as it’s very clear from the statement above that there was much more to the exchange than Ferris claims.</p>
<p>I attempted to correct these things previously but the page has been changed back again. I hadn’t registered as a member at that time but have done so now.</p>
<p>Flora --Flora Morton 12:48, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Bartlett has had nearly two years to deny (a) that he was drunk, (b) that he stole the wine from the Liberal Party function, (c) that he grabbed Ferris's arm and called her a "fucking bitch", and (d) that he followed her out of the chamber while verbally abusing her. Since he hasn't denied these allegations, which have been in the public arena all this time (and some of which were recorded on video), we are entitled to take that as an admission of guilt. Bartlett is a politician and knows that. When he makes a statement denying that he did those things, the article can quote that statement. None of the quotes above are denials, they are just fishing for sympathy and blame-someone-elses for his behaviour (classic alcoholic-in-denial behavior, by the way).</p>
<p>Bartlett has in fact admitted both the facts of the Ferris incident and that he is, or was, an alcoholic. See this <a href="http://bulletin.ninemsn.com.au/bulletin/EdDesk.nsf/All/A62F824B96D58D67CA256E2B000954E7" class="external text" title="http://bulletin.ninemsn.com.au/bulletin/EdDesk.nsf/All/A62F824B96D58D67CA256E2B000954E7" rel="nofollow"><i>Bulletin</i> article</a>, with which he co-operated. Woodley is quoted there to the same effect, as he was at the time. If Bartlett now says that people "don't know what the facts are," he is perfectly free to put his own version of the facts on the record. Until he does so, he can't complain if the current version of the facts is accepted as true.</p>
<p>If the detail about which party he had been drinking at is wrong, it should be corrected.</p>
<p>If you feel there is not enough positive stuff about the rest of Bartlett's political career, you are free to add more. But the fact is that his career consists of being a cross-bench Senator for seven years, and briefly being leader of a minor party. He hasn't actually <i>done</i> anything much except make nice speeches and lead the Dems to their worst-ever election result.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 13:52, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Adam using your own criteria you would have to then also assume that every allegation made about Mark Latham which he didn't deny should be assumed to be true – and that means you’d have to edit out most of what’s on his page and reduce it to being 90% on his post-election burn out, dismissing all the stuff he did during his leadership as flaky and focusing just on his 'instability' , 'erratic behaviour' etc, because that’s about all you'd get on him from most of the main stream media these days. And are you suggesting that all of the allegations that the Daily Telegraph made about John Brogden must be true, because he hasn't categorically denied them?</p>
<p>I’ve read The Bulletin article you refer too – but can not find a quote from Bartlett that even remotely says "I am an alcoholic". The 'genetically predisposed to alcoholism' line is not in quotes so obviously is not one , and in any case having a possible genetic predisposition to alcoholism is very different from him saying he is one.</p>
<p>I did not read Bartlett’s blog entries or his speech as fishing for sympathy, but an indication that the reporting of this incident was selective and one sided.</p>
<p>In any case your assertion that Bartlett hasn't actually achieved anything much during his time as a Senator is ridiculous and completely dismisses the solid body of work he has done particularly in the area of refugees and animal welfare, not to mention substantial environmental gains. In fact that whole statement indicates a political bias that is inappropriate for someone editing this page.</p>
<p>I have added in to the article some of the things Bartlett worked on and achieved while Democrats Leader. I also think the long quote from Ferris is inappropriate – it is her view and not substantiated - and should be removed. Flora Morton 14:38, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I appreciate your loyalty Flora but that really is a load of tosh.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bartlett was accused of specific acts of misconduct which he has never denied. Given the gravity of the accusations and their consequences, that can only mean that the accusations were correct (which no-one disputed at the time), and that he accepted them (very wise given that he was <i>filmed</i> accosting Ferris). If politicians are accused of things they're not guilty of, believe me, they deny them.</li>
<li>The <i>Bulletin</i> article clearly implies that he is or was an alcoholic, and he made no attempt to refute that, either when interviewed or after publication. If he had wanted to deny it he could have done so, and indeed if it wasn't true he could have sued.</li>
<li>Since Bartlett had the courage to admit these things at the time, I think you might do him the courtesy of acknowledging them and not come up with these feeble denials two years later.</li>
<li>As for his work, as I said, you are free to add more about his career if you want.</li>
<li>If you delete the Ferris quote I will revert you.</li>
<li>I'm off to bed now - chat again tomorrow. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 14:57, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Well tosh to you too Adam!&#160;:-)</p>
<p>I’m not suggesting the incident did not happen or should not be referred to.</p>
<p>I don’t agree that Bartlett’s refusal to comment beyond apologising “for causing offence” at the time, means he is therefore automatically guilty of every accusation thrown his way.</p>
<p>The lengthy quote from Ferris is inappropriate especially as there is no quote from Bartlett himself or any reference to comments by other senators who witnessed the incident such as in this Sydney Morning Herald article <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/02/09/1076175091543.html?from=storyrhs" class="external free" title="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/02/09/1076175091543.html?from=storyrhs" rel="nofollow">http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/02/09/1076175091543.html?from=storyrhs</a> where Liberal Senator Brett Mason, is quoted as saying "Perhaps a little more was made of the incident than should have been made. I think it was overplayed by the media, and by everyone.” (That article by the way does also contain quotes from Bartlett himself.) Or even in the Bulletin article you refer to, ALP Senator Claire Moore is quoted as saying of Bartlett “He has been absolutely, unfairly demonized.”</p>
<p>Wikipedia, by emphasizing that one incident to the degree it does and by the one sided way that section is written, seems to be accepting and following a sensationalist media line rather than maintaining an unbiased balanced stance that I personally think is more appropriate for an encyclopedia.</p>
<p>Anyway I’ve said what I think and as you’ve said you won’t allow further change I’ll leave it now. --Flora Morton 06:15, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
