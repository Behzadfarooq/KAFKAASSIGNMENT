<p>Andrew Chord was a soldier in the army during the Vietnam war. His unit (calling themselves the "Half Fulls") was in the plateu dus bolovens north of the se kong river in Cambodia where they were looking to scout locations for a possible landing base for American aircraft. His unit of six soldiers (including Night Thrasher's father Daryl Taylor, Diego Cassaes aka the <a href="../../../l/e/f/Left_Hand_%28comics%29_eb7c.html" title="Left Hand (comics)">Left Hand</a> and the fathers of the members of the <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folding_Circle_b287.html" title="Folding Circle">Folding Circle</a>) encountered a mysterious temple known as the temple of the dragon's breadth. They soon encountered a seemingly English speaking Cambodian geriatric named Tai who restrained them via magic. Tai explained to the soldiers the history of her people and the need for the soldiers to mate with six young women from her cult. The soldiers were lead to believe that through these matings their children would one day rule the world. Five of the soldiers agreed to this pact...Daryl Taylor refused his bride because he was already married to his wife Melody.</p>
<p>Chord was married off to Tai's only daughter Miyami and brought his new bride home with him to America. Miyami soon gave birth to their two biracial children Silhouette and Midnight's Fire (possibly not their birth names). Miyami did not want her children to be used as Tai's pawns so she faked their deaths and her own in a car crash. Miyami left her children to be raised in Manhattan's Chinatown and departed for parts unknown.</p>
<p>Chord believing his wife and children were dead began to travel the world as a mercenary. He eventually returned to the dragon breadth's temple in Cambodia where he renewed his association with his mother-in-law Tai. Tai believing her grandchilden were dead sought to have a replacement to fulfill Chord's role in the pact. To this end she convinced Chord to resume his friendship with former army buddy Daryl Taylor and his wife Melody. Chord became godfather to their infant son Dwayne Taylor. Tai one day returned and demanded Chord kill Daryl and Melody to fulfill his role in the pact. Chord reluctantly did as he was told and shot his friends in a crowded restaurant in front of six year old Dwayne. At this time Dwayne first met Tai and his memory of the event was erased by Tai.</p>
<p>Chord and Tai trained Dwayne to be a crime fighter to avenge the murders of his parents never revealing their role in the incident. They also ran Dwayne's business affairs in Daryl Taylor's charitable organization the Taylor Foundation, often investing the money in illegal operations all over the globe. Dwayne eventually became friends with fellow crime fighters Silhouette and Midnight's Fire. Tai and Chord did not realize their familial relation to Dwayne's new friends but they disapproved of Dwayne's friendship with them and of Dwayne's romance with Silhouette. The partnership between Dwayne and the siblings ended when Chord's daughter Silhouette was crippled during a failed undercover operation by the gunshots of a Korean gangmember.</p>
<p>Due to Chord and Tai's urging Dwayne became <a href="../../../n/i/g/Night_Thrasher_a06f.html" title="Night Thrasher">Night Thrasher</a> and assembled a young team of superheroes named the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Warriors_7094.html" title="New Warriors">New Warriors</a>. Chord often served as their pilot. Tai had hoped to sacrifice the New Warriors to the well of the Dragon's Breadth cult in place of the members of the Folding Circle (the children from the matings of the soldiers and the female maidens) and absorb the power released from their sacrifice.</p>
<p>Eventually Night Thrasher uncovered Chord's abuse of Taylor Foundation funds and confronted him. To keep from answering these questions Chord tricked the other New Warriors into thinking Dwayne was being controlled by some outside force. Eventually Chord's deception was uncovered. Chord chose to shoot himself in the head rather than reveal the truth. Marvel Boy rushed a dying Chord to the hospital.</p>
<p>While in the hospital Chord admitted to killing Night Thrasher's parents. While he was in the hospital his wife Miyami came to visit. Tai murdered Miyami when she discoved Miyami's deception about the car crash. Chord was partially healed by Tai via magic. He still had to endure months of rehab to recover from his injuries.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards Chord concocted an elaborate plot to stage his own kidnapping and frame other corrupt members of the Taylor Foundation board. Chord's goal was for Dwayne to investigate the dirty dealings of the foundation and to take a proactive interest in the company's dealings. Chord wanted Dwayne to continue the good work of the foundation.</p>
<p>Chord and his former mercenary buddy <a href="../../../s/p/r/Sprocket_%28comics%29.html" title="Sprocket (comics)">Sprocket</a> later helped Dwayne uncover the truth about his father's illegitimate son <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bandit_%28comics%29.html" title="Bandit (comics)">Donyell</a>. When the New Warriors were sent to various points in time by the <a href="../../../s/p/h/Sphinx_%28comics%29.html" title="Sphinx (comics)">Sphinx</a>, Chord and Sprocket helped Hindsight Lad recruit a new team of Warriors to battle the Sphinx.</p>
<p>Chord hasn't been seen since Night Thrasher's series ended.</p>
