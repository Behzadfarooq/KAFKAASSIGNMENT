However, one of the Commonwealth's member species, the genetically engineered <a href="../../../n/i/e/Nietzschean_%28Andromeda%29_bb26.html" title="Nietzschean (Andromeda)">Nietzscheans</a>, ostensibly becomes disillusioned with the peace with the <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magog_%28Andromeda%29_367e.html" title="Magog (Andromeda)">Magog</a>, and attempts to overthrow and conquer the Commonwealth. This is in line with the philosophy of this species, who could be described as elitist <a href="../../../p/o/s/Posthuman.html" title="Posthuman">post-humans</a>, ruthlessly ambitious in their interpretation of the "<a href="../../../%C3%BC/b/e/%C3%9Cbermensch.html" title="Übermensch">Übermensch</a>" of <a href="../../../n/i/e/Nietzsche.html" title="Nietzsche">Nietzsche</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../d/y/l/Dylan_Hunt_1b98.html" title="Dylan Hunt">Dylan Hunt</a>, the captain of a key Commonwealth flagship (which is itself sentient and therefore a major character), is caught by surprise in the first engagement of this uprising, which includes Nietzschean members of his own crew, and is forced to evacuate his crew, but his ship, the <i><a href="../../../a/n/d/Andromeda_Ascendant_aeb6.html" title="Andromeda Ascendant">Andromeda Ascendant</a></i>, gets caught on the edge of a <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_hole.html" title="Black hole">black hole</a>'s <a href="../../../e/v/e/Event_horizon.html" title="Event horizon">event horizon</a>, freezing him in time. Over 300 years later, a <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salvage.html" title="Salvage">salvage</a> crew (on the cargo ship <i><a href="../../../e/u/r/Eureka_Maru_13b1.html" title="Eureka Maru">Eureka Maru</a></i>) rescues him. The Systems Commonwealth has fallen, leading to a dark age known as the Long Night. Hunt recruits the salvage crew to join him in an attempt to restore the Systems Commonwealth and "rekindle the light of <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civilization.html" title="Civilization">civilization</a>."</p>
<p>The salvage crew is comprised of: its leader, a con-artist and expert pilot named <a href="../../../b/e/k/Beka_Valentine_ebd1.html" title="Beka Valentine">Beka Valentine</a>; a Nietzschean hit-man named <a href="../../../t/y/r/Tyr_Anasazi_2f89.html" title="Tyr Anasazi">Tyr Anasazi</a> (of the key but small Kodiak pride of Nietzscheans); a supergenius engineer named <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seamus_Zelazny_Harper_454a.html" title="Seamus Zelazny Harper">Seamus Harper</a> (rescued off of Nietzschean-enslaved Earth by Beka) who can plug his mind directly into computer systems; <a href="../../../r/e/v/Rev_Bem_ece9.html" title="Rev Bem">Rev Bem</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trance_Gemini_0a3a.html" title="Trance Gemini">Trance Gemini</a>.

Season One cast</div>

<p>Season One of the series shows Dylan Hunt assembling the crew and adjusting to the new universe, while pursuing the creation of the New Systems Commonwealth. The idea of the New Commonwealth proves unpopular; only 6 worlds actually sign the Commonwealth charter in this season. Major powers like the Than Hegemony or Sabra and Jaguar prides are not really interested in the Commonwealth; Dylan also manages to make quite a few enemies (including the most powerful Nietzschean pride, Drago-Kazov) himself.</p>
<p>Dylan also encounters several dysfunctional remnants of the old High Guard (to which he belonged) and witnesses the consequences of some of his own actions 300 years before. He realizes that the Old Commonwealth indeed had made some mistakes which he has to avoid.</p>
<p>The unification of <i>Andromeda</i>'s crew is a major theme of Season One. Dylan's new crew doesn't really believe in the idea of the Commonwealth, and joins him only for personal gain. To their surprise they find that having something to fight for is not a bad thing. In the season finale Beka (Dylan's First Officer) even promises him to continue his mission if he dies.</p>
<p>Trance is a particularly interesting member of the crew. Initially she seems to be a ditzy and naive girl, warm and compassionate but serving little actual purpose on the ship. But she is quickly demonstrated to be more than she seems. Apparently Trance has the ability to foresee the future (or, as she explains herself in one episode, all possible futures). She used this ability several times to help her friends, but her true goals remain unknown. The show hints that she engineered an entire historic event — the Battle of Witchhead, where the last remains of Old Commonwealth fleet were destroyed, taking most of the Nietzschean forces with them — by "accidentally" sending the <i>Andromeda</i> back in time and pulling various members of the crew by the right strings.</p>
<p>Dylan himself has a difficult time accepting the fact that the universe he lived in no longer exists and that all his friends are long dead. In a bizarre accident he actually manages to contact his fiancee Sara 300 years before and even to teleport on her ship — but he has to return back alone as he knows that the New Commonwealth is more important than his own life.</p>
<p>In the season finale the <i>Andromeda</i> encounters the Magog Worldship, a huge structure of twenty connected planets and an artificial sun. The Worldship contains trillions of Magog and is equipped with a unique weapon — the Point Singularity Projector which creates miniature black holes. <i>Andromeda</i> is heavily damaged, Tyr and Harper are abducted to the Worldship (and followed by Rev), and the rest of the crew are badly injured.</p>
<p><a name="Season_Two" id="Season_Two"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andromeda_%28TV_series%29_2ef3.html" title="Edit section: Season Two">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Season Two</span></h3>
<p>Season Two begins with the crew of <i>Andromeda</i> in the seemingly hopeless situation. However, Dylan is revived by Trance and goes to the Worldship with Rommie (which is short for "Andromeda." The ship itself is sentient, and has both holographic and android avatars; Rommie is the nickname usually used for the free-roaming android avatar) to recover Tyr, Harper and Rev. Tyr and Harper are both infested with Magog eggs, and Rev's loyalty is strained when he encounters the being known as the <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spirit_of_the_Abyss_4d39.html" title="Spirit of the Abyss">Spirit of the Abyss</a>, the creator and god of the Magog. Although Dylan rescues everyone, he suffers heavy losses. <i>Andromeda</i> is badly damaged, Rev has a spiritual crisis, and there seems to be no possible way to extract the Magog larvae from Harper, so he has only a few months to live. (The larvae are extracted in "Ouroboros" episodes.)</p>
<p>The season shows the crew reacting to the sudden necessity of the New Commonwealth after the discovery of the Worldship (which will arrive to the Known Worlds in a few years), as they continue to make sure the dream comes true. Many worlds became more willing to sign the charter after learning of the Worldship. Dylan becomes more ruthless in his actions as well.</p>
<p>The episode "Ouroboros" (2x12) in the middle of this season became a major turning point for the whole series. "Ouroboros" was the last episode of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Hewitt_Wolfe_3f82.html" title="Robert Hewitt Wolfe">Robert Hewitt Wolfe</a>, the show's original developer and head writer. The producers allegedly felt that the series was becoming too intellectual and complicated (see <a href="#Controversy_over_Robert_Hewitt_Wolfe.27s_departure" title="">Controversy over Robert Hewitt Wolfe's departure</a>). One immediately visible change was Trance's transformation. She exchanged places with her own future version; New Trance had a different (golden-skinned) appearance and much more serious personality.</p>
<p><a href="../../../b/r/e/Brent_Stait_5460.html" title="Brent Stait">Brent Stait</a> (Rev Bem) also left <i>Andromeda</i> in "Ouroboros" because of his developing allergy to Magog make-up. He reprises his role twice later, in Seasons Three and Four.</p>
<p>In the second half of Season Two, restoration of the Commonwealth becomes a much less significant theme. The show mostly concentrated on <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a></i>-style standalone adventures. However, by the end of the season the New Commonwealth had gained a new powerful warfleet and a total of fifty worlds.</p>
<p>Tyr is revealed to have a son, who is a genetic reincarnation of Drago Museveni, founder of Nietzschean race. Since the Nietzscheans believe that Drago's reincarnation will necessarily be a great leader, Tyr gets a unique opportunity to unite all Nietzschean prides. He doesn't use it yet, biding his time.</p>
<p>In the season finale the Commonwealth is finally reinstated. A ceremony is held on board of the <i>Andromeda</i>, but interrupted by the attack of unknown extradimensional aliens.</p>

<p>Controversy erupted during the midst of the second season when series developer and executive producer <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Hewitt_Wolfe_3f82.html" title="Robert Hewitt Wolfe">Robert Hewitt Wolfe</a> announced he had been released from the show's production, though his influence was felt through the completion of the second season; at that point, Bob Engels was brought on to executive produce the series. The reason for the change was purportedly to make the show more episodic and open to "casual viewing," as Wolfe's version — although episodic — had many continuing plotlines and story arcs. After the show's final episode aired, Wolfe wrote and published on his site a one-act play entitled <a href="http://www.rhwolfe.com/Insider%20Info.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.rhwolfe.com/Insider%20Info.htm" rel="nofollow">"Coda"</a> that explained his version of the show (and without contradicting the already aired episodes).</p>
<p>In discussion on his website's forums and various interviews over the last two years, Wolfe has elaborated that he was released from the production staff after he refused to shift the show's focus more heavily onto <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Sorbo_1236.html" title="Kevin Sorbo">Kevin Sorbo</a>'s character, Dylan Hunt, by essentially making all of the show's episodes Hunt-centric. The events of the episode "Ouroboros", the final episode written by Wolfe, introduced the last major changes that Wolfe was willing to make to the series.</p>
<p>When Engels took over and the show began the more "episodic" format, reactions from fans were mixed. The new producers tried to lighten the "doom and gloom" seriousness of the original story arc, while at the same time focusing more on the Dylan Hunt character. As a result, many felt that the quality of the series had declined.</p>
<p>Continuity, at least, did indeed break down, as in a Season Five episode, Dylan incorrectly referred to his stranding at the Battle of Witchhead, when in fact he was betrayed at the Battle of Hephaistos. The Battle of Witchhead took place one year later, and was influenced by the time-travelling crew of the Andromeda from 302 years in the future.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andromeda_%28TV_series%29_2ef3.html" title="Edit section: Season Three">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Season Three</span></h3>
<p>Season Three had the most episodic format of all. The Commonwealth is already reunited, but there is not much progress in the fight with the Magog and the Abyss.</p>
<p>Several episodes of Season Three explore Trance and her actual role. One episode (<i>The Dark Backward</i>) is filmed completely from Trance's viewpoint, showing that she indeed "lives" through all possible alternate futures before choosing the right one.</p>
<p>This season shows several confusing additions, refits, and changes to the Andromeda, its crew and the Commonwealth. The Andromeda gains a highly trained High guard crew in some episodes only to have them disappear in the next, leaving the core command crew to deal with problems on the ship without help. The capabilities of the ship increase and decrease and the characters often react in ways which are contrary to their established personalities. Most noteworthy is the appearance of multiple squadrons of slip fighters who fight under Beka's staunch leadership in the final episode, when in the previous episode, where a squadron of slipfighters would have been handy, they are not utilized.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Tyr makes his move in the end of the season. He implants his son's <a href="../../../d/n/a/DNA_396c.html" title="DNA">DNA</a> into his own cells, and goes on to reunite the Nietzscheans and separate them from the Commonwealth again. The season ends with Nietzscheans withdrawing from the Commonwealth and Tyr leaving the <i>Andromeda</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andromeda_%28TV_series%29_2ef3.html" title="Edit section: Season Four">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Season Four</span></h3>
<p>In Season Four, Dylan is nearly outlawed by the Commonwealth he had restored himself. The Collectors (originally keepers of historical information unknown to anyone else), allied with the Abyss, manipulate the government of the New Commonwealth to show him in a bad light. The Abyss infiltrates the Commonwealth using many other agents as well.</p>
<p>Eventually the Collectors unite with Tyr and his Nietzscheans. Tyr mistrusts the Abyss, but hopes to defeat it. He tries to find a map to the <a href="../../../r/o/u/Route_of_Ages_8e07.html" title="Route of Ages">Route of Ages</a> — a portal connecting all universes together. It is possible to weaken the Abyss by passing through it. Dylan gets the map instead, but he allows Tyr to follow <i>Andromeda</i> through the Route of Ages, as Tyr knows more about the Abyss. <i>Andromeda</i> is transported into a weird universe where the thoughts can become manifest. With Trance's help, Dylan defeats Tyr who tried to make a deal with the Abyss.</p>
<p>Since the Route of Ages closes before the <i>Andromeda</i> can get back, Dylan has to use Trance's help. She reveals that she is the Avatar of the Sun, with "the power to create and destroy". Trance destroys <i>Andromeda</i> and re-creates it in the right universe.</p>
<p>In this season, Dylan also finds a new crew member — Nietzschean <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telemachus_Rhade_51c6.html" title="Telemachus Rhade">Telemachus Rhade</a>, who doesn't accept his race's betrayal of the Commonwealth and agrees to join Dylan. Rhade proves to be more manageable than Tyr.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magog_%28Andromeda%29_367e.html" title="Magog (Andromeda)">Magog</a> evolve and become more intelligent and cunning. In the season finale their Worldship is rediscovered. It is heading towards the Arkology, an old space station with very pacifist population. Dylan frantically tries to convince them that they have to defend themself, but people of Arkology hope to make peace with the Magog.</p>
<p>They pay dearly for that mistake, as the Magog never make peace with anyone. <i>Andromeda</i> tries to defend the Arkology against the Worldship, but is outnumbered horribly. The Arkology is destroyed with all its inhabitants. Rhade, Beka and Harper are left in absolutely hopeless situations. Rommie explodes after being shot through her stomach.</p>
<p>Trance asks Dylan to escape on a slipfighter through the Route of Ages, claiming that now there is nothing more important than saving his life; Marlowe, Arkology's leader (who had disappeared several hours before the battle) tells Dylan that they both are <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paradine.html" title="Paradine">Paradine</a>, two of the few ancient beings with incredible powers. Dylan reluctantly leaves through the Route (in a strange sequence where he finds himself in a large dark room and seemingly meets another version of himself). Trance turns into a sun and crashes into the Worldship on the <i>Andromeda</i>.</p>
<p>The writers didn't know at the time whether there would be a Season Five, so the finale is intentionally ambiguous (which arguably makes it more dramatic). It seemingly shows that everyone except Dylan had died in the battle, but in Season Five everyone survived.</p>

Season Five cast.</div>

<p>Season Five starts with an unusual premise. Dylan finds himself transported into <a href="../../../s/e/e/Seefra.html" title="Seefra">Seefra</a> system — nine identical barren worlds with superstitious population and two dim suns. Technology (especially spaceflight) is shunned, and water is treasured because of constant drought. Flavin, another <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paradine.html" title="Paradine">Paradine</a>, meets Dylan here but gives only cryptic hints and leaves soon.</p>
<p>Dylan finds Rhade, Beka and Harper on Seefra, but, to his amazement, they all spent different periods of time here. Harper, in particular, arrived three years earlier with the remains of Rommie. He tried to repair her but failed, eventually building another android, Doyle, with some of Rommie's memories. Initially he convinces her that she is human, but later her true identity is revealed by a rebel android. (The "behind the scenes" reason for replacing Rommie with Doyle is Lexa Doig's pregnancy. Rommie was rebuilt by Doyle late in this season.)</p>
<p>Trance is also found, but she is weakened by her attempt to transport <i>Andromeda</i> and its crew to Seefra. She doesn't quite remember who she is and what she is supposed to do. Trance underwent a metamorphosis yet again; she is still golden-skinned but appears younger, and her personality resembles her first purple incarnation.</p>
<p><i>Andromeda</i> itself is transported to Seefra as well, but it has no power and no way to restore it. Trance partially recharges the ships generators, but <i>Andromeda</i> still cannot move, and its AI behavior is erratic.</p>
<p>The first half of the season deals with three main themes: Dylan's conflict with his crew, his attempts to restore Andromeda's power and eventual discovery of the true role of Trance and Seefra system.</p>
<p>Rhade, Beka and Harper are all angry at Dylan for leaving them behind in the Battle of Arkology and for throwing them to Seefra without any way to return back to the Known Worlds. Their loyalty is strained several times, but seems finally reaffirmed after the intervention by Stranger, a Paradine sent by Dylan from an alternate future.</p>
<p><i>Andromeda</i>'s power is eventually restored with ancient Vedran artifacts, but it is still unable to leave Seefra. Seefra seems to be located in a "pocket universe," and the only way out is the <a href="../../../r/o/u/Route_of_Ages_8e07.html" title="Route of Ages">Route of Ages</a>. Although some characters come and leave through it, Dylan can't use it.</p>
<p>Seefra turns out to be <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tarn-Vedra_5079.html" title="Tarn-Vedra">Tarn-Vedra</a>, long lost capital of the Commonwealth. But Vedrans themselves left it long ago, disillusioned with humans. Seefra-1 is the original Tarn-Vedra and Seefra-2 to 9 are copies of it. Tarn-Vedra's original sun was somehow replaced by two artificial constructs, Methus-1 and Methus-2. Methus-2 is now damaged and emits deadly flares, which are the reason for Seefra's drought.</p>
<p>Methus Diagram — a blueprint for Seefra system, recovered with the help of mysterious DJ Virgil Vox — also reveals the purpose of the eight extra planets. The Vedran sun will return someday, and destroy Seefra-2 to 9 in order to slow down and take its position. But because of the damage to Methus-2 this mechanism is not working, and the sun threatens to devastate the system completely.</p>
<p>Trance remembers her identity when she meets <a href="../../../i/o/n/Ione.html" title="Ione">Ione</a>, avatar of the Tarn-Vedra moon. She <i>is</i> the Tarn-Vedra sun. When she realizes this, her sun enters the Seefra system, and Dylan has to find a way to fix Methus-2 and evacuate eight doomed planets to Seefra-1.</p>
<p>Trance's "sisters" (who call themself "the Nebula"), however, try to persuade her to join them. In their opinion the fate of Dylan, Seefra or the Known Worlds is irrelevant. Trance stubbornly refuses, and the Nebula attempts to replace her (all Avatars of the Suns look alike). Real Trance is imprisoned inside Methus-2, and it takes some time for Dylan to realize the deception and rescue her.</p>
<p>Dylan proceeds with the evacuation of the Seefra planets, although his plans are hindered by General Burma, a religious leader from Seefra-5. Burma is later revealed to be under the control of the Abyss.</p>
<p>In the series finale, the Vedran sun is back in its place and people are safe on Seefra-1. Trance then contacts the Nebula — the Lambent Kith Nebula, supreme council of the galaxies which includes fifty Avatars. Trance was once the oldest member of the Nebula, but disagreed with their views of organic life as something insignificant and left long ago. Together with Dylan she appeals to the Nebula and its leader <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maura.html" title="Maura">Maura</a>, who plans to destroy the Abyss by expanding the All Forces Nullification Point until it consumes all galaxies. This incidentally will destroy everything alive in existence; only Seefra will survive.</p>
<p>Maura refuses to reconsider their plans, but allows Dylan and the <i>Andromeda</i> to return to the Known Worlds. When the <i>Andromeda</i> slipstreams to Tarazed, Dylan finds out that only four days have passed since the Battle of Arkology, and the Magog Worldship is crippled but still operational. Rhade reunites with his wife (only to return to the <i>Andromeda</i> shortly).</p>
<p><i>Andromeda</i> visits Earth (where Harper secretly plans to stay), but as soon as the ship arrives in the system, the planet is promptly destroyed by the Abyss. A huge Nietzschean fleet emerges from behind the debris, and <i>Andromeda</i> barely escapes.</p>
<p>Dylan begins to suspect Maura's motives and soon realizes she is not just another agent of the abyss, but THE avatar of the Abyss, and all of the Nebula were under its control. Maura had destroyed all Paradines (except Dylan). Trance annihilates Maura in a fight.</p>
<p>After a massive battle with Nietzscheans, Dylan checks the Methus Diagram once again and discovers that Trance's sun is capable of destroying the Abyss. <i>Andromeda</i> returns to Seefra through the Route of Ages, followed by the Abyss. Trance manages to pull her sun closer and plunge it into the Abyss, burning it.</p>
<p>The Abyss is finally destroyed, and Dylan's battle is over. The Route of Ages transforms into a slipstream portal, allowing the Commonwealth fleet to return to Tarn-Vedra.</p>
<p>This season was received poorly. Despite having an overall plot arc, it is often criticized as incoherent and almost turning into <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantasy.html" title="Fantasy">fantasy</a>, a sharp contrast to <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hard_SF_af18.html" title="Hard SF">hard SF</a> of seasons 1 and 2. The finale left many important questions unanswered (for example, what happened to the Worldship?). <i>Andromeda</i> fans are trying to address them in "virtual" seasons <a href="http://www.dromvirtualseason.homestead.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.dromvirtualseason.homestead.com/" rel="nofollow">6</a> and <a href="http://www.dromseason7.homestead.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.dromseason7.homestead.com/" rel="nofollow">7</a>.</p>

It was founded by <a href="../../../v/e/d/Vedrans.html" title="Vedrans">Vedrans</a>, the first race to discover slipstream, and lasted in peace for about 5500 years until the <a href="../../../n/i/e/Nietzschean_%28Andromeda%29_bb26.html" title="Nietzschean (Andromeda)">Nietzschean</a> revolt.</p>
<p>Dylan eventually managed to restore the Commonwealth (though not to its former glory; initially it had only 50 members while the Old Commonwealth had included more than a million worlds). However, the New Commonwealth soon fell victim to internal corruption masterminded by the group known as the Collectors, allied with the Abyss.</p>
