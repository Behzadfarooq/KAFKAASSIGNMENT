<p>Andrea first appeared on the <i><a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Stern_a7e1.html" title="Howard Stern">Howard Stern</a> Show</i> on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_22.html" title="January 22">January 22</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, when she was dubbed "The World's Dumbest Stripper." Howard asked her general knowledge questions and she got 2 out of 8 correct. In this appearance, Andrea also demonstrated her <a href="../../../t/a/b/Table_dance.html" title="Table dance">table dancing</a> skills for Howard.</p>
<p>Andrea was invited to <a href="../../../l/a/s/Las_Vegas%2C_Nevada_aec8.html" title="Las Vegas, Nevada">Las Vegas</a> where she won the title "Miss Howard Stern" in a contest on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_8.html" title="February 8">February 8</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> during the Howard Stern Show broadcast from the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hard_Rock_Hotel_and_Casino_41c6.html" title="Hard Rock Hotel and Casino">Hard Rock Hotel and Casino</a>.</p>

Andrea also revealed that she had a daughter when she was 16, saying her then-boyfriend used <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contraception.html" title="Contraception">protection</a> but that it didn't work. She said she became <a href="../../../d/e/p/Depression_%28mood%29.html" title="Depression (mood)">depressed</a> during the pregnancy, because she didn't want to get fat.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_17.html" title="October 17">October 17</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, Andrea was slated to play the "Smartest Stripper Contest" on the Howard Stern Show but never showed. <a href="../../../k/c/_/KC_Armstrong_a103.html" title="KC Armstrong">KC Armstrong</a>, then-Stern Show producer, said that she was out drinking until 5 in the morning.</p>

Her leg was in a cast - she said she kept hurting her feet and toes running into things. She also said she was on <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antidepressants.html" title="Antidepressants">antidepressants</a>, which had greatly intensified the effects of the alcohol she had drunk the Friday before at <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scores.html" title="Scores">Scores</a>.</p>

Andrea talked to Howard about the horrible <a href="../../../h/e/a/Headaches.html" title="Headaches">headaches</a> she has had for the past two years. Andrea said that she doesn't like dancing anymore and that she wants to be an <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actress.html" title="Actress">actress</a>.

On the show, she said that she had guessed at many of the answers; <a href="../../../k/c/_/KC_Armstrong_a103.html" title="KC Armstrong">KC Armstrong</a> said that she didn't provide any answer for 20 of the questions. She received a score of 88. Howard said that he had heard that Andrea had a <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crush.html" title="Crush">crush</a> on someone but she wouldn't say who it was. The other Stern Show staff members thought it was KC, but Andrea was too embarrassed to say. Howard told KC to ask Andrea out on a date, but KC declined, further fueling speculation among the cast that KC was <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay.html" title="Gay">gay</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_17.html" title="March 17">March 17</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, Andrea appeared on the <i>Howard Stern Show</i> and competed in a general knowledge quiz against <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evan_Marriott_d31d.html" title="Evan Marriott">Evan Marriott</a> from the TV show <i><a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Millionaire_6517.html" title="Joe Millionaire">Joe Millionaire</a></i>. Andrea lost. Howard then further probed Andrea about her crush on KC. Howard tried to get KC and Andrea to go out together, but neither agreed.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_2004.html" title="May 2004">May 2004</a>, Andrea appeared at the <i>Howard Stern Show</i> broadcast from the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hard_Rock_Hotel_and_Casino_41c6.html" title="Hard Rock Hotel and Casino">Hard Rock Hotel and Casino</a> in <a href="../../../l/a/s/Las_Vegas_bf20.html" title="Las Vegas">Las Vegas</a>. Andrea said that she was on a <a href="../../../d/i/e/Dieting.html" title="Dieting">diet</a> and taking <a href="../../../t/r/i/TrimSpa_77af.html" title="TrimSpa">TrimSpa</a>. As part of the Vegas special, Andrea sat in one of the squares in the <i>HollyWEIRD Squares</i> game on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_12.html" title="May 12">May 12</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>. Howard asked Andrea why she was crying during the break, but she denied that anything was wrong. (Later, she said she was sad because KC wasn't there in Vegas for the Stern show.) Howard asked Andrea to spell '<a href="../../../i/m/b/Imbecile.html" title="Imbecile">imbecile</a>' - she spelled it 'IMBESOLE'. On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_14.html" title="May 14">May 14</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, again as part of the Vegas special, Andrea competed against fellow Wack Packer <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beetlejuice_%28entertainer%29.html" title="Beetlejuice (entertainer)">Beetlejuice</a> in a general knowledge quiz for a chance to win $2,000. Andrea lost, but she was given a $1,000 <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casino_chip.html" title="Casino chip">casino chip</a>.</p>

She also had <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plastic_surgery.html" title="Plastic surgery">lip injections</a>. Howard and <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Quivers_dbf5.html" title="Robin Quivers">Robin</a> didn't like her new teeth, but Andrea said they make her feel more confident. <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Dell%27Abate_6062.html" title="Gary Dell'Abate">Gary</a> said that Andrea seems to have an unlimited amount of money but he's not sure where it comes from - he had seen her genuine <a href="../../../g/u/c/Gucci.html" title="Gucci">Gucci</a> <a href="../../../l/u/g/Luggage.html" title="Luggage">luggage</a> in the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_room.html" title="Green room">green room</a>.

Zolar also said that Andrea slept with a guy in Vegas with the name KC (not <a href="../../../k/c/_/KC_Armstrong_a103.html" title="KC Armstrong">KC Armstrong</a>). Zolar also said that Andrea's husband is a <i><a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">nigger</a></i> because he doesn't help pay for his kid. Andrea told Howard that her daughter is white, as the father of the child is half-<a href="../../../a/f/r/African-American_b405.html" title="African-American">black</a>.</p>

She also said she had gotten new <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breast_implants.html" title="Breast implants">breast implants</a> three weeks earlier, her second set of implants, and that they were almost <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bra_size.html#Bra_size_and_measurement" title="Bra size">Double Ds</a>. She also had her lips further injected. Howard told her that she should stop the plastic surgery. Howard asked Andrea about a 74-year-old man she's been dating. She said that he was just a friend but that he pays for things. Andrea had lost a lot of weight, she said because she hardly eats anything. Andrea said she found a job working at <a href="../../../h/o/o/Hooters.html" title="Hooters">Hooters</a> but got fired after one day for "causing too much attention". At Howard's request Andrea wore a <a href="../../../b/i/k/Bikini.html" title="Bikini">bikini</a> but wouldn't show her bare breasts. Howard then had Andrea don a <a href="../../../t/-/s/T-shirt.html" title="T-shirt">t-shirt</a> and remove her bikini top, after which Stern sidekick <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artie_Lange_fbc7.html" title="Artie Lange">Artie</a> used a <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_soaker.html" title="Super soaker">super soaker</a> water gun to soak her a la a <a href="../../../w/e/t/Wet_T-shirt_contest_36fc.html" title="Wet T-shirt contest">wet T-shirt contest</a>.</p>

During the interview, she revealed she had sex "eight or nine times" with former Stern staff member <a href="../../../k/c/_/KC_Armstrong_a103.html" title="KC Armstrong">KC Armstrong</a> over the course of a weekend and ceased the relationship after KC's ex-girlfriend discovered it. She also drank <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Daniel%27s_0199.html" title="Jack Daniel's">Jack Daniel's</a> whiskey during the interview, becoming noticeably drunk.

The staff found this particularly humorous given the fact that the father of Andrea's daughter is believed to be African American. <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artie_Lange_fbc7.html" title="Artie Lange">Artie Lange</a> suggested that Andrea would name her next child, <a href="../../../l/u/d/Ludacris.html" title="Ludacris">Ludacris</a> making reference to the African American rapper.</p>
