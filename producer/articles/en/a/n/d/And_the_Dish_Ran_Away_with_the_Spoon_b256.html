<p>Following on from the <a href="../../../s/o/m/Something_Borrowed%2C_Someone_Blue_%28Frasier%29_248c.html" title="Something Borrowed, Someone Blue (Frasier)">last episode</a>, the episode starts with Niles and Daphne, inside Martin's Winnebago, running from Daphne's wedding. Their giddy excitement is slightly ruined by the constant ringing of Niles' cellphone, both of them convincing that it must be someone from the wedding trying to chase them down. Reaching the end of the resort driveway, the two debate their options - fleeing to Seattle (and broken-hearted spouses and confusion - and excellent dining and a world class <a href="../../../o/p/e/Opera.html" title="Opera">opera</a>, as Niles points out) or <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> (representing a fresh start - although, as Niles fears, one with <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grizzly_bears.html" title="Grizzly bears">grizzly bears</a>). In trying to choose, however, both realise that they cannot run away from what they're doing, and bravely choose to go back and face the music. Reluctantly, Daphne confesses her feelings for Niles to Donny (causing him to faint, making the occasion doubly unfortunate, as Daphne chose to reveal this in the rock garden), and Niles breaks up with Mel (causing her to scream at the top of her lungs). The wedding cannot be called anything other than "the most disastrous wedding in history", in Frasier's words - nevertheless, during the uncomfortable drive home, Martin acknowledges that Niles and Daphne did the right thing in returning, and both thank Frasier for his help in getting them together.</p>
<p>The next day, Roz helps Daphne return the wedding gifts, and Simon (who is still making his unwelcome presence felt in Frasier's apartment) doesn't help by trying to steal them. When Niles comes over, both Niles and Daphne, although more intimate, are clearly slightly uncomfortable; Niles suggests that they need to take the relationship slowly and gently, without confusing things with sex, and Daphne agrees (much to Niles' disappointment). However, the course of true love isn't destined to run smoothly; when Niles receives a call from Mel, demanding that he see her, Daphne receives flowers from Donny - and a summons. Donny is suing her for emotional distress and breach of contract.</p>
<p>Against Martin's advice, Frasier goes to see Donny, who is holed up in his office, drugged on sedatives and consoling himself with his new friend 'Mr. Chump' (formerly the groom atop the wedding cake). Consoling Donny with their shared experience of being <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diane_Chambers_d7aa.html" title="Diane Chambers">abandoned at the altar</a> and betrayed by their brides, Frasier attempts to persuade Donny to drop the lawsuit against Daphne. Unfortunately, he inadvertently reveals his own 'minor' role in events - which only prompts Donny to add him to the lawsuit. Feeling much better, Donny bestows the title of 'Mr. Chump' on Frasier.</p>
<p>As Martin (repeatedly) points out to Frasier that he told him not to see Donny, Niles, meanwhile, is not faring much better; Mel, normally meticulously punctual, is late to their meeting, causing Niles to panic. When she does arrive, she is understandably cool towards her husband; however, her workmates having learnt of Mel marriage, she has no desire to be embarrassed by her husband 'running off with some <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cockney.html" title="Cockney">Cockney</a> <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tart.html" title="Tart">tart</a>' (i.e. Daphne) only four days into her marriage. (Incorrectly of course as Cockney refers to people from <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, while Daphne is from <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester.html" title="Manchester">Manchester</a>.) Mel agrees to grant Niles a divorce, but she has a list of demands; she will end the marriage, but only after what she deems a suitable a period of time. In the meantime, Niles will play the dutiful husband when they're in public, and Mel gives him a watch - which was to have been her wedding gift to him - for him to wear to represent this. Niles agrees to go along, but is less than thrilled to hear that their first social function will be their wedding reception, to be held that night</p>
<p><a name="Part_II" id="Part_II"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/And_the_Dish_Ran_Away_with_the_Spoon_b256.html" title="Edit section: Part II">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Part II</span></h3>
<p>Daphne, naturally, is less than pleased to hear about Niles and Mel's arrangement, but is persuaded that it will be a temporary measure. Niles' various attempts at pet-names don't help, and neither does Simon's revelation that he is still attempting to steal her wedding presents. Martin's tactless reminders to Niles about both his wedding reception and Mel's watch certainly don't improve matters, as it means that Niles must cancel a date the two had planned. Faced with only her brother's company and watching <i><a href="../../../b/r/a/Braveheart.html" title="Braveheart">Braveheart</a></i> in the Winnebago, Daphne quite reasonably bursts into tears.</p>
<p>The wedding reception proves greatly enjoyable for everyone except the 'happy' couple and Niles' relatives (and Roz, whose tale of woe involving the hunt for a dress, a sprained ankle and the 'check engine' signal in her car sees her head straight to the bar on arrival). Mel in particular isn't pleased to see Frasier, having heard from Donny about his 'minor involvement' in their recent unhappiness (which only prompts Martin to childishly point out that he told him so once more). Asking Frasier to make the toast, she is less than pleased with his heartfelt tribute to Niles and 'his true love' (obviously referring to Daphne), and takes a great amount of spiteful pleasure in pointing out to Niles that, under the terms of their arrangement, he cannot be seen in public with Daphne.</p>
<p>The next day, Daphne does not take this fresh news well, and Niles' reasonable tone and apparent justification of Mel's actions only sours her mood further, as it will means that a further dinner date the two had planned for that evening will no longer occur, and that she wasted money on a new dress for the date. Angrily, she rashly wishes she could reverse the last few days and thus avoid any of this, which hurts Niles' feelings. Frasier's attempts to mediate and avoid an argument only sees Niles and Daphne viciously turn on him, angrily blaming him for his interference and for ruining everything. Daphne storms to her room, and Niles, refusing to apologise to Frasier, is thrown out by his brother.</p>
<p>Genuinely hurt and furious by Niles and Daphne's words and ungraciousness, Frasier vents his <a href="../../../s/p/l/Spleen.html" title="Spleen">spleen</a> to Martin, who is preoccupied with making a <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandwich.html" title="Sandwich">sandwich</a>. Increasingly <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melodramatic.html" title="Melodramatic">melodramatic</a>, Frasier declares that he has washed his hands of Niles and Daphne's affairs, and will no longer interfere or intervene on their behalf - however, his dramatic proclamation that "this... is... <i>it</i>!" is blithely undercut by Martin, who will be in his room and available when Frasier thinks of a plan to get the two back together. As Frasier moodily tidies up the kitchen after him, Daphne - who has returned from her bedroom - timidly attempts to initiate a conversation with him, before tearfully apologising; the recent strain of the last few days had finally caught up with her. Frasier is immediately accepting of Daphne's apology, and they reconcile, Frasier inviting Daphne out to dinner - after all, whilst it might not be possible for Niles and Daphne to be seen in public, there's nothing stopping two old friends from going to dinner. Daphne is initially reluctant, but on realizing that her only alternative is spending yet more time with Simon, she agrees.</p>
<p>Later that night, Niles picks up Martin, the two intending to go to the Museum of Natural History. As Martin cheerfully discusses <a href="../../../p/y/g/Pygmies.html" title="Pygmies">pygmies</a>, Niles reveals that he too regrets the bitter argument earlier, and fears that he has ruined everything with Daphne. Fortunately, however, Martin has pressed the 'wrong' button on the elevator...</p>
<p>The two step out onto the roof, revealing a romantic table for two - and Daphne, radiant in her new dress. Rather than taking Daphne out, Frasier realised that if the two couldn't go out to dinner, then Frasier and Martin would bring the dinner to them, courtesy of the caterers of an elegant restaurant; and if the couple couldn't dance in a starlight ballroom, then Frasier would see to it that they could dance under the real thing. As Frasier genially accepts Niles' apology for the argument earlier, Frasier and Martin leave Niles and Daphne to their first date. It may not be what they expected, but the two are nevertheless happy as they dance together under the stars.</p>
