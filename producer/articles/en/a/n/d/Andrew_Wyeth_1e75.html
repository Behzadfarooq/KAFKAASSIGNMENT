<p>Andrew Wyeth is the son of <a href="../../../n/2E/c/N.C._Wyeth_289a.html" title="N.C. Wyeth">N.C. Wyeth</a>, a famous American illustrator and artist. He was born <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_12.html" title="July 12">July 12</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a> in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania. The youngest of five children, Andrew Wyeth was home-tutored and learned art from his father. In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1937.html" title="1937">1937</a> at age twenty, Wyeth had his first one-man exhibition of watercolors at Macbeth Gallery in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>. The entire inventory of paintings quickly sold out, and Wyeth's career was launched.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Wyeth_1e75.html" title="Edit section: Father's death / 1940s">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Father's death / 1940s</span></h2>
<p>In October 1945 Andrew Wyeth's father and his three-year-old nephew were killed when their car stalled on railroad tracks near their home and was struck by a train. Wyeth has referred to his father's death as a formative emotional event in his artistic career, in addition to a personal tragedy. It was shortly after this time that Wyeth's art consolidated into his mature and enduring style, characterized by a subdued color palette, highly realistic renderings, and the depiction of emotionally-charged symbolic objects.</p>
<p>In 1948 Wyeth began painting Anna and Karl Kuerner, neighbors of the Wyeths in Chadds Ford. Ironically the Kuerner's farm is just a few yards from where the rail road tracks that N.C. Wyeth died on, used to be. The Kuerner's farm is now available to tour through the Brandywine River Museum. Like the Olsons in Maine, the Kuerners and their farm became one of Wyeth's most important subjects for nearly 30 years.</p>

<p>Dividing his time between Pennsylvania and Maine, Wyeth has maintained a relatively consistent realist painting style for over fifty years. He has tended to gravitate to several identifiable landscape subjects and models, to which he would return repeatedly over a period of decades. He typically creates dozens of studies on a subject in pencil or loosely brushed watercolor before executing a finished painting, either in watercolor, <a href="../../../d/r/y/Drybrush.html" title="Drybrush">drybrush</a> (a watercolor style in which the water is squeezed from the brush), or egg <a href="../../../t/e/m/Tempera.html" title="Tempera">tempera</a>. His works have fetched increasingly higher prices with his growing fame, and today Wyeth's major works can sell for in excess of one million dollars from private dealers and at auction.</p>

</div>
<p>Wyeth's art has long been controversial. As a <a href="../../../r/e/p/Representation_%28arts%29.html" title="Representation (arts)">representational</a> artist, Wyeth's paintings have sharply contrasted with the prevailing trend of <a href="../../../a/b/s/Abstract_art.html" title="Abstract art">abstraction</a> that gained currency in American art in the middle of the 20th century.</p>
<p>Museum exhibitions of Wyeth's work have set attendance records, but many art critics have derided his paintings. The most common criticisms are that Wyeth's art verges on illustration, and that his predominantly rural subject matter is heavily weighted with sentiment.</p>
<p>Admirers of Wyeth's art believe that his paintings, in addition to sometimes displaying overt beauty, contain strong emotional currents, symbolic content and underlying abstraction. Most observers of Wyeth's art agree that he is exceptionally skilled at handling the mediums of watercolor and egg tempera (which uses egg yolk as a medium). Except for early experimentations, Wyeth has avoided using traditional oil paints.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>A particularly controversial episode in Wyeth's career surrounded a body of work Wyeth painted of Helga Testorf, a model he met through the Kuerner family in Chadds Ford. Wyeth began painting Helga in 1971 and for nearly fifteen years she was one of Wyeth's most important models. Unlike his other subjects, however, Wyeth kept the vast majority of his Helga works a secret from everyone, including his wife Betsy.</p>
<p>He revealed the Helga pictures to Betsy in 1985, and arranged a sale of the paintings to Leonard Andrews, a private investor, the following year. Andrews arranged a publicity blitz that attracted major museums to exhibit the artwork. Enticed by the suggestion of a secret love affair between Wyeth and Helga, national news media featured the story of Wyeth's secret cache of art.</p>
<p>Following the museum exhibitions, Andrews sold the works to an anonymous Japanese industrialist in 1990 reportedly for a substantial profit. Some curators felt that their museums were used to enhance the value of the art prior to the sale.</p>
<p>Some art critics thought that Wyeth and his wife had fabricated the entire story of the secret cache of paintings. Others simply admired the art. After the paintings' sale to the anonymous Japanese industrialist in 1990, the paintings were frequently exhibited at museums in the U.S. and Japan. The paintings were resold in early December, 2005 to an American buyer, who may break the collection up for individual sale.</p>
