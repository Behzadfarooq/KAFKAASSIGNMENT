<dd>Agree with Crestville - "slang", to my mind, is more about words which don't otherwise feature in the language - Al-i-fax may be a colloquial pronunciation, but it's hardly a new word.</dd>

<p>I put it there becuase on every article, it is desireable to start with the title word in the first couple of words, for example, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> article starts with "<b>The Beatles</b> were..." and the <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_act.html" title="Double act">Double act</a> article starts with "A <b>Double act</b> is..." when it would be just as correct to put "A <b>Comedy paring</b> is...." or "Comedians are paired for comedic purposes because....". If you think this should be an exception to the rule then by all means change it, but I'm not sure why.</p>
<p>As for the "chimp" and "rod" statements, not my finest hour. That was back when I was a bit more of a litte wiki-scallywag (BTW, I've just realised, Scallywag is a GREAT Yorkshireism).--<a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECrestville_26d9.html" title="User:Crestville">Crestville</a> 12:14, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

Yorkshireisms isn't a word in the dictionary but that just means we can't use it as the title. So long as we imply that it is a word used more commonly that the offical word (YC) we can use it. It's like Paul McCartney. That's not his real name, but it's ok to call him that because it's what we all know him as.--<a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECrestville_26d9.html" title="User:Crestville">Crestville</a> 12:37, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wikipedia being a cooperative effort isn't an excuse for people to blatantly ignore a growing consensus among more experienced editors that trivia sections are a sign of poor writing and of minimal encyclopedic value (if they have any value at all). Considering we have removed trivia sections from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> time and time again, you can't blame some of us for being "frustrated" if we have to repeatedly explain why this is wrong time and time again. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 15:56, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is no strict hierarchy, correct, but Wikipedia is not egalitarian either. Listening to what experienced editors have to say is generally a good thing, especially if they agree very strongly about it. Editing Wikipedia is not as simple as writing, contrary to common belief. You have to understand that Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>, which trivia sections violate. Some of us enjoy reading liner notes. Some of us enjoy reading the texts of political speeches. Neither belong in an encyclopaedia. And if you can't see why a bullet-point list is stylistically (for an encyclopaedia) inferior to prose, then it is a clear indicator you haven't spent enough time around. Lists of any kind in articles are widely considered to be a sign that the articles need improvement in writing. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 16:16, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just about almost everyone who has commented on <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">FAC</a> and the sort. "Too many lists, not enough prose" is a common reason for rejecting nominations, and for nominations to defeature existing FAs. (See <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_removal_candidates_Windows_XP_archive1_2e0a.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article removal candidates/Windows XP/archive1">Wikipedia:Featured article removal candidates/Windows XP/archive1</a> for just one example.) Lists are bad, and trivia lists even more so. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 16:59, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure where you got any of those quotes from, but I can't recall saying any of them recently. Perhaps a specific context would be of aid here, as I simply cannot recall <i>ever</i> saying "where I tend to stir up trouble for fun" in my life (except in jest, of course). <i>The only reason I started writing for Wikipedia was because of its openess, and seemingly good sense of fair play.</i> Fair play means abiding by our policies and consensus, not the freedom to do whatever you like. <i>I now have the distinct feeling that "we" seems to be some kind of hidden club that decides on most things. ItÂ´s - scarily - a little like the idea of the "Thought Police". The "concensus" seems to be what "we" think, whoever "we" are. Can we join the concensus? To whom do we apply?</i> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">Wikipedia:Consensus</a>. Consensus is shaped by the community - that's what we mean by "openness". However, nobody can simply come along and overturn longstanding consensus, <i>especially</i> if that someone is new to Wikipedia. (If anyone informed you that Wikipedia is egalitarian, they're wrong. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a democracy</a>.) You have the idea of people working together down pat. However, what this means is that you have to respect consensus. You are free to disagree, and certainly, we do not believe in a <a href="../../../t/y/r/Tyranny_of_the_majority.html" title="Tyranny of the majority">tyranny of the majority</a>. However, in the end, what is done is determined by what is best for the encyclopaedia, and not what people want to be done. It's as simple as that. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 11:10, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There's a consensus of users who have contributed their time and mind to The Beatles page who disagree with Johnleemk's ideals and views. We have put a lot into that page, building and maintaining it. Far be it from me to "lead a rebellion" - I have no intention of doing anything so lame - but really, the hard-bitten dogsbodies get the final say on this one. It's going to stay (too many articles have trivia sections to sway us) so you may as well resign to it..--<a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECrestville_26d9.html" title="User:Crestville">Crestville</a> 19:19, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I say it stays, Kingboyk says it stays, Less vanU says it stays, DavidWBrookes says it stays, James F says it stays, you say it stays - that's consensus enough for me. Johnleemk - good man though he is - is fighting against the current. We made the article, we decide what becomes of it. There's only so much he can do. If he wants to get rid of Beatles trivia, then he can gpo through every other article - stubs, minor articles, <a href="../../../a/d/e/Ade_Edmondson_d220.html" title="Ade Edmondson">The Genius Ade Edmondson</a> - and get rid of their trivia first. There;s a lot of ace info in them and he will have trouble incorperating/loosing it all. More importantly, don't let him put you off just because your "new". There's alot of "newbie bashing" on wikipedia - most of it justified, but not against you. Johnleemk is not a bad culprit. I like him, but he shouldn't have tried to use that against you. You have picked this up very quickly, unlike me - I took ages (just look at my talk page! It could still be argued I'm not quite there yet!) and frankly, your probably a better all-round user than me - you're polite, friendly, courtious, efficient, well informed and frankly, a pleasure to work with. Keep up the good work. If you even need a hand, come to me. I'm not an admin, but I'm a gobby little fucker and will argue your case 'till deaths door.

<dd>I restored the section below as I left a comment about it at the AfD. I think you were acting in good faith, but telling lots of other people about an AfD or any other consensus discussion is sometimes a bad idea. The reason is that editors in any given subject area tend to have an attachment to the subject of articles they work on, so the result may represent a lop-sided consensus. To me, that's not being "completely neutral". If you need more participants to get consensus for, say, a proposed policy or guideline, listing it on the <a href="../../../v/p/_/WP%7EVP_dc2f.html" title="WP:VP">village pump</a> or another widely-viewed page is the way to go. But AfD's generally aren't advertised. It shouldn't be a terribly big deal. You didn't know and you made a mistake. Now you know.

<p>Dear Beatles editors, I have just seen a header that âThe Beatles triviaâ is being considered for deletion. I would like you to take a look at it and vote to keep, or delete. The consensus will win the day. I will not vote, as I have been personally involved in the construction of the page. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasegde_c4ec.html" title="User:Andreasegde">andreasegde</a> 02:01, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

Well, the faeces has hit the fan. I now think that Kingboyk was right about changing the name of the article, because the word <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trivia.html" title="Trivia">trivia</a> seems to upset a lot of people. IÂ´m really sorry that this is so. There is even a Wikipedia article called <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trivia.html" title="Trivia">trivia</a> which deals with the subject, and has lots of bullet point lists, as well as linking to plenty of other pages that have <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trivia.html" title="Trivia">trivia</a> pages, so I am deeply confused as to why this page should be singled out.</p>
<p>I can only sit on my hands and wait until it is decided upon. ItÂ´s a bit like sitting in a dentistÂ´s waiting room... <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasegde_c4ec.html" title="User:Andreasegde">andreasegde</a> 07:30, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd just like to say that I didn't single anything out. I'm sure there are lots of other trivia articles about - I just chanced across this one. Just because similar articles exist does not provide a reason that any of them should exist. Trivia, whether called trivia or something else, is simply not something that an encyclopaedia is supposed to provide. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 14:39, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The Wikipedia page about the subject <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trivia.html" title="Trivia">trivia</a>, which has a List of trivia lists has been going from around May in 2005. 90% of The Beatles trivia page (apart from the one article that was already there) has been going for one month. Of course, I am biased, but it seems unduly harsh when an article has just started to get off the ground. Why was The Beatles trivia page not deleted when it first started? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasegde_c4ec.html" title="User:Andreasegde">andreasegde</a> 17:29, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, there's something like 1000 articles created every day, and it's unfortunately impossible for the amount of editors there are to even remotely keep close tabs on what's appearing. I'm sorry you feel it's unduly harsh for 'your' article to have been nominated. Don't know if it will make you feel any better but I do intend to nominate other trivia articles for deletion, when I find them. I certainly very strongly object to 'trivia' lists, let alone a list of them. I really would say your second paragraph of the beatles trivia page is a clear acknowledgement that what's in there is not encyclopaedic. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 23:19, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Do not take AfD's personally. I hope that you do voice your opinion with a <b>Keep</b> (if I'm interpreting your comments correctly). Some closing admins merely count Keeps &amp; Deletes and try to get to 75% or keep by "no consensus". Also, I would suggest renaming the article based on the majority of its contents to: Cultural references to The Beatles by later entertainers, or some such thing. I think there's precedent for such articles. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 00:36, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello! Just to let you know, the article on George Smith, John Lennon's uncle, who raised him as a son, is up for deletion. While I in no way wish for non-notable people to be given articles purely on the basis that they are related to someone famous, Smith was like a father to Lennon and integral but oftern overlooked key in The Beatles mythology (if that's the right word). He features prominantly in any other work on or about Lennon. Vital information that cannot reasonably be included in the Lennon article. The main problem is the unfortunate article title, which highlights close connotations to the fact that he is mainly famous for his relationship to Lennon. Other than that it is a desirable article for anyone wishing to learn about John Lennon. I just thought I'd give anyone interested the oppertuninty to voice their opinions here: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/George_Smith_%28John_Lennon%29â" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/George_Smith_%28John_Lennon%29â" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>].

<p>I was not attacking you. You chose to defend RPJ based on archived and edited entries on talk pages. You chose to jump into something and defend someone without having all the information. So I called RPJ your "hero", big deal, it was a joke. I never called you a conspiracy nut or any other. I just told you that the conversations have been edited to take out his personal attacks. FTR-- In deleted conversations, among the things RPJ has called editors are liars, jerks, phonies, and also was accused of anti-semitic attacks (I didn't see these attacks because another user edited them out).</p>
<p>Even though, RPJ and I have attacked each other, I still try to work with him. If another user, chooses a different route, who are you to blame them? You were offended because I referred to him as your hero, can you imagine how'd you feel if someone directly attacked your integrity?</p>

Hi, Ramsquire. My intentions were as you read them. If I had read the collection of insults that have been (supposedly) thrown around, I would have written something else. I can only go on what is presented, can I not? I would have thought one could archive insults and attacks, so as to have some form of defence in case of disagrement, and not delete them. Might be a good idea, huh?</p>
<p>Anyway; I have agreed with RPJ about a quote from LBJ, (see talk page) but I disagreed with him about a right-wing conspiracy piece. So there you go... now my hat is in the ring.</p>
<p>I do think RPJ has some valid points about people deleting stuff because they disagree with it. ItÂ´s not very Wiki, and the page is getting to be "IÂ´ll let you put your bit in if I can put mine in." Maybe we have to agree (good grief - is it possible?) about the basic rules and layout of the page. IÂ´d throw these in, for what they are worth:</p>
<p>1. No personal name-calling. 2. No theories without citations. 3. Both sides must be presented. 4. Take out "Response" and merge it into "One-shooter".</p>
<p>There you go, you can now kick me where it hurts (Ouch!) if thatÂ´s not sensible. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasegde_c4ec.html" title="User:Andreasegde">andreasegde</a> 15:30, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for the thanks, but other editors worked on bits of it, and I wouldnÂ´t like to claim the credit. I copied a lot of stuff from other pages, but I did put a comment at the end of the discussion that may have swung it to Keep. I paraphrase: "Think of a new user that has recently discovered The Beatles and wants to know more about them. They would find this page and be connected to lots of other articles that they would probably never find, even if they trawled through hundreds of pages. Go on, try it..." or something like that.

Hi, Richhoncho,</p>
<p>Do you think "Brent" would want the original quote to be in if he knew it to be wrong? Go on, ask him. Also: Do you think a page with that kind of grammar would escape the gaze of a steely-eyed wiki-man like yourself?&#160;:) (BTW, did you AfD it because of my correction?)

Would you change JFK's "I am a doughnut" quote because JFK got it wrong? No, of course not, changing the grammar in an article is good, but not the quotes.

<dd>Well, I thought that if Brent said it, heÂ´d want to change it. If the editor got it wrong, then heÂ´d not want to make Brent sound ungrammatical. Of course, I could say that I paraphrased it, so as to make it clearer. HowÂ´s about that?</dd>

<p>YouÂ´ll like this Richhoncho: Did you look at the history section of The Mad Man series? A certain "Brent65" contributed lots to it. I wonder who that is? (Doh!) Not only did he write the article (POV, of course) but he quoted <i>himself</i> , and did it badly. I think your AfD is a job well done. (I put a "delete" in as well, even though I corrected the quote - Doh!)

<dd>I know, that's one of the reasons I listed it for AfD. LOL. But, again it's one of the reasons you shouldn't change quotes without verification. In this case we can be fairly certain this is what "Brent" said. But more importantly, don't beat yourself up, we all make mistakes - as long as we learn by mistakes and the right concensus is reached no harm is done. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichhoncho_144b.html" title="User:Richhoncho">Richhoncho</a> 16:55, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for that link, I must have been signed to Schroeders by the same guy - who also signed Hendrix - and there lies a tale not fit for public consumption - people might think music publishers are really nice guys! The Elton John case is pretty typical of the music business, never do royalty audits and then scream they have been "ripped off." Without Dick James it's a disctinct possibility Mr. Dwight might now be an unknown piano bar player. Didn't he accuse John Reid of the same? If the EU gets its way, then these type of long-term contracts will become illegal anyway, at which point all the record cos and publishers will close up shop, or maximise the profit on old stuff, because there will be no returns on breaking new artists. As for the other sites you linked on my page I'd put them down as pure "PopTart" and not worth the time it took me to skim through.

<p>No, they are not equal. Rupert Merton - from the <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thompson_Twins_e16c.html" title="Thompson Twins">Thompson Twins</a> - was an extremely affable, very fair, and honest publisher, as I have read. I am sure there are lots more. I have nothing against fair publishers, but I do have something against musicians (weÂ´re agreeing about this now) who donÂ´t read contracts properly. Maybe we should be talking about their laywers, and advisors, and not about anyone else...

<p>1. I was referring to comments posted by RPJ. He has been blocked for them. I didn't type it directly to him, because I knew he was blocked, and felt that everyone could take a refresher in assuming good faith. You were not on my radar. As I said, if it was about you, I would have indented it from your comments or used your username. The comment was to all users, but in reference to RPJ's responses to Gamaliel.</p>
<p>2. You are being too sensitive. You posted "I feel insulted" when there was no insult in the post; and then you demand an apology. For what? Even if I was talking about you or to you, there'd be nothing to apologize for as I was simply giving my opinion. You are free to do so as well. I didn't accuse anyone of anything. I just asked that everyone (but specifically RPJ) give Gamaliel the benefit of the doubt before accusing him of incorrect behavior. Where's the attack? Where's the slight? Today, you clearly miss the wink&#160;;-) after "guilty conscience", because you believe you are being attacked, when I did all I could outside of calling you on the phone and telling you that the "Guilty conscience" comment was meant in jest. In any case, considering it was in jest, I don't see how you could find that demeaning. I am not accusing you of being paranoid. I'm telling you I think you are being highly sensitive. I don't play around with language. I state what I feel. I feel you are way too sensitive. I said it clearly in my post yesterday. I have stated it again.

<p>I see your point about the cquote template. It's not to everyone's liking but it has become fairly standard for long quotes in Wikipedia. See featured article <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Lincoln_11e8.html" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> for an example. As the template is written the color can't change though the quotes can be made smaller. I'm reluctant to change it because that's the standard size used in other articles and the Bruford quotes are quite long. A bigger problem with the article is the number and length of quotes. It reads more like an interview than an encyclopedia biography. It's borderline copyright violation. --<a href="../../../d/_/m/User%7ED_Monack_6280.html" title="User:D Monack">dm</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/_/m/User_talk%7ED_Monack_f4c7.html" title="User talk:D Monack">(<i>talk</i>)</a></sup> 17:00, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I saw your posts as hostile but if there was no intent then we'll just cool it down and draw a clean slate. 'Think on' as I interpreted it means "Don't do it again". Half the place names are abbreviations, I don't see what's wrong with that. Abbreviating place names is a very Yorkshire thing to do. My suggestion would be to create a seperate sub section for them, names commonly abbreviated.<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGordyB_9ddb.html" title="User:GordyB">GordyB</a> 12:17, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Little danger of the article getting deleted. Look at <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_league_in_Kenya_203b.html" title="Rugby league in Kenya">Rugby league in Kenya</a>, the article basically states that rugby league was played a couple of times in Kenya; nobody was very interested and it probably isn't played there at all any more. The original author put it up for deletion but somehow it survived. Even porn films have articles and I don't mean just ones like "Debbie does Dallas" or "Deep throat" that people have actually heard of. Sometimes I think you could write an article on a crisp packet you found under your sofa and it would survive a vote for deletion. The most likely event is that it will get merged into the <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorkshire_dialect.html" title="Yorkshire dialect">Yorkshire dialect</a> article.<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGordyB_9ddb.html" title="User:GordyB">GordyB</a> 20:00, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As I've stated before, I've assumed you are not an American because of your spelling of certain words and also due to your writing style. I don't know if you know this, but in the US, due to political correctness, the phrase "Chiefs and Indians" is no longer in widespread use. I believe that most people who read your post will know what you mean though. But some do find offense in both of the terms "Chiefs" and "Indians" when referring to "Native" or "Indigenous" Americans. (I know you weren't referring to them or meant any offense, but I'd just thought I'd let you know about that, if you didn't know already). <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamsquire_2238.html" title="User:Ramsquire">Ramsquire</a> 17:03, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The oft-written comment that it should be split up into sections (north, south etc.)</li>
<li>The certainty that editors will constantly come along and âlobâ words in willy-nilly.</li>
<li>Vandals.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you wish to proceed, I wish you all the best, but it seems all uphill to me. Best of luck. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasegde_c4ec.html" title="User:Andreasegde">andreasegde</a> 05:33, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It will take a long time but it is do-able. Every article gets vandalised and gets inappropriate edits - no difference really.</dd>
<dd>Splitting the section into dialect areas is not practical, most 'Leeds dialect' words would probably also be 'York dialect' words. North Yorkshire is too vast an area to call one dialect area: Skipton is a long way from Whitby, it may even be closer to Sheffield. In any case labelling different dialect areas would largely be original research unless based on something. What I will do is use articles on different regionalised accents e.g. North Yorks (would be better split into Dales / Moors / York / Yorkshire Coast), Cleveland (the Yorkshire bit), East Riding, West Yorks, South Yorks etc and reference each vocab item as to which article names it e.g. 'tyke' might well be referenced by every article whereas 'mardy' might get referenced only by articles on North or South Yorkshire dialects.<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGordyB_9ddb.html" title="User:GordyB">GordyB</a> 15:02, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree. I took it out. The reference should be given where he said that. Even if he did say it, I donÂ´t think it belongs in there. It keeps popping back into the article after I remove it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, I donÂ´t know you who you are, but I agree. He did say it, and maybe there should be a section about some of the nasty comments and things he did (which are true) to balance the article out.

<dd>I think that if there was a section - which nobody in the whole world has at the moment (about Johnny and his nasty bits) it would balance the whole article out. It doesnÂ´t have to be Albert Goldmann style, but just something that shows his other side. I once read where he said, "Oh, in Greenwich village, where all those Wanna-bees live, yÂ´know?", which opened my eyes a bit. He was not a saint - he was a human being - as he frequently said. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasegde_c4ec.html" title="User:Andreasegde">andreasegde</a> 17:06, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. Er.... Are you able to pop over and add some "information" into a newsletter that only requires some news to make it viable? If you don't fancy editing it, then just a few suggestions on the talk page will suffice. I've not been around the project much so don't know too much about current events.

<dd>I'm poor at getting directions right, but if you go to your last Newsletter there is a link in the editors column for the next(current) edition.
