	    <p>Just to say, I take issue with the following quote: " For example in the line "And was Jerusalem builded here", the stress should almost certainly be on the word "here", and not on "builded", as the music demands. Likewise in the penultimate line, the stress should be on "have", as only this makes any sense of the words. "</p>
<p>The stress is in fact on "here", and not "builded" (which is on the (weak) off-beat) - the second example is good though.</p>

<p>It's a misconception -albeit a popular one- that Blake's poem is patriotic. The poem is a condemnation of the first industrialists who spoil the English countryside with their "dark satanic mills". The swords and arrows of the poem are being raised to save nature -God's work, according to Blake - from man's interventions and build an ideal society there, a new Jerusalem. Remember the fight is "mental", not physical, and not intended to subjugate other countries or expand England's territory. Utopic, yes, patriotic, I don't think so. Maybe it is perceived as such because it is always sung alongside "Rule Brittannia" and "Land of hope and glory", two VERY patriotic songs, during events like the last night of the Proms? Written by Inge (inge.s@skynet.be)</p>
<dl>
<dd>To this I'll add that, in near-total ignorance of the long poem that this hymn introduces, I too have always assumed that this text isn't patriotic at all. I was surprised to read that Blake's biographers say he bought this thing about Christ in England: I've always assumed that Blake is saying "Dude, England is nice and all, but is it the Holy Land? Is this where God chose to send his son? I don't think so! It's closed-minded and complacent to assume that our own little world of things-the-way-they-are is God's kingdom, not unless we do the work of making it so." (Hence the hymn's initial use in a suffragist context.)Iralith 16:29, 25 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For what it's worth, I don't see any obvious contradiction between "anti-industralist/pro-Nature" and "patriotic".

<dd>I'd say, go ahead -- the stonehenge theory exists, but it's only one, and very much a minority one.</dd>
<dd><i>Blake seemed to have a slightly different concept for mill in his various longer works. None of these suggest usage in the context of monolithic circles - that doesn't mean he didn't have those in mind, just that the theory hasn't gained much popularity in Blake academic circles.</i> <a href="http://www.emule.com/2poetry/phorum/read.php?f=4&amp;i=26333&amp;t=26292" class="external text" title="http://www.emule.com/2poetry/phorum/read.php?f=4&amp;i=26333&amp;t=26292" rel="nofollow">source</a></dd>
<dd>The article should still make some attempt, though, to set out what people have thought Blake meant by "Satanic mills", as that is one of the main talking points that always comes up when the poem is being discussed. -- <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPicapica_4069.html" title="User:Picapica">Picapica</a> 10:38, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Another interpretation is that Blake was not refering directly to the Mills and the industrial revolution, but in fact was refering to a cotton mill near his home which had burnt down. It is thought he would have passed this burnt, chared, "Dark [and] Satanic" mill every day. Thus, it is thought that it could refer to what this mill represented- the dangers of the modern age- rather than the Industrial revolution specificaly.</p>

<p>I removed the references to "covering" Jerusalem and changed them to "performing".

<p>I see this has been discussed above, but the article still says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The reference to "dark Satanic mills", is sometimes interpreted, not as a reference to steel or textile mills, but a satirical reference to Neolithic monuments such as Stonehenge, which Blake thought were Satanic. Other interpretations are that the line was a coded jibe at either the established Church or the (then) theologically dominated universities at Oxford and Cambridge."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Could we have some <b>evidence</b> that Blake meant "dark Satanic mills" to refer to anything other than the most obvious meaning, the textile mills of industrial England, which Blake detested?

<dl>
<dd>It appears to be the opinion of 'CheeseDreams', whose edit of 01:26, 20 November 2004 states, "Thus the use of the word "mill" as in mill stone and round things". I agree that some evidence would be welcome as it seems highly unlikely. --<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoss_UK_3c09.html" title="User:Ross UK">Ross UK</a> 23:49, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I am going to delete it. I don't think Blake was into either sarcasm or coded messages. He said what he meant, and "dark satanic mills" should be taken as meaning what it appears to mean unless there is firm evidence to the contrary. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 00:17, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>In Gertrude Himmelfarb's "The Idea of Poverty", there's a footnote after a usage of the phrase that says: "Blake's 'dark Satanic Mills' is generally taken to be a condemnation of the cotton factories. In the preface to Milton, where the phrase appears, it refers to the universities and intellectual establishments which worshipped the false gods of Homer and Ovid, Plato and Cicero, instead of the Bible, Shakespeare and Milton. The image of the mill, here and in his other poems, derives not from the cotton mill but from the iron and steel mills producing the weapons of war. It was militarism more than industrialism that exercised Blake." She gives no convincing reasoning for that theory, but at least it's an instance of a high-level academic espousing it. User:2005 213.107.107.9</p>
<p>She actually gives two contradictory theories: does it refer to the universities, or to iron mills? It can't mean both. And I don't think it's true that "militarism more than industrialism that exercised Blake." <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 19:59, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It could refer to both, in a sense akin to that in which people speak of "the Military-Industrial Complex". We might assume that Blake was protesting against the post-Industrial-Revolution culture, changing away from Nature, agriculture, and spirituality, toward an emphasis on producing machine-minded men to work in machine-minded places. -- 26 december 2005</dd>

<p>Is it really safe to regard the following statement as neutral?</p>
<pre>
 <i>"after all, the first verse is a series of questions to which the 'truthful' answer is no,"</i>
</pre>
<p>The legend behind this poem seems to fall in the grey area between mainstream modern-day religions (whose claims cannot be assumed to be true or false in a neutral article), and ancient religions which are almost universally regarded as mythical. The article states that Blake, writing about 200 years ago, believed in the legend. Do we really have to right to state categorically that he was wrong, without loss of neutrality? Or should we change the article's wording to say something like <i>"...a series of questions to which most people today (whether Christian or otherwise) would answer 'no' "</i>?</p>
<p><br />
Maybe this is pedantic - but there might still be people who would answer "yes" to the questions in the first verse (after all, the Book of Mormon is still very much alive, with its account of Jesus visiting North America!). Mtford 12:14, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I recently found an MP3 of a song called 'Jerusalem' by Vera Lynn. It doesn't fit the description of any of the songs and I wondered if anyone could confirm it is indeed Vera singing it and find out the complete lyrics. The sound is reminiscent of a church hymn via '40s MGM symphony orchestrations.</p>
<p>From listening to the track, the opening verse and chorus are:-</p>
<ul>
<li>'Last night I lay asleeping, there came a dream so fair;</li>
<li>I stood in old Jerusalem, beside the temple (bare/there)/</li>
<li>I heard the children singing, and ever as they sang,</li>
<li>Methought the voice of angels in heaven, in us, rang.</li>
<li>Methought the voice of angels in heaven, in us, rang.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Jerusalem, Jerusalem,</li>
<li>Lift up your gates and sing</li>
<li>"Hosanah" (spelling uncertain) in the highest,</li>
<li>"Hosanah" to your king.'</li>
</ul>
<p>This is "The Holy City" of 1892 vintage y Stephen Adams and Frederick Weatherly. This song is also commonly called "Jerusalem".</p>
<p>And yes, I do believe that Vera Lynn released a version.</p>
<p>I don't think this is the place for that. If Blake's original wording was "strife" and not "fight," ought the text of the poem in the article reflect that, and that reference be removed?

<p>I second that 'strife/fight', I think people sing a mixture. I also always thought it was 'Now shall my sword sleep in my hand', indicating it never leaves, but I imagine someone has sourced this text from somewhere official. <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkittle_f631.html" title="User:Skittle">Skittle</a> 13:14, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>support</b> I have never in my life seen this hymn referred to as anything other that "Jerusalem", the title that Blake gave it. It should be found under its proper title. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangoe_79f9.html" title="User:Mangoe">Mangoe</a> 17:55, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Blake didn't call his poem <i>Jerusalem</i> (though he did write <a href="../../../t/h/e/Jerusalem%7E_The_Emanation_of_the_Giant_Albion_991f.html" title="Jerusalem: The Emanation of the Giant Albion">something else by that name</a>), and it wasn't made into a hymn until long after he died. (The hymn is called <i>Jerusalem</i>, of course.) --<a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZundark_7566.html" title="User:Zundark">Zundark</a> 19:52, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I have <b>withdrawn</b> this request after further consideration. Though the title "Jerusalem" is familiar, it is arguable to keep it listed under the first line. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangoe_79f9.html" title="User:Mangoe">Mangoe</a> 19:02, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Does anyone remember, or have any details of, the Spitting Image parody of this song?
