<p>Looks great! Remember that you should always <b><a href="../../../b/b/_/WP%7EBB_678a.html" title="WP:BB">be bold when updating pages</a></b>.

<dd>Only just seen this - good stuff: it is nice to see some tax professionals contributing. You may like to add a link to it at <a href="../../../t/a/x/Taxation_in_the_United_Kingdom_2320.html" title="Taxation in the United Kingdom">Taxation in the United Kingdom</a>, and expand the summary paragraph there ion IHT. There should probably also be a short summary paragraph at <a href="../../../i/n/h/Inheritance_tax.html" title="Inheritance tax">Inheritance tax</a>, which is <i>meant</i> to cover all jurisdictions, not just the US as it does at present. Finally, query whether it should be moved to United Kingdom inheritance tax, like <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_corporation_tax_fffb.html" title="United Kingdom corporation tax">United Kingdom corporation tax</a>. But, once again, well done. -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 12:34, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think a link to Trust (Law) USA, should be in the disambiguation page Trust (I don't know if it is right now), and then from there a link to the current Blind trust page, which I think is more of a stub right now. Go ahead with the change you think fits better, I'm sure you are better qualified for doing this since you are a lawyer. I'm just a computer programmer.

<p>thanks for starting this article. I removed the following text from the top of the article:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>I am in the process of writing this page. I am saving it in small blocks to the internet as I go. If you are seeing this message you are looking at an intermediate version of the article. (If you are seeing this message after, say, 3 October 2005, I have died, or got bored, or something and you should remove it.)</b> <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyJones_d8f9.html" title="User:AndyJones">AndyJones</a> 20:11, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The reason being <b>articles</b> aren't supposed to contain anything but encyclopedic information - you can post messages mentioning the status of the article on the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Wikipedia%7ETalk_page_a6d3.html" title="Wikipedia:Talk page">talk page</a> but the idea with articles is to pretend wikipedia is a real encyclopedia - just as you wouldn't find notes in Brittanica saying "I haven't finished this section yet!", you shouldn't be able to find them in wikipedia. Of course my analogy is a bit odd, because you wouldn't find incomplete articles in Brittanica anyway, but the policy with wikipedia is that even the pages that aren't yet nearly finished shouldn't lapse from an encylopedic tone or <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_self_reference_bdbd.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid self reference">refer to themselves</a>. After all, <i>all</i> articles here are works-in-progress.</p>

<p>Hi AndyJones. Just a quick word with regard to the Paul Mooney (blooger) thing. I hadn't realised that there was already a discussion going on on the matter. I was using CryptoDerk's vandal fighter and saw it come up. I took one look at it and thought "nonsense!". I'll try to be a bit more thorough in my investigations before marking as Afd in the future. So, thanks for setting me straight on the matter! Much appreciated! <a href="../../../k/c/2E/User%7EKC._d9d2.html" title="User:KC.">KC.</a> 17:58, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Andy, when I say "collapse [[foo|foo]]", I mean that I take any wiki link where the description part and the article to link to are the same, and remove the redundant description part. So [[Buffy the vampire slayer|Buffy the vampire slayer]] is redundant, it can be replaced by [[Buffy the vampire slayer]]. Foo is a <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metasyntactic_variable.html" title="Metasyntactic variable">metasyntactic variable</a> commonly used in programming.

<p>All right, I understand what you're saying, but I still think a speedy could have worked better. Now you have to wait a week before things can progress, but if it was speedied you could report the guy for vandalism as soon as he tried to touch the Paul Mooney the comedian article. In any case, it doesn't really matter now, you've got the consensus already and I hope you won't have to waste any more time on that blogger guy. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlyboy_Will_540f.html" title="User:Flyboy Will">Flyboy Will</a> 19:53, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>AndyJones,</p>
<p>It saddens me that you would find it more appropriate to delete a link to annother free info database because it has been denied public documents (judgments) by the <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incorporated_Council_of_Law_Reporting_ef72.html" title="Incorporated Council of Law Reporting">Incorporated Council of Law Reporting</a>, rather than write to the Council and use your efforts to have them release the copyright. <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au" class="external text" title="http://www.austlii.edu.au" rel="nofollow">AustLII</a> had similar problems until enough people supported it - indeed even Wikipedia was limited to start with. Is it not time to send people to the site so that they can complain that the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_law.html" title="Common law">common law</a> of England is copyrighted to the Incorp council of law reporting who (with your favoured commercial link sites) will charge them a fee if they want to know the law (which, of course, they are presumed to know).</p>
<p>But, it is not for an Australian lawyer to emancipate the Brits. I leave it for you to restore the <a href="http://www.bailii.org" class="external text" title="http://www.bailii.org" rel="nofollow">BAILII</a> link, unless you think that we should all be denied awareness of the free access legal database of the UK because it is presently crippled by the Incorp Council.</p>

<p>I think it is anachronistic and (which is worse) misleading to describe the lands between the Irish Sea and the North Sea, excluding Scotland, as "Britain". I suspect the medievals would agree since (if I remember my Malory correctly) they tended to distinguish between Britain the Less (Brittany) and Britain the Great. I'm not very well read in this area but it sounds wrong to me. Can you provide any contemporary source that describes this stretch of land as "Britain"? Then again, you must do as you think right. I am dealing with enough articles not to want to get involved in another. The reason we Englanders know we're top nation in these isles is because Celts like yourself get so chippy about denying it&#160;;-) <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStroika_0612.html" title="User:Stroika">Stroika</a> 00:16, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Greetings! Since you are one of the three people who post frequently on the William Shakespeare talk page, I thought I would include you in this.</p>
<p>If you haven't noticed, I've been trying to push WikiProject Theatre a bit. Someone on the talk page noted that the project is really very large and I agree. So in order to break up some of the work and concentrate it, I have decided to break up WikiProject Theatre into a series of smaller theatre projects. The first of these is WikiProject Elizbethan theatre. This project, spanning the 84 years between the beginning of Elizabeth I's reign to 1642 when the Puritans closed the theatres, covers such names as Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe and Ben Jonson. It aims to expand Wikipedia's coverage of the Elizabethan theatre as well as bringing the articles up to a high level of quality (close to or attaining FA status).</p>
<p>This project has not actually been launched as an official project yet, but the 2 main pages have been created on subpages of WikiProject Theatre and can be viewed here. I would like to get some feedback and suggestions before I officially launch the project. Please feel free to become a member of the project if you'd like. Please leave any messages regarding this here and I will watch your page. Thanks! <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGanymead_e521.html" title="User:Ganymead"><i>*Exeunt*</i> Ganymead</a> | <a href="../../../g/a/n/User_talk%7EGanymead_5bcf.html" title="User talk:Ganymead">Dialogue?</a> 20:38, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A question: Does Pierre's argument that conventions used one language of the Encyclopedia can apply on another make sense?

<li>Someone will have to raise it. Pierre tells me that he can not navigate into the Village Pump because it is too complex for his reader. At the moment, I'm trying to think of what to write. If you have any suggestions I would be happy to consider them. -- <i><b><a href="../../../1/2/7/User%7E127.html" title="User:127"><font color="blue">127</font></a>.<a href="../../../1/2/7/User_talk%7E127.html" title="User talk:127"><font color="orange">*</font></a>.<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_127_2e7c.html" title="Special:Contributions/127"><font color="green">*</font></a>.<a href="../../../index.html" title="Main Page"><font color="red">1</font></a></b></i> 13:18, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is an interesting question. I shared a house with a blind guy about ten years ago, and he used the internet a great deal. Unfortunately we've lost touch, so I cannot ask for his guidance on this. I checked out the accessibility sections of a couple of websites in the UK: Here is <a href="http://www.rlsb.org.uk/accessibility.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.rlsb.org.uk/accessibility.htm" rel="nofollow">The Royal London Society for the Blind</a>, and here's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/newmedia/accessibility/" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/newmedia/accessibility/" rel="nofollow">the BBC</a>. I suppose they are starting points. I'll consider this issue some more. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyJones_d8f9.html" title="User:AndyJones">AndyJones</a> 16:17, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, I'm not sure I've made much of a job of it, but I've initiated a discussion here: <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28policy%29_070f.html#Accessibility_for_blind_users" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)">Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)#Accessibility for blind users</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyJones_d8f9.html" title="User:AndyJones">AndyJones</a> 20:09, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm getting a little tiured of this silliness; this individual obviously has listening &amp; comprehension problems, and a serious (though very strange) agenda. I would suggest if you know any admins, it's time this guy got blocked.<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBridesmill_4b81.html" title="User:Bridesmill">Bridesmill</a> 21:48, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Yes, he seems to have engaged in a bout of trollery on Friday evening shortly after my last edit. I really am losing patience with the guy and his constant ridiculous accusations and insults. If there's any more this week I will suggest that he be blocked on the administrators' notice board. He certainly does not play well with the other children. I see from his talk page that he was warned by User:127. I wouldn't say he took it in the right spirit, though. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyJones_d8f9.html" title="User:AndyJones">AndyJones</a> 20:35, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I think an admin needs to review the behaviour of <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPierreLarcin2_1721.html" title="User:PierreLarcin2">User:PierreLarcin2</a> and his IPs in relation to the edit war on <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotary_International_bc14.html" title="Rotary International">Rotary International</a>, and consider a block. Incidentally, since I started reviewing this, I see the user I'm complaining about has put in an RfC and claims to intend to start an arbitration. If true, I'd suggest that any block should permit him to pursue those, even if (as I'd recommend) he cannot edit at <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotary_International_bc14.html" title="Rotary International">Rotary International</a> for a time. A review of his behaviour took me far longer than I'd expected, but can be summarised as follows: POV editing: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rotary_International&amp;diff=36035764&amp;oldid=34707887" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rotary_International&amp;diff=36035764&amp;oldid=34707887" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rotary_International&amp;diff=39247837&amp;oldid=39201148" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rotary_International&amp;diff=39247837&amp;oldid=39201148" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rotary_International&amp;diff=39607655&amp;oldid=39607479" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rotary_International&amp;diff=39607655&amp;oldid=39607479" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rotary_International&amp;diff=49039426&amp;oldid=49000393" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rotary_International&amp;diff=49039426&amp;oldid=49000393" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rotary_International&amp;diff=59502395&amp;oldid=59488791" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rotary_International&amp;diff=59502395&amp;oldid=59488791" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>.

<dd>Well, thank you AndyJones. You certainly feeled that our arbitration request is ALSO concerning you...For your repetitive blanks on the facts I brought. Nice huge work you did on me. As you maybe saw upstairs&#160;: I did not ask blocking of pro-Rotarian users because the repeted blankings they do (only on "negative" aspects) and repeted request for fact sourcing (only on "negative" aspects- no such request on "positive" rotarian). Such a huge work just show that you are concerned by restriction in critic facts only to Rotary International in a wiki. See you at arbitration.</dd>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Thanks for your input. I noticed you are an attorney, hence your take on things. I would just like to point out the legal meaning of "rape" is narrower than the general meaning of the word. "Rape" existed before it was a crime. And different jurisdictions across the world define "rape" in vastly different terms.</p>
<p>I am not sure why the Wikipedian dictionary definition would be any better than one we can come up with ourselves. Before I provided my definition, I read the definitions given by the most authoritative dictionaries of the English language. The definition I gave was based on the best parts of these definitions. Moreover, encyclopedic entrys usually have space for more elaborate definitions. Hence, you find a more complete definition for the word "paradox" in Wikipedia than you find in your average dictionary.</p>
<p>Best regards, Michael</p>

<p>Hello, Andy. Thanks for the help-desk help on my query re the above. Can I take it that you'll do all the removing, or should I join in?</p>
<p>My original point was that I couldn't find out whether there were any wiki-guidelines on what to do when encountering this sort of thing, which is usually the work of - for obvious reasons - anonymous IP addresses. This cannot be the only example, and I wonder whether something ought to appear somewhere among the FAQs or wherever is appropriate? Any thoughts?

<p>KXL June 19, 2006: What exactly is "spammy" about listing Stewart's production (which took place years ago, and so is not an advert for it)? Other S. plays appear to have significant productions listed. I would say his is quite significant, since it's a unique twist. The link provided all sorts of details about that production -- which I would say is more legit than all the film versions.</p>

<p>I was thinking that being that he is probably the most famous (and brilliant) artist of all time, this should be mentioned in the first paragraph, rather than calling him merely a poet and playwright.

<p>I've responded to your point about <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_James_I_a4ea.html" title="King James I">King James I</a> on the relevant talk page. You are, of course, absolutely right: he was always James VI. He was never King of Great Britain in any legal or constitutional sense, and the only regnal number he ever had was 'VI'. He was never even known as James 'I' in England during his lifetime. As a general principle a monarch only acquires a regnal number when a successor comes along with the same name. King John has never be known as 'John I' for the simple reason that there has been no 'John II'. I've edited out the silly and unhistorical reference. <a href="../../../r/c/p/User%7ERcpaterson_27d2.html" title="User:Rcpaterson">Rcpaterson</a> 22:55, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm glad I was able to help in response to your query about capitalizing "states." Now that I see you are a UK editor (and fellow lawyer), I might suggest that you analogize "states" in the USA to "counties" in the UK to determine when a cap is appropriate. Would be glad to look at a sample of the sentence/article you were querying to see if any change is warranted in the capitalization practice, though what I said in the help should usually cover it.

As far as I know, using six words, exactly, from an outside article almost certainly falls within the "fair use" provision of copyright law. While "fair use" has never explicitly been defined in this area, I doubt there has ever been a successful lawsuit where (say) someone sued someone else for copying a string of a dozen words (and nothing else). <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> 12:23, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I 100% agree. Looking for an exact string on the internet is a way of searching for copyvios, though. Your problem was the opposite: you were using the absence of a match as evidence of OR, when of course - by itself - it is nothing of the sort. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyJones_d8f9.html" title="User:AndyJones">AndyJones</a> 12:49, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi. I can't help but notice that you spend lots of your (apparently prodigious) energy reverting jerks -- a thankless task enough, for which I thank you. (I guess you deserve a barnstar, but I've not yet figured out how to award such things!) You are one of the few serious folks concerned with Shakespeare (and signed on for that Elizabethan Theatre project), so I would like your opinion about some of my recent edits: in a desultory way I've gone after two or three of the plays, trying to supply decent references (ideally on line and authoritative, otherwise easy-to-find books) and cite the citable. I've also done some bigger things: I redid the "List of Characters" for <i>Hamlet</i>, <i>Twelfth Night</i>, and (partially so far) <i>Henry IV, Part 1</i>. What do you think? My thought was to standardize the section heading, and make the one-line character name prominent, any little essay being indented. As to the essays, my sense of things is that they should be meta-observations for the most part, and not dwell on plot points. (That is, give facts that are hard to pick out in the course of reading the play, or that help at its start (e.g. Hamlet is thirty, so is probably just living in Wittenberg, rather than at the university there; Feste is probably middle-aged; Marcellus and Voltemand can be doubled in performance), comments on the names themselves ("Fortinbras" is French for "strong-armed"; "Rosenkrantz" was a good Danish name in 1600), and other sorts of information that don't occur to me right now. What I would like to get away from in the character-list, tho, is the tendency for the little essay to go charging off into explaining the character's fate, or speculating on their motivations. The problem with putting such material here is that it is backwards: we start talking about plot points before we have even encountered the synopsis.</p>
<p>OK, so far, so logical. The problem is that one may want to talk about, say, interesting interpretations of the part of Laertes but not do anything so grandiose as put out a special page for the purpose. What to do, and where to do it? Am I all wet in wishing to keep that sort of thing out of the "List of Characters"? — <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJrmccall_94e7.html" title="User:Jrmccall">Jrmccall</a> 22:51, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Afraid I'm taking a bit of a wiki-break. Real-world stuff. Thanks for the not-quite-a-barnstar! I'll give the main part of your posting some thought and hopefully reply when I'm back on Wikipedia more regularly.

Also, they're not all jerks: a summary of my opinion on that subject is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3ARevert%2C_block%2C_ignore&amp;diff=75143625&amp;oldid=74451605" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3ARevert%2C_block%2C_ignore&amp;diff=75143625&amp;oldid=74451605" rel="nofollow">here</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyJones_d8f9.html" title="User:AndyJones">AndyJones</a> 08:47, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Andy, Thanks your feedback on the entry for Reynolds. When I was working on the site with my friends we didn’t realize that it was a bit excessive. We included all the links to people in the Transversal Theatre Company because we discovered that they have pretty cool personal websites. Then we saw great opportunities to link to the introductory chapters on the Palgrave site. We hadn’t considered that we were promoting the publisher and book sales. Sorry about that. Basically, we just stuck every link we found to Reynolds on the entry, which turned out to be a bit much. So, we have removed all of the external links, except the one to UC Irvine theatre dept, and we reduced the size of all the photos, and we cut the photo for Transversal Enterprises because we have not written the entry yet for the book. Really, we figured that someone else would do it. Sincerely, Gregor</p>

<p>Hi Andy, I'm going on a WikiBreak due to work issues, just wanted to say sorry for leaving you in the lurch while civil war erupts on the authorship page! P.S. the true secret is that <i>Shakespeare wrote Bacon's works</i>. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Singing_Badger_db89.html" title="User:The Singing Badger">The Singing Badger</a> 16:57, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Yes, I knew it was something <i>like</i> that. No worries. I think you were right to back away from it. Expecting you to keep up the kind of detailed work you were doing in the midst of the current edit war would have been unfair on anybody.

<p>Hello, I'd just like to apologize for adding that quotation in The Smiths' Cemetry Gates to the article on Richard III, I didn't know it was inaccurate. But I'm intrigued now: do you know for a fact that line doesn't appear on the play?</p>

<p>Good evening. I noticed your recent changes on Rotary International Page. I have three questions&#160;:</p>
<ul>
<li>- may I know why you confirmed CeeGee changes and blanked mine&#160;?</li>
<li>- I would like to know in which city you live [I live in Lille, France], if possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you answer no, I would like to know why.</p>
<ul>
<li>- I would like to know if you are close to a service club [for example through your wife], and if yes, to which one.</li>

<p>I'd just to add that adding a citation for both those points is sort of moot - it's knowledge i picked up from a book earlier this semester, and finding it again would be... effortful. It's more or less an accepted point in New Historicist criticism concerning Strachey's influence upon Shakespeare's final play.</p>

<p>Dear Andy,</p>
<p>Thank you for your continued participation in the entry on Reynolds. On October 9, 2006 we wrote you the following message and made a number of changes to the entry that we thought would make it more objective:</p>
<p>“Dear Andy, Thanks your feedback on the entry for Reynolds. When I was working on the site with my friends we didn’t realize that it was a bit excessive. We included all the links to people in the Transversal Theatre Company because we discovered that they have pretty cool personal websites. Then we saw great opportunities to link to the introductory chapters on the Palgrave site. We hadn’t considered that we were promoting the publisher and book sales. Sorry about that. Basically, we just stuck every link we found to Reynolds on the entry, which turned out to be a bit much.

Really, we figured that someone else would do it. Sincerely, Gregor”</p>
<p>At this point, the only two things we can think of changing are: 1) The Reynolds’ quote from Performing Transversally. We are removing the last two sentences because they direct people to Reynolds personally -- by quoting his email address (which anyone can find on the web anyway) -- which may have overstepped the privacy of Reynolds’ personal space. 2) We are removing the word “better” from the second paragraph in the section on “The Devil’s House” because it is evaluative. If you have any suggestions on how to improve this wikientry, please let us know. We are removing the tag, but in no way does this suggest our unwillingness to further change the entry. We feel the tag does not need to be there, unless there is a clearly explained reason for it. Gratefully, Gregor</p>

<p>You reverted the contribution I made to the film adaptations of Hamlet. I'm new to editing Wikipedia, so I wasn't sure where to put my reply to you. I put my comments on the Talk page of the article, and then I discovered this page. Please see the article's Talk page for specific information about the sources I used for my contribution.</p>
<p>From other comments on this page, I see that you take the time to clean up articles that contain incorrect information. That is commendable. However, when you deleted my contribution via a reversion, you were wrong. The film is as legitimate an adaptation as that masterwork "Strange Brew." I thank you for your efforts, but sometimes you might be too quick to dismiss other people contributions. I glean from the other comments on this page that you are working on a Shakespeare book. I, too, know a little about Shakespeare and adapatations of his work. Also, I have a little bit of education in me. So, please don't be too hasty in your deletions, because sometimes you might be in error. As a Shakespeare scholar, I'm sure you'd be interested in learning more about Shakespeare, even if it's from an unexpected source.</p>
<p>By the way, I made "several" edits to the page because I'm new to the whole editing thing, and I kept finding minor errors after I saved the page. I was in haste, but I wanted to get the information up there. Actually, I assumed that someone would actually research the film and fill in the details, since there are so many detail-oriented people on Wikipedia. I never imagined that someone would actually delete my comments within one day. I thought people would be pleased to discover a quirky "new" adaptation. I'll try to be more careful when I make an entry. However, the information I posted is still accurate.</p>

<p>"Can you give a source for this change? I'm aware that you've pasted a lengthy synopsis into this page before, and I just want to be sure that this one doesn't violate anyone's copyright. I'll remove this in the next two days if there isn't a reply."</p>
<p>Thank you, but there is no source but myself. I am 100% that it doesn't violate a copyright and that's actually the reason I wrote it myself. I felt that the previous summary was slightly lacking and as I have read the play numerous times and performed from it, I felt I could enhance the summary. I also have added various quotes and monologues to the previous stub of The Two Gentlemen of Verona section in Wikiquote.</p>
<p>I hope you find my information accurate - I respect the opinion of a Shakespeare scholar and I'm certain you know much more than a fourteen-year-old. Because I am new to Wikipedia, I can get really confused as to how things work, so I know I've confused a few things.</p>
<p>The only source of my writings is William Shakespeare himself and - if you believe that The Two Gentlemen of Verona may be an adaptation of a previous play - Jorge de Montemayor. Thank you!</p>
