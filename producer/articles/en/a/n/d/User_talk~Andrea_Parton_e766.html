<p>First of all... I am a bi-male and my partner is a bi-female...so we should be on the same page vis a vis this fact. Secondly, although I am a non-Marxist Social Democrat and oppose the anti-individualist, freedom-denying political system of Communism, I do consider myself a truly progressive, unity-through-diversity desiring, socially and environmentally conscious, spiritual humanist! That said: I am really curious about a couple things; 1) Suppose you came up with the original idea, while being in a state of homelessness, of sitting out in public and holding a sign that read...let's say..."Truly Compassionate Human Being, Will Really Listen To You &amp; Give A Damn!", and suppose you met and truly helped hundred of people over several months and got somewhat famous for this activity/hobby/avocation...you name it... And suppose you were even offered the chance to have a movie made about your story, your life, your special ability to REALLY, and I mean REALLY care about each and every individual as though they were, each and every one of them, a dear friend of yours...suppose all that, and then a couple of years later, while you begin to notice that the media continues to twist your image and the contracts writers and studios offer are full of restrictions that show a certain contempt for your warmth and freedom, suppose then three guys, working at comfy jobs in an office, decide to sit out and, using the same basic sign, do something relatively superficial and definitely insincere: would you like that??? 2) Please go to <a href="http://www.infinitysociety.org/FREEADVICEMAN.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.infinitysociety.org/FREEADVICEMAN.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and read the entire sub-site and view the pictures...then come back to me and tell me who Amy Alkon and Minnick and Johnson really are... That all said, I really hope you do care about the truth and humanity, not just generally, but even vis a vis someone as controversial as I happen to be. I hope to hear from you soon...Best, JP Lightning-Feather 12:32, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello. Good work on <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jane_Fonda_5ebb.html" title="Jane Fonda">Jane Fonda</a>, and thanks for the contribution. However, you did not provide any <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">references or sources</a> in the article.

<li>Hi! I saw you editing the <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lynn_Conway_8058.html" title="Lynn Conway">Lynn Conway</a> node and thought I'd say thanks for helping out. I'd love to improve that node but don't know how. She's kinda one of my heroes/mentors, and I think she deserves better but I don't want to just parrot her webpage. Also, yay left wing feminism! <a href="../../../g/e/e/User%7EGeekGirlSarah_01b9.html" title="User:GeekGirlSarah">♥ GeekGirlSarah ♥</a> 22:52, 5 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yay, another friendly transwoman on Wikipedia! You could add the transsexual userbox to your user page! Also, I'm kind of hoping to actually add more content on Dr. Conway's engineering work and such, not so much on her activism. Maybe I should start by making dynamic instruction scheduling, but that'll require a lot of research that I don't have time to do tonight or tomorrow. <a href="../../../g/e/e/User%7EGeekGirlSarah_01b9.html" title="User:GeekGirlSarah">♥ GeekGirlSarah ♥</a> 01:37, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi there. About the article on <a href="../../../d/e/i/Deirdre_McCloskey_40ba.html" title="Deirdre McCloskey">Deirdre McCloskey</a> and the pronouns - we debated that on IRC, and concluded that since (prior to the surgery) McCloskey was male, the male pronoun was appropriate for that sentence.</p>
<p>After all, <i>he</i> is the one who had the surgery and became female. If <i>she</i> had had the surgery, would it not have resulted in becoming male?</p>

<p>Hi Andrea. I'm the mystic IP address who contributed the TS page. I myself prefer the term "transgendered", since the issue indeed is about gender identity and not sexual issues. I am myself a M2F TS who transitioned some 10 years ago and has been in the woodwork since.. I'd rather keep my identity anonymous, hence mere IP address rather than username.</p>

<p>Oops, I just read your message NOW. Well, the reason why I placed the succession box at the bottom of the page is for consistency. I started editing the pages beginning with the most recent winner (Reese Witherspoon) and the succession box in that article was at the bottom, which is also quite consistent with other articles (see NBA players), because it is usually grouped together with templates (see sports articles). I must admit that I'm not so certain when this is applied to film luminaries, but the main reason I edited these pages was not to move them at the bottom, but to add the film title wherein they earned the citation. So instead of reverting back to the pages before I edited them, it will be better if the succession box (with the film title) is just moved to the filmography section. Still, there has to be some consensus on whether to put the succession box at the bottom or to just placed it at some section.<a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoey80_5d25.html" title="User:Joey80">Joey80</a> 06:22, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello! While editing some other pages, some editors pointed out that a succession box might not be appropriate in such instances as awardees (like in the Oscars). This is a winner in the next year does not necessarily succeed the winner this year (like calling this year's winner an "ex-Oscar winner"), like a head of a country or an institution. So I'm beginning to think that since a template was used to tie all the Best Picture winners, maybe a template can also be used to tie all the winners in the same category. What do you say? Of course, being a template, it means putting it at the bottom of a page, so that will not cause that much trouble.<a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoey80_5d25.html" title="User:Joey80">Joey80</a> 08:21, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was making an analogy with autism in the sense that <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danah_boyd.html" title="Danah boyd">danah boyd</a>'s essay <a href="http://www.danah.org/papers/Supernova2004.html" class="external text" title="http://www.danah.org/papers/Supernova2004.html" rel="nofollow">"Autistic Social Software"</a> does; I think that saying that people shouldn't be expected to act like an autistic person in order to contribute to Wikipedia isn't the same as saying that <i>all</i> autistic people are asocial (for a silly analogy to that: saying that bicycles shouldn't be considered as a bad transportation option because some people are disabled isn't the same as saying that <i>all</i> disabled people can't ride bicycles.) <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatamorphism_4920.html" title="User:Catamorphism">Catamorphism</a> 20:30, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If you want to change it to "three times a week" I'll accept the change. Dispite the dual meaning of 'triweekly' I felt it sounded better and I think when most people hear triweekly they think of three times per week. I had considered writing 'three times a week' but to me it really lacks articulation and seems a bit amateur. Still, it's probably a more acurate way of stating it. I just wish there were a better way of saying it.</p>

<p>The entire paragraph was basically unsourced and was making broad derogratory allegations about transpeople in general.

<p>Hi Andrea, it's not a war. I was wrong, I made wrong templates adapting bond movies box navigation to other actors filmographies templates because I didn't know how to create it, but I didn't know that, and an user reverted it but he, too, didn't say to me what was wrong; but now he'd talked to me about that problem and I learned how to fix it.

<p>Apologies if this comment is in the wrong place but I simply wanted to communicate and explain some edits made to the page on transsexualism (and its etiology). While there are several statements to the fact that the cause of transsexualism is unknown, a number of passages very much appear to promote the view that it has biological cause.* I have tried to correct for this, while retaining as much of the original content as possible.</p>

<p>Hi Andrea, my name is Hank, a new Wikipedian. As I was putting myself into various categories and looking other people's Userpages to learn how to make my own, I saw your Userpage and from the first moment, I just knew I wanted to get to know you more, since we had quite a number of things in common (liberalism, environmentalism, feminism, transsexuality, for example). Look Andrea, I need your help because I need some information regarding transsexuality (since you are yourself a transsexual and you made a major contribution to the article on it). I see myself as a transsexual---I was born a male and now I remain a male, even though I don't like being a male and desire to be a female. From your Userboxes I can see that you are a transwoman. The thing I want to know, Andrea, is whether or not you are completely feminized? I mean, now you are a female, but do you still have any trace of maleness left? Sorry to ask you such a personal question. Since I am myself queer, I feel quite embarrassing to not know about the queer community that well, even though I see myself as one of the community. I know no queer people around me, that's why. Thanks very much! --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECantaire87_c3d9.html" title="User:Cantaire87">Cantaire87</a> 05:25, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Andrea! I happened to have time today so I am able to reply your note, and I think I am able to afford a couple of more exchanges of notes as well. In late March and whole April, however, I will be too busy again but I think I will have time in May.</p>
<p>I am glad that I am finally able to communicate with a LGBT person!&#160;:) Thanks so much for willing to communicate. Where shall we start?</p>
<p>The thing about my transsexuality is, it is questionable, under much stricter definitions (which I am against---I am in favor of flexible definitions). As much as I want to be a woman and feel highly interested in everything feminine, it is still really likely that I will choose to remain non-op (some people just deny that non-op people are trans). Why? practical reasons such as the finanical one compose a big factor, but I guess the ultimate reason is that I want more than a social female gender role---I want to get a biological one, too. For example, I want to get pregnant, give birth, and breastfeed. Current medical technology does not allow that, so as much as I am depressed, I may choose to not use it for transition at all, since it offers no cure for my suffering. (Important Note: I am not denying the fact that transwomen are women, even though they can't carry out biological roles. For me, social roles are enough to make a woman, but I still want more than that.)</p>
<p>So what is my solution of finding relief to the problem without a cure? I awake my female self and learn to tolerate the male self. It actually worked, to some extent. I'd created a literary world through writing and am living in it as a woman, a female voice. I feel comfortable when writing as a female voice, and it impressed my English teachers (I once wrote a poem as 19th-century woman who suffers from domestic abuse in male-dominated Victorian Britain, and my teacher commented that it was a really risky move. After she had read the poem, however, she was so impressed because she thought I'd really captured the woman's voice. What she didn't know is, I WAS that woman, so it was no risky move for me. It came to me quite naturally. Would you like to see the poem, by the way? You as a feminist might be interested.)</p>
<p>Okay, this note is already quite long, so I will end it just in case you don't like reading long notes. So, what do you think, Andrea? How much happiness do you obtain from your transition? Can you tell me more about your experiences? --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECantaire87_c3d9.html" title="User:Cantaire87">Cantaire87</a> 20:27, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Andrea, I am so sorry that I'd made you cry. I shouldn't had asked you about the details of your transition if it was indeed that painful and horrific for you. It's okay Andrea, we have so many queer friends and allies all around the globe fighting for our cause, and things will be better and brighter in the future. I myself was involved in an human rights organization called <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Coalition_Building_Institute_8bef.html" title="National Coalition Building Institute">National Coalition Building Institute</a>, and we were----and still are---trying to break down the barriers between different groups for friendship and understanding. I just wish I could fly to your side and give you a big hug to make you feel better. I totally accept who you are and see you as a woman and sister, Andrea, even if your progress for full transition was hindered.</p>
<p>I also want to thank you for confirming my queer status, since I do feel a sense of belonging to the queer community.&#160;:) Thanks, too, for telling me about Andrea James, and I really liked her website. By the way, when you and Andrea James are saying "coming-out", I am not sure what you meant. I thought "coming-out" meant revealation. Am I right?</p>
<p>Anyway, here is my poem I talked about last time (By the way, thanks for not minding reading long posts----you know I just love writing. I don't mind reading long posts, too----I like reading):</p>
<p>A 19th-century Woman's Desparate Cry</p>
<p><br />
Stop, John!</p>
<p>Do you know how much I am hurt inside?</p>
<p>Stop, John!</p>
<p>At least please do stop in front of the children's sight!</p>
<p>Stop, John!</p>
<p>You restrictions on me are too tight!</p>
<p>Stop, John!</p>
<p>You are simply not doing it right!</p>
<p><br />
On the very moment I became your wife,</p>
<p>I destroyed my identity totally to surrender to your love.</p>
<p>I was hoping for a new rebirth,</p>
<p>To become a happy woman who would be fully enjoying her life...</p>
<p><br />
At first you were very tender,</p>
<p>Always providing me warmth with your embrace when I shiver.</p>
<p>To have a happy familiy with several children was your dream,</p>
<p>And here we are----now you are three children's father...</p>
<p><br />
Both you and I loved the color of orange,</p>
<p>And so did our little George.</p>
<p>Our family had so many things in common,</p>
<p>I always wanted to write these happy memories down in a clean page...</p>
<p><br />
Suddenly things had began to change,</p>
<p>Alcohol had transformed you into a mad man with terrible rage.</p>
<p>I groaned and cried helplessly every time when you overwhelmed me,</p>
<p>And to me the home had become a cage...</p>
<p><br />
As a woman I am your property,</p>
<p>You have the total control over me.</p>
<p>I can do nothing to help myself----</p>
<p>Like what I'd said, you have the total control over me...</p>
<p><br />
I can hardly breathe because my corset is too tight,</p>
<p>Most of my dresses are cumbersome and unreasonably too wide.</p>
<p>Yet in this state of extreme physical discomfort I still have to suffer mentally,</p>
<p>To obey your stern orders without questions or die...</p>
<p><br />
I am willing to submit myself totally to you because I still love you,</p>
<p>And with tears I beg you to love me too.</p>
<p>Please grant this wish to your poor little devoted slave,</p>
<p>Please grant this wish to your poor little devoted slave...</p>
<p><br />
I wrote this poem after being inspired by a drawing I saw on a website. (to see it, follow the following link: <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Wmarriage.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Wmarriage.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Wmarriage.htm</a>) I basically wanted to show, as many as I can, the sufferings a Victorian woman had to gone through, such as the loss of legal identity after marriage, total subordination to her husband, restrictive and cumbersome clothing, unstatisfied emotional needs, etc. I debated with myself while writing this poem's end: shall I revolt against my husband (as I'd stated last time, I was the woman while composing the poem), or shall I continue to submit to rigid Victorian male authority? I finally decided to submit, since as a woman I'd no means to support myself without John, and at the same time, as the Victorian ideal about women's roles dictated, I was still willing to love and care for John even John had no respect for me.</p>
<p>Any comments, Andrea? What do you think about my poem? --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECantaire87_c3d9.html" title="User:Cantaire87">Cantaire87</a> 22:03, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>P.S.: If you prefer, I can interact with you as Hanna, my literary self. I know I'd introduced myself to you as Hank, but I would be glad to switch to my literary self (since we are penmates, we communicate by writing) when communicating with you. You can call me just by my name if you want----Cantaire87 is a much longer name to write.</p>

<p>Dear Andie, thanks for giving me an opportunity to introduce myself to you as a friend and sister!&#160;:) As Hank'd stated last time, I am Hanna, and I represent his <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakti.html" title="Shakti">Shakti</a> and female voice. What do I mean by "Shakti"? Well, it certainly does not mean that Hank and I are "divine" in a sense like a Hindu god and his Shakti, it is just because after an examination of few similar concepts (such as <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anima.html" title="Anima">anima</a> and <a href="../../../y/i/n/Yin.html" title="Yin">yin</a>), we had decided that (according to our own understanding), the best word to represent my identity is "Shakti". True, without me, Hank will be just like a corpse in a way, since he believes his vital energy and all happiness ultimately comes from me, a woman, once I am awakened.</p>
<p>Despite of the risks of possibly earning himself the title of multiple personality disorder, Hank'd decided on my behalf (how sweet of him: he will do anything to defend me while the outsiders are calling him crazy, and he loves me and enjoys my companionship) to let me step out of my literary world and interact with you, since he knows how much do I long for a sister figure with the purpose of discovering more about myself as woman after my recent awakening. Will you accept me as a sister, dear Andie, as I am willing to accept you as mine? I believe that being the part of a sisterhood, like being a mother, is really important to a woman's identity. Certainly, it will help you as a woman a lot, too, I am sure.</p>
<p>We will have a great time together, Andie, I assure you.&#160;:) Hank, you and I all have much in common (such as feminism, environmentalism, etc.) and I look forward in the future to have exciting discussions with you on these interesting topics, and I am sure you are full of great insights.</p>
<p>Because of the busy schedule, I probably cannot talk with you again until May. See you then! With love from Hanna --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECantaire87_c3d9.html" title="User:Cantaire87">Cantaire87</a> 04:37, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
