<p><font size="+1" color="yellow">Here's some extra tips to help you get around in the 'pedia!</font></p>
<ul>
<li><font size="+1" color="yellow">If you want to play around with your new Wiki skills the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Wikipedia%7ESandbox_ae3e.html" title="Wikipedia:Sandbox">Sandbox</a> is for you.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1" color="yellow">You can sign your name using three tildes (~). If you use four, you can add a datestamp too.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1" color="yellow">You may want to add yourself to the <a href="../../../n/e/w/Wikipedia%7ENew_user_log_052c.html" title="Wikipedia:New user log">new user log</a>.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1" color="yellow">You should also consider (if you have not already) creating a <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndres_C._906d.html" title="User:Andres C.">user page</a> for yourself, to tell us a bit about you. Don't worry if it's small at first -- most people tend to grow their user pages over a period of time, much like Wikipedia articles. Don't expect everything to happen all at once!</font></li>
<li><font size="+1" color="yellow">If you ever think a page or image should be deleted, please list it at the <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_b940.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion">votes for deletion</a> page. There is also a <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_undeletion_ecb6.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for undeletion">votes for undeletion</a> page if you want to retrieve something that you think should not have been deleted.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1" color="yellow">If you're still entirely confused, or would like to get a better grasp of your wikipedia skills, and you have an <a href="../../../i/r/c/IRC_b274.html" title="IRC">IRC</a> client (or don't mind getting one), check out the <a href="../../../b/c/_/WP%7EBC_a86f.html" title="WP:BC">Bootcamp</a>. It's not what it sounds like, but it is fun and can help you with your editing skills.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1" color="yellow">If you're bored and want to find something to do, try the <i>Random page</i> button in the sidebar, or check out the <i>Open Task</i> message in the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Wikipedia%7ECommunity_Portal_6a3c.html" title="Wikipedia:Community Portal">Community Portal</a>.</font></li>

<dd><font size="+1" color="yellow">You don't want the images to be much bigger than 250 px anyway. Remember, 250 px is small if your monitor is at a high resolution. If you are at a library or low-income facility/country and your monitor is at 640x480, a 250 px photo will take up half the page. This is less of a problem when the adjacent text is narrow (i.e. specs) so the 3-views have been in the 350 px range, but it gets oppressive if it squishes all the text.

<p><font size="+1" color="yellow">Greetings Andres.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" color="yellow">I'm a bit confused, but you might be able to help me out. I checked with the <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_of_Ecuador_aeb5.html" title="Flag of Ecuador">flag of Ecuador</a> which states that the official size ratio of the Ecuadorian flag is 1:2 The image I used had exactly this ratio. Is this information incorrect? Flags of the World also mentions the 1:2 ratio. <a href="http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/ec.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/ec.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> The image you are using has a size ratio of 2:3</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" color="yellow">My knowledge about South America is extremely rusty, but I think I once read something about the size having to do with making the flag easier to distinguish from the one of Colombia, but I'm no expert on the matter.

<dd><font size="+1" color="yellow">"On September 26, 1860, Gabriel Garcia Moreno, Supreme Chief of Government, decreed the flag change to its present (and ancient) colours, adopting the ratio 1:2 which differentiates Ecuador flag to that of Colombia (which would adopt the same distribution of its tricolori the following year)." <a href="http://fotw.vexillum.com/flags/ec.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://fotw.vexillum.com/flags/ec.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> Does the note about 1860 seem familiar at all? The post looks like it was made by a person with a Spanish name, but unfortunately no nationality or source is listed.</font></dd>

<dd><font size="+1" color="yellow">I've tried the webpage of the Ecuadorian embassy in Stockholm, Sweden: <a href="http://www.embajada-ecuador.se/Info.HTM#flag" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.embajada-ecuador.se/Info.HTM#flag" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>; no specification and they use a third ratio. The Embassy of Ecuador in the United States uses a fourth (3:5) <a href="http://www.ecuador.org/ecuador/Symbols.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ecuador.org/ecuador/Symbols.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> I've also tried the interwiki versions of <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_of_Ecuador_aeb5.html" title="Flag of Ecuador">Flag of Ecuador</a> and the Dutch version lists these ratios: "Civil flag" (1:2), Merchant flag (on ships) (2:3), Naval flag (2:3) and Presidential flag (1:1). The images seem to have been drawn by <a href="../../../h/u/h/User%7EHuhsunqu_bc0e.html" title="User:Huhsunqu">User:Huhsunqu</a> from Peru, but no source is listed.

<dd><font size="+1" color="yellow">Btw, before we started communicating, I'd been replacing a redundant image (<a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Ecuador_%28state%29.svg_18b2.html" title="Image:Flag of Ecuador (state).svg">Image:Flag of Ecuador (state).svg</a>) with <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Ecuador.svg_e6f8.html" title="Image:Flag of Ecuador.svg">Image:Flag of Ecuador.svg</a>, but both of them use the 1:2 ratio and are vitually identical - nevertheless I somewhat regret doing so now. If no proper specification exists, then by all means use the image you feel is the most correct. Remember that we have both {{<a href="../../../e/c/u/Template%7EEcuador-stub_b820.html" title="Template:Ecuador-stub">Ecuador-stub</a>}}, {{<a href="../../../e/c/u/Template%7EEcuador-geo-stub_8743.html" title="Template:Ecuador-geo-stub">Ecuador-geo-stub</a>}}, and {{<a href="../../../e/c/u/Template%7EEcuador-geo-stub_8743.html" title="Template:Ecuador-geo-stub">Ecuador-geo-stub</a>}} For some time, Ive been considering a stub template for Ecuadorian politicians as well and in fact we have enough material, but unfortunately it will cut down the "people" category too much, so I've put that plan on hold for the time being.</font></dd>

<dd><font size="+1" color="yellow">Thanks for the info. Interesting story and the pictures look pretty.

The highest point in Denmark is 171 meters - so Denmark is as flat as a pancake. But Danes refer to a point of c. 147 meters as <i>Himmelbjerget</i> (= <i>Sky Mountain</i>) <a href="../../../../da/h/i/m/Himmelbjerget.html" class="extiw" title="da:Himmelbjerget">da:Himmelbjerget</a>. Virtually all of Denmark is farmland (although the land in Western <a href="../../../j/u/t/Jutland.html" title="Jutland">Jutland</a> is too sandy to grow grain so they grow potatoes). We have a few forests (12% or so), which have basically all been replanted, since they were all cut down before 1800. And you may call your country small, but it is more than six times larger than mine.
