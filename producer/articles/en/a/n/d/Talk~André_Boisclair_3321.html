<p>Vfp15 removed a reference to Boisclair's sexuality, saying it didn't needed to be mentioned more than once... but now the article never mentions it, except to imply it by talking about the polls done about that. Shouldn't we actually mention the man is gay, if it warrants being talked about? -<a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregoryWeir_b38e.html" title="User:GregoryWeir">GregoryWeir</a> 21:25, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've tried to incoporate this in an appropriate way. Really, the only noteworthy thing is that it seems not to be an issue. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> 22:07, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Exactly. He is not a gay politician, he is a mainstream politician who is gay. It would be fine to mention his sexual orientation in a more developed bio section, but not when the section is as short as it is here. Many other things matter more than his being gay. For example, he attended the Collège Jean de Brébeuf, as did Pierre Trudeau and Robert Bourassa. On the other hand, his sexuality was a question at the polls which brought to light that it's pretty much a non-issue: people are more concerned with how Boisclair plans to reduce waiting time in healthcare and the militant wing of the P.Q. is more concerned with his stance on separation. Where Landry was a pragmatic man who believed separation better left aside for a while, Boisclair is a commited separatist with a pragmatic plan to move towards separation. These are the questions that matter to Boisclair and the electorate. <a href="../../../v/f/p/User%7EVfp15_4f08.html" title="User:Vfp15">Vincent</a> 05:05, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>So, my 2¢: I think that it is notable that Bosclair is gay, and should be reflected in the opening sentences of his biography. All of the above is true, but I'd like to point out that <b>Bosclair is notable for being gay just as much as being a separatist</b>. Particularly here in English-speaking Toronto the news items about his candidacy probably would not have run if there were not something interesting about him, i.e. his sexuality. This is in the same vein that <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandra_Day_O%27Connor_a3d1.html" title="Sandra Day O'Connor">Sandra Day O'Connor</a> is notable as the first woman <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Supreme_Court_2553.html" title="U.S. Supreme Court">U.S. Supreme Court</a> justice. Despite his personal protestations, it is a characteristic that makes him notable. <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleduc_26ee.html" title="User:Cleduc">Cleduc</a> 15:45, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I agree that his sexuality should not be buried in the article. But as far as it being in the "opening sentences", there are only six sentences in the article. I don't think that his sexuality is exactly buried at this point. In fact, it is probably over-played in taking one of those six sentences. That problem will be resolved over time as more is added. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> 15:55, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree that it doesn't really deserve any more prominence that it currently receives. While I haven't exactly been following the race closely, I've been paying a reasonable amount of attention to it, and I was completely unaware Boisclair was gay. The cocaine issue has received much more attention, especially because of Michaëlle Jean's joke. --<a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESaforrest_5781.html" title="User:Saforrest">Saforrest</a> 03:30, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Boisclair's victory is important because he seems likely to lead Quebec into a new referendum on separation; the fact that he's gay barely rises above the level of trivia. It would matter in the identity-driven politics of the US, but in Quebec it's a non-issue. I'm inclined to think the emphasis on his sexuality in the article is US POV. 69.70.136.130 03:05, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The mainstream media barely felt mention of his sexuality necessary, from what I recall, but this article harps on it and harps on it.

<p>I took the liberty of adding two sentences to the opening paragraph addressing the level of importance that should be attached to his sexual preference at this level of politics. I found it necessary, as his sexual preference is remarked in the link from the Wikipedia main page. You can't get more direct than that.</p>

<p>Preference is a misleading term used to emphasize a voracious sexuality. The preferred term today is Sexual Orientation, which allows the possibility that LGBT people may still identify as LGBT even if celibate or sexually inactive.</p>

<p>I am a member of the Parti Québécois and I wish to correct something. Boisclair did not say that he would unilaterally declare independance. What he DID say however was that he would negociate with the federal government after a majority of YES has been obtained, but in an event of unfruitful negociations, he would THEN have no shame into unilaterally declaring independance.</p>

<p><i>"If Boisclair became Premier of Quebec, he would be the first openly homosexual person to be elected as a North American head of government (former New Jersey Governor Jim McGreevey was the first openly homosexual person to serve as head of government, but came out after being elected). Boisclair's victory also makes him the first openly gay politician in Canada to win the leadership of a party with legislative representation. (Previous openly homosexual Canadian political party leaders Chris Lea of the Green Party of Canada and Allison Brewer of the New Brunswick New Democratic Party led much less politically prominent parties.)"</i></p>
<p>It's already mentioned that he is homosexual, but do we really need over an hundred words to say that "He was the first.. (details).. that was homosexual and (details)". If we need to go into details to explain that he was the first 'something', I don't think it's worth adding. The above should be removed unless it's really important to note that he was the first <i>openly</i> homosexual person to be elected <i>as a North American</i> head of government.</p>
<p>Oh, and the first sentence about his homosexuality is wrong, as noted in my quote, Jim McGreevy was the first openly gay head of government in North America.</p>

<p>First off, I am the one who re-wrote the entire article to fix the level of English.</p>
<p>I feel that the comments on the level of Boisclair's education and the scandal he was involved in warrant a place on this page. First, it is important that English Canadians and that members of the English speaking world understand that CEGEP is in fact an extension of the secondary school system in Quebec. All too often I have seen Quebec politicans (and Quebecers from ordinary walks of life) who did not obtain a post secondary degree claim that their CEGEP qualifications count as "degree". By English standards, this is at best a distortion and at worst and intentional misrepresentation. Ontario used to have the similar system as Quebec, changed about 4 years ago. In Ontario, grade 12 (Ontario Secondary School Diploma) did not qualify a student for university. A student's university entrance was contigent on completing a 13th year (like CEGEP) - the Ontario Academic Credit program. In this system, students had to study 6 semester-long courses - ususally in a specialize program of study - as a prerequisite for university placement. This system was similar to the CEGEP program currently in place in Quebec. However, under no circumstances would someone from Ontario be able to claim that his/her OAC diploma could stand in for an actual degree of any kind. In this sense, both the former OAC program and CEGEP are secondary school qualifications - even though in French the CEGEP diploma uses the title Bacc in CEGEP diploma. This is simply a (and in most cases an honest) translation issue, but the fact remains CEGEP qualifications are not degrees.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Why have you deleted the name of the student organization? Why do you claim that I have done a "<b>intentional misrepresentation</b>"? What kind of paranoia is that? You should get some information about the Cégep system before butchering what other people write. Under the Quebec system, <b>Cegep is post-Secondary school</b>. This is the REALITY in our education system, and this is how it works. End of the argument. -- <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHugo_Dufort_c2ee.html" title="User:Hugo Dufort">Hugo Dufort</a> 23:20, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And by the way, your claim that "<i>in French the CEGEP diploma uses the title Bacc in CEGEP diploma</i>" is absolutely false. The Cégep diploma is called a DEC (Diplôme d'études collégiales). The Bacc is the university-level undergraduate diploma. Check your references. -- <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHugo_Dufort_c2ee.html" title="User:Hugo Dufort">Hugo Dufort</a> 01:20, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Second, the scandal the Boisclair was involved in is relevant for this page. It is the responsibility of the public to carefully examine breeches of the public trust in which elected officials become involved. The cocaine and embezzlement scandal surrounding his office would, under normal circumstances, finish a politician's career. That Boisclair has rebounded in such spectacular fashion may point to the underlying values of the PQ itself - secession at all costs.</p>

<p>Someone has written in the article that "Boisclair has never obtained an undergraduate diploma". This is derogarory, and it is of no relevance. Later in the article we learn that Boisclair has received a <b>Master's Degree</b>. So there is no reason for insisting about his undergraduate diplomas (or their alleged absence). Unless you hate Boisclair and want to smear him, of course. Oh, and I have removed the link to the Globe and Mail article because it requires a subscription. Parts of the "cocaine scandal" claims go far beyond what I've read in the news.

<p>Mr Dufort, this has become a bit silly. I would like to stress that as this article about Boisclair appears on the English wikipedia site, it becomes confusing to claim that CEGEP constitutes a post secondary degree. The truth is simple - CEGEP fills a similar role to the former OAC program in Ontario. From the English point of view, post secondary education implies at least and undergraduate degree or a technical college diploma. We must bear in mind that CEGEP QUALIFIES students for university undergraduate programs in Quebec, thus making it part of the SECONDARY SCHOOL TRAINING process. While Quebecers are well aware of the nuances, most outside Quebec are not. This distinction must be made clear for English readers. I also believe that readers should be able to readily learn about all the levels of education (or lack thereof) their political leaders have obtained. I for one want to know how well educated my political candidates are before I go to the polls.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Half the students in Cégep are taking <i>technical</i> courses (3 years / 6 semesters), and are NOT preparing for university. They are learning a profession. Do you become a <i>Technician in Civil Engineering</i> with only a high school diploma? Nope. -- <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHugo_Dufort_c2ee.html" title="User:Hugo Dufort">Hugo Dufort</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Finally, my citations on the cocaine-Doray affair are accurate claim exactly what I have written. The Globe and mail article can be viewed without a subscription (just a user name a password are required). Wikipedia must be a fair source of information and the sordid dealings of Boisclair and his chief of staff should be held up to the same level of scrutiny as the Liberal sponsorship scandal. Furthermore, this information should appear in the early career section - not the party leadership area.</p>
<p>In my revised version I do make it clear that Boisclair did not resign from the NA as a result of the scandal. In my earlier post, I did not mean to imply that he had and I apologize it this caused any confusion.</p>
<dl>
<dd>When the Globe article was published, it was early, and all details about the Doray affair were not known. Thus the article contains speculation and claims that later proved to be unfounded. Call it sensationalism. All the other sources gave a different and more accurate view on the matter; however, most English-language newspapers did not bother to cover the story at this point. Boisclair was called as a witness in the inquiry about the Doray frauds; he was never accused.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The cocaine scandal and the Doray affair only emerged last year, and influenced recent events. So although it concerns Boisclair's early years as a minister, it deserves to be covered further down in the page. -- <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHugo_Dufort_c2ee.html" title="User:Hugo Dufort">Hugo Dufort</a> 01:16, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Mr Dufort, I have reverted the article once again (with changes to help accommodate your wishes) to more fairly reflect the depth of the scandal Boisclair's office was involved in and to clarify his educational background. Everything is cited appropriately. I hope you can live with the changes – I am trying to be as fair as possible. I am the one who re-wrote the entire original article to strengthen the English. I have eliminated the passive voice as much as possible (please do not re-introduce the passive voice - it's weak writing) and, to the best of my knowledge, there are no spelling mistakes in the article. (My discussion posts are written colloquially on purpose.)</p>
<p>BTW "party animal" is the exact description used in the cited CBC article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The term is derogatory and is not suitable for inclusion in an encyclopedia article. Your version of the article seems to follow your own personal (very negative) opinion on André Boisclair. Your choices of topics, the ordering, and the general focus give a very negative impression of Mr Boisclair.

<p>Mr Dufort, if you are going to change the entry, please stop using the passive voice - it sounds awful in English. I have included facts that are well cited. If you want to put a "positive spin" on his early career, try including positive legislation that he wrote or passed (of which I do not know of any) instead of leaving out the scandal centered on his office. Declaring my entry as unfair would be the same as declaring the entry on the Iran-Contra affair under Reagan's administration prejudicial (Reagan was not indicted on any crimes) - the same would go for leaving out the Chappaquiddick incident on Ted Kennedy. The truth must be known.</p>
<p>Also, please do not construe my posts as anti-anything. I am a proud French-Canadian and I value my French heritage. I am also proud of my how my father (an English Protestant) stood up - as the mayor of a French-Canadian pulp and paper town - for French rights in the 1960s and even married into a French Canadian family. This is how the great country of Canada was built.</p>
<p>I apologize for the removal of the post on the parody - it was not my intention. It appears it is being removed by someone else and I am trying to revert the site to its original form. I will included your post in further reverts. Cheers K.

<p>As an interesting side note, compare the educational background of the leaders of the separatist movement to the leaders of other major parties in Canada. The new leader of the Liberal party holds a PhD, the leader of the NDP holds a PhD, and the leader of the Conservatives holds a Master's degree (with original research). On the other hand, Duceppe holds what amounts essentially to a CEGEP diploma and Boisclair holds a one year Master's degree from a special program at Harvard that does not require candidates to hold a previous undergraduate degree (which Boisclair does not). Furthermore, unlike Harper's Master' degree, Boisclair did not contribute original research while studying. In fact, the only thing that got Boisclair into the JFK school of government was his years of service as an elected politician and $33,000 USD – hardly the exemplar of a brilliant mind.</p>
<p>The separatist movement in Quebec – in comparison to their opposition – is lead by unread, uneducated, populist leaders. That sums up the PQ's and the Bloc's values – populism over substance or intellect. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 86.133.143.98 (<a href="../../../8/6/2E/User_talk%7E86.133.143.98.html" title="User talk:86.133.143.98">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.133.143.98_a64c.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.133.143.98">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Okay, I've replaced some of the deleted material in order to give more context, background, and improve NPOV. However, I've also edited drastically for length, from 316 words down to 237, which is less than the rest of the 2007 election section (242 words), and described the affair as a "minor controversy". It's as concise as I can make it while still being fair and balanced. I hope this version is more widely acceptable; let me know what you think. <a href="../../../m/v/c/User%7EMvcorks_1f7e.html" title="User:Mvcorks">mvc</a> 16:41, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Talk%7EAndr%C3%A9_Boisclair_3321.html" title="Edit section: Openly gay, not married, no children">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Openly gay, not married, no children</span></h2>
<p>I do not dispute that Mr. Boislair's sexuality merits mention in the article (there is, in fact, a whole paragraph that discusses it). However, since gay people do in fact get married and have children, his sexuality has no bearing on his marital or parental status, and it is inappropriate to mention the three issues together as if they are all related.</p>
<p>As for his unmarried status, and whether it merits a mention in the article -- almost a third of Quebec families are common law (i.e. unmarried), which is almost three times the level in the rest of Canada. Do we know for sure that Boisclair does not have a partner? Given the Quebec statistics, his single-status should be sourced before the article suggests that he does not have a spouse -- like many Quebecers, he may have a spouse, but simply not be married. Not being officially married would not be unusual in Quebec.</p>
<p>I don't know if he has a spouse or not. Once we have the facts, and they can be sourced, then add it to the article. As for children, I am not convinced that it is "unusual" for younger politicians not to have children, but I don't feel strongly about the issue either way. <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkeezix1000_63e3.html" title="User:Skeezix1000">Skeezix1000</a> 14:29, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
