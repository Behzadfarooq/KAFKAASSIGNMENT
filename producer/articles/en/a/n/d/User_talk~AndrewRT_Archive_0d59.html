<p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>I just wanted to thank you for the work you've started on the BahÃ¡'i Faith pages.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for your comments. Hope you like the wikinews articles and would appreciate any thing you could contribute there too! <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewRT_eb6f.html" title="User:AndrewRT">AndrewRT</a> 21:36, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>A couple comments regarding general Wikipedia etiquette. One is that usually linking to a lot of pages that don't exist as of yet, is not encouraged (the red links)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Interesting point. I'm still quite new to wikipedia so I'm not 100% sure yet of what is and what isn't considered appropriate. Can you point me to a wikipedia policy that talks about whether red links are appropriate?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I do note that the Baha'i faith articles seem to have very few red links indeed - in fact I saw the first one today! This seems to me to be quite exceptional. Other wikipedia pages I have been involved in regularly create red links so that other contributors can "fill in the gaps" later. I've just tried clicking "random article" a few times and found roughly half the articles had red links in them. Red links can play a good part in keeping the wikispace dynamic - always expanding, always incorporating new ideas. Besides, I only created the links so I could come back and write the articles later - nothing wrong with that.</dd>
</dl>
<p>and another is what is an appropriate article. Links should be made, once the article exists, as the red links take away from the links that do exist. Also people who are not very prominent are usually marked for deletion,</p>
<dl>
<dd>Again can you point me in direction of a wikipedia policy that says this? The closest I could find was one that said you shouldn't create an article about yourself. <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">What wikipedia is not</a> states the following:</dd>
</dl>
<p>"Genealogical entries, or phonebook entries: Biography articles should only be for people with some sort of fame, achievement, or perhaps notoriety. One measure of achievement is whether someone has been featured in several external sources (on or off-line). Minor characters may be mentioned within other articles (e.g. Ronald Gay in Persecution of gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and the transgendered). See m:Wikipeople for a proposed genealogical/biographical dictionary project."</p>
<dl>
<dd>Individual Continental Counsellors are in a position of significant influence in the Baha'i Faith. They do indeed have "some sort of acheivement" to their name. I can't see why it isn't appropriate to have articles on them in the same way that <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_of_Llandaff_8c56.html" title="Bishop of Llandaff">Bishop of Llandaff</a> does - similarly with plenty of red links!</dd>
</dl>
<p>and articles that are non-encyclopedic are also usually deleted. Particullary the article on the diacritical marks on the word BahÃ¡'i, BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h and so forth is mostly a practice, and is not really encyclopedic. The statement at the bottom of the BahÃ¡'i Faith I think is usually enough. Once again thanks. -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 21:24, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There is some debate within the Baha'i community as to when it is appropriate to use diacritical marks. Indeed I thought to raise it as an issue when I started looking at wikipedia but then found the discussion on the talk pages. I though it would be better to have this as an article then ew people coming to the ages in 5 years time won't start up the debate yet again. Also (more importantly) I can put a link it from wikinews and save from having to explain it all over again. As I'm sure you're aware you can't link to a talk page!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't mean to have a rant - I recognise that I'm new to wikis and a lot to learn. If you want to recommend an article for deletion go ahead but don't think I wont oppose it. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewRT_eb6f.html" title="User:AndrewRT">AndrewRT</a> 21:36, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry I didn't mean to be insultive. I should have left an explanation somewhere.</p>

<p>Ah well I claim nothing more than heresay&#160;:). Hence why I ddin't include it on the article. Where was the original source for the count you came up with?

<p>Yeaaaah... I got that message from someone a while ago and didn't think it was even worth responding to... I'm starting to regret that as people keep informing me of the Juan Cole situation on my talk page&#160;:).</p>
<p>Well anyway since you're relatively new here and no-ones done it I thought I'd add a nice welcome for you at the top. I'm a lot less active that I used to be but still am on wikipedia most days. If you need any help with anything to do with wikipedia let me know - I think I've probably been around the longest out of most people here (although Jeff may just about beat me). I used to concentrate on the Baha'i History pages but got bored when people started to be more interested in Baha'i beliefs etc (as it was all circumstantial).</p>

<dd>History pages aren't so impressive on first viewing but I found it really facinating finding out what parts of Baha'i myth are based on truth and what aren't. Had to a lot of research into what actually happened in <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaykh_Tabarsi_7074.html" title="Shaykh Tabarsi">Shaykh Tabarsi</a>, did Azal really make a claim to be HWGSMM etc. Being born a Baha'i I was brought up with all this, but never entirely sure whether it was heresay or real. This I guess gave me an excuse to find out. -- <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomhab_fa0f.html" title="User:Tomhab">Tomhab</a> 00:34, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for adding all that info! When I created that page, I was assuming that it would quickly descend into the morass of Israeli-Palestinian backbiting that seems to inevitably cling to the topic on Wikipedia, so imagine my surprise when nobody else even edited it until now. I'm grateful that someone with more information than I have has contributed.</p>
<p>One question: you have the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine as the major component of both the Martyr Abu Ali Mustafa list and the Alternative list. I'm assuming either that this is incorrect or there's more to this story that needs explaining. Did the PFLP break into mutually hostile factions recently or am I misremembering?</p>
<p>Also, do you know anything about the mechanics of how the proportinal representation of this election will work? Is it just based on the national vote or is it distributed regionally somehow? And are the non-proportinal legislators elected from single-seat constituencies or from multiseat constituencies? Just thought I'd ask as you seem more in the know than I. --<a href="../../../j/f/r/User%7EJfruh_0123.html" title="User:Jfruh">Jfruh</a> 19:57, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry. I thought (rv to Jeff300 last. Disambiguation link at top of page is clear. Issues already discussed in "Baha'i divisions" and "Covenant.") in the edit summary was clear enough.

<dd>Ahh. Well, I think discussing Covenant Breaking on the main page is irrelevant. There's plenty of opportunity to see it in "Baha'i divisions" and Mason Remey is already discussed in the "Baha'i administration" section with ample links. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMARussellPESE_d65e.html" title="User:MARussellPESE">MARussellPESE</a> 14:06, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't see faults in the Baha'i electoral process. Of course the application of the process can be a different matter. I commented only on the International Convention and appointments to the ITC because it concerns the head of the Baha'i Faith. The electoral process at the national level is often likely to be significantly less mature. Having known some of the House members for decades, I do not have the slightest doubts about their selfless motivation. This does not address the issue of "incumbency", which is instead a matter of inertia among delegates. When asked recently about accusations that the House of Justice is self-selecting, Ali Nakhjavani opined that there will be more frequent changes in House membership in future, when information is more widely available. Keep in mind that there are many delegates who do not have ready access to the internet and other knowledge resources before they travel to International Conventions, but this will change. On your other point, Baha'is are not permitted to nominate or campaign in Baha'i elections because otherwise, I believe, the question of ego arises, which is contrary to Baha'i principles. This places a heavier burden on the electors to ensure that they are well informed, which is a characteristic of Baha'i elections rather than a systemic weakness. --<a href="../../../o/c/c/User%7EOccamy_964a.html" title="User:Occamy">Occamy</a> 22:01, 7 February 2006 (UTC) p.s.

<dl>
<dd>Ironically, it was the discussion about Baha'i elections on Wikipedia that prompted me to ask Mr. Nakhjavani and for his personal comment.

<p>Andrew, regarding adding the other religion See Also stuff, see Messianic Prophecies (Apocrypha). I figured out how to do the multi-column list to keep the size reasonable. I have not yet changed the list I had added. By the way, I did see a 3-column list in another article. <b><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickReinckens_8aaa.html" title="User:RickReinckens">RickReinckens</a> 03:53, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</b></p>
<p>Re your response on my talk page. "See also" lists often are fairly broad, particularly on religion pages. A number of them have subcategories. The ones near the top would be directly on point with the article and the ones further down would be more general. For instance, on a Protestant page those near the top might be various Protestant denominations and general Christian topics, then an Other Christian Religions group with links regarding Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodox, etc., then perhaps a Non-Christian Religions section. It's sort of like a thesaurus, where all of them relate to a broad concept and they keep getting further and further away from the specific concept.</p>
<p>When you say, the Bible is inspired but certain specific teachings are superseded, do you mean like Christianity/Judaism where most biblically-based teachings of Judaism were taken into Christianity or do you mean Christianity/Islam where Islam basically says the Bible is true and then tosses it out and essentially starts from scratch? People who are not specifically Baha'i may want to link to other scriptures for comparative descriptions.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind that many people know virtually nothing about <i>any</i> religion's scriptures. I was raised Roman Catholic, I had 90 s.h. in literature and foreign languages undergrad, I spent a year in a Ph.D. program, I'm a lawyer, I later took accounting and passed two parts of the CPA exam (only took two), and I read constantly and with a background like that I was in my mid-40's before I found out there are different Bible translations. (And Catholics <i>don't</i> use the King James Version.)</p>

<p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>I'll let you know next time I put an article up for deletion that you have started. I just assumed that the page was on your watchlist. By the way it was Wiki-uk who suggested the delete to me, and since he didn't know how do to it, I put up the notice for him. I really don't think that the Counsellors, just for the sake of being Counsellors, are notable enough for being in Wikipedia. They just don't meet the notability requirements of Wikipedia (Of course, if they have done something else, then they should be in Wikipedia). At the same time, it's not my primary concern to go and delete these pages, but because Wiki-uk asked me, I went ahead with it. For example, Wjhonson, has just added some Hands of the Cause, and to be honest, I don't even know enough about them as a Baha'i, and thus the general populace would not know anything about them and thus I don't think their notable enough, even as Hands of the Cause. But like I said, I'm not going to put up delete notices for them, as it's not really my primary concern. Does this make sense? -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 14:56, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. If a vandal continues to vandalise after receiving the "last warning" (like the one you saw me give our friend 72), or if they harass other users, the next step is to request <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrator_intervention_against_vandalism_ffcc.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism">administrator intervention against vandalism</a>.</p>
<p>I see this particular vandal has already been blocked, but generally you go to the AIV page and report them using the following format: <b>"{{vandal|username_or_ip}} optional brief reason for listing (keep it short) -- ~~~~"</b>. If the vandal hasn't quit after the last warning, they will be <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">blocked</a> shortly.</p>
<p>You can visit my personal <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChodorkovskiy_Armory_fd8d.html" title="User:Chodorkovskiy/Armory">Armory</a> for tools to combat vandalism.

<p>His ethnicity is not "offically" known, as he doesn't believe in ethnicity and thinks ethnicity/nationality goes against Islam. His biography page does not mention any ethnicity and you wont find much luck throughout the rest of the internet. What I can tell you is that when I was raised in Iraq, we were always told that he was an arab, but never wanted to make an issue about it. If he is not an arab, then what do you suggest him being of? Persian? If non-Shia knew he was non-arab, do you have any idea the amount of uprising would go against him, for him controling the Iraqi shia? So, I think its almost a must for him to be an arab. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChaldean_d16d.html" title="User:Chaldean">Chaldean</a> 23:54, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What he meant in that statement is that he doesn't want to be involved in Iraqi politics directly, since he isn't "Iraqi." He said "Iranian" in a way of being from the state of Iran, ie having Iranian citizenship, not "Iranian" as in <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_people.html" title="Iranian people">Iranian people</a>.

<p>I think that good practice requires that an explanation for the prod nomination should be placed in the template box, so it's picked up by the toolserver, etc (the toolserver is down right now, but that's not the point.) The AfD you refer to was contested, an indication that prod wasn't the best choice anyway.

<p>One reason I decided to make it a redirect rather than deleting was that it meant the edit history would still be available, which wouldn't be the case if the article were deleted by an AfD. As far as I could tell, most of the contributors were at best misguided as to what wikipedia was, and at worst were merely wanting to promote their point of view. I felt it read like an essay, rather than an article. I noted it a couple of months ago, and no-one has fixed it since. I thought that rather than trying to edit it, I'd give the article a quiet semi-death and let someone else write a more appropriate article.

<p>Assertion? I do not believe I am "asserting" anything.

<p>Hi Andrew</p>
<p>When I went through the page translating it from French to English, I noticed that several of the dates in the 1960s overlapped. The period I'm referring to starts with Adam Ndele and ends with Joseph Ileo. First problem: The terms of office of Adam Ndele and Justin Marie Bomboko are overlapping but I don't know which period is correct (or if there were two claimants to the same post). Second problem (and my main concern) was the way Antoine Gizenga breaks up the chronology of the list. Taking a second glance, it seems like he was the leader of a rebellion, but in that case, I'm not sure why he is listed in the main chronology. If this is indeed the case, perhaps he should be moved out of the main list or the situation clarified a bit? Just my thoughts.

<p>Please reread the article's intro. It is a list of organizations considered terrorist by other authorities.

<p>I did read your version, but it was almost cut and paste from the original <i>Sunday Times</i> report. However, I don't see how any of it could be liablous.

<p>Hi Andrew. It could be that you still stand by the "oppose" comment at the proposal to rename various MÃ©tro categories, but I've added a note to clarify that all of these categories relate specifically to the Paris MÃ©tro, and not to metro systems in general. If you still oppose the move, then please ignore this comment. However, it may be that you didn't realise that these categories related specifically to the Paris MÃ©tro, in which case you may decide that the move makes sense after all.

<p>Thank you for improving Wikipedia by adding new articles and improving the old ones. It would be even more helpful if you could use guidelines for ref formatting (<a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_messages_Sources_of_articles_c696.html#Citations_of_generic_sources" title="Wikipedia:Template messages/Sources of articles">Wikipedia:Template_messages/Sources_of_articles#Citations_of_generic_sources</a>) to improve quality of your refs.

<dd>Hi Andrew, thank you for your reply on my talk page. I understand why you dislike ref templates and I'm aware that they are not required. I must admit that I'd love to see them required since they guide editors to provide as much detail about source as would be considered automatic in any academic paper. For example you would not forget to include period after every reference f.e. in <a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmad_Masjed-Jamei_d2d0.html" title="Ahmad Masjed-Jamei">Ahmad_Masjed-Jamei</a> article. It might not seem important to you but it is important to maintain standard citations. Also dates wouldn't be linked since they carry no information for the reader (Although retrieved on date is linked, don't asked me why). There s also possibility that one day is some common standard for citations on WP cretated and standard refs then could be automaticaly converted into new form which is not the case with generic styles used by individual editors.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Citation of online news can be well done using&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = | work = | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For example ommission of author name in cited work can be in some countries considered intelectual rights infringement (I'm not sure about U.S.). If nothing else it's a matter of politeness to include name of the author if you are using his work. That's just to demonstrate that those templates are helpful for including as much as possible. It is also important not to place space before refs. And no offense! You're doing great job!--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPethr_1b0f.html" title="User:Pethr">Pethr</a> 01:03, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please go ahead and "block" me, then. That amounts to nothing. Be my guest. I can always approach you from different IP addresses if and when I chose. There are umpteen. While I do admit that some remarks that people add or make here (like my name calling) do constitute a puerile "vandalism", I would say its just venting one's spleen, which is not a crime - especially when its context is understood. That can be seen by any sensible and mature reader. But this doesn't apply to everything. Not especially to sections like the <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pashtun.html" title="Pashtun">Pashtun</a> one you accused me of "vandalising". Wikipedia often harbours inaccurate and watered down or in-authoritative, deliberately falsified descriptions which don't do proper justice to the subject at hand. As far as the Pashtun subject is concerned, it is one that not many people are qualified to comment upon, least of all a punk like you. So I suggest that instead of directing your so-called, typically British patronising tone at me and my edits, you should take an objective look at who you are yourself: some damned punk living on an insignificant little louse of an island off the coast of Europe that has outlived its bloated role in the world, and will soon have to accept that fact, if it doesn't give up its insolent clamour to an importance bigger than itself which it thinks is its right, to foist upon others. Recognise that, and tone down your "proud British" arrogance before it is cut in half by circumstances beyond your puny control... <small>âThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_210.56.25.42_470a.html" title="Special:Contributions/210.56.25.42">210.56.25.42</a> (<a href="../../../2/1/0/User_talk%7E210.56.25.42.html" title="User talk:210.56.25.42">talk</a>) 07:48, 8 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

In respect to anti-bahai input I was merely making the point that the san-Guardian Baha'is exercise a lot of editing in the views and beliefs of groups that they themselves deem as covenant breakers. Being that a C.B. is a stated enemy of their Cause, would they in turn reciprocate and tolerate C.B.'s editing their beliefs. I hope that makes sense.</p>

Thanks for thinking of me first when someone has vandalized a site. I wouldn't bother even editing grammar on a sans-Guadian page, let alone vandalize one. I just got home from work myself, and aren't even sure what specifically has occured. I've spent hours trying to word things more accurately on the pages I am interested in only to have "vandals" with their own agenda revert them back. Reverting vandalism is quite an easy task, so the thought of wasting any time in actually vandalizing something to me seems pointless. BTW, I'm no "Remeyite", whatever that even is. I'm a Baha'i Under the Provisions of the Covenant. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffmichaud_1ead.html" title="User:Jeffmichaud">User:Jeffmichaud</a></p>
<p>No worries, mate. I should apologize for being a bit punchy with you. Please don't take anything I have to say to heart. I've been online for the last 8 years defending the Covenant in my own persoanl way, which has put me in the crosshairs of, well, how do you say...meany-pants people. My skins a little thick at this point, and I've been known to be a little reactionary. You seem like your heart's in the right place, and appear to be a true example of Abdu'l-Baha's counsel of: "Consort with all the peoples, kindreds, and religions of the world with the utmost truthfullness, uprightness, faithfulness, kindliness, good-will and friendliness...". Thanks for reminding me what that looks like.</p>
<p>I guess technically I am a Remeyite, although I've never seen that word before. I've never thought of myself as an "ite" of anything. It made me think of these meanies on AOL message boards a few years back who always would call me and the other BUPC "Jensenites". Whatever. We all worship God in our own ways. Take care:) <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffmichaud_1ead.html" title="User:Jeffmichaud">User:Jeffmichaud</a></p>

<p>Northern League is widely considered a far-right party in Italy. Here are some of their opinions as expressed by their leaders and policies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Umberto Bossi (leader of the party) himself said that African immigrants, whom he called Bingo-bongos, should not receive popular housing paid for with Lombard money.</li>
<li>A minister from this party have argued that boats full of immigrants (mostly black and albanian) should be bombed by the Italian Navy rather than allowing them to set foot in Italy.</li>
<li>In June 2005, at a festival organised by the League, a banner was displayed saying "Rape Pecoraro", (referring to Alfonso Pecoraro Scanio, the openly bisexual secretary of the Federation of the Greens).</li>
<li>In 2005, Mario Borghezio, MP for the League at the European Parliament, was found guilty of arson, for having set on fire the belongings of some immigrants sleeping under a bridge in Turin in 2000.</li>
<li>Their most quoted reasons for seccession are that northerners are of germanic ("lombardic") and not italian stock.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Northern League claims they are not far-right. But their actions speak for themselves. Is this a respectable right wing party for you? 84.90.18.136 22:11, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Jeff is distorting the truth. The page was widely advertised and had a lot of positive response (as noted on the talk page). The issue actually is that he disagrees with the underlying idea (that too many categories are a bad thing), but since this underlying idea is widely accepted, he takes a different approach and claims that the guideline is out of process. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 12:44, 5 February 2007 (UTC) <span id="63296112934"></span></p>

<p>Hi, in the edit summary you ask for references. Could you be a bit more precise?</p>
<p>What I can offer straight away:</p>
<ul>
<li>Beaumont's web site, which offers a list of his publications and the fact that he is married with two children (already linked, s.v. "External links")</li>
<li>The Wikipedia article on <i><a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamie_Kane_a13f.html" title="Jamie Kane">Jamie Kane</a></i>, with 18 items under "References" (should I copy them?)</li>
<li><i><a href="../../../e/_/%28/E_%28novel%29.html" title="E (novel)">e</a></i>, which is (a) comic and (b) epistolary</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_ss_w_h_/026-0034006-0180440?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=Matt+Beaumont&amp;Go.x=10&amp;Go.y=11" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_ss_w_h_/026-0034006-0180440?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=Matt+Beaumont&amp;Go.x=10&amp;Go.y=11" rel="nofollow">amazon's search results</a></li>
<li>Barry Forshaw writing that "the idea of the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/E-Novel-Matt-Beaumont/dp/000710068X/sr=8-3/qid=1170891739/ref=pd_ka_3/026-6819785-5534012?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.co.uk/E-Novel-Matt-Beaumont/dp/000710068X/sr=8-3/qid=1170891739/ref=pd_ka_3/026-6819785-5534012?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">first e-mail novel</a> could have been a disaster but instead is a minor comic triumph." (Note that I modified that a bit because (a) I'm not so sure whether Forshaw is telling the truth or exaggerating / advertising the novel and (b) User:68.226.91.222 claimed <a href="../../../t/w/o/Two_Solitudes_e9a9.html" title="Two Solitudes">here</a> that <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Steadman_a60c.html" title="Carl Steadman">Carl Steadman</a> had written an "e-mail novel" in 1994 and I did not want to contradict them.)</li>
</ul>
<p>What I cannot provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Beaumont's birth or marriage certificates (If I could, I would already have added his date &amp; place of birth)</li>
</ul>
<p>So what exactly would you like me to do?</p>
<p>Any more tags anybody? NPOV? Copyvio? No global perspective?</p>

<p>Hi AndrewRT,</p>
<p>Your arguments, particularly the last contribution, at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_2007_Plot_to_Behead_a_British_Muslim_Soldier_56cc.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/2007 Plot to Behead a British Muslim Soldier">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/2007 Plot to Behead a British Muslim Soldier</a> were the best I've seen for a long time. I've recently been hanging around the deletion pages because I think there are too many editors who constantly contribute to them and are too quick to vote "delete". I hope you'll stick around to keep contributing your good sense. Incidentally, although your last post is clear, I wouldn't label anything "Keep" twice because it makes it more difficult for the administrators toting up votes (even though they're more recommendations than votes, and the decisions aren't settled by arithmetic). Anyway, I hope to see more of your comments in the future. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 18:31, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

And the worse thing is that I am accused by you to create this edit war!! Gerash77 created this edit war. he should leave the page as it was before 9 February 2007 and enter into real discussion.

<dd>I'm not an administrator and I am neutral on whether the topic is included in the template or not. I am not, however, netral on edit warring - it is always unacceptable. If you look at the page history Gerash deleted quite a few links from the template - including some election links that I had added. I am sure it was a good faith attempt to rationalise the template, not an NPOV attack on your addition in particular, and I am also sure that we can come to a mutually agreeable solution by discussion. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewRT_eb6f.html" title="User:AndrewRT">AndrewRT</a>(<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrewRT_58ab.html" title="User talk:AndrewRT">Talk</a>) 11:30, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. The infobox template idea would be good if the references could be maintained. Some of the references are used by other locations in the main article also. So putting the box in a separate template breaks many references, not just the ones in the infobox. I copied the infobox code back into the main <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq_War_58f4.html" title="Iraq War">Iraq War</a> article, and left a copy in the template page.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq_War_58f4.html" title="Iraq War">Iraq War</a> page is very busy, and edited by many people. And viewed by many people. So this problem needs to be fixed before removing the infobox code solely to the template page for transclusion. And there is no room to put a references section in the notes part at the end of the infobox. Space is already at a premium in the infobox. Many discussions over that already. Plus the references in the main article would still be broken.</p>
<p>Please see the template on this page: <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casualties_of_the_conflict_in_Iraq_since_2003_ffa1.html" title="Casualties of the conflict in Iraq since 2003">Casualties of the conflict in Iraq since 2003</a>. I edit both that page and the template on it. Since the template references do not work for using as references in the main article, there are some duplicate references. Click the reference numbers to see what I mean. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshifter_97a3.html" title="User:Timeshifter">Timeshifter</a> 15:41, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've moved the article on <a href="../../../e/l/u/Eluned_Morgan_%28author%29_b81f.html" title="Eluned Morgan (author)">Eluned Morgan</a> and expanded it a bit. I wouldn't have left it so long were it not for the fact I spend most of my time on cy.wikipedia and fr.wikipedia. Cheers. <a href="../../../e/n/a/User%7EEnaidmawr_0f11.html" title="User:Enaidmawr">Enaidmawr</a> 02:15, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
