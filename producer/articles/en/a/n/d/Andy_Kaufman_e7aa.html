<p>Kaufman first caught major attention with a character known as "Foreign Man". Foreign Man, who claimed to be from "Caspiar" (a fictional island in the <a href="../../../c/a/s/Caspian_Sea_ba60.html" title="Caspian Sea">Caspian Sea</a>), would appear on the stage of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comedy_club.html" title="Comedy club">comedy clubs</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/p/Lip-synch.html" title="Lip-synch">lip-synch</a> one line — "Here I come to save the day" — from the theme from "<a href="../../../m/i/g/Mighty_Mouse_5430.html" title="Mighty Mouse">Mighty Mouse</a>", tell a few lame jokes, and perform a number of bad <a href="../../../i/m/p/Impersonator.html" title="Impersonator">impersonations</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/c/Archie_Bunker_d610.html" title="Archie Bunker">Archie Bunker</a>, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Nixon_9d26.html" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>, etc).</p>
<p>For example, he might say in a phony accent, "I would like to imitate Meester <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Carter_64a2.html" title="Jimmy Carter">Carter, de President of de United States</a>." He would then say in the same voice, "Hello, I am Meester Carter, de President of de United States. Thenk you veddy much." The audience would be torn between outrage at seeing such a bad act, and sympathy for the hapless entertainer, who would cry on stage once <a href="../../../h/e/c/Heckled.html" title="Heckled">heckled</a> enough. At that point, Foreign Man would announce "And now I would like to imitate the Elvis Presley," turn around, take off his jacket, slick his hair back, and launch into an <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elvis_Presley_0230.html" title="Elvis Presley">Elvis Presley</a> impersonation so good that Elvis Presley himself described it as his favorite.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The audience would realize they had been tricked, which became a trademark of Kaufman's comedy.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Kaufman_e7aa.html" title="Edit section: &quot;Latka&quot;">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">"Latka"</span></h3>

<p>Kaufman reprised a version of the Foreign Man character, now named Latka<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> Gravas, for <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Broadcasting_Company_349c.html" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a>'s <i><a href="../../../t/a/x/Taxi_%28TV_series%29_18d6.html" title="Taxi (TV series)">Taxi</a></i> <a href="../../../s/i/t/Situation_comedy.html" title="Situation comedy">sitcom</a>, appearing in 114 episodes from <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> The producers of <i>Taxi</i> had seen Andy's Foreign Man act and, according to producer Ed Weinberger, "We weren't considering Andy for the show before we saw him. Then we wrote a part for him." <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Zmuda_e47e.html" title="Bob Zmuda">Bob Zmuda</a> confirms this: "They basically were buying Andy's Foreign Man character for the Taxi character Latka."<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> Andy's long-time manager George Shapiro encouraged Andy to take the gig. "My feeling was that it would be a nice boost for his career... and he would be playing a character that he knew very well, the Foreign Man - this particular character speaks no English in <i>Taxi</i> and his name is Latka Gravas."<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Kaufman hated sitcoms and was not thrilled with the idea of being on one. In order to allow Kaufman to demonstrate some comedic range, his character was given <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multiple_personality_disorder.html" title="Multiple personality disorder">multiple personality disorder</a>, which allowed Kaufman to randomly portray other characters. In one episode, Kaufman's character came down with a condition which made him act like Alex Reiger, the main character played by <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judd_Hirsch_b0c0.html" title="Judd Hirsch">Judd Hirsch</a>. Another such recurring character played by Kaufman was the womanizing "Vic Ferrari".</p>
<p><i>Taxi</i> was an award-winning show with a large audience and Kaufman was widely recognized as Latka. On some occasions, audiences would show up to one of Kaufman's stage performances expecting to see him perform as Latka, and heckling him with demands when he did not. Kaufman would punish these audiences with the announcement that he was going to read <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Great_Gatsby_0702.html" title="The Great Gatsby">The Great Gatsby</a></i> by <a href="../../../f/2E/_/F._Scott_Fitzgerald_ccfe.html" title="F. Scott Fitzgerald">F. Scott Fitzgerald</a> to them. The audience would laugh at this, not realizing that he was serious and would proceed to read the book to them, continuing despite audience members' departure.</p>

<p>Another well-known Kaufman character is "<a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Clifton_e3ea.html" title="Tony Clifton">Tony Clifton</a>", an abusive <a href="../../../l/o/u/Lounge_singer.html" title="Lounge singer">lounge singer</a>. "Clifton" began opening for Kaufman at <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comedy_club.html" title="Comedy club">comedy clubs</a> and eventually even performed concerts on his own around the country. Sometimes it was Kaufman performing as Clifton, sometimes it was his brother Michael or his friend <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Zmuda_e47e.html" title="Bob Zmuda">Bob Zmuda</a>. For a brief time, it was unclear to some that Clifton was not a real person. News programs actually interviewed Clifton as Kaufman's opening act. The interviews would usually turn ugly whenever Kaufman's name came up, because Clifton would claim that Kaufman was using him to get rich.</p>
<p>At Kaufman's insistence, as a requirement for Kaufman's accepting the <i>Taxi</i> offer, "Clifton" was hired for a guest role on <i>Taxi</i>, but after throwing a tantrum on stage, had to be escorted off of the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Broadcasting_Company_349c.html" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a> studio's lot by security guards. Much to Kaufman's delight, this incident was reported in the local newspapers. Latka's wife in the series was named Simka.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the performance, Kaufman invited his "grandmother" to watch the show from a chair he had placed at the side of the stage. At the end of the show, she stood up, took her mask off and revealed to the audience that she was actually <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comedian.html" title="Comedian">comedian</a> <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Williams_a8f4.html" title="Robin Williams">Robin Williams</a> in disguise. Kaufman also had an elderly woman (named Eleanor Cody Gould) appearing to have a heart attack and dying on stage, after which he reappeared on stage wearing a <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States_7838.html" title="Native Americans in the United States">Native American</a> <a href="../../../h/e/a/Headdress.html" title="Headdress">headdress</a> and performed a dance over her body, seeming to revive her.</p>
<p>The performance is most famous for Kaufman ending the show by actually taking the entire audience, in 35 buses, out for milk and cookies. He invited anyone interested to meet him on the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Staten_Island_Ferry_d4df.html" title="Staten Island Ferry">Staten Island Ferry</a> the next morning, where the show continued.</p>
<p>This kind of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Performance_art.html" title="Performance art">performance art</a> - not stand-up comedy - is what Andy Kaufman is most known for besides his role on <i>Taxi</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Kaufman_e7aa.html" title="Edit section: Andy's Funhouse">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Andy's Funhouse</i></span></h3>
<p>Also part of the <i>Taxi</i> deal with ABC was to give Kaufman a television "special". He came up with <i>Andy's Funhouse</i>, based on an old routine he had developed while in college. The special was taped in 1977 but did not air until August 1979, on ABC.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup> It featured most of Andy's famous gags, including Foreign Man/Latka and his Elvis Presley impersonation, as well as a host of unique segments (including a special appearance by children's television character <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howdy_Doody_90d8.html" title="Howdy Doody">Howdy Doody</a> and the "Has-been Corner"). There also was a segment that included fake television screen static as part of the gag, which ABC executives were not comfortable with as they thought viewers would think that ABC was having broadcast trouble and would change the channel - which was the comic element Kaufman wanted to present.</p>
<p><i>Andy's Funhouse</i> was written by Kaufman, Zmuda, and Mel Sherer, with music by Kaufman. Andy considered this perhaps his greatest work.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Kaufman_e7aa.html" title="Edit section: The Fridays incident">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The <i>Fridays</i> incident</span></h3>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>, Kaufman made three appearances<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> on <i><a href="../../../f/r/i/Fridays.html" title="Fridays">Fridays</a></i>, a <a href="../../../v/a/r/Variety_show.html" title="Variety show">variety show</a> on <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Broadcasting_Company_349c.html" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a> that was similar to <i><a href="../../../s/n/l/SNL_5d92.html" title="SNL">SNL</a></i>. Kaufman's first appearance on the show proved to be memorable. During a sketch about four people out on a dinner date who excuse themselves to the restroom to smoke <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannabis_%28drug%29.html" title="Cannabis (drug)">marijuana</a>, Kaufman broke character and refused to say his lines.</p>
<p>The other comedians were embarrassed by the position that Kaufman had put them in on a live television show. In response, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Richards_6ddf.html" title="Michael Richards">Michael Richards</a> walked off camera and returned with a set of cue cards and dumped them on the table in front of Kaufman. Andy responded by splashing Richards with water. Show emcee, comedian <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Burns_0ea5.html" title="Jack Burns">Jack Burns</a> stormed onto the stage, leading to a brawl on camera before the show finally cut away to commercial. The entire incident was a gag conceived by Andy Kaufman, but how many people were in on the joke has never been clear.</p>
<p>Regardless, Kaufman appeared the following week in a videotaped apology to the home viewers. Later that year, Kaufman returned to host <i>Fridays</i>. At one point in the show, he invited a <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawrence_Welk_Show_6902.html" title="Lawrence Welk Show">Lawrence Welk Show</a> gospel and standards singer, <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kathie_Sullivan_13a5.html" title="Kathie Sullivan">Kathie Sullivan</a>, on stage to sing a few gospel songs with him and announced that the two were engaged to be married, then talked to the audience about his newfound faith in <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>.

<p>Kaufman grew up admiring <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional_wrestling.html" title="Professional wrestling">professional wrestlers</a> and the world that they perform in. For a brief time, Kaufman began wrestling women during his act and was the self-proclaimed "Inter-Gender Wrestling Champion of the World". He offered $1,000 reward to any woman who could pin him.</p>
<p>Later, after a challenge from professional wrestler <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Lawler_dc4b.html" title="Jerry Lawler">Jerry "The King" Lawler</a>, Kaufman would step into the ring (in the <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memphis%2C_Tennessee_649e.html" title="Memphis, Tennessee">Memphis</a> wrestling circuit) with a man - Lawler himself. Lawler's ongoing feud with Kaufman included an apparent broken neck for Kaufman as a result of a <a href="../../../p/i/l/Piledriver_%28professional_wrestling%29.html" title="Piledriver (professional wrestling)">piledriver</a> by Lawler, and a famous on-air fight on a 1982 episode of the <i><a href="../../../l/a/t/Late_Night_with_David_Letterman_4521.html" title="Late Night with David Letterman">Late Night with David Letterman</a></i> television show. After that, for some time Kaufman appeared everywhere wearing a neck brace, insisting that his injuries were real. Kaufman would continue to defend the intergender championship in the Mid-South Collesium, and offered an extra prize, other than the $1,000.00, that if he was pinned, the woman who pinned him would get to marry him and that he (Kaufman) would shave his head bald as well.</p>
<p>Kaufman and Lawler's famous feud and wrestling matches were later revealed to have been staged, or a "<a href="../../../w/o/r/Work_%28professional_wrestling%29.html" title="Work (professional wrestling)">work</a>", as the two were actually friends. The truth about it being a work was kept secret for more than 10 years after Kaufman's death, until the Emmy nominated documentary <i>A Comedy Salute to Andy Kaufman</i> aired on <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a> in 1995. Coincidentally, <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Carrey_1cd5.html" title="Jim Carrey">Jim Carrey</a> (who also shares Kaufman´s birthday) is the one who reveals the secret, and would later go on to play Kaufman in the 1999 film <i><a href="../../../m/a/n/Man_on_the_Moon_2254.html" title="Man on the Moon">Man on the Moon</a></i>. In a 1997 interview with the <i>Memphis Flyer</i>, Lawler claimed he had improvised during their first match and the Letterman incident. Although officials at St. Francis Hospital stated that Kaufman's neck injuries were real, in his 2002 biography "It's Good to Be the King...Sometimes," Lawler detailed how they came up with the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angle_%28professional_wrestling%29.html" title="Angle (professional wrestling)">angle</a> and kept it quiet. He also said that Kaufman's explosion on Letterman was the comedian's own idea.</p>

Kaufman did however make one last pre-taped appearance on the show in January 1983 to acknowledge the vote, during which he said that he would honor the audience's decision and stay off the show.</p>

He was initially diagnosed with the disease in December <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>, after several family members at a <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thanksgiving.html" title="Thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a> dinner that year were growing concerned over his persistent <a href="../../../c/o/u/Coughing.html" title="Coughing">coughing</a>. He was committed to fighting the disease from his diagnosis until his death. Despite massive amounts of emergency <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radiotherapy.html" title="Radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>, the cancer had by then spread. His last stand for medical therapy was "<a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychic_surgery.html" title="Psychic surgery">psychic surgery</a>", performed in <a href="../../../b/a/g/Baguio.html" title="Baguio">Baguio</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippines.html" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>.</p>
<p>Because he kept the true nature of his health a secret—almost until the day he died—fans have, over the years, doubted Kaufman's death, thinking that he staged it as the ultimate Andy Kaufman stunt. Rumors that Kaufman was still alive go as far back as May 17, 1984 (the day after he died), when a caller phoned the <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Stern_a7e1.html" title="Howard Stern">Howard Stern</a> radio show on WNBC in New York to announce that Kaufman's death was a hoax. Friends and family said that Andy never smoked, didn't drink regularly, and was also a <a href="../../../v/e/g/Vegetarian.html" title="Vegetarian">vegetarian</a>. At the time, lung cancer was considered very rare for non-smokers to contract, and it is also rare in people under 50. Kaufman himself even said that if he were to fake his death, he would return 20 years later. On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_16.html" title="May 16">May 16</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, his surviving friends threw a 'Welcome Home Andy' party for him.</p>
<p>It was only after Kaufman's death that it was revealed he had a daughter, Maria, who was given up for adoption. She never knew her biological father.</p>

<p>Andy Kaufman allegedly told many people - including Bob Zmuda - that he wished to fake his own death prior to his actual death. This has caused some fans to believe Kaufman is still alive. A screenplay Kaufman was working on at the time of his death was about a character who claimed to have lung cancer and faked his death.</p>
<p>Andy lost his hair around the time of his death. This was believed to be due to cancer treatment; however, and according to the website AndykaufmanLives.com, Andy's girlfriend at the time later claimed to have shaved his head with a razor. Andy's sister also commented after his death that she found it odd that the doctor who diagnosed Andy with cancer had been wearing tennis shoes, sparking debate amongst fans as to whether Andy had paid off an actor friend to pose as a doctor.</p>
<p>There are many such rumors involving Andy's "hoax" death, and the 1999 <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Carrey_1cd5.html" title="Jim Carrey">Jim Carrey</a> film <i><a href="../../../m/a/n/Man_on_the_Moon_2254.html" title="Man on the Moon">Man on the Moon</a></i> even references these rumors by including an open ending in which Andy may or may not still be alive. Bob Zmuda has acknowledged "death hoax" rumors over the years quite tongue-in-cheek, admitting that Andy and he had discussed faking his death at times and that Andy seemed "obsessed with the idea," but he maintains the opinion that Andy truly did die and his death was not faked. Zmuda claims he doesn't think Andy would be cruel enough to go this long without making contact with his family if he were still alive. But he also acknowledged the idea that Kaufman could have faked his death in 1984 and died later of some other cause.</p>
<p>An example of the kind of hoax or joke that has been perpetuated regarding Andy Kaufman's death is a blog that surfaced in 2004, supposedly chronicling Kaufman's return<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[17]</a></sup>. The blog's author was revealed to be Steve Rocco (previously suggested by the <a href="../../../o/c/_/OC_Weekly_3149.html" title="OC Weekly">OC Weekly</a> to be Kaufman himself<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[18]</a></sup>) when a press release claiming to have been issued by Andy's friends and family - among them, Bob Zmuda - was apparently issued by Rocco. Rocco, who manages numerous websites affiliated with Kaufman, and uses numerous aliases on these sites, claims to be in possession of evidence proving once and for all that Kaufman is alive. He has posted some of this evidence - including personal photographs from Kaufman's family album - online. This has led some fans to believe that Rocco is working for Bob Zmuda (who could have some of Kaufman's personal items) and that the website AndyKaufmanLives.com is a "game" of sorts set up to honor Andy and provide his fans with a source of entertainment and as an elaborate gag in honor of the practical jokes he used to play. There are many other clues and "in-jokes" on AndyKaufmanLives.com, some of which are detailed on the OC Weekly website.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>

<p>"I am not a comic, I have never told a joke....The comedian's promise is that he will go out there and make you laugh with him....My only promise is that I will try to entertain you as best I can. I can manipulate people's reactions. There are different kinds of laughter. Gut laughter is where you don't have a choice, you've got to laugh. Gut laughter doesn't come from the intellect. And it's much harder for me to evoke now, because I'm known. They say, 'Oh wow, Andy Kaufman, he's a really funny guy.' But I'm not trying to be funny. I just want to play with their heads."</p>
