<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Neil_eb23.html" title="Edit section: Early life and career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life and career</span></h2>
<p>The son of a professional soldier who had worked his way up through the ranks, Neil was educated at <a href="../../../p/a/i/Paisley_Grammar_School_5693.html" title="Paisley Grammar School">Paisley Grammar School</a> and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Glasgow_4a0a.html" title="University of Glasgow">University of Glasgow</a> where he edited the student newspaper the <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow_University_Guardian_6c49.html" title="Glasgow University Guardian">Glasgow University Guardian</a>. He graduated with an <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_MA_a3fa.html" title="Scottish MA">MA</a> in politics. After graduation he briefly worked as sports correspondent for the local newspaper the <i><a href="../../../p/a/i/Paisley_Daily_Express_c383.html" title="Paisley Daily Express">Paisley Daily Express</a></i> before working for the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29_3ac1.html" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservative Party</a> as a research assistant and then joined <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Economist_bbe2.html" title="The Economist">The Economist</a></i> as a correspondent in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a>. He was later promoted to being the editor of the publication's section on Britain, before his time at <a href="../../../r/u/p/Rupert_Murdoch_2da1.html" title="Rupert Murdoch">Rupert Murdoch</a>'s <i>Sunday Times</i>; he was Editor of the newspaper from <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a> until <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>.</p>
<p>His editorship was controversial. Neil, it was argued, was appointed over more experienced colleagues, such as <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugo_Young_a534.html" title="Hugo Young">Hugo Young</a>. <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sunday_Times_%28UK%29_b3d9.html" title="The Sunday Times (UK)">The Sunday Times</a></i> during this period promoted a fringe and later discredited argument that, in Africa, <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_b1c7.html" title="AIDS">AIDS</a> was a quite separate condition from <a href="../../../h/i/v/HIV_abc5.html" title="HIV">HIV</a>. Opposition to perceived <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_school_%28UK%29_5c32.html" title="Public school (UK)">public school</a> and <a href="../../../o/x/b/Oxbridge.html" title="Oxbridge">Oxbridge</a> attitudes were a hallmark of Neil's <i>Sunday Times</i> editorship, but unusually he criticised such attitudes from a <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Right_36d7.html" title="New Right">New Right</a> starting point rather than a <a href="../../../l/e/f/Left-wing.html" title="Left-wing">left-wing</a> one, which has led some to perceive him as a quintessential <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Wiener_03b1.html" title="Martin Wiener">Wienerite</a>. During his editorship he was also responsible for the revelation that <a href="../../../c/e/c/Cecil_Parkinson_3488.html" title="Cecil Parkinson">Cecil Parkinson's</a> secretary (and mistress), <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sara_Keays_73c4.html" title="Sara Keays">Sara Keays</a>, was pregnant with his child. Parkinson, then a rising Conservative cabinet minister, was forced to resign. The two men were actually old friends; Neil had shared a flat with Parkinson when he first began working in London.</p>
<p>The newspaper also lost a libel case over claims it had made concerning a witness interviewed in the <i><a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_on_the_Rock_5f34.html" title="Death on the Rock">Death on the Rock</a></i> documentary on the <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Flavius_9c12.html" title="Operation Flavius">Gibraltar shootings</a>. Neil won a second defamation case when he sued Sir <a href="../../../p/e/r/Peregrine_Worsthorne_a8d6.html" title="Peregrine Worsthorne">Peregrine Worsthorne</a> over claims that he was unfit to edit a serious newspaper following the Bordes case (see below). Neil won £1000 and costs.</p>
<p><a name="Sky" id="Sky"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Neil_eb23.html" title="Edit section: Sky">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Sky</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a> he also became founding chairman of <a href="../../../s/k/y/Sky_TV_056a.html" title="Sky TV">Sky TV</a>, also part of Murdoch's <a href="../../../n/e/w/News_Corporation_d115.html" title="News Corporation">News Corporation</a>. Neil was instrumental in the company's launch, overseeing the transformation of a down market, single channel satellite service into a four channel network in less than a year. Neil and Murdoch stood side by side at Sky's new headquarters in west London on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_5.html" title="February 5">February 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a> to witness the launch of the service at 18.00. Sky was not an instant success, the uncertainty caused by the competition provided by <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Satellite_Broadcasting_6de2.html" title="British Satellite Broadcasting">British Satellite Broadcasting</a> (BSB) and the initial shortage of satellite dishes were early problems.</p>
<p>The failure of BSB in November 1990 led to a merger, although few programmes acquired by BSB found their way to Sky One and BSB's satellites were sold. The new company was called <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Sky_Broadcasting_9a1d.html" title="British Sky Broadcasting">British Sky Broadcasting</a> (BSkyB). The merger may have saved Sky financially; despite its popularity, Sky had very few major advertisers to begin with, and was also beginning to suffer from embarrassing breakdowns. Acquiring BSB's healthier advertising contracts and equipment apparently solved these problems. BSkyB would not make a profit for a decade but is now one of the most profitable and successful television companies in Europe.</p>

<p>He eventually parted company with Murdoch on bad terms and became a writer for the <i><a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Mail_c8b4.html" title="Daily Mail">Daily Mail</a></i>. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a> he became editor-in-chief of the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barclay_brothers.html" title="Barclay brothers">Barclay brothers</a> Press Holdings group of newspapers, owner of <i>The Scotsman</i>, <i><a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunday_Business_1efb.html" title="Sunday Business">Sunday Business</a></i> (now just <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Business_%28magazine%29_c563.html" title="The Business (magazine)">The Business</a></i>) and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_European_6b43.html" title="The European">The European</a></i>. Neil has not enjoyed great success with the circulations of the newspapers (indeed <i>The European</i> folded shortly after he took over).</p>
<p>As well as Neil's newspaper activities he has also maintained a television career. While working at <i>The Economist</i> he provided news reports, for example to American networks. When at <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sunday_Times_%28UK%29_b3d9.html" title="The Sunday Times (UK)">The Sunday Times</a></i> he contributed to BBC radio and television as well as commenting on the various controversies provoked by the paper in his role as Editor. During the 1990s Neil fronted political programmes for the BBC, notably <i>Despatch Box</i> on <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Two_4086.html" title="BBC Two">BBC Two</a>. Following the revamp of the BBC's political programming in early 2003 Neil has been the presenter of the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_One_5f6f.html" title="BBC One">BBC One</a> weekly political roundup show, <i><a href="../../../t/h/i/This_Week_%28BBC%2C_UK%29_f8af.html" title="This Week (BBC, UK)">This Week</a></i>, and co-presenter of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Daily_Politics_693e.html" title="The Daily Politics">The Daily Politics</a></i> which broadcasts every day that Parliament sits. In November 2004 it was announced that Neil was to become Chief Executive of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Spectator_0701.html" title="The Spectator">The Spectator</a></i>. Neil served as Lord Rector of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_St_Andrews_7dcc.html" title="University of St Andrews">University of St Andrews</a> from 1999 - 2002.</p>

The "Private Eye" image</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Neil is not married. A photograph of him dressed in a vest and baseball cap, embracing a much younger woman, ran over several consecutive editions of satirical magazine <i><a href="../../../p/r/i/Private_Eye_4f62.html" title="Private Eye">Private Eye</a></i>, after it became known that he found the picture embarrassing. It still surfaces periodically, on the flimsiest of excuses. The photograph is apparently of a woman Neil was briefly involved with while in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_of_America_8a5e.html" title="United States of America">United States</a> in the early nineties <a href="http://www.bjr.org.uk/data/2005/no2_riddell.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bjr.org.uk/data/2005/no2_riddell.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and is frequently accompanied in the paper by jokes about the woman's ethnicity. Neil has found "fascinating" what he sees as an example of "public school racism" on the part of the <i>Eye'</i>s editorial staff.</p>
<p>The magazine has also <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nickname.html" title="Nickname">nicknamed</a> him <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brillo_pad.html" title="Brillo pad">Brillo Pad</a>, after his rather wiry hair, often mistaken for a toupe, which is said to resemble a scouring pad. In addition, it often misspells his surname with an extra L - which also annoys him - in memory of Neil's affair with the former <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_India_fa6f.html" title="Miss India">Miss India</a> <a href="../../../p/a/m/Pamella_Bordes_5d4f.html" title="Pamella Bordes">Pamella Bordes</a>, whose name is also written with an unusual number of Ls. Whilst at <i>The Sunday Times</i>, he met Bordes, who the <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/News_of_the_World_22c3.html" title="News of the World">News of the World</a></i> suggested was an up-market prostitute, in a nightclub in 1988. This led to Neil bringing a libel action against Sir <a href="../../../p/e/r/Peregrine_Worsthorne_a8d6.html" title="Peregrine Worsthorne">Peregrine Worsthorne</a> following an article he wrote in <i>The Sunday Telegraph</i> in which it was asserted that he was not fit to edit a Sunday newspaper. Neil won £1,000 and costs. A much commented-upon revelation from Bordes was that Neil's hair-dye stained the pillow-cases.</p>
<p>Neil often castigates the British establishment, many of whom he deems to be <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politically_correct.html" title="Politically correct">politically correct</a> but snobbish or ethnically-biased in their perceptions. Teaming up on <a href="../../../t/h/i/This_Week_%28BBC_One_TV_series%29_743d.html" title="This Week (BBC One TV series)">This Week</a>, the BBC One programme he presents, with Tory ex-leadership candidate and maverick, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Portillo_d4dc.html" title="Michael Portillo">Michael Portillo</a>, and leftwing <a href="../../../h/a/c/Hackney_North_and_Stoke_Newington_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_afe8.html" title="Hackney North and Stoke Newington (UK Parliament constituency)">Hackney</a> MP, <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diane_Abbott_ea4f.html" title="Diane Abbott">Diane Abbott</a>, (an improbable combination, though the chemistry seems to work well, probably as a result of their long friendship begun when Abbott played <a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_Macbeth_951c.html" title="Lady Macbeth">Lady Macbeth</a> to Portillo's <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macbeth.html" title="Macbeth">Macbeth</a> when they were still at school) has helped to soften his image and widen his appeal after he was judged unsuitable to present the BBC's flagship news programme <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/Newsnight.html" title="Newsnight">Newsnight</a></i>.</p>
