He does <b>NOT</b> have the credebilllity nor the credentials of a scholar adn would only repeat: Kill.... or Killl them in self defense, so again while technically it might qualify as a Fatwa, even though nobody asked him for it usually, there are 1.3 Billion Muslims on earth, some of them would atack his opinion or things like that. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Brain_78a8.html" title="User:The Brain">The Brain</a> 20:43, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, Marsden has removed the information about ski resorts that you added to the article, and now he's threatened to report me for "vandalism" for restoring it to the article. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 08:04, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Andjam, if you were to put the ski resort information in the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golan_Heights_4b58.html" title="Golan Heights">Golan Heights</a> article, it would belong. In an article about the Occupied Territrories, it is cr**, and it is a minor edit to remove it. Do you think the ski resort is germane to the occupation? Then surely you can see why it doesn't belong. Jay restored it -- saying, by the way, that it was "as material as the water cr**," in case you're keeping track of who has called one of your contributions "cr**" -- because he wants to make a joke of the whole article. Why did you put it there in the first place? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarsden_5360.html" title="User:Marsden">Marsden</a> 14:10, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>But Andjam, your ski resort edit was cr**. That's not a personal attack; it's a simple statement of opinion, and one that I think almost all reasonable people will agree with. Please don't make empty threats against me ever again -- it makes you look desperate and stupid more than anything else. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarsden_5360.html" title="User:Marsden">Marsden</a> 15:03, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>By the way, I'll begin a vandalism complaint against you if you re-insert the ski resort cr** without producing an independent source that names it as a consideration in Israel's continued occupation of the Golan Heights. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarsden_5360.html" title="User:Marsden">Marsden</a> 15:11, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The reason why CNN and BBC almost every day have news about things that have happened in the Occupied Territories or in the negotiations about them <b>is not because of a ski resort in the Golan Heights</b>.

<p>I remembered only one person who announced that he had followed the RfC in, left one comment, and then apparently thought better of it and left. I didn't realize that you also had followed the RfC in. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarsden_5360.html" title="User:Marsden">Marsden</a> 00:57, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Would you clarify that your comment to me had to do with the accuracy of my recounting of the dispute resolution, and not with my statement, which is very particularly something else? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarsden_5360.html" title="User:Marsden">Marsden</a> 01:02, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Not at all. There are two main sections that I wrote at the RfAr: one is the "Confirmation that other steps in dispute resolution have been tried" section, which included my comment that the RfC brought in only one editor. This, you have told me, is incorrect, and I changed it.</p>
<p>However, the other section that I wrote was the "Statement by Marsden" section, which includes my statement of the dispute to be arbitrated. You have not indicated any disagreement with anything I wrote in this section, although I certainly encourage you to do so if you think I am in error.</p>
<p>The comment that you added reads, "I've questioned on Marsden's talk page the factual accuracy of his <i>statement</i>." This suggests that you have disagreed with the "Statement by Marsden" section as opposed to with the "Confirmation that other steps in dispute resolution have been tried" section, which is not what you noted on my talk page.</p>
<p>It's not a big deal, but I think it would avoid some confusion if you made clear that you had questioned my dispute resolution history and not my statement of the conflict.</p>

<p>Andjam, my direct reason for filing the RfAr are exactly as stated: SlimVirgin abused her administrator's priviledges. I think El C, Jayjg, and Raul654 also abused their administrator's priviledges when they blocked me on other occasions, but between having an obvious case and the time to deal with it, SlimVirgin drew the short straw with me.</p>
<p>Beyond the direct reason, however, are a couple of other things. In the first place, some people -- and SlimVirgin possibly foremost among them -- have adopted an elitist attitude about Wikipedia, including freely throwing about epithets and then claiming that the same words when used against them or their favored few ("editors in good standing") are personal attacks. And she has been, even if you can't see it, awfully abusive and harassing of me and of other newer editors who don't buy into her way of seeing things. The result of this is to make Wikipedia a closed project, where its systemic biases -- whether pro-Israeli or whatever -- get re-inforced rather than challenged and corrected.</p>
<p>Basically, though, I am giving Wikipedia an ultimate opportunity to demonstrate what it is about: I don't see that there's very much room for interpretation in the arbitration, and if the Arbitration Committee screws it up anyway, that would demonstrate to me that there's no real hope for Wikipedia.</p>

<li>I wish to categorically state that an unsuccessful attempt to meet Rebecca in real life did not influence my behaviour towards her. I have had disputes with her before and after the attempt to meet her in real life.</li>
<li>In the past, I used to warn Rebecca for what I regarded as incivil comments towards people other than me. I have no interest in doing so any more.</li>
<li>I complained about an edit summary I found incivil the day that I noticed it. I was not storing my complaint for a strategic time, even though the edit summary was months old. I shall avoid complaining about old edit summaries in future.</li>
<li>In future, I shall try to avoid communicating with Rebecca via her talk page (and I'll won't use email either).</li>
