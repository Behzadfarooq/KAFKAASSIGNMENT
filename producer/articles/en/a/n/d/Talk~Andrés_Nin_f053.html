Less than a week later Nin disappeared from prison. An official investigation announced that he had escaped. In reality, he was abducted and murdered by a 'mobile squad' of assassins, supervised by Orlov. Nin was one of many Trotskyists in Spain, both real and imagined, who met such fates." The NKVD did not carry out such activities without direct sanction from Stalin. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> Trotboy (<a href="../../../t/r/o/User_talk%7ETrotboy_842a.html" title="User talk:Trotboy">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Trotboy_3c95.html" title="Special:Contributions/Trotboy">contribs</a>) 28 Dec 2005.</small></p>

<dd>I gather that the "Mitrokhin Archive", while unofficial, is consdered generally reliable. It is an appropriate citation for the NKVD having been responsible for Nin's death. While I agree that it is likely that "the NKVD did not carry out such activities without direct sanction from Stalin", I don't think that's a proven case. If you argue that all NKVD killings were on direct orders from Stalin, then <i>under direct orders from <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalin.html" title="Stalin">Stalin</a> and the supervision of the <a href="../../../n/k/v/NKVD_9ef5.html" title="NKVD">NKVD</a></i> becomes redundant; surely we aren't going to reiterate this every time we say the NKVD killed someone. Shouldn't it just read "Andrés Nin was murdered under the supervision of the <a href="../../../n/k/v/NKVD_9ef5.html" title="NKVD">NKVD</a>" and be cited to Mitrokhin, since that's what we've actually got? -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 00:52, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The Mitrokhin Archive is not really ever going to be 'official', is it? That would mean the Russian Secret Service publicly admitting it was responsible for a whole series of Murders, which is about as likely as the CIA admitting to genocide in Vietnam. The NKVD were responsible for a lot of murders, but Historically only a few of them are highly significant, the murder of Nin, as with the murder of Trotsky, was extremely significant and high profile - it is important therefore to understand that such murders were directly sanctioned by Stalin, and if one doesn't say so, how can this be understood by anyone who doesn't have extensive knowledge of the period &amp; events? <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 82.153.126.144 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.153.126.144_9206.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.153.126.144">contribs</a>) 9 Dec 2006.</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>From the Gorbachev era on, the Soviets and, later, Russians, have admitted to many such things from their history, and many parts of the NKVD/KGB archives have been opened. As I say above, the "Mitrokhin Archive", while unofficial, is consdered generally reliable. But I don't believe it's Mitrokhin as the source for the claim that Nin's murder required Stalin's specific signoff. As I said, Mitrokhin is a good citation for NKVD being responsible, but not for Stalin personally. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 02:08, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
Yes, <b>but Orlov's papers ARE official and recognized</b> by Russian scholars everywhere. That they are at the Mitrokhin Archive is not of importance. Orlov's confirms the orders given. --David Walters, January 1, 2007</p>
<dl>
<dd>That seems a non-sequitur. The citation given is Mitrokhin, not Orlov. And the "Mitrokhin Archive" is not a place, it is simply the title given to Mitrokhin's notes, ostensibly based on primary source materials that are not available.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Again, no reasonable person doubts that Nin died at the hands of the Communists, nor that Stalin is ultimately responsible for the NKVD's murderous policies in this period. But the claim that Stalin specifically authorized this individual killing, as far as I can tell, is just Mitrokhin's claim, and should be identified as such. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 01:20, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the title of the article should be corrected, replacing "Andrés Nin" by "Andreu Nin". “Andrés” is the Spanish version of the Catalan name “Andreu”, and Nin was, after all, Catalan. The Catalan and Spanish versions of Wikipedia have the title entry with "Andreu", not with "Andrés". Even the Foundation of Nin, publishing its texts ins Spanish, is called "Fundación Andreu Nin" (see <a href="http://www.fundanin.org" class="external free" title="http://www.fundanin.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.fundanin.org</a>). I wanted to change the title myself, but I didn’t want to do it without at least posting on the discussion page, because I think changing the title of an article is something not light.

<dd>I support that move. I was not sure of that initially, as I had never heard a reference to him in Catalan, but I did link him as Andreu Nin in all mentions of him in other articles. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 14:29, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks Dahn. I tried to move the page myself but it didn't work (probably something to do with redirecting). So I have added a move request at the administrators site.--<a href="../../../h/v/i/User%7EHvitlys_3353.html" title="User:Hvitlys">Hvitlys</a> 23:00, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strongly Oppose</b>: Nin never called himself Andreu, but Andrés. This is the name he always used to introduce himself. Wikipedia should stick to the most commonly used name in English, and that is Andrés (i.e. Orwell's works). Just because the Spanish and Catalan language articles have been taken over by nationalists, this does not mean we should follow the pattern. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAsterion_ed2e.html" title="User:Asterion">Asterion</a> 16:58, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have just checked progress on the discussion about the name of the article and have seen that, while I was doing research on the topic, the issue has already been closed.</p>
<p>I am really sad that my proposal has caused such comments, especially the last "Strongly oppose". I have never tried to manipulate anything, and I am the first person who is wishing to accept a mistake if I have made one. This kind of comments discourage me to contribute anything to wikipedia; I know it is a stupid attitude, to give up if I think the facts prove otherwise on a topic, but I can’t help feeling disappointed.</p>
<p>Next, I’m posting the procedures and results of my research.</p>
<p>Since I am personally no expert on Andreu Nin or on history, I searched for the right expert. I was addressed to historian Pelai Pagès, the expert Professor on Andreu Nin at the University of Barcelona. He has also appeared recently in a documentary about POUM (<a href="http://www.tvcatalunya.com/p30minuts/30Item.jsp?idint=982&amp;item=reportatges" class="external text" title="http://www.tvcatalunya.com/p30minuts/30Item.jsp?idint=982&amp;item=reportatges" rel="nofollow">30 minuts, POUM: Una vida per la utopia, 4 December 2005</a>).</p>
<p>I asked Professor Pagès what exactly was the name of Nin: Andrés or Andreu. Also, I asked him how people called him. And finally, how I could find out what exactly his name was. Also, I referred to Orwell’s usage of Spanish on Hommage to Catalonia.</p>
<p>This was his answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Context: The majority of POUM members were Catalan. Something different is the name Nin used when he wrote: when he was writing books or articles in Spanish, he signed Andrés Nin, and when he was writing them in Catalan, he signed Andreu Nin. Prof. Pagès points out that this was what people did at that time. Furthermore, Prof. Pagès said that he had met many former fellows of Nin: they called him Andreu if they were Catalan, and Andrés if they were Spanish.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>About today: On today’s situation, Prof. Pagès said that the former was not the question of debate. He said that, for example, <a href="http://www.fundanin.org" class="external text" title="http://www.fundanin.org" rel="nofollow">Fundación Andreu Nin</a> has its central headquarters in Madrid but never occurred itself to call itself otherwise than ”Andreu Nin”. Moreover, Prof. Pagès added that the majority of Nin books that were published again in the seventies, regardless of the language they were written in, were published as ”Andreu Nin”.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>About Orwell’s use of Spanish: originally, I thought Orwell used Spanish in his book because he strongly opposed any form of nationalism; if it had been so, that would not have been fair from him. But Prof. Pagès suggests otherwise: that Orwell’s use of Spanish instead of Catalan was most probably due to bilingual confusion (Catalan and Spanish were spoken in Catalonia, at that time) rather than to a deliberate will of translating everything into Spanish - just to present a one-sided reality. Prof. Pagès explains that confusion among foreigners was extremely common about what Catalan was and what Spanish was; especially, because what was common then was to address all foreigners in Spanish and not in Catalan (something that still occurs today). That would be fair.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, Prof. Pagès said we should be extremely careful about certain attitudes and how we interpret history.</p>
<p>In any case, the same as I am ready to correct any of my mistakes, I think we should try not to politicise wikipedia just because one might be antinationalist, another, nationalist, someone else, catholic, etc. Here I have tried to obtain the most objective facts possible from the expert on the issue.--<a href="../../../h/v/i/User%7EHvitlys_3353.html" title="User:Hvitlys">Hvitlys</a> 15:35, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
