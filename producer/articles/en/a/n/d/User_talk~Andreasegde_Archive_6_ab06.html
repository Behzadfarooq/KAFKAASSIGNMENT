<dd>Not sure what this is supposed to show -- at most it shows that McCartney (along with most of the rest of the world, no doubt) wants a definite article to be used with "Beatles." It doesn't say anything about whether that definite article should be capitalized. It's actually kind of funny (and doesn't particularly advance the Big T argument) that Barry Miles, in transcribing that very same interview with Paul, uses Little T (see the fifth word following): <i>When she referred to the Beatles, she called them "Beatles."</i> McTavidge 05:17, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A friend has tried to get a GCSE course work book but she's had no luck, it's bloody half term! BUT she has a degree in English, and this is (only) her take on it: The problem is arising because the <i>definte article</i> ie <i>the</i> has been used as part of a <i>name</i> <i>The Beatles</i>. If you were <i>Jimmy Jones</i>, and you had a son who you decided to name <i>The</i>, his name would always have to be <i>The</i> Jones, never <i>the</i> Jones, because it is his <i>name</i>. Any good or shall we go with the vote? <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVera%2C_Chuck_%26_Dave_abb3.html" title="User:Vera, Chuck &amp; Dave">Vera, Chuck &amp; Dave</a> 18:31, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sounds good to me, but we'll have to get a bit more than that. I'll look through my copy of "The Elements of Style".

<p>Sorry, that doesn't work. The <i>the</i> in <i>the Beatles</i> is an article; the <i>The</i> in the name you mention, <i>The Jones,</i> is not an article, it is a noun. --<a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukobe_9277.html" title="User:Lukobe">Lukobe</a> 21:54, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Currently my favorate underrated Beatles song (for some reason, there, it is just Beatles rather than "the" or "The" or "THE!!"). The piano, guitar and bass riffs are all fantastically groovy and creepy and roll along with each other brilliantly. I think it's about John re-assuruing Paul "you're a fucking idiot, but I'm your mate and I'll stand by you" (which is actually a Right Said Fred song) - a lesson that we can all learn from (your all fucking idiots arguing over the letter "T" but at the end of the day, you are good for wikipedia and I will argue with Americans til I'm blue in the face for you, regardless of whether I agree with - or even understand - your point).

<dd>I have to say I did not follow much of the above, I think you lot are talking in scouse or something.... that said, I wonder if I dare say anything here? I've found WP tends to take the view that it doesn't care about wishes with respect to how to capitalise/spell/pronounce/title things, even of folk as prominent as Macca. Cf. <a href="../../../l/e/g/LEGO_045a.html" title="LEGO">LEGO</a> which is merely a redirect for <a href="../../../l/e/g/Lego.html" title="Lego">Lego</a>, despite The LEGO Group wanting it spelt in all caps. That Said I think The is right, personally, but despair of prevailing sans some style guides or at least some consistent cites where it is used that way that show preponderance of usage. As for collusion here? as if. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 21:14, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Last Wednesday I paid £2 for a cup of "Russian Caravan" tea. It just tasted like normal tea - not a hint of vodka-stained formica. What a fuckin' rip off, I've got normal tea at home! Tetley tea (though that may also be misleading if you were expecting an ale-flavoured tea). So, in conclusion, I totally understand how you can be confused by tea.--<a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECrestville_26d9.html" title="User:Crestville">Crestville</a> 17:51, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, firstly you're not meant to put milk in Russian Caravan but no one told me that so I made a tea-related faux-pas. Opinion is divided on the "milk first" rule - some people are adamnet that a <i>proper</i> cup of tea is not complete unless the milk has been put in fist. Other refuse to drink tea unless the milk is the final addition. Both claim their method enhances the taste. I, personally, believe this to be the height of bullshit and can find no discernable scientific explaination for the phenominon, other than a deeply ingrained desire to pretend then know something about tea. I put the milk in first purely because if you do it while the kettle is boiling it saves time. And I'm Northern so you know it makes sense.--<a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECrestville_26d9.html" title="User:Crestville">Crestville</a> 12:42, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>People put the milk in first because the ceramic quality was so low that the hot tea would crack the cups. Tah-daa! Ever tried boiling an egg and then putting a tea bag in the pan just before it's ready? Saves time, water, electricity and you do two things at once.

<p>Thanks a lot guys, but there really is no point at all in finding references when the policy is decided by someone else = "a smaller group of people." We could go at this until we are blue in the face, but it would have no effect. This problem will keep cropping up for ever and ever, so I'll just go back to getting poor old <a href="../../../m/a/l/Mal_Evans_db0e.html" title="Mal Evans">Mal Evans</a> ready for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_The_Beatles#Status_board" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_The_Beatles#Status_board" rel="nofollow">GA</a>, and then have a good, long, hard think about doing something else...</p>
<p>BTW, if any editors want to look at the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_style_f2a6.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of style">Wikipedia:Manual of style</a>, you will find that there is <i>not one single book</i> referenced - not one. I find that outrageous, after we are constantly admonished about in-line citations. (I was guilty of putting far too many in on the Macca page.) We can not argue with a style manual that we can not disagree with - having no references to prove its point - and are constantly thwarted by being told that our references do not comply with the consensus, which is decided by a minority of higher (self-elected) mortals than ourselves. In effect, we're stuffed.</p>

I'm not sure if he can really qualify as management, but it seems a bit harsh to relegate him to related articles. I'm slightly wary of tampering with the template though, as it appears on virtually all Beatles-related pages.

<p>I noted your preference for small images and then saw some images you changed to 100px (I think; eyes and rest of body are getting tired so I could be mistaken). On my screen, that means images are quite small and the average image looks like an icon, not an image, if you know what I mean. Why not expand on that a bit, say to 100px or (gasp!) 200px? Done properly, graphics can help the overall appearance of the page. I know larger versions are available by clicking the image, but that doesn't help the article page.

<dd>You have a point, John Cardinal. I think 150 to 200 is OK, but when they get bigger they start to take over the article. I even once made one 250px on the Macca page, BTW, after I was told to sort my rectum out by one disgruntled photographer who had uploaded his own photograph. Anyway, as long as they're evenly spaced and don't crowd each other, then do as you think fit. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasegde_c4ec.html" title="User:Andreasegde">ThE bEaTLeS aka andreasegde</a> 13:18, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello to you as well - I saw you on GA<b>C</b> with Mal Evans, and good luck in getting that to GA. Ever thought of directing your attention to Pete Best or Stuart Sutcliffe? I wouldn't have thought their pages get much attention from the cruft inserters of Wikipedia, which means you won't really be disturbed.</p>
<p>Another thing; has peer review helped with Mimi Smith?</p>
<p>And another thing; ever thought of doing up some Beatles song articles? There's many layouts you could go for with such an article - I favour the one I've gone for with <i><a href="../../../e/y/e/Eyes_of_the_Insane_f545.html" title="Eyes of the Insane">Eyes of the Insane</a></i>.</p>

<p>It just gets on my tits that a minorty of people just want to and are <i>allowed</i> to win an argument and you just <i>know</i> that they really don't give a flying fart {or know anything of substance) about <b>The</b> Beatles! This Wikipedia is really a very strange place, I'm going to have to think long and hard about making any more conributions. At this precise moment in time, I feel that it's a futile exercise - in time to come, you just know that "Marv Beetle, Hank Beetle, Chip Beetle and Wacky Beetle were born in California, deplaned in London town and all dove into the River Liverpool!" Then, they'll start punctuating James Joyce!</p>

<dd>This is a great little trick that will make you enemies of former friends and colleagues... Find female (to taste) with whom you are friends. Comment that you have a skill of mind control that results in you making her breasts jiggle without touching them. Say that you are so sure you can, without physical contact, make her breasts jiggle that you will wager £5.00 (or other similar amount). Once they agree (always the trickiest part) start staring intently into their eyes; if they start giggling protest that they are making it difficult as giggling imparts motion to the chest area and the results may be disputed. Once they realise you are serious and are able to hold themselves still you then reach out and molest them claiming "That is worth a fiver!". <a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 23:03, 6 March 2007 (UTC) This is unlikely to help your defence in a court case, you do realise?</dd>

<dd>Take a break. Don't even look at WP (or at least A Certain Project) for a while. It is only the arrogant and stupid who don't sometimes get peeved off about it (Duh, Hi, My name is Mark and I have only missed 2 days...). You can be certain that should you step back, and then decide to have another go at it that there will be plenty of stuff to do upon your return.</dd>
<dd>If you can't exactly let go then there are two alternatives; one is find a different subject to amuse yourself (although you will likely find the same frustrations, but in a different context) and the opther is to go to some of the Wikipedia pages (like <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28policy%29_070f.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)">Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)</a>) and try to influence how WP works... it is quite refreshing when somebody treats your opinions like a reasonable human being, even when they disagree with you. It certainly widened my appreciation of the overall picture.</dd>
<dd>Basically, if you aren't having fun then best find a way to rediscover the joy. Do whatever it takes. <a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">Mark</a> 00:03, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I thank you kind sir, and I will contemplate your words. I still enjoy it, but I'm getting irritated by the politics. There is no way around that, as they will always be there. I had a lot of fun on the "small people" pages, as I was left alone. It was a shock to start on Eppys page and be brought back into the world of bickering, especially since we all had a good thing going on Macca. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasegde_c4ec.html" title="User:Andreasegde">andreasegde</a> 08:39, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I trust whatever you think is reasonable for the Triv page. Maybe it was [expletive deleted] as they say, but who knows?

<dd>I think it's better than having to fight against deletion every month, and better than actual deletion although <i>that</i> was. It can still be worked on, it can even be moved back into main space at some point, anything is possible&#160;:) The reason I thought it not a bad idea is that Vinoir and I did the same with <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_The_KLF_Additional_Communicators_ecc8.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject The KLF/Additional Communicators">Wikipedia:WikiProject The KLF/Additional Communicators</a> which we didn't know what to do with... there's talk of making that into the basis of a new article now, so maybe the same can happen.

<p>I know exactly what it is that I have been missing: a good belly-laugh. I miss the wonderful humour of Crestville, Vera, Less heard, Kingboyk, Tvoz and others. This is my fault, as I have been digging deeper and deeper into articles that require a GA, and I forgot my own sense of humour. I think I left it on a bench in the park – if anyone finds it, please send it to Blue Peter, BBC, London, on a self-addressed/stamped postcard.</p>
<p>I will now stand back and start laughing at myself - “cos that’s the way to go, bro” (how could I have forgotten that?) Could somebody now please give me a totally stupid and completely irrational Barnstar for being too serious? (I promise not to lend it to my neighbour so he can plug his leaky drainpipe with it – honest). I shall now throw away my shovel (the “digging my own grave” project was coming along nicely, BTW). <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasegde_c4ec.html" title="User:Andreasegde">andreasegde</a> 18:59, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I suggest a good long hot soak in a bath with the partner of your choice (preferably with someone whom you are in love with). It always helps me, and it could be good for you as well. I am here because I love improving the/The Beatles articles from Start/B-Class to GA. Why are you here, exactly? Please don't answer that, because it would be a waste time for us both.
