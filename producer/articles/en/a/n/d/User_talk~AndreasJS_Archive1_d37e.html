<p>Welcome to Wikipedia! (and how come nobody told you that before?) Since you are doing great, I won't spam your talk page with bunch of links. Thanks for taking interest in COA. Yes, things should be standartized, but no one seems to have patience to do this. But be bold and do it yourself. So far I see a very promising beginning! <a href="../../../r/e/n/User%7ERenata3_94d8.html" title="User:Renata3">Renata3</a> 00:00, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ancient Greek pronunciation</span></h2>
<p>Thank you for visiting <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greek_pronunciation_ca99.html" title="Ancient Greek pronunciation">Ancient Greek pronunciation</a>. We all know about Vox Graeca. Our problem is that User:Thrax disputes the relevance of this work although it is considered a standard text. In particular, Thrax tries to convince Wikipedia readers that Greek linguists as a whole share his opinion that the mediae were fricatives already in archaic times etc. What we would need is reference to Greek sources regarding the classical pronounciation of classical Attic Greek, in particular the consonants. Apart from scolarly works in Greek, this would also include contributions of Greek linguists in international scientific journals and at international conferences that cover the subject of classical Greek phonology. <a href="../../../%CE%B1/%CE%BD/%CE%B4/User%7E%CE%91%CE%BD%CE%B4%CF%81%CE%AD%CE%B1%CF%82_58b5.html" title="User:Ανδρέας">Andreas</a> 20:26, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes. He's wrong and you're right. My note on VG was an attempt to word this more politely&#160;:) I'm afraid I don't have insight into Greek works.

<dd>andreas, I agree with you, modern greek is the same language of ancient greek, in fact i have studied ancient greek on likeo and i can sya that the distance between hellenistic greek and modern greek is the same as first medieval italian(see tacito capuano) and modern italian, they are mutually intellegible using the same pronounciacion, latin and italian is a more complicate matter, because latin has never been a language spoke by normal peaople was only the language of litterature and intellectual speaking, so volgar latin and moder italian can be defined as same language, they had same rules same word except of declension, but italian has got too some declnsion. Wikipedia is, as you said vulnerable to ideoligis, ottuse ideologist who try to impose thir point of view, beta eta upslion and other were pronuced i can say, at least since 300bc as b, è, y, they became fricatives later, latin transcription are lampant examples of the correct pronounce, ex&#160;: βασιλισκος, basiliscus. ευβεα, eubeae, and so on.

<p>Well it is ημων becaus it is Pater nostrum if it were υμων it would pater vestrum that means father of you, not of us, besides this, I have contacted my anciernt greek teacher she said that eta beta upsilon and othear had to be pronounced this way in orer to understand and decifre the the speech, imagien that umon and emon are pronounced in the sameway, how can a person understand if it is us or you?

<p>Please see my note to MATIA+. I would like to think that better documentation and more sources would discourage Thrax from his insistence on his position, but if you look over the Talk, he does not address most objections cogently. He also has some bizarre bee in his bonnet about the English, as though their view on ancient pronunciation was any different from the Germans, etc. Part of this is probably confusing between the practical teaching pronunciation and the reconstructed pronunciation, but not all. And he claims that Hatzidakis, Babiniotis, and Petrounias aren't "mainstream". If the prof. of linguistics at the Univ. of Athens isn't mainstream, who is? --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 22:52, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hello! I have some notes from the web at my talk page, along with Macrakis notes. I'm about to take a wikibreak but I hope I'll get involved with that wiki afterwards.

<p>It is not quite right to call the current linguistic reconstruction "Erasmian", for two reasons. First, some things are now reconstructed a bit differently from Erasmus. Secondly, "Erasmian" is usually used as the name of the practical teaching pronunciation (with phi as f etc.). And indeed Erasmus's original work on this talked about not only what was historically likely, but what is practical. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 17:42, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry Andreas I'm not a linguist, I have knowledge of acient greek from high school and some from college but it isn't my job, I'm pretty good at translating it but i'm no linguist, the only thing that I can do is finding my prof and get an explanation from him or searching something written around the web, as far i can rember, in college we red ancient greek with erasmian pronounce while the byzantine with modern ones.

<p>... i don't translate per entire the names so i put ... Here the translation, in this text, briefly appears the truth about the erasmian pronounciation. First in italian: Certamente Erasmo era stato spinto in questa occasione a scrivere De recte pronunciatione, ritengo che sapesse poco. Sembra che Erasmo abbia posto lo sguardo su questa scheda che ho, scritta a mano da Enrico.... uomo di lettere illustre. In questa scheda vi è scritto " ho sentito M. Ruggero professore di lingua greca nel collegio buslidano, mio precettore , che raccontava che, un tempo, egli avesse abitato con erasmo in un pedagogio a liensi Erasmo viveva nel piano inferiore del collegio,che fosse arrivato Glarum .... e che questi fu invitato nel collegio da Erasmo per pranzo, interrogato da erasmo rispose che (sapendo che Erasmo stesso era credulone e gli piacevano le cose nuove,una storiella ) tutti i madrelingua gerci che arrivavano a lutezia romproveravano gli umoni colti di sbagliare la pronuncia del greco antico. I greci infatti pronunciavano B vita , come beta(meaning that v was pronunced like b ) H ita,come eta (so H was like e) ai per ai(e), oi(i) per oi. Sentito ciò, poco dopo erasmo compone un libretto circa la corretta pronuncia del greco per far credere che lui fosse l'inventore dellla scoperta, e lo portò a Pietro alostes per stamparlo, il quale però, impegnato da latre cose, rifiutò, oppure stampo ò solo ciò che voleva del libretto, nessuno potrebbe dirlo. Erasmo mandò il libro da Basilea a Frobenio, dal quale fu stampato. Appresa la frode, erasmo sconsiglio agli amici sia parenti e a chi conosceva di usare la sua nuova pronuncia.M. Ruggero rese noto il manoscritto dello stesso Erasmo grazie allle formule di pronuncia di Damiano hispanese( che mi sembrano corrette) le quali non differiscono per nulla da quelle di Erasmo, che utilizzano sia i dotti che gli ignoranti di lingua greca. Scritto da Enrico corcopatero 1540 D.C</p>
<p>I will post english translation later cause gotta go work. F.S.S.D Philx <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilx_8434.html" title="User:Philx">Philx</a> 13:33, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Here it follows english translation, the translation is senso de senso no verba de verbo, that means that is more artistic and not too attached to the text, that is as being written in latin , heavy to read and plenty of subordinate clauses, if you want the more text attinent translation it is written in italian use this as guidelin to correct my english mistakes. Surely erasmus was forced in this occasion to write de recte pronutiatione, but i sustain that he knew little about that, it seem like he looke on this text that i've got,written by enric.. in this text is wriiten&#160;:i've heard M ruggerus, illustrius litterate and man of culture professor of ancient greek in buslidian university, mine precptor and that told that, he once, lived wih erasmus in a university, and that arrived Glarus, who was invited by erasmus at luch in the universty, interrogated by erasmus he said that (knowing that erasmus himself was gullible, and affiscinated by news , a joke ) all mothertongue greek that arrived in lutezia contested all the maior litterate on how they pronounce greek, sustaining that B was prounced a vita (being written βητα, so v was like b) H ita like eta ai (being e) as Ai and oi,i, as oι. Heard this, erasmus subsequentially wrote a small essay on the correct pronouciation of greek,to make himself the inventor of that. and gave this essay to Pietrus ... to print it, who but was too overstressed by the work and refused to print it or printed a small part of it, anybody would ever know, the book then was sent to frobenius who revealed the truth about the joke, understood the truth, erasmus suggested not to apply his rules of pronunciation written on the essay to everybody he knew, bu M ruggerus, publicated in good faith the rules of erasmus thanks to Damianum hispanes (wich ruels of pronounce with me) wich rules of pronouciation are similiar to erasmian ones, and these are utilized both by illiterate and illiterate on greek language. So in conclusion erasmus publicated , accidentally the correct pronouciation rules of ancient. Written by Henric cocropaeterus (or somethin ) circa 1540 bc. In conclusion erasmus found the correct pratical pronouciation rules thanks a joke.

I'm sure (excuse my presumption) that my translation it is correct, so erasmus truly invented the correct pronounciation of ancient greek, so untill 300bc b was b, h was e and so on, if i made mistakes could you please tell me where and of course i will post my translation in support to make reason thrax .

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Another translation</span></h2>
<p>Dear Ανδρέας,</p>
<p>Here is my translation. I have tried to keep it as close to the original as possible without making it unreadable in English. There appear to be a couple of small errors in the Latin:</p>
<ol>
<li>The second sentence begins: "Itaque visum hâc de adjicere," but there is no noun for "hâc" to modify. I think that the missing word is "re," and that it should come after "de."</li>
<li>The date probably should read: "CIƆ IƆ LXIX," or in modern Roman numerals, MDLXIX."</li>
</ol>
<p>And I believe that the reason why Erasmus was prompted to write about correct pronunciation is known to few people. So I have thought it proper to add on this subject what I have in a paper, written long ago by the hand of Henricus Coracopetraeus, an eminently learned man and a close friend to learned men. It reads thus: "I heard M. Rutgerus Reschius, professor of the Greek language in the Collegium Buslidianum at Leuven, my teacher of blessed memory, tell that he lived in the Liliense School along with Erasmus for two years, more or less. Erasmus occupied the upper bedroom; he, the lower one. Now Henricus Glareanus came from Paris to Leuven and was invited to the college for dinner by Erasmus. When he came and was asked what news he brought, he said (he had made this up on the way, because he knew that Erasmus was excessively fond of new things and amazingly credulous) that certain native Greeks had come to Paris, wonderfully learned men, who used a pronunciation of Greek different by far from what was accepted in these parts. 'Why, they say "beta" instead of "vita" (β), "eta" instead of "ita" (η), "ai" instead of "ae" (αι), "oi" instead of "i" (οι), and so forth.' Shortly after hearing that, Erasmus wrote the <i>Dialogue on the Correct Pronunciation of Latin and Greek</i>, so that he himself would appear to be the discoverer of this fact, and presented it to the printer Peter of Aalst to be printed. When Peter, perhaps busy with other things, refused, or at least said he could not print it as quickly as Erasmus wanted, Erasmus sent the pamphlet to Froben in Basel. It was soon printed by him and published. But Erasmus, when he had learned of the deception, never thereafter used that method of pronunciation, nor did he instruct the friends with whom he lived on intimate terms to adhere to it. As proof of this, M. Rutgerus displayed a rule of pronunciation, no different from that which learned and unlearned men everywhere use in that language, written by the hand of Erasmus himself as a favor to the Spaniard Damião de Góis, a copy of which is still in my possession." Henricus Coracopetraeus Cuccensis. At Nijmegen, 1569, Eve of St. Simon and St. Jude [i.e. October 27].</p>
<p>"Cuccensis" indicates where Coracopetraeus was from, but I have not managed to identify the place, nor his original surname, of which "Coracopetraeus" is a Latinized form.</p>
<p>If anything else remains unclear, please let me know. You are welcome to put my version on the talk page (which, by the way, should have as the section title "De recte Graece loquendo"). Thank you for asking me to translate this very interesting passage!</p>

<p>Matia, NPOV clearly states that marginal positions should be given little or no attention. Caragounis is marginal in every way.

<p>Yes, I can agree with you... This really is a cursed issue, but what I want is to state myself ethnically as what I want, just like every other person (or nation) in the world does. I don't mind if someone in Greece (a Greek) calls himself "Macedonian". I want we (Macedonians) to live in peace with all our neighbours (including Greece), and look in the future and leave the past behind us. I'm Macedonian and noone can deny what I like to be. <a href="../../../b/o/m/User%7EBomac_e7d7.html" title="User:Bomac">Bomac</a> 17:26, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You were fighting against windmills this time, Andreas! I don't represent any "Greek pseudo-nationalists who think that Greeks invented their alphabet from scratch" (sic) nor am I in any way connected to "ideologists who think that the pronunciation has always been the same". I don't even believe in creationism. In fact I first heard that the Greek alphabet was descended from the Phoenician one, in the second grade, and I haven't changed my mind since. Moreover, Herodotus (V, 58-61) states clearly the Phoenician origins; so does every respectable dictionary of the Greek language. Normally I am not writting grecocentric things about "true alphabets" but this time I was teased when I saw your quoting of the Foreign Ministry as a source on the issue. Now that I have seen your edit history I understand your need to preempt strikes from <i>fanatics</i> and not <i>nationalists</i> (because they don't do any service to the nation at all) by using "Babiniotis" and the "Ministry".

<p>Hello Andreas. Thanks for your answer:) E! You know many things for us then:) I like history too, but in Greece we are teaching almost only Greek History and I know little things about Quebec, Alsace etc.(wrong!) .If you read the history books of the Balkan countries, you will understand that every country through history is trying to make good ethnicists:) Somebody proposed to teach in Balkan schools one common history for all Balkan countries.:-)))))</p>
<p>I ll tell you another story. I studied in Sofia, so when I had to go and work in Florina's villages I understood, what old people, said in slavian.(of course I didn't said them that I understand <i>ntopia</i>:) When the people was gossiping in front of me they used only <i>ntopia</i>. Before 20 years was forbiden to speak ntopia in Florina but now its ok. I understand also that most of them don't even know why they speak so. Once an old woman, from the village I worked, went to buy some things from Bitola-FYROM (many people in Florina, go in FYROM to buy things because are much more cheeper than in Greece and its only 20km away). When she turned in the village in Greece she said to me: <i>Today I went to Bitola for first time and I realised that, there they speak <b>our</b> ntopia</i>!!!:))--<a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakedonas_6918.html" title="User:Makedonas">Makedonas</a> 18:33, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Greek is Μπότσαρης, so the sigma transsribes into s, see <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transliteration_of_Greek_into_English_67e1.html" title="Transliteration of Greek into English">Transliteration of Greek into English</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hello</span></h2>
<p>Hello Andrea! I'll try to explain you some of your questions:)</p>
<p>First of all as I know, Monastiri was the old name of Bitola because there was living many Greeks who after the balkan wars was moved especially in the town of Florina. (in bulgarian <i>obitel</i>=monastery) so I suppose that Bitola is the translation of the Greek word Monastiri. The streets to Bitola in Florina, Kozani, Thessaloniki are called <i>odos Monastiriou</i>(=Monastiriou street). The most of the people in Florina, and I, usually say <i>lets go to Bitola</i> because the word is smaller and easiest to say - than Monastiri, but in Kozani they say Monastiri. Sometimes in Florina they say <i>today i went inside Skopia</i>.</p>
<p>About <i>dopia</i>: I know that <i>Dopia</i> are different between the villages. In the north villages of Florina they looks like more the skopian dialect, but in the south villages in florina they don't looks like, so much. The children knows only words, but the oldest when they talk in the village they prefere to talk in <i>dopia</i>. I met some very old women above 90 years old (they usualy live many years) who didn't speak Greek:)!! I don't know if they watch skopian tv or radio but I know that they have signal in Florinas plain (their TV has very bad signal in the town of Florina although it is near border - if you have 15 greek channels with very good programm I dont think they like to watch 2 or 3 skopian channels with very poor programm). I know that there is a village which called Meliti and we say that there live many <i>philoskopians</i>. In the festival of this village in the summer when the official persons leave, the orchestre play slavic rythms.</p>
<p>Before I go to Florina I didn't know even that, they were people that speak this dialect. I didn't know nothing about this subject. In my first day at work when I heard <i>dopia</i> I though that these people weren't Greeks, but when they talk to me greek I asked them why they speak so&#160;:) I was very impressed because I could understant them! South of Ptolemaida (Kozani, Grevena, Kastoria) there aren't villages which speak dopia.</p>
<p>Well about me I went to study in Sofia first of all because I didn't pass in my exams in Greece:). I d like to study in Italy or England but it was too expensive and I prefered in Sofia because was very cheap, the medical university was realy good, and a lot of Greeks studied there. On 1995 when i went in Sofia there were 6,000 greek students in the city, but when I finished on 2002 were only 1,200 - now there are even less. That's because now the Greek children can much more easier pass in a greek university. I know some Bulgarians who study in Greece, not many.</p>
<p>As I know Greece has very good relations with Bulgaria and fyrom. Many companies, super markets, mobile operators, shops, factories, fast foods in these countries are owned by Greeks. From the other side they prefer to come for holidays in Chalkidiki, Thessaloniki, Kavala, Katerini and there are many economy emigrants here. In Kozani and Thessaloniki I see many cars from Skopia and Bulgaria and I see that the chambers of commerce of Kozani-Monastiri-Koritsa(Albania) very often last time exchange visits and work together.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bitola article</span></h2>
<p>Hello Andreas, sorry that I’m answering to your questions regarding the Bitola article a little bit late, but these days I’m pretty much busy and I’m officially on wikibreak. According to almost every source I found so far, Bitola as a settlement was established by the Macedonian Slavs that shifted in this area in the VI century: <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/65/bi/Bitola.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bartleby.com/65/bi/Bitola.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9080326?query=bitola&amp;ct=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9080326?query=bitola&amp;ct=" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Regarding the name, it is considered that the current official name have been gradually derived from the old Slavonic (not Bulgarian as some people think) word Obitel. So far, I found two different meanings for the word, the first one tells that it means a monastery, monastery place or monastery settlement and the second one tells that it means a family or house, an area of living. Very interesting fact that supports the second meaning is that the modern Serbian/Croatian word for family is Obitelj (I’m not sure for the other Slavic languages as Russian and Bulgarian):<a href="http://www.kat-pro.hr/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.kat-pro.hr/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>,<a href="http://www.sezam-hr.net/socijal.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sezam-hr.net/socijal.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. Maybe the truth lies (as always) in between, probably the word means a Christian/monastery community, family:<a href="http://www.soros.org.mk/konkurs/076/angver/herakleja.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.soros.org.mk/konkurs/076/angver/herakleja.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. However, you can notice that this word is not directly derived from the Greek word Monastery (Obitel and Monastery as words have completely different structures). It is not very clear how Bitola was called by Byzantines, according to some sources is was called Butela, Butelion, Botila, Botili, even Pelagonia, according to other sources it was called Monastiri, but I didn’t found any evidence so far for the second option. For that reason, I think the current design of the naming section satisfies both sides, because it provides the description of the Slavic word Obitel, as well as the fact that the Turkish, official name of the city before 1913 was Monastiri, derived from the Greek word for monastery. <a href="../../../b/i/t/User%7EBitola_dffb.html" title="User:Bitola">Bitola</a> 11:51, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Andreas. Thanks for your comments and your advice. I am currently in Romania and, unfortunately, I have too little time to answer (look at the time I am pasting this!).

<dd>Andreas, you are right. One should look around too. I just feel very αδικημένος. I wish I liked reading books as much as you do, but unfortunately my orientation is in what Greeks call "positive" sciences (math, physics etc). I understand that this conversation is pointless, but there is too much that comes along with the name. If it were only that, there would be no problem. I was amazed to read what happenned to the Prussians. I just want to make sure that it doesn't happen to anyone else... As per Slovenia-Veneto, that was a little bit far-fetched, but I wanted to make Aldux (Italian) understand what I mean. He didn't. I just can't understand the "nationalist" label, when someone is trying to bring a concensus with a middle solution.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>By the way, have you read the claims over "Aegean Macedonia", over the nationality of Alexander the Great, over the Ancient Macedonian Language? Over how much non-Greek the modern Greeks are? I think the following paragraph describes a little bit my theory about nationalism:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There is a new nationalistic approach around, that has the unique property of recruiting most anti-nationalist, liberal people, without them knowing it. It is a new kind of nationalism that instead of focusing on increasing the national awareness of its own people, it tries to decrease the one of all others. That way, it can impose it's multiethnic philosophy to any other nation by even recruiting local unaware liberals. This, is the most dangerous form of nationalism ever invented! I believe that people need to live peacefully, while respecting each-other's cultural, linguistic and historical differences. I also believe that globalisation is a good thing that will help most people come closer to one another. It will also help people mix and make nationalism an unnecessary cause. It is good, however, that different cultures, languages and histories exist, because a single one would make this planet a very borring place, and because diversity can help progress in different fields that better match the different local ways of life. I try to be neither the traditional old-fashioned nationalist, nor the dangerous new kind.

<p>A, Having noted a recent comment at diabetes, and having looked at your user page, it seems to me you ight be ideal to resolve an issue or two with the diabetic ketoacidosis article.</p>
<p>It was at one point my understanding that glucose production from disassembled body protein had the effect of competitively inhibiting a step in the lipid oxidation chain, resulting in piling up (as it were) of normally promptly consumed ketone bodies (the famous three musketeers only one of whom is actually a ketone). Prolonged sufficiently, we end up with enough of these to drive the body into acidosis, and thus DKA.</p>
<p>But, asssorted folks have told me differently (though they don't agree amongst themselves), and this article has persistently stated otherwise for some time, so I'm left unsure whether I should rewrite or not. As one who presumably knows, I invite you to help clarify the DKA article which is at the least dijointed if not factually inaccurate. <a href="../../../w/w/_/User%7EWw_6383.html" title="User:Ww">ww</a> 12:30, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A, Thanks for your prompt response. I had thought this one was worked out, dka being a large and central issue, but I may have been misinformed, wherever it was that I saw it.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Please do not discredit what you know nothing about</span></h2>
<p>Hello Andreas,</p>
<p>I was disappointed to originally see your re-write of the <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banitsa.html" title="Banitsa">Banitsa</a> article, but truly disgusted to see you completely wipe out all information I had contributed. I tried to stay neutral for the purpose of the whole Wiki project by providing names from both sides of the "argument".</p>
<p>I apologize for introducing the issue of other villages being renamed but I hardly see the deletion of the entire article because of it (it simply forces me to rewrite a similar article for each of the villages that were re-named).</p>
<p>As for the Macedonian definitions of the terms such as "lignite" and "lentils", I don't see the problem as similar translations were provided for Banitsa (Βεύη) just as other articles did the same (ie. Zeus Ζεύς).</p>
<p>If you are at all qualified to write similar articles for the villages from a "Greek perspective" (seeing as the villages are now Hellenized and part of Greece) by all means, you may do so and we shall cross-link the two related pages.</p>
<p>I plead you to take a non-nationalistic approach to such articles that involve the "Macedonian question" as it would undoubtedly tarnish the image of such a valuable project such as Wikipedia is. If I can accept your Greek ethnicity and identity, I think the least I can ask for is that you do the same for me and my family.</p>
<p><a name="Old_encyclopedia" id="Old_encyclopedia"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Old encyclopedia</span></h2>
<p>Ανδρέα, I think I mentioned before that the old Greek encyclopedia I had (my grandfather's) was still in packing boxes. But I have unpacked the boxes, and have only found old Greek <i>dictionaries</i>. The only old encyclopedia I got from him was a (very good) French encyclopedia, the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grande_Encyclopedie_fb46.html" title="Grande Encyclopedie">Grande Encyclopedie</a> (1886 to 1902). The 12th edition of the Britannica (1922) under 'Greece' starts "...The Balkan wars of 1912-3 added to the Kingdom New Greece, consisting of Macedonia, Epirus, Crete, ..." but doesn't explicitly say if they are 'provinces'. It lists 31 'departments' as of 1914 (including Salonika, Florina, etc.) -- the only one mentioning Macedonia is "Pella (Macedonia) (This prefecture was formerly included in that of Salonika)", plus an additional 11 departments in 4 post-war provinces (Thrace etc.).</p>
<p>Have you read any of the bibliography in <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonians_%28ethnic_group%29.html" title="Macedonians (ethnic group)">Macedonians (ethnic group)</a> (which I contributed)? I have read Danforth, but only excerpts or reviews or the others. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 17:35, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Oh crap! It should be <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28pronunciation%29_303e.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (pronunciation)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (pronunciation)</a>. I put a space instead of a colon. The idea is that, in link form, IPA characters can or diacritics can be obscured by the underline (such as with the greek mid-vowels). Besides, indicating (and linking) at the top of a page or table that IPA is being used allows the reader to click on the IPA page to understand the particular characters. Most of what I've been changing today has also removed redundancy since putting /i/ in a table that indicates closeness, backness, and rounding means you don't need to link the vowel any further.</p>

<p><i>Stavro, you have an old Greek encyclopedia, could you scan a old Map of Greece that has the word ΜΑΚΕΔΟΝΙΑ on it?</i><br />

<p>Did not find a map, but here's an interesting passage:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The appropriation of the legacy of ancient Macedonia by the modern Greeks belongs historically to the second half of the nineteenth century. Politis (1993:40-42) cites fourteen examples from the Greek literature of the 1794-1841 period in which the ancient Macedonians are not considered to be part of the ancient Greek world. Prominent intellectuals like Ioannis Rizos Neroulos and Adamantios Koraes were among those who shared this viewpoint.

<dd>Hi Andrea, sorry if I sound agitated in the deletion vote. It's not personal, nor do I suppose that you don't agree (at least in part). I just wanted to make a point for the rest of the readers/voters. I'm also thinking of modifying my vote according to Telex's (and apparently Aldux's and Lukas') more rational proposal. Btw, you've got mail!</dd>

<dd>Thanks for this link. Unfortuanately I cannot read Greek in the least, so I would not feel comfrotable uploading anything. I am still reasearching the best files to use for different versions. So if I find a nice version of the Septuagint for easy upload I will let you know. Right not I am copying and pasting from a fancy html version but it will not work once we try to automate this project. I would encourage all the greek editors to try and keep the ancient texts at el. They can be easily seperated by categories and then you will not have to duplicate all the tedious administrative work. Plus it will be easier for readers to find what they want if it is all in one place. If greek is anything like english you have many modern translations into greek of old greek texts and it nice to be able to offer all variations together. This is all from my experience at the english wikisource where the issues are very different from the wikipedias, however if the greek wikisource community really sees a need for a split you should certainly be given one.--<a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirgitteSB_e0e3.html" title="User:BirgitteSB"><font color="#F4A460">Birgitte§β</font></a> ʈ <a href="../../../b/i/r/User_talk%7EBirgitteSB_b59e.html" title="User talk:BirgitteSB"><small><font color="#778899">Talk</font></small></a> 16:51, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Your User name</span></h2>
<p>Please note the impact of your user name on the reader almost entirely ignorant of Greek letters and language: nothing short of extraordinary! My own limited exposure to the Greek alphabet consists of whatever appears in the mainstream press, i.e. individual letters. I've made some desultory efforts to gain familiarity with the Cyrillic alphabet, enough to decode and identify names (both in my work as an archives translator and as an Israeli consumer reading shop signs and labels on supermarket shelves), but "my" Greek has remained stagnant – until now. The opportunity of seeing your signature in Greek, then Latin letters, prompted me, almost automatically, to compare the two, and to realize (to my considerable relief and satisfaction) that the Greek alphabet is more accessible than I'd imagined. Consequently, I'll be more bold in the future, and anticipate further progress. So this is to express my appreciation for this unexpected boon -- Thanks! <i>-- <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDeborahjay_6670.html" title="User:Deborahjay">Deborahjay</a> 06:00, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</i></p>

<dd>Unfortunately, there is no universal standard, and you will find all sorts of <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transliteration.html" title="Transliteration">transliterations</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transcription_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Transcription (linguistics)">transcriptions</a>. For an overview, see <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transliteration_of_Greek_to_the_Latin_alphabet_75d0.html" title="Transliteration of Greek to the Latin alphabet">Transliteration of Greek to the Latin alphabet</a>. Wikipedia articles are the most unreliable source for this, because all transliterations/transcriptions are very inconsistent. Greek sources are also inconsistent: the name as spelled on a roadside sign may differ from the on on the official web page, etc. For your purpose, the best solution is to find the original spelling in Greek characters (very reliable and consistent), and use one of the officially recognized systems (I would prefer the UN/ELOT one). Better still, stick to the Greek version (in Unicode), because none of the transliteration schemes is fully reversible ("η"and "ι" are both transliterated as "i"). Don't use <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greeklish.html" title="Greeklish">Greeklish</a>, it is highly unscientific. Another caveat: Some place names have changed endings from Ancient Greek to Modern Greek to comply with modern Greek grammar (Serrai -&gt; Serres). A few like Athinai -&gt; Athina changed from plural to singular. Some places have variant names like Κεφαλληνία - Κεφαλονιά. <a href="../../../%CE%B1/%CE%BD/%CE%B4/User%7E%CE%91%CE%BD%CE%B4%CF%81%CE%AD%CE%B1%CF%82_58b5.html" title="User:Ανδρέας"><span style="color:white;background:#227">&#160;<span style="background:#338">&#160;<span style="background:#449">A<span style="background:#55a">n<span style="background:#66b">d<span style="background:#77c">r</span>e</span>a</span>s</span>&#160;</span>&#160;</span></a> <sup><a href="../../../%CE%B1/%CE%BD/%CE%B4/User_talk%7E%CE%91%CE%BD%CE%B4%CF%81%CE%AD%CE%B1%CF%82_bdc1.html" title="User talk:Ανδρέας"><font size="-2">(T)</font></a></sup> 13:58, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>According to <a href="../../../u/_/_/WP%7EU_ebb9.html" title="WP:U">WP:U</a>, your Greek-character username is not appropriate for the English Wikipedia. I would strongly (and respectfully) recommend <a href="../../../c/h/u/WP%7ECHU_759d.html" title="WP:CHU">changing it</a>. Has no one discussed this with you yet? I am surprised.

<dd>Probably best to ask an admin if you're serious about it, but the <a href="../../../c/h/u/WP%7ECHU_759d.html" title="WP:CHU">WP:CHU</a> page <i>might</i> explain how that could take place. Since you've no ill intent, I can understand why no admin has insisted. It doesn't matter to me, either, but I know that many people would only get boxes instead of Greek characters, so that's a minor thought... - <a href="../../../c/o/b/User%7ECobaltbluetony_df3f.html" title="User:Cobaltbluetony">CobaltBlueTony</a> 20:12, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
