<p>I had a good break from all this in the real world and regained some perspective. I'm still very angry with how they treated Al and can't cope with any of the wider community stuff with its posturing and petty power play, but the science articles lured me back.

<p>Hello Andew c:</p>
<p>I read your following comment about Mexico being listed in Central America:</p>
<p><i>Why is Mexico listed under Northern America when the Northern America article says specifically that Mexico is not included. Also, the Central America article notes that Mexico is usually not included as well, so where does that leave Mexico if it isn't Central or Northern? I think the best solution would be to not use "Northern America" at all, and use the confusing, redundent, yet common phrase "North America*"... *not refering to the continent.--Andrew c 21:37, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</i></p>

<p>You might want to hold off on the subcategorization you've been doing with the directory. Not that I have anything against it, quite the contrary. The pages were never really done; we were just working to ensure that all the projects got included. I am in the process of making newer versions of the directory pages in userspace, including several projects under several headings when appropriate. For instance, I think "Star Trek" will fall under Television, Novels, Comics, Film, and Video Games. I think. Don't quote me on that; I don't have the list in front of me right now. But you might want to hold off on the reorganization until the final organization is in place. If you want to add to them, however, they are under those which have been started are at User:Badbilltucker/History and society Directory and User:Badbilltucker/Culture Directory. The rest will follow. I think the final model will be following the subcategorization you wanted, maybe a bit too much so. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 20:06, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>When I said all the names were included in the new directory on the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Council_9ee4.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Council">Wikipedia:WikiProject Council</a> talk page, that's exactly what I meant. I just did that so that we could know what all is out there and that everyone could start to see which, if any, were just old boilerplate which never amounted to anything and could reasonably be deleted. In the process, I and the others found that there were a <b>lot</b> of projects (over 1000 total) and that many fall into more than one niche. Now that I have had all the names included on the basic directory, I am in the process of trying to break them down into categories. I have the lists of categories prepared, and am now individually going through them and seeing which projects were just abortive attempts which could be deleted safely, and adding the rest. Regarding the redirect you mentioned, I honestly don't know anything about that and had nothing to do with it. My guess is that whoever did do that thought that the new unfinished directory, which includes several hundred projects more than the old one, was, even with its flaws, more useful to have. And don't apologize about "butting in". I wouldn't have known the old list was deleted otherwise, and am grateful for the information. Knowing that, I have more incentive to complete the new one more quickly. I'm hoping that it should be done early next week. Thanks for the info, though, and my apologies for the premature action of whoever eliminated the old list. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 14:42, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree with that we butted heads in the past, however, I believe we both do not want a repitition of us butting of heads based on your last message to me and my desire for reconciliation. Secondly, I agree the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_literalism.html" title="Biblical literalism">Biblical literalism</a> article was a mess. I changed the order of the arguments since the arguments for biblical literalism should proceed the arguments against it in a <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_literalism.html" title="Biblical literalism">Biblical literalism</a> article. Secondly, I removed the uncited material that offered no <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_exegesis.html" title="Biblical exegesis">Biblical exegesis</a>. Lastly, you should know that I mostly did the editing to the article as a favor to you since we butted heads in the past. I am far more interested in issues having to do with Christianity/Bible and history/science. <a href="../../../k/d/b/User%7EKdbuffalo_898d.html" title="User:Kdbuffalo">ken</a> 17:58, 23 September 2006 (UTC)kdbuffalo</p>

<p>We seem to have a trouble with the source in the first paragraph. I think there is a misunderstanding. You have used different words in different edits. I am confused as to what wording to use, and am not trying to change the quote. Here is the example.</p>
<p>Revision as of 03:33, 26 September 2006 Andrew c <i>The latter 3, called the "Pastoral Epsitles," are generally considered by critical scholars to be pseudonymous.</i></p>
<p>Current revision (15:37, 26 September 2006) Andrew c <i>The latter 3, called the "Pastoral Epsitles," are more disupted, with wide agreement among scholars regarding them as pseudonymous.</i></p>
<p>Those are both your edits. My edit, which is sandwiched in between, read: Revision as of 08:30, 26 September 2006; Lostcaesar <i>The latter 3, called the "Pastoral Epsitles," are more disupted, with many critical scholars regarding them as pseudonymous</i></p>
<p>It seems that the major change to the reference was a product of your edits. Thus your edits have said both "generally considered by critical scholars", and "wide agreement among scholars".</p>
<p>Just trying to clear up some confusion. <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostcaesar_f99b.html" title="User:Lostcaesar">Lostcaesar</a> 15:08, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Re:Andrew, I see now. I think we can drop critical, and my phrasing as well. I think the best thing to do would be to preserve Ehrman's rather bold assertion; I will try to cite the counter-claim properly when I get a moment. Actually, I wonder if this kind of back-and-forth style is right for the intro. I don't know - what do you think? Let me say I am glad that you are giving attention to the article. A while ago, someone observed the citations needed and the use of weasel words, so I tried to improve this, though I ran out of steam before the pastoral section. However, my contributions alone would be imbalanced, no matter how well I try and frame them. <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostcaesar_f99b.html" title="User:Lostcaesar">Lostcaesar</a> 19:53, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Whelp... I've removed allot of the POV from Biblical Literalism, admittedly only to replace it with much of my own.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I've been to semniary, search google over and over read through all my Bibliology texts and inerrency thesese&lt;-? and cannot find a single proponentary&lt;-? definition for biblical literalism. I've found lots of Liberal Christian sites and anti Christian sites lambasting the literalists and offering definitions, opinions and solutions. And with those sources we have our new literalism page. It's crap. But at least its cited crap.

<p>Hi, Andrew</p>
<p>(I'm posting this on your page instead of the Talk page because it gets into some specifics and I don't want to mess with all the "You're a bigot" allegations that start the moment someone mentions any specific religion.)</p>
<p>We tried in the Messianic prophecies article to only discuss major views. The problem was that a guy in a Bahai cult (BUPC) that only has about 1,000 members worldwide kept adding loads of stuff from his cult's views and misrepresenting it as mainstream. Even Bahai's were complaining about it. Attempts to correct it wound up in constant edit wars.</p>
<p>Regarding, "We'll discuss it if necessary", my response is "been there, done that -- repeatedly." Look through the edit history of the Messianic prophecies article and you'll see the problem. Just changing "prophecies" to "prophecy" won't avoid the problem. The only way <i>that works</i> to deal with details of divergent traditions is the sub-article approach. (Also look through articles like <a href="../../../m/e/s/Messiah.html" title="Messiah">Messiah</a>.)</p>
<p>The reason I posted at the top is because it was a <b>really</b> major revert because of how distorted, gutted and off-topic the article had become and because editors obviously were not aware of the history and problems the article was created to resolve.</p>
<p>At the time I wrote the original article there were Jewish, Bahai and BUPC editors sitting there waiting to pounce on anything they considered POV, so it was deliberately written to present opposing views, examples of alleged prophecies, etc.--<i>after a compromise agreeing to do a general "concept" article and sub-articles</i>. From what I can tell, it looks like none of the recent editors were involved in the "prophecies" article. For instance, "Jesus fulfilled XYZ" claims were deliberately omitted (possible POV) and the article was deliberately made an "only explain the concept" article to avoid constant item-by-item attempted refutations by several Jewish WP administrators. In any multi-religion prophecy article, they insert 2-3 "opposing view" sentences for <i>each</i> "fulfillment" sentence. They don't insert them in a separate section, they insert them directly following the "fulfillment" sentence. The article winds up being unreadable garbage.</p>
<p>I really <i>do</i> hope various editors will create additional specialized articles. I originally created a disambiguation page for numerous "Messianic prophecy (&lt;religion&gt; view)" but it was deleted (without my objection) because no one created the relevant pages within a reasonable time.</p>
<p>By the way, I suggest you check out my user page about my religious background. I have a much broader background than most WP contributors, whose background and training generally are in a single religion. I'm the one who put in the extensive reference section to begin with.</p>
<p>(I consider myself a Messianic gentile but I regularly attend a Methodist church, a Messianic synagogue and a Reform Jewish synagogue.)</p>

<p>yeah.. regarding the same article. If the Bahai faith claims no Messiah as was mentioned on the page, there's no need to include that info. It's not a POV thing, everything in the universe doesn't need to be mentioned. The matrix trilogy for instance , doesn't need to be mentioned. You can have an article on a subject and only the relevant info needs to be in there. You don't need every single religions POV in there to make in NPOV.

<p>Andrew, you may not know I answered your concerns from the 'Revelelation' discussion page. Allow me to reproduce it here for your behalf: "No, it does not sound harsh. I cite all my sources, which are all primary, that is from authors from the antiquity. Sorry, I do not used tertiary sources (such as the opinions and interpretations of contemporary writers) and I will not apologize for that. Who am I? If you look at the parent site posted on top of the page, "Front page: Daniel &amp; Revelation" <a href="http://www.geocities.com/b_d_muller/danrv.html" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/b_d_muller/danrv.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/b_d_muller/danrv.html</a> , you will notice I provide my full name and a link to a short bio "about the author". Self-published? I can have somebody posting the link for me: as you can see from the parent site, I have some happy readers. The parent website I just mentioned shows ranked in 4th position on Google and 8th on Yahoo! for "Daniel and Revelation". Maybe I should propose the parent webpage, which is very short and proceed very quickly towards either Daniel or Revelation. Either that, or stating my name and posting the link to my bio on the 'Revelation' page. What do you think? (NEWS: ALL MY PAGES HAVE A LINK TO MY BIO AND EMAIL). BTW, thanks Andrew for saying you like my page. I want to tell you the links I proposed are well-researched, very thorough, contains no hate and would be an asset to Wikipedia. Try that short one: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/b_d_muller/index.html" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/b_d_muller/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/b_d_muller/index.html</a> Note: that site has been posted as a link, for a long time (please don't remove it!) on Wikipedia pages about 'historical Jesus', 'historicity of Jesus' and 'Jesus myth'. Under 'historical Jesus', the site is in 13th position on Google and 6th on Yahoo! Maybe I am not a registered scholar, but I thought Wikipedia was not all about propagating the work of professionals. I consider myself more of a critical &amp; investigative amateur historian, with burning (but not blinding) passion about the history of very early Christianity. And my approach (and background) should be commended in a field almost fully "owned" by scholars (most of them on a payroll) with very different opinions &amp; theories (which would prove that scholarly works, in this specific field, may be the problem, not the solution). I must admit I am very annoyed when my pages are rejected, mainly because some existing links are of bad quality, very biased or totally irrelevant (Check the last link on the 'Ignatius of Antioch' page --'Ignatius of Nerdtreehouse')(NEWS: I DELETED THE LINK). (BTW, I would love to attract your attention on these bad links, after reviewing them, of course). I did participate about one year ago into editing the 'Jesus' page. But that was very discouraging, with my work being often chopped down by evangelical Christians, even after some very long discussions. Please also note my webpages are ad-free. ..." I checked the page on Ignatius of Antioch, and I am outraged on how one-sided it is. More like an oulet for the Catholic Church (if true as stated, we should be all practicing Catholics). Is it what Wikipedia is all about? Why can no opposing views be exposed (which they are, in a lot of details and justifications, on my page on Ignatius)?

<p>Since you may not be aware I answered you latest comments on the Revelation discussion page, I'll reproduce my reply here: "Thanks for your comments, Andrew. I feel sorry that Wikipedia would sponsor the old guard of well-financed scholars. I am not even trying to change anything on the main text of these "religious" pages [outrightly so Christian you wonder who owned Wikipedia], certainly not attempting to publish my thoughts in front, just to propose, through a link, some well-evidenced thesis offering in the process some refreshingly clear-cut solutions. And I got feedback as such: "Your web page is very informative! The reading of Revelation without the Christian additions is suddenly very clear. My dad and I are very excited by your research" "Daniel and Revelation: Really enjoyed reading your material. ... Thank you again, for the clear scholarly presentation. So many times I truthfully have no idea what the authors are attempting to say. My humbly opinion being "they" use words that they themselves understand to be quoted as if.... From the tower or perhaps from God or at least a demigod.... The goal of educating not only clergy but all who may seek wisdom. ... You are accomplishing on your Internet pages." "I think ALSO that you have the makings of a scholarly site" "Your intellectual honesty is striking. A quality that is rare nowadays. Most of the time writers have a conclusion in mind and argue their way to lead the reader to see things the way they do." "Just wanted to thank you for your work. I've been trying to make sense of Revelation for years and never did know where to start. You have single handedly cleared it up for me. Fascinating research." Amateurs are the ones who do not try to make a living through their research, and therefore, for the honest ones, not biased and very open to all of the primary evidence, wherever it leads. Please note that my two main entry pages <a href="http://www.geocities.com/b_d_muller/index.html" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/b_d_muller/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/b_d_muller/index.html</a> and <a href="http://www.geocities.com/b_d_muller/danrv.html" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/b_d_muller/danrv.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/b_d_muller/danrv.html</a> were very popular on Google and Yahoo! before one of them (the first one) was posted as a link on three Wikipedia pages. So there is no circular reasoning here. Now, almost 80% of the "clicks" for my page on 'Revelation' (my most popular page these days) come from Yahoo! If you search there for just 'Revelation', my page shows in 6th position (and I am not even posted on Wikipedia!). So I think the whole thing is very unfair.

<p>I made the following addition in front of my page, just to show the ideas I exposed in it are not without scholarly backing: From JewishEncyclopedia.com - REVELATION (BOOK OF), Article by Crawford Howell Toy (Christian scholar, D.D., LL.D.) and Kaufmann Kohler (Ph.D.): "The last book in the New Testament canon, yet in fact one of the oldest; probably the only Judæo-Christian work which has survived the Paulinian transformation of the Church. The introductory verse betrays the complicated character of the whole work. It presents the book as a "Revelation which God gave . . . to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass," and at the same time as a revelation of Jesus Christ to "his servant John." According to recent investigations, the latter part was interpolated by the compiler, who worked the two sections of the book—the main apocalypse (ch. iv.-xxi. 6) and the letters to the "seven churches" (i.-iii. and close of xxii.)—into one so as to make the whole appear as emanating from John, the seer of the isle of Patmos in Asia Minor (see i. 9, xxii. 8), known otherwise as John the Presbyter. The anti-Paulinian character of the letters to the seven churches and the anti-Roman character of the apocalyptic section have been a source of great embarrassment, especially to Protestant theologians, ever since the days of Luther; but the apocalypse has become especially important to Jewish students since it has been discovered by Vischer (see bibliography) that the main apocalypse actually belongs to Jewish apocalyptic literature." In general agreement with the above, next, I will provide a short synopsis, with some remarks (mostly about authorship), before proceeding to the ancient text, where, with inserted comments, points previously postulated will make a lot of sense (I hope you'll agree, as some of my previous readers: see here)."

<p>Hello, I had some contributions or possibly changes that I wished to make to the section on Gnostics, and I wanted to run them by you since you both contributed heavily to that section and are presumably "in the know" about the subject.</p>
<p>First, The passages says that "while some Gnostics were docetics, most Gnostics believed that Jesus was a human who became possessed by the spirit of Christ during his baptism." However, I have a text in front of me by Henry Chadwick, a well known historian of antique Christianity, who writes "Most of the [gnostic] groups were for the divine, not for the human redeemer, and in most cases disbelieved in the reality of Christ's human flesh." He then argues that 1 John contains a polemic against this Gnostic view. He concludes "to gnostics, death on the cross seemed incompatible with divine presence." This seems to be a factual issue of some merit, and I would like your opinion on whether, and how, to include the differing analysis (if I am indeed understanding the views properly). I will says that in my amateur reading of some gnostic works I do distinctly recall an absence of the cross.</p>
<p>Second, the passage mentions that Gnostics held certain beliefs about the demiurge (which is no doubt true). Because this conjures up ideas of Platonism, I would like to mention that the Neo-Platonists, such as Porphyry and Simplicius, basically saw gnosticism as a mortal enemy.</p>
<p>Third, the paragraph says that Gnostics tended to "interpret the New Testament" as allegory, but I have problems with this use of New Testament, since it strikes me as anachronistic in that the New Testament canon had not been settled, and indeed the books were being written while gnosticism was well underway, and also because the Gnostics held many writings as spiritually profitable that would never be in the New Testament. So I think the accuracy of this passage could be improved.</p>
<p>Fourth, and lastly, I think it worth differentiating between contemporary gnosticism and ancient gnosticism. The last sentence, which reads "the movement" is not clear that the modern movement is historically fissured from that of antiquity and in many ways distinct. There is a difference between early views and contemporary reconstructions of early views. Of course I must admit my total ignorance to the neo-gnostic movements of today, and would certainly need input on how to properly describe the similarities and differences.</p>
<p>I am interested on your thoughts and advice. I will say, I am in no rush, nor am I dead set on such changes happening, but I think they are a good idea. <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostcaesar_f99b.html" title="User:Lostcaesar">Lostcaesar</a> 13:36, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>1, Chadwick does not say that all gnostics were docetic, only that most were. I think the difference is just on whether most were or not, since both sources agree that some were and some were not. I don’t recall saying anything about the resurrection. The quotes you mention sound docetic to me, but I'm no expert — they get uncomfortable with the idea of physical death on the cross. 2, You are righ, point dropped (this just comes from my own interest in neo-platonic philosophy really). 3, I'll think up a sentence and offer it when one which sounds right comes to mind — your suggestion is good. 4, I am only thinking a few words here, perhaps around the "rediscovery" passage which might be the right moment to mention something. <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostcaesar_f99b.html" title="User:Lostcaesar">Lostcaesar</a> 17:08, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for fixing the image before I had gotten to it in de-indirecting!</p>
<p>I suspect you are more interested in <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_P._Meier_6914.html" title="John P. Meier">John P. Meier</a> than in <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Meier_%28Australia%29_3078.html" title="John Meier (Australia)">John Meier (Australia)</a>...

<p>Well... I only knew of the German folklorist; so this night I've learned a bit more of biblical history and Australian politics than I expected&#160;:-) I've no protest; but did you remove the disambiguation header from all three articles? <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoergenB_358a.html" title="User:JoergenB">JoergenB</a> 01:00, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was wondering if you could answer this question. How would I go about moving Image:Archilochus-alexandri-002-edit1.jpg over to the commons? I know if I upload the image with the exact same name, the redirect won't work. However, could I mark the image here for speedy deletion, and then the redirect work? Or is this too much of a hassle and I should let it be and just in the future upload images (and edits) to the commons?

<li>You can upload the same picture on Commons with an every so slightly different name. Then, just tell me ( or do it your self and tell me afterwards) and we can replace all instances of it with the commons version. Then, we tag the non-commons one with {{<a href="../../../n/o/w/Template%7ENowCommons_a542.html" title="Template:NowCommons">NowCommons</a>}}. <b><i><a href="../../../n/a/u/User%7ENauticashades_7c1a.html" title="User:Nauticashades">Nautica</a></i><a href="../../../n/a/u/User_talk%7ENauticashades_63f5.html" title="User talk:Nauticashades"><font color="black">Shad</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="black">e</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7ENauticashades_473d.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Nauticashades"><font color="black">s</font></a></b> 07:15, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I appreciate all your help.

<dd>I'm glad I could help. On the subject of changing the name, you are right in a way, but as the old saying goes: <i>If you want it done right, then do it yourself</i>. In othr words, the {{<a href="../../../n/o/w/Template%7ENowCommonsThis_046c.html" title="Template:NowCommonsThis">NowCommonsThis</a>}} area has severe backlog, and it would take weeks (if not months) to sort this whole issue out. If we upload it under a different name, we can change all instances of the non-commons one to the commons one and get it over with, as opposed to the admins having to do it. <b><i><a href="../../../n/a/u/User%7ENauticashades_7c1a.html" title="User:Nauticashades">Nautica</a></i><a href="../../../n/a/u/User_talk%7ENauticashades_63f5.html" title="User talk:Nauticashades"><font color="black">Shad</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="black">e</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7ENauticashades_473d.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Nauticashades"><font color="black">s</font></a></b> 15:51, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think it might be a good idea for you to reread this, too, having weathered what I would characterize as tedious "letter, not spirit" arguments viz policy initiated by you before (is arithmetic OR, etc&#160;:-). I do mean it in a friendly way. Are tedious policy discussions-- cross-posted posthaste to several boards--necessary to decipher if current pubmed research should be excluded rom articles, or if one sentence summaries of them should be tendentiously debated at length viz wording? I think the problems here are much simpler, are being blown out of proportion, and can be discussed and resolved much more succinctly.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is not a Bureaucracy</p>
<p>Wikipedia is not a moot court, and although rules can make things easier, they are not the purpose of the community and instruction creep should generally be avoided. A perceived procedural error made in posting anything, such as an idea or nomination, is not grounds for invalidating that post. Follow the spirit, not the letter, of any rules, policies and guidelines. Disagreements should be resolved through consensual discussion, rather than through tightly sticking to rules and procedures.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> (<a href="../../../c/i/n/User_talk%7ECindery_8084.html" title="User talk:Cindery">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cindery_c3ff.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cindery">contribs</a>) 16:15, 3 November 2006.</small></p>

<p>Thanks for explanation.

<p>Being pro-choice is not apart of the Christian left. Being pro-life is still a concept of the Christian left. If someone is a left wing politican that is pro choice, and a Christian, that doesn't mean they are apart of the Christian left. Catholic for Choice is also not a religious organization. The members of the organization are mostly non-Christians. The Christian left believe that people should oppose abortion because it goes against social justice. The same reason that most people that oppose abortion feel. <a href="../../../7/5/2E/User%7E75.3.28.188.html" title="User:75.3.28.188">75.3.28.188</a> 07:12, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Being for abortion or for gay marriage may be identified by some people as left wing, but they are really not. Supporting abortion goes against human rights and social justice. It's not possible for a Christian to be for social justice and also for abortion. The article is confusing Christian idealogy like social justice with people who believe in Christianity but are not good Christians like people that support abortion. <a href="../../../7/5/2E/User%7E75.3.28.188.html" title="User:75.3.28.188">75.3.28.188</a> 07:20, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The Christian left is it supposed to be for Christians with leftist views based on Christianity or is it for Christians with leftist views based on reasons unrelated to their religion? The article never makes a clear distinction. For instance, Martin Luther King, Jr. and many of those priests, had what some people considered leftist views, but they did not base their views on leftist politics. They based their views on Christianity. They were neither left or right, they were simply Christians. They also would not belong in the article if people that support abortion and other social injustices can be placed in the article as well. <a href="../../../7/5/2E/User%7E75.3.28.188.html" title="User:75.3.28.188">75.3.28.188</a> 18:21, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
