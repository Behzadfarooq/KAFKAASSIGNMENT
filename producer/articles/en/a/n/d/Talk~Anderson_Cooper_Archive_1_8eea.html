<p>His father, Wyatt Cooper, was raised Southern Baptist. His mother, Gloria Vanderbilt, was raised Catholic. I've heard Anderson is Episcopalian - no confirmation though. He does, however, collect crucifixes.</p>
<p>I've seen him say "god bless you" or similar such things to people during the reporting of Katrina/Rita. I've never come across him discussing his religious beliefs in public, though. 65.186.79.160 01:23, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>There was a large crucifix on the wall of one of the rooms in Anderson's former loft in the InStyle photo shoot and another that was on a nightstand.</p>

<p>God, this shouldn't matter, but how can anyone not be convinced that Anderson Cooper is gay? Ask virtually any gay man living in New York City in the mid 1990's whether or not they've seen Anderson at a gay bar (Boiler Room, anyone?) or whether or not he's dated their friends (he's dated some of mine). I think the refusal to believe he's gay is mostly due to America's continual refusal to believe anyone more masculine that Paul Lynde is gay.</p>
<p>He's gay. Who cares. Move on.</p>

<dd>Why does everyone get so upset at the suggestion that someone might be gay? Is that defamation? I don't think so. It's an interesting aspect of his personal life, and sure to disappoint some ladies out there, but it's not bad. I don't know why people are getting so uppity about whether or not there is "conclusive proof," as if we're calling the man a murder just by discussing his sexual orientation. What kind of a puritanical society do we live in? And we wonder why the politicians in D.C. call the middle of the nation "fly over country."</dd>

<p>-As the above user comments on Mr. Cooper's sexuality, I am not absolutely sure that the line about the "persistent rumors" is necessary for his wiki article. Now I am actually myself positive that he is indeed gay. When Mr. Cooper was actually living in Atlanta he came into a gay club and ordered a drink down the bar from me. He appeared to be waiting for someone. Wouldn’t stand up in court but that was enough given all else that is known about Cooper to convince me. That said, until if and when Mr. Cooper makes a statement on his sexuality could it be best to leave the matter aside?--<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Burdett_6d58.html" title="User:Francis Burdett">Francis Burdett</a> 20:47, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well it can't be in the article unless you have real proof (i.e. he actually admitted it).

<p>From <a href="../../../g/a/y/Category%7EGay%2C_lesbian_or_bisexual_people_062c.html" title="Category:Gay, lesbian or bisexual people">Category:Gay, lesbian or bisexual people</a>, "This category is a partial listing of notable gay, lesbian and bisexual people who have publicly declared their sexual orientation, or whose sexual orientation is known and not debated by historians." I don't really think that Anderson Cooper fits this definition and I think that the categorization should be removed from this article. Whether or not he <i>is</i> gay, he has not publicly declared his sexual orientation, and it seems to be a matter of some debate. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimc_6767.html" title="User:Timc">timc</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../t/i/m/User_talk%7ETimc_362b.html" title="User talk:Timc">Talk</a> 17:43, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah, even though it is obvious to those who really care, he hasn't come out and declared his sexual orientation. I really think it should be removed from the article. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Graham_a3b5.html" title="User:William Graham">waffle iron</a> 23:59, 3 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is suppose to be an encyclopedia. It doesn't matter how many people in Anderson Cooper's neighbourhood "know" that he's gay. The fact that he's gay should only be added to the article if there is conclusive proof, verifiable by the reader. More importantly his sexual orientation should only be added if it is relevant to this article. There are thousands of biographical entries in Wikipedia where the subject's sexual orientaion is not mentioned. --65.94.43.50</p>
<p>While I do not know if he is gay or not, it is relevant to this entry because of the numerous discussions about his sexual orientation online (e.g. on <a href="http://www.blogactive.com/2005/09/new-york-magazine-outs-anderson-cooper.html" class="external text" title="http://www.blogactive.com/2005/09/new-york-magazine-outs-anderson-cooper.html" rel="nofollow">BlogActive</a>). To maintain a neutal POV, I have quoted from NY Magazine (see <a href="http://newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/features/14301/index3.html" class="external text" title="http://newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/features/14301/index3.html" rel="nofollow">the fourth page</a>) which gives quite a bit of background to the issue and quotes Cooper directly... he doesn't want to talk about his "personal life" ^_- But that non-answer in itself is something. I tried to tie it into the "Cooper has frequently been involved with gay and lesbian issues" section; sorry if the connection looks a bit clunky. -- <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimulus_9998.html" title="User:Limulus">Limulus</a> 11:34, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>No. We still don't have word from him. It's just speculation. At the most it deserves a short mention and possibly a link to the homosexual speculation page.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Are we to censor those who <i>legitimately believe</i> that Cooper is gay when the Wikipedia page I quoted from explicitly says that we should document their views? Plus I tried to balance it with the NY Magazine article which very much downplays it... Honestly, all that it would take for me to move the gay speculation section into triva while feeling academically honest would be for Cooper to say three words: "I'm not gay." That would trump all the speculation. But given the chance to, he said "I just don’t talk about my personal life." Well, the thing is that others <b>are</b> talking about his personal life (e.g. blogACTIVE). The comments are available for anyone to see if they do a quick google search; I really think this should be kept (though I am obviously a tad biased since I put it back&#160;;). -- <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimulus_9998.html" title="User:Limulus">Limulus</a> 20:51, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Exactly. If Andy is straight, why does he dodge the question? That's what I don't understand. To say that "we still don't have a word from [Anderson Cooper]" (as stated two entries above mine) implies that Cooper has never been asked about this, which would, in turn, imply that the paragraph Limulus refers to ("I just don’t talk about my personal life.") is a fabrication. Personally I don't care if he's gay or not, I still watch his show. I mean, he pays taxes...</dd>

<p>It just reads like tabloid fodder. Maybe if you clean it up a bit, the whole "many in the gay community..." comment in particular. What many? Who? Just random gays polled by the people at Gallup? And the "his handlers at CNN [are] known to call sites..." quote as well. I'd like to know where this was quoted from and have a direct link to the original document or at least reference it's source. And it's none of our business why he "dodges" the question. It's his life; let him live it. Until he says "I'm queer and here" from atop a broken levee, it is still just speculation. And poorly sourced speculation at that.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I accept your point regarding "many"; I'll tweak that in a moment. Please tell me what you think of the results. The "handlers at CNN" quote is directly from the blogACTIVE link. Perhaps I should get those two sentences to flow better. Him 'dodging the question' is now a matter of public record (via NY Metro article) and as such fair game.

<p><b>#</b> Here's another way to look at it: Presumably it doesn't really <i>matter</i> whether or not he's gay, <i>and</i> <b>he's made it plain that he doesn't want the matter to be part of discussion about him</b>.

<dd>If several sources had made that claim, it would be relevant to Blitzer just as it is with Anderson. A search on the topic on Google News gives a pretty clear indication of that. If you did it, it would be original research. In the case of Anderson, we give who has said what about the topic including Andersons POV, note the verifiability of the claim and that's it. Wikipedia should present both sides and not favor either of course. NPOV doesn't mean "Anderson Cooper's POV about his own life" either. Just as politicians and other visible figures may not want to discuss allegations about their personal life, they still might be high profile claims and would then be included in their article --<a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESketchee_ce7e.html" title="User:Sketchee">Sketchee</a> 03:45, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

The Cooper article he wrote was (based on the summaries I've read) not so much an outing of AC (Musto considers Cooper's sexuality an "open-secret") as an examination of why the mainstream press had tip-toed around his sexuality in various interviews up to that point (I think the NY Metro article was the first to speak about it in any meaningful way). Now, the curious thing is that I <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/gossip/story/287209p-245895c.html" class="external text" title="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/gossip/story/287209p-245895c.html" rel="nofollow">read</a> that the Daily News' gossip collumnist Ben Widdicombe actually spoke with AC about the article: "<i>I asked Cooper if he had been contacted about the story, which comes out next week. "No," he said, digging his hands into his pockets and looking at his shoes.</i> [note: Musto said "I asked CNN for a comment from Anderson and/or themselves. They apparently didn't even forward it to him, they just responded by sending me a blanket no comment."] <i>Any response to it? "No."</i>" Again, a chance for AC to tell the world that its complete fiction... And again, we get a 'no comment'.

And anyway, Anderson Cooper? Totally gay. Which is just too damn bad for us females. As for self-identifying, he doesn't wear the rainbow flag across his chest, but he's also never declared his heterosexuality or been seen squiring around ANY of NYC's myriad hot chicks in an would-be romantic capacity.

<dd>Heh, if there was something notable about the heterosexuality of a person I think it would definitely be noted in their article. I don't think it's "gossip" at all. Sections in my old school textbooks on Maurice Ravel (reportedly straight) and Tchaikovsky (reportedly gay) make note of the reports of the sexual preference of these individuals. These are general music history books. We make note that George Gershwin had a affair with Kay Swift. Encyclopedia and short bios often take note of these private affairs. Any good encyclopedia biography tries to give an overview not only of the persons professional life, but other events that shaped their lives, criticisms, media reports (that are sometimes false or disputed). These things aren't trivial (or trivia); it gives us a well rounded and NPOV perspective to include various sides. =) --<a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESketchee_ce7e.html" title="User:Sketchee">Sketchee</a> 08:36, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It just doesn't seem right for some reason. Something about the presentation. I'll think about it.</p>
<p>What's the BFD? I'm straight and a Christian. My wife and I watch Anderson Cooper almost every night. Why? Because he's a good reporter and he's not afraid to ask tough questions! If he wants to keep his sexuality private, why not let him? What would his being gay or straight have to do with his journalistic abilities? I'm a heavy metal musician and it doesn't lessen my admiration for their abilities one bit that <a href="../../../r/o/b/Rob_Halford_146c.html" title="Rob Halford">Rob Halford</a> of <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judas_Priest_a37d.html" title="Judas Priest">Judas Priest</a> is gay or that the late <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freddie_Mercury_ddca.html" title="Freddie Mercury">Freddie Mercury</a> was bisexual.

<p>He must be gay if he cant answer the question. I dont think its a big deal but people make it a big deal in shying away from answering the question. Most straight people have no issues with saying they are straight, its as easy as pie whether they are your next door neighbour or famous news anchors. Its the non straight folks that are challenged with stating their preferences. Hes probably gay... but it shouldn't matter anyway and really non of us should care.</p>
<p>As a public personality, many people are interested in sexual orientation, not to invade privacy. A professional astrologer did calculate his chart and rectify his rising sign and he definitely has a higher than normal sex drive, and if he was born in the morning between 8 AM and 11:30 AM, he definetly has planetary position of homosexuality that has been common in most gay celebrities' charts. However, it is not a planetary placement for a gay lover, but rather the type of gay man who likes gay sex for a psychological release or lust, etc. to say it discreetly, With Leo rising, Sun in 10th house of Public, and the North Node riding the crest of his medio coili, fame and public career are evident. But all of this is subject to correction of birth information and calculation of his fixed star placements, asteroids and black holes.</p>

Actually, Anderson was born between 3:00pm and 3:30pm.</p>

<dd>(I didnt write the two unsigned items above) I agree that a person's sexual orientation is not, in and of itself, relevant. However, in the context of how Cooper has answered this question, and the criticism he has goten for it in print from his colleagues, who have pointed to a lack of integrity, it is highly relevant. Perhaps more relevant than the widely-discussed issue of his injection of personal emotions into his reporting. How does he maintain his integrity by being emotional on camera in an interview with a public official on the one hand, and then (as one editor wrote in an editorial) "coyly" refuse to answer the question about his sexual orientation as a matter of keeping his private life out of the discussion to protect his journalistic abilities? So then why did he go on TV and talk about his mother? Why does he comment so much about his personal life to the absence of this one part of it, when a heterosexual commonly discusses their wives/husbands/children? It is indeed a question about his professional integrity, and in that context it is absolutely fair. If Cooper were to say his sexual orientation is different, and it is a special part of his personal life that he should be able to keep private apart from his mother, his father, and other parts of his memoirs devoid of any connection to his romantic life or his home life, then maybe you have something. He hasn't said it yet, and the question remains relevant. Just as the question was relevant for Cooper's colleague Wolf Blitzer to ask the Vice President about his daughter's pregnancy with her lesbian partner in the context of the Administration's vehement opposition to gay marriage. Cheney's reaction is fair game for public discussion, as was Blitzer asking it. The tendency to want to surpress or erase this under all circumstances, frankly, is the kind of thing editors must *resist*, not encourage.<a href="../../../n/y/d/User%7ENYDCSP_9b99.html" title="User:NYDCSP">NYDCSP</a> 21:36, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Checking the bios that we have on his ancestor, I don't see any trace of English heritage. The Vanderbilts came to America in 1650. If a family has been in a country for a few generations, that becomes their nation. When was Cooper's last ancestor born in England? -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 00:28, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's mostly a process of narrowing down. His most distant (listed) ancestor is <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornelius_Vanderbilt_074f.html" title="Cornelius Vanderbilt">Cornelius Vanderbilt</a>. The entry for him says he had some distant Dutch ancestry. None of the Vanderbilt's wives since Cornelius have even vaguely Dutch names (most are English) and one was even the daughter of a Presbyterian minister. Gloria Vanderbilt's entry says that she is of Spanish, Irish, English and Dutch descent. We know her Dutch is very distant, the Spanish part refers to her mother's maternal grandmother (thus Gloria would be 1/8th Spanish). I'm certain that Wyatt Cooper was of English descent as well. I'll add Irish to the article.<a href="../../../v/u/l/User%7EVulturell_6ce1.html" title="User:Vulturell">Vulturell</a> 00:37, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So Cooper is 1/16th Spanish? Are you sure that's Spanish, not Chilean? According to this article, <a href="../../../g/l/o/Gloria_Laura_Mercedes_Morgan-Vanderbilt_0eb7.html" title="Gloria Laura Mercedes Morgan-Vanderbilt">Gloria Laura Mercedes Morgan-Vanderbilt</a>, the Spanish connection is very distant. How many generations are necessary before a person is no longer a hyphenated American? -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 01:06, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, it's usually reported as "Spanish" and "Chilean" as if referring to two separate ethnic groups. But both are obviously referring to the same ancestor of Cooper's.</p>
<p>This is from the article on his maternal grandmother, <a href="../../../g/l/o/Gloria_Laura_Mercedes_Morgan-Vanderbilt_0eb7.html" title="Gloria Laura Mercedes Morgan-Vanderbilt">Gloria Laura Mercedes Morgan-Vanderbilt</a> "Gloria Morgan's maternal grandfather, Hugh Judson Kilpatrick (1836–1881), was a Union Army general during the American Civil War who also served as the U.S. minister to Chile where he met Gloria's grandmother, an aristocrat whose family are said to be descendants of Spain's royal house of Navarre." Obviously this Chilean grandmother of Morgan's was Spanish in ancestry; I didn't feel the need to mention <i>Chilean</i> for Anderson Cooper's ancestry, since Chilean is not really an ethnic background - it can refer to several things i.e. Native American/Spanish, just Spanish, etc. So he can be described as 1/16th Chilean or 1/16th Spanish - I just thought Spanish more accurately conveys it. To answer your question, it's not so much how many generations, but rather the exact ethnic makeup of a person - since no one is <i>really</i> American without some sort of a hyphen. The rules we usually use for these ethnic labels (i.e. <i>English-American</i>) is the person being at least 1/4 of whichever group. This limits the person to 4 groups. People like <a href="../../../v/a/l/Val_Kilmer_5daf.html" title="Val Kilmer">Val Kilmer</a> or <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Carradine_42d1.html" title="David Carradine">David Carradine</a>, who have such mixed ancestries that they don't even have a "full" quarter of anything, are not listed under any groups.<a href="../../../v/u/l/User%7EVulturell_6ce1.html" title="User:Vulturell">Vulturell</a> 01:26, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Do we have enough information to know that Cooper is even 1/4 English extraction? It sounds like a real mix. The Kingdom of Navarre ended in the 16th century, and was inhabited by Basques, so even calling that line "Spanish" is tenuous. Unless one of Cooper's four grandparents was born abroad, it seems safe to call him an un-hyphenated American. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 01:32, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Go for it. For less thoroughbred lineages, categories like "Americans with ____ ancestry", though wordy, might help distinguish those who were born in the U.S. to an ethnic family versus those who themselves immigrated. So, <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Hope_c9fc.html" title="Bob Hope">Bob Hope</a> would be one of the "English-Americans", <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sean_Hannity_4353.html" title="Sean Hannity">Sean Hannity</a> would be a one of "Americans with Irish ancestry", and Anderson Cooper would still be "Plain-old Americans" (comprising those whose most recent immigrant ancestor was a great-grandparent).

<dd>BTW, I was not aware "LOL" had become a cliche - that is disturbing information. Your idea may certainly work for the specific and much-hated "English Americans", but I think it might create a lot of confusion among most categories. "Irish-American", for example, is commonly known to define specifically Americans of Irish descent, not Irish-born. I guess English-Americans is just one category I should refrain from using that often if I don't want to annoy people.<a href="../../../v/u/l/User%7EVulturell_6ce1.html" title="User:Vulturell">Vulturell</a> 08:05, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>He has commented on it publicly, if only to deflect any sexual identification. Ergo, it should be part of the article. It is part of his persona for an article, which includes not only his work but also his public image, detailed biography, etc. It should stay in the article, as written, which is non POV and merely stating the facts, with Cooper's comments also.

<p>I too question the addition of 'former child fashion model' to Cooper's bio, and certainly in the first para. If you could point me to similar notables whose pre-teen careers as dogwalker, baby sitter, lawn mower or paper carrier is also highlighted in the first paragraph, I would be very interested to see it. The only exception should be those whose showbiz careers started as child actors or mouseketeers, for instance, or working models who began as child models.</p>
<p>I suggest its continuous re-inclusion in this page is the work of detractors (possibly even Aaron Brown) who feel Cooper is a journalistic lightweight and this is their way of making their not-so-subtle point.</p>

<p>It is widely rumored both within and outside of the gay community that Anderson Cooper is gay.

<dd>The quote from Cooper makes it very clear that (a) he was asked about the rumors, by a journalist from a major city magazine and (b) he answered it. Therefore, it belongs in the article, given the openness of the discussion. This is all properly cited. I'm pretty sure his PR people aren't deleting anything.

<p>How can we shorten the information so as to reduce the weight given to it? How about 'There has been some speculation over Anderson Cooper's sexuality (with cites) and he has declined to comment when questioned directly about it (inc cite)? I personally don't like Trivia sections as a rule, where would it fit best within the prose of the article?-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a><sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 20:27, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have moved the information where it once was, to its own section, just above Trivia. I do not believe that Cooper's non-denial can be mentioned without the context, ie who questioned him about it and why. Also, Cooper's response to New York magazine journalist Jonathan Van Meter makes it clear that declaring himself either gay or straight or otherwise would in some way jeopardize (the word he used is "threaten") his position as a journalist.<a href="../../../m/o/w/User%7EMowens35_1d6c.html" title="User:Mowens35">Mowens35</a> 20:32, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>But as it stands it is given far too much space in comparison to much more important and interesting information about him. We need to shorten it. Can you suggest a shortened version?-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a><sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 20:36, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I moved it to the end of the article, just above Trivia. How can that positioning be "far too much space" in comparison to "more important and interesting information"? Methinks you exaggerate. The section is 9 lines, half of which is his quote, therefore miniscule in comparison to nearly every other section. Intro is 5 lines; Background is 28 lines; Education is 4 lines; TV is 59 lines; Other Work is 7 lines; Awards is 9 lines; Sexuality speculation is 9 lines; and Trivia is 9 lines.

<dd>It is now 6 lines; it is as short as it can be. Are you satisfied now? Please say, yes, so we can move on to more important issues.

<dd>Well, I see it is a compromise. I personally don't think it should be included at all but you do. So as a compromise I have accepted a shortened and less prominent version. However, I do think that we don't really need the quote. Simply stating that he declined to confirm or deny the speculation would be better as far as I can see (it reduces the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">weight</a> given to the section. If you want to discuss his ideas regarding his role as a journalist I think these should be separated and not part of this factoid.
<dl>
<dd>I have compromised; I have moved the section and shortened it. Anything else is going beyond compromise and into arm-twisting, which you must surely see. I think it is fine now as is. I am a journalist myself and understand that when an article is written, a blanket statement cannot be used without affirmation, hence the quote. It is fine now. <a href="../../../m/o/w/User%7EMowens35_1d6c.html" title="User:Mowens35">Mowens35</a> 21:03, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wow, I thought we had agreed to remove speculation from this section and shorten it into something that wasn't given undue weight? Why then, do we now have a large chunk of information about some comedian using Anderson Cooper as the punchline in a joke? IT IS A JOKE!! It should not be taken seriously as speculation. Why is it here? Who says it is the most widely reported example?</p>
<p>This has just proven to me that you have no concept of the number of people on this site who do not think there should be idle speculation about Anderson Cooper's sexuality in this article. Have a look through the history - you will see various people removing the information, including someone just 2 days after our discussion. You have not stuck to our compromise, you have just gone back to expanding the section with as much juicy rumour and speculation as possible.

<dd>I am not one of the main editors of this article, but I do have it on my watch list. And I do not wish to get in a revert war. It comes down and goes back up. My point in responding to you earlier as that there is a joke yes, but its in a context in which I think it actually satisfies someone who was reading the article as there has been continual rumors to his sexuality, which at this point is a part of who he is and thus background information. Now if I had written this article, would I have included it, probably not. Because I never knew one way or the other before I read this. Thus my ambiguity to action one way or the other. <a href="../../../i/m/m/User%7EImmunity_1f16.html" title="User:Immunity">immunity</a> 04:50, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I realize I may have upset some people just now, but I have added back material on the issue of Cooper's sexuality that is derived entirely from verifiable, credible sources that are properly cited, and even in one case the source's notability is defended by third-party sources (ABCNews and USN&amp;WP to be precise), and it puts the question in, I think, the proper context given the discussion that has taken place here. Nothing about jokes or gossip websites or rumors. Simply content derived entirely from legitimate sources, placed NPOV. The NY Magazine interview was indeed significant, since it was in a credible publication that utilizes I think proper editorial processes for its content, and it was also an occasion where Cooper himself addressed this issue. And the fact that it prompted a critical editorial from one of the most important gay news publications in the United States is, I feel, of unquestionable relevance, particularly given the context that the editorial raised which was excerpted. This isn't just about his personal life, it is about how questions about his personal life feed into publicly raised questions about his integrity.

<dd>This content is from the subject's own comments on the record, in a verifiable source that is also used in other parts of the article about the subject's family, experiences, et al. The sourced content (not the editor's wording, but the original wording of the sourced content excerpted and cited) refers to other published material on the subject and/or an incident which occured on-air involving the subject, and subsequent public dispute over what he said. The sourced content (not the editor's wording -- the original content that is sourced and linked to a verifiable location where the published content originated, and it is FURTHER defended as a notable, relevant source from two ADDITIONAL sources, namely ABC News and US News and World Report) also is an editorial (not a gossip column) calling the subject's integrity into question on the topic of the content from the first source. And all of it refers to how the subject's refusal to discuss his personal life (see the section title??) is related to his integrity and reliability as a journalist, and then includes BALANCE (hello, NPOV?) including criticism which uses the subject's words to call his integrity into question. This is about one of the most prominent journalists in the world. Do I have to continue? Frankly, I find the objections at this point to be the POV problem, not the content.

<p>Hi all.

The second paragraph remains, as it is about Mr Cooper directly. Please do not re-add the first paragraph, however well referenced you can make it, as it is not directly about Anderson Cooper. The complainant also asked that all discussion of the topic be removed, but that's going too far.. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a></small> 10:31, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks, Proto. I hope the content that is now in this section gives the proper context to this issue of Cooper's personal life, and its relationship to his role as a journalist, as he himself has stated in the content which you left in place. I agree it is going too far to remove the topic altogether, as fellow journalists (both Van Meter, and the editor of one of the leading and influential gay newspapers, for example) feel it is indeed a fair topic. I agree with your decision, and with others, that including references from jokes or sitcoms or the "cultural zeitgeist" or gossip websites are questionable. There is a very big difference between fighting over whether one "wants" Cooper to be gay or straight - that's not for WP -- and the relevance of Cooper's own public comments on the matter, in response to specific material previously written in credible publications, and the response from Cooper's journalistic colleagues to his comments.<a href="../../../n/y/d/User%7ENYDCSP_9b99.html" title="User:NYDCSP">NYDCSP</a> 20:45, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(copied my comment from NTDCSP's talk page) Upon review of the 'Personal Life' section, I note it is just speculation, and so five paragraphs (even if referenced) seems like serious overkill, and probably skewing the article out of a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral treatment of the subject</a>. There was no anonymous removals of the section when it was just a simple referenced paragraph stating (paraphrasing) 'there has been speculation but Cooper has denied it'. This is all the article still states, although takes five long paragraphs to do so. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a></small> 09:46, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(copied from my talk page in response)But it prompted serious criticism from a notable source, raising doubts about the subject's integrity as a journalist in a manner directly related to the subject's own comments on the matter. The editor has blanked out the entire section without comment. You are supposing something here, when in fact it would be the editor's responsibility to explain themselves, or to otherwise engage other editors on the talk page to discuss this matter if it is controversial to him or her before blanking it all out. I would raise the unspoken complaint here -- I would counter your supposition with another. What if this is someone connected to CNN who is worried that this NPOV content from notable sources will interfere with their multi-million dollar marketing campaign of Mr Cooper? What if, in addition, other editors wish to supress notable content from a notable source such as The Washington Blade because of an anti-gay bias? I think you also must weigh those suppositions with the same weight as the one you have put forth here. And in the end, they are all suppositions because this blanking is going on anonymously, and cannot rule the day here. I recognize this may upset some of Mr Cooper's fans, as well as him personally, but WP official policy says that cannot be considered if the information is not libelous or slanderous (it is obviously not), from notable and verifiable sources and properly cited. What's more, since Mr Cooper HIMSELF raised the matter of his personal life being something he "doesn't talk about" or discuss, and a notable source has in turn raised a question here about his integrity on that very point, and a journalist's integrity is everything. If you blank that out, I would say you are ELIMINATING the balance of the section. And you are, in my view as an editor, engaging in censorship on behalf of a subject's commercial and financial interests (given the content in question) rather than allowing for balance under your own rules of the road, as well as perhaps siding with homophobes who wish to supress sourced content from a publication like the Washington Blade, which is a verifiable and notable source which has run an editorial on this subject's integrity as a journalist over this specific issue! And both would be a possible subject for a press article, to be honest. Then, would you still repress it? <a href="../../../n/y/d/User%7ENYDCSP_9b99.html" title="User:NYDCSP">NYDCSP</a> 14:12, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In a biographical article of a very prominent person, which is completely devoid of criticism, to cut out the one critical part of it is, in my view, very unbalanced and it is an effort to stop the article from being improved. New York Magazine, from its editor on down, found it appropriate to run that paragraph in the article, plus Cooper's reply. To remove the introductory paragraph to Cooper's comments cuts out the necessary content to understand both Cooper's reply, and Kevin Naff's criticism in response. I think this section is as short as possible to include the bare-bones information. And if it makes Mr Cooper, his network marketing department, and his fans uncomfortable, I'm sorry. But that's not a reason under WP's own rules, to delete it or to down-play its relevance. <a href="../../../n/y/d/User%7ENYDCSP_9b99.html" title="User:NYDCSP">NYDCSP</a> 14:47, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How about we try and pare it down a little. How is this? My notes in <i>italics</i>.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Cooper's sexual orientation has been the subject of public speculation. In a September 2005 article by Jonathan Van Meter in New York magazine, it was reported that there has been "chatter" about Cooper's sexuality. <i>(ref - no need to quote the paragraph)</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Van Meter asked Cooper about the public speculation on his sexual orientation, and he replied: "You know, I understand why people might be interested. But I just don’t talk about my personal life. It’s a decision I made a long time ago, before I ever even knew anyone would be interested in my personal life. The whole thing about being a reporter is that you're supposed to be an observer and to be able to adapt with any group you’re in, and I don’t want to do anything that threatens that." <i>(ref)</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Cooper's comment in the article led the editor of a leading newspaper for the gay and lesbian community <i>(ref)</i>, The Washington Blade, to pen an editorial criticizing Cooper and other celebrities for "choosing the closet over honesty." <i>(ref)</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dd><i>The last sentence and quote isn't specific to Cooper, so could probably be excised.</i></dd>

<dd>I would have to say no it wouldn't because the last sentence is indeed specific to Cooper. The "he" he refers to is Cooper, and a reader can go to the article and clearly see that. It also gives context to the issue not being just about Cooper's sexuality, but the statement he is making (so argues the editor of the Blade) by refusing to answer the question. Otherwise it cheapens the context as if this content is just about Cooper's sex life, which it is *not*. (If it was, I would agree that it was overkill). It is about his *notable* refusal to discuss a profound aspect of his identity and it raises questions about his integrity as a result because *he* claims it is related to his integrity and effectiveness as a journalist. In turn, Naff asks what it is about being gay that would threaten that. I think the editing you suggest would have the unfortunate result of turning the current content into exactly what you want to avoid - that this is about Anderson Cooper's sex life, rather than about his identity - simply because you want to reduce the number of characters and lines. <a href="../../../n/y/d/User%7ENYDCSP_9b99.html" title="User:NYDCSP">NYDCSP</a> 16:49, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We need to reduce it down. As I have said, why should this article dedicate 10% of itself to speculation? His life does not revolve around speculating about his sexuality.

<dd>Correction, it is not only about speculation. By the subject's own words in a sourced reference, it is about his ability to do his job as a journalist. HE brought this subject to that level, and for that reason it is highly relevant, highly due the space it is afforded, highly NPOV from an editor's standpoint, and given the entire article's failure to include anything else critical of this highly prominent individual, who grills public officials on a regular basis, the portion of this section which deals with the criticism he received for HIS comments on the subject, provide necessary balance to the subject's own views on the subject. I worry that the repeated 'cleansing' of this matter, even when it objectively fits WP criteria, is becoming the NPOV problem here. <a href="../../../n/y/d/User%7ENYDCSP_9b99.html" title="User:NYDCSP">NYDCSP</a> 17:29, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In reality, the criticism brought by the Washington Blade referred to Mr Cooper's own statement in response to published 'speculation' - perhaps even 'allegation' since Michael Musto has come out and said it, but let's stay with 'speculation'. And this, coming from the editor-in-chief of what two cited sources (in what you deleted) independently vouched for its notability, and therefore is a matter of journalistic integrity, not sex life. We're not even talking about a scandal! And yet WP:BLP says even that would be permitted if it fit Example Two. The Washington Blade and New York Magazine have both published the 'allegation'/'speculation', Mr Cooper commented on the latter in the same article, and the former reacted to those comments in how they impact Mr Cooper's integrity as a journalist. Your repeated deletion of THIS content (not the previous content, this is the first time THIS has been added) does not hold up as being consistent with WP:BLP. And what's more, saying "this stands" in such a unilateral fashion makes it almost impossible to assume good faith, but I will hang onto it.<a href="../../../n/y/d/User%7ENYDCSP_9b99.html" title="User:NYDCSP">NYDCSP</a> 20:20, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Talk%7EAnderson_Cooper_Archive_1_8eea.html" title="Edit section: &quot;This [section] is about Anderson Cooper's identity, not his sex life&quot;, and the Washington Blade">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">"This [section] is about Anderson Cooper's identity, not his sex life", and the Washington Blade</span></h2>
<p>After another message on my talk page, I have looked into this in more detail. Sorry, NYDCSP, the section as you want it to be is <i>about his sex life</i>, and nothing but. Certainly not his "identity". The entire section headed 'Personal life' does not discuss his family, it does not discuss his hobbies, his hopes, his likes, his dislikes, his favourite kind of cake, anything. All it discusses, for five paragraphs, is gossip about Anderson Cooper's sexuality. It shouldn't even be called "Personal life", as it's misleading; in your version, it may as well be called "Anderson Cooper is gay". Brimba has pared this down. He may have been overeager to cut it down, but right now you are very keen on including the entirety of the gossip from the <i>Washington Blade</i>.</p>
<p>You then include two references to justify the Washington Blade as being a relevant and major news source. The first link, from ABC news, is dead. No such destination exists on their website. The second is a passing mention as being 'influential' in a "wicked whisper" gossip column. I would humbly suggest that this is not sufficient to establish the <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Blade_0dc6.html" title="Washington Blade">Washington Blade</a> as a major and relevant news source, and I believe this is why Brimba removed the information. Pursuant to <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, which requires great care when it comes to biographies of living persons, I agree with him. <b>There is no evidence the <i>Washington Blade</i> is a significant, non-trivial, reliable source</b>.</p>
<p>(Incidentally, the article on the paper itself (<a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Blade_0dc6.html" title="Washington Blade">Washington Blade</a>) will end up being deleted if it doesn't improve, incidentally, as it doesn't assert why this newspaper is notable, at all.)</p>
<p>Finally, we have an opinion piece from the aforementioned Washington Blade. The chunk quoted in the article is 90% of what related to Cooper in the editorial (it's almost a trivial mention). It assumes Anderson Cooper is gay, and effectively labels him a hypocrite. I would suggest that this is unnecessary to an encyclopaedia, and does not need to be there. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a></small> 20:31, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>At no point do we have verification from Cooper or any other reliable source that he is in fact gay, only speculation. Speculation is not encyclopedic, nor does it have any room in WP. Speculation is only encyclopedic when becomes newsworthy in and of itself. For example if someone was sued by a former companion, or related to some public scandal. To let stand allegations that Cooper or Jodi Foster, or Shepard Smith or anyone else is gay, without proof is clearly a violation of WP:BLP. Cooper was asked, and gave a classic non-answer. That is as much as we can report at this point. The Washington Blade was not speculating that Cooper is gay, they said outright that he is, and called him a hypocrite. Without a reliable source to back that up, we can not use it. We know nether their source, nor their agenda</p>
<p>We have an obligation to make certain that WP is not seen as a vehicle that can be used to “Out” people, or in any other way be used to damage or smear people. Some outings are legitimate, and some are simply smears, and it is beyond the ability of the average editor to determine which is which. The advantage of including such allegations, or in other words the usefulness to the average user of WP, is minimal at best. The liability in terms of negative press and loss of credibility is huge. Policy exists for a reason, and until it changes, this material is out. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrimba_6849.html" title="User:Brimba">Brimba</a> 21:34, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are not empowered to make decisions by fiat, Brimba. You can add your view, but I'll ask for constructive, civil actions, even if you're forceful in your comments in this discussion. Whats more, your interpretation of WP:BLP (I say interpretation because you have yet to cite anything explicit related to one's sexual orientation to back it up from the policy) assumes that being identified as being gay, or even speculated as such, as per the example I laid out from WP:BLP (that referred to infidelity scandal, arguably much more a clear problem subject) is a "smear" or in some way imperils Wikipedia legally. I'm sorry, but that's patently ridiculous. Explain how that can be, please. You have also said yourself some outing is ok. Who makes that decision on Wikipedia?? I never once advocated "outing" Mr Cooper. That's not my interest here. I am just trying to do my best as an editor to place sourced content from reliable, verifiable third-parties that I still argue (and can provide even more and more and more cited evidence if you all need it) are *notable* under WP poicy and guidelines, and refer to Mr Cooper's integrity and, if you want to go there, someone notable has called him hypocritical (although I left that for the reader to see for themselves by linking). And I admit the content is critical of Mr Cooper, but this article is pretty devoid of any criticism of him as of now. To me this is unbalanced. I am not going on a fishing trip to find other suitable criticisms to make my point (that pass the "no gay rule")-- I came across this material myself over due course and found it compelling, and well within the rules, and highly relevant. I find the intensity of the two or three folks coming at it with many, many (I believe) flawed citations of WP policy to be very interesting in and of itself. But it hasn't changed my mind a bit. I also think this is not something that can be solved over two days. It should allow for other editors to at least read if not decide to weigh in on the discussion.</dd>

<p>The section is very problematic and I have removed it. A section on the subject's "Personal life" only includes an article where someone speculated about him being a homosexual? What kind of rationale could support that under <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>? None.</p>
<p>Folks, very few if any famous media personalities have not been subject to speculation about their sexual practices. "Editors should be on the lookout for biased or malicious content in biographies or biographical information. If someone appears to be pushing an agenda or a biased point of view, insist on reliable third-party published sources <u>and a clear demonstration of relevance to the person's notability</u>." At bottom, including the speculation <i>is simply not relevant to Cooper's notability.</i></p>
<p>Also, in a section "Personal life", it presents a <a href="../../../u/n/d/WP%7EUndue_weight_9fd9.html" title="WP:Undue weight">WP:Undue weight</a> problem.</p>
<p>The info should be excluded until such time as the subject himself specifically "outs", at which point it will become relevant to his notability.</p>
<p>But speculation about it - again, nearly every media personality alive has been subject of such speculation, and even such things as penis size, whether they provide oral sex to partners, spit or swallow, etc. - <u>is simply not relevant to Cooper's notability</u>.</p>
<p>Sure, it may be "interesting" to some in a sort of gawking way, but Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a tabloid.</p>

<p>This is a fairly short article. Too much coverage of the gay rumors would unbalance it. A few lines about the existence of the rumors and his response to them are sufficient. I don't think we need to quote anyone, we can just summarize the material briefly. I'd like to compare this to the <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clay_Aiken_b79b.html" title="Clay Aiken">Clay Aiken</a> article. That subject likewise is the subject of widespread rumors, jokes, and even one guy trying to publicize a supposed lurid encounter. The issue is very important to the "fandom" and editing mayhem ensued. Several admins got involved (including me) and we eventually developed material that stuck mostly to the on-screen incidents and to his statements, and that's been enforceable. In Cooper's case there are fewer incidents and statements, but it should still stick to what's neutral. The sitcom joke, only heard by a few hundred people, seems very ephemeral. The <i><a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Blade_0dc6.html" title="Washington Blade">Washington Blade</a></i> may be notable, but its opinion is not notable enough to quote at length. Let's just use those as one of the sources for saying that his sexuality is a matter of debate, but that he maintains his privacy. Wikipedia is a long term project - sooner or later we'll be able to say more. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> · <a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWill_Beback_e8d4.html" title="User talk:Will Beback">†</a> · 07:02, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The editor of the Washington Blade, Kevin Naff, has publicly responded to some of the comments above on the Blade Blog. <a href="http://www.washblade.com/blog/index.cfm?type=blog&amp;start=2/2/07&amp;end=2/5/07#11190" class="external free" title="http://www.washblade.com/blog/index.cfm?type=blog&amp;start=2/2/07&amp;end=2/5/07#11190" rel="nofollow">http://www.washblade.com/blog/index.cfm?type=blog&amp;start=2/2/07&amp;end=2/5/07#11190</a>.

<dd>Yes, I've read it. Mr Naff's article is a bit of a reality check about how the Blade is indeed notable, and that Wikipedia is, in fact, not; and this discussion thread and this article are glowing examples of why. No wonder Wikipedia cannot be cited as a source on itself. It is an inherently unreliable source of accurate information and always will be given its model, so why do any of us care? I surely care less now, given how I could write endlessly on this talk page making arguments that arguably hew to the rules, and still have people deleting notable, third party, cited content in response and saying there is no argument here, end of story, my ruling stands, your content is cheap gossip, homosexuality clearly referenced in notable sources is salicious and private and let's straight-wash a profile already completely devoid of criticism (even when the mention is part of a larger question of the subject's professional integrity). Under your rules, Monica Lewinksy could not have been mentioned on Bill Clinton's bio until he finally "came out" about it. And that story, I would add, WAS salacious. But by clear implication from all of you folks here, a homosexual identity is something so negative, so spurious, a "smear", so "damaging" that even when a subject refers to it obliquely in response to a reporter's question from widespread public speculation based on the subject's OWN PUBLIC BEHAVIOR, you still say it's too horrifying to add, too "damaging" and "unbalanced" against the rest of this article. Damaging to whom? A multi-millionaire? How? To his network? How? As Mr Naff says in his new column, it all raises more questions that are, in my eyes, fair game to raise about a highly-highly paid journalist who has himself commented on the connection between this subject and his job.</dd>

<dd>OK - I'm done, kids. This discussion thread speaks for itself. No one should care this much about Wikipedia as I have in this case. And Mr Naff's new column says it all more articulately than I ever could as to why this website is not an encyclopedia, never will be, and all those who vainly think it is are kidding themselves.

<dd>If Cooper was asked, in numerous interviews, about his dislike of pancakes, and consistently said he didn't want to talk about pancakes, we would have an entire section on the "pancake conroversy". His sexuality is clearly controversial; Wikipedia can easily mention this controversy without contributing to specualtion. This page shows it is of interest to people, and it should be included for the person who comes to Wikipedia to research a rumour they may have heard.
<dl>
<dd>Rubbish. Firstly, pancake obsession is not notable. Secondly, pancake obsession is not controversial, at least not that a reasonable person would want it kept out of the public eye.

<dd>Did I say that AC is gay? No. "Some well-known sources say AC is gay, both in public and in print." That's not whispered rumors. They have committed it to print. THAT can be and has been verified. As per 'what business is it of ours' we can ask that of the people who reported it; e.g. click the BlogActive link and see why he mentions it. He is very clearly NOT doing it to be malicious. As an aside, one might ask (with admittedly more obvious answers) 'what business is it of ours that George Allen had Jewish ancestors' or 'Strom Thurmond had a black daughter' because that touches on their personal lives and <i>neither of those things is wrong</i>... This is what the WB ME had issue with in calling some of the reasons for the removal "homophobic". As per libel or defamation, the claim that others have made, that 'AC is gay' would have to be untrue, but AC refuses to say one way or the other and there are people making that positive claim. The fact that those people have put it on record should absolve us of either if we maintain a NPOV and stick to the facts that I listed. -- <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimulus_9998.html" title="User:Limulus">Limulus</a> 21:31, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Concerning the violation of WP:AGF I will say this. I am the author of most of the comments quoted with the editorial. In my lifetime I can never remember a time before when I have been described as Homophobic. I have had a gay roommate in the past, one who was openly and publicly gay, he was a good guy, and I could not see any reason for it being an issue. I have also had another roommate sometime before this whom I assumed to be gay. He never said. It was his life and none of my business unless he decided to make it my business. I also know from past experience what it is like to have been “outed” when you where never “in”. I know what it is like to have the same roommate for so long that people begin to assume that there is more to the story. I know what it is like to have a friend who is gay show up at work and then become the source of gossip at the office. You can not disprove it, the best thing you can do is to keep your mouth shut. And lastly I know what it is like to be interested in someone who is female, who already “knows” that you are gay, because everyone knows it. And that last part is the problem. If it where not for that, I suppose it would not be an issue.</p>
<p>Attempting to force someone into a nice neat box for your own benefit, or the benefit of your argument is morally indefensible. People have a right to be themselves, if they choose to place themselves into a box, then that is their choice. We have zero proof, all we have is speculation. And beyond that it is not for us to second guess an individual and his choice. Does it sometimes happen, yes, it does. The fact that it happens at other times mean that we are obligated to allow it to happen here? No we are under no such obligation.</p>
<p>Now getting back to WP. We have policy, policy that is spelled out in detail, which anyone can read. We do not change those policies because someone calls us names. We do not bend because it is expedient at that particular moment to do so. They where created based upon past experience so that we would have something to guide us in just this type of case.</p>
<p>WP:BLP states clearly: <b>We must get the article right.</b> Be very firm about high quality references, particularly about details of personal lives. Unsourced or poorly sourced controversial <b>(negative, positive, or just highly questionable) material about living persons should be removed immediately from Wikipedia articles</b>, talk pages, and user pages. … The responsibility for justifying controversial claims in Wikipedia, of all kinds, but especially for living people's bios, rests firmly on the <b>shoulders of the person making the claim</b>.</p>
<p>We do not source to blogs, nor to op-ed piece that are highly POV. We do not reference speculation, unless that speculation itself has become highly newsworthy. A simple search of Google News shows this has not occurred, contrary to the argument made above. No major news service has picked it up, nor has any minor news source, infact no one has except for WB. Whatever the perceive notability of the “conflict” between WP and the WB, no one has made reference to it. In the end we hold to policy, because we have policy, and we have it for a reason.</p>
<p>Somehow this talk page is itself deemed notable within AC’s Bio. I am sorry, it escapes me entirely as to how that could be. Nor is the dubious “but it has been further claimed that discussion of Cooper's sexuality is increasingly seen as a liability to his career, and so is no longer publicly acknowledged: "[H]is handlers at CNN... [are] known to call sites and ask editors to delete references to Anderson Cooper being gay".” Strange, I guess Ted lost my number somehow. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrimba_6849.html" title="User:Brimba">Brimba</a> 00:01, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Um, Brimba, did you notice that your comment was the one Kevin Naff called "blatantly homophobic"? That would kind of make it a conflict of interest that you edited away that reference, wouldn't it? But anyway, we're slowly moving in the right direction. You also used "public speculation" twice, so I'll fix that in a sec. Also, if we're going to get this back to trivia+1 status it should be merged into the main article; the background section is a good place for it since that's also where there are quotes about Cooper talking about his brother. -- <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimulus_9998.html" title="User:Limulus">Limulus</a> 00:30, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree, although because there has discussion about this in some news sources, it <i>MAY</i> qualify for mention in this article.

<dd>Can I ask why we are even discussing this? Because some people think he's gay? Because he refuses to comment about the issue?

I don't see how this is any less relevant to the article than the entries stating that he has Dutch ancestors or two half brothers.

<dd>Being from a certain country is a basic piece of information, establishing Heritage. Sexual Orientation is far different than what country one is from. The point is if he's gay or not, who cares? That is like putting an asteriks on someones name under a list of 'great journalists' and at the bottom putting *=Homosexual. Stating that it was "chatter", I feel expresses the fact that no official statement has been made from Cooper or his representatives on the subject, so no matter how many people SAY he's gay and publish it, it is still for all intents and purposes speculation. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECascadia_2509.html" title="User:Cascadia"><b>Cascadia</b></a><a href="../../../c/a/s/User_talk%7ECascadia_41b3.html" title="User talk:Cascadia"><font color="#2F4F2F"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps;"><b>TALK</b></sup></font></a><font color="#2F4F2F"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps;">|</sup></font><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cascadia_299d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cascadia"><font color="#2F4F2F"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps;"><b>HISTORY</b></sup></font></a> 18:51, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't see how someone's sexuality isn't basic information too. I don't know about the US Census, but it's collected by the Canadian one. You might not find it terribly important, but the reality is that a public figure's sexuality is highly relevant to most people whether it should be or not. The homosexuality of someone like Rock Hudson, though he never stepped up and stated it was so, is indespensible in understand him as a person. It is true that all of this is really just speculation, but I think we should understand that issues like these usually are built on speculation until the individual confirms or denies it, and even then, it may still be up in the air. Anderson Cooper's sexuality may not be something we can confirm undoubtably, but I think the speculation of his sexuality is certainly far more notable than indicated by this article.</dd>

<dd>My point was that all three (ancestry, siblings and sexual orientation) are basic pieces of biographical information. Hiding that because there are people who consider "gay" to be a pejorative does not seem to be any better than if we were for similar reasons to hide the fact that someone had jewish ancestry or mixed race relatives. If a 'great journalist' from the US was gay, should Should Wikipedia NOT use the "LGBT people from the United States" category at the bottom of their entry? Should Wikipedia scrap the "Gay actors" or "Gay musicians" categories? As per "speculation" and "chatter" your comment runs contrary to the entire concept of journalism. -- <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimulus_9998.html" title="User:Limulus">Limulus</a> 20:20, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well as I see it we are almost there with this issue. However, as it stands it just doesn't make sense as there is no context. It states that he has denied to answer questions about his sexuality but doesn't mention anything about why this is important. We need to have a brief mention of the fact that it has been talked about. What we want is a brief - 2 sentences - analysis of the entire situation, avoiding being overly verbose.-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a><sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 20:31, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Perhaps we can sidestep the above with another simple biographical fact not mentioned in the article: Cooper has never married. That would make a good lead-in to the 'unfinished thought' that now exists and would make it more appropriate for the background section... -- <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimulus_9998.html" title="User:Limulus">Limulus</a> 13:28, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sexual orientation is very well known to be a highly charged subject as of today (10-Feb-2007), and there is no reason why a website purporting itself to be an encyclopedia should take it upon itself to use copy from a very few recently published sources to speculate upon the sexual orientation of a subject of a Wikipedia biography. While Wikipedia defines itself as being superior to a periodically printed encyclopedia because it can be more current, and in fact online and 'instant', it also defines rules of editorship which encourage it to be circumspect and cautious with facts because of that reason. Time always yields more information. Where does the rush to define or infer the sexual orientation of a biographical subject come from? Is Wikipedia more concerned with being 'current', as in the sense of a periodical or tabloid, or is it more concerned with being 'right', as described in its own guidelines? As with other subjects such as David Bowie and Mick Jagger, time will tell as to what the reportage of sexual orientation should be in a given biography. But in the meantime, intense efforts toward one view or another need to be closely examined for their political motives, which must not hold sway in regards to constructing biographies, and in particular, current biographies. Again, in reading Wikipedia's own self-definition, it holds itself to be superior to printed encyclopedias because it does not have to wait years until the next edition is published. However, if Wikipedia chooses to call itself an encyclopedia, then it must avoid 'tabloidization.' The personal lives of public figures are long and varied. Despite the ability of Wikipedia to paste in and out the current activities of public figures, is that really the mission of a website claiming to be an encyclopedia?</p>

<dd>Unlike prior versions which mentioned his sexuality, the edits you deleted were based almost entirely around the quote from AC himself; how you can argue that this is 'speculation' is beyond me. Suicide is also a "charged subject" BTW; should we omit all traces of Carter's and its influence on AC? I agree that Wikipedia should not be a tabloid, but at the same time it should not be a fanclub either. -- <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimulus_9998.html" title="User:Limulus">Limulus</a> 10:30, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As you might check in my profile, I was the person requesting the initial edit of his biography and the compliance of the regulations. It is very disappointing to see, how this topic has been managed without good faith, and capitalized by other gossip sites and magazines for their own profit and promotion.</p>
<p>My initial request was based in the WP:BLP policy that stated:</p>
<p><i>WP:BLP states clearly: We must get the article right. Be very firm about high quality references, particularly about details of personal lives. Unsourced or poorly sourced controversial (negative, positive, or just highly questionable) material about</i> living persons should be removed immediately from Wikipedia articles, talk pages, and user pages. <i>… The responsibility for justifying controversial claims in Wikipedia, of all kinds, but especially for living people's bios, rests firmly on the shoulders of the person making the claim.</i></p>
<p>The editor considered it to be too much, and the talk page remain the same, becoming a widespread source of speculation, and ultimately a joke, mining the credibility of the Wiki project. There is proof of lack of good faith of some of the people editing the entry, they plan their edits in gay gossip forums, Datalounge:10 Years of Gay Gossip, Politics and Pointless Bitchery, <a href="http://www.datalounge.com/cgi-bin/iowa/forum/thread/gossip/4446708/page-2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.datalounge.com/cgi-bin/iowa/forum/thread/gossip/4446708/page-2.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, where they have a thread for this issue, they contact people in the media ( as the Blade blogger ) in order to take the issue mainstream and pressure the editors of this site to bend the policies and give in to their request in sheer violation of Mr. Cooper's rights. For many it has become a hobbie to stir things up over this discussion page in order to crawl back to their forums and blogs and keep their entertainment and gossip alive.</p>
<p>Now you, Wikipedia, are facing an open call from another gossip site - gawker.com - to flood the entry.<a href="http://gawker.com/news/anderson-cooper/is-anderson-coopers-wikipedia-entry-being-straightwashed-237444.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://gawker.com/news/anderson-cooper/is-anderson-coopers-wikipedia-entry-being-straightwashed-237444.php" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>.</p>

If so, on what grounds? (verifiability, NPOV or original research?) Or are you bothered by the fact that the <i>talk page</i> is not? Talk pages aren't the same as main article pages, so if its the latter, I don't think you have a valid complaint. -- <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimulus_9998.html" title="User:Limulus">Limulus</a> 10:07, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
