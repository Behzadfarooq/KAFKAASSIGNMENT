<p>1. "and perhaps the unfairness of presenting a child in early adolescence with choices dodged as too difficult by parents and physicians 12 years earlier." (listed as a con for the non-surgical approach)</p>
<p>What about the unfairness of taking those choices away? I see no such ethical musings listed in favor of the non-surgical approach. And how is leaving a descision, difficult or otherwise, to the person you belive has the exclusive right to make it "dodging" it.</p>
<p>2."This most obvious birth defect, somewhat midway between male and female, nearly always leads to referral to a pediatric endocrinologist and a full genetic, anatomic, and hormonal evaluation.</p>
<p>I admit this may not be POV simply on the grounds that the language is so difficult to understand. Somewhere between male and female there exists a most obvious birth defect. What's defective? Is the article talking abour troublesome hypospadias, because thats not limited to Reifenstein syndrome. -Annonymous February 18 2006</p>
<p>Thank you for spelling out your criticisms. Note that I already integrated at least two of your suggested changes. Here are my responses to the above.</p>
<ol>
<li>Gender is in nearly all cases of normal or abnormal genitalia assigned by parents and doctors at birth. This is simply what is done for your basic baby whose genitalia are either normal or the more common types of abnormal. Most congenital anomalies of the genitalia are simply repaired in infancy. The potential disadvantages of this are clearly stated: some people want to change sex and this may result in everyone involved regretting that surgery in infancy was done or engaging in additional surgery, and many people complain of reduced sexual function. How can it be put more clearly? The delayed surgery choice may be especially appropriate for this middle degree of AIS. It is given more space than the traditional approach, and its putative advantages are mentioned but the potential drawbacks should be also. We dont have much experience with this option yet.</li>
<li>"This most obvious birth defect, midway between..." refers to the most intermediate degrees of AIS (once referred to as Reifenstein syndrome). Among the problems produced by it: micropenis with poor response to testosterone treatment, reduced fertility, urinary problems, inability to engage as readily as desired in the most common types of sexual intercourse desired, parental uncertainty and distress over assignment, social stress, distressing experiences with medical care, etc. These problems are objective and described by the people with the condition, regardless of whether someone else thinks it should be perceived as a problem or not. Management decisions for the complete or nearly complete degrees and the mild degrees are easy in comparison to these. That is why the management options are described for each form separately. I thought it was clear that this section referred to the intermediate degrees, but I will look at the text again and make it even clearer.</li>
<li>Finally, <i>everyone's</i> view on this is a "POV". It is the people who claim not to have one but want to censor the others from the list that are most annoying. Unlike some of the editors on this project, I do not have enough omniscience, prescience, limited imagination, or hubristic certainty to claim that I know which choice is definitely the best. I will clearly state my POV, which is based on substantial experience: there is no such thing as a universal "best" management for all infants and families, only a choice between which potential problems to reduce or accept. Finally, I am not opposed to newer choices and have even recommended them, but I am not naively optimistic that they will prove problem-free-- just different problems. Finally, may I suggest you make an account and help improve the more incomplete articles, of which there are many? It will help your understanding of what goes into this as well as my responses. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 02:45, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<p><br />
I still find 2 confusing, why not just explain like you did here?</p>
<p>1 is still POV the possible "unfairness" of "dodging" the decision is not contrasted againt the unfairness of taking that descision away. No finger wagging need be done in the direction of the parents and doctors to explain that making such choices may be difficult for an adolescent. It is not an objective fact that it is their descision to make, hence by passing it off to their child they should not be said to be "dodging" it because it is "too difficult", any more than I should go edit it to say that they are stealing it away. There are legitimate arguments to be made for leaving the decision to the patient that have nothing to do with laziness on the part of parents or doctors. Annonymous Febuary 20 12:55 PM</p>
<p>Sorry but in <i>all</i> human cultures, gender assignment and neonatal surgery <i>are</i> decisions entrusted to parents, usually with help of doctors or midwives. It is the nature of human beings and not something that needs to be symmetrically criticized. And the decision about surgery in adolescence is a difficult one to leave to a child-- whether you think so or not. Read again, this is not presented as a reason not to choose this course, only as "perhaps" a potential problem. And also contrary to your claim, I am not insulting, finger wagging, or imputing laziness to the adults who leave it to the child. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 03:03, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"It is the nature of human beings and not something that needs to be symmetrically criticized."</p>
<p>Why? Because you say so? And since when is so-called "human nature" above criticism? And who said anything about gender assignment? In any event thats not what we're talking about here.</p>
<p>"And the decision about surgery in adolescence is a difficult one to leave to a child-- whether you think so or not."</p>
<p>I would appreciate it if you would please actually read my posts before responding to them, thank you.</p>
<p>"And also contrary to your claim, I am not insulting, finger wagging, or imputing laziness to the adults who leave it to the child."</p>
<p>The article refers to leavin the descision to the child as "unfair" and accuses the parents and doctors of "dodging" it as "too difficult". That is insulting and finger wagging. The possibility that they might see the desision as simply not their's to make is not even mentioned.</p>
<p>Annonymous 10:38 February 21 2006</p>
<p>I will respond to what you write if you do me the same courtesy. The strongest argument that can be made for deferring the decision about surgery is not that we should allow all children to choose whether to have congenital birth defects repaired, nor that we should explicitly encourage all children in early adolescence to confirm their comfort with their sex of assignment and raising. The strongest argument is that as we have better understood the frequency of adult problems after traditional management, optimal management has become less clear, a more difficult decision, and perhaps if we share ownership of this difficult decision with the person most affected, a smaller number of adults will feel they were mismanaged. Some of us who deal with children of that age do not feel that it will be any easier a decision for them than for parents and doctors, and the sentence with its <i>perhaps</i> simply acknowledges that. And <i>perhaps</i> I may be wrong. Note it is not presented as a compelling argument against that course, just as a potential cost or problem. If you can't even understand this concern it reflects badly on your empathy or experience with early adolescents. If you want to censor even this mild reservation it suggests you have the kind of hubristic certainty about these conditions that made it so hard for some people to see or admit the problems with traditional management. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 02:38, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>"Unfairness" is not just a different way of saying difficulty. Accusing someone of "dodging" a descision because it is "too difficult" is not just a different way of saying they "shared ownership of a difficult decision with the person most affected". If you mean that the descision is difficult, stressful, whatever, then put that. If you feel that it perhaps might be unfair, then put that, but as written it treats unfairness as a given outcome that surgery can perhaps avoid.</p>
<p>And please stop trying to tell me what I think.</p>

<p>"Little or no pubic hair or other androgenic hair appears, though no teenage girl ever complains of this to her doctor." What, <b>never</b>? --<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedfoxtail_e0ac.html" title="User:Redfoxtail">redfox</a> 15:47, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The statement is not hyperbolic though if you want to be pedantic I am sure somewhere someone has complained about it, but I have certainly never had a girl with delayed puberty express distress over lack of pubic hair, or an American doctor mention attempting to induce it to grow, nor is doing so mentioned in any of the American or European medical texts on therapy of delayed puberty or hypopituitarism or androgen insensitivity. I do remember an article published by some Greek doctors in one of the European pediatric journals perhaps 20 years ago desccribing a way to induce more pubic hair in girls with hypopituitarism (who often have sparse hair) with testosterone cream, but I have never ever heard an American girl complain about it. So go ahead and change it to "it is nearly unheard of for a teenage girl to complain of this to her doctor" if you would like to cover the remote possibility that someone somewhere might have done so. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 23:14, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I was once the national leader of the Androgen Insensitivity Support Group. Alterprise, I appreciate the hard work you have done to make this article sensitive and accurate. However, I feel I must add that, as a women with Complete AIS, who has met at least 100 other women with AIS, many of us, especially those of us now in middle age, were deeply distressed over the lack of pubic hair. We were terrified of locker rooms and being "found out." It was and is our "stigmata." And I am also afraid that, at least for me, the tone of the comments about no one ever talking to her doctor about lack of pubic hair, seem flip to me and carry a sting.</p>
<p>In the privacy of the support group, and amongst ourselves, we talk about having felt freakish, and of being terrified what boyfriends and later, hopefully, lovers would think about our lack of pubic hair. In my case, I have AIS Grade 7 on the Quigley scale, which means I have absolutely no pubic hair and no axillary (underarm hair). It is clear when you are intimate with a woman with Complete AIS (CAIS) that this is not someone who is carefully shaving or waxing away pubic hair. Just in the same way that you could tell if a man had no facial hair and no need to shave, you can tell that a woman with AIS simply does not have pubic hair. For many of us, it triggered conversations with lovers that we were simply unable (because we had been lied to and didn't know our diagnosis) to have. I personally feared that anyone I might fall in love with would assume that I was kinky beyond all measure. Remember, I came of age in the 1970s when almost no one in America was removing pubic hair. In fact, in my early 30s, before I came to know of my diagnosis, I tricked my OB-GYN into prescribing Estratest (estrogen and testosterone) for what I untruthfully said was a libido problem. I was trying to grow pubic hair.</p>
<p>You state that no one discusses this with her physician. I submit that, at least for those of us who are now of middle age, it was so shameful that it was something that could not be spoken. There were many of us who were so scared by the shame and fear of having "something" that no one would talk to us about, that we never mentioned anything to anyone--not our parents, not our doctors, not our girfriends and certainly not the man in our life. I was a psychologically healthy 16 year old until I went through being made the center of a medical circus. I then fell into a series of debilitating depression, self-injury and suicide attempts. It has been the hardest struggle of my life to recover from this diagnosis and the cone of secrecy that fell around me. We didn't talk about pubic hair because we didn't talk about anything and no one talked to us--not even our parents and our doctors--the people who were supposed to be caring for us. I compare what happened to us to the equivalent of being medically raped and then forced to be silent about it. That may sound harsh and it may be hard to believe that I am no longer harboring great amounts of anger, but I simply can find no other words to express how I feel about the silence that was imposed on me. I know that everyone around me was trying to do what they felt to be the best for me, but they were simply wrong in their assumption that if I didn't know my diagnosis, I would just stop wondering about it and "get on" with my life. In fact, the silence had the opposite effect.</p>
<p>As an example of what we didn't talk about: I went through almost two years of unsuccessful attempts to have intercourse which was impossible due to severe, in my case, vaginal hypoplasia. I never had the courage to tell anyone and the difficulty eventually destroyed the relationship between me and my boyfriend. (I have gone on to a successful sex life, marriage and motherhood through adoption. I have a good life and feel fully "over" AIS.)</p>
<p>I am no longer active in the support group, I feel like my issues around AIS are resolved. I will probably return again when my young nieces who have AIS are working through their own emotions and need support. While active in the group, I made it a point to work with the young teenage girls who were just learning of their diagnosis. It seems to me that the lack of pubic hair may be less of a problem for these younger women than it was for us. After all, it is now fashionable to be hairless.</p>
<p>I propose that no one, not our parents, not even the most caring of physicians, has any idea of the torment that is going on in the mind of a newly-diagnosed woman with AIS. That truth only comes out in support group meetings when it is only us AIS gals and in completley trustworthy relationships with a truly skilled therapist.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, I have never heard one of us complain of lack of axillary hair, but it doesn't carry the same emotional context of sexual maturity that breast development, menstruation and pubic hair have.</p>
<p>If I hadn't heard the same stories over and over again from so many women with AIS, I would say that this is all POV, but there must be some veracity and authenticity granted to those of us who have lived the diagnosis.</p>
<p>Respectfully, Espanglish (I would normally use my real name as it is already all over the Internet connected with AIS, but now I have young nieces with AIS who don't need to have their privacy violated by my posting my name in connection with this sensitive and difficult issue.)</p>
<p>Thank you for educating us. I am removing the sentence, which you accurately described as flip. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 12:10, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamie_Lee_Curtis_190e.html" title="Jamie Lee Curtis">Jamie Lee Curtis</a>, the American actress, is androgen insensitive. Some also suspect that <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joan_of_Arc_9b78.html" title="Joan of Arc">Joan of Arc</a> had this syndrome.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Since Jamie Lee Curtis and her father have at least three times, that I know of, denied that Jamie has this condition, we should really add some sort of proof other than rumors. I'm afraid that leaving this statement is not only potentially libelous, but aslo very inconsiderate. Also there is so much conjecture surrounding Joan of Arc, it really doesn't add anything to the understanding of the condition to put this in without proof.</dd>

<dd>I'll have to find the dates, but I know that on The Veiw and a news interview, she denied it, and her father denied it during a call-in show. Can we please make sure BEFORE we write these things? I just want to be fair to these people.

You were only trying to add new info to the 'Pedia, and if we knew for sure, I think it would be VERY important to show an example of such a person.

<p>I would like to begin to work on a section about AIS and osteoporosis. While the issue is certainly not settled, research by Robert Marcus, Charmina Quigley, and quit a few other researcbers are clearly pointing the way toward the belief that reduced bone density is a feature of AIS, not just a result of AIS women defaulting on their HRT. I have multiple sources to support this.</p>
<p>Although there are far fewer studies about AIS and psychological outcome, there are a couple of very interesting studies out of England and in cooperation with both the UK and US AIS support groups that talk of the psychological difficulties experienced by women with AIS.</p>
<p>There is also some interesting work coming out of Harvard and the Boston Eye and Ear Institute about AIs and meibomian gland (eye) disfunction, but since the consequenes of this medical minor inconvenience, I don't think it is worth the effort of developing a section on this.</p>
<p>If I can support these sections with sources, is anyone going to blow a gasket? As a professional writer, and a woman with AIS, I can certainly take criticism and I know that I may not be the most unbiased of writers on this subject, but I will take great care to be as objective as I can be and I will depend on the community to point out where I fall from this standard. OK?</p>
<p>Espanglish</p>
<p>By all means add something about both topics. Would 2-5 sentences on each topic be proportional to the other specific problems discussed in the article? Can you give us a couple of specific references for each? <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 02:46, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I find the information you present to be accurate but you fail to explore:</p>
<p>1.) novel and investigational therapeutics for MAIS, including but not limited to, high-dose androgen therapy in effort to increase the level of testosterone to twice the upper limit of normal to overcome resistance at the cellular level in cases of only minimal signalling problems.</p>
<p>I was surprised you did not talk about receptor negative AR-gene defects which are the most deleterious because in these cases, no AR receptors are present, resulting in CAIS. Receptor positive problems indicate receptors are present, but there are binding problems. Within the realm of receptor positive binding problems, there can be difficulties with androgen binding, or difficulties with DNA binding.6 The AR can exhibit reduced affinity for ligands, normal affinity with reduced capacity, or thermolability problems (reduced binding capacity at temperatures above 37 degrees), enhanced ligand dissociation, or modified ligand specificity, the causes of which can include frameshift mutations, deletions, missense and nonsense mutations, expansion of a CAG repeat, and mutations that interfere with splicing.6 For instance, one partial resistance mutation causes a replacement of a glutamine with a lysine residue.1 In partial resistance, defects may stem from point mutations in the steroid-binding domains or DNA-binding domain.</p>
<p>2.) the persistence to essentially categorize MAIS with CAIS by association in many parts of this article. MAIS deserves its own article, and many urologists would strongly disagree with the notion that MAIS (which is routinely seen as "infertile" cases) is the same as woman with CAIS. For a new reading public, there need to be more clear boundaries to indicate these are very different disorders that only share a slightly similar origin, yet as was seen from what I just wrote, the molecular biology of AIS is not simply about androgen resistance...it's highly nuanced and complex. user:Freethyroxine83</p>
<p>General reply. Thanks for the comments. 1. Comments about a specific article content are best put on the talk page of the article where all editors interested in the article can see them. For most articles there is no single author, but for many (including this), a single author did most of the work and may be quickest to respond to suggested changes. 2. Please sign comments on talk pages. I added your signature above-- you can do so more easily by typing four tildes and it will automatically convert that into your signature with a time/date stamp. 3. For the articles that are relatively comprehensive and polished, suggest significant content changes on the talk pages first, especially if it is a fact change from the text. If you make lots of changes in many parts of the text, it becomes harder for another editor to accept some and negotiate others and you may find the whole set of changes reverted pending discussion.</p>
<p>Specific replies about MAIS. 1. I have no disagreement with the specific content suggestions above. When I rewrote this article it was a multiply flawed article about testicular feminization (which you can see in the archive), and I tried to make the spectrum of forms of AIS clear to the reader. Most of the readers of this article have been interested only in the more severe forms, which are covered more comprehensively. If you think that MAIS is insufficiently emphasized, it is a matter of opinion, but suggest some specific changes-- as you probably noticed, I disagreed with the phrasing of a couple of the first comments you offered. 2. Your elaborations about the spectrum of AR abnormalities can certainly be put in the appropriate pathophysiology section. Bear in mind the article is already a large one and some of the medical articles have been criticized as too detailed or less accessible to a general reader. 3. I am not sure about the relative frequencies. At least two of my sources, several years old, suggested that the more severe forms were more common than MAIS, but clearly they are far more likely to be recognized. Can you cite a more recent population survey showing a frequency for MAIS that is not simply a non-pathologic polymorphism frequency (which is what I assume is the challenge to the compiling of such data)? 4. You can certainly write a new article on mild androgen insensitivity syndrome. All you have to do is click on the red link and type away.</p>
<p>A final general note. The medical and biological articles of wikipedia are very uneven. Contributing editors with expertise are welcome. However, editors willing to write new material or fix the worst articles are far more needed than those who simply feel the need to "tweak" the best articles. Please contribute. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 11:12, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Of the recent anonymous changes, some are justifiable ,and some not. Please make an account and discuss. To begin with, what aspect of the definition of birth defect is not completely met by intermediate AIS? <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 23:17, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
"Birth defect" is a highly value laden label. Many intersexed persons resent being labelled as defective simply because their anatomy does not correspond to traditional definitions of sexual "normalcy". It is suggested that these labels speak more to social-cultural prejudices than to medical realities. Insofar as the "defective" nature of physical sexual variation has now come into question, it is time that we take up a more neutral and open language, as the debate continues. Thus I propose that <b>"anatomical variation"</b> is more appropriate than <b>"birth defect".</b> One can still argue as to whether the "variation" is harmful or not. 72.1.195.4 22:22, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>And by all your arguments you would call a cleft lip or absence of the ovaries examples of "anatomic variation"? A birth defect is a birth defect, neither more nor less. The term is immediately understandable and perfectly appropriate. "Anatomic variation is euphemistic obfuscation". More importantly I emphatically reject the idea that to acknowledge that an unwanted difference present at birth <i>is</i> an unwanted difference present at birth is to devalue or insult the person who has it. Repeat until you understand: People are not diseases and defects. Repeat until you understand: Having diseases and defects is an inevitable part of being a human being; calling it something different doesn't make it not a problem.

<p>While there are few references in the media about AIS, I recall an episode of House where a patient had AIS. Also, the debunked idea of Jamie Lee Curtis having it could also be mentioned. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../e/e/d/User%7EEedo_Bee_d006.html" title="User:Eedo Bee">Eedo Bee</a> (<a href="../../../e/e/d/User_talk%7EEedo_Bee_03ed.html" title="User talk:Eedo Bee">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Eedo_Bee_577a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Eedo Bee">contribs</a>) 14:54, 18 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>I do not think it worth mentioning that a television episode featured a garbled 10- second description of a disease; sorry if you disagree. The celebrity rumor is a more important issue specifically related to AIS. The celebrity rumor factor is dealt with in the article, but I think we need to refrain from specific names unless there has been public confirmation. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 18:41, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
