<p>I'm no fan of Andrew Cuomo, but this article definitely appears to include a ton of bias.</p>
<p>This main articles mention of Cuomo's time with HUD appears to be misleading.</p>
<p>Lucy Komisar’s article:</p>
<pre>
  "Fees for Our Friends: the Scandal that Taints Andre ..." 
  (The Komisar Scoop, August 22, 2006;
   <a href="http://thekomisarscoop.com/2006/08/22/fees-for-our-friends-the-scandal-that-taints-andrew-cuomo/" class="external free" title="http://thekomisarscoop.com/2006/08/22/fees-for-our-friends-the-scandal-that-taints-andrew-cuomo/" rel="nofollow">http://thekomisarscoop.com/2006/08/22/fees-for-our-friends-the-scandal-that-taints-andrew-cuomo/</a> )
</pre>
<p>is a very interesting contrast to that taken by the writer of the original bio.</p>
<hr />
<p>Komisar is an investigative reporter with 40 years experience, with articles published in the NYTimes, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times and many more newspapers and magazines. The person who wrote the above critique should specify which items are misleading. Broadsided attacks are not appropriate. So give at least one example of something that's misleading.</p>

<hr />
<p>This stuff below is uncited and controversial. It doesn't belong in a wikipedia article---&gt;&gt; gubernatorial humiliation. Worried about further political damage, he authorized an accusatory public statement about his wife at a time that demanded discretion for the sake of the couple's three children and their relationship with their mother. Career and image trumped family.</p>
<p>"As we wrote then, Cuomo "looks desperate to protect his public image and political career." Such a skewing of values leads to the question of whether, based on character, Cuomo should be entrusted with the responsibility of applying the law evenhandedly to friend and adversary, without calculation as to political benefit. That we feel compelled to ask is answer in itself."</p>

<li>I didn't address this article prior to the election because it was too close to the vote. However, I think this article is highly sanitized. The material referenced above is not limited to one or two sources, but has been published in a number of reliable sources. The definition of a reliable source can, itself, turn into an exercise in POV. Granted, these journalists often have a POV. That is to be expected. Their POV should not prevent a neutralized version of their information being placed in this encyclopedia. I am considering some way to address these issues without a lot of hyperbole or invective, but the article is very one-sided the way it stands now. If someone can get to it before I do, please do.<a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClaimman75_fcb3.html" title="User:Claimman75">claimman75</a> 23:42, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>First you complain that information is not sourced. Then you complain that one should not quote and link to news articles. So which is it? You are getting caught up in your contradictions.</p>
<p>Are you suggesting that other Wikipedia entries are based on original research rather than newspaper articles and other written sources? Where does the information come from?</p>
<p>The Daily News editorial was interesting. I hadn't seen it. So why didn't you post it? Sure gives one a more substantive view of Cuomo than his resume.</p>

<dd>Cuomo has been praised by many leaders in the Democratic Party. Bill Clinton said that Cuomo "led one of the most dramatic and successful reforms of a federal agency in modern U.S. history, with HUD going from the brink of elimination to the forefront of the struggle for justice in America." Despite this, many people think differently of Andrew Cuomo. An article by Lucy Komisar claims that while at HUD, Cuomo got rid of a system which was designed to award contracts on the merits in order to be able to give contracts to his political friends. The New York Times and New York Daily News editorial boards say that he is more interested in his political career than the greater good. The New York Times editorial board gave as an example a $685,000 book paid for by taxpayers to highlight his accomplishments, while the Daily News editorial board says that he put his political career before his wife and children during his divorce. A Village Voice article by Wayne Barrett claims that Cuomo, while at HUD, encouraged a favorable settlement for a company, and later received millions of dollars from one of heads of the company. These are a few examples among other claims about him.</dd>

<li>I added a "Controversy" section to the article to indicate some of the criticisms of Mr. Cuomo. I excluded some issues to avoid making this section ponderous and disproportionately large. The Komisar reference was left out because I do think it is from a blog and I doubt it has editorial oversight. The citation to Catherine Fitts' article in "From the Wilderness", basically, covers the same information and "From the Wilderness" does have editorial oversight and an excellent fact-checking record. I think this strikes a balance between a campaign poster entry and a POV rant.<a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClaimman75_fcb3.html" title="User:Claimman75">claimman75</a> 00:59, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>There are many discernable facts and leads contained this article to constitute many NPOV. But because it happened to Ms. Fitts she definitely has a POV.</p>
