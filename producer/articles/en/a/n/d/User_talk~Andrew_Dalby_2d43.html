<dd>Welcome! thanks for your edits on Trobairitz. For the ones that have short passages in the main <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trobairitz.html" title="Trobairitz">Trobairitz</a> page, they used to have separate pages, which I then turned to redirects. I did this because I was worried there wasn't enough information to put a separate page for each of them. The point is, if you want to create larger articles for them, it might be easier for you to go into the history and revert to the longer version and modify that. Happy editing! <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 19:00, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>On spellings of names, I agree with you that Provençal/Occitan names are much better than Frenchified ones. If I were you, I would standardize on Provençal forms wherever possible.</i> Will do, I hope people won't have a cow about it.

<dl>
<dd>Whatever names are used primarily and for titling, it is important to have the various other versions (Gallicisations) somewhere in the article for searchability and comprehensiveness. Secondly, having noticed the various new Troubadour articles cropping up here and there, is there a category "Troubadours" yet? <a href="../../../s/r/n/User%7ESrnec_6158.html" title="User:Srnec">Srnec</a> 01:55, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Other versions of names: yes, I agree, and will try always to keep it in mind! Searchability is very important. Of course, if you are aware of an alternative name that isn't currently mentioned, I'm sure you'll add it.</dd>
<dd>Categories: I introduced the category 'Occitan poets', which seemed to me to fit better with the general structure. Until somebody writes about some more recent Occitan poets, this overlaps almost totally with 'Troubadours' (though 'Troubadours' is gender-specific), because there are scarcely any named medieval Occitan poets in other genres. In addition, there are the manually maintained lists at <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troubadour.html" title="Troubadour">Troubadour</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trobairitz.html" title="Trobairitz">Trobairitz</a> and (for their northern French colleagues) <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trouv%C3%A8re.html" title="Trouvère">Trouvère</a>. But if you wanted to add a 'Troubadour' and 'Trobairitz' category, I certainly wouldn't object! <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Dalby_694d.html" title="User:Andrew Dalby">Andrew Dalby</a> 13:10, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>After a lenghty, but much-needed Wikibreak, I'm happy to announce that version 1.2 of VandalProof is now <i>available for download!</i> Beyond fixing some of the most obnoxious bugs, like the persistent crash on start-up that many have experienced, version 1.2 also offers a wide variety of new features, including a stub-sorter, a global user whitelist and blacklist, navigational controls, and greater customization. You can find a full list of the new features <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVandalProof_b972.html#Suggestions_Being_Considered" title="WP:VandalProof">here</a>. While I believe this release to be a significant improvement over the last, it's nonetheless nowhere near the end of the line for VandalProof. Thanks to <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobchurch_62ba.html" title="User:Robchurch">Rob Church</a>, I now have an account on <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://test.wikipedia.org" class="external text" title="http://test.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">test.wikipedia.org</a></span> with SysOp rights and have already been hard at work incorporating administrative tools into VandalProof, which I plan to make available in the near future. An example of one such SysOp tool that I'm working on incorporating is my <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_SHM_0af5.html" title="User:AmiDaniel/SHM">simple history merge</a> tool, which simplifies the process of performing history merges from one article into another. Anyway, if you haven't already, I'd encourage you to <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVandalProof_b972.html#Download" title="WP:VandalProof">download and install version 1.2</a> and take it out for a test-drive. As always, your <a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_VP_suggestions_a7f1.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel/VP/suggestions">suggestions</a> for improvement are always appreciated, and I hope that you will find this new version useful.

<p>The only details I can now provide on Christian's trip to Greece is that he went in 1170 as a representative of the Holy Roman Emperor to Manuel Comnenus. I assume it took him to Constantinople. The original reference in the article to his trip to Greece was a direct translation from the German Wiki's article. I do not know how this embassy from Barbarossa was related to the archbishop's attempts to end the papal schism (or <i>if</i> it was, the German may have been in error).

<p>Hi. I accidentally created a new page for Manuel under his more accurate name Manuel Komnenos Doukas without noticing that you had already created one for Manuel Ducas (the one option that I did not check). I think the informaition in the new article covers everything in the old and goes beyond it.

<dd>It's the only way I know how to do them. The text of the note appears embedded in the relevant paragraph, surrounded by ref ... /ref. At the foot of the article you type the single full word, references / (each of these surrounded by angle brackets). Open an edit page for the whole article and you'll see. Does that answer the question?</dd>
<dd>True, Nicetas has good information including the description of Conrad already quoted in the text. He should be added to the note, I agree. But Roger seems well informed on the Montferrats and includes the detail that Christian was left in Boniface's care. He also lists the three places where Christian was successively held, but since I can't interpret these names I did not include them. Can you? 1.

<p>Why does the English Wiki treat "Villehardouin" as a surname in and of itself? Shouldn't it be "of Villehardouin" or "de Villehardouin"? <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoffrey_of_Villehardouin_e3bc.html" title="Geoffrey of Villehardouin">Geoffrey of Villehardouin</a> has the "of," but his relatives do not. The French Wiki uses "de."

<dd>Actually, Srnec, I don't understand it either. I was merely following what others had done before in the case of this particular family. If there is in fact no reason for doing it this way, it would probably be better to change the practice now than to let it spread any further! <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Dalby_694d.html" title="User:Andrew Dalby">Andrew Dalby</a> 07:04, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I have not adjusted the other Villehardouin names, e.g. <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_II_Villehardouin_82aa.html" title="William II Villehardouin">William II Villehardouin</a>, though they ought to be changed really. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Dalby_694d.html" title="User:Andrew Dalby">Andrew Dalby</a> 17:17, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Andrew. I wrote some time ago an article about food in Ancient Greece (<a href="../../../../fr/a/l/i/Alimentation_en_Gr%C3%A8ce_antique_ced5.html" class="extiw" title="fr:Alimentation_en_Grèce_antique">fr:Alimentation en Grèce antique</a>), which has achieved FA status and was translated here as <a href="../../../d/i/e/Diet_of_Ancient_Greece_a4dd.html" title="Diet of Ancient Greece">Diet of Ancient Greece</a>.

<dd>Oh, I still agree with everything I said in Siren Feasts (at least, 99% of it)! I just haven't had cause to quote it as yet in editing Wikipedia.

I often see myself as a food historian, but by no means always.

As for the name Kharja or Jarcha, it is an interesting question. When Emilio García Gómez discovered the jarchas together with an Egiptian collegue, they debated that point because they were "inventing" the term. Gómez though that the transcription of the original arab characters should have the most similar sound to the original, and choosed in Spanish "Jarcha", because in Spanish J is a strong sound equivalent to arab. I think that "Kharja" is not the English pronunciation for the arab sound, but the International arab transcription of such sounds. I just don´t know how does the group "Kh" sound in English. The arab sound <a href="../../../%E1%B8%AB/%C4%81/%CA%BC/%E1%B8%AA%C4%81%CA%BC.html" title="Ḫāʼ">Ḫāʼ</a>( ﺥ ) is like a very strong English "H". Anyway, it seems that Kharja is widely used.

<p>I would agree with the moratorium as long as it returned to the status quo ante whilst this was considered and a decision made later on. As it is this seems a bit contrived since there was no consensus for the initial page moves and yet they took place. As I see it leaving the page moves as they are, albeit for a 9 month moratorium, confirms that decision. IMHO the 9 month moratorium should be used by those in favour of the ODB to prepare their case, as it where, since the onus should be on them to prove that the Komnenos spellings, etc have supplanted the Comnenus ones in general English usage. As far as I can see no-one has established that by any means and yet the pages remain on spellings which do not therefore conform to Wiki policy with regards to using the most popular terms in English. <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoydosan_77f2.html" title="User:Roydosan">Roydosan</a> 14:35, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi! I came across your articles about <a href="../../../i/v/a/Ivanko%2C_leader_of_the_Vlachs_and_Bulgarians_aac2.html" title="Ivanko, leader of the Vlachs and Bulgarians">Ivanko</a> and <a href="../../../d/o/b/Dobromir%2C_leader_of_the_Vlachs_and_Bulgarians_9e57.html" title="Dobromir, leader of the Vlachs and Bulgarians">Dobromir</a>, two of the less known medieval Bulgarian rulers. What puzzles me is the terminology you've used to refer to them: 'leader of the Vlachs and Bulgarians'... the other articles about rulers of the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Bulgarian_Empire_42d5.html" title="Second Bulgarian Empire">Second Bulgarian Empire</a> (including the earliest) use 'of Bulgaria', which is the established way to refer to them given the name of the realm they ruled over and the specific meaning of the word <i>Vlach</i> then (see <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kaloyan_of_Bulgaria_b6f2.html#Disputed_origins" title="Kaloyan of Bulgaria">Kaloyan of Bulgaria#Disputed origins</a>.

<dl>
<dd>Thanks for your message, Todor. I'm well aware of the political nature of this question: myself, I'm not very political! A novice Wikipedian at the time, I chose these headings (a) because I didn't feel sure that these two fellows were ever monarchs; (b) because the only primary source I knew for them, Niketas Choniates, describes them consistently as Vlachs. I added 'Bulgarians' on my own authority, because we are talking about Bulgaria, I felt it probable that Bulgarians were among their followers, I doubt whether Niketas always bothered to differentiate the two, and I am aware of arguments that Greek writers of this period may have avoided mentioning Bulgarians if they could find an alternative word. However, having looked again at <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kaloyan_of_Bulgaria_b6f2.html#Disputed_origins" title="Kaloyan of Bulgaria">Kaloyan of Bulgaria#Disputed origins</a>, I don't quite see what you mean by "the specific meaning of the word <i>Vlach</i> then". Specificity seems far to seek! Anyway, looking at the matter again now:</dd>
<dd>In the case of <a href="../../../d/o/b/Dobromir%2C_leader_of_the_Vlachs_and_Bulgarians_9e57.html" title="Dobromir, leader of the Vlachs and Bulgarians">Dobromir</a>, I don't see anything in Niketas to connect him with the Second Bulgarian Empire at all. Perhaps there is some other source I don't know? If there isn't, perhaps "leader of the Vlachs" alone is better since that is the term for which there is evidence?</dd>
<dd>In the case of <a href="../../../i/v/a/Ivanko%2C_leader_of_the_Vlachs_and_Bulgarians_aac2.html" title="Ivanko, leader of the Vlachs and Bulgarians">Ivanko</a>, yes, he killed <a href="../../../i/v/a/Ivan_Asen_I_06c5.html" title="Ivan Asen I">Ivan Asen I</a> so he's in the politics of the Empire. Yes, "Ivanko of Bulgaria" would do for him, wouldn't it, since the article can make clear that his known links (such as they are) are said in the original source to be Vlach.</dd>
<dd>Don't know if that helps. Looking forward to your reply <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Dalby_694d.html" title="User:Andrew Dalby">Andrew Dalby</a> 20:47, 19 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Ivanko is fine, but do we have to describe Dobromir that way in the title? The article name <a href="../../../d/o/b/Dobromir.html" title="Dobromir">Dobromir</a> is free, so we could have the article there, or otherwise disambiguate him as 'Dobromir (medieval leader)', etc., since ethnicity in the Middle Ages (and relying on Byzantine (i.e. foreign) chronologists, who would refer to numerous nationalities as 'Scythians' or 'barbarians' without regard to their origin) is a bit of a problem, and the term 'Vlach' further complicates things (it's true, it's nowhere near specific, don't know what I meant by this, probably that it may have had a different meaning compared to today). Of course, the current way you've chosen to name the article is absolutely OK.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, I'm not a specialist in the field, but I hope we could come up with some good solution. A user that might be able to help is <a href="../../../i/m/l/User%7EImladjov_b982.html" title="User:Imladjov">Ian Mladjov</a>, so I'd suggest that we discuss this with him too. <i><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Todor</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodorBozhinov_c2c4.html" title="User talk:TodorBozhinov">→</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Bozhinov</a></i> 21:18, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

It is always great to meet somebody interested in Cato. --<a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPichote_e310.html" title="User:Pichote">Pichote</a> 19:42, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your message, Pichote. No, I don't want to revert it. It's good material, though the 19th century English took me aback at first! I'm sure Cato would have approved of some good old-fashioned language, especially in his praise. Getting it all in there, with the references too, was an excellent step. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Dalby_694d.html" title="User:Andrew Dalby">Andrew Dalby</a> 19:51, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was checking this very point last night. The chapter does include a fourth item, <i>canarim</i>, and I wondered if it was a name for capsicum, but it isn't. It's some local item -- a bark I think -- on which I need to check further. So far as I can see, and disappointingly, Garcia doesn't mention capsicum at all.

<dd>That's interesting in a dog-that-didn't-bark kind of way.

<dd>Iman (if you are Iman?), if anything I did was wrong, you can correct it yourself. You don't need me to do it for you! Isn't the Herodoteans a student society? It was when I was a member. Isn't it true about the Four Went Ways? I must admit I haven't read the book (too expensive now!), I rely only on newspaper reports at the time when it was published. Sorry if I was wrong there: I'm sure you know best. Where does the book say that Troy was? It's an interesting detail and it wasn't in the article.

</dl>
<p>No I'm not Iman and I don't have any other purpose or reason for editing articles other than contributing to the global effort to find out about our history. I'm shure that the book is not too expensive for you and there must be a library near you but I am really not interested in having this conversation with you as I'm shure you're never going to read the book. I know other people like you; You read a newspaper article about some theory being (as you call it) "crackpot" and immediately you loose interest, afraid of openly showing any curiosity about the theory, scared of not being taken seriously any more by your friends and colleages. Now will you please remove the line? Regards <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntiphus_dd1f.html" title="User:Antiphus">Antiphus</a> 19:33, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Hallo Andrew I edited the line that you put in the article myself because somehow I don't think that you're going to. Was I right about the crackpot- thing I wrote or are you really interested? If so I apologize for my reaction. The location Wilkens gives is the Gog Magog Downs. This theory is not about moving entire countries as sometimes seems to have been claimed watching the unbelief but about migration of the orally transmitted poems and locations being re-named in the Mediterranean; that's not impossible, is it?

<dd>That's good, Antiphus. I was only a few miles from the truth, wasn't I? I've never in my life called anyone a crackpot, and all your guesses about me happen to be wrong (even the library)!

<p>hello. thanks for straightening out my clumsy addition of jane of aza to the dominic page. i will find out the earlist mention of jane of aza soon and pass that info along to you. i have access to the library of a convent of dominican sisters, so if anyone would know, it would be them. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongkyongnae_e837.html" title="User:Hongkyongnae">Hongkyongnae</a> 14:59, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>hello again, some quick research turned this up about jane of aza. A castilian preacher named rodrigo de cerrato who had visisted caleruega shortly after 1280 described saint cominic's father as "honorable and rich among the people ofhis village." he goes on to discuss saint dominic's relatives, including jane of aza. my source for this is "Saint Dominic and his Times" by M. H. Vicaire, O.P., translated by Kathleen Pond. McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1964, p. 403. I hope that is of some help. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongkyongnae_e837.html" title="User:Hongkyongnae">Hongkyongnae</a> 02:02, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>agree with you. We should think about the levels.

<p>I never proposed the whole category system for deletion, just a merging of the redundant ones if you read carefully. Tobais has taken great offence to this obviously, but having 3 cats for templates that say the same things is silly and redundant. Needless to say, since you suggested merging the templates, it is logical that you would want the categories they create to be merged. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 18:03, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Tobias, my apologies for not replying on this before. My impression is that you had very bad luck. I have had it happen to me too, to have an article deleted as I was just about to add something useful to it. The trouble is, the rules say that this may happen. And we know there is a work-round (develop the article on a personal page, then move it into place when it's good enough). It's just that sometimes we go ahead and hope for the best ...</dd>

<dd>The rules do NOT allow this. WP:CSD A1 explicitly states if there is enough conTEXT the article is not a speedy candidate. But admins repeatedly ignore this and if I ask them to undo their admin right abuses they don't. I am really annoyed that this class of admins can do this. And then I got blocked for moving a talk that I started at User_talk:Chairboy, he replied there and additionally copied the answer to my talk. I replied at both places, but then moved the talk from my page because I thought it is best to have it in the corresponding article talk. Because there it is easier for other users to get involved and also this is to seperate this talk from other talk on my page.

<dd>Yes, reading through WP:CSD, the matter could have been handled differently. But at the time in question, I think honestly the article did meet the criteria for speedy deletion. That's why I personally think your experience was "very bad luck".

<p>Re: your note on my talk page.</p>
<p>I would expect that either the indexing is on the first word in the name, which is "De", or the first <i>meaningful</i> word, which in this case is <i>écluse</i>. (The name "De l'écluse" means "Of the Lock", lock as in canal lock.)</p>

<p>See <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategorization_of_people_2346.html#Ordering_names_in_a_category" title="Wikipedia:Categorization of people">Wikipedia style guide page</a> for this English Wikipedia, quote:</p>
<p style="border:1px dotted #8080C0;padding-left:.5ex;padding-right:.5ex;font-family:Times New Roman,serif;background-color:#f8f8ff;">People with multiple-word last names: sorting is done on the entire <i>last name</i> as usually used in English, in normal order and not (for example) according to the Dutch system that puts some words like "van", "vanden", etc... after the rest of the last name. Example: <s>[[Categorie:Nederlands voetballer|Basten van Marco]]</s>; <s>[[Category:A.C. Milan players|Basten, Marco van]]</s> → [[Category:A.C. Milan players|Van Basten, Marco]]</p>
It can hardly be more clearly stated. Notice that the Dutch ordering style is given only <i>for example</i>, for French names one should sort on the <i>entire</i> last name just as well.</dd>
<dd>I had a lengthy discussion on this topic (for Dutch ordering) two weeks ago, if you are interested on how one may tackle sorting normal/capitalized characters and special characters that do not occur in the alphabet (as in French mainly the apostrophe "&#160;´&#160;" in surnames and the dash "&#160;-&#160;" in firstnames), see <a href="../../../f/o/s/Template_talk%7EFOSS_celeb_0948.html" title="Template talk:FOSS celeb">Template talk:FOSS celeb</a> (sections 'Alphabet sort' till 'Analphabetism' included – in particular section <a href="../../../f/o/s/Template_talk%7EFOSS_celeb_0948.html#Alphabet_sort_2" title="Template talk:FOSS celeb">Alphabet sort 2</a> from "One more practical note:" onwards); noteworthy especially for French: best also replace every accented character by its capitalized unaccented letter before <i>sorting</i> (but then <i>show</i> the names properly with small accented letters, of course). — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../s/e/p/Sep_3.html" title="Sep 3">3 Sep</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> 10:08-10:53&#160;(UTC)</span></dd>

<dd>Thank you both for your interesting comments. It's a very complicated issue and I shall be happy to let others worry about it -- I'm certainly not going to revert what Luc has done -- but it remains a fact, in most Wikipedia category lists containing French names with de, that the name is alphabetised under the following word, not under the de. In other words, the de is not treated as part of the surname. There are a lot of examples. And the same holds good for nearly every other English reference source containing French names. This is why you find Balzac under B, not under D. I learned this as a library cataloguer, and it remains true.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However -- this is why I draw back from the abyss -- when French names are carried into other languages (e.g. because the family has migrated), the De is thereafter often treated as the beginning of the surname, by the people themselves and by reference sources. Well, of course, Carolus Clusius or Charles de l'Ecluse is not French but Flemish ...</dd>

<dd>I had to think just for a fraction of a second '<a href="../../../b/a/l/Balzac.html" title="Balzac">Balzac</a>, is that a <i>de Balzac?'</i> before it popped 'Of course, <i>Honoré de Balzac!'</i> – Thus I assume it's like Beethoven: the name is commonly used without a prefix, but one does not say 'Ludwig Beethoven': when the full name is used, we use the prefix. The style guide mentions this <i>exception</i> for <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beethoven.html" title="Beethoven">Beethoven</a> and for <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montesquieu.html" title="Montesquieu">Montesquieu</a>. I think on Wikipedia then, you might also order Balzac under B. (at least if in English, his name is most often shortened as such; a good rule of the thumb might be what I tried to show here: check whether a link under the shortened name ends up at the right person, if so it may not be sufficient proof, but if <i>not</i> so it is surely best to use normal style guide ordering). Logically, as a library cataloguer, you encountered more often such names or those of nobility (as a title and not really a name), than one would in name lists of lesser-known people, so it makes a lot of sense to put books and filing cards to those is the order of the most commonly used name. I do not know whether the lists you had found in this Wikipedia correspond to this kind of names; it was hard to find the style guide (Luc, you, and I had missed it even when looking for it, fortunately someone else pointed it out to me) and thus most lists in this encyclopedia will have been created without knowing about the guideline; an editor probably copied the style of other lists found (possibly with names like Balzac, Montesquieu, ...) and so on for later editors... But as you have indicated, for the English language Wikipedia we should best follow its style guide.</dd>
<dd>Thank you also for pointing out that Charles de l'Ecluse is taken to have been Flemish. I had encountered the name before, though only because before I created my username, I did something on external links for the article on probably the most famous scientist of my home city, <a href="../../../r/e/m/Rembert_Dodoens_6f42.html" title="Rembert Dodoens">Rembert Dodoens</a>. I had assumed the translator of the 1554 <i>Cruydeboeck</i> to have been French. A quick glance at the latter's article shows <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_de_l%27Ecluse_2d55.html" title="Charles de l'Ecluse">Charles de l'Ecluse</a> to have been more than just a translator, I'm going to read it more carefully now.

<p>Hi Andrew. I don't have time these days to log on much so didn't see your comment on my talk page (about the "Homeric scholarship" article) until just now. Thanks for your comments there. I've posted a couple more replies on the article's discussion page, but mostly just to re-state what I think; I'll leave it there, I think.</p>
<p>By the way, you mentioned on my talk page your aim of "humbly and fearfully, steer[ing] all who disagree back to the texts of Parry and Lord"; oddly enough, the more I study Homer, the more I find myself being steered back towards 19th and early 20th century philology, and towards contemporary figures like Kullmann and West (even if West is wrong half the time, which he is), when I'm not reading the oldies like Lachmann. Strange but true. I wonder what that says about me. (I like to think of it as a kind of progression from my discovery of Eustathius some years ago.) Ah well.

<p>Cutting the flattery to a minimum: your work has proved invaluable on several occasions, and you were the only person I could think of who might know the answer to the question I am about to pose. I was wondering...Plutarch mentions of Cato in his life (1): "On active service, he drank nothing but water, except that occasionally when he was parched with thirst he would ask for vinegar, or when his strength was exhausted add a little wine." I wonder what else there would have been on active duty. Surely an army wouldn't have taken beer, it having far too little alcohol by volume. Would they have had juice? Milk?

<dd>Thanks alot. I will share your response at class tomorrow night. I was not the only one who wondered. That's what it seemed like to me, they would take more concentrated liquids like wine and vinegar and forage for water as they marched. As a followup, what provinces would have been most likely to have beer in abundantia? I assume certainly the northern gauls/germans would have, but who else?

<dd>It is ambiguous, unfortunately where in Africa Cato fought.

I will ask, at the same aforementioned class meeting, tomorrow, if anyone knows better where exactly he fought. It is purported, again by Plutarch, that he conquered more cities in Spain than days he spent there. He would have been in Northern Africa certainly, but not as far east as Egypt.</dd>

<p>I am not put of by this at all. I just remember my prof (and my notes) stating otherweise. My prof had said O. was on Calypso's island for 10 years and then he left. Perhaps I copied it down wrong or perhaps she was wrong. I would have consulted my book, but it was at school. I was just leaving the Odyssey to you guys.

<li>What an exciting life you must lead, Andrew! Powell manages his treatment of Jean rather well, I think, allowing us to reach our own conclusions about her without hammering her conflicting characteristics home.

<dd>On your recent changes to the modern treatments: I like your treatment of Wilkens.

<p>Hey, I made some changes to the "My Name is Red" talk page, and am giving you a heads up. Not sure what the proper protocol here is?</p>
<p>A somewhat funny note--when I met Pamuk a few years ago, he had given a talk in which he made some quip along the lines of "'My Name is Red' is my first book that people say the translation is better than the original, and I don't know how I feel about that!" (Pamuk is rather funny).</p>
<p>I wasn't nearly so big a fan of Kars, but I'm far more drawn to the middle periods than recent. You might want to check out Kara Kitap / The Black Book if you're more interested in the contemporary period.</p>

<p>Two questions about Sillery and his world:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quiggin calls him "Professor Sillery" (p. 175 of <i>A Question ...</i>) but in the next line Sillery makes "a deprecatory gesture in our direction to suggest his own unworthiness of this style of address". In other words, he isn't a professor, and only someone from a different planet (that's how Quiggin is portrayed in this episode, more or less) would address him as such. Am I right there? Or is he called Professor somewhere else as well?</li>
<li>Is it Oxford, or just "the university"? When I read the books, I imagined it as Cambridge, but that's probably because I went there. Is Oxford named? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Dalby_694d.html" title="User:Andrew Dalby">Andrew Dalby</a> 13:14, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Good questions which I have put to the experts on the AP discussion list. My own assumption was that Sillery either held a minor chair or was a professor emeritus still accorded the title, like say, Prof. Jonanthan Riley-Smith at Cambridge today. From memory Spurling (in her Handbook/Invitation to the Dance) is silent on Sillery's precise status. He is said not to publish research.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It is indeed Oxford, where AP was up at, ahem, Balliol, but like Eton it is not named. Internal evidence (eg the motor accident) and AP's journals support this. Which is not to say that nothing has been drawn from Cambridge though. -- <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalliol_0e19.html" title="User:Balliol">Balliol</a> 14:18, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In response to your queries the scholars on the Powell discussion list observe that while Sillery is nowhere else described by the author as "professor", Sillers adopts an equally self-deprecating attitude when granted a peerage. However Dr Clarke from Canberra University raises two questions:
<dl>
<dd>1. Is it likely that Sillers could have got a chair on the strength of one book, even at Oxford in the 1920s?</dd>
<dd>2. How would an Oxbridge undergraduate in those days have addressed a professor at an informal gathering?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Nonetheless Spurling (who appears to have cleared her material with Powell) does list him as "Professor Sillery" in her 'Handbook/Invitation to the Dance'</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Dr Clarke adds that Quiggin's "faux pas is probably due to the much wider application of the title in the United States (Associate Professor, Adjunct Professor, Lulubelle Z. Furtwangler Professor, etc., etc.) than at Oxbridge. He naturally assumes from past experience that anybody of Sillery's position and influence would have professorial status."</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Thanks for your edits, which are adding a lot of interesting material.</dd>
<dd>One problem is spelling. The author's name, for example, is often misspelt in various ways in the article, and this looks bad. The correct spelling is Suetonius -- but you notice that you have written it differently above.</dd>
<dd>Another problem for me is that the outlines are just like a short biography of each emperor. If I want the biography, I would read the article on the Emperor concerned, or else I would read the whole text of Suetonius. I would expect a good encyclopedia article about <i>The Twelve Caesars</i> to tell me how many sources and what kind of source materials Suetonius cites, maybe listing them; how he organizes his material on each emperor; how his information compares with other major sources available to us; whether his view of each emperor seems biased, and in what direction, and why; whether there is a significant difference between the way he treats Julius Caesar and the way he treats Domitian (for example), and if there may be a reason for that.</dd>
<dd>I'm not saying one person has to do all this -- it takes a lot of people to make a good Wikipedia article -- but I think at present there is too much simple biography in the summaries, and I suspect they will get shortened again, by someone else if not by me.</dd>
<dd>Incidentally, would you think it a good idea to get a username and sign in before editing? You don't have to, but it makes it easier to work with others on improving Wikipedia. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Dalby_694d.html" title="User:Andrew Dalby">Andrew Dalby</a> 14:30, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"According to a high-ranking Burmese official, who is now based in a Western country, the military regime is impressed with some foreign journalists and their stories on Burma. The Burmese official reportedly confided to a guest, "We like Roger Mitton, Stephen Brookes and Martin Smith. Their writings are fair and well-balanced."</dd>

<dl>

<dl>
<dd>Roger Mitton, who now writes for Asiaweek magazine, is frequently criticized for writing stories that are seen to be pro-junta, and has lately been predicting a historic political agreement between the military junta and NLD leaders. His recent know-it-all stories have raised eyebrows among Burmese and Burma watchers, and stirred strong feelings.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Many serious Burmese watchers question Mitton’s understanding of Burma and his analysis of the current situation. Donald M. Seekins, a professor of Burmese history at Meio University in Japan, said recently, "Mitton has been advertising for the junta."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Inside Burma, respected journalists and writers who have seen Mitton’s pieces joke about his stories. "Mitton seems to have a spy network everywhere in Burma," quipped U Sein Win. "He is a laughing stock among us—if you are bored with politics in Burma, you will be amused (reading Mitton’s stories). His inside stories are very entertaining," the respected journalist in Rangoon said.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But junta officials appear to be pleased with his "entertaining stories." Mitton has been allowed in and out of Burma many times, and some high-ranking officials, including the junta’s powerful Secretary One Lt-Gen Khin Nyunt, have given him exclusive interviews.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Martin Smith, who has written several reports and books on Burma, was also allowed into the country recently. However, his reputation is still largely intact, as he has long been highly regarded as an authority on Burma. Stephen Brookes, who used to work for the defunct Asia Times newspaper and was the only foreign journalist with regular access to Rangoon for several years, has less impressive Burma credentials. His stance is clear: The evils are not so bad. Brookes’ articles sometimes appear in The Myanmar Times, edited by Ross Dunkley, an Australian now based in Rangoon. Dunkley is also dependent on the junta’s favour, without which it would be totally impossible to run a newspaper in Rangoon.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Lintner thinks the military intelligence must have discovered that Mitton knows nothing about Burma, and therefore decided that he would be easy to manipulate. "Neither Mitton’s nor Smith’s reports are objective and fair. Mitton’s reports reflect his ignorance and are simply bad journalism," said Lintner. The Swedish journalist thinks that Mitton’s failure to do his homework has backfired badly, leaving his reputation in tatters. He adds that Mitton’s credibility among diplomats and serious journalists is zero."</dd>

<p>The version on Adèle de France published on 22/4 was more correct than the actual one I think.</p>

<dd>Dear Mathieu</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Thank you very much for your message. I was wondering what was the origin of the idea that Adèle de France was born in 1170 -- an idea that was widespread on Wikipedia 6 months ago -- and now, thanks to you, I know! So it was Anthelme, in 1725, who published this opinion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But it is often the case that 18th century historians made mistakes that later historians have been able to correct. In this case, Anthelme is wrong. I am certain, for two reasons.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>1. The original agreement to marry Adèle to Richard was made in 1169. Admittedly it is not impossible for such an agreement to be made, in principle, before a child is born, but there is another reason also:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2. In 1174, as is stated in the Wikipedia article (and I have checked the documents for this) "le pape Alexandre III intervint pour le sommer [le = Henri II d'Angleterre], sous peine d'excommunication, de procéder au mariage convenu". If the girl was only 4 years old, this is impossible! A marriage would have been uncanonical! But if she was 14 years old, this would be normal, especially if there were rumours that Henri II was making the girl his own mistress instead of marrying her to his son.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The documents are printed in full in the big biography of Philippe Auguste (Alexander Cartellieri, /Philipp II. August, König von Frankreich/. 4 vols. Leipzig, 1899 sqq.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think it would be a good idea to add a note to the "Adèle de France" article mentioning Anthelme's opinion, because I am sure other people, too, will find it and wonder if it is true. But, as I say, I am sure it is wrong.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>With best wishes</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Andrew</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I have just seen that the date at which the pope threatened to excommunicate Henry II if he did not immediately marry Adèle to Richard is 1177, not 1174. I had failed to correct this on the French Wikipedia, though I corrected it on the English one. I have changed it now.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The argument remains the same. It still shows that Adèle was born long before 1170: she could not be married at 7 years old, but she definitely ought to be married (and not kept as Henry II's mistress) if she was 17 years old.</dd>

<p>Hi. You looked at this author's <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lynn_Coulter_e779.html" title="Lynn Coulter">article</a> when I asked for help on the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Books_d145.html#Advice_wanted_re:_author.27s_notability" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Books">WikiProject Books talk page</a>.

The author has made some edits to further establish her notability; I think it's still borderline at best, but others may disagree.</p>
<p>Once again some objective third parties with a good feel for what constitutes author notability would be helpful in sizing this one up given the recent changes. If you get the chance, would you take a look? (Although I've nominated the article for "delete", I welcome a reasoned "keep" opinion is just as much as a "delete".) --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A. B.">A.

<p>Hi! Really sorry for having taken me so long to respond. The article looks significantly better after your edits — all the references make it look authoritative indeed. As for the title, we should use the one that is most popular in English. If it really is this one, then it's OK (it's certainly not popular in Bulgaria, where it's called the "Rebellion of Asen and Peter"). I'd be happy to provide further help, so don't hesitate to leave a message :) <i><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Todor</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodorBozhinov_c2c4.html" title="User talk:TodorBozhinov">→</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Bozhinov</a></i> 11:27, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I noticed that you put in an article for Sao Saimong. That was nice of you. One minor quibble, he was allowed to visit Kengtung after his release from detention. In fact, in 1969, a year after his release, he became an ordained monk in one of the Kengtung monasteries for a period of time.</p>

<p>I am not harcore about such things. Since you are more familiar with naming conventions of that period, I won't oppose any revert you make, as long as you make a note explaining that in the edit box (and not something like "reverting vandalism" or "reverting somebody who doesn't know what they are talking about"). It seems to me that there would probably be a mix of "surnames" and given names that would be given alphabetical priority. But the fact that surnames them weren't really surnames could make sense, and honestly I don't know much about the topic to have much of an opinion. But to reitierate, whatever you, or other working on such topics, decide, I won't oppose.--<big><a href="../../../e/s/p/User%7EEsprit15d_69ef.html" title="User:Esprit15d"><font face="Sylfaen">Esprit15d</font></a></big> (<a href="../../../e/s/p/User_talk%7EEsprit15d_0875.html" title="User talk:Esprit15d">talk</a> ¤ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Esprit15d_a6e0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Esprit15d">contribs</a>) 15:31, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

(I added a separate article on <a href="../../../l/a/l/Lallemantia_oil.html" title="Lallemantia oil">lallemantia oil</a>.) It got me thinking about other "paleobotanicals" - the use of <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grain_amaranth.html" title="Grain amaranth">grain amaranth</a> as a <a href="../../../s/t/a/Staple_food.html" title="Staple food">staple food</a> in the <a href="../../../m/a/y/Mayan.html" title="Mayan">Mayan</a> empire, <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quinoa.html" title="Quinoa">quinoain</a> the <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andes.html" title="Andes">Andes</a>, and even <a href="http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=16428051" class="external text" title="http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=16428051" rel="nofollow">Khorasan wheat</a>] in ancient <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iran</a>. Sticking closer to oils, there's also balanos oil, which was apparently used in the ancient world as a highly valued perfume base oil. There's also <a href="../../../f/a/l/False_flax_oil.html" title="False flax oil">false flax oil</a>, which was widely used as a lamp oil through the <a href="../../../1/8/t/18th_century.html" title="18th century">18th century</a>.</p>
<p>It seems to me that there's a decent article to be written in there somewhere. It's very well documented that the world's food supply has become highly focused on just a few species in the last 40 years (e.g. 40-50% of all calories from <i>three</i> plant species). What was the situation like when the world was at the other extreme of food supply diversity and economic development? I think it'd be fascinating to take a look at the world of "economic plants", staple crops, or food plants in general in past millenia.

<p>Hi, I noticed You on polish Wiki (where I work mainly), and as You were the only one with a good knowledge of (anc.) greek, I write to You. Please look at <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finger_%28gesture%29.html" title="Finger (gesture)">Finger (gesture)</a>. It reads - in Origin section - that this gesture was known already in ancient Greece, and cites <i>Clouds</i> as the first known literary source of that. The only place, where it could fit, is between verses 650 and 660, when Socrates asks Strepsiades if he knows about dactyls, and the latter answers - well, what he answers, depends on translation, but:</p>
<ul>
<li>two polish translations don't mention it (the gesture), or make it unconnected with - explicit - showing the middle finder only;</li>
<li>the same thing here: <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext01/cloud10.txt" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext01/cloud10.txt" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> (<i>Strep. What else but this finger? Formerly, indeed, when I was yet a boy, this here!</i>);</li>
<li>it exists in <a href="http://www.mala.bc.ca/~johnstoi/aristophanes/clouds.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.mala.bc.ca/~johnstoi/aristophanes/clouds.htm" rel="nofollow">this</a> translation, however it is not explained if it's genuine, or the paraphrase.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, can You look at the ancient greek text of the Clouds and just check it, or better, translate those verses?</p>

<p>Thank you so much for noticing and starting the new article on De Viris Illustribus. I will in fact be adding to this, so be sure to keep a watch on it. I like your wording for the heading, which is a great improvement from my writing. In my future additions and amplification, please make any improvements you feel are appropriate. Also go ahead and drop me a note, if you have any more of those excellent hints. For all this <b>outstanding</b> help you have given me, I will let you in on some of my theories about Petrarch. Some will definitely be controversial. However with your extensive background of ancient history and your <b>extensive</b> knowledge of the many languages, then if anyone can understand what I am saying it will be you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Petrarch wrote some items that are well known to the world that have been written in a code. For lack of a better name I refer to this as The Petrarch Code. Some of these items are so controversial that when others hear of my theories then there is much said. I have talked some of this on Wikipedia and recently they have all but closed me out. I suspect they soon will. The material is so controversial that you would think I was talking of something much worse than the most gross material you have ever heard of (i.e. dirty language, dirty pictures, religious concepts, etc), however all I am taking of is finding coded literature. It is all quite clean and above board. I am just a simple retiree with a hobby.</li>
<li>Petrarch wrote several other lists of De Viris Illustrious that are known under other names (i.e. "pen names"). This is even more controversial. There are several that are watching me quite close on Wikipedia, so if you would like to send me an e-mail for details on this I will gladly furnish any details. You will understand what I am saying with your extensive knowledge of ancient history. I suspect I have only a few more days and they will shut down my material all together. I have been pre-warned about this already by several Admisnistrators of Wikipedia. I doubt if they will let me continue till the end of the month. Even this simple list of <i>Lives</i> was removed, basically because of my input. It was put there to see how long it was going to stay there, however I was surprised it was pulled this quick. I thought it would last a week or so. Notice that all it was, was a list of names all of which Wikipedia has information on. That's why I linked everyone of them, to show I was not in fact just making up this information. Obviously you know of this list. I won't be adding anything to your new article for a few months, until I can see if this will stay since you put it as a new article. Anything I might add now will be removed (guaranteed!), so I will hold off for now.</li>
<li>Petrarch wrote his grand epic poem written in hexameters. Recently I asked what hexameters was on Wikipedia. It was explained further to me, so now I have a much better idea what it is. I have read (somewhat) this book of Africa. It is of one great commander for Italy called Scipio <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornelius.html" title="Cornelius">Cornelius</a>. Now read <a href="http://faithofgod.net/TyNT/ac.htm#10:1" class="external text" title="http://faithofgod.net/TyNT/ac.htm#10:1" rel="nofollow">this</a> and you will see what I mean of that which is controversial. All of Petrarch's other list of Lives (in code) have in common the idea that they all start with the first rulers of some Empire, Dynasty, or Country. They also have in common that all the information came from the ancient historians Livy and Polybius. (Apparently Petrarch studied them much). They have other "themes" as well.</li>
<li>Jerome has a list of 134 Lives called De Viris Illustribus. Each "Christian author" has his own Chapter. Chapter 135 is of Jerome himself saying what he wrote, so therefore there are 134 <i>Lives.</i> (FYI: I am not a religious person. Have no bias one way or they other). Chapter 66 is of one <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornelius.html" title="Cornelius">Cornelius</a>, a bishop for Rome. With your <b>extensive</b> knowledge of ancient people, I'll bet you don't know most of these "Christians". One <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornelius.html" title="Cornelius">Cornelius</a> is a most <b>significant</b> person to Petrarch, since he wrote about him in his most <b>significant</b> work (of which he was crowned poet laureate for). The number <b>66</b> is most significant, since it is the number of books in the Bible. How many letters does <i>Liber Sine Nomine</i> consist of?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Acts of the Apostles has in Chapter 1 (verse 3) the number 40. Add <b>40</b> to <b>66</b> and you get 106, which just happens to be the number <a href="../../../o/n/_/On_Famous_Women_bf64.html" title="On Famous Women">On Famous Women</a> Boccaccio did (which was influenced by Petrarch). Acts has 28 chapters. Now add <b>28</b> to <b>106</b> and you get <b>134</b> = the amount of <i>Lives</i> in Jerome's list. At this point in time I don't dare say anything more. I'll see if this gets to you if you send me an e-mail or respond here. I doubt very much it will be allowed for you to see! Unless they are not paying attention to your name at this time.</li>
</ul>
<p>For your information my background is in hardware electronics and real estate speculation. In other words, about as far from ancient history and religion as you could get. I am not even a good writer, as you can see. So I could not have made all this up, since it takes the advanced encyclopedic knowledge that only Petrarch had. --<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Coldwell_1d90.html" title="User:Doug Coldwell">Doug</a> 20:46, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Appreciate your answer. If you see any improvements that you feel should be done in the future on <i><b>De Viris Illustribus</b></i>, feel free to make them. I'm sure whatever you do will be an improvement of my work. As you already know there are 19 letters to <i>Liber Sine Nomine</i>. Interestingly there are also 19 letters to "Volume Without A Title" (just count them). This just happens to look a lot like the English name for this book called: <i>Book Without A Name.</i> These words of <i><b>"volume without a title"</b></i> are in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2708.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2708.htm" rel="nofollow">Jerome's Chapter 80</a>. This Chapter also just happens to speak of a young man in "Africa" (perhaps in the mid thirties) that wrote a poem in hexameters. Also as you already know <i>Liber Sine Nomine</i> is a <b>epitome</b> of <i>Epistolae Familiares.</i> I will not say there are 19 New Testament books mentioned here; however they all just happen to have the same number of letters and the same vowels. Please make any improvements to my work you may see in the future since you are a <b>much better</b> writer than I am. I would really appreciate it. Thanks! --<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Coldwell_1d90.html" title="User:Doug Coldwell">Doug</a> 00:43, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
P.S. Carthage (which still has 8 letters) is of Greek roots and as you know has a lack of <b>people</b> (of 6 letters) to this day since it is in ruins (as it was in Petrarch's time).<br />
Firmianus has 9 letters. Lactantius has 10 letters. <i>Epistolae has 9 letters. Familiares has 10 letters.</i> I'll just throw this out and if you want any details I will furnish: Acts of the Apostles is a list of 28 moral biographies that Petrarch wrote. They start with the first Persian ruler, <a href="../../../c/y/r/Cyrus.html" title="Cyrus">Cyrus</a> the Great. Chapter 1 is of him and the <a href="../../../c/y/r/Cyrus_Cylinder_33a6.html" title="Cyrus Cylinder">Cyrus Cylinder</a>, which just happens to have <b>40</b> lines. Then it goes into the first great Macedonian ruler, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_II_of_Macedon_e643.html" title="Philip II of Macedon">Philip II of Macedon</a>, then to Alexander the Great. Chapter 9 is of <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appius_Claudius_Caecus_5900.html" title="Appius Claudius Caecus">Appius Claudius Caecus</a>, while Chapter 10 is <a href="../../../p/u/b/Publius_Cornelius_Scipio_Africanus_Major_96b1.html" title="Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus Major">Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus Major</a>. I have all 28 names. Petrarch refers to this as: "Chronicle of Universay History of 28 homilies". It so happens it is chronicle, since it goes in reverse chronological order. Also it just so happens the way it is written they are all connected in some sort of relationship (some a direct blood line, but not always). Petrarch has another <i>De Viris Illustrius</i> that starts with Adam. Boccaccio's list <a href="../../../o/n/_/On_Famous_Women_bf64.html" title="On Famous Women">On Famous Women</a> starts with the first woman of the Bible. Boccaccio also has a list that starts with Adam and Eve. --<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Coldwell_1d90.html" title="User:Doug Coldwell">Doug</a> 00:43, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Andrew. Since you're our Byzantine historiography expert, I wonder if you can help me. I've written a stubbish article on the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prosopography_of_the_Byzantine_World_c3c7.html" title="Prosopography of the Byzantine World">Prosopography of the Byzantine World</a> project. However, I'm looking for some references to demonstrate that it's not just notable because of <a href="../../../a/v/e/Averil_Cameron_46eb.html" title="Averil Cameron">Averil Cameron</a>'s association and the fact that the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Academy_dea7.html" title="British Academy">British Academy</a> are involved. I believe that there are some papers out there than mention it, but I don't have access to JSTOR and the like. If you do, is there anything of interest has been written about the PBW project?

<dd>I've been planning on writing or translating an article on you for a long time, but to be honest the main reason was that I was dying to have a Latin equivalent of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedians_with_articles_1b6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedians with articles">Wikipedia:Wikipedians with articles</a> ;)</dd>
<dd>Thank you, you know I am always searching for the right word. [Digression (a joke once told to me by my Yiddish teacher): "How do you say 'the right word' in French?" "<i>Le vrai mot</i>?" "No... that's... not quite the mot juste." I guess that's funnier when told by a Yiddish teacher ;) ] Do you have any suggestion regarding "food writer(s)" [see the disputatio page]? And what about the names of the various schools for which I was unable to find a precident: often if I can't find the Latin name, alumni will know of a source.</dd>

<p>Hi Andrew My son Ben is doing a project at school on the Ancient Greeks. He's keen to write about their diet and recipes. He really wants to make something simple which the ancient Greeks would have eaten and take it in to school as part of his project. Do you have a simple and tasty 'ancient' recipe which his fellow 8 year olds might like to try? Any interestng, child freindly web links or info would be greatly appreciated too. It seems like a nice entry point to the fascinating world of the ancient Greeks, so I'm keen to encourage his enthusiasm.

<p>I note you are considering writing about comic books. There is, I believe, already an article s.v. Liber Comicus or somesuch. Obviously that's not a great translation, given what it litterally means. The expression I most commonly hear in Neo-Latin circuls is <i>liber nubeculatus</i>, calqued off of Italian <i>fumetto</i>.

<p>Hi Andrew, I deleted the <span class="reference"><sup id="fn_polytonic_back"><a href="#fn_polytonic" title="">polytonic</a></sup></span> formula in an article you recently created, I think Philaenis, if memory serves. I did this mostly because I don't understand its purpose. It seems to make greek look very weird to my eyes. Was there a reason you had this in there or was it just a copy/paste thing? If it was just a copy paste thing, could you still explain to me the use of the formula?

<dd>Thanks for asking, Josh. Yes, it was copy-and-paste. On this occasion I had written the English Wikipedia article first and then did a Latin version (sometimes it's the other way round!) The template seems regularly used on English Wikipedia -- I never really found out why, I just follow suit -- but it doesn't seem to have the same effect on the font that it does on Vicipaedia. You were right to delete it. <font face="Gill Sans"><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Dalby_694d.html" title="User:Andrew Dalby"><font color="green">And</font></a><b><strong class="selflink">rew D</strong></b><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Dalby_Bibliography_d500.html" title="User:Andrew Dalby/Bibliography"><font color="green">alby</font></a></font> 17:11, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The polytonic template, <i>e.g.</i> {{polytonic|αἶξ}}, ensures that the accents on words like <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">αἶξ</span> are rendered properly on all browsers. Some browsers (I believe Internet Explorer through version 6) won't render these characters correctly unless given a little "help". Similarly for arbitrary Unicode characters, for which there is a Unicode template. The polytonic template is not strictly necessary on all Greek words in an article, but if some words use it, it's probably best that all do for consistency in appearance. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 18:05, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since you're an expert in the field, I think it would be useful if you could review <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_cuisine.html" title="Greek cuisine">Greek cuisine</a> (which is about <i>modern</i> Greek cuisine). There has been some dispute there about how much to emphasize the Ottoman element compared to the Byzantine and ancient elements. My own take on the issue is that western romantic philhellism and Greek nationalism over-emphasize the ancient survivals and downplay the Ottoman heritage. Though you only devote a few pages to this in <i>Siren Feasts</i>, I'm sure your contributions would be very helpful.

Many of them are of stub and start class, but a few are of B or A caliber. Getting a simple assessment rating can help us start moving many of these biographies to a higher quality article.

<p>Hello Andrew, Thanks for the message and the help you offer. Sure, it seems real good to me. I wanted to tell you that I'm really impressed by your linguistic skills and general knowledge, congratulations! It's great to get to see erudite people around. I used to work on the Occitan wikipedia and tried to weave the links between the other wikipedias and add some comments or corrections whenever I felt that it was a more appropriate. I apologize if that might have offended or bothered you. I'm not in the Occitan wiki any more since there have been some tendencies of creating restrictions which seemed inappropriate to me lately and though it's difficult for me I've made the decision to move to the Catalan viquipèdia and there bring some little help of mine (about Occitan and maybe other matters). I will also pay a closer look on the Occitan issue in the English Wikipedia but I sometimes have the feeling that my English is not as good as I wish it should be. Thanks again and I hope you have real success in the elaboration of your cider and the other less serious matters! Have a nice day, week and year! See you! <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapsot_4367.html" title="User:Capsot">Capsot</a> aka Claudi Balaguer</p>

<dd>Yes, Galf, I'll have a look at those articles.</dd>
<dd>In <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garcia_de_Orta_751e.html" title="Garcia de Orta">Garcia de Orta</a> I'm inclined to change "medical things" back to "materia medica". So far as I know, "medical things" doesn't mean anything in English. "Materia medica" is a real phrase that <i>is</i> used in English (at least by pharmacists), and it is the exact equivalent of Garcia's <i>cousas medicinais</i>. <font face="Gill Sans"><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Dalby_694d.html" title="User:Andrew Dalby"><font color="green">And</font></a><b><strong class="selflink">rew D</strong></b><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Dalby_Bibliography_d500.html" title="User:Andrew Dalby/Bibliography"><font color="green">alby</font></a></font> 16:01, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You are right about that, however, I'd like to point out your own commentary on it: "at least by pharmacists"... Medical matters pehaps?

<dl>
<dd>Fair enough. It's true that "materia medica" is not in the first English dictionary I checked. I knew the phrase only because I used to be a medical librarian. The precise English words would be "medicinal substances". Shall I put that? <font face="Gill Sans"><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Dalby_694d.html" title="User:Andrew Dalby"><font color="green">And</font></a><b><strong class="selflink">rew D</strong></b><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Dalby_Bibliography_d500.html" title="User:Andrew Dalby/Bibliography"><font color="green">alby</font></a></font> 17:03, 6 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I suppose I could agree with the substances...although I personally like the sound of medical "things", specially because "cousas" is such an archaic word and the title has a sort of mystical tone. But this is an encyclopedias, after all. BTW, have you spent time on those two excellent articles :-)? <a href="../../../g/a/l/User%7EGalf_4119.html" title="User:Galf">Galf</a> 17:18, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Exactly. It is very odd indeed. I think it was because of that extreme oddity that the article I originally read set out the theory that, in reality, he was Carolina's son, not the judge's, and the judge dealt with it in this strange way to spare her disgrace.

<p>Dear Mr. Dalby,</p>
<p>First, I would like to say that I am a big fan of your <i>Dictionary of Languages</i>. It contains a lot of fun information, and I read it often.</p>
<p>I read your biography on Wikipedia and your web page because I was curious about your education (i.e., where you went to school, what you studied, and for how long). I think that those pages would be better off with that information.</p>
<p>Also, although I enjoy your <i>Dictionary of Languages,</i> I think that it would be more valuable if it were expanded — although I understand such a project could easily get out of hand. The <i>Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics</i> contains advanced linguistic information about languages, and general encyclopedias like <i>Encyclopedia Americana</i> contain basic grammatical information. I think that if you threw in some of the grammar found in those works and maybe a list of common phrases (like <i>World Book Encyclopedia</i> and <i>Encarta</i> do), readers would be relieved of having to read three different works.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<dd>Hi Mr. Dalby. My aplogies for the late reply. I hope you don't mind me putting that information into your <i>Wikipedia</i> article. Let me know if it doesn't flow as well as it did before. I'm sort of a biography nut. I'm especially interested in multilingual people and those with broad knowledge. Thank you for the replies, and I wish you all the best.--<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Maxwell_5cdc.html" title="User:Richard Maxwell">Richard Maxwell</a> 19:33, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As someone who has written extensively about food, do you think you could have a glance at <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subtlety.html" title="Subtlety">subtlety</a> and <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entremet.html" title="Entremet">entremet</a>? Do you know if this is an accurate description of how food historians define the two terms?</p>

<p>You speak IPA don't you? The article could use it...<a href="../../../g/a/l/User%7EGalf_4119.html" title="User:Galf">Galf</a> 14:38, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just curious about one thing, you used a different symbol for the s in "das" that you used for the one in "Lágrimas". Speaking out loud in portuguese they seem to be the same kind of s, but I don't know IPA.<a href="../../../g/a/l/User%7EGalf_4119.html" title="User:Galf">Galf</a> 16:14, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Well, you're better at Portuguese than I am! My teacher taught me, and my grammar book confirms, that when a final -s is followed by a voiced consonant (e.g. l-) it becomes voiced (like the j- in <i>jogo</i>). Since the -s of lagrimas is followed by nothing, it certainly remains unvoiced (like the ch- in <i>chuva</i>). If you feel that the -s of das, in this phrase, is like the ch- in <i>chuva</i>, not like the j- in <i>jogo</i>, then by all means change it from ʒ to ʃ -- I shan't mind! <font face="Gill Sans"><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Dalby_694d.html" title="User:Andrew Dalby"><font color="green">And</font></a><b><strong class="selflink">rew D</strong></b><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Dalby_Bibliography_d500.html" title="User:Andrew Dalby/Bibliography"><font color="green">alby</font></a></font> 19:49, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Andrew, I'm sorry, but after reading your comment 3 times I still couldn't understand it...the only difference i spot between the two sounds is that between <i>das</i> and <i>Lágrimas</i> the sounds are a bit more connected, but that could be my pronunciation. is the ʒ for that? or is it for a more "z" sound? Is there any good IPA reference for Portuguese you could suggest? or just give me another example of ʒ and ʃ for comparison?<a href="../../../g/a/l/User%7EGalf_4119.html" title="User:Galf">Galf</a> 00:17, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>What you call "connected" is the difference, yes. Look at <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portuguese_phonology.html#Fricatives" title="Portuguese phonology">Portuguese phonology#Fricatives</a>. They use the two examples I give (jogo for the ʒ sound, chuva for the ʃ sound), but also the examples of felizmente (for the ʒ sound) and isto (for the ʃ sound).</dd>
<dd>I learned from a Portuguese teacher (who had studied phonetics) but the written source I checked yesterday was R. C. Willis, <i>An essential course in modern Portuguese</i> (Harrap, 1965) p. 25. Well, Galf, I think that's the best I can do on a Wikipedia page. As I said before, if you disagree with me, you're free to change the transcription. But to go further, you might need to find a friend who has studied phonetics, and listen to yourselves making these sounds over a few glasses of beer or wine!
