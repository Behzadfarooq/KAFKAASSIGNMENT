<p>Born on 26 September 1959 to newly-arrived Dutch migrants, Bolt spent his childhood in remote rural areas such as <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tarcoola%2C_South_Australia_379f.html" title="Tarcoola, South Australia">Tarcoola</a>, while his father worked as a schoolteacher and principal. After graduating from secondary school, Bolt travelled and worked overseas before returning to Australia and completing a year of university studies. He quit after obtaining a cadetship at <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Age_3d42.html" title="The Age">The Age</a></i>, a Melbourne <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadsheet.html" title="Broadsheet">broadsheet</a> newspaper.</p>
<p>He worked for <i>The Age</i> in various roles, including as a sports writer, prior to joining <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Herald_%28Australia%29_489c.html" title="The Herald (Australia)">The Herald</a></i>, which in 1990 merged with <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sun_News-Pictorial_6dcf.html" title="The Sun News-Pictorial">The Sun News-Pictorial</a></i> to form the <i>Herald Sun</i>. Bolt also worked as a political advisor to members of the Australian Labor Party.</p>
<p>He is married to fellow <i>Herald Sun</i> columnist, Sally Morrell. They have three young children.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Bolt_53dd.html" title="Edit section: Controversy and criticism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Controversy and criticism</span></h2>
<p>Bolt is a vigorous exponent of largely conservative political and social views. His statements are sometimes controversial; he says that his columns are well researched and based on fact, rather than popular opinion. He denies the existence of the <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stolen_Generation_03cd.html" title="Stolen Generation">Stolen Generation</a> of <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Aborigines_7c1a.html" title="Australian Aborigines">Australian Aborigines</a>, argues that the dangers of <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming.html" title="Global warming">global warming</a> have been greatly exaggerated and he strongly supported the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq_War_58f4.html" title="Iraq War">Iraq War</a> in 2003.</p>
<p>Bolt became involved in a heated dispute with <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Marr_%28journalist%29_4b72.html" title="David Marr (journalist)">David Marr</a> following the <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_21.html" title="July 21">21 July</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> episode of <i><a href="../../../m/e/d/Media_Watch_ff08.html" title="Media Watch">Media Watch</a></i> in which Marr claimed that Bolt's column "A Kick Up The Arts" (<a href="../../../j/u/n/June_2.html" title="June 2">2 June</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>) had unfairly represented author Alison Broinowski. Bolt had claimed Broinowski, a recipient of three taxpayer-funded arts grants, had written a book saying the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002_Bali_bombing_e614.html" title="2002 Bali bombing">2002 Bali bombing</a> "was largely Australia’s fault". Marr said Bolt had misquoted the author, who had in fact written that "racist bigots in Malaysia" thought Australia deserved the Bali bombing, and that he had also erred on the number of grants Broinowski had received. (Marr later retracted the second accusation, although he pointed out that Broinowski had received no arts grant since 1985). In a bitter exchange aired through both the <i>Herald Sun</i> and Media Watch, Bolt demanded Marr apologise for lying about him, while Marr countered that Bolt liked dishing out criticism, but could not take it himself<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s906782.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s906782.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Bolt frequently accuses the ABC, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sydney_Morning_Herald_4298.html" title="The Sydney Morning Herald">The Sydney Morning Herald</a></i>, <i>The Age</i> and some other newspapers of strong <a href="../../../l/e/f/Left-wing_politics.html" title="Left-wing politics">left-wing</a> bias.<a href="http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/and_here_is_the_news_from_the_abc/" class="external autonumber" title="http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/and_here_is_the_news_from_the_abc/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>In June 2003 Bolt published an article which quoted a <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classified.html" title="Classified">classified</a> intelligence document. This document was written by then intelligence analyst for the Office of National Assessments, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Wilkie_1d90.html" title="Andrew Wilkie">Andrew Wilkie</a>, who had quit his government job over the Iraq invasion. Wilkie ran for the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Greens_3689.html" title="Australian Greens">Greens</a> against <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Howard_1ea1.html" title="John Howard">John Howard</a> in his local electorate in the 2004 election. It was claimed, but never proven, that someone in <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Downer_2265.html" title="Alexander Downer">Alexander Downer</a>'s office had leaked the document to Bolt.<a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/bolt-from-blue-sets-tongues-wagging/2006/03/24/1143083983213.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/bolt-from-blue-sets-tongues-wagging/2006/03/24/1143083983213.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> The Australian Federal Police says it doesn't have any "admissible evidence" to identify the culprit.<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s1766227.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s1766227.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>Bolt accused journalists of "passing on as fact the propaganda of terrorists" in their coverage of the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Israel-Lebanon_conflict_7601.html" title="2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict">2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict</a>, especially claims that wrote an Israeli missile had been fired through the roof of a Lebanese Red Cross ambulance.<a href="http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/column_not_the_whole_truth/" class="external autonumber" title="http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/column_not_the_whole_truth/" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> He cited photographic evidence from media coverage to argue that the initial reports were clearly false, noting an essay<a href="http://www.zombietime.com/fraud/ambulance/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.zombietime.com/fraud/ambulance/" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> at the <a href="../../../z/o/m/Zombietime.html" title="Zombietime">Zombietime</a> website "whose research I’ve drawn on". He followed up with posts on his blog, including a detailed rebuttal<a href="http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/sticking_by_the_hoax/" class="external autonumber" title="http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/sticking_by_the_hoax/" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> to two stories criticising him in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Australian_d6f4.html" title="The Australian">The Australian</a></i>, an independent debunking of the "hoax" by an Australian military source<a href="http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/the_ambulance_hoax_why_no_missile_could_have_done_this/" class="external autonumber" title="http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/the_ambulance_hoax_why_no_missile_could_have_done_this/" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> and a detailed analysis of contradictions in newspaper reports.<a href="http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/fake_but_true_the_age_defends_the_holey_ambulance_hoax/" class="external autonumber" title="http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/fake_but_true_the_age_defends_the_holey_ambulance_hoax/" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></p>
<p>Bolt also denounces the state <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Labor_Party_d687.html" title="Australian Labor Party">Labor</a> government of Victoria (led by Premier <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Bracks_999c.html" title="Steve Bracks">Steve Bracks</a>) for its refusal to build more dams or re-direct rivers to deal with the on-going water shortage crisis. He commonly refers to those who harbour left-wing and green ideologies (university students in particular) as victims of "<a href="../../../g/r/o/Groupthink.html" title="Groupthink">groupthink</a>" and is a relentless critic of broadcaster and journalist <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phillip_Adams_40e4.html" title="Phillip Adams">Phillip Adams</a>.</p>
<p>Bolt has frequently clashed with <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Manne_eecf.html" title="Robert Manne">Robert Manne</a>, Professor of <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_science.html" title="Political science">Politics</a> at <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Trobe_University_e4b2.html" title="La Trobe University">La Trobe University</a>, notably about the <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stolen_Generation_03cd.html" title="Stolen Generation">Stolen Generation</a>. Bolt claims that there were no large-scale removals of children "for purely racist reasons". After Bolt challenged Manne to "name just 10" children stolen for racial reasons,<a href="http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,19610693-25717,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,19610693-25717,00.html" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> Manne gave him a list of 12 names which, Bolt contends, includes children rescued from sexual abuse and removed for other humanitarian reasons.<a href="http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/stolen_generations_my_writers_festival_speech/" class="external autonumber" title="http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/stolen_generations_my_writers_festival_speech/" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> Manne has recently argued that Bolt's failure to address the wealth of documentary and anecdotal evidence demonstrating the existence of the Stolen Generation amounts to a clear case of historical <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denialism.html" title="Denialism">denialism</a><a href="http://www.theage.com.au/news/robert-manne/the-cruelty-of-denial/2006/09/08/1157222325367.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theage.com.au/news/robert-manne/the-cruelty-of-denial/2006/09/08/1157222325367.html" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>. Bolt has noted multiple incidents of contemporary Aboriginal children being left "in grave danger that we would not tolerate for children of any other race because we are so terrified of the 'stolen generations' myth."<a href="http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/another_stolen_life/" class="external autonumber" title="http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/another_stolen_life/" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></p>
<p>Bolt argues that taxpayer-funded arts grants, particularly in <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_%28Australia%29_71e6.html" title="Victoria (Australia)">Victoria</a>, are in his opinion spent on "festivals for the wealthy elite," and funding for left-wing writers. He denounces the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Greens_3689.html" title="Australian Greens">Greens</a>, claiming that they preach "nature worship" and suggests that this is a contemporary manifestation of <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazism</a><sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Bolt_53dd.html" title="Edit section: Defamation and claims of inaccuracy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Defamation and claims of inaccuracy</span></h2>
<p>In 2002, Magistrate Jelena Popovic was awarded $246,000 damages for <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slander_and_libel.html" title="Slander and libel">defamation</a> after suing Bolt and the publishers of the Herald Sun over a December 13, 2000 column in which he claimed she had "hugged two drug traffickers she let walk free". Popovic contended she had in fact shaken their hands to congratulate them on having completed a rehabilitation program.</p>
<p>The jury found that the article was not true, that it was not a faithful and accurate record of judicial proceedings, and that it was not fair comment on a matter of public interest. It found that the column had, however, been reasonable and not malicious.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> Bolt emerged from the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Court_of_Victoria_d197.html" title="Supreme Court of Victoria">Supreme Court</a> after the jury verdict, insisting his column had been accurate and that the mixed verdict was a victory for free speech.</p>
<p>His statement outside the court was harshly criticised by Supreme Court judge Bernard Bongiorno, who later overturned the jury’s decision, ruling that Bolt had not acted reasonably because he did not seek a response from Ms Popovic before writing the article and, in evidence given during the trial, showed he did not care whether or not the article was defamatory. Justice Bongiorno included $25,000 <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punitive_damages.html" title="Punitive damages">punitive damages</a> in his award against Bolt and the newspaper for both the "misleading" and "disingenuous" comments he had made outside court and the newspaper’s reporting of the jury’s decision. The Court of Appeal later reversed the $25,000 punitive damages, though it upheld the defamation finding, describing Bolt’s conduct as "at worst, dishonest and misleading and at best, grossly careless."<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2000 Bolt’s accuracy and honesty as a journalist was challenged in a book written by Ken Blyth, the captain of an oil tanker that was seized by pirates in the South China Sea. Bolt has denied Blyth's allegation.</p>
<p>In <i>Petro Pirates</i>, Ken Blyth related how his vessel, the MT <i>Petro Ranger</i>, along with all crew, was detained by Chinese authorities in <a href="../../../h/a/i/Haikou.html" title="Haikou">Haikou</a> Harbour in April and May 1998 after the pirates were apprehended. Blyth wrote that in May Bolt (then a journalist in News Ltd’s Hong Kong bureau) arrived beside the tanker in a sampan. The pair, separated by about 10 metres, had a brief shouted conversation, Blyth warning that Bolt risked being shot by the Chinese soldiers guarding the Petro Ranger. Blyth rejects as fanciful Bolt’s published claim<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> that he had yelled: "For God's sake don't come on board or they'll shoot us all" and says he did not ask Bolt to contact Foreign Affairs in Australia for him.</p>
<p>Bolt returned to the tanker the next day, but was intercepted by a military patrol boat and escorted to Haikou for questioning. Blyth claimed the reality did not match Bolt’s "brave tale" in his later articles<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup>. He disputed that Bolt refused to sign a confession that he had made up his earlier story. Blyth claimed Bolt did sign a statement admitting his story was "seriously inconsistent with facts" and wrote an apology. Blyth said Bolt’s "irresponsible and inaccurate" reports worsened his situation and led to tighter security than he had been experiencing.</p>
<p>In a blog posting <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup>in February 2007 Bolt described Blyth's claims as "a falsehood". He had "signed a statement agreeing that what <i>Blyth had told me</i> about the hijacking of his ship was seriously inconsistent with what the Chinese navy and police told me" (Bolt's emphasis).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Bolt_53dd.html" title="Edit section: Blog (previously On-line forum)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Blog (previously On-line forum)</span></h2>
<p>In May 2005, Bolt established an on-line forum in which readers could offer comments, feedback and questions in response to his columns. He posts some of these comments, together with brief responses, in the late afternoon of every business day, on the <i><a href="../../../h/e/r/Herald_Sun_1ee3.html" title="Herald Sun">Herald Sun</a></i> website. (The forum does not appear in print.) Despite its low budget format, the forum was a pioneering experiment in Internet-aided "interactive journalism". In July 2006, he moved to a more conventional <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blog.html" title="Blog">blog</a> format.</p>
<p>Bolt's blog covers a wide variety of topics, including climate change, the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation_9631.html" title="Australian Broadcasting Corporation">ABC</a> and issues concerned with <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>. It has a similar format to fellow conservative blogger <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Blair_6001.html" title="Tim Blair">Tim Blair</a>'s site, in that a large number of short snippets of news and culture are published. Bolt states that abusive posting on his blog will be banned, however opposing voices are not. The majority of posters on the site support Bolt's positions. The site Boltwatch <a href="http://boltwatch.blogspot.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://boltwatch.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> provides a forum for people who dispute the content and method by which Andrew Bolt's work is constructed.</p>
