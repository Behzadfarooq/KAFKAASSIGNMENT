<p>Hello, Andy mci, I'm <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a>. I noticed you were new, or at least that nobody has officially welcomed you yet, so let me be the first to say hello, give you some tips, and share a few useful links.</p>
<p>Here are some links you might find helpful:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../t/u/t/Wikipedia%7ETutorial_f7c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Tutorial">User tutorial</a></li>

</ul>
<p>I know they're a little boring (okay... a <i>lot</i> boring) but they may come in handy someday.</p>
<p>I give every newcomer two tips for adding content: <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_publisher_of_original_thought" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">cite references</a> whenever possible, and try to set aside any <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">personal points of view</a>. Aside from that, just be patient and receptive, ask questions whenever you need to, and have a good time.</p>
<p>Now that you have your own user name, you can sign your discussions on talk pages by typing four tildes (~~~~). This will automatically stamp your user name, the time, and the date. That will help other users reply to your posts. You may also want to <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUser_page_1e96.html" title="Wikipedia:User page">fill out your user page</a> to tell others a bit about yourself.</p>
<p>I hope this information is useful to you, and I'm looking forward to seeing your contributions. If you have any questions, feel free to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kafziel&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kafziel&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">contact me</a> for help.

<p>IF YOU WANT TO OFFER AN OPINION, DO SO ON VEINS ARTICLE FOR DELETION PAGE</p>
<p>In the demonata, Vein is quite a main character. She may have been killed in Lord Loss, but she appeared in Demon Theif because of the time difference. That meens she may appear in the upcomming "Bec" or other Kernal Fleck centerd books. Keep the artical for now and when "Bec" comes out I'll see. <b>this was left by <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDecboy_686b.html" title="User:Decboy">Decboy</a> at 16:02 on <a href="../../../1/1/t/11th_September_75c6.html" title="11th September">11th September</a>.</b></p>
<p>However, Grubbs is to be the main narrator, so Vein will not appear in books 5, 6, and maybe another. If it is announced that book 6 will be the last Grubbs narrated book, Vein should be kept.</p>
<p>Then why did you delete it? It's gone now and I blame you!</p>

<p>Hi Andy. Here are some comments I posted to the project discussion page of this article after I assessed it:</p>
<p>I gave this a "Stub" classification because there is only a short biography, a list of books and some trivia. After finishing, I knew only a little more about this person than before I had started.</p>
<p>Some suggestions: Expand the bio, and please include inline citations for your information. As things stand, this article is not sourced at all.</p>
<p>Instead of a list of books, consider discussing the impact the books (each series) have had on the public and literary community. Also, to be complete, please include the publisher and ISBN number for the books that you feel must be listed.</p>
<p>I also think this article might better be merged with the ones about this other series of books. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a> 17:51, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Forgot to add that the second paragraph in the lead would need to be deleted, since it doesn't reference anything from the body of the article. The lead should provide a concise summary of the article itself. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a> 18:12, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Frank Grimes was removed because he has his own page. And the way we decided to do it was that if a one-time or recurring character has their own page, they don't get mentioned on the one-time or recurring lists. Imagine how cluttered the recurring list would be if we mentioned EVERY recurring character. -- <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpion0422_af95.html" title="User:Scorpion0422">Scorpion0422</a> 23:31, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay. but i still think he deserves a small one sentence mention, as people searching for him who don't realise he has his own page would get lost.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndy_mci_a545.html" title="User:Andy mci">veon</a> 23:32, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's not true. Most people looking for his page wouldn't go to the one-timers section, they will enter "Frank Grimes" in the search box and get his page. -- <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpion0422_af95.html" title="User:Scorpion0422">Scorpion0422</a> 02:29, 12 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi, hope you don't mind me posting to your userpage but I'm trying to collect opinion on a proposal relating to The Simpsons and, despite posting to various talk pages, I've had no feedback at all (except from a co-planner). I don't mind if all the opinion is negative (then I'll just forget the idea) but I'd like it to get some visibiltiy. I'm not going to go implement it unless the consensus is positive.</p>
<p>I'm proposing changing the way we manage lists of songs in episodes. Please see <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_The_Simpsons_Proposal_for_managing_song_lists_on_Simpsons_episodes_5855.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject The Simpsons/Proposal for managing song lists on Simpsons episodes">Wikipedia:WikiProject The Simpsons/Proposal for managing song lists on Simpsons episodes</a> which has a full explanation of the proposal. Please leave comments there.</p>

<p>Hi - good work on the list updates.</p>
<p>I just updated the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_The_Simpsons_Example_generated_lists_9bc5.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject The Simpsons/Example generated lists">Wikipedia:WikiProject The Simpsons/Example generated lists</a> page and, as you can see, a few of the writers and directors have a '|' on the end of their names. You should move the bar to beyond the 'SourceEnd' tag, which will clean them up on the list.</p>
<p>Also, I happened to notice on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Telltale_Head_1a24.html" title="The Telltale Head">The Telltale Head</a> that the list of writers was previously:</p>
<pre>
 writer = <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Jean_f0a3.html" title="Al Jean">Al Jean</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Reiss_b1f9.html" title="Mike Reiss">Mike Reiss</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Simon_8808.html" title="Sam Simon">Sam Simon</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Groening_904f.html" title="Matt Groening">Matt Groening</a> |
</pre>
<p>And you changed it to:</p>
<pre>
writers =
<span style="font-family:monospace;">{{<a href="../../../l/i/s/Template%7EListGenBot-SourceStart_18af.html" title="Template:ListGenBot-SourceStart">ListGenBot-SourceStart</a>|SimpsonsWriters|SimpsonsWritersS01}}</span>

</pre>
<p>'writer' got changes to 'writers' (you can see this if you view the infobox now) and you added bars between the writers, which confuses the infobox. I think splitting the writers between lines is fine, you don't need any punctuation between them.</p>

<p>Hi, I just reverted your edit to the HP7 article. You added information about her recent dream in which she knew the Horcrux was in a hidden location in her fireplace. I think that this was just in her dream rather than in the book - correct me if I'm wrong. <span style="border: 2px solid #ba0000;"><font color="blue"><a href="../../../0/l/1/User%7E0L1_fd4f.html" title="User:0L1"><font color="blue">0L1</font></a> <a href="../../../0/l/1/User_talk%7E0L1_ee26.html" title="User talk:0L1"><font color="blue">Talk</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_0L1_d2cd.html" title="Special:Contributions/0L1"><font color="blue">Contribs</font></a> 21:09 20/12/2006 (UTC)</font></span></p>
<p>No, i disagree. She knew that it was hidden there in the dream, and I expect that she wouldn't have thought it was there unless she had planned it out.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndy_mci_a545.html" title="User:Andy mci">ANDY+MCI=Andy Mci</a> 12:48, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey I haven't talked to you since I started Wikipedia. I was going to ask whether or not vampaneze could flit. I would imagine so seeing that they are very closely related in powers to vampires, but I don't remember it ever being stated that a vampaneze ever flitted. I do remember when R.V. sped past Darren and cut him with his blades but I don't think that it was stated that he was flitting. I do also remember when Vancha's brother, Steve, and their followers sped off very fast, but once again I don't think that it was stated that he was flitting. I need your help because your the only person that I know that might know more about The Saga of Darren Shan than me. :-) Why1991 01:21, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, i read the saga ages ago, but as far as I can remember, yes, it never says Vampaneze can flit. But i don't think it shoul be ruled out that they do as i think they're pretty much the same apart from how much blood they drink and consequences of that.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndy_mci_a545.html" title="User:Andy mci">ANDY+MCI=Andy Mci</a> 10:50, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I thought that you might want to possibly add this to your userbox collection. One day I felt like making a userbox and I felt that this would be the perfect one!!!<br />

I cannot, as I would be suprised if you weren't also, very anxious for the next Demonata book to come out. I live in the U.S. and it's pretty sad because we are still awaiting the realease of the last Saga of Darren Shan book. No fear though, because I order all of my books from the U.K. so I finished the Saga at the same time you did. I will also have to order the next book in Demonata. Bec was pretty good, as were the other books, but I still don't see what the major overall storyline is going to be. All I know is that they need to assemble that sword that can destroy the connection between the Demonata and Earths universe, and that Lord Loss is evidently the main antagonist (at least so far) seeing that he has played a roll in each book. Demonata is still totally awesome, but I don't think that anything will be able to compare to the Saga. I guess I will have to see how it all plays out to make my final desicion on what is better though. What's your opinion? Well "good tidings" as they would say in Romeo and Juliet (I have to read that right now and my teacher is making it horrible). Please reply.<br />

<p>I actually think the Demonata is better, but hey, thats me. And just to be annoying, i'm going to point out its not necessarily a sword. I think the joint power of the 3 protagonists is the weapon. i'll take that userbox as well.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndy_mci_a545.html" title="User:Andy mci">Andy mci</a> 16:49, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, myself and Gran are currently working on getting Season 8 to Featured topic status. We're about a third of the way there. If you own the Season 8 DVDs, it would be a big help you could work on a page or two.
