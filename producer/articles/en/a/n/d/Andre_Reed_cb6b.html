<p>Reed was born in Allentown and began his football career at Allentown's <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_E._Dieruff_High_School_2e0c.html" title="Louis E. Dieruff High School">Dieruff High School</a>, where he played <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quarterback.html" title="Quarterback">quarterback</a> and competed in the East Penn Conference (now known as the <a href="../../../l/e/h/Lehigh_Valley_Conference_dc57.html" title="Lehigh Valley Conference">Lehigh Valley Conference</a>), which is known for producing top collegiate and NFL football talent. In his senior year (1981-1982), Reed helped lead Dieruff to an EPC tri-championship, tying for the championship with <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emmaus_High_School_47a8.html" title="Emmaus High School">Emmaus High School</a> and <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitehall_High_School_%28Pennsylvania%29_5490.html" title="Whitehall High School (Pennsylvania)">Whitehall High School</a>.</p>
<p>Reed then attended <a href="../../../k/u/t/Kutztown_University_of_Pennsylvania_00f3.html" title="Kutztown University of Pennsylvania">Kutztown University of Pennsylvania</a>, where he moved to the <a href="../../../w/i/d/Wide_receiver.html" title="Wide receiver">wide receiver</a> position and quickly drew the attention of the NFL for his speed and durability at the receiver position. In the 1985 NFL Draft, Reed was selected by the Buffalo Bills in the fourth round with the 86th overall selection.</p>

<p>Reed ranks near the top in nearly all NFL career statistical receiving categories. He is fifth in NFL history in total career receptions with 951 (behind only <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Rice_87b5.html" title="Jerry Rice">Jerry Rice</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cris_Carter_d0d3.html" title="Cris Carter">Cris Carter</a>, <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Brown_de57.html" title="Tim Brown">Tim Brown</a>, and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvin_Harrison_f0ed.html" title="Marvin Harrison">Marvin Harrison</a>), eighth in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_National_Football_League_receiving_yards_leaders_ff35.html" title="List of National Football League receiving yards leaders">NFL history in total career receiving yards</a> with 13,198. Reed is also tenth in NFL history in total career touchdown receptions with 87.</p>
<p>He also rushed for 500 yards and a touchdown on 75 carries. With the Bills, Reed played in four consecutive <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Bowl_21ed.html" title="Super Bowl">Super Bowls</a> (1991-1994) and was selected to the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Pro_Bowl_580f.html" title="Pro Bowl">Pro Bowl</a> in seven consecutive seasons (1988-1994).</p>
<p>Reed set season career highs with 90 receptions in 1994, 10 touchdowns in 1991, and 1,312 receiving yards in 1989.</p>
<p>A tribute to his incredible physical durability, Reed played in 234 NFL games between 1985 and 2000, <a href="../../../m/o/s/Most_games_played%2C_NFL_history_25ae.html" title="Most games played, NFL history">the 59th most games played by any player in NFL history</a>, including players in less physically demanding positions, such as kickers and punters.</p>

<p>In his four Super Bowls, Reed recorded 27 receptions, the second most total career Super Bowl receptions in NFL history (behind Rice's 33). His 323 total Super Bowl receiving yards are the third most in Super Bowl history (behind only Rice's 604 yards and <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lynn_Swann_6c58.html" title="Lynn Swann">Lynn Swann</a>'s 364).</p>

<p>In addition to the important role he played in taking the Bills to four consecutive Super Bowls, Reed is remembered particularly for his contributions to the Bills' extraordinary <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_3.html" title="January 3">January 3</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a> playoff victory over the <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennessee_Titans_ab07.html" title="Tennessee Titans">Houston Oilers</a>, a game that has come to be known simply as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Comeback_%28American_football%29_a393.html" title="The Comeback (American football)">"The Comeback"</a>. In the game, which Houston led decisively 35-3 during the third quarter, Reed caught three touchdowns in the second half to lead the Bills to the largest comeback in NFL history. Contributing substantially to "The Comeback," Reed finished the game with 8 receptions for 136 yards and 3 touchdowns. The game has been enshrined in NFL history as one of the greatest games ever played. It also is recognized as one the largest comebacks by any team in the history of all of American professional sports.</p>
<p>Following the Bills' victory against the Oilers, Reed went on to catch 8 passes for 152 yards in the Bills' 52-17 <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Bowl_XXVII_0acd.html" title="Super Bowl XXVII">Super Bowl XXVII</a> loss, on January 31, 1993, to the <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas_Cowboys_c876.html" title="Dallas Cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andre_Reed_cb6b.html" title="Edit section: Likely NFL Hall of Fame induction">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Likely NFL Hall of Fame induction</span></h2>
<p>Reed became eligible for induction into the NFL's Pro Football Hall of Fame, the highest honor afforded a former NFL player, in 2006, but was not selected for induction in either of his first two years of eligibility (2006 and 2007), due in part to the logjam of accomplished wide receiver candidates. In February 2007, Reed was passed over for selection in favor of former <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas_Cowboys_c876.html" title="Dallas Cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a> receiver <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Irvin_25ae.html" title="Michael Irvin">Michael Irvin</a>, despite the fact that Reed's overall receiving statistics surpass Irvin's in nearly ever category, though Irvin's career ended prematurely with a spinal injury.</p>
<p>Most analysts believe Reed's extraordinary receiving statistics, along with the role he played in taking the Bills to four consecutive Super Bowls, will ultimately win him Hall of Fame selection. Most of Reed's NFL receptions were thrown by former Bills quarterback <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Kelly_3baf.html" title="Jim Kelly">Jim Kelly</a>, who was inducted into the Hall in 2002.</p>
<p>In 2006, Reed was voted into the Buffalo Bills Wall of Fame, joining less than a dozen players in Bills history to have his name enshrined in the field-encircling cement of Buffalo's Rich Stadium.</p>
