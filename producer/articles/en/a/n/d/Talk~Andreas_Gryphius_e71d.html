<p>Dear 71.159.31.82, you write in the edit summary: "Space Cadet, you persistently declare people Polish, who are clearly not. Do you think you have the right to do that&#160;? Are you a higher authority than emperors or popes or United Nations?"<br />
When, where and how am I doing what you accuse me of. My edit:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Andreas_Gryphius&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95483150" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Andreas_Gryphius&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95483150" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. As you can see I am NOT changing the guy's nationality from German to Polish, in the lead I use "Danzig" first and "Gdańsk" in parentheses, in further paragraphs I'm not using "Gdańsk" at all! Mainly because it is unquestionable to me that Gryphius was German!<br />
I only change the factual (yes!) but completely misleading: "<a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanse.html" title="Hanse">Hanse</a> city of <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danzig.html" title="Danzig">Danzig</a> (since 1945 <a href="../../../g/d/a/Gda%C5%84sk.html" title="Gdańsk">Gdańsk</a>), <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a>)" with much clear and more representative of the historical reality: "<a href="../../../d/a/n/Danzig.html" title="Danzig">Danzig</a> (<a href="../../../g/d/a/Gda%C5%84sk.html" title="Gdańsk">Gdańsk</a>) in <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a>".<br />
1) During life of Anreas Gryphius Gdańsk was a an integral part of Poland just like it was during the time of its foundation and just like it is today. I'm sure you're aware of that.<br />
2) Replacing "Poland" with "Hanse" is not just misleading, but dangerously close to the book definition of "incorrect". In 17 century Hanse had no longer any little importance or meaning in the world (unlike Poland). People from all over Europe have been immigrating to Poland for 300 years, not for its Hanse cites (they had plenty of Hanse cities in the countries of their origin) but for the freedom and liberty that it guaranteed, for incomparably higher standard of living, for privileges - unavailable elsewhere, to escape discrimination, prosecution, religious wars, continous petty feudal conflicts etc. Many Germans were settling in the Polish cities of Lwόw and Wilno, and those cities were never part of Hanse.<br />
Hope to hear from you soon, happy editing, <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpace_Cadet_187d.html" title="User:Space Cadet">Space Cadet</a> 11:29, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Well, dear Space Cadet, it is obvious, that a number of points you wrote, are different from what they actually were. I am not going into all this, timewise. The making everyone and everyplace Polish was not meant for you only. Just a few points, yes the city of <a href="../../../l/w/o/Lwow.html" title="Lwow">Lwow</a>, <a href="../../../l/v/i/Lviv.html" title="Lviv">Lviv</a> , actually known as Lemberg for many centuries, has many Polish records, therefore Polish people lived there, but it also has a large number of <a href="http://www.familysearch.org/Eng/Library/fhlcatalog/supermainframeset.asp?display=titledetails&amp;titleno=1194508&amp;disp=Metrical+books%20%20&amp;columns=*,0,0" class="external text" title="http://www.familysearch.org/Eng/Library/fhlcatalog/supermainframeset.asp?display=titledetails&amp;titleno=1194508&amp;disp=Metrical+books%20%20&amp;columns=*,0,0" rel="nofollow">Ukrainians</a> , matter of fact a whole bunch and all kinds of others.</p>
<p><a href="../../../v/i/l/Vilnius.html" title="Vilnius">Vilnius</a> or Wilna did not have any Polish at all <a href="http://www.familysearch.org/Eng/Library/fhlcatalog/supermainframeset.asp?display=topicdetails&amp;subject=771023&amp;subject_disp=Lithuania%2C+Vilnius+%2D+Church+records&amp;columns=*,0,0" class="external text" title="http://www.familysearch.org/Eng/Library/fhlcatalog/supermainframeset.asp?display=topicdetails&amp;subject=771023&amp;subject_disp=Lithuania%2C+Vilnius+%2D+Church+records&amp;columns=*,0,0" rel="nofollow">Vilnius records</a>, only Russian language and German language records, but in the Polish Russian war after 1920 it was conquered by Poland and apparently only then did a number of Polish people come to Wilna. Now Vilnius, Lithuania has a large group of ethnic Polish Lithuanians. What are they, in your estimation, Polish or Lithuanian? Vilnius was also the reason, that Lithuania sought help from Germany in 1939 against Poland (big mighty militaristic Poland, who had won against Soviet Union) and on their own will Lithuania gave back the German Eastprussian Memelland for that, because the great majority of <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memelland.html" title="Memelland">Memelland</a> <a href="../../../e/a/s/East-Prussia_afad.html" title="East-Prussia">East-Prussians</a> had voted against staying with Lithuania anyway.</p>
<p>Just one point to the <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanse.html" title="Hanse">Hanse</a>, first of all the <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanse.html" title="Hanse">Hanse</a> language was Low German, the last official meetings were in <a href="../../../1/6/6/1669.html" title="1669">1669</a>, where <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danzig.html" title="Danzig">Danzig</a> took part and the Hanse cities were never disbanded. Matter of fact there are a number of modern Hanse cities again.</p>
<p>Prost! Happy Holidays to you and everyone! Labbas 21 December 2006</p>
<hr />
<p>Hi, Labbas! How are you?<br />
Gosh, darn, you opened so many new minor issues without addressing the old major ones (but I still assume you're motivated by good faith). First of all I would like you to either take back your accusation stating that I supposedly "persistently declare people Polish, who are clearly not", or at least make a comment to my response. Don't just ignore my answer. (On the lighter side of things: YOU persistently declare language used by you on WIKI English, which is clearly not).<br />
Second, why do you consistently favor the expression "<a href="../../../d/a/n/Danzig.html" title="Danzig">Danzig</a> (since 1945 <a href="../../../g/d/a/Gda%C5%84sk.html" title="Gdańsk">Gdańsk</a>), <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a>)" over "<a href="../../../d/a/n/Danzig.html" title="Danzig">Danzig</a> (<a href="../../../g/d/a/Gda%C5%84sk.html" title="Gdańsk">Gdańsk</a>) in <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a>", especially for the periods of time when the city was an integral part of the Polish state? I realize that both statements are factually true, it's just that your version can easily be misinterpreted into saying that <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danzig.html" title="Danzig">Danzig</a> was never in <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a> and never called <a href="../../../g/d/a/Gda%C5%84sk.html" title="Gdańsk">Gdańsk</a> prior to 1945, which, of course, is nonsense.<br />
Thirdly, I realize that there are Hanse cities today. But isn't their membership more symbolical, than anything else? Kinda like in 17th and 18th centuries? Correct me if I'm wrong about this.<br />
Now for the petty stuff:<br />
Vilnius:<br />
Your own link that you provided clearly states and I quote "Languages used: German, Latin, <b>Polish</b>, Russian". Did you miss that? I mean it kinda contradicts your entire point, which brings us to the next issue: what is your point here, really? Lithuanian language is not mentioned, either. Does that mean that Vilnius was never Lithuanian before 1939? Another absurd. What are those records supposed to prove and how? Does the use of Latin indicate that Poland was a part of the Roman Empire (not HRE, the original one)? Does the lack of Polish language in the records really indicate that it began to develop in 16th century and that Polish names for cities, settlements and other geographical features did not exist prior to that time? Can we get a linguist's opinion on this one?<br />
And I hope you're joking (which is fine, a little humor never killed anyone, I hope) when you say: "after 1920 it was conquered by Poland and apparently only then did a number of Polish people come to Wilna". It's like saying that "only after the Second Partition of Poland did a number of German people come to Danzig". But if you were serious, then could you please investigate the ethnic make up of the entire Vilnius region in the course of history starting with, let's say, 16th century, and get back to me.<br />
Now for L'viv it's kinda different: Although the city itself had been inhabited by Polish majority (at least 90%) for centuries before 1945, the majority of neighboring villages and settlments were purely Ukrainian. What do you mean "actually known as Lemberg for many centuries"? It was a part of the Austrian Empire for less than 150 years and that is hardly "many centuries". Unless you mean "known in <b>Germany</b> as Lemberg for many centuries". Well, <i>Germany has been</i> "actually known" as <i>Niemcy</i> and <i>Italy</i> has been "actually known" as <i>Włochy</i> in Poland for many centuries, but so what? Why is it worth mentioning? What are you trying to say?<br />
Finally, what's up with the sarcasm about "big mighty militaristic Poland, who had won against Soviet Union"? I know that at the time Poland was neither big nor mighty nor militaristic, why the need to rub it in? Everybody knows that and everybody knows that the victory in this war (into which Poland was provoked and drawn) was a lucky (for Poland) and unexpected turn of events. I also know that Poland has hardly been mighty and militaristic since after 1700. So what, though? What's the point here?<br />
Take your time answering, because I will probably be away from WIKI till the second week of January. Happy Holidays! <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpace_Cadet_187d.html" title="User:Space Cadet">Space Cadet</a> 10:49, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<pre>
P.S. I <b>DO</b> know that "kinda" and "though" are improper but I kinda like them, though.

<hr />
<p>Space Cadet- Happy Holidays to you too. Just a little something along the way: The Seal of the City Council of Lemberg (Llow, <a href="../../../l/v/i/Lviv.html" title="Lviv">Lviv</a>) in the XIV Century states: S:CIVITATIS:LEMBVRGENSIS and here is some description of the early history:<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09144a.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09144a.htm" rel="nofollow">Lemberg</a> was taken by <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casimir_III_cebb.html" title="Casimir III">Casimir III</a> and given Magdeburg city rights and many Germans moved there. Only under Jadwiga Jagiellon did it come to be part of Poland. So your info about Lemberg and Habsburg in the 18th century, or only 150 years is off quite a bit. It was not the 18th century but the 14th. As usual, you do not check on earlier history and only assume. Though that bit of factual history might enlighten you in your family history as well as make you think a bit more, when you make your many onesided assumptions. Best wishes Labbas 22 December 2006</p>
<hr />
<p>Hi, Labbas, As always you very superficially address the least important issue instead of the major ones and once again you avoid commenting my answers, clarifications, explanations and attempts to educate you on matters you don't seem to have an inkling about. First a few factual corrections to "enlighten you" (if only you investigated some "earlier history" without making quick unsubstantiated assumptions, you would have avoided coming up with your usual absurd, nonsensical conclusions):<br />
Lwów was located not according to Magdeburg Law but the Środa Śląska (later Neumarkt) Law. Of course the latter one was a derivative of the first one, but there were some substantial differences.<br />
Casimir III did not invite Germans, but German Jews, fleeing constant pogroms, discriminations, persecutions, humiliation and treatment as subhumans, which they were experiencing in the German lands.<br />
Although Poland was for a while in personal union with Hungary, it remained an independent state with separate laws, administration etc., so Lwów remained a Polish city known as Lwów until 1772, after which, like I said, was known as Lemberg for less than 150 years<br />
The wide spread use of one language (be it German, Latin, Polish, scientific convention, technical jargon etc.) in various types of documentation does not at all necessitate those terms to "be known" in any way you want to misinterpret it.<br />
The once "official" Latin name for Warsaw was Varsovia, but it was not "known" as Varsovia but Warszawa in Poland, Warschau in Germany and so on.<br />
OK, enough about correcting your unsubstantiated and false claims, completely unrelated to the main subject, intended by you as a diversion to avoid apologizing to me for your ridiculous accusations suggesting that I "persistently declare people Polish, who are clearly not" and to avoid defending your already lost position "about Hanse city "<a href="../../../d/a/n/Danzig.html" title="Danzig">Danzig</a> (since 1945 <a href="../../../g/d/a/Gda%C5%84sk.html" title="Gdańsk">Gdańsk</a>), <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a>)". I have already lost my conviction about you being motivated by good will. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpace_Cadet_187d.html" title="User:Space Cadet">Space Cadet</a> 03:16, 23 December 2006 (UTC)<br />
P.S. Prince Charles is not just married into a German family, but comes from an aristocratic family, purely German for many generations. Why don't you call him <b>Prinz Karl</b> in the lead? Or are you just onesidedly and closemindedly biased against Poles and their history? Quid erat demonstrandum.</p>
<hr />
<p>Dear Space Cadet, You wrote 'Take your time answering, because I will probably be away from WIKI till the second week of January'. Therefore I had not answered yet, just wrote a few additional messages. And guess what, after your peculiar remarks, I am not going to either, because of your nonsensicalness. Someone else will have to cure you of making your often unsubstanciated false claims, your unending reversals, and attempt to educate you on matters you don't seem to have an inkling about. For now I am just wishing you a Happy New Year 2007. Labbas 3 January 2007</p>
<hr />
<p>Thank you, Labbas, I love you too! I don't care what your psychiatrist says. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpace_Cadet_187d.html" title="User:Space Cadet">Space Cadet</a> 22:56, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The included map is more physical than political, as we would've said today and also it contains numerous mistakes: most town and place names are misspelled or plain incorrect, Masovia is a separate country, shape of provinces and rivers is all out of whack, etc. So no, I'm not a bit convinced that (despite all modern historians) in AD 1600 there was an independent country called "<i>Prussia</i>", where Gdańsk was located. From 1466 to 1793 Gdańsk was a Polish city, located in Poland, governed by Polish laws and enjoying Polish privileges. It was inhabited by many bilingual ethnic Germans who either left Germany for higher standard of living, or were descendants of such. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpace_Cadet_187d.html" title="User:Space Cadet">Space Cadet</a> 19:28, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
