<p>David MacKenzie Ogilvy (June 23, 1911–July 21, 1999) has been often called 'The Father of Advertising'. In 1975, Time called him “the most sought-after wizard in the advertising industry.” In early 2004, Adweek magazine asked people in the business “Which individuals – alive or dead – made you consider pursuing a career in advertising?” Ogilvy topped the list. And the same result came when students of advertising were surveyed. His best-selling book 'Confessions of an Advertising Man' is Ogilvy's advertising mantra followed these four basic principles. Research – Coming, as he did, from a background in research, he never underestimated its importance in advertising. In fact, in 1952, when he opened his own agency, he billed himself as Research Director. Professional discipline – “I prefer the discipline of knowledge to the chaos of ignorance.” He codified knowledge into slide and film presentations he called Magic Lanterns. He also institued several training programs for young advertising professionals. Creative brilliance - A strong emphasis on the BIG IDEA (always written in ALL CAPS) Results for clients - 'In the modern world of business, it is useless to be a creative, original thinker unless you can also sell what you create.' is one of his more famous quotes, that might be apt here. He was known for a career of expanding the bounds of both creativity and morality. His first ad showed a naked woman, something he later admitted he was ashamed of. He reiterated in his book, "Ogilvy on Advertising," that nudes should be shown only if they serve a functional purpose, not irrelevantly In his book he mentions a series of three ads produced in 1981 by a French advertising agency. The first ad showed a beautiful woman in a bathing suit and the caption said "On September 2, I will take off my top." On September 2nd a second ad showed the same woman wearing only the thong from her bathing suit and the caption said "On September 4, I will take off the bottom." By September 4th the buzz was intense. Every man was eager to see if she would keep her promise. She did. (If you wish to see the three ads they are in (Ogilvy, D 1983&#160;: page 26 - 27). Ogilvy, D. (1983), Ogilvy on Advertising, Ogilvy, D. (1985), Confessions of an Advertising Man Early success of his famous campaigns- the 'Hathaway' shirt, 'Schweppes'- rocked the Madison Avenue. He believed that the best way to get new clients is to do great work for existing clients. And he was right. Success of his early campaigns helped him to get big clients like Rolls-Royce and Shell.</p>

<p><b><a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Walter_Thompson_8a34.html" title="James Walter Thompson">James Walter Thompson</a></b> (1847-1928) was the founder of the <a href="../../../j/w/t/JWT_1d1f.html" title="JWT">JWT</a> advertising agency and a pioneer of many <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advertising.html" title="Advertising">advertising</a> techniques.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/6/1864.html" title="1864">1864</a>, while Thompson was serving in the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marine_Corps_50a5.html" title="Marine Corps">Marine Corps</a>, William James Carlton had started selling advertising space in religious magazines. The agency was called Carlton and Smith although almost nothing is known about the Smith partner. In <a href="../../../1/8/6/1868.html" title="1868">1868</a>, Carlton hired Thompson as a bookkeeper. Eventually Thompson found that soliciting and sales were much more profitable and he became a very effective salesman for the small company. In <a href="../../../1/8/7/1877.html" title="1877">1877</a>, Thompson bought the agency for $500 and renamed it <a href="../../../j/w/t/JWT_1d1f.html" title="JWT">J. Walter Thompson Company</a>. Notably, Thompson paid $800 for the Carlton and Smith furniture in the same transaction.</p>
<p>Realizing that he could sell more space if the company provided the service of developing content for advertisers, Thompson hired writers and artists to form the first known Creative Department in an advertising agency. He is credited as the "father of modern magazine advertising" in the US.</p>
<p>Thompson is responsible for some enduring brand images in popular culture, like the <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_of_Gibraltar_54af.html" title="Rock of Gibraltar">Rock of Gibraltar</a> used for the <a href="../../../p/r/u/Prudential_Financial_c608.html" title="Prudential Financial">Prudential Insurance Company</a>.</p>
