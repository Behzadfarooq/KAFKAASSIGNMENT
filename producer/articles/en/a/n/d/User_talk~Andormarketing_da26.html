<p>Apologies, I am still discovering Wikipedia's protocol.</p>
<p>Having looked at the definition of WP:ORG I would still like to appeal your decision on the following grounds:</p>
<p>Andor Technology plc is a publicly listed company (PLC) listing on the London Stock Exchange in December 2004 (AIM). If you do a Google search on "Andor Technology" there are 63,300 hits, the majority of which are not Andor owned. We have several newspaper articles and TV/radio reports on Andor concerning our achievements as one of UK/Ireland's leading technology innovation companies. PLease refer to Invest NI (local Government body) if you need testimony to this.</p>
<p>In 2005 Andor won Company of the Year in Northern Ireland (run by The Belfast Telegraph). We are also recipient of many awards and accreditations such as Queens Award for Export 2005, ISO 14001: 2004, ISO 9001: 2000, Investors in People 2003 and several awards in Marketing, Innovation and Health and Safety.</p>
<p>In addition to this there are many scientific papers published which credit Andor for supplying cameras used in their research.</p>
<p>I understand Wikipedia's stance on blantant commercialism and advertising, but I do feel very strongly that Andor Technology deserves a place in Wikipedia as an innovative company and a leading light in the current Northern Ireland economy.</p>

<p>All right, in my opinion, you can try to recreate the article, but provide sources for this notability claim&#160;;-).

<p>Thanks for the Heads Up. I do agree on the COI and I am quite happy to rewrite the submission or for someone else to write it, any volunteers?</p>
<p>Anyway here are links to some of this information. NOne of these are "paid for" in terms of advertising or advertorial. I have broken these links into two sections: Corporate overview and academic references to use of Andor cameras. Again I would welcome comment on the suitability of these links.</p>
<p><b>Corporate overview</b> Andor Technology referred to as a Flagship of the Northern Ireland economy. My simple view is that unless one or two more flagships like Andor Technology are established, we will not break through. We can work on the economy in general terms, but it is the champions that make the difference.

OK, I'll stop here for now. Happy to take guidance now. Thanks a lot for your help and advice.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Advice: unless someone volunteers, here's how you can proceed. Create a rewrite and post in a new section below; for each point you make about the company, cite a reference (use the <a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_web_57d4.html" title="Template:Cite web">template:cite web</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_journal_df49.html" title="Template:Cite journal">template:cite journal</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/f/Template%7EReflist_72b2.html" title="Template:Reflist">template:reflist</a>; ask if you don't understand how). Then, I'll be happy to review it and post it for real. That way you stay out of directly editing your own company's article. Then in the future, if you want new stuff added, mention it here. If you need to correct errors, just do it; these are essentially the rules for (auto)biographies. And see my talk page for response to your query there. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDicklyon_1405.html" title="User:Dicklyon">Dicklyon</a> 15:57, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Mark, I don't see the evidence of notability there. None of your references appear to be independent articles about Andor. If I'm wrong, please point out one or more explicitly. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDicklyon_1405.html" title="User:Dicklyon">Dicklyon</a> 18:42, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Dick I have spent a lot of time pulling these references together. The majority of them are not written by us. BBC is an independent news source, as is the Northern Ireland Assembley (a local government white paper), the Queens Award (an international body that is completely independent), the Chartered Institute of Marketing is an international professional body who awards excellence, the London Stock Exchange lists companies completely independently. In fact the rest are from news sources that are independent and we have no control over what they write. The only references to Andor own generated info. is from our web-site.</p>
<p>I have checked out some other companies such as Apple and Roper Industries. I have tried to keep the style of writing similar. How are they more or less notable from the sources they quote. In fact looking at the entry for Sony, the majority of their historical and structural references refer to their own web-site. Is THAT independent?</p>
<p>In terms of the scientific references, the ones I dug out are very technical, taken from papers that reference the fact that their experiments used Andor equipment. They are all included as above, but I did not feel that they were relevant in context.</p>
<p>Looking at the definition of notability again I feel that these references are OK. Maybe you (or someone else) can help here Dick and try and write something independently.</p>
<p>Thanks Mark Andormarketing 21:27, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For notability, I'd like to see multiple articles about Andor; if that's what some of the links you found are, please point them out. A paper that mentions they used your equipment doesn't cut it. A mention in a list of awards or a discussion about the Irish economy doesn't either. Are there any articles about Andor? The fact that you don't see such refs for Apple or Sony should not be taken to mean that they there's any question of the notability of those companies, just that the article is not well referenced. Add a sources tag to ask them to fix it. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDicklyon_1405.html" title="User:Dicklyon">Dicklyon</a> 01:00, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>With articles in Red Herring and Financial Times you can reasonably argue notability; too bad they're not so easy to see online. We can go ahead and make the article, being sure to reference those two and what they say. The others are gravy. Take a look at how to use <a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_web_57d4.html" title="Template:Cite web">template:cite web</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_news_5e9e.html" title="Template:Cite news">template:cite news</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/f/Template%7EReflist_72b2.html" title="Template:Reflist">template:reflist</a>, with ref tags; or ask. Make another cut at the article here, or in a sandbox page, paying more attention to normal style and avoiding advertising, and I'll make the new page if I get a chance. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDicklyon_1405.html" title="User:Dicklyon">Dicklyon</a> 01:02, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK, a few weeks later now, and here's my latest attempt. I would appreciate some help in getting this finally posted, and feel that this is as unbiased and representative of other companies that are listed on Wiki.</p>
