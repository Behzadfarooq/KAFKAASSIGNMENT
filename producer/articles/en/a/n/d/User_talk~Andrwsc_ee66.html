<p>That sounds interesting. I found the project from researching about the templates in <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplates_for_deletion_Log_2007_February_28_fc1d.html#Template:SBAS" title="Wikipedia:Templates for deletion/Log/2007 February 28">this TFD</a> (comment if you like). I like making things into tables, and anything with ParserFunctions, so I might be helpful (also I enjoy intense tedious work during medium-short intervals). I'd love more info, just to see if it's something I'd like (probably would be). By the way, congratulations on adminship&#160;:) <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGracenotes_686d.html" title="User:Gracenotes"><font color="#960">Grace</font><font color="#000">notes</font></a><sup><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGracenotes_98ea.html" title="User talk:Gracenotes"><font color="#960">T</font></a></sup> § 04:51, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for that! I had nominated those templates for deletion.

I've been close to that project for a while, so I may not be able to see the forest for the trees.

<p>Alot of people seem to have different opinions on whether United Kingdom is a country or not. I am one of those who happen to live there and am quite sure that it is not! There are of course arguments for and against but England, Scotland, and Wales stand up to every definition I can think of, while the United Kindgom does not. Apart from definitions, it is general opinion that those three are countries, I believe this has some sway. I do not see any ambiguity in the updated page.</p>

<dl>
<dd>The point is that you made these changes without any discussion or without any edit summary to explain what you were doing, and you also made this sport completely inconsistent with every other Olympic sport. Looking at <a href="../../../f/i/g/Category%7EFigure_skating_competitions_ee38.html" title="Category:Figure skating competitions">Category:Figure skating competitions</a> now, I see your point about having these articles in both a category and a subcategory, so I would support that change <i>if you make the change with a proper edit summary on each article</i>. However, please do not change the category sort key for the year (by "decades"). The common convention is to use the full year (e.g. "2006" and "1908"). <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrwsc_0d9e.html" title="User:Andrwsc">Andrwsc</a> 23:38, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, can you help me with a template please. I have recently created {{<a href="../../../s/t/a/Template%7EState_pageantry_d514.html" title="Template:State pageantry">State pageantry</a>}} and have realized that I need a conditional statement, but I can't figure out how to get it to do what I want. I currently have a wikilink for [[Miss {{{State}}}'s Outstanding Teen]], but I need to use the apostrophe without the "s" (i.e. Arkansas' instead of Arkansas's) when the state ends with an "s" (Arkansas, Illinois, Kansas, Massachusetts, Texas). Is this possible, and if so can you please help me out with this? --<a href="../../../a/f/t/User%7EAfter_Midnight_e273.html" title="User:After Midnight">After Midnight</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/f/t/User_talk%7EAfter_Midnight_381d.html" title="User talk:After Midnight">0001</a></small></sup> 20:36, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know of any way to look at the string and test for a trailing "s", so I put in a conditional based on the existence of the page or not. This works for Arkansas, and for other states that don't have a trailing "s" (e.g. California), but it leaves the wrong redlink if the article does not exist (e.g. those other four states you listed). If you were planning to create all thise articles shortly, then all would work as planned. Please let me know if this is sufficient to solve the problem.

<dd>Well, it certainly needs some cleanup, but I think it is salvageable as a useful article. It doesn't seem to promote any individual company, so I do not think it should be speedy deleted as spam. Just from personal observation, I've seen an increase in mobile billboards in the past few years (especially at trade shows), so my gut feeling is that there is an encyclopedic article that could be written about them, with verifiable sources, etc. I think the current cleanup tag is appropriate for now.

<dd>At the risk of being uncivil, I suggest it is <i>you</i> who has issues - namely, paranoia. Please re-read my comment. I don't know your nationality (and certainly had no idea when I repaired the redlink on your user page), nor did I say anything insulting. What I <i>actually</i> did was use the standard <a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3_a8b4.html" title="ISO 3166-1 alpha-3">ISO 3166-1 alpha-3</a> country code for that nation, replacing a single-use template (<a href="../../../c/o/u/Template%7ECountry_data_FYROM_3e51.html" title="Template:Country data FYROM">Template:Country data FYROM</a>) that you had created solely to support your unlinked vanity user page - clearly an inappropriate use of the template namespace.

<p>Do you have any references that show that any specific Latvian and/or Estonian athletes competed in the 1908 and 1912 Games (as part of the Russian Empire), or did you just make your changes just because those countries were not independent at the time? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrwsc_0d9e.html" title="User:Andrwsc">Andrwsc</a> 22:59, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

Hi!</p>
<p>Those edit were made by me and I probably wasn't logged in. If you look here (<a href="http://users.skynet.be/hermandw/olymp/topsto12.html" class="external free" title="http://users.skynet.be/hermandw/olymp/topsto12.html" rel="nofollow">http://users.skynet.be/hermandw/olymp/topsto12.html</a>) and scroll down to see the participants from Russia, you can see that some of them were from Estonia and Latvia. Those lists are actually incomplete and have some errors. Estonian Olympic commitee lists that 12 Estonians participated at the 1912 Olympics of which Martin Klein won silver and Mihkel Kuusik bronze medal. Latvian Olympic commitee lists 31 athletes that participated at the 1912 Olympics and Harry Blau won a bronze medal. Also Georg Lind, who came 19th at the marathon in 1908 was Estonian.<a href="../../../g/h/_/User%7EGh_cf6c.html" title="User:Gh">Gh</a> 17:17, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ok, perfect! Thanks for the reply. I've seen other instances where editors have been a bit over-zealous in attributing past Olympic appearances. For example, the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Indies_Federation_9f77.html" title="West Indies Federation">West Indies Federation</a> competed as <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_West_Indies_at_the_1960_Summer_Olympics_ec65.html" title="British West Indies at the 1960 Summer Olympics">British West Indies at the 1960 Summer Olympics</a> with athletes from Jamaica and Trinidad &amp; Tobago (only), but I've seen some edits where <i>all</i> the Carribean nations that were part of the brief federation (such as Cayman Islands and Antigua) competing in 1960. I wasn't sure if your edits were like that, or really reflected actual Estonian and Latvian athletes. Someday when we get around to completing Estonia at the Olympics and Latvia at the Olympics, the athletes you mention ought to be included. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrwsc_0d9e.html" title="User:Andrwsc">Andrwsc</a> 17:32, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Of course not. The "editor" is intended specifically for multi-author book with an overseeing editor (we want to ultimately cite as "author" the person who wrote the text being cited).

<p>Hi! Thanks for clearing up multiple Olympic-related pages! I'm curious about the official result list for the women's high jump though.</p>
<p>I understand that the IAAF result lists may not be trustworthy (i.e. DQ for USA in the 4x400 m...). But <a href="http://www2.iaaf.org/OLY00/results/data/W/HJ/Rf.html" class="external text" title="http://www2.iaaf.org/OLY00/results/data/W/HJ/Rf.html" rel="nofollow">it</a> does show the following data:</p>
<pre>
1   Yelesina Yelena           RUS  2.01 (SB)  
2   Storbeck-Cloete Hestrie   RSA  2.01 (SB)  
3   Bergqvist Kajsa           SWE  1.99      
3   Musunoiu-Pantelimon Oana  ROM  1.99 (PB) 
</pre>
<p>And, when examining the height-by-height results, there is no difference between the two athletes whatsoever.</p>
<pre>
<b>Athlete                    185  190  193  196  199  201  203</b> 
Bergqvist Kajsa            o    o    o    o    xo   x-   xx 
Musunoiu-Pantelimon Oana   o    o    o    o    xo   xxx
</pre>
<p>If the above figures are displayed correctly in the IAAF result list, there is no way that anyone could have won or lost on countback.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.iaaf.org/athletes/athlete%3D66089/" class="external text" title="http://www.iaaf.org/athletes/athlete%3D66089/" rel="nofollow">IAAF profile for Oana Pantelimon</a> still shows a third place finish in Sydney 2000 (although that might not be fully reliable. Look, for instance at the preposterous <a href="http://www.iaaf.org/athletes/athlete=208675/BioPopUp.html" class="external text" title="http://www.iaaf.org/athletes/athlete=208675/BioPopUp.html" rel="nofollow">IAAF profile for Stian Andersen</a>).</p>
<p>Could you tell me the url for the official (IOC?) result list? We should compare the two. And by the way let's keep the discussion on this page. <a href="../../../p/u/n/User%7EPunkmorten_c486.html" title="User:Punkmorten">Punkmorten</a> 22:30, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My two primary references for all Olympic-related results are the IOC medal database <a href="http://www.olympic.org/uk/athletes/results/search_r_uk.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.olympic.org/uk/athletes/results/search_r_uk.asp" rel="nofollow">here</a> and the official reports from each Games <a href="http://www.aafla.org/5va/reports_frmst.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.aafla.org/5va/reports_frmst.htm" rel="nofollow">in PDF format here</a>. In the case of the women's high jump in 2000, both of these sources agree with each other that only a single bronze medal was awarded (to Bergqvist), so that's why I made the changes. I have been going through all the Games adding up the per-sport medal counts we have on Wikipedia, comparing to the official totals to find any discrepancies, and this was one I found.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for the 4x400 relay, the IOC database still showed USA with the gold, not NGR, so I googled around to try to see if the IOC database or the IAAF database was more current. I found the references to the CAS ruling that seemed to support the IOC list with USA-NGR-JAM as official, so that's why I made <i>those</i> changes.</dd>

<dd>The Sydney results PDF perfectly matches the IAAF result in terms of each attempt ("x" and "o"), but it also clearly shows Pantelimon as ranked 4th instead of a tie for 3rd. There <i>are</i> tie rankings further down that list at 9th and 11th, so <i>some</i> tie-breaking method had to have been used between Pantelimon and Bergqvist. I have no answer to that, but I still think our best approach is to align with the IOC/SOCOG results as our primary sources. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrwsc_0d9e.html" title="User:Andrwsc">Andrwsc</a> 22:57, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just wanted to let you know I have put some comments on the discussion pages on both <a href="../../../s/k/i/Ski_jumping_at_the_1952_Winter_Olympics_b8c0.html" title="Ski jumping at the 1952 Winter Olympics">Ski jumping at the 1952 Winter Olympics</a> and <a href="../../../s/k/i/Ski_jumping_at_the_1956_Winter_Olympics_86f0.html" title="Ski jumping at the 1956 Winter Olympics">Ski jumping at the 1956 Winter Olympics</a> regarding number of positions shown. The two links for this only show the top six finishes, a practice common in the FIS results until well into the 1970s. Do we want to get biographies on all these athletes who compete? To me, what most people seem to remember at the Winter Olympics are the medalists and maybe up to the top eight or ten finishers. Anything else, IMO, is overkill. You can discuss with me or the article talk page if you prefer. Just a thought. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMiller17CU94_3e8e.html" title="User:Miller17CU94">Chris</a> 02:47, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've also replied on both those talk pages because you asked different questions on them, but to address the one you ask here, here is my personal opinion: I like to see <i>complete results</i> for each Olympic event page. Ignoring for the moment the issues that arise if you pick an arbitrary truncation point, I think there is interesting information to be gleaned from a complete results list. How many athletes participated? From what countries? Perhaps a notable athlete was disqualified and therefore wouldn't show up in a top 6/8/10/whatever list. However, I should also say that while I like to see complete results, that certainly doesn't mean that I believe we need to resolve every single redlink and create articles for every participating athlete! Over 100,000 unique people have competed in any past Games, so it is obviously unreasonable to expect that we have articles on all of them. I think it will be difficult enough to create articles for every <i>medalist</i>, which is not unreasonable. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrwsc_0d9e.html" title="User:Andrwsc">Andrwsc</a> 04:34, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You are correct, I did create them for use on my userpage but they are useful to other Wikipedians. Each represents a geographical region with a distinct identity- especially the two islands of Ibiza and Mallorca. Bearn has a strong cultural identity and even a small separatist movement.

<dd>Hi Parutakupiu! I was planning to do a bit more work before posting a message to the project talk page for feedback, but I'm glad you like the concept so far. I have gone through all the past Games medal tables (per sport) fixing any errors I found, and I built an Excel spreadsheet that automatically creates the wikicode, so it should be easy to create these pages quickly and accurately.

<dd>As far as I can tell, it all seems well thought and structured, especially the countries' Olympic record categorization and distinguished treatment. I think that this will quickly become a guideline ;) I already saw Belgium's examples (and tagged the newly created Winter page, along the way) and the testing seemed very good. Just one question: for those countries which isn't feasible to display the complete medalist table, what is your idea on how to direct viewers to this data?

<dd>Well, for "large history" nations (USA, URS, etc.), I thought that a "notable medalist" list in combination with a link to the appropriate category of athlete articles (e.g. <a href="../../../o/l/y/Category%7EOlympic_medalists_for_the_United_States_c185.html" title="Category:Olympic medalists for the United States">Category:Olympic medalists for the United States</a>) would serve the same purpose. Also, there are certainly multiple links to the per-Games articles (from the infobox and from the medal tables) so that will help too. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrwsc_0d9e.html" title="User:Andrwsc">Andrwsc</a> 03:15, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, great job! I totally agree with everything there! Also, as far as assessment goes, should there be any bias according to the "large" "small" "no medal" "only one season" countries? I definitely think that nations that haven't won medals should be on the mid to low spectrum, but I'm not sure about the others.</dd>

<dd>Thanks! My next step is to update all the individual Games articles to include those numbers in a "Program of events" section, and since I have all those numbers in an Excel spreadsheet, it should be easy to automatically generate the wikicode for that.

<p>The <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_of_Northern_Ireland_3bda.html" title="Flag of Northern Ireland">Flag of Northern Ireland</a> article makes it clear that Northern Ireland dosen't have a legal flag, the Ulster Banner is not a legal flag and hasn't been for 35yrs.--<a href="../../../p/a/d/User%7EPadraig3uk_dbac.html" title="User:Padraig3uk">padraig3uk</a> 20:12, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>But that article also doesn't claim that a greenish blob is the flag. In my opinion, there are two solutions for <a href="../../../u/k/f/Template%7EUKFlags_6904.html" title="Template:UKFlags">Template:UKFlags</a>. One is to put "(1953-1972)" as a caption after the flag image, which is what I have done. This is also fully consistent with the infobox in the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> article. The UKFlags template serves as a <i>navigation box</i>, so anybody who clicks on the wikilink to <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_of_Northern_Ireland_3bda.html" title="Flag of Northern Ireland">Flag of Northern Ireland</a> will get the full story. I believe this is an appropriate NPOV solution. The other acceptable (to me) alternative would be to remove the flag altogether from that template, but I don't like that idea because it will spur editors to put it back in, continuing this seemingly endless edit cycle. I'm certain that there are many people like me who knew about that flag, but not about its legal status until they read Wikipedia articles. That's the desired effect of navigation templates, in my opinion. Therefore, I would rather keep that image in the template, with whatever reasonably short disclaimer is required to satisfy POV problems, and attract people to learn more about it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Of course, putting that green blob in the template (implying that it is an actual flag!) next to the link to the <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_of_Northern_Ireland_3bda.html" title="Flag of Northern Ireland">Flag of Northern Ireland</a> article, is clearly the wrong thing to do. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrwsc_0d9e.html" title="User:Andrwsc">Andrwsc</a> 20:22, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Well I would rather remove the image of the flag from the template completely, it gives the false impression that it is a legal flag by including it.--<a href="../../../p/a/d/User%7EPadraig3uk_dbac.html" title="User:Padraig3uk">padraig3uk</a> 20:28, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think removing it from that template is simply an invitation for other editors to put it back in. Like it or not, that flag is used to represent Northern Ireland in several contexts (for example, next to <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darren_Clarke_f178.html" title="Darren Clarke">Darren Clarke</a>'s name in golf tournament results). Consider it a <i><a href="../../../d/e/_/De_facto.html" title="De facto">de facto</a></i> flag instead of a <i><a href="../../../d/e/_/De_jure.html" title="De jure">de jure</a></i> flag, if you will, but that does not negate the usefulness of keeping that image next to the link to the detailed <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_of_Northern_Ireland_3bda.html" title="Flag of Northern Ireland">Flag of Northern Ireland</a> article in that navigation template. I think we need to find a way to keep it in the template, so I'd like to reach some consensus with you. Is there any caption or other reasonably compact notation we could add to the navigation template that would satisfy any of your POV concerns? Do you not think the "(1953-1972)" label is sufficient? Or, what if we also added a couple of other historical flags with similar captions (such as "<a href="../../../u/n/i/Image%7EUnion_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg_5679.html" class="image" title="Flag of United Kingdom"><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/17/Union_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg/22px-Union_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg.png" alt="Flag of United Kingdom" width="22" height="13" longdesc="../../../u/n/i/Image%7EUnion_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg_5679.html" /></a> (1606-1801) and <a href="../../../s/t/_/Image%7ESt_Patrick%27s_saltire.svg_9d37.html" class="image" title="Flag of Republic of Ireland"><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/2/20/St_Patrick%27s_saltire.svg/22px-St_Patrick%27s_saltire.svg.png" alt="Flag of Republic of Ireland" width="22" height="13" longdesc="../../../s/t/_/Image%7ESt_Patrick%27s_saltire.svg_9d37.html" /></a> (1753-1922)") to the template? That would add weight to the non-current status of the NI flag by providing some additional comparables. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrwsc_0d9e.html" title="User:Andrwsc">Andrwsc</a> 21:01, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your idea of adding other historical flags to the template has some merit, if these are placed in a seperate historical flag group along with the Ulster banner, I regard the use of this flag in a Home Nation section as POV and misleading.--<a href="../../../p/a/d/User%7EPadraig3uk_dbac.html" title="User:Padraig3uk">padraig3uk</a> 21:12, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
