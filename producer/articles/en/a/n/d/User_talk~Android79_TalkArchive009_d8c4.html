<p>Hey, take a look at my talk page and tell me what I should do with this guy. I strongly believe he's being sarcastic and attacked me personally but am assuming good faith now. If wrong I plan on giving him a final warning adn if he comes back to report him as a vandal. Thoughts?Gator1 21:43, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>He WAS going after me and just blanked my vandal warnings. Comments?Gator1 21:55, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Looks like he's gone, I'll let you know. A critique would be most appreciated. Is it considered vandalism when you tell someon not to come back to your talk page and they do with more of the same attacks? He impugned my abilities as an attorney. I take that very seriosuly and consider it a personal attack and a very low blow. But let me know how I should have handled it and if my warnings on his talk page should be put back after being blanked. Thanks.Gator1 22:13, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The entry on homocide as a term denoting the killing of a homosexual was deleted entirely. And there is no "vote for unredirect" system.

<p>I see you have opposed my adminship candidacy on the same grounds as <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan">Andre</a>. Do you believe I have a sense of ignorance, and if so, how can I fix that? If I read up on someone else who is running for adminhood, and see initial evidence of misconduct without thoroughly evaluating that evidence, should I just not render a vote at all? <span style="border: 2px solid #ba0000;">&#160;<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenelson83_2b5d.html" title="User:Denelson83">Denelson</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenelson83_28f5.html" title="User talk:Denelson83"><b>83</b></a>&#160;</span> 20:02, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>If you see initial evidence of misconduct without thoroughly evaluating it, I'd suggest you not vote at all until you <i>can</i> thoroughly evaluate it, or just bring it up in the comments section for others to look at. If you had done that instead, it would have been a constructive discussion of that particular incident (hopefully). By basing your vote on one out-of-context example of perceived incivility (incivility that I personally see on DreamGuy's side) you are not really making a strong case for opposition. An oppose vote ought to be based on a reasonably long history of misconduct, not one set of comments, <i>especially</i> when there is so much evidence of Friday's civility and constructive cooperation with other users. One incident doesn't make or break one's reputation. This is all, of course, just my opinion. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="green">android</font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="purple">79</font></a> 23:22, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi, you speedy deleted STILL REFUSES TO SAY SORRY as an "attack page". Can I point out that the speedy criterion A6 applies to "<b>short</b> articles that serve no purpose but to disparage their subject", and the example given is "OMFG! Joe Random is a l0ser n00bface lolol!!!11").". The article in question was a long paragraph of coherent text, and included various verifiable statements of fact about a prominent politician. I do not believe it fit the criteria, and I do not believe it is appropriate to speedy delete articles of this nature. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 01:19, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you don't mind an outsider opinion, I admire the speedy undeletion, since there was protest. However, I feel the original speedy deletion was valid. Discounting one anon, there's unanimous consent for deletion, including a few suggestions of speedying it as an attack page. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 01:38, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks, Friday. I guess I could have called it "short enough" to qualify for A6, especially given the way the dicussion was going at the time. It's all academic at this point, anyway – if Kappa votes merge or keep, I don't think it'd be a bad bet to say he'll be the only one – and I refuse to get all bent out of shape about speedies and undeletions. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="green">android</font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="purple">79</font></a> 01:50, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Android79 thanks for the undeletiong but I'm disappointed that you would wish to stretch the speddy criteria in a way that they really weren't intended to be. You are correct that it's academic, I wasn't asking for it to be undeleted, just for you to be more restrained in future. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 01:56, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It wasn't my wish to "stretch" anything. The word <i>short</i> in A6 had apparently escaped my attention until now, and I thought I was validly applying it without having to do any justification. I'm going to take any questioning of my speedies as an implicit undeletion request, unless the reasoning is absolutely absurd. There's been far too much acrimony about this kind of dispute recently, so back to AfD it goes. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="green">android</font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="purple">79</font></a> 02:05, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You were the final decision maker on the speedy deletion of my New_Yanoff (Usenet Client) entry.</p>
<p>The identified "copyrighted" page listed contains text that *I* wrote about my own software. I think the text is concise, that's why I use it most everywhere (including my own product web page). I don't know how much editing would be necessary to avoid triggering the copyright search match, but that shouldn't be necessary anyway because, as I said, I wrote both texts. Is there some tag I can add to note that I have permission to include "copyrighted" material (which I do have)? The help text on wikepedia indicates this is possible but nowhere do I find details/spec on how to do this!</p>

<p>Just FYI, the reason I want the trivia section is related to my current combing the article. I need a place for some facts that are sufficiently relevant to be mentioned, but don't really have a good home of their own.

<li>Yeah, I understand your perspective there. My personal reasoning is that if trivia doesn't really fit in the body of the article, it's not sufficiently important to be mentioned even in its own section.

<p>Thanks for your support there, if you are able to, i'd welcome your help in trying to make Pigs into a better user.

<p>Please see my latest post on ANI. I wasn't saying a plot was imminent, its just that some admins are not what you might think, and they dont have the best interests of Wikipedia at heart. As you know, most computer geek types are pretty smart, and learned from the "rogue" admin controversies in the past and are now much more subtle in their disruption and flaunting of consensus. And as far as I know this attack is still in the planning stages. I'm not part of it. There is also discussion of running for Arbcom. Arbcom can be controlled by a minority of 4 voters.<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiphilosopher_a3eb.html" title="User:Wikiphilosopher">Wikiphilosopher</a> 14:01, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think there's been some good headway dealing with the Scottfisher copyvio issues. Scott has come up with a list of images that he agrees should be deleted, and both he and Pigsonthewings are asking me to go ahead and delete them. However, I'm not entirely familiar with procedure on PUI and how that relates to the new speedies, so I wanted to ask some other admins familiar with the issue for comment.
