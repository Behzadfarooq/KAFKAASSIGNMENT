<p>Thanks for uploading Image:Astrasnow.jpg. Wikipedia gets thousands of images uploaded every day, and in order to verify that the images can be legally used on Wikipedia, the source and copyright status must be indicated. Images need to have an <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">image tag</a> applied to the <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_description_page_4215.html" title="Wikipedia:Image description page">image description page</a> indicating the copyright status of the image. This uniform and easy-to-understand method of indicating the license status allows potential re-users of the images to know what they are allowed to do with the images.</p>

<p>Hi, thanks for uploading some images of European cars, many which are potentially useful. However, please be careful not to simply replace images taken by other users with your own images unless they are replacing a fair-use image. Many of your car images have incorrect copyright tags on them (software screenshot tags, etc) which will possibly end up being deleted at some point, which will leave these pages without any image at all of that particular car. In particular, I suspect the <a href="../../../a/s/t/Aston_Martin_Vanquish_982c.html" title="Aston Martin Vanquish">Aston Martin Vanquish</a> has an incorrect tag. Don't let this put you off though, but please be careful about replacing GNU released images with Fairuse ones. Thanks! <b><a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBob_Castle_6920.html" title="User:Bob Castle">Bob</a></b> <small><b><a href="../../../b/o/b/User_talk%7EBob_Castle_7101.html" title="User talk:Bob Castle">talk</a></b></small> 20:43, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
