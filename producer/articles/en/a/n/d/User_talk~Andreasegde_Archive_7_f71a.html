<p>I never really listened to this song before, but it is so [expletive <i>elated</i>] brilliant, that I urge you to listen the fantastic drum track and the pertinent lyrics. The video shows some early Fabs stuff that I have never seen before, BTW. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whHvXovWXSQ" class="external text" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whHvXovWXSQ" rel="nofollow">Tomorrow Never Knows</a> <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasegde_c4ec.html" title="User:Andreasegde">andreasegde</a> 21:19, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>That's a great video -- it's great the way they make the film bounce to the rhythm -- or maybe los Fabulosos actually did the song at the Cavern in 1962. Har! McTavidge 00:24, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is a serious problem on the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Epstein_c309.html" title="Brian Epstein">Brian Epstein</a> page that needs to be looked at by other editors. I politely request other editors to take a look at the article and the talk page to decide whether the article is defamatory to Epstein, and whether there is too much in it about his sexuality. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasegde_c4ec.html" title="User:Andreasegde">andreasegde</a> 18:16, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The article can only be defamatory if it isn't cited - if it's cited to reliable sources it's fine. The "Popular culture" section in the article will need a cleanup first before it can reach GA though. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuciferMorgan_f0d2.html" title="User:LuciferMorgan">LuciferMorgan</a> 20:35, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think it is fine as regards comments made about his business dealings, since most seem to be cited, and his percentages. As for some of his business dealings, perhaps he wasn't quite as smart as he could have been and trusted people too much but he was singularly devoted to the band, and again there are references (and qualifications about general practice at the time).</dd>
<dd>As for his sexuality, it seems that it did inform much of his life and as being <i>queer</i> was illegal and socially unacceptable in his formative years it must have played a significant part of his character development. Other than his sexuality and dealings with the Beatles, and other acts, is there any decent sources for the rest of his life outside of the Beatles and his orientation? I wouldn't be surprised if there was precious little outside of the Beatles and being gay. <a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 21:22, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suggest a good long hot soak in a bath with the partner of your choice (preferably with someone whom you are in love with). It always helps me, and it could be good for you as well.

<dd>In response to this, as well as the comment you made to someone else below it (both now in your archives), I apologize if my comments made you think I was "looking for an argument". I was not, unless you consider any discussion in which there may be opposing viewpoints an argument. My comment reproduced above was simply a response to your comments (which you subsequently removed from the Wikiproject page), that accused me of trying to stifle any response to my own comment on that page, with you thinking that I had "closed" that discussion. I noted that it was kingboyk who "closed" the discussion, <i>an action which I felt the same about him doing as you felt about my supposed doing</i>. It's quite unfortunate that a completely innocent comment (which I admit came off somewhat acerbic, but which was not intended to do anything but state my view on the Beatles Miscellanea article) can result in two excellent editors (yourself and kingboyk) misunderstanding my intent completely.</dd>

<dd>While you told me not to answer your question about why I'm here, I will anyway. I'm here to improve Wikipedia just as you are. I generally do simple edits, not having a whole lot of time to devote to the kind of in-depth work on articles that you're doing. I've also created a view SVG flags for articles (mostly on commons, not en.wiki), started a few articles, and occasionally do an administrative task or two.</dd>

<dd>Uhh-err missus, I did (but in sausage-land.) I played your video to me bird today, and she spotted you straight away. Why was it the last "gig" anyway? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasegde_c4ec.html" title="User:Andreasegde">andreasegde</a> 21:47, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How would your gf recognise me? I've never even met her..... honest. The "final gig" relates to a three-year long story of us being a band in name only. When I met John in the 1st year of Uni we both had that mentality of wanting to be in a band. At the time we lived with a lad who played bass and we'd always talk about forming a band, but it was really hard work. Then I pointed out that the best parts of being in a band - thinking up a name, jamming, telling people you're in a band, using it to impress girls - didn't actually involve much work at all. So we thought up a name - The Troubadours - and just played old Oasis tracks and "What's Gonig On" sometimes, but we really enjoyed it. Like "The Best There Isn't, The Best There Wasn't and The Best There Never Will Be". The bass player wasn't really involved because he has stage fright (we'd spend ages thinking up ideas to remedy this should we ever actually gig - for example having him inside a cupboard on stage). Anyway, Two years we lived together and it was a running joke. This year we don't live together, and though we see each other all the time we never jam. Went round his the other day for his Birthday and we just started, someone said we should record it, so we did and said it'd be our last gig coz we leave uni the end of this year. Turns out it was really good, I like it.</dd>

<dd>He does have a point though, I didn't much care for The Beatles until someone came up to me and said "The Beatles are really popular". Since then, I've been their #1 fan. I don't understand what any of the words mean, but I don't think that matters because they're very popular. I also feel a band some 50 years old could, quite accurately, be described as "modern"</dd>

Don't come bitching people about them because - get this - no one gives a shiny shite what you think. Maybe it's because you're not popular so I don't have any sheep-like desire to follow you.

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, my esteemed colleague has just had a rant, which is totally allowed on this page (which is mine but not mine, as the powers that be know all too well). The honourable Crestville is a fine, upstanding young man (when he's not falling into walls whilst under the influence) and I am quite possibly related to him in a northern, alcoholic way (the DNA pints have yet to be pulled). If anyone disagrees with his personal thoughts and complains about them, I will politely rip off your ears and speak with your testicles (in a very moderated, and calm way, you undrerstand) about sharpened scissors and the use thereof. Scissors are also very pointy, which makes any member of the male species grimace when thinking about them. Now block us both, or give us a Barnstar for licking the road clean with our lacerated tongues every morning. There you go - I think that will do... <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasegde_c4ec.html" title="User:Andreasegde">andreasegde</a> 18:51, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That he tried to insult us by insulting the Queen and Prince Charles sort of shows how out of touch he is with British culture. If you want to fuck the Queen, be my guest. What I did find annoying was the accusation that English people don't use the English language correctly. Well, aside from the argument that there is no single defining "English Language" due to regional variencies, I would add that since the language is English, however the English choose to speak it is right beause it's our language. By the same token, if nyone ever beats us at rugby, football etc. it's not because they're better than us, it's because they're not playing it properly. It's a strange logic, but I think it works. By the way, vandalise my page as much as you like. I'll just revert it, no worries.--<a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECrestville_26d9.html" title="User:Crestville">Crestville</a> 14:57, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As a <i>smaller number of people</i> who believe this to be the case, myself, Vera Chuck and Dave, Crestville, and one or two others (who have been around Wikpedia long enough to know what we are talking about) have decided that the policy will be changed. We have not voted on this, and realise that many editors will disagree, but we have come to a consensus that we believe is best for Wikipedia and articles that feature The Beatles (as a group, and not as individual members in groups of two or three) and agree that when editors write about 1/2/ or 3 of The Beatles, they should called <b>the Beatles</b>, but collectively, <b>The Beatles</b>, as that was the band's name.

<p>I've left the Beatles project. I can't understand half of your talk page posts so I don't know if any of the comments about cliffs and cats and pigeons and other ... stuff ... should mean something to me, but it doesn't. It could be about me for all I know (or care). I'll <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. I do sincerely hope that you will reconsider your approach to this. Your confusing talk page posts aside, I think before you went all psycho on the/The, you were trying to move articles up the assessment scale and that was good. This bizarre "I am in charge now" thing is so opposite of that that I can't comprehend it. And somehow, you were adding reasonable citations to article pages, but doing OR for the/The. StopAndThinkAboutIt. The issue <i>now</i> is not the/The. The issue is process. I will let you have the last words. And, by the way, I can use confusing in-jokes and self-referential confusing claptrap as much as the next guy; I just don't choose to do it here. — <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Cardinal_6b2b.html" title="User:John Cardinal">John Cardinal</a> 04:48, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't get it -- why are you so sarcastic and in-your-face? ("If anybody actually read through ... they might get the point..." blah, blah.) I suspect everybody who's commented actually did read through it all, even those of us who are headless poultry now, and even got the point, such as it is. I just don't see any support for it outside of your own musings on it. As someone pointed out earlier, you're basically just repeating your opinions over and over -- and getting pissed off (I know, stupid American, I've stumbled here and accused you of getting drunk when what I meant to say was that you got angry) at the drop of a hat, shouting at innocent bystanders with all caps (recall "AND WHO ARE YOU"), and dismissing legitimate (or at least heart-felt) observations/criticisms with throw-aways like "I suggest a warm bath." It's a pretty caustic environment and it's turning people off to an otherwise cool project. McTavidge 03:53, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Let me point out that Andreasegde has got a few GAs for the Beatles Project, and to be honest, I see little other activity outside of his GA contributions. In other words, I don't see anyone else in the Project actually getting off their ass to improve articles which is the whole point of this Project. What's most stupid is people are more concerned about arguing over whether the Beatles should be capped or not, yet when discussions about improving articles come about nobody batters an eyelid - the priorities of this Project seem all wrong.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, the "throwaway" "I suggest a warm bath" comment you're criticising McTavidge was a lot more temperamental than what I would've said to that user. Whether that user's comments were correct I'm unsure, but what I'm saying is his "throwaway" comment was an attempt to defuse the situation. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuciferMorgan_f0d2.html" title="User:LuciferMorgan">LuciferMorgan</a> 11:39, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I couldn't agree more! The <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_McCartney_c886.html" title="Paul McCartney">Paul McCartney</a> article which Andrea brought up to GA only <i>just</i> failed FA, and that wasn't because "The Beatles" at that time were capitalised in the article, in fact, no one even passed comment. And leaving Andrea out of the equation for a momment, there are only about 5 or 6 people (project members) that make any constructive contributions to The Beatles articles, and now this <b>obsession</b> with <b>the Beatles</b> which in my opinon, for certain people, is just about winning an argument, which has cost the project one very valuable member, and <i>we</i> all know who that is don't <i>we</i>?</dd>

<hr />
<p>out-denting.</p>
<p>First, my comment acknowledged the work andreasegde did on trying to get articles moved up the assessment scale.</p>
<p>Second, getting GAs or better on high-profile articles is only one thing that needs to be done. While he has been doing that, I've made 1000+ edits in the last 30 to 45 days, including completely rewriting many song articles. A quick look at my last 500 adits shows the majority on Beatle-related articles (including a bunch on my talk page which were experiments on the Beatle templates, since removed). My project editing includes some anti-vandalism activity and 45 (or so) places where I have added citations--which iis extremely important in my opinion. That's the work of just one other editor, and there are other people out there. This not the <i>Personal Wikiproject of your-name-here</i>, and no single editor is more important than anyone or everyone else.</p>
<p>Third, I agree with McTavidge that comments like "If anybody actually read through ..." are part of the problem. I <i>did</i> read the dictated policy, and I didn't agree with it or with the process by which it was put in place. Does andreasegde think that the argument is so persuasive that anyone who doesn't agree must not have read it? Why not <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>?</p>
<p>Fourth, I regret my comment above about claptrap, etc., although the part about not understanding cats and pigeons and cliffs stands. I don't know what any of that means. More importantly, I stand behind all my in-public, un-coded criticism of how the andreasegde-led policy change was decided and implemented.</p>

<p>Vera, Chuck and Dave: I don't know whom you're referring to as being obsessed (although, as usual, I have to assume that you mean to include me without actually saying so directly), but in any case your opinion that it's just about winning an argument is odd because, as you may have noticed, there's an argument/discussion afoot, and of course that means there are (at least) two opposing views, with adherents to each view, and each side's adherents are actively arguing, back and forth, to and fro (you get the picture), and if that's what you mean by obsession and a desire to win an argument merely for the sake of winning and alienating (or boring) people along the way, etc., then I don't see how it is that only Little T people can be guilty. If you believe that time spent on this is not constructive (and apparently you do), then why go on displaying signs that in others you identify as "obsession"?

<li>In your face and sarcastic, huh? When you slack-arsed moaning fishwives have brought any article at all from Start/B-class to GA, then you can comment. I didn't "try" to move articles up the scale, I bleeding well did it. Until then you can take your "small t" and shove it as far up your rectum as is humanely possible. If you did as much writing in articles as you do on talk pages, every article about The Beatles would be at least a GA, but they're not, are they? You're just a bunch of [expletive deleted], and you can all [expletive deleted] off. That good enough for you?</li>
