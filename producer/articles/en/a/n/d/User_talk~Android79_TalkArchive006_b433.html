<p>How is it vandalism? I'm halfway through writing a complaint about the article and sending it to the Wiki powers that be. It's already been listed.

<li>There are no such thing as "Wiki powers that be" when it comes to deciding article content. That's decided by consensus of those editing the page, and is generally discussed on the article's talk page. If you really feel that the article is in bad shape, you need to make a case for it <i>on the talk page</i>. Since you appear to have no interest in such a discussion, and have been applying seemingly random tags to the article, this looks like vandalism to me. Prove me wrong and engage in constructive dialog at the talk page. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="green">android</font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="purple">79</font></a> 23:26, August 4, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hello Android79. My name is <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoogie_man_9493.html" title="User:Googie man">Googie Man</a> and one of my passions in life is baseball. Another passion is taking pictures of baseball players and putting them on Wikipedia. This is an issue I've done much research about, and the conclusion that I've reached is that the most effective way for Wikpedia to have pictures of baseball players that are 100% guaranteed not to have copyright issues is for us to upload picturs taken by *fans*. It's purely speculation that the image you used of <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johan_Santana_db17.html" title="Johan Santana">Johan Santana</a> is "fair use". I've spoken personally with various representatives of Major League Baseball, and they were not exactly receptive to Wikpedia using their images. So as I've said, the safest route is for us to use images taken by *fans*. I am an avid baseball fan. I spent a lot of time, effort and personal resources to take these pictures to contribute to Wikpedia. So, when you take down the images I've personally taken and uploaded, you're undoing a lot of time and effort for what is in the best interest of this encyclopedia. Therefore, I am reverting your the Jonah Santana page to what it was before your edits, and will continue to do so in the best interests of Wikpedia. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoogie_man_9493.html" title="User:Googie man">Googie Man</a></p>

<p>As a fan of the book and D.Adams in general I would recommend seeing the film. Visually, its a feast for the eyes, of course it compresses the time frame somewhat. Pretty well acted too. Incidentally I met Adams a few years before he left us for the restaurant at the end of the universe, a very gracious man. He signed my copy of "So Long and Thanks For All the Fish". For free. Too bad hes gone, I miss him. See you 'round the wiki! <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamster_Sandwich_8577.html" title="User:Hamster Sandwich">Hamster Sandwich</a> 05:09, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>You are the same person, so yes, it is a charade to pretend otherwise. It makes no difference if you abandoned the other account, as you – by whatever name you choose for yourself – are currently undergoing an ArbCom. The evidence I added is quite relevant to that proceeding. It should not be removed. If you want to clean your slate, admit your wrongdoing and correct your behavior. You can't simply wish up a new identity for yourself and continue with the same kinds of things that got you in trouble in the first place – though I am heartened by the fact that you're not removing stuff from the evidence page yourself anymore. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="green">android</font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="purple">79</font></a> 12:47, August 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Like any other purported fair use of copyrighted materials, this must be weighed according to the traditional (now statutory) fair use factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>the purpose and character of use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes</li>
<li>the nature of the copyrighted work</li>
<li>the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole</li>
<li>the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work</li>
</ol>
<p>In this case, I assert that 3 of the 4 factors swing heavily in the direction of this being a fair use:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wikipedia is a nonprofit, educational website</li>
<li>there can be little effect on the "market" for the copyrighted work (digital images of baseball players) where anyone can get virtually identical images for free at any time.</li>
<li>these are not abstract creative works (like a <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salvador_Dali_16fc.html" title="Salvador Dali">Salvador Dali</a> painting), which would receive strong protection based on the skill that went into their creation; rather they are photographs which simply show what actual people look like in their actual uniforms, in the most utilitarian arrangement for achieving this purpose.</li>
</ol>
<p>The only factor that would swing against you is the third one, but I would not take that too seriously. First, it is impossible to use substantially less than the entire picture to show what the players look like. Are the pictures cropped, or displayed in a smaller size than you would find them on the website from which they have been copied?</p>
<p>Finally, on a more pratical note, no one is likely to go to the time and expense to sue you (or anyone else) over this use of these photos. It is to the MLB's benefit to have consistent representations of its players on the internet, which ultimately serves to promote their business. Furthermore, you're just a screen-name on the internet, and it would be a pain in the <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donkey.html" title="Donkey">ass</a> for them to track you down to bother with a lawsuit in which they would stand to reap only nominal damages (since you have a good faith fair use defense, they could not revcover anything but their actual demonstrable losses incurred due to the infringement).</p>
<ul>

<li>For the record, I am using the photos as-is, no cropping, no alteration. They're pretty tiny. And these are the photos of players you see <i>everywhere</i> – I don't know if you're a baseball fan, but you'd see these headshots on TV and on the big screen at the stadium whenever a player comes up to bat. They're almost like yearbook photos. That said, though, all this talk of "suing" makes me a little nervous. Thank you so much for the advice. I'm not sure what I'm going to do yet. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="green">android</font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="purple">79</font></a> 03:19, August 10, 2005 (UTC)

<li>No problem - see if you can find out whether the MLB has a policy on the use of those photos, tho. Maybe they have something on their website.

<p>Hello Android79, <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoogie_man_9493.html" title="User:Googie man">Googie Man</a>, here again. Thanks so much for your very thought provoking response. You raise a number of interesting issues, all of which I'd like to address in some form or another. First off, about the info. box, and the Santana picture. What you propose sounds great to me, and is a perfect example of what's great about Wikipedia. Through discussions like this, we put our minds and resources together to ultimately make it a better site. Frankly, I liked your info. box better in terms of presentation. However, I do feel like it lacked some vital information that is of interest to most baseball fans. With the info. box you've used, could you put in some additional information, such as how the player was originally selected, their age, and the usual things you can find on various baseball sites?</p>
<p>The issue with Major League Baseball is rather involved, but I'll try to keep it brief. I spoke with the press departments of 3 teams to be named later, asking if I could get a press pass to their Spring Training games so I could take pictures for Wikipedia. Not only were they uniformly dismissive of this idea, they were also not particularly enthusiastic about Wikipedia having articles about baseball in the first place. One in particular said something to the effect that we should read very carefully the rules of using images of Major League players, especially copyrighted images. The tone of the conversations were not particularly positive, needless to say. I don't think that Major League Baseball is going to sue the Foundation, however you never know about what a freelance photographer may or may not do. Furthermore, I think there is another issue at hand here as well. Using fan images is a great way to encourage Wikipedians to contribute their work in a way that's much more rewarding than using someone else's work entirely. It's a way for fans to express their love for the game in a creative way, and Wikipedia offers a unique forum for this expression of creativity. My ultimate hope is that baseball fans across the country will be going to games, taking photos, then uploading them on Wikipedia. And the best part is that fan pictures for non-commercial use is completely legal. Again, I'd really like to hear what your opinions are about this as well.</p>
<p>As for the baseball players project, you can count me in on this! I completely understand about how baseball (and sports in general) are a greatly neglected topic on Wikipedia, and I've been trying to find, without much success, other Wikipedians who share my enthusiasm for baseball. I think we should make a concerted effort to communicate with each other about ideas, ways to standardize the various baseball pages, etcetera, so we can eventually make baseball as detailed and encyclopedic as other subjects are on Wikipedia.

<p>Hi, I've undone your merge at <a href="../../../m/o/v/Movies_333.html" title="Movies 333">Movies 333</a> - now at <a href="../../../t/r/u/True_Movies_cd8e.html" title="True Movies">True Movies</a>, as it is entirely unconnected to the article you merged it with beyond having an entry on their EPG.

<ul>
<li>Eh, the main reason I mentioned it was that I don't think it should be redirected - theres far less important TV related articles, and True Movies has received quite a bit of media interest due to its extremely high ratings for a freebie channel - its completely free to air, and outranks a number of "premium" movie channels in ratings and what ad revenues they can charge... Thats why I mainly un-redirected it. --<a href="../../../k/i/a/User%7EKiand_8457.html" title="User:Kiand">Kiand</a> 03:25, 11 August 2005 (UTC)

<p>I saw the list of things you wanted to do on your user page. Thought since I had a few minutes I would do some checking for you.

<li>Yes, android, I just noticed in a different debate you pointed that guy to the same instruction page I did. Thank you. Incidentally, since you pointed out an error of my own once during a VfD debate, regarding the Google test, I'll just ask, does Google automatically sort out unique hits? Also, how many hits, in your opinion, is sufficient? I have opinions of my own on that, but I'd like to know what you think. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> 23:50, 11 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Regarding Google – generally, you have to go to "the end of the line" in the search results for Google to tell you about duplicate hits. This can be done by clicking continuously on the next sets of search results or by manipulating the query string directly. As for how useful the Google Test is: unless a search term is going to have a wide Web presence (such as a webcomic or a computer program) then I generally use it as only a secondary indicator of notability. Assigning arbitrary numbers to how many hits is "good enough" is probably not a good idea, and it would depend on the subject matter. One number I <i>do</i> use occasionally is for vanity articles: if a modern-day person manages to garner fewer hits than my own name (about forty) then that person is surely not notable, as I'm nobody special. <tt>:-)</tt> <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="green">android</font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="purple">79</font></a> 01:29, August 12, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi Android - thanks for your response. I'd say that the new info. box *looks* great, but is somewhat lacking in information. Have a look at some of these links and the info. box I've used.

<li>Um, it is not listed on google, Stan Lee has tried many times to get that film banned as he does not feel it fits the Spider-Man mythos he had created. He gave the rights for Jake Billion to make that film 10 years ago and didn't like how it came out. Stan Lee has never spoken of it again. And why do you feel the need to ruin my Vega edit when it was perfectly TRUE information. Obviously you aren't into Street Fighter and thus have no point of reference when regarding what its wide fan base thinks. Yet, somehow the info at the bottom of <a href="../../../z/a/n/Zangief.html" title="Zangief">Zangief</a>'s page has credibility and is allowed to stay? it clearly states him as gay.

<li>Jake Billion? If you're going to make names up, please be more creative. Provide some reliable <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">sources</a> for that or for the Vega thing and I won't object to it. As for <a href="../../../z/a/n/Zangief.html" title="Zangief">Zangief</a>, that's neither here nor there, but his sexuality apparently <i>is</i> in doubt, as described on that article's talk page.

<li>The guys alias is 'Jake Billion', definetly not his real name, but thats what he goes by. The reliable info you describe on the Zangief page consists of "I don't like pretty girls" which is something Zangief would say after he brutally beat down Chun-Li in SF2, which was known to have bad translation. This isn't exactly grounds to call someone 'confirmed gay' as it states in the article. Everyone who plays Street Fighter thinks of Vega as a possible gay, so I put that there. My input had as much credibility as the Zangief article. I'm done with this. Keep on editing though buddy! Butt 23:20, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
