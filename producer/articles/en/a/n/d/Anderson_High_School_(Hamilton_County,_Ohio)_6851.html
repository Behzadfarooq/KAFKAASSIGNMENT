<p>Established in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1929.html" title="1929">1929</a>, Anderson High School has been a leading venue for <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_education.html" title="Public education">public education</a> in the <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cincinnati-Hamilton%2C_OH-KY-IN_Metropolitan_Statistical_Area_85ff.html" title="Cincinnati-Hamilton, OH-KY-IN Metropolitan Statistical Area">Greater Cincinnati</a> area. In the early <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a> the United States <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Education_2dce.html" title="Department of Education">Department of Education</a> awarded Anderson High School its highest "Blue Ribbon" honor, indicating the school as a federally declared school of excellence.</p>
<p>Under the leadership of Michael Hall, Anderson High School saw dramatic improvement from <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a> to <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>. Drug and alcohol abuse saw dramatic drops during his tenure, from 68% of students admitting to regular use of drugs and/or alcohol in a survey conducted in the spring of the 1984-1985 school year, to 14% in the same survey conducted in the spring of 2003.</p>
<p>Also under his tenure, the school's athletic department expanded by 48% in student participation<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>, a brand-new track and state-of-the-art football turf surface were installed at the school, a $800,000 addition was made to the school's Titus Auditorium, and the college-bound graduate rate increased by 15.6%<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>.</p>
<p>Diana Carter succeeded Michael Hall and has continued many traditions set in place by the former principal. She has remained firm on drug policies and, with recent bomb threats, has increased penalities and maintained the strict rules set up by Hall. Carter has also made improvements to many of the areas of the school, including music and drama. Her efforts can be seen by the new stage being installed in the summer of 2006 and new trophy cases being added to the Auditorium Lobby which will display awards received by the music and drama departments. She supports every program in the school, whether it is athletics or music, and sees to it that each receives a balanced and fair amount of what it needs to grow and be competitive with other high schools in the nation.</p>
<p>The school and the district press forward with regular achievement of Ohio State high honors in educational excellence. The school's logo and crest and vision have also seen modification in light of this future-focus initiative.</p>
