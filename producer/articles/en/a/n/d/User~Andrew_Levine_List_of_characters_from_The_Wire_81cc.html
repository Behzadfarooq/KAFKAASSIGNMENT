<p>Raymond Foerster was a Major and unit commander of the Baltimore narcotics division in Season One. When <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Daniel_Phelan" title="List of characters from The Wire">Judge Phelan</a> questioned <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Ervin_Burrell" title="List of characters from The Wire">Deputy Commissioner Burrell</a> about the Barksdale operation, it was Majors Foerster and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#William_A._Rawls" title="List of characters from The Wire">Rawls</a> who faced his subsequent wrath and demands for more information. Foerster's response was to ask his shift lieutenant <a href="../../../c/e/d/Cedric_Daniels_da38.html" title="Cedric Daniels">Cedric Daniels</a> for a report and he then assigned Daniels and his team to the Barksdale detail.</p>
<p>When Daniels' investigation became drawn out and relied upon wiretaps and surveillance, Foerster took the side of Deputy Commissioner Burrell against Daniels when he tried to explain the necessity of this technique to reach the heads of the organization. Foerster's and Burrell's insistence on using buy busts led to the operation that resulted with the shooting of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Shamika_.22Kima.22_Greggs" title="List of characters from The Wire">Det. Greggs</a>. Foerster visited Greggs in the hospital with many other command officers and appeared anxious when trying to find a tape recorder to replay the last transmissions before she was shot.</p>
<p>Foerster was promoted to colonel and took over as commander of the homicide division when Rawls was promoted. He attended Rawls' weekly comstat meetings and worked with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Jay_Landsman" title="List of characters from The Wire">Sgt.

Mello ran briefings for the Western district and maintained a sense of humour, typically dismissing the men with "don't get captured." He accompanied Colvin to comstat meetings. Mello was aware of Colvin's "Hamsterdam" free zone where he allowed drug dealing to go unpunished. Mello was worried, but did not report Colvin's actions to his superiors. Colvin protected Mello following the discovery of Hamsterdam by their superiors and after Colvin's departure, Mello was promoted to Western District Commander.

<p>Major Valchek is <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Roland_.22Prez.22_Prezbylewski" title="List of characters from The Wire">Det. "Prez" Prezbylewski's</a> father-in-law and commander of the South Eastern district. He appeared only briefly in season one, trying to smooth over Prez's drunken blinding of a fourteen-year-old. It was mentioned that Valchek had interceded on Prez's behalf in the past when he fired at his own patrol car.</p>
<p>Valchek was the impetus behind the Sobotka investigation in season two. He also met with Prez to discuss his career progression at the beginning of the season. Valchek was involved in a feud with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Frank_Sobotka" title="List of characters from The Wire">Frank Sobotka</a> over a pair of stained glass windows the two men had donated to a local church. When Sobotka refused to withdraw his window (which was larger and more ornate than Valchek's), Valchek ordered his subordinates to begin harassing Sobotka and his union, putting parking tickets on their cars and pulling them over for breathalyzer tests.</p>
<p>The union responded by stealing Valchek's valuable district surveillance van and shipping it from port to port, sending him photographs from each destination. Prompted by this further embarrassment Valchek grew curious as to how Sobotka's destitute union could afford the expensive window. He discussed the union with a politically connected friend, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Andy_Krawczyk" title="List of characters from The Wire">Andy Krawczyk</a>. Krawczyk told Valchek about Sobotka hiring a lobbyist and making campaign contributions. Valchek smelled the possibility of illegal activity and asked then <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Ervin_Burrell" title="List of characters from The Wire">Deputy Commissioner Burrell</a> for a special unit devoted to investigating Sobotka, with Prez as the lead investigator. Since Valchek was well-connected with City Hall through the first district democrats, Burrell obliged.</p>
<p>When Prez informed Valchek that the unit was not doing its job, he demanded a more serious group from Burrell and requested <a href="../../../c/e/d/Cedric_Daniels_da38.html" title="Cedric Daniels">Cedric Daniels</a> as commander on Prez's recommendation, threatening to derail Burrel's quest to become Commissioner if he did not agree. Burrell obligingly recreated Daniels' task force.</p>
<p>As the investigation progressed, Sobotka ceased to be the primary target, and Valchek grew furious. He confronted Daniels' team publicly, and in the process, was punched by his son-in-law. Furious he disowned Prez and threatened to have him removed from the department, telling Daniels that he told his daughter, Joan, not to marry Prez. However, Daniels convinced Valchek to accept a suspension and a letter of apology to all those present at the time of the incident for Prez to keep his post.</p>
<p>Valchek then involved the FBI in the Sobotka investigation to try to refocus it on Frank Sootka and the union. This prompted a series of raids resulting including Sobotka's arrest. Valchek delighted in personally making the arrest and held Sobotka in the union offices until a press gaggle had assembled outside so that he could publicly humiliate him.<sup id="_ref-DM_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DM" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-SLN_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SLN" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>In season three Valchek attended Burrel's comstat meetings and set up a meeting between the now acting commissioner and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Thomas_.22Tommy.22_Carcetti" title="List of characters from The Wire">councilman Carcetti</a> at Carcetti's request.

<p>Port authority officer who discovers the corpses of thirteen girls in a container on the Baltimore docks. Russell started working as an officer because of the pay and her need to support her children. She was the single mother of two young children. She found the job unchallenging and spent most of her time patrolling the docks and checking shipping manifests. She developed a friendly working relationship with many of the stevedores, including <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Frank_Sobotka" title="List of characters from The Wire">Frank Sobotka</a>.</p>
<p>While on patrol, Russell noticed a container that had a broken customs seal and explored it finding a hidden compartment filled with 13 dead bodies. Initially she was the primary investigator and was quite overwhelmed having never dealt with a homicide before. Officer <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_McNulty_a94e.html" title="Jimmy McNulty">Jimmy McNulty</a> intervened for his own reasons and proved that the homicides occurred in city jurisdiction rather than the port. The case was reassigned to the city homicide unit and Beadie was subsequently detailed to homicide for the duration of the investigation. Initially she shows her lack of experience and street knowledge but in working alongside homicide detectives <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#William_.22Bunk.22_Moreland" title="List of characters from The Wire">William "Bunk" Moreland</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Lester_Freamon" title="List of characters from The Wire">Lester Freamon</a> she develops her latent talent for police work.</p>
<p>Russell was motivated to investigate the deaths of the girls as she felt an empathy for them, particularly once she learned that they were sex trade workers. Her compassion was shared by McNulty and the two also shared a flirtation during the investigation.</p>
<p>Russell taps an old boyfriend named <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Maui" title="List of characters from The Wire">Maui</a> in Frank Sobotka's union to find out more about illegal activity in the port. Although Maui will not become an informant directly his information turns the case towards cloning the ports computers to monitor container traffic.<sup id="_ref-BR_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BR" title="">[12]</a></sup> Russells familiarity with the people and organization of the port proved invaluable to the investigation.</p>
<p>Russell moved into <a href="../../../c/e/d/Cedric_Daniels_da38.html" title="Cedric Daniels">Lt. Daniels'</a> office site while his detail investigated Frank Sobotka as the homicide investigation became intertwined. She fended off an advance from Detective <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Thomas_.22Herc.22_Hauk" title="List of characters from The Wire">"Herc" Hauk</a>. Her home life made it difficult for her to work the long hours necessary for the investigation, but she perservered. She connected with detective <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Shakima_.22Kima.22_Greggs" title="List of characters from The Wire">Kima Greggs</a> when discussing the balance of a mother's responsibilities and the dangers inherent in their work.</p>
<p>However, Russell inadvertently tipped the investigation's hand by having her colleagues in the port authority stop a truck carrying normal goods that Sobotka had sent out to test the waters. She was also responsible for confirming Frank's suspicions that he was being investigated - she had told him she was being transferred to try to convince him the heat generated by the dead girls was fading when in reality she remained detailed. Frank checked her status with unwitting port officers who told him she was still working with the detail.</p>
<p>Despite these mis-steps, Russell gains the respect of the officers in the Sobotka detail. At the end of their investigation when the focus shifted past Sobotka she was entrusted with following <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Spiros_.22Vondas.22_Vondopolous" title="List of characters from The Wire">Vondas</a> to a key meeting with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#.22The_Greek.22" title="List of characters from The Wire">"The Greek"</a>. She displayed some nerves but came through delivering the location of the meeting and a chance photograph of the Greek.</p>
<p>Russell was instrumental in convincing Frank Sobotka to agree to inform on the Greek once a strong case was built against him. Her emotional offer of a deal had Frank ready to give up everything he knew in order to help his family. However, Frank was murdered before he could come in and the Sobotka case was forced to end prematurely. With several arrests made and the murder of the girls solved, Beadie returned to her work at the Port.</p>
<p>McNulty reinitiated his relationship with Russell once he returned to beat police work.</p>

<p>Fitz is a special agent with the FBI and a friend of <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_McNulty_a94e.html" title="Jimmy McNulty">Jimmy McNulty</a>'s who often shares information and equipment with him. Fitz helped to inspire McNulty to use modern electronic surveillance in building a case against the <a href="../../../a/v/o/Avon_Barksdale_e5e8.html" title="Avon Barksdale">Barksdale</a> organization by showing how a confidential informant that he had put him in touch with had given them information that led them to set up video surveillance on a drug production ring. He told McNulty it would be the last major bureau drug investigation in Baltimore because they were shifting resources to counter-terrorism.</p>
<p>Fitz helped McNulty again by giving him some of the FBI's superior recording devices as the ones supplied by the police department were too bulky for undercover work. He warned McNulty that his commander <a href="../../../c/e/d/Cedric_Daniels_da38.html" title="Cedric Daniels">Cedric Daniels</a> had been investigated by the FBI for corruption and they had found an excess of liquid assets. When they handed the case over to Deputy Commissioner <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Ervin_Burrell" title="List of characters from The Wire">Ervin Burrell</a> nothing further came of it.</p>
<p>Fitz also became involved with McNulty's teams case against <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Frank_Sobotka" title="List of characters from The Wire">Frank Sobotka</a>. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Stanislaus_Valchek" title="List of characters from The Wire">Major Valchek</a> called in the FBI when he felt that the case had strayed away from his target - Sobotka. The FBI had a particular interest in corrupt unions. When a leak within the FBI seriously damaged the case Fitz realised what had happened and broke the news to <a href="../../../c/e/d/Cedric_Daniels_da38.html" title="Cedric Daniels">Lieutenant Daniels</a>.</p>
<p>In the third season Fitz supplied the major case unit with photo enhancing technology that they used to check number plates on Barksdale organization vehicles.</p>
<p>Fitz is based on a real FBI agent named Jake Fitzsimmons who collaborated on cases with writer and ex-detective Ed Burns.<sup id="_ref-Target_Commentary_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Target_Commentary" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>

<p>Marla is an aspiring politician and the estranged wife of Lieutenant <a href="../../../c/e/d/Cedric_Daniels_da38.html" title="Cedric Daniels">Cedric Daniels</a>. She always had ambitions for her husband to progress in the police force and his failure to do so contributed to the demise of their relationship.</p>
<p>Cedric seemed likely to receive a promotion until he was assigned to run the controversial Barksdale detail. His commanding officers formed the detail to appease an angry judge and wanted a quick investigation to show good faith. Throughout the first series Marla councilled Cedric to take the case his superiors had demanded but he was pushed to better investigative work by the detectives he commanded.</p>
<p>When Cedric was banished to evidence control after upsetting his superiors with his tenacious investigation of <a href="../../../a/v/o/Avon_Barksdale_e5e8.html" title="Avon Barksdale">Avon Barksdale</a> Marla convinced him to leave the department and become a lawyer.

<p>Clay Davis is a corrupt <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maryland_State_Senate_bf80.html" title="Maryland State Senate">State Senator</a> from Baltimore who puts on a friendly public face even as he takes bribes from numerous sources. In season one, <a href="../../../c/e/d/Cedric_Daniels_da38.html" title="Cedric Daniels">Lieutenant Daniels'</a> <a href="../../../a/v/o/Avon_Barksdale_e5e8.html" title="Avon Barksdale">Barksdale</a> detail discovered $20,000 in the car of Davis' driver, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Damien_.22Day-Day.22_Price" title="List of characters from The Wire">Damien "Day-Day" Price</a>, while in the West Baltimore projects. The unit was very interested in any possible links between the Senator and the Barksdale crew, and <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lester_Freamon_2523.html" title="Lester Freamon">detective Freamon</a> wanted to expand the investigation to include Davis in the wiretaps. But Deputy Police Commissioner <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Ervin_Burrell" title="List of characters from The Wire">Ervin Burrell</a> was adamant that the investigation end quickly and that the focus remain on the drug dealers. Burrell called Daniels into a closed-door meeting with the Senator, hoping to get his cooperation, but was unable to persuade him to drop the case. However, Burrell pulled the plug on Daniels' investigation as soon as he could, and Clay Davis' involvement went uninvestigated.</p>
<p>In season two, Davis was seen at a <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29_2333.html" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democratic</a> fundraiser attended by <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stevedore.html" title="Stevedore">stevedore</a> union leader <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Frank_Sobotka" title="List of characters from The Wire">Frank Sobotka</a>. Davis accepted contributions from the union in return for assurances that he would vote for constructing the granary pier that Sobotka believed would revive activity at the shipyard. However, at season's end, with the union in ruins, Sen. Davis was seen with a shovel at a groundbreaking ceremony for dockside condominiums where Frank had wanted the granary.</p>
<p>The third season revisited the Davis-Barksdale connections hinted at in season one. The viewers learned that Senator Davis had been acting as a political consultant for <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stringer_Bell_8a79.html" title="Stringer Bell">Stringer Bell</a>, taking bribes from the Barksdale crew to influence political currents and win state government contracts for the drug empire's legitimate business front, B&amp;B. However, building regulations continued to frustrate the development of Bell's real estate purchases, and when he read in the paper that <a href="../../../b/l/o/Block_grant.html" title="Block grant">block grants</a> were given to several city developpers but not B&amp;B, he became suspicious. Bell described the matter to his lawyer <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Maurice_Levy" title="List of characters from The Wire">Maury Levy</a>, who concludes, with a hint of amusement, that Davis had been playing off Stringer's inexperience in legitimate business and had simply been taking the money and doing nothing for it. Stringer, furious, told Avon that he wanted the Senator killed, but Avon warned him that assassinating a public figure would be dangerously out of their league. Stringer accepted that his trust in Davis was foolish.</p>

<p>Judge Phelan is a friend of <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_McNulty_a94e.html" title="Jimmy McNulty">Jimmy McNulty</a>'s who presided over the <a href="../../../d/27/a/D%27Angelo_Barksdale_7446.html" title="D'Angelo Barksdale">D'Angelo Barksdale</a> murder trial. After seeing a witness change her statement in his courtroom he was forced to let Barksdale go free when the jury gave a not guilty verdict. After discussing the case with McNulty he learned that the witness was most likely paid to change her statement and that D'Angelo was part of a much larger drug dealing operation. Phelan took this information to the Police Deputy Commissioner of Operations, <a href="../../../e/r/v/Ervin_Burrell_19c6.html" title="Ervin Burrell">Ervin Burrell</a>, and insisted the police look into it - his intervention was instrumental in setting up the Barksdale detail.</p>
<p>Phelan also helped to sustain the investigation. He leaked information about the murder of another witness from the trial, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#William_Gant" title="List of characters from The Wire">William Gant</a>, to the press which increased interest in the case. McNulty felt that Phelan had gone behind his back and their relationship was soured for a time. When Phelan was removed from the mayor's re-election ticket his passion for the case waned as he realised his actions had cost him political capital.</p>
<p>Phelan maintains a flirtatious relationship with Assistant States Attourney <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Rhonda_Pearlman" title="List of characters from The Wire">Rhonda Pearlman</a> and admitted to McNulty that he was attracted to her.</p>
<p>Phelan also presided over the trial of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Marquis_.22Bird.22_Hilton" title="List of characters from The Wire">Marquis "Bird" Hilton</a> for the murder of William Gant and was pleased to accept <a href="../../../o/m/a/Omar_Little_33fc.html" title="Omar Little">Omar Little</a>'s testimony and give <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Marquis_.22Bird.22_Hilton" title="List of characters from The Wire">Bird</a> a strict sentence. Phelan ran into political trouble because of his over zealous pursuit of the Barksdale organization and was left off of the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Clarence_Royce" title="List of characters from The Wire">Mayor Royce's</a> ticket for re-election.</p>

Knowing that Tilghman was involved in the prison drug trade, he had <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stringer_Bell_8a79.html" title="Stringer Bell">Stringer Bell</a> follow him to locate his supplier. Bell paid the supplier, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Butchie" title="List of characters from The Wire">Butchie</a>, to give Tilghman tainted heroin. Barksdale lieutenant <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Shaun_.22Shamrock.22_McGinty" title="List of characters from The Wire">Shamrock</a> delivered the heroin and made sure it was passed on to Tilghman. Tilghman smuggled the heroin into the prison by concealing it in sweet packets. Once it was distributed ot the inmates it resulted in the deaths of several prisoners. An investigation was started and Avon came forward and informed on Tilghman's smuggling activity in exchange for an early parole hearing. Stringer gave Shamrock a packet of sweets containing drugs similar to the ones Tilghman used an ordered him to subtley plant it in Tilghman's car. When prison staff searched Tilghman's car they found the sweet packet Shamrock had planted and Tilghman was then arrested.</p>

<p>Levy was the Barksdale crew lawyer and advisor to <a href="../../../a/v/o/Avon_Barksdale_e5e8.html" title="Avon Barksdale">Avon Barksdale</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stringer_Bell_8a79.html" title="Stringer Bell">Stringer Bell</a>. Levy represented Avon's nephew <a href="../../../d/27/a/D%27Angelo_Barksdale_7446.html" title="D'Angelo Barksdale">D'Angelo Barksdale</a> in the "Poo" Blanchard murder trial and successfully returned a not guilty verdict. Levy's case was greatly improved when <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Nakeesha_Lyles" title="List of characters from The Wire">Nakeesha Lyles</a>, a key witness, changed her story and refused to identify Barksdale in court.</p>
<p>Levy was also successful in having charges dropped against young Barksdale dealer <a href="../../../b/o/d/Bodie_Broadus_1278.html" title="Bodie Broadus">Bodie Broadus</a> when representing him in juvenile court. Levy claimed that the work was part of his firms pro bono outreach program to the judge.</p>
<p>Levy also advised Stringer Bell and Avon on how to tie up loose ends when they suspected they were being investigated. His assertion that they should tie up any loose ends particularly those not bound by ties of loyalty to them preceded the deaths of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Nakeesha_Lyles" title="List of characters from The Wire">Nakeesha Lyles</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Little_Man" title="List of characters from The Wire">Little Man</a>.</p>
<p>Levy was instrumental in damage limitation when the Barksdale organization were struck by multiple arrests. He ensured D'Angelo was not kept in police protection so that his mother could reach him and convince him not to testify against Avon. Avon was charged for a minor offence and received a short sentence compared to D'Angelo and soldier <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Roland_.22Wee-Bey.22_Brice" title="List of characters from The Wire">Roland "Wee-Bey" Brice</a>.</p>
<p>When Barksdale was in prison Levy successfully negotiated the bringing forward of his first parole hearing in exchange for information on a corrupt guard and the deaths of several inmates. Although the guard was corrupt Avon had actually set up the deaths to frame him with the reduced sentence as his goal.</p>
<p>Levy was less successful in his defence of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Marquis_.22Bird.22_Hilton" title="List of characters from The Wire">Marquis "Bird" Hilton</a> in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#William_Gant" title="List of characters from The Wire">William Gant</a> murder trial and particularly struggled with the cross examination of <a href="../../../o/m/a/Omar_Little_33fc.html" title="Omar Little">Omar Little</a>. Omar drew paralells between himself and Levy when Levy described him as a parasite feeding off of the Baltimore drug trade and Levy was unable to counter. Bird was sentenced to life imprisonment by <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Daniel_Phelan" title="List of characters from The Wire">Judge Daniel Phelan</a> for the murder.</p>
<p>Levy later advised Stringer on his political contributions. He told him that he had been "rainmade" by <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Clayton_.22Clay.22_Davis" title="List of characters from The Wire">Senator Clayton "Clay" Davis</a> as Davis took contributions without exerting any influence and then took credit for positive results.<sup id="_ref-ML_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ML" title="">[15]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-OCS_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-OCS" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>

<p>Orlando acted as a front operator for the Barksdale crew and ran their strip club, Orlando's. Orlando had ambitions to get involved with the drug dealing aspect of the organizaton but his superiors needed him to keep a clean record for the clubs licencing. He approached <a href="../../../d/27/a/D%27Angelo_Barksdale_7446.html" title="D'Angelo Barksdale">D'Angelo Barksdale</a> to try to involve him in cocaine dealing but D'Angelo refused and eventually told his uncle, <a href="../../../a/v/o/Avon_Barksdale_e5e8.html" title="Avon Barksdale">Avon</a>. Avon punished the wayward frontman with a humiliating beating.</p>
<p>Orlando was later arrested when he tried to buy drugs from an undercover Maryland State Police officer, and agreed to inform on Barksdale for the police. While imprisoned for the charge he was spotted by another inmate loyal to the Barksdale crew who phoned in Orlando's whereabouts.

<p>Shardene was <a href="../../../d/27/a/D%27Angelo_Barksdale_7446.html" title="D'Angelo Barksdale">D'Angelo Barksdale</a>'s girlfriend in season one and a dancer at Orlando's. Their first meeting at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Wendell_.22Orlando.22_Blocker" title="List of characters from The Wire">Orlando's</a> was inauspicious; Shardene asked him to buy her a drink, and he turned her down. Later, she gave an angry customer some of her own money to settle a dispute over his bill. Impressed, D'Angelo asked her out. Shardene and D'Angelo moved in together after seeing each other for a while.</p>
<p>Shardene began co-operating with the Barksdale detail when Dets. <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lester_Freamon_2523.html" title="Lester Freamon">Lester Freamon</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakima__Kima__Greggs_6baa.html" title="Shakima &quot;Kima&quot; Greggs">Shakima "Kima" Greggs</a> showed her the body of Keesha - another dancer from the club. D'Angelo had told her that Keesha had been taken to hospital following an overdose at a party; in reality she had (unbeknownst to him) been raped, wrapped in a carpet, and dumped.</p>
<p>Shardene moved out of D'Angelo's place soon after she agreed to co-operate with the police. Kima and Freamon wired her with a microphone, and she attempted to eavesdrop on Barksdale's conversations at Orlando's, with little success. Frightened, Shardene begged to be allowed to stop, but Freamon persuaded her to help them determine the floorplan of the club so they could install a hidden camera in <a href="../../../a/v/o/Avon_Barksdale_e5e8.html" title="Avon Barksdale">Avon Barksdale's</a> office. The effort was successful, and they managed to catch Avon incriminating himself on video.</p>
<p>Freamon and Shardene grew close during the investigation, and by season two, they were sharing an apartment. She helped put the detectives in touch with some dancers when they were investigating the deaths of girls involved in the sex trade.</p>

When they later plan to meet up, it becomes clear that a trap has been set and Marlo's enforcer Chris shoots and kills a Barksdale crew member and wounds Avon in the process.

<p>Stinkum was a lieutenant and enforcer in the Barksdale crew. He was first seen in the courtroom during <a href="../../../d/27/a/D%27Angelo_Barksdale_7446.html" title="D'Angelo Barksdale">D'Angelo Barksdale</a>'s murder trial. Stinkum was responsible for making re-supplies from the crew's base at the Franklin Towers to their territory in the low-rise projects, known as "the pit".</p>
<p>Stinkum was robbed while delivering a re-supply by legendary stick-up man <a href="../../../o/m/a/Omar_Little_33fc.html" title="Omar Little">Omar Little</a>. He was later involved in the killing of Omar's boyfriend and accomplice <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Brandon" title="List of characters from The Wire">Brandon</a>. Stinkum was identified by a confidential informant <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#.22Bubbles.22" title="List of characters from The Wire">"Bubbles"</a> as an important member of the organization. He was set to be a central piece of the Barksdale detail's case as their investigation progressed. They deciphered the coded communications used to signal him to deliver a re-supply and amassed evidence of him performing the duty. The police seized the resupply from his subordinate <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Kevin_Johnston" title="List of characters from The Wire">Kevin Johnston</a> but allowed Stinkum to go free to avoid arousing suspicion about their surveillance methods.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/v/o/Avon_Barksdale_e5e8.html" title="Avon Barksdale">Avon Barksdale</a> awarded Stinkum the responsibility of taking over new territory and dealing drugs in the territory with a percentage of the profits to go to him. Other Barksdale enforcers organized a party to celebrate Stinkum's promotion. Stinkum was killed by Omar while trying to take a corner controlled by a drug dealer named "Scar," in revenge for the torture and murder of Brandon by Stinkum and associates. Stinkum's murder undermined the case the detail had built against his associates so far.</p>

He was once stopped by Detectives <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Thomas_.22Herc.22_Hauk" title="List of characters from The Wire">Thomas "Herc" Hauk</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Ellis_Carver" title="List of characters from The Wire">Ellis Carver</a> who seized 20,000 dollars from him - this was a small loss to the massive Barksdale organization.</p>
<p>Wee-Bey was twice involved in gunfights with legendary stick-up man <a href="../../../o/m/a/Omar_Little_33fc.html" title="Omar Little">Omar Little</a>. Their first encounter ended with Wee-Bey's friend <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Anton_.22Stinkum.22_Artis" title="List of characters from The Wire">Anton "Stinkum" Artis</a> dead and Wee-Bey himself being shot in the leg. Wee-Bey later defended Avon against Omar when the stickup man used their pager communication system to lure Avon to a payphone. This time Wee-Bey won the distinction of being one of the few people to best Omar in a gunfight as he hit him in the arm and forced his retreat.</p>
<p>Following his role in the failed sting operation that resulted in Greggs' injury Wee-Bey went on the run to family in Philadelphia. Before he left he murdered the other shooter, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Little_Man" title="List of characters from The Wire">Little Man</a>, on orders from Avon. The detail tracked him to Philadelphia and lured him outside by setting off his car alarm to ensure a clean arrest. Once in custody Wee-Bey confessed to all of his crimes and several more to protect the Barksdale organization.</p>
<p>Wee-Bey was imprisoned with Avon after the Barksdale detail's investigation in season one, serving life without parole for the numerous murders he committed. While in prison Wee-Bey continued to keep fish and enjoyed an easy life under Barksdale's wing. One guard in particular, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Dwight_Tilghman" title="List of characters from The Wire">Dwight Tilghman</a>, bothered Wee-Bey because he confessed to murdering a relative of his. Once Wee-Bey complained to Avon the problem was swiftly dealt with.<sup id="_ref-OCS_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-OCS" title="">[16]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-WB_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WB" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>

Charles explained to Cutty that sometimes you have to break the rules. The two gelled well together co-ordinating and conducting assaults on Stanfield territory. However, they were let down by their driver <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Tater" title="List of characters from The Wire">Tater</a> who failed follow their instructions in a co-ordinated assault and put himself, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Gerard" title="List of characters from The Wire">Gerard</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Country" title="List of characters from The Wire">Country</a> in the line of fire.

<p>Slim Charles and Cutty struck back alone to ensure that a better job was done. They attacks one of Marlo's crews and Charles killed a young drug dealer. Cutty allowed the crew chief to escape. Initially Charles thought that he had ruined Cutty's shot by firing too early himself. Cutty later admitted to Charles and Avon that he had been unable to take the shot and was retiring from his role. Charles and Avon agreed that Cutty was leaving "the game" with his reputation intact.</p>
<p>Slim Charles and Avon next oversaw an operation to assassinate Stanfield. They tried to ensare him using a girl, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Devonne" title="List of characters from The Wire">Devonne</a>, as bait.

Avon was wounded and another soldier was killed but Charles escaped unharmed.</p>
<p>Slim Charles was responsible for consoling Avon after the death of Stringer Bell. When Avon told Charles that he had lost heart for the war and that it was internal problems and not Stanfield that were responsible for Bell's death Charles reminded him that now that they were in a war there was no way to back down.</p>
<p>Slim Charles saw another opportunity to kill Stanfield when he found him at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Vinson" title="List of characters from The Wire">Vinson</a>'s rimshop with only Paltrow for protection. He phoned Avon who marshalled his soldiers to prepare their weapons. Avon's group were trapped in their base by a police raid and they were all arrested.

He escaped arraignment alongside Avon at the close of season three because he wasn't at the house when Avon was arrested.<sup id="_ref-OCS_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-OCS" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>

<p>Cutty is on old school soldier who was coming to the end of a fourteen year prison sentence when Avon and Wee-Bay arrived at the prison. He was well respected by Avon and many others in Barksdale’s crew for work he performed before going to prison including murder. Despite some initial hesitation, Cutty began working with the Barksdale crew after his release. His effectiveness and intelligence as muscle is shown on several occasions when planning raids, hits and general menacing for Avon against competing crews. However, it becomes clear that Cutty no longer has tolerance for “the game” and he tells Avon as much when he tries to leave the crew by saying “I ain’t got it in me no mo’.” Dennis then begins to build a new life by first doing day-labor landscaping and then by opening a boxing gym at the urging of a local church official. When he is unable to get sufficient funding to equip the gym, he approaches Avon to request the funding. Avon happily provides the money probably due to Avon’s history as a boxer.</p>

<p>Browning was a Barksdale organization drug dealer. He was arrested following a "hand-to-hand" - an investigating officer buys drugs from the suspect while undercover. Browning was on parole and faced a fifteen year minimum sentence for the offence. Despite this he refused to co-operate with the investigating officers and give them information on his superiors, deciding that he would rather face the years of prison time. While serving time in the city jail Browning identified <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Wendell_.22Orlando.22_Blocker" title="List of characters from The Wire">Wendell "Orlando" Blocker</a> and telephoned his superiors to tell them Orlando had been imprisoned.</p>

<p>Poot is a drug dealer in the Barksdale organization who has slowly risen through the ranks over the show's run. In season one Poot worked in the low rise projects territory called "the pit" under <a href="../../../d/27/a/D%27Angelo_Barksdale_7446.html" title="D'Angelo Barksdale">D'Angelo Barksdale</a> and was friends with fellow dealers <a href="../../../b/o/d/Bodie_Broadus_1278.html" title="Bodie Broadus">Bodie Broadus</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Wallace" title="List of characters from The Wire">Wallace</a>. He is depicted as having a very active sex life. In season one the Barksdale detail listen in on him having phone sex with a girlfriend.</p>
<p>Poot was trapped in the stash house with other members of his crew when it was robbed by <a href="../../../o/m/a/Omar_Little_33fc.html" title="Omar Little">Omar Little</a>. Although he was unhurt Poot was terrified enough to vomit when Omar left. He was with Wallace when they spotted Omar's boyfriend and accomplice in the heist <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Brandon" title="List of characters from The Wire">Brandon</a>. Wallace reported the sighting to D'Angelo and <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stringer_Bell_8a79.html" title="Stringer Bell">Stringer Bell</a> arrived soon afterwards with a trio of enforcers. Poot believed that Stringer would not come. Poot was not as affected as Wallace by the body of Brandon being displayed in their neighborhood as a warning to Omar. The trauma drove Wallace to leave working with the organization. Poot tried to get him to return to work but had no success. Poot followed Wallace and realised he had turned to drugs to escape his problems. He covered for Wallace with D'Angelo for some time but eventually told him the truth.</p>
<p>Poot stayed in touch with Wallace after the police moved Wallace away to the country - Walalce told Poot he had chosen to move to live with relatives. However, when Wallace returned to town and Stringer ordered him killed Poot and Bodie were there to carry out the orders. Bodie shot Wallace at Poot's urging and Poot took the gun and also fired shots at his former friend.</p>
<p>In season two Poot was rewarded with a promotion to D'Angelo's old position in charge of drug gealing in the pit. However, he had difficulty controlling his subordinates and struggled with the poor quality product available to the crew for a time. He continued to work with Bodie who was now in control of his own tower and overseeing the pit. He was significant enough to the organization to attend Stringer's strategy meetings at the funeral home. Bodie and Poot became embroiled in a turf war with an independent crew that led to the shooting of accidental shooting of a child.</p>
<p>At the close of season three Poot was arrested alongside Avon Barksdale.<sup id="_ref-OCS_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-OCS" title="">[16]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-PC_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PC" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>

<p>CCO was a Barksdale drug dealer working close to Stringer Bell. The Barksdale detail targeted him as one of the members of the organization that they wanted to convict and tried to get low level dealers like Marvin Browning to give them information on CCO, Stringer, Wee-Bey and Avon. Although a warrant was served against him CCO was not arrested with many other Barksdale dealers in season one. Stringer gave him instructions about cutting their new supply of narcotics to get it street ready.</p>

<p>Shamrock was <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stringer_Bell_8a79.html" title="Stringer Bell">Stringer Bell</a>'s second in command while <a href="../../../a/v/o/Avon_Barksdale_e5e8.html" title="Avon Barksdale">Avon Barksdale</a> was in prison and oversaw the technical aspects of the drug operation on his behalf. Stringer sounded out his loyalty, along with <a href="../../../b/o/d/Bodie_Broadus_1278.html" title="Bodie Broadus">Bodie Broadus</a>, by having him followed on a trip to Philadelphia to collect a package of drugs. The package was not delivered to Shamrock but he kept to Stringer's orders and meticulously documented his progress. Despite the missing package Stringer was satisfied with their response.</p>
<p>Stringer entrusted Shamrock with driving Bodie to dispose of the weapons used in a misguided territory war after a young child was killed by a stray bullet. Unfortunately Shamrock and Bodie dropped the bag of guns onto a passing freight ship instead of into the water. Little came of it because Bodie had wiped the weapons clean of prints.</p>
<p>Stringer entrusted Shamrock with the set-up of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Dwight_Tilghman" title="List of characters from The Wire">CO Dwight Tilghman</a> to allow Avon to exchange information about Tilghman with the prison authorities for an early parole hearing. Stringer, Shamrock and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Country" title="List of characters from The Wire">Country</a> followed Tilghman and learned that he was smuggling heroin into the prison from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Butchie" title="List of characters from The Wire">Butchie</a>. Stringer had Shamrock deliver a package of tainted narcotics to Tilghman through Butchie causing several deaths in the prison. Shamrock also planted narcotics in Tilghman's car to make sure Avon could successfully inform on Tilghman.</p>
<p>Shamrock oversaw Stringers organizational meetings at the funeral home and tried to keep to Robert's rules of order. He was overzealous in following the rules and made the mistake of trying to keep minutres at the first meeting of Stringer co-op, a group of major Baltimore drug players. Stringer curtly reminded Shamrock that he was taking notes on a criminal conspiracy.</p>
<p>Stringer used Shamrock to insulate himself from the street, Shamrock would take phone calls on Stringer's behalf and then organize face to face meetings at secure locations. Shamrock also often acted as a driver for Stringer. Stringer put Shamrock in charge of overseeing <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Bernard" title="List of characters from The Wire">Bernard</a> in obtaining disposable cell phones for the organization and then programming the phones for use by the drug dealers. Stringer insisted that Bernard buy a maximum of two phones from any one outlet and checked his receipts to see that he stuck to the rule. Once Shamrock took over he stopped checking up on Bernard and Bernard began to buy phones in bulk eventually getting them from <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lester_Freamon_2523.html" title="Lester Freamon">Lester Freamon</a>, an undercover officer in the unit investigating Stringer. Freamon was thereby able to supply Shamrock with pre-wiretapped phones through Bernard.</p>
<p>When Avon was paroled Shamrock continued in his role as Stringer's assistant controlling their drug dealing threw the lieutenants and crew chiefs. Shamrock was peripherally involved in Avon's turf war with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Marlo_Stanfield" title="List of characters from The Wire">Marlo Stanfield</a>, passing messages back and forth to soldiers.

<p>A young drug dealer in the Barksdale crew's low rise projects organization (called The Pit) under <a href="../../../d/27/a/D%27Angelo_Barksdale_7446.html" title="D'Angelo Barksdale">D'Angelo Barksdale</a>. Wallace was friends with other dealers <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Malik_.22Poot.22_Carr" title="List of characters from The Wire">Malik "Poot" Carr</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/d/Bodie_Broadus_1278.html" title="Bodie Broadus">Bodie Broadus</a>.</p>
<p>Wallace showed the signs of a half finished education - he could identify famous people on currency better than the rest of his crew but sometimes struggled with the math of dealing and though eager to learn, did not know the rules of chess. He also took responsibility for his numerous younger children in the projects; he was seen packing their lunches, seeing them off to school and helping them with their homework. He betrayed his age when he was found playing with toys when he was supposed to be on lookout duty.</p>
<p>After <a href="../../../o/m/a/Omar_Little_33fc.html" title="Omar Little">Omar Little</a> robbed the pit crew's stash of drugs Wallace spotted his accomplice <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Brandon" title="List of characters from The Wire">Brandon</a> playing pinball and called this information in to D'Angelo. Wallace waited outside the arcade for <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stringer_Bell_8a79.html" title="Stringer Bell">Stringer Bell</a> to arrive and when he did he had Wallace point out Brandon. Brandon was then tortured to death and his body was displayed on the hood of a car, coincidentally outside of Wallace's home. Wallace received a quarter of the $2000 bounty on Brandon's head, but was sickened by the event and decided that he wanted out of "the game". He approached D'Angelo and told him he wanted to go back to school - D'Angelo gave him his blessing and some cash. Poot soon found that Wallace had spent the money on drugs and was spending most of his time at home.</p>
<p>Wallace was picked up by the police and agreed to cooperate with the Barksdale detail, revealing Stinger's involvement in the killing of Omar's boyfriend Brandon. In order to keep him safe until the time came to testify, the detail sent Wallace to live with his grandmother in rural <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge%2C_Maryland_aacf.html" title="Cambridge, Maryland">Cambridge</a>. After <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakima__Kima__Greggs_6baa.html" title="Shakima &quot;Kima&quot; Greggs">Detective Shakima "Kima" Greggs</a> was shot in an undercover operation, the Barksdale detail became so preoccupied with her condition that Wallace was temporarily forgotten. Bored with life away from Baltimore (and having kept in telephone contact with Poot), he returned to the low-rise projects and asked to get involved in the trade again. Bodie suggested he would have to take a demotion but D'Angelo welcomed him back. Stringer Bell became suspicious of Wallace's return and questioned D'Angelo about him. D'Angelo unwittingly tried to reassure Stringer of Wallace's loyalty but Stringer was unconvinced and assigned Bodie to kill Wallace. Bodie and Poot spent the day with Wallace and took him home. Bodie revealed their intentions once they had him cornered and Wallace begged for mercy because of their friendship. Bodie eventually worked up the nerve to kill Wallace and Poot took the gun and finished him off.</p>
<p>D'Angelo was outraged by Wallace's death. It was one of the factors that led D'Angelo to want to leave "the game" himself, and it drove a permanent wedge between he and Stringer (as D'Angelo intuitively sensed Stringer's involvement in the boy's death).</p>
<p>Creator <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Simon_0c5b.html" title="David Simon">David Simon</a> has described Wallace as an emotional centre to the shows first season and praised Jordan's performance, saying that he was sorry the character had to leave but that the story comes first. Simon sees the character as an illustration of the adage "a 14 year old drug dealer is still 14."<sup id="_ref-Target_Commentary_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Target_Commentary" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>

She first appeared bringing food to D'Angelo at work. Brianna grew up in Western Baltimore and her family has always been involved in the drug trade. With her brother Avon controlling narcotics on the Westside Brianna acts as an advisor and helps to manage their profits and receives a healthy income, nice home and new car for her efforts. She raised her son to manage the tought streets and got him working in the family business as soon as he was old enough. D'Angelo was quickly made a lieutenant in Avon's operation despite some misgivings. When D'Angelo was tried for murder Brianna was conspicuously absent from the courtroom. Later she appeared fiercely protective of her son when he was arrested for drug trafficking. She insisted that Avon was in the wrong for sending him alone to pick up a package of narcotics and made her brother promise to do everything he could to help D'Angelo.</p>
<p>When D'Angelo appeared ready to turn against his family it was Brianna who visited him and changed his mind, convincing him to accept a lengthy prison sentence to protect Avon by insisting that Avon would do the same if D'Angelo was willing to step up and run the business. When D'Angelo once more began to withdraw from his family in prison Brianna visited him to try and talk him around. This time D'Angelo insisted that he did not want to see her any more. When D'Angelo appeared to have committed suicide in the prison Brianna was distraught. She was comforted by her brother's second-in-command <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stringer_Bell_8a79.html" title="Stringer Bell">Stringer Bell</a>, actually the man who had ordered D'Angelo's death. Brianna argued with Avon to allow Stringer to manage their business his way while Avon was imprisoned.</p>
<p>When Avon was released she continued to advise both men. After <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_McNulty_a94e.html" title="Jimmy McNulty">Jimmy McNulty</a>, having done independent policework, told <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Donette" title="List of characters from The Wire">Donette</a> that there was a chance D'Angelo had been murdered, Donette, unsure of whether to believe him passed the information on to Brianna. Brianna, suspicious, met with McNulty and was convinced by the evidence. She asked Avon, indirectly at first, if he had ordered D'Angelo's killing. He truthfully denied having anything to do with it, although by this point Stringer had admitted ordering the murder to Avon.<sup id="_ref-OCS_5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-OCS" title="">[16]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-BB_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BB" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>

<p>Proposition Joe is an Eastside drug kingpin who goes into business with <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stringer_Bell_8a79.html" title="Stringer Bell">Stringer Bell</a>. He seems portly and amiable, but is easily a match for <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Avon_Barksdale" title="List of characters from The Wire">Avon</a> and Stringer. Like Stringer, he prefers a peaceful solution to business disputes when possible.</p>
<p>In season one he first appeared at an annual basketball game, the Eastside druglord's team versus the Westside druglord's. Prop Joe's team had won for three years straight, and <a href="../../../a/v/o/Avon_Barksdale_e5e8.html" title="Avon Barksdale">Avon Barksdale</a> wanted vengeance. Joe played on Avon's pride, goading him into doubling their wager on the outcome, then bringing in a ringer at the last minute to win the game. That same day he was visited by <a href="../../../o/m/a/Omar_Little_33fc.html" title="Omar Little">Omar</a>, who gave Joe some of the Barksdale gang's stolen stash in exchange for Avon's pager number, and used it to make an attempt on Avon's life. Prop Joe's role in Omar's attack remained unknown to Avon. Joe later served as a neutral go between organising a meeting between <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stringer_Bell_8a79.html" title="Stringer Bell">Stringer Bell</a> and Omar to discuss truce</p>
<p>In season two he began playing a larger role in the show. He relied on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#.22The_Greek.22" title="List of characters from The Wire">Greek's</a> smuggling ring to bring his drug shipments into the Baltimore ports. His supply was much more potent than Avon's, though he lacked the territory to market it. His solution was to make an offer to Stringer Bell: his product in exchange for the right to deal in some of the Barksdale towers. Avon vehemently rejected the idea, but Stringer secretly agreed to the deal. When Avon hired <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Brother_Mouzone" title="List of characters from The Wire">Brother Mouzone</a> to chase Prop Joe's dealers out of the towers, Joe's nephew and lieutenant <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Calvin_.22Cheese.22_Wagstaff" title="List of characters from The Wire">Calvin "Cheese" Wagstaff</a> was shot and wounded. Joe came up with the idea of pitting Omar against Mouzone. He set up a meeting between Stringer and Omar, where the stickup man was tricked into shooting Mouzone. This elaborate deception became unnecessary when Avon grudgingly agreed to the alliance between Stringer and Joe. At the end of season two, Stringer and Prop Joe were photographed meeting by detectives <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_McNulty_a94e.html" title="Jimmy McNulty">McNulty</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakima__Kima__Greggs_6baa.html" title="Shakima &quot;Kima&quot; Greggs">Greggs</a>.<sup id="_ref-SLN_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SLN" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>In season three Joe extended the sharing of his supply connections to many other drug dealers in Baltimore by forming the "co-op" group. Joe was now working with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Fatface_Rick" title="List of characters from The Wire">Fatface Rick</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Kintell_Williamson" title="List of characters from The Wire">Kintell Williamson</a> among others. He provided all of these dealers with his package and received a discount for the bulk buying. He insulated himself against investigation by maintaining a strict policy of only meeting face to face.</p>
<p>Joe's family once more brought him problems in his business life. Unbeknownst to him his nephew Drack had been targeted as a potential inroad for an investigation by Lieutenant <a href="../../../c/e/d/Cedric_Daniels_da38.html" title="Cedric Daniels">Cedric Daniels</a> major case unit. Cheese became embroiled in a war with a rival drug crew over a dog fight that resulted in several deaths. Daniels wiretaps were instrumental in solving the homicides but Daniels tipped his hand when he arrested Cheese belieiving that he had him on tape discussing a murder. Cheese realized that the police had a tape of him talking about shooting his pet dog and they were forced to release him. He reported the incident to Proposition Joe who was forewarned about the investigation and able to pass the information on to Stringer. The major case unit were forced to move their investigation away from Joe and onto the more violent Kintell Williamson when they failed to make any progress.</p>

Triage responded by killing Jelly which triggered a short war between the rival crews and a further two deaths. Cell phone talk about the war was picked up by the major case unit and they arrested Jelly and Triage preparing for another assault. The unit had cheese on tape talking about shooting his dog and mistakenly believed it was evidence that he was responsible for one of the murders. They told Cheese about the wiretaps when trying to force a confession. Once the unit realized Cheese was talking about an animal he was released.

The two often pull various scams to get drug money.</p>
<p>In season one, Johnny was severely beaten by the Barksdale hoppers when he tried to pass them counterfeit bills. Bubbles then offered to inform on the Barksdale gang for Greggs, to get some measure of revenge. Bubbles' knowledge of the street proved to be invaluable to <a href="../../../c/e/d/Cedric_Daniels_da38.html" title="Cedric Daniels">Lt. Daniels'</a> unit. He helped identify members of the crew that ran the Barksdale pit. When Omar robbed the Barksdale stash, Bubbles was there, and gave the license plate number of <a href="../../../o/m/a/Omar_Little_33fc.html" title="Omar Little">Omar's</a> van to Greggs, which helped the detail track down the stick-up man.</p>
<p>After he was nearly killed trying to steal some drugs, he tried to get off the needle, but reverted to his old habits when Greggs was shot.</p>

<p>Muscle and hitman from New York. In season two, Avon Barksdale hired him to protect the Barksdale turf and their drug operation from Proposition Joe's dealers, who were working at the Barksdale towers as part of a secret agreement between Stringer Bell and Prop Joe. Mouzone did not fit the usual picture of a hitman, always wearing a suit, bowtie, and glasses, speaking politely, and reading magazines such as <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harper%27s_Magazine_7616.html" title="Harper's Magazine">Harper's</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Nation_3a20.html" title="The Nation">The Nation</a>. Nonetheless, he was extremely effective; soon after his arrival at the Barksdale towers, he had intimidated Prop Joe's dealers to the point where all he had to do to keep them off was sit on a nearby bench and read his magazines. In order to maintain his alliance with Prop Joe, Stringer duped Omar Little into shooting Mouzone. However, Omar realized he had been had, and let Mouzone live. When Stringer visited him at the hospital, Mouzone informed him that their agreement was "absolved", then returned to New York.</p>
<p>In season three, Mouzone returned to Baltimore to search for Omar. They teamed up to kill Stringer Bell.</p>

<p>Ziggy is <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Frank_Sobotka" title="List of characters from The Wire">Frank Sobotka</a>'s son and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Nick_Sobtoka" title="List of characters from The Wire">Nick</a>'s cousin. Ziggy was ostensibly a dock worker in his father's Stevedores union but he was also involved in other criminal activity. Like most of the port workers Ziggy frequented <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Delores" title="List of characters from The Wire">Delores</a>' bar and his drunken antics were a source of amusement to the customers. He was known for publicly exposing himself. His work on the docks was often poor and his father would regularly fire him and then reinstate him. Ziggy received little work because of a his lack of seniority compared to other union members.</p>
<p>Ziggy had been dealing drugs supplied by <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#.22White.22_Mike_McArdle" title="List of characters from The Wire">"White" Mike McArdle</a> for some time. He sold them at street level using an East side dealer known as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Frog" title="List of characters from The Wire">Frog</a>. Ziggy had trouble intimidating Frog and often came up short with the money from his packages. Frog would keep the money and tell Ziggy he had been robbed. Eventually White Mike refused to supply Ziggy with further drugs because he knew that he was not a sound investment.</p>
<p>Ziggy often tried to convince his more streetwise cousin Nick into joining him in his drug dealing enterprise but Nick refused. When Ziggy suggested that they steal a container of digital cameras from the docks Nick was more accepting. They worked alongside their friend <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Johnny_.22Fifty.22_Spamanto" title="List of characters from The Wire">Johnny "Fifty" Spamanto</a>, a checker, to move the container through the port. Ziggy and Nick visited <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#George_.22Double_G.22_Glekas" title="List of characters from The Wire">George "Double G" Glekas</a>, a front man for an international smuggling operation that the Sobotka family had been working with, to offer him the container. Ziggy's research about the street value of the cameras allowed Nick to negotiate a better deal with Glekas. Ziggy upset Glekas by taking his photo with one of the cameras during the meeting and Glekas angrily snatched it from Ziggy and smashed it on the floor.</p>
<p>Ziggy also accompanied Nick to a meeting to discuss Frank's smuggling of containers through the docks. Ziggy's chatter embarrassed Nick and he vowed not to take him again. The Greeks asked Nick to obtain shipments of chemicals through his work at the port. Unsure what the chemicals would be used for Nick was reluctant to get involved. Ziggy used his share of the money from the stolen cameras to buy a new leather coat and Nick chastised him for flashing his newfound wealth.</p>
<p>Ziggy turned to a drug dealer named <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Calvin_.22Cheese.22_Wagstaff" title="List of characters from The Wire">Cheese</a> for a fresh supply. Cheese was a lieutenant in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#.22Proposition.22_Joe_Stewart" title="List of characters from The Wire">"Proposition" Joe Stewart</a>'s network of drug dealers. Ziggy continued to use Frog and again came up short on his profits and found himself unable to pay Cheese back. Cheese was more brutal than White Mike and delivered a swift beating to Ziggy and stole his prized car (a Camaro which Ziggy called princess). Cheese threatened to kill Ziggy if he was not able to pay by the end of the week. Nick and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#La_La" title="List of characters from The Wire">La La</a>, a friend from the union, visited Cheese on Ziggy's behalf hoping to bargain the value of the car that Cheese had taken against Ziggy's debt. They found that Cheese had burned the car and was now asking for more money but willing to give Ziggy a little more time. Ziggy was distraught when he heard this news.</p>
<p>Nick went to the Greeks to ask for help with the problem. He found that they were the suppliers of Proposition Joe's entire operation and were able to negotiate with him directly. Nick attended a sit-down with Joe on Ziggy's behalf. Because fo their assocaition with the Greeks Joe agreed to waive Ziggy's debt and give him compensation for the car.</p>
<p>Ziggy helped Nick to research the chemical the Greeks were looking for and found that they were used in the processing of cocaine. Reassured with this knowledge Nick decided to go ahead and steal them as asked. After Nick and Ziggy delivered the chemicals they were offered payment in either narcotics or cash. Knowing the street value of the narcotics was greater Ziggy wanted to take them. Nick opted to receive half in cash and half in heroin. Nick kept Ziggy out of dealing with the drugs and took them to Frog himself. He faithfully delivered a share of the profits to Ziggy each week. Ziggy's pride was hurt by Nick sidelining him and having continued success in an area where Ziggy had failed. Eventually Ziggy refused his share of the money.</p>
<p>Ziggy had a longrunning feud with a dock worker named <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Maui" title="List of characters from The Wire">Maui</a>. Maui took issue with Ziggy stealing from the docks and confronted him. Ziggy responded by hacking into Maui's computer and copying pictures of his genatalia onto it. Maui faked a paternity lawsuit against Ziggy which drove him to a drinking binge. Nick realized that the letter Ziggy had received from a law firm was false and identified Maui as the culprit. Urged on by La La and other Stevedores Ziggy attacked Maui while working at the docks. He was easily overcome by his much larger opponent. As a result of the fight Ziggy was forced to endure another indignity; Maui used a fork lift truck to strand Ziggy on top of a stack of containers. Ziggy purchased a pet duck and brought it to the bar with him, giving it saucers of liquor to drink. The duck died at the bar driving Ziggy into another depressive episode. When Nick approached him he attacked his cousin. Frank found his son wandering the docks alone and the two discussed their Ziggy's childhood.</p>
<p>Ziggy decided to go into smuggling cars with Johnny Fifty. He offered to supply them to Glekas, who reluctantly agreed. Ziggy faked the theft of their cars to look like an outside job by cutting a hole in the port fence and making a track across a grassy area. Rather than using these constructions he drove the cars through the front of the port. When Ziggy delivered the cars Glekas refused to pay him the agreed sum and Ziggy flew into a rage. Glekas beat Ziggy and threw him out of his warehouse. This was the last indiginity Ziggy could endure; he took a gun from his car and shot Glekas killing him and one of his staff. Horrified at his actions Ziggy was unable to drive away and broke down in tears.</p>
<p>He was picked up by <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Jay_Landsman" title="List of characters from The Wire">Sergeant Landsman</a> of the homicide unit and gave a full confession to the murders. Frank visited Ziggy in prison and apologised for not doing more to help his son, Ziggy told Frank that the union had always come before him. Ziggy was convicted of the murders and was last seen serving out his sentence.<sup id="_ref-Zig_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Zig" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>The actor who portrays Ziggy, James Ransone, is a Baltimore antive and has described the character as representative of the difficulties people face just trying to get by in Baltimore. The character's creators have deemed him "the angry prince of goofs."<sup id="_ref-RAZ_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RAZ" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>

<p>Frank Sobotka was a Stevedores union leader who worked with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#.22The_Greek.22" title="List of characters from The Wire">"The Greek"</a> to smuggle goods through the Baltimore docks. Sobotka became involved in smuggling to fund political campaign contributions to try to sway politicians into funding initiatives that would save the Baltimore port. Sobotka's two main objectives were to have the docks dredged to increase the depth for incoming ships and to re-open the granary pier.</p>
<p>Sobotka had a family consisting of his wife, who was never seen, and his son <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Chester_.22Ziggy.22_Sobotka" title="List of characters from The Wire">Chester "Ziggy" Sobotka</a>.

Both Ziggy and Nick worked in Frank's union. Nick often acted as go-between for Frank and the Greeks passing messages back and forth and giving Frank lists of containers to move to The Greeks. Frank relied on his old friend and fellow union man Thomas "Horseface" Pakusa to move these containers for him and made sure he was always assigned to ships with contraband on board. Ziggy was involved in crime in Baltimore but Frank was largely unaware of his activity and did not include him in his association with The Greeks.<sup id="_ref-FRS_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FRS" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>

<p><a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Frank_Sobotka" title="List of characters from The Wire">Frank Sobotka</a>'s nephew. Nick was also a dock worker in his uncle's union. He often had to keep his cousin <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Chester_.22Ziggy.22_Sobotka" title="List of characters from The Wire">Ziggy</a> out of trouble. Nick was much more cautious and level-headed than Ziggy, a fact his uncle appreciated. He was involved in his uncle's smuggling operation and often served as Frank's go-between in meetings with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Spiros_.22Vondas.22_Vondopoulos" title="List of characters from The Wire">Vondas</a>. He would meet with Vondas at the diner which served as the Greek's "office." Vondas would give him the serial numbers of the cargo containers the Greek was bringing into the port, and Nick would convey this information to his uncle.</p>
<p>Nick had a girlfriend, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Aimee" title="List of characters from The Wire">Aimee</a>, with whom he had a daughter, Ashley. They wanted to move in together, but they were unable to afford a place of their own; Nick lived with his parents, and when she spent the night with him, she had to hide from them. Though Nick very much wanted to settle down with her, his lack of steady income led to tensions between them.</p>
<p>Since Nick was one of the younger stevedores, seniority prevented him from getting enough work at the docks. Desperate for cash, he and Ziggy stole a trailer full of cameras, which they sold to the Greek's front man, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#George_.22Double_G.22_Glekas" title="List of characters from The Wire">Glekas</a>. This brought Nick to the attention of Vondas, who asked him if he could procure large quantities of certain chemicals. Ziggy was immediately interested, but Nick was more conscientious, fearing that the chemicals would be used to make bombs. After some research on the internet, he discovered that they would be used to process drugs, and he agreed to the deal.</p>
<p>Ziggy was into drug dealing and invited Nick to join in, but at first Nick angrily refused. Later, when Ziggy's ineptitude nearly cost him his life at the hands of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#.22Proposition.22_Joe_Stewart" title="List of characters from The Wire">Proposition Joe's</a> nephew <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Calvin_.22Cheese.22_Wagstaff" title="List of characters from The Wire">Cheese</a>, Nick asked Vondas to intervene. Vondas sent <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Sergei" title="List of characters from The Wire">Sergei "Serge" Malatov</a>, who forced Cheese to back off at gunpoint. Sergei then helped Nick negotiate a settlement with Prop Joe himself.</p>
<p>When the two cousins brought Vondas the chemicals he had requested, Nick asked for payment half in cash, half in heroin. Since Ziggy had proved incompetent, he began selling the drugs to local dealers, with much more success than his cousin. He was spotted meeting with the dealer Frog by <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas__Herc__Hauk_8f00.html" title="Thomas &quot;Herc&quot; Hauk">Herc</a> and <a href="../../../e/l/l/Ellis_Carver_c411.html" title="Ellis Carver">Carver</a>, who were doing surveillance of drug dealers near the port. When the drugs he'd received for the chemicals ran out, Vondas put him in contact with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#.22White.22_Mike_McArdle" title="List of characters from The Wire">"White" Mike McArdle</a>, who became his new supplier of heroin.</p>
<p>Eventually a warrant was issued for Nick's arrest. The police raided his parents' house, shortly after Ziggy was arrested for the murder of Glekas. Though Nick was not home, his parents were aghast when the police found drugs and cash in his bedroom.</p>
<p>Later that day Vondas approached Nick with an offer to help Ziggy, in exchange for his and Frank's silence. The young Sobotka eagerly conveyed the offer to his uncle. Frank told Nick he would go see the Greek alone. Just before the meeting, the Greek learned that Frank had offered to testify against him, and he had the elder Sobotka killed. A grieving Nick turned himself in to the police, agreeing to become a witness against the Greek and his gang. As his uncle had, he refused to incriminate members of his union. When Daniels' detail interrogated him he identified the Greek in a photograph, giving the detail its first picture of its main target.</p>
<p>At the end of season two, Nick, Aimee, and Ashley entered federal witness protection.<sup id="_ref-NIS_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NIS" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>

Nat is a firm believer that the unions should focus on repairing the disused grain pier before it is bought by property developers. He opposes Frank's efforts to have the canal dredged as he believes that this is a goal beyond their reach. Nat is concerned about Frank's surge in income and spending on campaign contributions and hiring a lobbyist. He questions Frank about the source of the funds and when Frank refuses to answer Nat cautions him about the risks of showing so much money.</p>
<p>Nat is an advocate for <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Ott" title="List of characters from The Wire">Ott</a> in the forthcoming union election.

Frank asks Nat to allow him to continue for a second term to try and achieve his political goals and Nat is dubious. When Frank is murdered Nat is horrified along with the other Stevedores. Nat's worst fears are realized when the grain pier is converted into condominiums.</p>

<p>Serge acts as a driver and muscle for <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#.22The_Greek.22" title="List of characters from The Wire">The Greek</a>. Sergei was Ukrainian although people often assumed he was Russian and many called him Boris. He was responsible for picking up containers of stolen goods from the port and taking them to The Greek's front warehouse. Sergei was supposed to collect a container carrying prostitutes but when the Greek's crewman on board the ship that delivered the cargo failed to signal him he abandoned the container. The Greeks later learned that the girls had all suffocated and Sergei was sent to the ships next destination to find the crewman. He used fake ID to infiltrate the Philadelphia port and captured and interrogated the crewman but was unable to extract any useful information. When The Greek and Spiros arrived the crewman told them everything about how the girls were killed and Spiros murdered him. Sergei was charged with disposing of the body and The Greek instructed him to make sure there was no face or fingerprints.</p>
<p>Sergei was convinced to inform on The Greek when security camera footage of him assualting and abducting the crewman was discovered by a police detail investigating the deaths of the girls.<sup id="_ref-SSM_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SSM" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>

<p>Sam was a Turkish crewman aboard the container ship "The Atlantic Light" who acted as an inside man for [[List of characters from The Wire#"The Greek"|The Greek's smuggling operation. When bringing a container full of young women destined for the sex industry to Baltimore Sam let them out of the container and prostituted them to the rest of the crew himself. When one girl refused to participate she was beaten to death and thrown overboard. Because the other women witnessed the murder Sam locked them back in the container and cut off their air supply by hammering closed the air pipe. When the ship docked and the container was unloaded he was supposed to signal the driver, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Sergei_.22Serge.22_Malatov" title="List of characters from The Wire">Serge</a>, that it was safe to take the container. When Sam failed to give the signal Serge left the docks and the container was moved into the stacks. Port officer <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Beatrice_.22Beadie.22_Russell" title="List of characters from The Wire">Russell</a> discovered the bodies, eventually triggering a homicide investigation.</p>
<p>Sam's ship was held at it's next port, Philadelphia, by the police so that the crew could be questioned. He jumped ship but was picked up by Serge on orders from the Greek. The Greek interrogated Sam personally and, once he learned what had happened, had him executed by <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Spiros_.22Vondas.22_Vondopoulos" title="List of characters from The Wire">Vondas</a>. The Greek ordered Sergei to remove Sam's hands and head.</p>
<p>The homicide investigators eventually deduced what had happened to the girls in the container and managed to identify Sam's body through his tattoos solving their original case. They also charged Serge with Sam's murder after tying him to Sam's abduction with security camera footage. However, both The Greek and Vondas escaped any repercussions of their involvement.</p>

He was even-tempered and patient, often having to soothe an increasingly angry and frightened Sobotka as the Baltimore police began a serious investigation into Sobotka's union. He also handled much less savory tasks: when a sailor in the Greek's employ, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Sam" title="List of characters from The Wire">Sam</a>, murdered fourteen girls meant for work as prostitutes Vondas killed the man once the Greek had interrogated him.

<p>He often met with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Nick_Sobotka" title="List of characters from The Wire">Nick Sobotka</a>, who frequently served as Frank's go-between, and Vondas took an almost paternal interest in the younger man. Impressed with Nick's intelligence, he gave him the task of stealing a shipment of chemicals. He intervened in a dispute over a debt between Nick's cousin <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Chester_.22Ziggy.22_Sobotka" title="List of characters from The Wire">Ziggy</a> and a drug dealer supplied by the Greeks, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Calvin_.22Cheese.22_Wagstaff" title="List of characters from The Wire">Calvin "Cheese" Wagstaff</a>.

Vondas' distrust of Ziggy proved correct when Ziggy killed Glekas in an argument over payment for stolen goods. Ziggy was arrested soon afterwards and Vondas distanced the murder from the rest of the operation by removing all evidence of the business from the warehouse.</p>
<p>When the <a href="../../../c/e/d/Cedric_Daniels_da38.html" title="Cedric Daniels">Lieutenant Daniels</a>' port detail began investigating the Greeks activity Frank Sobotka realized and tipped Vondas. The Greek ordered Vondas to shut down the smuggling temporarily and replace all of his personnel's telephones. The Greek withdrew from their meeting place at the cafe and began meeting Vondas in hotel rooms.</p>
<p>Vondas escaped arrest when the detail began rounding up the members of the Greek's smuggling ring. When Sobotka was arrested Vondas suggested that they could broker his loyalty by having a witness against Ziggy change his story. He put the proposition to Frank through Nick. Frank had already agreed to testify against the Greeks but decided to meet with them for Ziggy's sake. The Greek learned of Frank's agreement through his inside man at the FBI, agent Koutris, and had Vondas murder Frank.</p>
<p>Following the murder Vondas left the country under a fake passport with the Greek. Before Vondas left he met with Proposition Joe to ensure him that the Greeks operation would continue to supply him using new personnel after a short break to avoid the investigation.<sup id="_ref-SPV_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SPV" title="">[38]</a></sup></p>

His drug dealing contacts include the influential <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#.22Proposition.22_Joe_Stewart" title="List of characters from The Wire">"Proposition" Joe Stewart</a> as well as smaller organizations like those run by <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#.22White.22_Mike_McArdle" title="List of characters from The Wire">"White" Mike McArdle</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Petey_Dixon" title="List of characters from The Wire">Petey Dixon</a>. The Greek pays union Stevedores to move containers through the Baltimore port for him and organizes their activity through Vondas. His sex trade interests in Baltimore include a brothel run by a madam named <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Ilona" title="List of characters from The Wire">Ilona</a>. He protects himself from federal investigation by having an agent inside the FBI, a man named <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Koutris" title="List of characters from The Wire">Koutris</a>.</p>
<p>The Greek began to draw police attention in Baltimore when his contact at the docks, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Frank_Sobotka" title="List of characters from The Wire">Frank Sobotka</a>, became the target of an investigation. At the same time a container of dead young women intended for the sex trade was discovered at the docks triggering a high profile homicide investigation. The container belonged to The Greek and the girls were killed by a crewman onboard The Atlantic Light, the vessel that had been due to deliver them. The ship's crew had been paying the girls for sex and when one of the girls refused to participate she was killed and the crewman responsible dumped her overboard and stove in the air supply on the top of the container to kill the remaining women. The Greek tracked the crewman down and had him killed, first interrogating him personally to find out how he had ended up losing the valuable resource that the women represented. Serge was responsible for finding the man but it was Vondas who killed him. The Greek expressed a distaste for the crewman's Turkish nationality but spoke his language fluently. The body was dismembered in The Greek's preferred fashion - removing the head and hands to hinder identification.</p>
<p>The police investigation linked the murder to Serge and the drug operation to Eton, White Mike and Proposition Joe (although they were unable to find evidence against Proposition Joe). The port smuggling was thoroughly investigated and when police began tracking The Greeks containers as they left the port he was warned by Frank Sobotka and began to close down his operation temporarily. The Greek and Vondas decided to leave Baltimore when arrests were made against Sobotka, Ilona, Eton, White Mike and Serge. They contacted Sobotka to try to ensure his loyalty by offering help for his son, imprisoned for shooting Double G in a stolen car deal gone awry. Sobotka agreed to meet with The Greek and also offered to co-operate with the police. The Greek learned of this from Agent Koutris and had Sobotka killed and his body dumped into the docks. Frank's nephew, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Nick_Sobotka" title="List of characters from The Wire">Nick Sobotka</a>, was involved in the smuggling operation as a go-between and was driven to co-operate with the police by his uncle's death. He was able to identify The Greek and Vondas but with no further information the investigation fizzled out.</p>
<p>Before leaving Baltimore Vondas met with Proposition Joe to confirm that they could continue to supply him keeping some of The Greek's business interests alive in the city. Later Proposition Joe entered into a bargain with other drug dealers, called the co-op, to share The Greek's product with them in exchange for reduced violence and sharing of territory.<sup id="_ref-GRK_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GRK" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>
