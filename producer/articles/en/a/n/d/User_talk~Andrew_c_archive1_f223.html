<p>I'm not sure if you are monitoring the talk page of <a href="../../../e/m/e/Emergency_contraception.html" title="Emergency contraception">Emergency contraception</a>, if you aren't I appologized publicly to you. I don't mean to be hasty or revert blindly, and I am sure that you are trying to help wikipedia. It is just that when you removed some of those paragraphs I felt it not only disrupted the flow, but also got rid of some information. In the future I hope we can discus things, before engaging in any revert wars. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChooserr_aa51.html" title="User:Chooserr">Chooserr</a> 02:54, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks. I was initially caught off guard about your revert without any discussion on the talk page, but it wasn't a big enough deal to me for me to get in a revert war. I'm glad we can attempt to talk this out, and I hope you like the suggestions <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> made on the talk page.

<dd>I've looked briefly over it, but my primary concern is Hipocrite who seems to be opposing me on three articles. If you were to look back to the originally version by me you will see that I readded the section on ECs effects on pre-born babies and even cited a link by planned parenthood that said while no effects are known they wouldn't recommend use if you were pregnant. Also I think my wording was considerably NPOV. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChooserr_aa51.html" title="User:Chooserr">Chooserr</a> 00:46, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I guess I was thinking in particular of higher Biblical criticism, which attempts to place the Bible in its historical and cultural context. What we have now lacks this context; it's basically a minimalist version of the Biblical Jesus that people will either consider to be too secular or too religious/hagiographic, depending on their own POV.

<dd>Thanks for the compliment, and thanks for the list of libraries! I have the easy part out of the way, quoting the sources already cited under note 1 for the dates. Now I just have to sift through the others to find the appropriate information (and track down those last few books). It looks like the Cohen book doesn't have a date range for Jesus (he is seriously only mentioned in passing on maybe half a dozen pages). I'll keep updating over the next few days. I'll have these books in my possession for the next month and a half, so if there is anything else you want me to check up on, just holler.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 02:46, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Nice work also on Ebionites and Marcionites. I just think they need to be condensed to one paragraph apiece, to avoid giving undue weight. We can then remove the subheaders ;) Also, what's the difference between Gnostics and Marcionites? <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArchola_35bb.html" title="User:Archola">Arch O.

<dd>I was wondering if a better approach might be to just describe terms like adoptionism and docetism, and briefly link to early Christian groups who held these views? Or we could just rework what we have. Anyway, the difference between Gnostic and Marcionites was significant. While Marcionites had their own Churches and had split off from Orthodoxy, Gnostics were a secret elitist group hidden within Orthodox Christian sects. By 'day' they appeared as any other member of the Chruch, but by 'night' they believed they held the secret teachings of Jesus that gave them the wisdom to escape the evils of the material world. It also seems that while there were some Gnostics who had similar docetic views to Marcionites, most Gnostics believed that Jesus was a regular human who was possessed by the Spirit of The Christ at baptism (in the symbolic form of a dove), and was later abandon by the Christ at the crucifixion (thus the 'Why have you forsaken me?' bit), only to return to resurrect the body of Jesus. Hmm... I might change the Gnostic section. I'm pretty happy with the Ebionites section (but if we need to shorten it, we could loose the last paragraph), and I feel like the Marcionite section needs major work. I'll see what I can do, but would appreciate suggestions and revisions once I'm done.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 03:10, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Are you going to do that now? I just removed the quote from the Marcionite section, so it's back down to one paragraph, but still more about their schism than about their views of Jesus.

<p>Ebionite fact check: Did Ebionites view Jesus as the Messiah, or a potential Messiah? Also, are we talking about the Davidic Messiah, the Josephic Messiah, a fusion of the two (as in Christianity) or some other concept of <a href="../../../m/e/s/Messiah.html" title="Messiah">Messiah</a>?</p>
<p>I ask because I found the following paragraph in the <a href="../../../e/b/i/Ebionite.html" title="Ebionite">Ebionite</a> article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Ebionites emphasized the humanity of Jesus as the mortal son of Mary and Joseph, who was 'adopted' as a son of God when he was anointed with the Holy Spirit at his baptism, and therefore could have become the messianic king-priest of Israel (by virtue of also being both a descendant of king David through his father and a descendant of high priest Aaron through his mother) but was chosen to be the last and greatest of the prophets.</p>
</blockquote>

<dd>1. The common Ebionites, who were by far the more numerous, embodied the Pharisaic legalism, and were the proper successors of the Judaizers opposed in the Epistle to the Galatians. Their doctrine may be reduced to the following propositions:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(a) Jesus is, indeed, the promised Messiah, the son of David, and the supreme lawgiver, yet a mere man, like Moses and David, sprung by natural generation from Joseph and Mary. The sense of his Messianic calling first arose in him at his baptism by John, when a higher spirit joined itself to him. Hence, Origen compared this sect to the blind man in the Gospel, who called to the Lord, without seeing him: "Thou son of David, have mercy on me."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(b) Circumcision and the observance of the whole ritual law of Moses are necessary to salvation for all men.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(c) Paul is an apostate and heretic, and all his epistles are to be discarded. The sect considered him a native heathen, who came over to Judaism in later life from impure motives.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(d) Christ is soon to come again, to introduce the glorious millennial reign of the Messiah, with the earthly Jerusalem for its seat.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I believe a major issue here is that all we really have about a lot of these early sects are from Church Fathers writings about Heresies, sometimes contradicting each other (see Gospel of the Ebionites vs. The Gospel of the Hebrews vs. The Gospel of the Nazareans). There very well may have been Ebionites who didn't accept Jesus as the Jewish Messiah, but Ehrman and Schaff suggest otherwise, generally speaking.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 04:28, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Since you have the sources, you may need to edit and update <a href="../../../e/b/i/Ebionites.html" title="Ebionites">Ebionites</a>.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I know you are interested in christianity, and I recently started a new wiki over at wikicities which is on the subject of christianity. <a href="http://christianity.wikicities.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://christianity.wikicities.com/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> is the site.</p>
<p>The goal is to have a knowledgebase on christianity from a distinctly "C(hristian)POV" rather than the NPOV. It is not meant to be a mere Christian Encyclopedia, but to foster a real sense of community. I'd like to include things like current events, news, stories, and anything that would add to both an understanding of Christianity, but also its enjoyment. I'm looking for help to build a resource that could really enrich the lives of Christians.</p>
<p>I know you are busy but I am actively seeking new sysops/admins to help me build this site up, and I would be positively thrilled if you could contribute in any capacity whatsoever. <a href="../../../n/s/a/User%7ENsandwich_4afa.html" title="User:Nsandwich">nsandwich</a> 01:09, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Regarding my link to the Catholic Encyclopedia which you summarily deleted: The date being 1911 or 2006 is irrelevant- this is a question that spans 19 centuries, and there have been no recent developments in the case that I have read about in the news. So the teachings of the Catholic Church have no relevance to the dating of their canonical books? Thank you for deciding the issue for the rest of us.--josephconklin 28 March 2006</p>

<p>I'll grant that Vaticanus is debatable, however the large full page miniature of Ezra the Scribe in Amiatinus makes it, in my mind, an illuminated manuscript (see image <a href="../../../c/o/d/Image%7ECodxAmiatinusFolio5rEzra.jpg_8dca.html" title="Image:CodxAmiatinusFolio5rEzra.jpg">here</a>). <a href="../../../c/o/d/Image%7ECodex_Vaticanus_B%2C_2Thess._3%2C11-18%2C_Hebr._1%2C1-2%2C2.jpg_61c9.html" title="Image:Codex Vaticanus B, 2Thess. 3,11-18, Hebr. 1,1-2,2.jpg">This</a> image, with the enlarged and decorated initial and the green bar decorated with the three crosses to indicate the start of Hebrews pushed it into the illuminated column for me. Others may vary, but I see this as one of the early steps in marking divisions of the text with decoration that lead to the fully decorated text of the Insular manuscripts and all that followed them. <a href="../../../d/s/m/User%7EDsmdgold_7663.html" title="User:Dsmdgold">Dsmdgold</a> 02:48, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It would be a bit redundant to have both since illuminated manuscripts is a sub-cat of manuscripts, and it would be my inclination just to have illuminated. But the Earth probably won't come to an end if we have both. <a href="../../../d/s/m/User%7EDsmdgold_7663.html" title="User:Dsmdgold">Dsmdgold</a> 02:59, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Rhetoric or reality?</span></h3>
<p>My rhetoric ("abortion rights has now come to mean that a pregnant woman has a right to a dead fetus if the child is not wanted") is not as off the mark as you may think. I am simply repeating what a prominent well-respected abortionists has himself stated:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>"[T]he abortion patient has a right not only to be rid of the growth, called a fetus, in her body, but also has <b>a right to a dead fetus</b>. . . [I] never have any intention of trying to protect the fetus, if it can be saved. . . as a general principle [t]here should not be a live fetus."</i> - <b>Dr. Robert Crist, abortion doctor, testifying in federal court in 1980</b></li>

<p>Thank you for pointing out the 3RR rule to me. You are, of course, correct that I overstepped a rule of Wikipedia. Being aware of it now, I will try to be more careful in the future.</p>
<p>In regard to the Christian views of Jesus page, I'm not sure how much of a middle ground can be reached. If a topic that is not a Christian view of Jesus is pasted in, it is pretty much inappropriate by definition. I try to be respectful of others. I don't go into the Jewish view of Jesus site and make changes or impose a Christian viewpoint. It doesn't matter if I agree or disagree with the content posted there; it's Jewish views and I have no place in telling Jews how to think or what the Christian view is in a site called Jewish views of Jesus. I would hope this same courtesy would be extended to Christian views of Jesus. That it is not, is certainly unfortunate.</p>
<p>You have stated my disclaimer at the top of the page is against the MOS. Please provide more information. It appeared to be an appropriate addition based on word choice, but I am certainly willing to listen to your thoughts and knowledge.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Edit Wars Matthew and Luke</span></h2>
<p>I feel I have tried to do my best to retain as much of the information that you have presented as I felt I could. I understand our viewpoints on what is worthy may not agree. I think you'll agree I didn't just revert several layers of posts wiping out important factual information as was done recently by others in Luke. (Including information that you had entered.)</p>
<p>What information do you feel was removed unfairly? You are probably in a better position to tell me than I would be to find it.</p>
<p>Personally I feel you have probably received a pretty good picture of my views from the talk page on Matthew. I would like to see the articles be as factual as possible. I do not believe that straight facts without opinion should be edited unless they are off topic or rambling. I try to listen to your concerns and sometimes even go back and edit my work in ways that I think will be more harmonious. I'm not a big fan of the need to label majority and minority views, especially without a common understanding of how those numbers are arrived at, but then you are probably already aware of this. I'm also not a big fan of quoting cute comments from writers apart from factual information. We can all add in witty sayings from sources, but how does that help to truly discuss the Gospel of Luke or Matthew?</p>
<p>It has seemed to me that you are following me. If I post to a different topic than the one where we have had our discussion, suddenly you are there altering or removing my edits. Part of this is probably my fault. I had intended to start with Matthew and move to Luke followed by Mark and John. When I moved to Luke and made my first series of edits, I didn't realize until after I saved the work that you were the preceding user. Under the circumstances, I would have waited for more alterations to be made before first posting. This may have created consternation in you that I didn't didn't mean to occur. I apologize for that.</p>
<p>I hope this is a good starting point for discussion. I am always available to listen to your views or concerns.</p>

<p>Our previous discussion was limited to the Matthew board, and I did respond to all inquiries or thoughts. You didn't talk to me about Luke, but did go to other sites to tell people you were having difficulty with me. I thought it would be best to communicate with you directly. I have been reluctant, especially with Luke because the talk section has been so small, to monopolize or fill a board with a large volume of discussion when misunderstands, or, especially on boards where there is no human contact, hard feelings could be involved that could be soothed first on a personal level. I'm not sure, when all is said and done, that our viewpoints are going to be worth the amount of space that we take up on those talk areas.</p>

<p>Am I supposed to reply to you here, or on my talk page? Sorry, new to this.</p>
<p>I didn't read the cited article. It just didn't make sense to remove the brain if it doesn't make the skull any smaller. I'm not sure where one would look to support one side or the other. My experience has been that every article on abortion is pretty much slanted to one point-of-view or another (and that includes allegedly-neutral sites like WebMD)</p>
<p>So... I guess it was forward of me to make the edit, as I really don't know for sure, but on the other hand I can't prove that it doesn't, either.</p>
<p>Perhaps someone who has a better understanding of the procedure will review it. <a href="../../../x/x/x/User%7EXxxyyyzzz_bb86.html" title="User:Xxxyyyzzz">xxxyyyzzz</a> 21:59, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Andrew. You and I have encountered one another on talk pages for various abortion-related articles. I thought your input may be of use on the <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortifacient.html" title="Abortifacient">abortifacient</a> article. Someone recently removed the whole section on drugs and other devices which prevent implantation. I think it should be there, but I could use some support. Anyway, thanks ahead of time for taking a look. <small><span style="white-space: nowrap" class="plainlinks"><span style="border-left: 0px #505050 solid; border-right: 1px #505050 solid; color: #505050; background: #FFCCFF; font-weight: bold; font-variant: small-caps; font-size: 90%; line-height: 80%" class="nounderlinelink"><a href="../../../m/a/m/User%7EMamaGeek_2ede.html" title="User:MamaGeek"><span style="color: #505050">MamaGeek</span></a> </span><span style="border-right: 1px #505050 solid; color: #505050; background: #ffffa0"> <a href="../../../m/a/m/User_talk%7EMamaGeek_3208.html" title="User talk:MamaGeek"><span style="color: #505050">TALK</span></a> </span><span style="background: #a0ffa0"> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MamaGeek_df5e.html" title="Special:Contributions/MamaGeek"><span style="color: #505050">CONTRIB</span></a> </span></span></small> 13:31, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, I am aware of Bibleverse, Bibleref, niv, wikisource, and one or two others. The slight problem is that none of these are supported on standalone copies of WP or paper copies, nor can we rely on them to always be there. I am also aware of the heateed discussions about bible verse articles. I also think a user is entitled to expect the text (a text) of a bible verse, plus some information about it if they look it up on WP. I am planning on writing a modest proposal, in the next few weeks, to try to solve some of these problems. This exercise is a warm up for that, as much as anything. Incidentally I have just read the article <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_apocrypha_b74e.html" title="New Testament apocrypha">New Testament apocrypha</a>, and am amazed at how much more there is to know about the early church. <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_93a5.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough">Farmbrough</a></i> 17:41 <a href="../../../6/_/j/6_June_8cd3.html" title="6 June">6 June</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (UTC).</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">George Tiller</span></h2>
<p>The article is of very low quality and quite POV. More to the point, it's not even clear that it should exist. As far as I can tell, Tiller is not notable. So either the article should be deleted outright or cut down to a stub. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus"><font color="darkcyan">Al</font></a> 20:56, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm in agreement with Al. In addition to being badly-formatted, and of dubious notability, the article reads as utter hearsay. Its almost complete dependence upon the non-specific citation of pro-life organizations is especially problematic. If notability could be established, reliable sources found, and the critical tone neutralized, perhaps a good article could be made. -<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevera_1173.html" title="User:Severa">Severa</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/v/User_talk%7ESevera_b631.html" title="User talk:Severa">!!!</a>) 23:02, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>re you offer to create the templates - Awwwl :-( , well ok then :-) Having just been shown how to use optional parameters on <a href="../../../d/r/u/Template%7EDrugbox_2667.html" title="Template:Drugbox">template:drugbox</a>, i had been looking forward myself to such coding (quite aside from whether anyone agrees it would be a good idea or not) !  :-)</p>
<p>Being more serious, if you are experienced at such things, then I would welcome your guidence to further my proficiency at template table markup &amp; design. But I think we need quite a lot/reasonable consensus as to the idea and the required elements before what will be a major change to the structure of quite a lot of dearly-held articles. Recent tussle over NFP &amp; NBC seems to have been triggered by my creation of <a href="../../../b/i/r/Template%7EBirthControl_811f.html" title="Template:BirthControl">template:BirthControl</a> and the discussion of how this should be ordered. So I'm inclined to sit back a few days and let other issues get resolved whilst we see how this proposal is received....(?)

<p><br />
I've tried to make this live with added conditional testing (as works with <a href="../../../d/r/u/Template%7EDrugbox_2667.html" title="Template:Drugbox">Template:Drugbox</a>), but I seem to have 2 problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>Getting optional captions to display and more importantly</li>
<li>For optional paramters whose row should not be shown at all if undefined, a blank line is still appearing. See <a href="../../../b/i/r/Template_talk%7EBirthControl_infobox_0e7a.html" title="Template talk:BirthControl infobox">Template talk:BirthControl infobox</a> where I show the problems as related to an example mark-up for condoms</li>

<dd>Thanks for the reply. The edits didn't upset me, and I'm sorry if I gave the impression that they did. I only asked out of curiosity and the desire that you not spend time on pointless changes that could be spent on useful edits. It looks like the vast majority of your changes were indeed useful. The change wasn't problematic; I didn't revert it and wouldn't ask you to do so.
