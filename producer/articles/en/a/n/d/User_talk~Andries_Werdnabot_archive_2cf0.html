<p>Hi Andries, I shortened the quote from Schonborn and added the following to the cult response part of the article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>As regards former members, Dr. Introvigne, in his presentation to the <i>Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe and the House International Relations Committee</i> in Washington DC, states that disgruntled former members who dramatically reverses their loyalties "are but a minority of the larger population of ex-members of any given religious minority, and should not, without further investigation, be considered as representative of ex-members in general." <a href="http://www.cesnur.org/testi/Washington2.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cesnur.org/testi/Washington2.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Cardinal Schönborn states: "It is, however, unjustified, to present personal difficulties within a community as if they were a general experience."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Kindly check if you think it is fitting and fine with you. At least, this statement no longer generalizes on the "unreliability" of apostate testimony. It merely states that these testimonies are not representative of ex-members in general. This is an echo of the Schonborn statement from the sociological point of view. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarax_3983.html" title="User:Marax">Marax</a> 04:11, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Andries, I changed your "merge from" tag to simply a "merge" tag. I would say both names <i>Sergei Torop</i> and <i>Vissarion</i> are equally known.

<li>Your first one: Adherents of Opus Dei point in response to the accusations to the fact that several sociologists and religious scholars, like Wilson, treat the testimonies of critical former members with skepticism.

<ul>
<li>Irmgard's (which you ok'd): Sociologist Bryan R Wilson discredits reports of former members as [apostates testimony], a view which is disputed among scholars and sociologists. See Apostates#Opinions about the reliability of apostates' testimony and their motivations.</li>

Wilson, a scientist admired by scholars world-wide but also opposed by some others, studied the phenomenon of a type of adult former members who "shows himself to have been first a victim" then "a redeemed crusader" and "whose personal history predisposes him to bias." Wilson states: "the suspicion must arise that he acts from a personal motivation to vindicate himself and to regain his self-esteem." These, he says, "learn to rehearse an atrocity story,"</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Your latest version: Some prominent sociologists advocate in general skepticism towards the testimonies of critical former members of controversial religious movements while other sociologists disagree. See Controversy about the validity of the testimonies of critical members of religious movements</li>
</ul>
<p>My latest proposal: While the topic of the validity of testimonies of former members of religious organizations is controversial, some prominent sociologists like Reader Emeritus of Sociology of the University of Oxford, Bryan R. Wilson, puts in doubt the testimonies of a type of critical former members. Wilson goes so far as to say, for example, that some of these adult members who are "prone to bias" sometimes "learn to rehearse an atrocity story." See Controversy about the validity of the testimonies of critical members of religious movements</p>
<p>My proposal tries to put together proposals. I think that Thomas' attempt to provide a quote is ok given the NPOV policy:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Disagreements over whether something is approached the Neutral Point Of View (NPOV) way can usually be avoided through the practice of good research. Facts (as defined in the previous paragraph) are not Points Of View (POV, here used in the meaning of "opposite of NPOV") in and of themselves. A good way to help building a neutral point of view is to find a <i>reputable source</i> for the piece of information you want to add to wikipedia, and then <i>cite that source.</i> This is <i>an easy way to characterize a side of a debate without excluding that the debate has other sides.</i> The trick is to <i>find the best and most reputable sources</i> you can. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view#A_vital_component:_good_research" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view#A_vital_component:_good_research" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Although I do agree that the quote has to put in proper context and nuance as you said in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Opus_Dei/Archive_2005-3#Zablocki_and_Duheim_to_criticism_and_Introvigne_to_response" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Opus_Dei/Archive_2005-3#Zablocki_and_Duheim_to_criticism_and_Introvigne_to_response" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>: that Wilson although prominent and a very "reputable source" is quite extreme. Thus, my rendering: "he goes so far as to say."</p>
<p>I placed "put in doubt" rather than "generally advocates skepticism" because he specifies the type. He does not advocate skepticism for all apostates. There is more nuance in his statements, I think.</p>

<p>There is already an <b>official Wikipedia policy</b> about sources: <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiability_beed.html" title="WP:Verifiability">WP:Verifiability</a>: I quote:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Because this is the English Wikipedia, English-language sources should be given whenever possible, and should always be used in preference to foreign-language sources. For example, do not use a foreign-language newspaper as a source unless there is no equivalent article in an English-language newspaper.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In cases where the original source material is not in English, and there is no English-language equivalent, there is a tension between accessibility and verifiability. Readers may not be able to read source materials in other languages, and therefore require translations into English so that they can read them. Editors need this too, so they can check that the source has been used correctly.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However, translations are subject to error, whether performed by a Wikipedia editor or a professional, published translator. Readers have to be able to verify for themselves what the original material actually said, that it was published by a credible source, and that it was translated correctly.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Therefore, when the original material is in a language other than English:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Where sources are directly quoted, published translations are preferred over editors performing their own translations directly.</li>
<li>Where editors use their own English translation of a non-English source as a quote in an article, they should include next to it the original-language quotation, so that readers can check what the original source said and the accuracy of the translation.</li>
<li>The original source in the original language should be cited, so that readers and editors can evaluate the reliability and credibility of the original source, can determine whether the original source was peer reviewed, and can verify that the article content is supported by the source material.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>So, non-English sources are OK, within these parameters. If you want to change that official policy, the best way to do this is at <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia_talk%7EVerifiability_44f5.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Verifiability">Wikipedia_talk:Verifiability</a> <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 03:37, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, Thank you for accepting me as a mediator on a trial basis. The other two editors have already raised a number of issues about which they have concerns. It would be helpful if you started a section on the mediation page which expresses some of the things you hope might come out of mediation. If you don't feel inclined to express your hopes for mediation, that is OK too, but in that case please let me know that it is OK to proceed without a statement from you. Thanks again. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> 15:08, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi, I added the following comment to mediation page. I am repeating it here, because I did some major reorganization, and I don't want this to get overlooked in the shuffle.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I am more interested in the answers to the two questions than I am in arguments that might be raised to support the particular numbers chosen. I am at fault for conveying the impression that I am more interested in the arguments which support those numbers than is the case at the moment. I think the arguments are important, but I really want to see the numbers soon, even if they are high and low limits that you have chosen merely because your gut says they are OK.</dd>

<dd>Hi again, Andries. Here is an initial response to your note:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>a) Wikipedia says we should report <i>in proportion to the credibility of the expert.</i> I think it is almost beyond dispute that Wilson is one of the most credible experts on this topic (0pus Dei is under the category of religious organization). Duheim and Zablocki could be mentioned only if their credibility is proportionate to Wilson, and if there are no limitations of space and due proportionality. But their position is not altogether absent in the article. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_L._Allen%2C_Jr._a5e4.html" title="John L. Allen, Jr.">John L. Allen, Jr.</a>, another highly credible writer, says that the differences in interpreting the same religious data "depends on one's basic approach to a religious vocation, family life, etc.". And in terms of space proportions, Allen's space is greater than Wilson's. b) General scientific statements of an expert in a field which has greater extension, and by the very philosophical definition of extension, general and science, could be applied to specifics. This is done in these specific subjects, as to Keynesian economics <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Keynesian_economics" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Keynesian_economics" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>, John Dewey <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=John_Dewey" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=John_Dewey" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>. I am sure these experts did not specifically refer to these subjects but their theories are applied to them, because they meant their general scientific statements to be inductions from specifics and later applied to other specifics. c) I read Wilson's paper (but it was not from Scientology but from a human rights or freedom group). Wilson does not brand all defectors as producers of atrocity stories. It is only specific individuals who are. And I am sure you are not one of them. But I think it is important that the people learn from a world expert about these type of individuals, who are few but destructive. It will also protect you and me, if somebody who leaves Wikipedia, for example, one day portray us in a very bad light.</p>

<dd>Did you know that Kranenborg wrote in 2002 that after the family rift, Maharaji continued independently, abandoned the divine trappings and claims about himself and began to present himself instead an humanitarian leader? Source: Kranenborg, Reender "Neohindoeïstische bewegingen in Nederland&#160;: een encyclopedisch overzicht", Kampen Kok cop. (2002), p.178 <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 9043504939</a>. "Zij [Mata Ji, Prem Rawat moeder] onterfde hem spiritueel, in feite werd hij de beweging uitgezet. Maharaji ging zelfstandig verder, zij het met minder pretenties dan voorheen. Zo sprak hij sindsdien niet meer in goddelijke termen over zichzelf, maar noemde zich 'humanitarian leader'" (translation: "She [Rawat's mother, Mata ji] disinherited him spiritually. In fact, he was expelled from the movement. Maharaji continued on independently, with less claims than in the past, not speaking with divine terms about himself, but calling himself instead an 'humanitarian leader'"</dd>

<dd>So, did you manage to confirm this? The email stated that it was you that posted this reference in the former followers chatroom. If that is the case, then I am surprised that you chose not provide that information in the article itself. I am giving you the benefit of the doubt, because I do not believe that you would forward only these cites from Kranenborg that support your POV, and hiding others that don't, and then accuse fellow editors of double-standards. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 22:45, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Andries, I noticed you said my page contained <i>"defamatory"</i> content. Are you aware of the definition of <i>"defamation"</i>? If statements are negative, but <b>true</b>, that is not defamation. If statements are untrue, then it is defamation. Point out anything on my page about you that is untrue, i.e., "defamatory".

<p>Hi Andries. I'm sure you read the contributions of SSS108 and perhaps have my talk page on your watch list. So, it is not really necessary for me to tell you that SSS108 is considering filing a request for arbitration against you. I have noticed that your recent edits on SSB seem to be mostly in the right direction. I'm reluctant to put pressure on people when they seem to be trying to do the right thing. However, to be honest, there are several things that I would have brought to your attention eventually, and the fact that SSS108 is considering arbitration makes it seem appropriate to bring them up now, despite your recent good edits.</p>
<p>I have been somewhat disappointed that you have been so slow in responding to comments that I have made directly addressed to you. In the event that mediation continues, I hope that you will try to keep in touch more frequently.</p>
<p>There is a larger issue, however, that I would like to share my feelings about. I would like you to reconsider the answers that you gave to the questions about Premanand's article about inappropriate influence upon the judiciary. Neutral point of view is an a basic policy of Wikipedia. Good editors must be able to distinguish partisanship from a neutral point of view. The ability to recognize what constitutes credible evidence that a crime has been committed from cases where no such credible evidence has been presented, and the ability to recognize when authors are hiding insinuations by phrasing them as questions, these abilities are basic and essential for distinguishing a partisan source from a neutral source. There may be other editors who share your opinions of the Premanand article. However, I think a great many editors would take your answers as a sign of an inability to properly judge sources.

<p>Welkom bij de club der rouwenden', e-mailt ex-Sai Baba-devotee (vereerder) Leo, aan nieuwe lotgenoten. Hij wil zijn naam niet in de krant. ,,Voor mij is het nu een week dat ik ex ben, en dat na elf jaar. Naar aanleiding van alle geruchten die hij hoorde, nam hij ondanks Sai Baba's verbod een kijkje op internet. ,,Schokkend was het. Ik kon het niet meer afdoen als een complot van negatieve krachten en teleurgestelde devotees. Hij is nu in de rouw. ,,Baba was niet alleen mijn vader en moeder maar ook de grondlegger van mijn wereldbeeld. Ik heb al zijn foto's verscheurd.</p>

"It has now been a week for me that I am an ex, and that after eleven years. Because of all the rumors that he heard and in spite of Sai Baba's prohibition, he took a look at the internet. "It was shocking. I could not dismiss it anymore as a conspiracy of negative forces and disappointed devotees. He is now mourning. "Baba was not only my father and mother but also the founder of my world view. I tore up all his pictures.</p>

<p>Honderden Nederlandse gelovigen hebben net als hij de afgelopen maanden hun Sai Baba-foto's van de muren gescheurd en zijn boeken weggegooid. Het aantal getuigenissen op internet groeit, van gewone aanhangers, maar ook van 'hooggeplaatsten' die Sai Baba goed kennen. Steevast trok de swami hun broek omlaag en betastte hun geslachtsdelen. Sommigen werden gedwongen tot orale seks. Wie Sai Baba onder vier ogen mag ontmoeten is een geluksvogel. Duizenden moeten genoegen nemen met de vluchtige aanblik van de godheid wanneer hij de zegen geeft.</p>
<p>(ENGLISH TRANSLATION HERE): Hundreds of Dutch believers have, just like him torn their Sai Baba pictures off the wall and threw away his books. The number of testimonies on the internet is growing, from rank and file adherents, but also from 'highly placed persons' who know Sai Baba well. Invariably the swami pulled their trousers down and felt up their genitals. Some were forced to oral sex. Whom can meet Sai Baba in private is a lucky one. Thousands have to be satisfied with a brief sight of the deity when he gives the blessing.</p>

<p>De mythisch-sociologische connectie tussen Sai Baba en de god Shiva is hiermee voor een belangrijk deel uitgelegd. Rest de erotische component van Shiva in relatie te brengen met Sai Baba. Swallow wijst o.m. op Sai Baba's artistieke verschijning in het verleden (Baba danste en zong) en zijn uiterlijk. Baba's voorkomen vertoont eerder vrouwelijke dan mannelijke trekken, en zijn uitstraling is een mengeling van erotiek en ascetisme. Over de wijze waarop Sai Baba het nieuwe tijdperk in gang zal zetten, meent Swallow dat Sathya Sai Baba dit middels eigen rituelen doet, maar dat daarbij "de sexuele beeldspraak verborgen is en aangepast is aan de gevoeligheden van zijn vrij preutse toehoorders."</p>
<p>(ENGLISH TRANSLATION HERE):The mythical-sociological relation between Sai Baba and the deity Shiva has been explained with this to a great extent. What remains is to relate the erotic component of Shiva to Sai Baba. Swallow points among others at Sai Baba artistic figure in the past (Baba danced and sang) and his looks. Baba's appearance shows more female than male traits, and his aura is a mix of eroticism and asceticism. With regards to the way by which Sai Baba will get the new age going, Swallow holds the opinion that he will do this through his own rituals, but that in addition "the sexual metaphors are hidden and adapted to the sensitivities of his rather prudish listeners."</p>

<hr />
<p>Middels deze laatste opmerking wordt aannemelijk waarom Sai Baba's sexuele handelingen zoals Brooke en Ord ze naar voren hebben gebracht, grotendeels onder de oppervlakte zijn gebleven: het merendeel van zijn devotees is niet open genoeg om de symboliek te kunnen begrijpen of te accepteren. Totaal onduidelijk is evenwel of Swallow kennis heeft genomen van Sai Baba's handelingen met jongemannen en zijn tweeslachtigheid. Uit de wijze waarop zij Baba als een incarnatie van Shiva heeft geportretteerd, zou afgeleid kunnen worden dat ze het niet meer dan normaal of passend zou vinden dat die gebeurtenissen plaatsvinden. Want Baba toont in de privé-omgeving zijn kant van 'opperste geliefde' en combineert dit bovendien met Shiva-Shakti, de man-vrouw vorm. Baba is letterlijk de levende lingam in de yoni. Aan de buitenwereld toont Baba zijn andere kant, die van 'asceet', van de goeroe die sexualiteit als een functioneel gebeuren uitlegt om als soort te blijven voortbestaan.</p>
<p>(ENGLISH TRANSLATION HERE): With this last remark it becomes plausible why Sai Baba's sexual acts, as Brooke and Ord told them, have been largely remained under the surface: the majority of the devotees is not open enough to understand the symbolism or to accept it. It is totally unclear whether Swallow knew about Sai Baba's acts with young men and his hermaphrodism. From the way in which she portrayed Baba as an incarnation of Shiva, one could infer that she would have found it normal and appropriate that those events take place. Because Baba shows in his private surroundings his side of the 'supreme lover' and in addition combines this with Shiva-Shakti, the male-female form. Baba is literally the living lingam in the yoni. To the outside world Baba shows his other side, that of the 'ascetic', of the guru who explains sexuality as a functional thing to persist as a species.</p>

<p>Bij elk nieuw stuk kwam een net iets ander aspect met betrekking tot de goeroe naar voren. Vroon verwees bijv. naar de Indiër Basava Premanand, die al jaren druk doende is Sai Baba te ontmaskeren als avatar. Twee dagen na het verschijnen van de IKON-documentaire vertelde Premanand in het praatprogramma van Karel de Graaf, dat Baba betrokken is bij duistere praktijken als goud- en juwelensmokkel en belastingontduiking.</p>
<p>(ENGLISH TRANSLATION HERE): With each new piece a slightly different apect with regards to the guru emerged. For example, Vroon referred to the Indian Basava Premanand who has been busy for years to expose Sai Baba as an avatar. Two days after the appearance of the IKON documentary Premanand told in the talk show of Karel de Graaf that Baba is involved in shady affairs, such as gold and jewellery smuggling and tax evasion.</p>

<p>Na dit Gurupurnima festival steeg Sai Baba's aanzien en bekendheid verder. Tempels werden voor hem gebouwd in Bombay, Hyderabad en Madras. Er trokken Engelsen, Australiërs en Amerikanen naar hem toe. De boeken die van hen over Baba verschenen zorgden tezamen met Baba's reis naar Oost-Afrika ervoor dat hij mondiaal gezien naam begon te maken. En nog altijd lijkt het aantal mensen dat naar hem toegaat toe te nemen. De schatting van de huidige omvang volgelingen, veelal 'devotees' genoemd, loopt flink uiteen.23 Ruwweg wordt het geschat op 50 miljoen, uit allerlei lagen van de bevolking en verdeeld over de hele wereld, doch het merendeel afkomstig uit India zelf. Het Nederlandse Sathya Sai Baba Nieuws heeft een oplage van circa 2800 bladen; in alle grote steden in ons land worden Sai Baba-erediensten en studie-bijeenkomsten gehouden en jaarlijks reizen groepen naar Puttaparthi om een poos in zijn ashram te verblijven.</p>
<p>(ENGLISH TRANSLATION HERE): After this gurupurnima festival Sai Baba's standing and reputation increased further. Temples were built for him in Bombay, Hyderabad, and Madras. English, Australians, and Americans went to him. The books that appeared by them about Baba led, together with Baba's journey to East-Africa to a world wide reputation. And the number of people that goes to him still seems to increase. The estimate of the current size of his followers, who are often called 'devotees', vary quite a lot. 23 Roughly it is estimated at 50 million from all layers of sociey and dispersed over the whole world, though the majority from India itself. The Dutch Sathya Sai Baba Nieuws has a circulation of 2,800 magazines: in all big cities in our country Sai Baba services and study circles are held and yearly groups travel to Puttaparthi to stay some time in his ashram.</p>

<p>In feite zijn de visies pro-, anti- en neutraal-Baba door de publiciteit meer gemeengoed geworden. De tegenstrijdigheden van en rondom Baba zijn extremer aan het licht gekomen, want in wezen bestonden ze voordien ook al, zij het meer gevoelsmatig. Degenen die niet in wonderen of iets dergelijks geloven, trokken bij voorbaat Baba's kunsten in twijfel, maar hebben nu troeven in handen gekregen in de vorm van daadwerkelijke bewijzen en namen van mensen die Baba's bedrog trachten aan te tonen.</p>
<p>(ENGLISH TRANSLATION HERE): In fact, the views pro-, anti-, and neutral-Baba have become more common by the publicity. The contradictions of and about Baba have emerged more extreme, because they were already there in essence, though more instinctively. Whoever does not believe in miracles or something similar questioned Baba's tricks in advance, but they are now supported in the form real proofs and names of people who try to prove Baba's fraud.</p>

<p>Alexandra (30) heeft haar bedenkingen, maar ze zou het vervelend vinden wanneer haar ervaringen alleen maar negatief zouden worden uitgelegd. Aarzelend komt het er uit: in '89 was zij drie maanden in de ashram van Sai Baba. Zij kwam er ook onder de indruk wat zij daar meemaakte en voelde zich zelfs een devotee worden. Maar uiteindelijk ging zij er geheel in de war vandaan en had zij enige tijd nodig om haar evenwicht te hervinden. Hoewel zij het niet graag vertelt vindt ze ook dat ze niets te verbergen heeft: een vriend met wie zij in de ashram is opgetrokken heeft heel vreemde ervaringen opgedaan met de godmens. Ja, inderdaad, op seksueel gebied. We kunnen het hem beter zelf vragen.</p>
<p>(ENGLISH TRANSLATION HERE): Alexandra (30) has her objections, but would be unhappy if her experiences would only be explained in a negative way. Hesitant she tells her story: in '89 she was three months in the ashram of Sai Baba. She became impressed by what she experienced there and she even felt that she became a devotee. But finally she went away totally confused and she needed some time to find back her balance. Although she does not like to tell so, she also thinks that she has nothing to hide: a friend with whom she was associated in the ashram has had very strange experiences with the godman. Yes, indeed, related to sexuality. We had better ask him himself.</p>

<p>Keith, (26), vertelt dat Sai Baba hem zei, toen hij was uitverkoren voor een persoonlijke ontmoeting, dat hij teveel aan de meisjes dacht. Maar op een volgende gelegenheid ging Baba verder. "Onverhoeds trok hij mijn broek naar beneden en probeerde hij mij seksueel op te winden. Hij nam mijn hand en legde het op zijn geslachtsorgaan. Toen merkte ik dat Sai Baba tweeslachtig was: niet dat hij half-vrouw half-man was, geen hermafrodiet, nee, van het ene ogenblik op het andere veranderde hij van man in vrouw, compleet met de geslachtsorganen die daarbij horen. Vraag me niet hoe dat kan, maar ik heb het zo ervaren. Het moet ook een soort wonder zijn. Kennelijk leeft Sai Baba toch op een ander niveau dan gewone stervelingen." Dit is wat Keith Ord ons vertelt en wij geven het maar door.</p>
<p>(ENGLISH TRANSLATION HERE): Keith, (26), tells that when he had been chosen for a personal meeting, Sai Baba said to him that he thought too much about girls. But on a next occasion Baba went further. "Suddenly he pulled down my trousers and he tried to excite me sexually. He took my hand and put it on his genitals. Then I noticed that Sai Baba was a hermaphrodite: not that he was half-female half-male, not a hermaphrodite, no, from one moment on the other he changed from male into female, completely with the genitals that belong to it. Do not ask me how this is possible, but I have experienced it this way. It must be some sort of miracle too. Obviously Sai Baba still lives at a another level than mere mortals." This is what Keith Ord tells us and we only convey what he said.</p>

<p>Keith Ord: "Toen Baba mijn ontsteltenis zag zei hij dat ik niet hoefde te schrikken, want dat ook dit goddelijk was. In grote verwarring ben ik toen naar mijn kamer teruggegaan. Het heeft drie weken geduurd voordat ik er met enkele vrienden die ik daar had ontmoet, onder wie Alexandra, over durfde te praten. Een van de vrienden vertrok na mijn verhaal hals over de kop: hij had exact hetzelfde meegemaakt, inclusief de opmerking van Baba dat dit goddelijk was." Keith ging op onderzoek uit en kreeg van een tiental mannen en jongens te horen dat zij erover konden meepraten. Ze hadden het aanvaard vanuit de gedachte dat ook een godmens niets menselijks vreemd hoeft te zijn, inclusief seksualiteit.</p>
<p>(ENGLISH TRANSLATION HERE): Keith Ord: "When Baba saw my dismay he said that I should not be frightened, because this was divine too. In great confusion I then went back to my room anyway. It took three weeks before I dared to talk about it with some friends that I had met there, including Alexandra. One of my friends left after my story in a hurry; he had experienced exactly the same, including the remark by Baba that this was divine." Keith then started to investigate matters and heard from about ten men and boys that they knew a thing or two about it. They had accepted it based on the thought that a godman can be a mere human too, including sexuality.</p>

<p>Maar zelf is Keith door die gebeurtenis wel uit het lood geslagen. Hij geloofde in Sai Baba, ook in het feit dat hier sprake was van een god in mensengedaante. En dan ineens die nogal agressieve, ongewenste seksuele intimiteit. Hij kon het niet rijmen, "Na enkele weken van innerlijke strijd heb ik met Sai Baba gebroken. Ik realiseer me dat hij huichelt. Hij predikt dat seks alleen mag dienen voor de voortplanting en dat al het andere energieverspilling is van energie en alleen maar de lagere instincten voedt. Dit is wat hij zegt, maar achter gesloten deuren doet hij dan zoiets. Hij spreekt met dubbele tong en dat kan niet voor een godmens. Bovendien maakt hij misbruik van zijn positie."</p>
<p>(ENGLISH TRANSLATION HERE): But Keith himself was thrown off his balance by this event. He had faith in Sai Baba, including in the fact that here we are talking about a god in human form. And then suddenly this aggressive undesired sexual intimacy. He could not reconcile it. "After some weeks of internal struggle I broke with Sai Baba. I realized that he behaves hypocritically. He preaches that sex should only be for procreation and that everything else is a waste of energy and only feeds the lower instincts. This is what he says, but behind closed doors, he does something like this. He speaks with a double tongue and this inappropriate for a godman. Apart from this, he abuses his position. "</p>

<p>Andries, I sincerely apologize for my absense from Wikipedia and the mediation process. Unfortunately, other obligations have been pressing me. I feel that this point I should state that I cannot promise a return to the process in any reasonable time frame, and I will have to suggest that the parties seek another mediator or some other means of dealing with the remaining issues. Although I believe that progress was made through the mediation, I also understand that the conflict has not been fully resolved, and I apologize for what feels to me as abandoning the parties. I wish it could be otherwise. Sincerely, --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> 16:16, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Andries,</p>
<p>I am fairly new to Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I received the following message from you: "<i>Please read the policies and guidelines for creating a new article, otherwise you may be creating another article that may be deleted. Andries 11:28, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</i></p>
<p><i>I do not mean to say that all books by or about Prabhupada have no place in Wikipedia. For example, I voted to keep the Bhagavad Gita As It Is which is a notable book. Andries 11:26, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</i>"</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>I created a page for the book Srila Prabhupada: The Prominent Link, because I feel that it adds a valid perspective on some of the issues associated with succession in the Hare Krishna movement.</p>
<p>I am not sure if it is the content of my page that is not okay, or if there is something in the wording that is not seen as ok.</p>
<p>More info on the book can be found here:</p>

<p>My goal is not to make an "advertisement" for the book, but rather to add information that I think is important for understand the issues of succession and initiation.--<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexandreJ_3096.html" title="User:AlexandreJ">AlexandreJ</a> 11:46, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Andries, thank you for the further clarification, and the information about Amazon ranking. For the Wikipedia Google test, is there an approximate minimum number of yielded results that would, in your view, be sufficient in this instance to strengthen the case for possible notability?--<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexandreJ_3096.html" title="User:AlexandreJ">AlexandreJ</a> 12:37, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Andries, if I modified the page in such a way that it would be about the Prominent Link (henceforth PL) model of initiation...the general paradigm...as opposed to specifically about the book Srila Prabhupada: The Prominent Link, would this make a stronger case for allowing the page to remain?--<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexandreJ_3096.html" title="User:AlexandreJ">AlexandreJ</a> 12:49, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Andries, thanks for your response. One of the reasons that I see the book as important, is that it provides an additional perspective on initiation/succession, rather than "Ritvik" vs. the ISKCON organization. The book also includes contributions from a number of persons who are, or were, in positions of prominence within the ISKCON organization. In addition to this, it is the first time that I have come across a major statement on initiation/succession in Srila Prabhupada's movement presented as exploratory rather than as supposedly conclusive.--<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexandreJ_3096.html" title="User:AlexandreJ">AlexandreJ</a> 16:13, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Based on my experience and observation of the followers Srila Prabhupada, over the past 10 years, issues and controversies related to initiation and succession seem to be one of the major sources of conflict. The book Srila Prabhupada: The Prominent Link seems to me to provide a different way of looking at a number of these issues. The book includes contributions from persons who are, or were at one time, in positions of prominence in the ISKCON organization. In my ten years of reading, it is the first time that I have seen a major statement on initiation/succession in the tradition of Srila Prabhupada presented as exploratory rather than as supposedly conclusive. I believe that being aware of the additional perspective that the book presents will allow readers to draw a more informed and complete understanding of the issues.--<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexandreJ_3096.html" title="User:AlexandreJ">AlexandreJ</a> 16:25, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dear Andries, the book <a href="../../../t/h/e/Srila_Prabhupada%7E_The_Prominent_Link_d597.html" title="Srila Prabhupada: The Prominent Link">Srila Prabhupada: The Prominent Link</a> (PL) has created substantial waves. The Governing Body Commission of ISKCON, directly and through it's Sastric Advisory Council (SAC), has devoted much energy to addressing it, including a major paper dealing with the issues raised in PL. The SAC's paper can be downloaded here:</dd>

<dd>There is an active, dynamic PL conference sparking much thought on issues of succession in Srila Prabhupada's movement. Thousands of persons associated with the ISKCON organization, and with other parts of Srila Prabhupada's movement, are affected by the ideas in PL.</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure who first suggested that the PL Wikipedia page be deleted. I'm not sure if it was you, or if it was someone else, perhaps a member of the ISKCON organization. I am open to the possibility that whoever first suggested that it be deleted was not doing it for any political reasons. Based on ten yeas of contact with the ISKCON organization, and based on my experience of how the leadership of the ISKCON organization has responded to the book, I am also open to the possibility that some devotees who post on Wikipedia might wish to silence the ideas presented in the PL book.--<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexandreJ_3096.html" title="User:AlexandreJ">AlexandreJ</a> 04:52, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Much energy is required by this ministry to combat the erroneous philosophy being presented by a person highly placed within ISKCON leadership. This is further compounded by the fact that Dhira Govinda widely conducts seminars which supposedly teach psychological and spiritual well-being but ultimately result in anti-ISKCON mentality among the students. One can observe the mood of Bhaktin Miriam as she publicly condemns the GBC for disapproving of The Prominent Link. And she is in charge of organizing Dhira Govinda's seminars in New York.</i>"</dd>

You wrote just what I’ve been thinking for many years.' Concurring with the statements of Ambarisa Prabhu and Balavanta Prabhu in the Foreword and Preface, many Vaisnavas emphasize the straightforward common sense of the concepts in PL."</i></dd>

<dd><i>"Ostensibly ISKCON wants innovative, thoughtful members who boldly apply their intelligence, within the framework of guru, sastra and sadhu, for gaining a deeper understanding of devotional principles. In practice, as experienced by many, if one does not conform to the organizational line on issues such as those addressed in PL, then the institutional leadership, without rational discussion or genuine attempt at understanding, often condemns the dissenter and discourages members of the organization to honestly look at issues from unorthodox perspectives. The implied message is 'We have already thoroughly considered these issues. So you needn’t apply your intelligence here, because we’ve thought it through for you.' Such a stance is unlikely to attract and retain independently thoughtful members. There is in the organization a veneer of broad-mindedness, accompanied by an implicit assertion that views such as those espoused in Srila Prabhupada: The Prominent Link are not to be found amongst persons in good-standing in the organization. If someone in the organization advocates such convictions, they are then branded and condemned, and pressured to leave the institution. Once they have left, it is again safe for the leadership to declare to the members that no one in good-standing would hold such views as expressed in essays such as The Prominent Link, and anyone who thinks that way is deviant, and so you’d do better to not even consider thinking in that way.</i></dd>

<dd><i>"Authoritarian dynamics, wherein the leadership is fearful of permitting subordinates to analyze and discern for themselves, may be somewhat prevalent in today’s religious institutions, but they are not conducive for Vaisnava society or relationships. Such reluctance to allow members to fully utilize their cognitive faculties may stem to a substantial degree from a benevolent desire to protect. The ISKCON organization may also benefit, however, from introspectively looking at other motivations for this authoritarianism, such as fear that members, upon analysis of facts from an alternative perspective, may realize that they are being, in some ways, misled.</i></dd>

<dd><i>"We understand that this imperious leadership style is not extant throughout the organization, but it is manifest with sufficient regularity and pervasiveness that many, perhaps most, of Srila Prabhupada’s followers, both inside and outside the institution, feel alienated and stifled. Thus, for the purpose of attracting and maintaining satisfied, intelligent members, it is, we believe, imperative for ISKCON leadership, especially at the top levels, to seriously assess its mode of addressing issues and concerns. As Balavanta writes in the Preface to PL, spiritual matters in Srila Prabhupäda’s society must be resolved through 'open and frank discussion amongst mature devotees whose voices are not suppressed.'</i></dd>

It is the opinion of many, including this author, that ISKCON needs to reexamine its paradigms, with fearless detachment, on issues including the guru issue, to avoid remaining a relatively insignificant cult, and to become a substantial player in the institutions of society at large. We understand that there are many fears, ranging from loss of important personal relationships to loss of legal battles, associated with implementation of the PL model. We contend with confidence that Srila Prabhupada’s movement possesses the strength to handle the challenges that will arise with the PL paradigm, and that the movement will undoubtedly be strengthened by accommodating and encouraging the PL model."</i> --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexandreJ_3096.html" title="User:AlexandreJ">AlexandreJ</a> 05:48, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I'm going to be mediating your case relating to the above article. First thing that we need to decide is what format the mediation should take. I would recommend carrying out the mediation on Wikipedia, specifically [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_mediation/Sathya_Sai_Baba_2|here" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_mediation/Sathya_Sai_Baba_2|here" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>]. If you have any objection to using Wikipedia, then please let me know. One other thing, if you plan to take a Wikibreak in the next week or so, or know that you will not be around much could you pleaes let me know. --<a href="../../../w/i/s/User%7EWisden17_7d7e.html" title="User:Wisden17">Wisd</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green"><b>e</b></font></a><a href="../../../w/i/s/User_talk%7EWisden17_883f.html" title="User talk:Wisden17">n17</a> 12:17, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well technically yes and no. The parties may reject the mediator but if it is a member of the MedCom then this can be taken as the mediation as having failed and the case can then be taken to RfAr. Obviously a mediation cannot take place if parties do not agree to the mediator. However, it is my understanding that no member of the MedCom has ever been rejected as a mediator in a case. You don't appear to have answered my initial question about what format you would like the mediation to take. Is Wikipedia ok for you? --<a href="../../../w/i/s/User%7EWisden17_7d7e.html" title="User:Wisden17">Wisd</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green"><b>e</b></font></a><a href="../../../w/i/s/User_talk%7EWisden17_883f.html" title="User talk:Wisden17">n17</a> 23:42, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I feel I need to explain my position a bit more as you appear not to understand my role. I am a member of the Mediation Committee and as such am an official mediator on Wikipedia. I am not filling the same role as a mediator who takes a mediation thorugh the Mediation Cabal, or who simply volunteers. With this in mind it is important to understand how the mediator's role in Wikipedia. Whilst you may not wish to have me as the mediator this will lead to a lengthening in what appears to have been a long-running issue. I hope I can work with you in bringing this matter to a state where both parties are happy with the outcome. If you need to contact me you may e-mail me as well as leaving a message on my talk page. --<a href="../../../w/i/s/User%7EWisden17_7d7e.html" title="User:Wisden17">Wisd</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green"><b>e</b></font></a><a href="../../../w/i/s/User_talk%7EWisden17_883f.html" title="User talk:Wisden17">n17</a> 23:22, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I much rather we waited until you've finished your wikibreak to begin the mediation. I shall ask Essjay to move to back to pending. If this is seen as a delaying tactic then the case may well be classed as having failed and a RfAr may be filled. --<a href="../../../w/i/s/User%7EWisden17_7d7e.html" title="User:Wisden17">Wisd</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green"><b>e</b></font></a><a href="../../../w/i/s/User_talk%7EWisden17_883f.html" title="User talk:Wisden17">n17</a> 22:31, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Can you clarify two things:a) how long will you be on a wikibreak, and b) what is the nature of this wikibreak as you appear to still be editing? --<a href="../../../w/i/s/User%7EWisden17_7d7e.html" title="User:Wisden17">Wisd</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green"><b>e</b></font></a><a href="../../../w/i/s/User_talk%7EWisden17_883f.html" title="User talk:Wisden17">n17</a> 16:50, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wisden17, it is abundantly clear that Andries is <b>not</b> interested or dedicated to the mediation process despite his former commitment to participate in mediation (he even signed the request within a few minutes of its submission: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_mediation&amp;diff=55315305&amp;oldid=55314516" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_mediation&amp;diff=55315305&amp;oldid=55314516" rel="nofollow">Reference</a>). Although Andries was willing to agree to mediation, he is now <b>refusing</b> to state whether or not he accepts you as a mediator and <b>refuses</b> to state why he is <b>not</b> giving an answer. Now Andries is claiming that he does want to contribute his time to mediation and is on a wikibreak. Wisden17, you <b>specifically</b> asked both parties (Andries and myself) to inform you if either of us were going on wikibreak and Andries did <b>not</b> give you an answer. Now, however, after repeatedly asking Andries to give an answer regarding mediation, he is claiming he is on wikibreak. From the 16th (when you informed Andries that you were the mediator) to today, Andries has made no less than 76 edits (mostly on the <i>Guru</i> and <i>Sathya Sai Baba</i> articles) and refuses to answer why he won't accept you as a mediator. I think this type of behavior proves that Andries is not committed to mediation and I would like for you to inform me how to proceed with arbitration.

<dd>I think your "type of behavior," SSS108 is controlling and out of line. You don't get to make demands on people just because you feel like it. Who died and left you boss of the article? What's with you Wikipedians, anyway? You browbeat someone like Andries, who is always civil and polite, and then you further set forth rules, regulations, and time limits on them as if you can actually control others' lives. If Andries wants to take a break from the mediation of the SSB article, that's his right to decide, even if he decides he wants to edit other articles. And <b>you</b> have absolutely no right to smear him on his own talk page like this, making accusations. this is a website, after all. And someone ought to block <b>you</b> for the personal attacks against Andries, or hasn't any administrator noticed this yet??? It also wouldn't hurt the "mediation process" if you knocked off your snottiness, too, SSS108, because that isn't showing any real willingness to be rational and level headed, plus, it obviously rude and shows your distain for Andries. <b>A lot.</b> Sheesh, have a little patience, the SSB article has been there and will be there a long time. Apologies to Andries for my little rant here, but something needed to be said. &#160;:-) <a href="../../../s/y/l/User%7ESylviecyn_6451.html" title="User:Sylviecyn">Sylviecyn</a> 13:50, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is a dispute between these two people that obviously have been having a really hard time moving forward with this long dispute.

You have a habit of changing the Wiki policies to suit the goals of your subject's advertorials here on Wiki.

Again, please stop stalking me around this website, it's getting downright creepy. SSS108, you're still being quite rude, but your reaction to me is pretty funny, too. Do you actually think that by mentioning my real name here with a link to an off-Wiki forum, that your attempt at intimidation is actually scaring me?

<dd>Your response to me is inappropriate and mean-spirited, SSS108. Are you calling me an ex-premie, an ex-cult member? &#160;:-) I cannot believe you get away with this behavior here. Well, it's obvious now that Wikipedia has become a free-for-all for "NRM" leaders and their adherents on Wikipedia That's thanks in part the rewrite of the Living Bios article. Based on that, Wikipedia ought to now simply put up a welcome notice on the main page: "Calling all NRM Leaders! Free Advertorials for you here on Wikipedia now! Write whatever you want about yourselves, we'll allow it, publish and link to it! No critics need apply." But, SSS108 What you've really done is try to make me "guilty by association" and that's definitely not NPOV or civil or a decent thing to do to anyone. Btw, (lol!) I've never once sucked up to anyone in my life, except <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prem_Rawat_054e.html" title="Prem Rawat">Prem Rawat</a> -- definitely not Andries. (I've got a big smile on my face over that remark!) Actually, I'm one person who's been confrontational with Andries on the forum which <b>you linked here (not me, and I hope everyone reading notes that).</b> Talk about being polemic and extreme. But, Andries is <i>always</i> a very civil and fair-minded person, and that should be noted by any Wiki mediators, administrators, and other Wikipedia-big-wigs, because anyone writing those living bio articles, e.g. Prem Rawat or Sai Babba, etc., that are pro the subject, will talk till they're blue in the face trying to convince others that they have no POV. That's great laugh for the end of a wonderful week for me. Hey all, have a good weekend. I'll leave you all to this very serious business of yours. &#160;:-) <a href="../../../s/y/l/User%7ESylviecyn_6451.html" title="User:Sylviecyn">Sylviecyn</a> 13:11, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sylviecyn, I do not know whether your real name is <i>"cynthia"</i> or not. It happens to be the name you use on the Prem Rawat Forum, which is the reason I mentioned it (so others can see the type of posts you make there).

Since you have made that claim (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Sathya_Sai_Baba/Evidence&amp;diff=62688350&amp;oldid=62687785" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Sathya_Sai_Baba/Evidence&amp;diff=62688350&amp;oldid=62687785" rel="nofollow">Ref</a>) I ask that you provide the ArbCom with a <b>full</b> English translation to (only) your words on the <i>"Tabloid"</i> show. Since you did not speak for more than 2-3 minutes on that show, I don't think asking for a translation to your words is an inconvenience. Especially when you are trying to defend your position by referencing the Dutch TV show to support your <i>"Calumny Confirmed"</i> article. Thanks. <a href="../../../s/s/s/User%7ESSS108_4443.html" title="User:SSS108">SSS108</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/s/s/User_talk%7ESSS108_8de2.html" title="User talk:SSS108">talk</a>-<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_SSS108_26a1.html" title="Special:Emailuser/SSS108">email</a></sup> 21:40, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I stated in the TV show that SSB sexually abuses young men and that this in combination with psychogoligcal problems of these men may cause these men to commit suicidide or come close to committing suicides. I did not mention fake rings in the TV show, but this was already reported by Priddy on Norwegian TV. Nor did I mention the sex change but this was already reported among others by Nagel in her university article. In other words, my internet testimony <i>calumny confirmed</i> mentions little if any original research compared to what reputable sources had already written or shown. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 18:10, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Andries, then you should no problem providing the transcript to your appearance on the Dutch TV show.

<p>You said, out of your own mouth, that your appearance on the <i>Tabloid</i> show reflected the content in your article <i>Calumny Confirmed</i>. Therefore, the transcript to your words should be provided to support this claim. That you refuse to provide a transcript to support this claim leaves me with the distinct impression that you have something to hide. <a href="../../../s/s/s/User%7ESSS108_4443.html" title="User:SSS108">SSS108</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/s/s/User_talk%7ESSS108_8de2.html" title="User talk:SSS108">talk</a>-<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_SSS108_26a1.html" title="Special:Emailuser/SSS108">email</a></sup> 15:14, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Beste Andries,</p>
<p>Wikipedia is an encyclopedia. Trivia are not encyclopedic. If one ads references to trivia, they become overemphasized. The next step is giving references for the place and date of birth. It doesn't add anyting to the article, so therefore I oppose having this lengthy references. <a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElectionworld_75a7.html" title="User:Electionworld">Electionworld</a> <small>(<a href="../../../e/l/e/User_talk%7EElectionworld_b61d.html" title="User talk:Electionworld">talk</a></small> 07:41, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Trivia can always be deleted.</p>

Here's another quote from the same guideline: "Once a trivia section is empty, it should be removed". I emptied the trivia section (what was not too trivial was already included in the body of the article), and then deleted the "trivia" type section title, per the guideline. --<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> 13:47, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>What would you think about the potential notability of a Wikipedia Book Article on the book, <i>L. Ron Hubbard: Messiah or Madman</i>&#160;? It's gone through a few revisions and reprintings, and interestingly enough the entire text of the book is available online. The fact that the book survived numerous attempts by <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a> to block its publication should also seem to yield weight to its notability. Also, I added an infobox to the stub, on <i><a href="../../../b/a/r/Bare-faced_Messiah_c9ea.html" title="Bare-faced Messiah">Bare-faced Messiah</a></i>. Let me know what you think.

It's lazy, and it might well be a copyright violation. Besides, if you look at numerous other articles on books, you'll find that it's not done by other editors.

<p>Beland, I fing your comments on the book recovery from cults moving to a general discussion of the subject which I think is off-topic there. You can have a look at the article <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult.html" title="Cult">cult</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/c/Sect.html" title="Sect">sect</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-cult_trauma.html" title="Post-cult trauma">post-cult trauma</a>, <a href="../../../g/u/r/Guru.html" title="Guru">guru</a> <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_religious_movement.html" title="New religious movement">new religious movement</a> etc. You can also on-line read excerpts of the book by Dr. Len Oakes that I think is quite good though somewhat speculative, but his speculations are never implausible, I believe. <a href="http://www.sustainedaction.org/Explorations/prophetic_charisma_psychological_explanation%20part1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sustainedaction.org/Explorations/prophetic_charisma_psychological_explanation%20part1.htm" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 20:41, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I never saw a talk page so I didn't know a vote had been taken. However, I do not know of any other uses of the term Disengagement, save the situation with Israel. Has there ever been a case of a country willingly giving up their sovereign land in hopes for peace? When the Sudatenland, Rhineland, Austria, Chechoslovakia, etc were given to Hitler during appeasement, those were not necessarilly done with the consent of the countries. Only Israel gave land unilaterally to its enemies. I ask you to give me other examples of Disengagement and, if possible, please direct me to the talk page you are referring to.

Not likely, but thanks for the interest and support. It is disheartening to say the least the way that certain editors with an agenda can band together and push out a specific POV on their particular issue. A good example of this is the number of biography articles where there is virtually no positive information at all, and the article reads like an outright negative attack on this person. This is usually due to the fact that certain administrators and editors collaborate to maintain and control these articles. <a href="../../../s/m/e/User%7ESmeelgova_a687.html" title="User:Smeelgova">Smeelgova</a> 21:57, 26 October 2006 (UTC). <span id="63287410345"></span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm writing to you because I noticed that you contributed to the article and talk section of "Indian Buddhist Movement". I saw the article on the RFC page, then read the article and the talk page. I posted a lengthy analysis of the article on it's talk page and have watched it since.</p>
<p>I would like to invite you to read my analysis and post your opinion. This is a noteworthy topic, but it's currently incomplete and needs reorganization. The effort to improve this article has boiled down to two editors, dhammafriend and hkelkar, who are both engaging in edit wars and attacks on one another. There has been no substantial progress on this article since I first came upon it, so I'm hoping that you and other folks can come back an engage in a refocusing.</p>
<p>I greatly appreciate in advance anything you have to offer.</p>

<p>Hi, I wonder if you are concerned about this section because you suspect that the edits there are from cults such as Scientology? I am not a member of any cult group, but I am interested in cults like you. I do think the Hassan website is worth describing, as is his attitude to cults, which I think in academic terms is somewhat out-dated, since much recent academic analysis of NRMs suggests that in some cases they are less harmful than is sometimes claimed. Also Hassan does appear to label organisations "cults" and this labelling is then widely disseminated on the internet - yet Hassan is citing organisations as cults entirely on his own view. To be honest, your removal of cited and referenced material is easy to see as a bad edit, but I wanted to find out if we couldn't discuss this sensibly. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkThomas_730d.html" title="User:MarkThomas">MarkThomas</a> 18:31, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply. I have to say I find it very difficult indeed to see how a discussion of Steve Hassan's website and the criteria he uses to label a particular organisation a "cult" are not something to do with Steve Hassan. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkThomas_730d.html" title="User:MarkThomas">MarkThomas</a> 18:49, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>No problem. It equally gets me when (extremely) controversial pieces of information often go uncited. I happen to be from the former <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_SSR_cc70.html" title="Armenian SSR">Armenian SSR</a> and so have all volumes of the Soviet Encyclopedia which prove to be useful references when it comes to finding information about specific divisions (namely Armenians however).

<p>Andries, but do you know any more reliable sources about Shirdi Sai Baba? If so than use info from them for the article about Shirdi SB.

<p>Andries, I agree with Kkrystian that you may be off the mark here. Primary Sai Baba sources are limited in the west and in English. saibaba.org provides a resonable source for Sai Baba sayings. Anyone who has visited Shirdi has seen these sayings plastered over all sorts of souvenirs, banners, boodks, etc. They are very much attributed to Sai, and so far as I know, no one disputes that attribution. There is no particular controversy that Sai didn't say these things, at least none that I am aware of, and I think based on my 20+years interest I would have run across this sort of controversy if it existed.</p>
<p>I don't know that any source about Sai provides 'objective' or 'verifiable' information in the Wwstern academic sense. But it would be foolishness to begin to cherrypick from a book (like Hemadpant) as a 'good source', and to disallow cherrypicking from website (like saibaba.org). There is certainly no evidence to suggest that saibaba.org is any way a conterversial or deviant site run by some sort of wingnut fringe group. It seems to be very mainstream in its approach.</p>
<p>As the WP states: <i>Encyclopedic content must be verifiable.</i> This as opposed to straight-up opinion or original, nonpublished research. You can look these quotes up. You can find then decide whether or not to trust the reference source. So I think they pass this test.--<a href="../../../n/e/m/User%7ENemonoman_7359.html" title="User:Nemonoman">Nemonoman</a> 15:43, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Andries,</dd>
<dd>Yes, I do have Lawrence A. Babb's main work (awaiting some others to arrive) and Part Three does cover Sathya Sai Baba and THE LESSON OF TRUST in chapter 7 (Sathya Sai Babb's Miracles) &amp; 8 (Re Reenchantment of the World). Babb's seems to be a source that other academics rely on due to the thorough work, interview, collaboration with other academics, regional universities and sources work. It would appear that he traveled to India to do most of the research and reviewed vast amounts of documents.</dd>

<p>Andries, your presence here - the effort that you have applied over a period of more than 2 years, arguing with others and attempting to insert negative information into Wiki's PR articles - is your entrance fee to the ex-premie forum. You know as well as I do that they would quickly dump you if you ceased to represent their interests over here. I have seen Leason and Lyng's negative comments about you, and observed the way Heller pulls you into line whenever you ask questions that upset the prevailing group think. In other words, Momento, Jossi and others have spent probably hundreds of hours of valuable time responding to your banal and unhelpful offerings so that you can continue your forum participation. You claim to have an interest in cults. The group you are currently involved with was called the "Jim Heller Cult" by Jeff Leason<a href="http://www.one-reality.net/jeff_leason.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.one-reality.net/jeff_leason.htm" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> (A.K.A.

<p>Yes ,the Washington Post did reproduce Mishler's claim. But an exceptional, sensationalst claim that is negative and uncorrororated from a biased, ex-employer who died in the 70's is unacceptable in a biography of a living person. That a newspaper reproduced this claim doesn't excuse it from failing every other test for inclusion.<a href="../../../m/o/m/User%7EMomento_b078.html" title="User:Momento">Momento</a> 08:25, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you look at my previous paragraph you'll find me saying "You're right, it is Brown claiming Mishler claimed. But either way, Mishler's claims or Brown's claim that Mishler claimed, are both exceptional claims that should be supported by multiple credible and verifiable source. They are not". To which you sarcastically reply ....... "Yes, of course, if you really think that Prem Rawat is a Perfect Master bringing peace then this may sound as an exceptional claim"..... To which I reply that I don't consider that Mishler's claim is exceptional for that reason.<a href="../../../m/o/m/User%7EMomento_b078.html" title="User:Momento">Momento</a> 21:14, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For Wiki purposes exceptional claims are "surprising or apparently important claims that are not widely known".</dd>
</dl>
<p>Mishler's claim is suprising and not widely known. And Wiki policy is that "Exceptional claims should be supported by multiple credible and verifiable sources, especially with regard to historical events, politically-charged issues, and biographies of living people". And none of the scholars who have studied PR or the journalists who have written about PR corroborate Mishler's claim. Melton was well aware of Mishler's interview and chose to ignore most of it. Sophia Coller does not support Mishler's extreme view and Dettmer's has directly contradicted Mishler on many occasions.<a href="../../../m/o/m/User%7EMomento_b078.html" title="User:Momento">Momento</a> 20:54, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Andries, Just getting back like a turtle. I did read the book and will place the items in the talk page first before adding to the article. I found some other information regarding the sect which I will discuss once I have looked over it.

<p>The finding in the proposed decision doesn't say that you added unsourced criticism of SSB to the article; it says that you added a description of the contents of Priddy's site to the article, and that <i>those contents</i> contain unsourced criticism of SSB. Perhaps you're confusing it with some other proposal in the workshop? <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 20:00, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, I think you've misunderstood both my comment and the motion itself. The assertion is <i>not</i> that you added any unsourced criticism to the article; it is that (a) <i>Priddy's website</i> contains unsourced criticism and (b) you added a description of that website to the article. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 20:16, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, did you miss the first part of that finding ("Andries has editwarred extensively and repeatedly inserted links to an attack site maintained by Robert Priddy") and the next two ("Andries has sometimes used such material inappropriately..." and "Andries runs an attack web site")? The fact that many of your edits are acceptable is fine; but that doesn't really excuse the <i>un</i>acceptable ones thrown into the mix. It's my opinion that it would be best for everyone involved if you (as well as a number of other parties) were no longer editing this particular set of articles.</p>
<p>(Obviously, you might not agree with my assessment of the situation; but there's not much we can do about that, unfortunately.) <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 17:38, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Let's see:
<ul>
<li>Regarding Priddy: it's my opinion that the two cases cannot be adequately separated; the only reason Priddy's article was the locus of a dispute is because of his connections to SSB. Banning you only from Priddy's article would be pretty pointless; the same situation will occur again once we get an article on a different critic.</li>
<li>Regarding specific edits: I don't have time to go through a great many edits here, but just to give a few examples: there are problems both with edits using primary sources to give undue weight to the assertions of particular individuals (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sathya_Sai_Baba&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=99140373" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sathya_Sai_Baba&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=99140373" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>) and with edits that introduce allegations that are irrelevant to the topic being discussed (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sathya_Sai_Baba&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=100265897" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sathya_Sai_Baba&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=100265897" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>).</li>
<li>Regarding websites: it's my contention that your leading role in an anti-SSB site creates an unacceptable impression of a conflict of interest with you editing of articles in this area. (This is similarly true of the other involved editors who run anti- or pro-SSB sites, of course.)</li>
</ul>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>Regarding Rahm: "interviewed" is not really the same thing as "prominently featured"; an interview transcript is not really sufficien to give Rahm's particular allegation a sufficient level of notability that it should be presented as <i>his</i> particular allegation. (In other words: he's not <i>the</i> topic, but merely an example of the broader topic.)</li>
<li>Regarding the material: my concern is actually more about the "claims that Sathya Sai Baba can change into a woman instantaneously" part than the teachings part; they're largely irrelevant to the sexual abuse allegations, per se.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>(But, again, this is not meant to be a comprehensive combing through—and argument over—every edit you've made to the article. My point is that you <i>have</i> made problematic edits; this fact, combined with the Priddy issues, the website issues, and the fact that you were already warned as part of the previous arbitration case, justify, in my mind, not permitting you to edit the SSB article.) <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 19:11, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ol>
<li>But those allegations (credible or otherwise) have nothing to do with the allegations of sexual abuse. It's basically an unrelated topic that you've inserted into that section for no apparent reason.</li>
<li>You've violated the previous ArbCom ruling, for one; and, in any case, common practice is to avoid linking to attack sites unless they're themselves notable.</li>
<li>Obviously, we're not going to get anywhere on this point. I remain convinced that your highly prominent role in an anti-SSB group suggests a conflict of interest insofar as writing a neutral biography of him is concerned.</li>
<li>Perhaps I wasn't as clear as I should have been here. I didn't mean that you were issued a formal warning by the committee; rather, I meant to say that the case would have doubtless made you aware that your editing on the article was problematic. (After all, an amnesty wouldn't be meaningful if there wasn't anything to forgive.)</li>

<p>Well, the issue is not really a question of whether or not you have your own experiences here. The question is somewhat simpler:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is your objective here the creation of a <i>neutral</i> article on SSB, or an extension of your off-site <i>anti</i>-SSB activities?</li>
<li>If it's the former, how do we reconcile that with your prominent role in anti-SSB activism on other sites (and, in particular, the resultant entanglements when other people who are Wikipedia editors wind up being the targets of attacks by those sites)?</li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously, reducing or eliminating your external activism would be a factor in your favor, in terms of demonstrating that your purpose here wasn't essentially activist in character; otherwise, it is somewhat difficult to reconcile having you actively campaign against SSB off-Wikipedia and yet write a neutral biography of him on-Wikipedia. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 23:33, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>In a sense, about Rawat's claims to divinity. As I understand it, the basic gist of his proclaimations on the subject was that God was essentially abstract and unknowable, but can be understood through a medium. I've even seen interviews with Rawat to this effect, where he likens God to energy, which cannot by itself be observed, with the implication that we can observe its effects, such as light and heat radiated by a light bulb. In this context, Rawat placed himself as <i>more</i> relevant than God, because his teachings were knowable, where as God is hopelessly beyond comprehesion. Is my understanding in this respect accurate? <a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMael-Num_eb75.html" title="User:Mael-Num">Mael-Num</a> 00:43, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Not sure that it is accurated regarding Rawat, but the reasoning sounds very familar, because it used be my own for <a href="../../../s/a/t/Sathya_Sai_Baba_611f.html" title="Sathya Sai Baba">Sathya Sai Baba</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 00:54, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Fair enough, I'll continue to look for the interview with the quote from him, but in any case let's look at the problem as it relates to the article. As I see it, because his basic message is "God is all-powerful and unknowable, except to me so I can tell you what God wants" there is a vague distinction there. That is: God's one thing, and Rawat is another, but Rawat is in perfect sync with God, so you may as well revere the god you <i>can</i> relate to because the actual God is inaccessible to everyone else but Rawat. To me, this is semantics. All the same, it leaves enough wiggle room for those who would prefer to downplay this element of old-style Rawat's message in favor of the more recent "button-down" version of Rawat's message that he is, essentially, a lifestyle coach. That is, people who want Rawat to be acceptable by appearing to be a Dr. Phil sort of new millenium lifestyle coach don't want anyone to be aware of the fact that he used to be a 70's guru, which may seem outdated, alientating to the religious, kooky, or all of the above. Am I on the right track still? <a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMael-Num_eb75.html" title="User:Mael-Num">Mael-Num</a> 02:30, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm almost positive I saw a video clip of Rawat saying this quote, but if you look <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Prem_Rawat#1970s" class="external text" title="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Prem_Rawat#1970s" rel="nofollow">here</a>, about halfway down the section, there is a Q &amp; A where Rawat's response is the God = energy, Guru = lightbulb analogy (which I thought was a very clever way of expressing an abstract idea). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMael-Num_eb75.html" title="User:Mael-Num">Mael-Num</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/e/User_talk%7EMael-Num_9baf.html" title="User talk:Mael-Num">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mael-Num_d733.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mael-Num">contribs</a>) 00:03, 30 January 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p><i>I would like to know the following. Is it okay to ban a person</i> [from a set of articles] <i>indefinetely for?</i></p>
<dl>
<dd><i>1. Off Wikipedia affilations, such as my self-addmitted affiliation to exbaba.com? If so, then would you advise new editor not to edit under real names and not to reveal affilations?</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, I certainly think so; but the rest of your question seems somewhat slanted. I would rather advise not editing those articles where one's off-Wikipedia affiliations could be an issue; the question of revealing them thus becomes quite moot. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 03:53, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>2. Repeatedly linking to one of the homepages of the subject in question in complete accordance with <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> and generally accepted Wikipedia practices, such as I did on <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Priddy_8f20.html" title="Robert Priddy">Robert Priddy</a>?</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Not in of itself, no. Doing so when (a) the page in question is an attack site <i>and</i> (b) the issue has already been the subject of an arbitration case, on the other hand, is pretty much pushing your luck. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 03:53, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Kirill, thanks for your answers, though I think you are making some mistakes
<dl>
<dd>ad 1. I do not have a conflict of interest due to my affiliation with exbaba.com on the article <a href="../../../s/a/t/Sathya_Sai_Baba_611f.html" title="Sathya Sai Baba">Sathya Sai Baba</a>; I will not edit any differently when I disaffiliate. Following your way of reasoning I should not edit the article <a href="../../../h/o/u/House.html" title="House">house</a>, because I may not be able to edit there NPOV due to my off-Wikipedia affilations. (I live in a house.)</dd>
<dd>ad 2. The article <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Priddy_8f20.html" title="Robert Priddy">Robert Priddy</a> was never treated in the previous arbcom case. I had requested a clarification from the arbcom but that was ignored. I could not reasonably have done more.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Let's be realistic here: living in a house isn't a meaningful conflict of interest. If, however, you were to be running a site for concerned former residents of houses with the purpose of documenting how houses abuse people, then, yes, I would say you shouldn't be editing the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House.html" title="House">house</a> article. (It is difficult, admittedly, to neatly answer the obvious philosophical question: is the issue here <i>caused</i> by running the site, or is running the site merely the most obvious <i>symptom</i> of the issue? Frankly speaking, I think either option leads us to the same practical result—that one oughtn't edit articles on topics that one runs such sites about—making the debate interesting but moot.)</dd>
<dd>It's regrettable that we obviously don't see eye-to-eye on this point; but I really don't know how else to explain it to you. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 05:48, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Kirill, I want to thank you for your time to reply to me, though it will be clear that I think that you are wrong on all points. I intend to list other people who are in a similar situation as I (e.g. who maintain websites critical of Scientology) on the Wikipedia COI noticeboard to enable the Wikipedia community to make a fair, and consistent ruling about such cases. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 22:56, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem is that the dispute resolution process for the article is broken. The article has been listed dozens of times on RFC and hardly anybody responded. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 21:26, 23 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That is not an excuse, Andries. If you believe <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a> is broken, you should abandon WP now, or work to make it work. Lack of belief on NPOV or any other policy are no grounds for dismissing them. Note that <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a> is official policy, not just a nice to have thing, and you need to abide by these like it or not. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 21:33, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>yes, and the official policy is unrealistic and does not work in the case of <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prem_Rawat_054e.html" title="Prem Rawat">Prem Rawat</a>. I do not understand how you can deny this. Many RFC are not responded to, not just in the case of Rawat.

<dd>Yes, some RfCs are not responded to (that is not unusual) but others are. We can always ask for third opinions from editors we trust, for example.

<dd>How about maintaining a list of unresponded versus responded RFCs? At least we will make the problem, if there is any, visible to the community. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 21:47, 23 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That would be not helpful, Andries. If RfCs are not responded to, we need to find other ways to deal with disputes. The first one is to ask for third opinions, and if that does not work request informal mediation, and so on. You know the drill, don't you? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 21:53, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Mediation is a step that should be approached if previous steps have been exhausted. We have used RfCs extensively with little success, and at times we have asked for third opinions, with some success. IMO, the article is well sourced and we have made some progress with a merge (that we did not know it was possible), and recently adding new scholarly sources. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 22:19, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>What should I have done on <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Priddy_8f20.html" title="Robert Priddy">Robert Priddy</a> when all dispute resolution was not responded to?</i> Simple answer...walk away for as long as needed. Maybe forever. There is not a topic that any one of us needs to edit. The earlier that an editor in the course of editing at Wikipedia understands this concept the better it is for them, the community, and the encyclopedia. (This is also a response to the above situation about 3RR issues related to <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prem_Rawat_054e.html" title="Prem Rawat">Prem Rawat</a> as noted in the above topic on this talk page). When ArbCom looks for solutions to disputes, in the final analysis we are not going after fair to the editor. We are going after what is best for accomplishing our goal of writing the encyclopedia.

<p>Your recent edits to WP:BAN and WP:COI may reflect a misunderstanding on your part. First, you have not been banned as yet, as the case has not closed and there is no majority vote for the ban.

<dd>Sure. That <i>and all the rest</i>: The previous ArbCom case in which you were graciously extended amnesty and quickly got dragged back to another case; the editwarring pattern; the violation of a previous arbCom case remedy; two botched mediation attempts, etc. You keep insisting that the proposed remedy is because of your COI, but that is certainly not the case, and in doing that you are digging your own grave, so to speak. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 22:44, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Please let me know exactly what you find objectionable about the compromise version I crafted and proposed. If you think it is unacceptable, please let me know why. Only if you express what you find lacking in it can I rewrite the draft to accomodate any concerns. I am trying to make a version acceptable to all parties, including you.

<p>I will ask a third and final time that you explicitly state what is unacceptable about the compromise version to you. If you fail to do so, I cannot take your concerns into account and they will not be reflected in the final version. <a href="../../../v/a/s/User%7EVassyana_7573.html" title="User:Vassyana">Vassyana</a> 15:04, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>There's a guy out there re-writing this category definition because he says it was written by a noob or non-expert, and he knows better, so he'll just fix it. I don't think he's even heard of Weber. --<a href="../../../o/r/a/User%7EOrangemike_a411.html" title="User:Orangemike"><font color="darkorange">Orange Mike</font></a> 20:21, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My friend, the entire theory/idea of charisma is not based <i>entirely</i> on Weber as it pre-dates his life by many-many centuries (please see the etymology of charisma on its page; it's a word with ancient Greek roots). Also, please see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charisma#References_and_further_reading" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charisma#References_and_further_reading" rel="nofollow">reference/further reading</a> list that I've been compiling at the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charisma.html" title="Charisma">charisma</a> article and then get back to me. --<a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWassermannNYC_d58e.html" title="User:WassermannNYC">WassermannNYC</a> 20:30, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
