<p>To be honest I'm sick of waiting for the GA people to get around to reviewing it, and wish to plump for FAC if it meets FA criteria. I have't read anything which says you can't nominate for GAC and FAC, so let's go for it.</p>
<p>The only part I'm worried about is 1. a. which asks for compelling prose, something which one or two editors may seize upon if it isn't met. Also, a lot of work is required during FAC - editors make demands etc. Check <a href="../../../w/i/a/WP%7EWIAFA_0ac3.html" title="WP:WIAFA">WP:WIAFA</a>, and if you feel it meets all of the criteria and are willing to face the wrath of FAC reviewers who'll make petty criticisms and expect you to rectify them feel free to nominate.</p>
<p>(PS - During FAC some editors may make edits you disagree with)</p>

<dd>I'm not worried about what other editors think - maybe they can improve it. Wiki is as it is.... I'm not sure about going for an FA at the same time, because it will confuse some reviewers. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasegde_c4ec.html" title="User:Andreasegde">andreasegde</a> 22:11, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>FAC is next but I'd like to be sure the prose is brilliant and we've ticked everything off the todo list first.

<dd>Yes the prose is something I mentioned above - as you know Kingboyk, there's a few editors at FAC who check the prose like hawks. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuciferMorgan_f0d2.html" title="User:LuciferMorgan">LuciferMorgan</a> 21:37, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>(2nd attempt at replying, as my computer keeps freezing up necessitating a reboot... sigh&#160;:( ) I can't say for certain because I haven't read the article in it's entirety for a while due to being busy. What I can say with certainty though is that any article, especially a long one like this, will need a copyedit regardless of who wrote it. I'm not a particularly brilliant copyeditor but as the material is so good to start with I'm sure I can help, and then the real high quality folks (like Tony) will no doubt chip in with complaints and suggestions when it's at FAC. An important ingredient in the success of the KLF articles has been <a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVinoir_4d5a.html" title="User:Vinoir">User:Vinoir</a> and myself having each other to copyedit the other's contributions so, yes, it will certainly benefit from that.</dd>
<dd>I'm also keen to ensure we don't give undue prominence to trivial matters and give due prominence to important details (such as conveying just how important and influential The Beatles were and McCartney's role in that). I also want to check that everything is adequately referenced, that we aren't just retelling Barry Miles' account of Macca, and that the todo list is complete.</dd>
<dd>I'm starting work on Monday (on nights) but I'll try to do my bit during this week as it seems we're at the cleaning and checking stage now. Perhaps we can have an FA star as a Christmas present if we get it onto FAC by next week?&#160;:) --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 14:38, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Andrew, Reverting to an old revision is really easy. Click History and you'll see all the old revisions. Find the revision you want to revert to and click on the date/time of that revision. That will load the old page. Then click "edit this page". You'll see the following warning:</p>
<dl>
<dd>You are editing a prior version of this page. If you save it, any changes made since this version will be removed.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Just type "rv" (meaning "revert") into the edit summary and hit "save page".</p>
<p>In the history list you can also compare versions to see what has changed. Just click the circular checkboxes next to the two revisions you want to compare and and press "compare selected versions". For example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paul_McCartney&amp;diff=91592232&amp;oldid=91575009" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paul_McCartney&amp;diff=91592232&amp;oldid=91575009" rel="nofollow">this is the edits you've made today since my revert</a>.</p>
<p>I also recommend you install <a href="../../../p/o/p/WP%7EPOPUPS_4a3b.html" title="WP:POPUPS">popups</a>. In addition to aiding reversion they give you features like hover the mouse over a wikilink and see a preview of the article which is linked to. They are really <i>great</i> and I thoroughly recommend installing them.</p>
<p>Hope that helps! --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 14:43, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Re FA - I don't know, to be honest. It isn't a part of Wiki that interests me, (the need for references and citations, standards of language, etc.) - I just edit for spelling and grammar generally, and try to limit vandalism. I do appreciate the work required to take an article to FA, and think it a worthy task; I just don't care for the process. I suggest you take a look at the reasons why it failed last time, and see if the criteria has been satisfied. If the view is that it has, then it should be re-submitted.<a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 21:18, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If we're talking Macca, I don't think it's ever been submitted before. It'll pass when it's ready. It isn't ready yet - needs a final polish by somebody who isn't the final author, a check that everything is referenced etc., basically what I've written elsewhere here or on the article talk page - but it <i>will</i> pass I'm pretty sure. I can't see why it wouldn't... although I suppose we'll have to take another look at article size... 140kb. OK, that could be an issue, but hopefully we'll chop 10k or so off when copyediting... --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 02:51, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My mistake, it was a GA it previously failed on. I would suggest that whoever gives it a final polish should already have taken an article to FA, so they know what is required, and not have been a major contributor previously - so to see it with fresh eyes. We will have to enquire of colleagues from other articles. I will gladly give the article a quick SPAG (spelling and grammar) check, if wanted. <a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 13:55, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>At least yours works! Ours broke down recently&#160;:( Totally agree about a fresh set of eyes. I can spare 45 mins or so tonight and will have a look at it, but if a good editor who knows FA and hasn't touched the article could be recruited it would be great.

<p>I dunno if I'm the one to pick a section - maybe look at how sections could be moved into their own article? If you just need to loose 1,000 words, however, what I do with coursework is to read through and see which little words could be lost - for example (and this is just something I've made up off of the top of my head), <i>Paul McCartney was forced to pay $X to his one-legged ex-wife Heather Mills-MCartney</i> could be cut down to <i>MCartney paid $X to Mills-MCartney</i>. In an article as long as this, it shouldn't be hard to loose 1,000 words by getting rid of exesses like <i>and then</i> instead of just <i>then</i> and <i>because of</i> instead of just <i>because</i>. Hope that helps. As a side note, I think he was lucky. In the olden days if you were robbed by someone with one leg, it would probably have been a pirate and you would be lucky to escape with your life.

<p>hi - I'm not trying to step on your edits on Lennon page - I think most are excellent - I just disagree with one, removing the description of Lennon/McC writing team. I added a ref and am looking for more and better ones, but would like to keep the text. Maybe you can help out with refs or rewrite on this that keeps the ideas intact? I don't think it's enough to say their writing styles complement one another without explaining what that means. And surely "massively successful" can be backed up with citations or perhaps modified a bit to say the same thing with a citation. I posted a note on <a href="../../../j/o/h/Talk%7EJohn_Lennon_9d69.html" title="Talk:John Lennon">Talk:John Lennon</a> about why I reverted - again, I don't want to edit war on this, just don't want it to be denuded of anything descriptive - can be descriptive and encyclopedic at the same time. <a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a> 21:08, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>SOunds good to me - I haven't looked in on McCartney for a while and will do so - have been busy chasing away the vandals from Lennon. Finally got the page semi-protected which has made an enormous difference. Unbelievable idiots out there. So - if you do find some nice refs for how Lennon was hard-edged, McC optimistic, and that their songs were successful... duh ... I'd appreciate it.

<p>Something doesn't make sense in the early years section - you say that Freddie was off in the army or whatever, supported Julia &amp; John financially, but then went AWOL and the checks stopped. So Julia starts going out and gets knocked up by Taffy Williams <s>(was it he? if not, why are we using his name?</s>) - Then you say Freddie offers to support Julia John and the baby but Julia refuses and has the baby, gives her up for adoption. But to follow that with saying Freddie walked out on them when John was 5 (which is when Julia had the baby), sounds kind of skewed - he "walked out on" a woman who just had a baby by another man? Maybe Spitz speaks to this - it's disjointed the way it now reads, and makes Freddie look worse than maybe he was. Or something. COuld you check how Spitz deals with Freddie's "walking out"? thanks <a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a> 06:37, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I didn't write that bit, but it is true. (But by my reckoning John was 'almost' 5...) I only put the first paragraph in, and I didn't have time to do more. Re: The links - Spitz is a respected author, and there is also a web link there to the 'Liverpool Lennons'. Other sources are also available on the Web, and I have Cynthia Lennon's book as well. Wait until the bit where Freddie takes John to Blackpool, because he wanted to take John to New Zealand, and John had to choose between Freddie and Julia... heavy stuff for a young child. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasegde_c4ec.html" title="User:Andreasegde">andreasegde</a> 12:14, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I didn't put this in because I thought it was too detailed, but Taffy Williams wasn't interested in Julia because she wouldn't give up John. Freddie and his brother cornered Taffy in a bar around Xmas 1944 (to find out if the rape story was true or not) and Taffy admitted he had been having an affair with Julia for the last six months, so the kid was his. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasegde_c4ec.html" title="User:Andreasegde">andreasegde</a> 12:19, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Yeah, with the Blackpool stuff it makes much more sense. Wow, a lot to lay on a little kid. You're doing great work - very much appreciated. Btw, I think you could include something of the above Freddie-Taffy story, since the reason Taffy-Julia didn't work out was that she wouldn't give up John - that kind of tells us something more about Julia in a positive light - otherwise one might look at this woman and see that she was whoring around, gave away both of her kids in one way or another, etc, and I gather that may not be a fair assessment. Anyway - I'll leave that to you. ABout the musical talent of both parent - I have no idea where that came from - it was in before I started editing the page - so it may not be correct. I guess we'll see if anyone comes up with a citation, but if your extensive collection isn't yielding anything, it may actually be wrong. <a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a> 18:32, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What I meant was; for example, the bit with Lennon's mother. If you wanted to go into more detail about her death, you would do that in her article, which would be where to fork that specific content. To be honest, I think people should worry about the article's quality and stop worrying about its size. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuciferMorgan_f0d2.html" title="User:LuciferMorgan">LuciferMorgan</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with Lucifer's last sentence completely -in general I think there's an over-concern among some wikipedia editors about length, and what it leaves are incomplete, unsatisfying, sketchy pieces or on the other hand they remove short pieces altogether when there may not be more needed than a short piece, but it needs to stand alone. I'll comment on talk lennon shortly on this. <a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a> 18:46, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>Thanks - yes fresh eyes often see things more clearly. I tweaked Linda's graf a little more and think it reads well, but I'm bothered by the tapes graf in there - I suppose it needs to be included somewhere but is kind of unexplained where it is.

<p>Well, I hope what I posted there will give them something to think about - I really meant what I said. The article when I started working on it, not all that long ago, was really just a shell in a lot of places. I've added actual information, references (as have a number of others) and mostly I've done editing and organizing work, but it clearly needed a lot of help, and still does. So your energy, and that of the other newer editors, is a real shot in the arm. If I can provide a touch of that freshness to Macca (love that - we never hear that in the US but I am now officially adopting it) I'll feel as if I'm repaying your Lennon work, at least a little. I enjoy working with you - this is supposed to be fun. If only more people on wikipedia had senses of humor. Now, as for that barnstar, I'd be honored. The one I have was generously bestowed on me by a fellow in Australia after I more or less successfully, it seems, came up with wording on <a href="../../../b/e/e/Bee_Gees_290f.html" title="Bee Gees">Bee Gees</a> that would describe their origins in a way that satisfied the Manx, English, <i>and</i> Australian factions. Didn't know there was a war among them, eh? You have no idea. I had to look up "Manx-born" - totally never heard of that word before.(By the way, some time explain to me why people are so incensed about Macca (!!) being called "English" not "British" and vice versa? To my New York ears, there's pretty much no difference, although obviously I know that England is Merry Old and Britain includes those other bits. You can't imagine how funny these wars over such tiny differences sound to a furriner.

<p>Typed live, as you see it. Some things I can write about in my sleep - why Vietnam was wrong, why Kent State was one of the worst days in American history, why it is tragic that Phil Ochs is dead, the utter senselessness of Lennon's murder (and yes, goddamnit, he is still MOURNED throughout the world - glad whoever objected to that one stopped)...etc. Thanks for your nice words. The other guy is from <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kent_State_Shootings_4205.html" title="Kent State Shootings">Kent State Shootings</a> - a military guy - and we've gone head-to-head a bit about Kent State, but I must say he is reasonable and actually takes points. Although we very much disagree, it's respectful. Which is more than I can say about other people who've been in and out of these arguments (see <a href="../../../k/e/n/Image_talk%7EKent_State_massacre.jpg_753f.html" title="Image talk:Kent State massacre.jpg">Image talk: Kent State massacre.jpg</a> - yeah, an image page). So...... Macca's almost there and I see you're getting your hands into Lennon again - I haven't looked at it yet, but I will!

<dd>I'm really sorry, but it's because I work on articles in depth, and I make changes that would take longer to explain than the time it takes to do it.

<dd>No, I understand, I work in that mode myself. You always have the option of forcing it. In the "my preferences" panel in the "Editing" tab there's a checkbox to "Prompt me when entering a blank edit summary". If you check this option, you can't save an edit without exntering an edit summary. I have this turned on and find it really useful. After a short while adding edit summaries becomes second nature. I don't find it a problem now at all even when doing a large sequence of them. Up to you of course, but its worth knowing about.

<p>The quote about thanking Jesus for the end of touring doesn't make sense where it is now if we have the jesus controversy down below - we used to have Jesus as a sub section of the 60s part, followed by 'no more touring'. I'm having some trouble with the way things are laid out now (although I had other problems with the way it used to be) - maybe the controversies should be broken up and put back in chronological order since you've changed the whole page to be more chronological?

I get why it can't be in there, although if I should find any good refs I might try to find a place for it because - seriously - it's not a question of being a Lennon fan as much as it does reflect the reality that he is indeed still mourned around the world. Lots of other dead rockers are not, but Lennon's death did transcend the norm. Even Harrison - people are sad of course that he died too young, but it's not in the way that Lennon is mourned. But anyway, I get it and am not putting it back in. That is eerie about your birthday - and sad.</dd>
<dd>Won't have a chance to look at the latest changes until later on- it is a tough rearrangement because the page was kind of quirky (I know how much some admins <i>love</i> quirky...) and really way out of chronological order which kind of makes it diffifult to have it flow properly. But we'll keep trying - you're doing a great job, as always. <strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> 20:21, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Look at the Macca history talk pages, and you will see that me and my pal Vera, Chuck and Dave seriously fell out with Kingboyk about how the Macca page is now, with us both wanting it to be chronological. We finally came around to realise that subjects are dealt with in sections (Kingboyk is an admin, after all, and has worked on a lot of FA articles). Anyway, we got up, dusted ourselves off and shook hands like the gentlemen we are. I now doff my cap to the bosses upstairs, and work on the articles as requested, which shows my working class roots, and my previous job as a percussionist...&#160;:) <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasegde_c4ec.html" title="User:Andreasegde">andreasegde</a> 20:34, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Did I? Blow me down, I didn't want to do that. Maybe it was when I copied it and looked for a place to put it/move it.
