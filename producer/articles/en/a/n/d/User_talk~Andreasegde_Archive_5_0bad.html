<p>Hello. I've been following the discussions on the talk page there. I have a proposal for you that will both help clear the backlog and get our articles reviewed. I don't know if this is acceptable practice, but I personally don't see any reason why it wouldn't be OK. I will review one of the articles you nominated if you will review one of mine. I nominated <a href="../../../k/h/m/Khmer_language.html" title="Khmer language">Khmer language</a> on Feb 4th. If you can review that one, I will review your nomination of <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freddie_Lennon_31f8.html" title="Freddie Lennon">Freddie Lennon</a>. I have not contributed to that article (or any Beatles-related article for that matter) although I am a big Beatles afficionado and trivia buff. For the sake of transparancy, we have to be clear that this is not at all an agreement to <i>pass</i> each other's articles, simply to review them in order to process them and help clear them from the backlog. In fact, I would appreciate full candor as I would eventually really like to expand this article more and take it through Peer Review and FAC one day.--<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamThweatt_f58c.html" title="User:WilliamThweatt">William Thweatt</a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWilliamThweatt_8c60.html" title="User talk:WilliamThweatt">Talk</a></sup> | <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WilliamThweatt_f34f.html" title="Special:Contributions/WilliamThweatt">Contribs</a></sup> 03:50, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I advise against this procedure. I have faith both of you are good, honest editors, but more cynical Wikipedians may see this as "If you pass my article for GA, I'll pass yours for GA".

<dd>Nah, we wern't even thinking of that, as WilliamThweatt said. Have a look at WilliamThweatt's page and you will see that I told him I would definitely fail his article, so I wouldn't review it.

<dd>Thanks for the input. I neither started nor wrote the article, I've just expanded it, cleaned up the English and added some refs and sources. I knew it still needed a lot of work, but nobody else was seriously working on it (except vandals). The GA nom seemed to be the only way to get some feedback. I will try to implement your suggestions before somebody actually gets to reviewing the article (at the current rate, I ought to have a few months to do this&#160;:-)).

<p>So, it's now the Beatles, is it? Every mention of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Band_86d7.html" title="The Band">The Band</a> should be changed (in the middle of a sentence) to the Band.

<dd>So find an authority! Some style reference that tops Chicago, The Times and The Gruniard! I also ingested the truth that proper nouns are capitalised (and that band names are proper nouns) along with my (big) Mams milk, and I went out and looked for hard facts to back my stance... I didn't find them! I also signposted the debate in the Newsletters (yes, it is <i><b>I</b></i> that cobbles together that tome for the most part) and when there was <u>no evidence</u> presented at the appropriate place I said, "Fair do's. You lot have put together a better argument!" and signed away my soul.</dd>
<dd>I also imbibed with my mothers milk that Pluto is a planet. It seems I was wrong there, too. <a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 21:32, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Have no fear, Dear LessHeard... I have read that a lot of editors concerned with 'The/the Beatles' problem have cited English/American Newspapers. "Man Bites Dog", for example (which implies that the man bites the dog every day = wrong). They do that to save ink, and to make the headlines fit the page. "A man bit a dog yesterday" doesn't look so good...</dd>

<dd>Anyway; We all learned how to speak before we learned how to write. (Ugg, uggg...) We (Brits—as you know) make a verbal definition between when we say "the", and when we say "the"—pronounced <i>Thee</i> Beatles, and not insects (a lot of people forget that use of the definite article)—which means there are no others like them. It gives a <i>special emphasis</i> on the use of a title.</dd>

<dd>I thought I would have to do this, and I will: If you write "the Beatles", it must mean that there were other "Beatles" bands in other cities. If you write "The Beatles", then it must be "The Beatles" from Liverpool. "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Band_86d7.html" title="The Band">The Band</a>" from America/Canada is also the same. It is called "The definite article", which means it is definite. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasegde_c4ec.html" title="User:Andreasegde">andreasegde</a> 22:23, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I believe you. So find the fucking reference book that trounces the style books. It is the same as citations, we may <b>know</b> that the Lennon first learned banjo chords but you still have to find the book that says it to use it as a reference. We may know that definitive articles and or proper nouns should be capitalised, but you have to find the tome which says it. Simple. <a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 23:26, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>There is no such tome. It is called English. We learned it when we were babes, and it is still changing... The <i>style</i> books are all written by Americans (sorry, Americans) because they desire style. Check the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">Wikipedia:Manual of Style</a> page - it has NO references from a book. Why should we "give up the ghost" under pressure from our American friends?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I am not being aggressive here - I am only reacting against the idea that "Heavy industry" should not be written as "heavy industry", and that the Beatles should be "The Beatles". The <i>emphasis</i> is paramount. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasegde_c4ec.html" title="User:Andreasegde">andreasegde</a> 00:30, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
So, you would capitalize the "b" in "band" (or the "t" in "the") for emphasis? I guess I would have used italics or underscoring instead (in much the same way that you did above). I agree that it would be quite natural (even for us heathen Americans) to pronounce "the" as "thee" when there's a point to be made such as the one you make above ("No, Fred, <i>the</i> Band, not the band"). But in writing I believe the usual way of marking the emphasis is with italics or underscoring. Besides, do you always say <i>thee</i> with "Beatles" or only when it's for emphasis? It would seem that if it's the latter, then you would be suggesting a sometimes-lowercase/sometimes-uppercase "t" rule, depending on whether you're in a mood to emphasize that it's the one and only Beatles, you know, the ones from Liverpool, that is. Seems like that's not going to come up very often on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Incidentally, we Americans don't actually have a monopoly on style manuals -- see, e.g., <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Watson_Fowler_190e.html" title="Henry Watson Fowler">Henry Watson Fowler</a>, <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lynne_Truss_48c2.html" title="Lynne Truss">Lynne Truss</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hart%27s_Rules_8aa4.html" title="Hart's Rules">Hart's Rules</a> (see generally <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linguistic_prescription.html" title="Linguistic prescription">Linguistic prescription</a>) or the various in-house style manuals I cited (Guardian and Times) -- though it may be true that we're style seekers, I don't know, I'll leave that judgment to you. Moreover, I thought that the citations I gave to British authority supported the notion that it was actually British usage -- not your American friends -- that supplied the "pressure."McTavidge 05:07, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>At present, I'm reading <i>Paul McCartney</i> by Alan Clayson, and The Beatles is capitalised throughout, including the index - what style is that? <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVera%2C_Chuck_%26_Dave_abb3.html" title="User:Vera, Chuck &amp; Dave">Vera, Chuck &amp; Dave</a> 13:13, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I concluded that the proponents had established their case. Since I was the only non-proponent involved in the debate, and a regular contributor to the Beatles Project, and had previously argued vigorously for retaining the capitalisation, I am a little peeved that after all the effort I went to and the degree of proof I required before making the decision it is being challenged. <a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 15:35, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The use of the TM marker (or (R) symbol) is most appropriate when the owner of the trademark is doing the writing and wants to remind the world not to infringe on the trademark, but it is generally not required for other people to use the marker.McTavidge 17:33, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks McTavidge (accepted) but they did not trademark the Beatles. It was The Beatles.

<dd>I've seen their US trademark registration as well and grant that they filed "The" along with "Beatles". But there's a difference between what trademark lawyers and regular writers will do and need to do. As I noted in the discussion previously, from their standpoint this is all about marketing and brand management, and that's fine for them, but we're not them and we're not in charge of burnishing their image. Their decision to file a trademark registration using a nonstandard capitalization convention doesn't necessarily compel anyone else to follow suit.McTavidge 21:36, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So you know what "sod off", and "dickhead" mean. Not many people do. They are not swear words. If you are admonishing me for replying to a vandal that left a snide link for the "reproductive system" on my talk page (calling me a cunt and a prick, if you can read between the user's lines) then you are defending a vandal. The user has no name, did not sign in, and attacked me personally. Do you really want to defend that?

<p>I was going to step away from this, since I was only going by the rules and I didn't want to get into a big dispute (especially with editors who I respect and have enjoyed working with), but recent events have brought me back.</p>
<p>The debate about naming the convention regarding the capitalisation or not of the letter "t" of <i>the</i> in <i>t/The Beatles</i> has been going on for a while. I have endured the snide remarks of a <b>T</b>wit, and have engaged in civil debate with some others who continued to question Project policy regarding the issue. I pointed out the need to establish a reasonable argument for their viewpoint over and above that of some <i>professional knowledge</i> so there could be a debate. When they did provide reasonable grounds for reopening the debate I used the offices of the Beatles Newsletter <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_The_Beatles_Outreach_Newsletter_Issue_009_c484.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject The Beatles/Outreach/Newsletter/Issue 009">Issue 9:<i>Issue of the Month</i></a> to request comment, debate on the matter. <b>There was no response.</b> In the next Newsletter <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_The_Beatles_Outreach_Newsletter_Issue_010_bcb0.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject The Beatles/Outreach/Newsletter/Issue 010">Issue 10:<i>Issue of last Month</i></a> I commented that there had been no response, and that the Project policy would be altered to use of the lowercase. Again, nobody other than the proponents responded. After a brief while I did as I said I would, and amended the Policy.</p>

<p>The new Policy is not to the liking of some of the editors involved the the Beatles Project (as the previous one was not to others.) <i><b>After</b></i> the policy was implemented reasons and arguments for retaining the previous convention were given. Authorities were cited and some discussion was created. Very recently more than one editor has edited Beatles related articles specifically to reflect the previous policy.</p>

<p>My preference is to capitalise the letter <i>t</i> of <i>the</i> in <i>the Beatles</i>.</p>
<p>Wikipedia has very few rules; two of the most important relate to consensus <u>and</u> verifiability.</p>

<p>No recent discussion occurred when the matter of the use of lowercase or uppercase was notified in two Newsletters, other than between myself and the proponents of lowercase at the Policy talkpage. Since Policy implementation discussion has only occurred on the talkpages of concerned editors, or on the talkpages of some of the articles, and <i>not at the Policy talkpage</i>.</p>
<p>More than one editor has unilaterally decided to ignore the new Policy, going so far as to amend articles to reflect the previous convention.</p>

<p>The Beatles Project is being disrupted by editors who I personally know to be conscientious and dedicated contributors of long and good standing. In that there is now occurring what might be considered vandalism (the knowing altering of articles in a manner that is against Wikipedian and Project rules and policy), likely as a result of their strongly held views, I believe that this matter needs urgent addressing. I am copying this to the Policy talkpage, and to all the editors involved in formulating the new policy and the recent opponents. I suggest that this debate is taken there, and that this matter is decided in a civil manner <b>in accordance with the principles of Wikipedia</b>.</p>
<p><br />
I am deeply saddened that it has come to this. I am depressed that editors (people) whose integrity and civility (not to say sheer fun) I had been proud to be associated with have acted in (what I see as) <a href="../../../g/o/o/WP%7EGood_faith_ea7b.html" title="WP:Good faith">bad faith</a> and flagrant disregard for the rules and guidelines of both Wikipedia and The Beatles Project. <a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 23:55, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't know about you kidda, but there's no way I'm staying here after being called a feckin vandal, and have one of your own turn on you in favour of a bunch of yanks whose only contributions have been to insult us, and cause trouble, and your man up there feels deeply saddened!

<p>How come I never saw this 'The/the talk' page, until I stumbled on it by accident? Are you telling me that I am either too stupid or too blind? These conversations are NEVER finished, as you well know, because they pop up again and again. A bunch of lay editors laying down their stylistic rules over the law is not my idea of being sensible. I will come back to this, but one has to work. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasegde_c4ec.html" title="User:Andreasegde">andreasegde</a> 06:34, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What law--and does it matter that, as I said in the earlier policy discussion, I'm not a "lay editor" but a professional one? --<a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukobe_9277.html" title="User:Lukobe">Lukobe</a> 21:56, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I really would prefer to be doing this over a few pints in a dingy pub, but there it is.</dd>
<dd>The pages (with links) and the debate were placed at the top of the recent Newsletters under <b>Issue of the Month</b> and <b>Issue of Last Month</b>. I did not go canvassing for "support" since that is not allowed under WP:Meatpuppetry(I'll find the right link, later) rules (something Project members should be careful about when an article is going for review). Lastly, and very importantly, I did not call anyone a vandal - I said actions that <i>might</i> be considered such had happened.</dd>
<dd>Well, I'm going back to the Policy pages and try and get it changed to my preferred option. It is going to be difficult because it has to be shown that the current Policy is flawed, and it has to be done by the rules. <a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 21:21, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dear LessHeard, the current policy is only what the current policy is. It will never be agreed upon wholeheartedly, ever, or ever. As you yourself said, dictionaries are 50/50 split (three against three) about it. Who are we to bicker about policy, when the professionals don't agree with each other? We should all get back to articles (meaning the GA type). Funnily enough, the FA crowd NEVER mentioned that 'The/the' problem when they failed Macca—not once.

<dd>I didn't comment mainly because most of my Wikitime lately has been spent on other matters (namely, a couple of right-wing radio talk show hosts who are aggressively pushing their POV on global warming related articles). I don't mean to offend anyone who feels strongly about the matter, but if we prioritize the work that needs to be done on Beatles-related articles using a scale of 0 to 10, my rating on the issue of "The Beatles" versus "the Beatles" would be about 0.75. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERaymond_arritt_89f0.html" title="User:Raymond arritt">Raymond Arritt</a> 22:01, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I certainly seem to be getting some flak for something that is so minor. I don't even agree with this Policy, but I disagree more strongly with it being ignored. The point about FA/GAR is good, and could be mentioned. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteelbeard1_60fd.html" title="User:Steelbeard1">User:Steelbeard1</a> is over there trying his damnest, and he is going to need more than the help I can give him against the lowercase zealots (which doesn't include McTavidge or Lukobe, who are willing to discuss) over there.</dd>

<p>I found the link. It is a short section of the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppetry_eb4f.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppetry">Wikipedia:Sock puppetry</a> policy article. Specifically it warns editors from <b>soliciting</b> editors with known viewpoints to join debates solely to increase the vote. You are probably safe regarding Project members, since most members are <i>concerned contributors</i>. If an editor hasn't contributed then it may be that their views are not suitable to be solicited. This is why I hadn't gone to any of the reviews for Mimi or Freddie, I have had no input. I have argued on the Trivia AfD's since I was already involved in previous AfD's (without being asked) - even though I have contributed little to the article. <a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 00:22, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
