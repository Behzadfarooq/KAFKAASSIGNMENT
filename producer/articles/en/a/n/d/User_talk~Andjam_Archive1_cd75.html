<p>Hi. You reverted an edit to <a href="../../../d/e/c/Declaration_of_war.html#Current_declarations" title="Declaration of war">Declaration of war#Current declarations</a> about Japan and Russia still technically being at war. As a result, I had a look at the history of the page, and I noticed that someone else had stated that the two were at war - but I wasn't knowingly restoring what they had said. I first heard of the dispute in a tv program last Tuesday (<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/content/2005/s1471328.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/content/2005/s1471328.htm" rel="nofollow">Foreign Correspondent: Kurils - Islands of Discontent</a>).</p>
<p>The CIA world factbook for <a href="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ja.html#Issues" class="external text" title="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ja.html#Issues" rel="nofollow">Japan</a> and <a href="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/rs.html#Issues" class="external text" title="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/rs.html#Issues" rel="nofollow">Russia</a> describe them as technically at war with each other.</p>
<p>There may be the argument that Russia isn't the same as the USSR (was that your argument?), but as far as I know, it regards itself as the successor of the latter.</p>

<dd>Hmm. I guess my argument is that, while they may not have ever signed a peace treaty, in reality, they aren't in a state of war anymore; a political/diplomatic land dispute over some islands isn't a war. I don't know if the countries themselves consider themselves in a state of war (although I would suppose not); if they don't, I don't think there should be any mention of them as a "Current declaration." Do you agree? I'm not sure where to find that information, though. —<a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleared_as_filed_a7db.html" title="User:Cleared as filed">Cleared as filed.</a> 12:55, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I honestly don't know. It's not an obvious one to be a featured article, but there's no inherent reason why not if it's good enough.

<p>Hey Andjam, I noticed you reverted my edits to the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_31.html" title="Channel 31">Channel 31</a> page, claiming that I removed some relevant information. The only information I could find that was not replicated locally was either totally unverifiable or outdated. If there's some info in the history that you think could be salvaged, pls copy it into the relevant page. It's hard enough to work out which channel was being discussed -- which illustrates beautifully why the channels must be split into their own pages, as they are independent entities.</p>
<p>Again, if there's something I've overlooked, pls pull it out of history and dump it into the relevant page. (and, if possible, find a verifiable source). If you've got any concerns about this, pls contact me befor reverting.</p>

<dd>That information wasn't particularly accurate: as far as I'm aware, the ABA never cited any infringements by CTS. They did, however, receive a complaint from CTA in regards to CTS' conduct. As to whether that resulted in the license suspension was not asserted. The only source listed was "media watch", although the only story Media Watch ran in regards to CTS was about the original CTA complaint, which was made in late November, 2002. The actual decision to revoke CTS' temporary license was made in March 2004. The link between the two is tenuous at best: the previous statment on the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_31.html" title="Channel 31">Channel 31</a> page indicated some kind of causal relationship.</dd>
</dl>
<p>So, I've added a little background on the <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_Sydney_37b4.html" title="Television Sydney">Television Sydney</a> page, including a link to the ABA press release.</p>
<p>Hope that suffices.</p>

<p>No clue, I'm sorry.

<p>I noticed you reverted the citation needed thingo which is fair enough. Given that to prove the somewhat bleeding obvious is nearly as hard as proving a negative can you wait a bit before striking out the alleged PoV statement?</p>
<p><br />
Also at the risk of entering into a bitter ploemic (which I certainly don't want to do) I would be interested to know exactly what your objection is to the statement that in the 1960s he was a supporter of both NS and Aust's participation in the Vn War. I don't see how it could have been otherwise. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbatross2147_b76b.html" title="User:Albatross2147">Albatross2147</a> 05:24, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I can see what you are getting at. You are probably being overly sensitive on this point but I agree that erring on the side of caution in all such matters benefits Wp generally. Would I be right that an acceptable citation would be enough to let the statement stand? <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbatross2147_b76b.html" title="User:Albatross2147">Albatross2147</a> 07:21, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I take it that it was you that inserted "—The preceding unsigned comment was added by Albatross2147 (talk • contribs)" into the midst of my comment of 10th July 2006. Everything from "This topic has been extensively" through to "some military experience" was entered at the same time AND signed by me. The gap in the test seems to have come from the fact that there was a hard return in the indented comment. Please remove the insertion as it implies I was trying to hide something - and I know you would not wish to imply something incorrectly. I also have replied to your query about citable evidence. I really wonder why you are so defensive on this point. The little bugger was up to his eyeballs in hard right politics being as he was a chip off old Athol's New Guard block. (BTW it was me that did the section on the 2GB show that was quite complimentary).</p>
<p>Incidentally I thought talk was exempt from citation but I could be wrong about that.</p>

<p>Hi Andjam, thanks for your good work on this article in trying to maintain its integrity. Can the second paragraph be improved?</p>
<ul>
<li>There are countless different news articles on the web with differing takes on what the business actually does. Should only one of these be printed here or none at all? Is internet business or advertising business sufficient enough?</li>
<li>I am only fairly new to WP and haven't yet seen an article actually publish the names of the businesses an individual is affiliated with. Yet this article does. Admittedly it is his 'alleged' business associations! Is this permitted?</li>
<li>Does WP permit most of these claims about browser hijackers/spyware etc that aren’t neutral and even worse, unreferenced?</li>
</ul>

<p>Look at when PSYCH stopped editing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/PSYCH" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/PSYCH" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> and Lefty on Campus started <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Lefty_on_campus&amp;limit=500" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Lefty_on_campus&amp;limit=500" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>. 3 days later. That appears to be quite a coincidence. <a href="../../../x/t/r/User%7EXtra_5b60.html" title="User:Xtra">Xtra</a> 04:05, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>What is your motivation behind this? I have given up on taking action after the numerous breaches in the past and the unwillingness of admins to step in and permablock IPs and Users. <a href="../../../x/t/r/User%7EXtra_5b60.html" title="User:Xtra">Xtra</a> 04:08, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The arbitration took too much effort to justify starting one up again and I only took it to arbitration because admins refused to step in other than to do short temp bans and warn both of us, but admins were reluctant to ban PSYCH once he registered. <a href="../../../x/t/r/User%7EXtra_5b60.html" title="User:Xtra">Xtra</a> 04:16, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I just thought of a difference. From memory, I think PSYCH claimed to be a law student and Lefty claims to be a psych student. <a href="../../../x/t/r/User%7EXtra_5b60.html" title="User:Xtra">Xtra</a> 04:20, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I reverted the rest of it purposely. Firstly, to my knowledge, the Red Cross policy applies nationally. It would be better to have it being ambiguous, as before, than as now to state something which is probably false (that it only applies in some states). Secondly, the other text you removed was hardly biased. It simply pointed out that the transmission risks are not greater for gay people - the core reason why this policy is seen as so discriminatory and is so controversial. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 03:53, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>OK, I'm interested - I'm aware that Marr is extremely unfond of Jones and may well have been trying to put his words in a bad light. But even allowing for that, it's hard for me to read those "Good on you"s any other way. It's not like Jones is shy about telling people when he disagrees with them. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalair_420b.html" title="User:Calair">Calair</a> 12:26, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Fair enough. I'm still of the opinion that Jones <i>did</i> mean it approvingly, but I guess it could be taken that way too. I probably would've been readier to see the other side of things if the anon hadn't started by deleting the paragraph altogether; that didn't make a good first impression on me, and I may have dug my heels in a bit too hard as a result. So thanks for offering some perspective. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalair_420b.html" title="User:Calair">Calair</a> 13:50, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Andjam,</p>
<p>Thanks for letting us know about the new FA, congratulations on that achievement! I think now we have a complete set of lists put together, we want to encourage WikiProjects to edit their own table. Some projects are already doing this, and some have even set up their own <a href="../../../w/o/r/Wikipedia%7EWorklist_fee2.html" title="Wikipedia:Worklist">worklists</a>, which we simply link to. There are now 700 WikiProjects, and it would be impossible for us to track every article from every project ourselves, but it is feasible for each project to track 5-10 articles listed with us. For example you should feel free to add and edit the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVersion_1.0_Editorial_Team_WPHobbies_a29f.html#Wikipedia:WikiProject_Australian_sports" title="Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/WPHobbies">listing for your project</a> as you see fit - your assessments will be much better than ours!</p>
<p>One check with FAs is that another WP1.0 project (FAs first) is tracking the FAs and will be involved in making sure those get into WP1.0. Coming down the road (probably very soon) we have "Release Version Qualifying", where people can nominate articles for inclusion in WP1.0.

<p>Greetings.</p>
<p>I have added an infobox to Open Hand's first album plus some recording info sourced from Trustkill's website...I always thought the album had a distinctly late 1990's feel about it. Another wikipedian has infoboxed their second. However their parent page is still in need of information. I will commence adding some information regards the members, the founding, and also their past tour dates. I'd appreciate any suggestions - a picture would also be useful, however I can only find a fairly dorky one...Myspace or a similar social enclave might have some tour pictures. Though the quality is likely to be dubious...hmm...a tough cookie. - <a href="../../../d/-/k/User%7ED-Katana_ca0b.html" title="User:D-Katana">D-Katana</a> 07:14, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are very welcome! How wonderful to talk to a person all the way from Australia! If this line stays strait it implies that Wikipedia's growth is driven by the total number of articles, not just the efforts of a few editors. I would like to write an article on the forces behind Wikipedia's growth and forecasting trends but I am not sure where to put the article.

<p>Hi Andjam - I had a look at the Italian version and it seems to be intact with no evidence of tampering. Anyway, what you quoted is actually spanish, meaning something like "Who is this prawn"? (to confuse things even more, gambero is Italian for prawn). When I went to the Spanish page, there was nothing there - so maybe it was the one that you were referring to? Maybe they took a vote and deemed it not notable (although seeing its in a few major languages already, I'm not sure how they could come to that conclusion). I hope I wasn't too late responding. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPippu_d%27angelo_0c40.html" title="User:Pippu d'angelo">ρ¡ρρµ δ→θ∑</a> - <a href="../../../../scn/p/i/p/User_talk%7EPippu_d%27Angelo_27df.html" class="extiw" title="scn:User_talk:Pippu_d'Angelo"><small>(waarom? jus'b'coz!)</small></a> 12:12, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Andjam did you really read this message to the end?:</p>
<dl>
<dd>There have been two articles that have appeared in the sports section of The Age newspaper over the last two days that are of great interest to us. In yesterday's edition, I read that Australia Post is about to release a series of stamps to celebrate the Socceroos' attempt to embark on the impossible dream (not meaning to be disrespectful, simply an honest assessment). This new series of stamps is entitled "Soccer in Australia". When the General Manager of Australia Post was asked why use the term "soccer", he simply said that it was Australia Post's view that that is the name used by the majority of Australians, and that the word football is saved for the more dominant code of a particular area, i.e. aussie rules or league.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In today's edition, there was a great article about the proposal to heritage list the Melbourne Football Club, the oldest football club in Australia (in any code) and the third oldest in the world (in any code). It was formed in 1858, the year in which we have the first recorded game of aussie rules, the game being codified in the following year, making the game older than Association Football. Interestingly, it was once thought that the Geelong Football Club was the second oldest club in Australia (formed in July 1859), but there is now new evidence indicating that the Castlemaine Football Club was in fact formed in June 1859. That makes it the 5th oldest club in the world, and Geelong the 6th oldest club in the world. I thought to myself as I read this: How appropriate that a club evocatively called "Castlemaine" (part of a gold mining region in central Victoria) should have such an honour. It is possible that the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">Football</a> article may need to be reviewed, but I mention it here just in case: 1. I run into difficulties (as I undoubtedly will), and 2. Someone out there has access to a better (or simply another) reference than this Age article.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you had, you would have noticed that in fact it is about wikipedia. I refer to an article, and I make a direct request for further references on top of the one I had just mentioned. Now you may not like the fact that I took a long time to get there, or you might find the whole subject boring, all points with which I might be able to agree - but the reasoning you gave in the edit summary was in fact false - it seems a shabby way to treat someone fast approaching 20,000 wiki edits. Do you prefer only those part of your cosy club to form part of the notice board? Is it more a question of style? Of not fitting a certain mould? You may have thought the title of the section was not appropriate, which is fair enough, but you should then provide a more accurate description of your motivation in the edit summary. Or is it simply a case of: "I didn't like it, and that will suffice"? It would be appreciated if you could provide me with the real reason why you deleted the section. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPippu_d%27angelo_0c40.html" title="User:Pippu d'angelo">ρ¡ρρµ δ→θ∑</a> - <a href="../../../../scn/p/i/p/User_talk%7EPippu_d%27Angelo_27df.html" class="extiw" title="scn:User_talk:Pippu_d'Angelo"><small>(waarom? jus'b'coz!)</small></a> 04:03, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Andjam: Thanks for your comment. It says at the top of the page that this is not a voting procedure. The second "keep" was for an entirely new point. My understanding is, that it is the points made for and against the deletion proposal that count, not the number of people who make them. Perhaps you should remove the message you placed under my "keep", because it may mislead others into thinking that this is a ballot system. --<a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPureLogic_0f7c.html" title="User:PureLogic">PureLogic</a> 16:46, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Andjam, thanks for asking me. I suggest you leave it in. It might not be a vote, however, it is consensus, and double voting, double commenting, or however you describe it, is wrong if the person making such a comment highlights both comments with a bolded <b>Keep</b>. If PureLogic wants to make an additional comment, he is well within his rights to do so, however, he should preface such additional comments with <b>Comment:</b> or with no heading at all. Having a duplicate heading is deceptive. Wikilawyering aside, seeing two comments with the same heading can lead to AfD closers to misinterpret the consensus. I found your comment useful, because most of us go through dozens of AfDs, and don't have time to mark down the unique users making comments on these things. Keep on doing what you're doing.

<dd>Oh, and if we want to get technical about it, AfD is not a vote, however, for convenience, we often call comments that request an action (for example, <b>Keep</b>, <b>Delete</b>, <b>Merge and redirect</b>, <b>Redirect</b>, etc.) "votes" for convenience. They are still not "votes" in the strictest sense of the word.&#160;;-) --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 17:18, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is a pre-Atlanta version. I have the pre-Sydney version by ABC books. <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0 7333 0884 8</a>. The picture on the cover is of Susie O'Neill doing butterfly. There is an article on every Olympics which Australia has attended, but the winter ones are only two paragraphs each as Australia didn't win any medals until 1994. The bios are usually only medallists + some notable/ununusual non-medalists. I was thinking of Jacqui Cooper and Kirstie Marshall, but they don't even have entries. Probably <i>Australia and the Olympic Games</i> by Harry Gordon is a better bet. At the moment there are only six missing in the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Olympic_medalists_in_Swimming_dd96.html" title="Australian Olympic medalists in Swimming">Australian Olympic medalists in Swimming</a> and I've added about 90-100 of them so I was hoping to finish it off. I think I made a bit of a premature FLC nom for it and didn't anticipate being swamped with about 15-20 messages and some help requests everyday since becoming an admin, so I apologize for the delay.

<p>I'm getting rather frustrated at your new tendency of popping up on articles where there has never been any issue before and making allegations of bad faith. The post at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_bisexual_people.html" title="List of bisexual people">list of bisexual people</a> is a prime example - you immediately assumed that it was there as part of someone staking a claim on the article, instead of a little bit of good faith and realising that it was probably a matter of oversight.</p>
<p>While I'm not accusing you of being a homophobe as such, you have made persistently biased edits on the topic, often without checking your facts (the blood bank issue at <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay_rights_in_Australia_8cce.html" title="Gay rights in Australia">Gay rights in Australia</a> being a prime example). On other occasions, it feels to me like you're just being downright provocative, as with your latest edits to <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danny_Nalliah_22fc.html" title="Danny Nalliah">Danny Nalliah</a>. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 11:22, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The article about McCosker is not about the courtcase. It barely mentions it at all, and doesn't do so by name, mentioning only that it was overturned on "constitutional grounds". While there may be a case for notability here, the article as it stands seems to exist only because someone found him being a gay pedophile very interesting. I'll let it stand for the moment because AYArktos agreed that he was notable, but if the article isn't fixed up to make a more compelling case for notability soon, I'll nominate it for AfD.</p>
<p>More broadly, however, I've been thinking about the Nalliah disputes. It seems to me that you've come to the conclusion somehow that because I identify as queer, I must be rabidly anti-conservative. Yet this is simply not true - up until the civil union override, I was very seriously considering joining the Liberal Party, and I'll still be <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_legislative_election%2C_2006.html" title="Victorian legislative election, 2006">voting for them in November</a>. This is why I get very frustrated when you read everything I write about conservative people in a confrontational light, and consistently read implications into my prose that either a) aren't there, or b) that I didn't intend to be there. Last night was a good example of this - you seemed to be suggesting that, by mentioning the National Party, I was trying to make some reflection on them, when I was simply trying to point out where Joyce was coming from for anyone who doesn't already know who he is. I realise that I've been quite brusque with this, and I apologise for that, but I'd really appreciate a few more assumptions of good faith. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 02:09, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Based on that, it does sound like there could be a good case for notability, but the article doesn't make it particularly well. Could it be possible to focus it more on the twin issues of the lack of government support and the legal action?</p>
<p>Please don't insult my intelligence. Your edits at Danny Nalliah have not been limited to the word "conservative", so I'm still wondering what the motivation is behind your assumptions of an ulterior motive with the rest of the issues raised there. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 02:56, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

I'm not a fan of many of the people I write about, but that doesn't mean what I write is biased. I'm tired of being jumped on for having allegedly implied things that just aren't there, or that I didn't intend to be there, simply because I don't actually like Nalliah. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 03:17, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Nloth, Yahnatan, Andjam, PeruvianLlama,</p>
<p>There's another POV pusher on the <a href="../../../c/a/i/CAIR_c159.html" title="CAIR">CAIR</a> article; I'm contacting you because you've recently been involved in maintaining the article. I've tried to talk things out with the guy, but he remains dedicated to removing important information from the article, and I don't have the time to deal with his long screeds and shifting rationales. Could you maybe help out here? I confess I've lost my patience with him, but would be happy to help if you could join in the discussion and brewing edit war.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

I see you and Sdedeo are "forming an alliance" to resist any additonal changes to the article on CAIR. This is intellectual dishonesty.</p>
<p><br />
Not only are you offering excuses but accusing me of "removing important information." I did not remove any info. only edited some parts to which you are accusing me of not following "NPOV." Please stop making excuses and threatening to block me. Those are bullying tactics. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.225.226.57.html" title="User:24.225.226.57">24.225.226.57</a> (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.225.226.57.html" title="User talk:24.225.226.57">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.225.226.57_4f67.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.225.226.57">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>I told you that was done out of mistake, not out of malicious intent. What's malicious is you and Sdedeo trying to team up to prevent any reasonable improvements to the article. Like I said, prove to me where my entire edits have NPOV, that would justify you from removing it.</p>

<p>I didn't say the vandalism was "not recent", but that both of them had "stopped vandalising" by the time final warnings were issued to them. We don't need to block if the vandal has stopped after the last warning.

<p>No, it doesn't. The removal of warnings on his own talk page occurred after I removed the report from AIV. The report was there for a good 12 minutes. At the worst if he insists on removing warnings his talk page may be protected, but the fact is, he was warned only 3 times for vandalism recently (including blanking his talk page). That is insufficient warning to merit a block. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimchi.sg_959a.html" title="User:Kimchi.sg">Kimchi.sg</a> 17:32, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't have any problems with people editing articles about matters in which they are involved, or even articles about themselves, provided they declare their interest. I edit the article on the ALP even though I am an ALP member, but everyone knows I am a member so I couldn't get away with partisan editing even if I was minded to do it. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 13:28, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would appreciate it if you don't go around accusing people of doing partisan editing. I find you are the POV party restricting me from editing CAIR from a neutral perspective, including black listing me as a "sock puppet." Please stop trying everything in your book to prevent me from contributing to Wikipedia. That's taking a page from Daniel Pipes work. Tyruler 23:54, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><br />
I've been in this from the very start so.. <b>This be the Legend</b>:</p>
<p>Ok, so, one sunny day long, long ago (11:43, 26 June 2006), I posted the article Trigger Happy (<a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Archive47_7f55.html#Trigger_Happy" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Archive47">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Archive47#Trigger Happy</a> ) on the <a href="../../../v/p/p/WP%7EVPP_9f2a.html" title="WP:VPP">WP:VPP</a> page and also on the Administrators' noticeboard. Little did I know the response that I would get. At the end of my article I wrote: If I don't cop flack for this one, I will climb the Reichtag Bulding in a Spiderman outfit. This was the response:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please provide a photo of your climbing the Reichstag in a Spiderman outfit. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i><b>/</b>/<b>/</b></i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">type</span></a></small></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When will you be climbing the Reichstag? I'll try to be around.(and could provide the photo then) <a href="../../../l/e/c/User%7ELectonar_ddf9.html" title="User:Lectonar">Lectonar</a></li>

</dl>
<p>At this stage Wikipedia:No climbing the Reichstag dressed as Spiderman was just a link to the Hoax page. I decided then to indulge <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto">User:Proto</a> and actualy digitaly edited a photo of myself climbing the Reichtag Bulding in a Spiderman outfit. I then posted this on the same page with the remark "Ok, but you forced me into this. Scaling a major landmark is harder than it looks". The original image has since been deleted as it violates copyright.</p>

<p>It was at this stage that <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> took it to a new level. Gone was the re-direct and those considering climbing the Reichstag in a Spiderman outfit could only tremble in fear in the shadow of the <b>New Wikipedia:No climbing the Reichstag dressed as Spiderman</b> page. People started going there, mainly out of curiosity, and we soon realized that we had created a monster.</p>
<p>I was then <a href="../../../b/a/l/WP%7EBALLS_8227.html" title="WP:BALLS">indefinitely bollocked</a> for violating policy (<a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_climbing_the_Reichstag_dressed_as_Spiderman_115c.html" title="Wikipedia:No climbing the Reichstag dressed as Spiderman">Wikipedia:No climbing the Reichstag dressed as Spiderman</a>). <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 10:25, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>A long battle ensued as to wheter we should keep the page on this fine website. With the help of countless people and of course the Rouge Admin and their mighty Cabal we won and here it is. The offical score was 13 points and a log to 27 points a brused backside and 3 ripped dresses.</p>
<p>And that, my children is how a rag-tag group of Wikipedeians got together and formed the <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_climbing_the_Reichstag_dressed_as_Spiderman_115c.html" title="Wikipedia:No climbing the Reichstag dressed as Spiderman">Wikipedia:No climbing the Reichstag dressed as Spiderman</a> page. There has been countless contributors and the battle still rages on many fronts but in the end, I think it is worth it to keep the Reichstag Spider-man free.</p>

<ul>
<li>One problem I find with wikipedia is when it does not cite its references. What is your attitude towards uncited content?</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Real encyclopaedias do not provide references: they</i> are <i>references. They do not need references because readers trust their reputation for accuracy. If Wikipedia had a reputation for accuracy it wouldn't need references. Sadly, it <a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/node/50902" class="external text" title="http://www.theonion.com/content/node/50902" rel="nofollow">does not</a>. Until it does, references will be needed for matters about which there is disagreement. If I write "Jacques Chirac is the President of France" this does not need a reference, because it is not in dispute. If I write "Jacques Chirac is a corrupt treacherous old scumbag," this does need a reference, despite being a perfectly true statement, because some people may doubt its truth.</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Some people have pretty much stopped using ISP-based email these days outside of work, since most web accounts are large enough for all they need. There would be work-related email addresses, but that would bring with it the disadvantages of using a real name. An insistance on using real names would be a problem. Some people who edit on perfectly innocent topics prefer using pseudonyms, as have historically many respectable authors of fiction. If they prefer anonymity, what about those writing about national socialism or Islamism?</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Everybody editing Wikipedia should be required to provide their real name in a veriable form. I'm not a techhead so I don't have a proposal on how to do this, but it must be done if Wikipedia is to be saved from cranks and cultists. It will be objected that this will deter many people from editing. Too bad. There are 6 billion people in the world. I'm sure we can find enough of them who are willing to edit under their real names to produce a very nice encyclopaedia. The rest can go edit Whackopedia and good luck to them.</i></p>
<ul>
<li>One thing I would be interested in is for admins to have an option to ban mildly troublesome anon IPs editing articles but still being allowed to edit talk pages. (Yes, banning them altogther would be your preference, but in the meantime...)</li>
</ul>
<p><i>I don't see the point in half-measures or "in the meantimes". Wikipedia should be a gated community of people with both the desire and the ability to make a useful contribution to creating an encyclopaedia, whether by writing 10,000 word articles or by correcting one semi-colon. People who have neither the desire nor the ability should be got rid of as quickly and as politely as possible.</i></p>
