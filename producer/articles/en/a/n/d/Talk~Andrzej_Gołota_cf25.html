<dd>Yes, and Kościuszko is known to Americans as Kosciusko while Modrzejewska i called Modjeska. However, these were not the names of these people. It's not the case of English vs. original spelling, it's a case of original spelling vs. common mistake. His official webpage uses his original name in its English version and Gołota is still a Polish citizen. I think we should use the name he uses himself (apparently) and he's got in his papers, not the one used by some of the American newspapers. We don't translate names just for the sake of it, I believe you wouldn't move an article on <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johann_Sebastian_Bach_d0b5.html" title="Johann Sebastian Bach">Johann Sebastian Bach</a> to John Sebastien Bach just because those names have their equivalent in English. I'll ask one of the admins to move this article to where it belongs.

<dd>RickK is correct. If you go to his <a href="http://www.golota.pl/index.php?newlang=english" class="external text" title="http://www.golota.pl/index.php?newlang=english" rel="nofollow">official website at www.golota.pl</a>, while the graphic has <i>Andrzej Golota</i> on the top of the English section, <b>he is listed as</b> <i><b>Andrew Golota</b></i> <b>throughout the text.</b> Therefore, the page is in the correct location as it is -- it needs to stay at <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Golota_13da.html" title="Andrew Golota">Andrew Golota</a> with a redirect at <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrzej_Golota_606d.html" title="Andrzej Golota">Andrzej Golota</a>. It is <b>not</b> the same as <i>John Sebastien Bach</i> by any stretch of the imagination.</dd>

<dd>He is not referred to as Andrew Golota by his site, he is referred to as such by american boxing portals (check the source of all the info). There is a difference. Also, what is the difference between Kościuszko's name and the name of Gołota? Neither of them changed the name, both of them are called by the Americans in a simplified way. Does it mean that all encyclopedias should use nick-names rather than names? Let's move <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolph_Hitler_82be.html" title="Adolph Hitler">Adolph Hitler</a> to <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler.html" title="Hitler">Hitler</a> or <a href="../../../f/u/e/Fuehrer.html" title="Fuehrer">Fuehrer</a> since that is how an average American calls him. Or perhaps we should move <a href="../../../w/e/r/Wernher_von_Braun_52ea.html" title="Wernher von Braun">Wernher von Braun</a> to Vinnie, because that's how his American pals called him?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I do not say that he is not referred to in America as Andrew Golota. What I say is that Andrew Golota is not his name, it is but a nick-name. Encyclopedias should follow strict naming rules. One of such rules should be to name articles after names, not nick-names.

<dd>You didn't read my arguments either, did you. What I wanted to say (perhaps I failed in stating it clearly enough, I'm sorry if this is the case) is that the name the guy has in his passport and ID card seems more important that the name used by some newspapers or portals. I have yet to see a proof that either Gołota changed his name officially or at least uses the anglicized spelling himself. Other than that - I believe that this article should be at <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrzej_Golota_606d.html" title="Andrzej Golota">Andrzej Gołota</a>, since that is the name he has in his documents and I never ever heard of Gołota refering to himself as "Andrew Golota". Do I make myself clear? Or are there still some nuances of my statements that need to be explained a bit?

<dd>I admit that I was wrong, most of the articles quoted by his page ('though not the authors of the page itself) use the americanised spelling. However, this does not change anything, the guys still has different name. For me the americanised spelling of non-American names is sort of a nick-name. If so, the articles should have redirects pointing to the true names. However, perhaps you have other idea as to how should we name articles on wikipedia.</dd>

<dd>Hey, he is known worldwide as Andrew Golota. Who are they gonna look for when they are looking in the Internet for, Adrezki Golota or Andrew Golota? Our whole purpose is to educate the masses and maybe attract more contributors. And Andrew Golota shpuld stay as Andrew Golota cause, if not, then <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Jordan_c952.html" title="Michael Jordan">Michael Jordan</a> should be changed to Michael Jeffrey Jordan as well!

<p>Golota's behavior did not go over well with the crowd, who booed and threw objects at him as he walked off towards his dressing room.</p>
