We've spent too much time on this. We're feeding the trolls. Yes, f silsor <i>had</i> spelled out his arguments (assuming they exist) that would have been preferable. But I think that the best thing would have been low-key response. On one ond of the possibility spectrum is that this is a carefully thought social experiment, on the other is that it's a mal-adaptive attention seeking device. Whatever it is, I'd prefer to not make a fuss until it's <i>actually</i> hurting something.<br />

<p>Since you deleted my complaint Wikipedia:Requests for comment/personal attacks by Ambi could tell me what was the out come? as I never had the chance to see any comments being unable to get internet for 24 hours. Does Ambi have to the right to abuse me? Is she exempt from abuse rules? This is a bit like a court case where your not allowed to take part and defend oneself. Could you return the comments (some ten I see) as I believe I have the right toe see them.

<dd>Please review the policy laid out at <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a>, particularly <i>Any RfC not accompanied by evidence showing that <b>two users</b> tried and failed to resolve the same dispute may be deleted after <b>48 hours</b></i> and <i>RfCs which are brought solely to harass or subdue an adversary are highly frowned upon by the community. Repetitive, burdensome and unwarranted filing of meritless RfCs is an abuse of the Wikipedia dispute resolution process. RfC is not a venue for personal attack. Filing an RfC over a matter that other users regard as trivial or inappropriate may diminish their opinion of you or may cause them to file an RfC against you</i> (emphasis added).</dd>
<dd>There was no "outcome", as an RfC is not equivalent to a court case. It is a <i>request for comments</i>, just an informal discussion with no "outcome" or decision, binding or otherwise. However, the general reaction from most commenters was that it was a frivolous RfC. I'm a bit baffled by your question "And why wasnt I asked to comment?" Your comments started the process in the first place. I have no intentions of undeleting the RfC, as I'm unaware of any policy that would allow me to do so. Feel free to ask at <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a>.</dd>
<dd>A few sarcastic remarks from another user do not constitute grounds for an RfC. You'll note that <i>two</i> people are required to certify that they tried to resolve the <i>same</i> dispute with another user in order for an RfC to remain open. You'd be better off trying to resolve this through <a href="../../../r/f/m/WP%7ERFM_dd02.html" title="WP:RFM">mediation</a>. <i><b><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a></b></i><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="green">ndroid</font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="purple">79</font></a> 13:25, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is more benign, I had it as a place where I could keep evidence in case of any potential rfars(now that i'm actually a plantiff in one, I rarely use it, ironically enough), as well as a place to remind myself of instances on the good users here.</p>

<dd>You might be right, I think the biggest reason why it's still there at all is what I saw as condescending bullying by <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> regarding it. If he just asked politely for me to get rid of it, I probably would have, but now I don't know since that might be seen as caving in to him.(i'm like a chinese finger trap IMO: pull and it gets tighter, don't pull and it gets loose.)</dd>

<p>As for <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, i've removed several users from the "bad" side of the page, I removed Borisblue last night after we had a good talk thanks to <a href="../../../p/i/g/User%7EPigsonthewing_3a5b.html" title="User:Pigsonthewing">Pigs</a>, and I <i>nominated</i> MONGO for adminship even though he was on it just a few months ago. Remember the A in AGF, it's still just an assumption in a "when in doubt" situation. It's not a clear thing.</p>
<p>That page has been deteriorating anyhow, and the past few weeks have been making it worse. I have an idea on how both sides can save face here, perhaps I can put anything worthwhile there onto a Word file on my hard drive. I'm not 100% since it seemed to help remind <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorisblue_1bc2.html" title="User:Borisblue">Borisblue</a> that he went a bit too far, but ultimately the goal of it is to act as a tool, not to cause division and derision.

<p>"Remington and the Rattlesnakes" is the "North Carolina Vandal". Curps remembers him, Joy Stovall, and probably a number of others too; I've made several posts about him on AN/I as well as ViP since at least June, though he's been active longer than that, and I've blocked innumerable sockpuppets of him. His editing style and target articles give him away. Look at <i>any</i> contribution from a 63.19.xxx.xxx IP on any North Carolina related article (for example, Stokes County, North Carolina: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stokes_County%2C_North_Carolina&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stokes_County%2C_North_Carolina&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> --there's a list of some of his socks on a long vandalism spree), as well as <a href="../../../l/u/x/Luxembourg.html" title="Luxembourg">Luxembourg</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mississippi.html" title="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elitism.html" title="Elitism">elitism</a> (this gives it away, but there are hundreds of examples like this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elitism&amp;diff=20375081&amp;oldid=20156506" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elitism&amp;diff=20375081&amp;oldid=20156506" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>), as well as his obsession with "croboys" and so forth, all of which appears in his vandalism history, as well as on his current user page. He is really one of the most prolific vandals in the history of our project, if you count up all the 63.19 vandalism. For a while he just played in the sandbox (look at all the 63.19 edits there in the last several weeks) but now he's come out, and he's trying being a POV warrior rather than a blatant vandal. I can accumulate a small mountain of evidence on him; it's easy, because he says the same things in all his vandalism. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 04:40, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>...and more. If you look at the very end of his contribution history, he registered about a dozen usernames (eg User:JhY51681), editted the sandbox with them once, then editted their user pages from the Remington account. There's also the user:Jake Remington account that the username is supposedly based on too. Very strange. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndium_9d5c.html" title="User:Indium">Indium</a> 04:53, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You shouldn't set a colour without also setting a high- contrast background coour (what if your text is yellow, and a visually - impaired user has set their background colour to be yellow?); you shouldn't change the colour of links from the user's default (or, at least, from the default of the site they're on).
