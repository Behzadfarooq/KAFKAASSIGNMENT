<dd>Vandalism I'm afraid. Welcome to Wikipedia.  :) If you ever see anything confusing like this in the future, have a quick check on a page's history to see if any of the recent changes added it. Usually it's anonymous IP users doing this sort of thing. And if you're convinced that it's vandalism, please just go ahead and revert it. It's irritating, but the utility of WP outweighs it.

that may be true but let me just say that NYC has not been the same after warhol died. something died in the big apple when he did. RIP...</p>
<p>simplistic and misleading; Duchamp never simply pointed at something and called it art....He abstracted the real life object,placed it in other than its natural environment and often altered it.re R.Crumb toilet bowl furthermore he signed the newly *(de)contructed object basically saying 'The answer to the question of 'what is art is Art is.Art is what I do". Just who credited Warhol with the ,'deceptively simple notion .....etc etc'?and when or where did Andy (I,m allowed) simply take an object is its original form and present it as a finished work (Lilac electric chairs????)

<dd>Regarding your assertion that "Duchamp never simply pointed at something and called it art": you are mistaken; he did precisely that. He even went around later in his life taking random objects and signing his name on them, thus turning them into "works of art". -- <a href="../../../d/o/m/User%7EDominus_070e.html" title="User:Dominus">Dominus</a> 05:36, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As far as I know, the concept of readymades evolved from Dada ideas. Dada-ists used garbage, newspaper-clippings, Objets Trouvees as material to make art. The objet trouvee already contains the "pop" idea of using everyday materials - like newspapers - instead of more classical materials - like paint and canvas. Duchamp added to this concept by using readymades, he also gave the idea a theoretical context. Warhol added to this development by using readymade concepts. He took well-known concepts, not necessarily their material representatives, and made them the subjects of his works. I would say that Warhol used ideas and images in a similar way that Duchamp used objects. In other words, Warhol or Duchamp may or may not be credited with something, but their "pointing and calling it art" is part of a development that didn't start or stop with their work. Art-historians tend to talk about readymades as belonging to Duchamp. Warhol is credited for incorporating popular ideas and methods into art. <a href="../../../s/m/q/User%7ESmqt_277b.html" title="User:Smqt">Smqt</a></p>

<p>I'm not positive which one is right, but the introductory paragraph places the Factory in Union Square (which is on 14th Street), while the next paragraph places it at 47th Street. This should probably be cleared up. --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHypnotic31_f4cd.html" title="User:Hypnotic31">Hypnotic31</a> 04:14, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>This may seem minor but, the article states "The Factory, located at 221 East 47th Street in Manhattan, was Warhol's studio from 1963 to 1967" then goes on to say "The Factory became a meeting place of artists and would-be artists such as <a href="../../../m/i/c/Mick_Jagger_1896.html" title="Mick Jagger">Mick Jagger</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/u/Lou_Reed_999a.html" title="Lou Reed">Lou Reed</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Bowie_5100.html" title="David Bowie">David Bowie</a>, and <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truman_Capote_e210.html" title="Truman Capote">Truman Capote</a>. I don't think it is accurate to describe <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truman_Capote_e210.html" title="Truman Capote">Truman Capote</a> as a would-be artist in 1963--he was a well established writer by then.</p>
<p>REPLY: Warhol moved. His first location was dubbed the Silver Factory because it was painted silver. He moved because his business grew, and he wanted a more business-like approach. The Silver Factory is where all the parties were. All kinds of strangers and strange people hung out, and even lived there. When it became too crowded, and Warhol became more famous, he changed location and adopted a more restrictive policy as to who was welcome in the Factory.</p>
<p>About Capote, he was famous before Warhol, and Warhol was a fan of his. He has written postcards to Capote asking to meet him.</p>
<p><br />
"As a famous artist, Warhol and his Factory attracted and facilitated many "groupies" and friends that Warhol would take with him when going out to smoke weed". I was under the impression that Warhol and the Factory were into speed and other uppers, and not marijuana. Also, they had a whole studio to use as a drug-pad, so I doubt that they would "go out" to smoke. <a href="../../../s/y/l/User%7ESylvea_d769.html" title="User:Sylvea">Sylvea</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>That's correct on both counts. The Factory is famous for the use of speed. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshacconci_f743.html" title="User:Freshacconci">Freshacconci</a> 21:35, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In some of his books Warhol talks about taking drugs quite freely, although not often. Writing about his use of drugs generally suggests that he wasn't that much into drugs, although he didn't avoid them. I think statements that insinuate he was "leading" in the taking of drugs are misleading: i.e. " that Warhol would take with him when going out to smoke weed". I think this way of writing misrepresents Warhol's role in the Factory group. He was a leader, but not in by way of being an "instigitor". <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../s/m/q/User%7ESmqt_277b.html" title="User:Smqt">Smqt</a> (<a href="../../../s/m/q/User_talk%7ESmqt_f4a9.html" title="User talk:Smqt">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Smqt_8cef.html" title="Special:Contributions/Smqt">contribs</a>) 04:18, 18 December 2006 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>Good question, though I've only ever heard it pronounced "War-Hole". Does anyone know how Andy Warhol himself pronounced it? That's the best guide really I reckon (i.e. it doesn't matter how it's pronounced in the country the name ultimately comes from). --<a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPlumbago_5505.html" title="User:Plumbago">Plumbago</a> 11:06, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Since Warhol was American, it's probably best to go with Wor-hall/War-hall (per Pittsburg and New York above). However, Bowie's pronunciation is also a factor of his accent. In a sence, there's no "correct" pronunciation (is Bowie wrong to pronounce it that way?) just regional variations. I think I've always said War-hall (or I think that's the way I say it--it's probably closer to Woor-haahll. A propros of nothing, I once met someone from Rhode Island who made fun of the way I pronounced Boston, which came out Baahstaahn, really long vowels). <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshacconci_f743.html" title="User:Freshacconci">Freshacconci</a> 15:30, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The statement "In the 1970s and 1980s he mainly made prints of famous people such as Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley" is incorrect. The Monroe and Presley paintings/silkscreens (along with the Jackie Kennedy and Elizabeth Taylor) date from the '60s. Warhol's 1970s output is dominated by commissioned portraiture, and the changed impetus behind the work (playing unbidden with cultural icons vs. flattering celebrities for money) led to a different kind of image, with a different resonance.</p>
<p>There are also many other Warhol series and works to discuss here, including his death paintings (car crashes, the famous electric chair), cow wallpaper, oxidation paintings and late-period collaborations with Jean-Michel Basquiat. And much else.</p>

<p>wasn't he born in forest hills, pa?</p>
<p>I've seen it as "Forest City", PA (in a PBS program) - but most often he is described as having been born in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>There is also mention in several biographies of him being born in McKeesport, PA. His exact birthplace was shrouded in mystrey by Warhol, who stated that he was born in Pennsylvania or near Pittsburg most of the time.</p>
<p>I am from Forest City, PA, and there are still Warhols living here. It's pretty certain that he was born here and his family moved to Pittsburgh when he was 3. He probably didn't want people to know that he came from such a poor "coal mining town." I think this needs a little more research, and I have heard that his birth certificate does say Forest City, PA. I have no hard proof, but it must be out there because there is no other reason for a town of 2,852 people to be mentioned. This requires more research.</p>

<p>I think it's a bit overdone to have this extensive a filmography, because Warhol is best known as a painter and his paintings and painting style have had a much more apparent influence than his films... Maybe just name the most famous ones? Empire State building, blowjob, cowboys?</p>

<p>Okay, I'm going to need to disagree here on the films. As important as the paintings are, the films have always been crucial to his overall practice. The films up to 1968 should be given an equal place in the ouvre (afer '68 he steps back from the films and leaves them to Paul Morrissey).<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshacconci_f743.html" title="User:Freshacconci">Freshacconci</a> 21:40, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Even if the films are important to his work, his paintings are what he is most known for to the general public. In older versions of the text, only a few of his paintings were mentioned, yet there was a complete filmography. Anyway, I think the way the article is developing the problem is more or less solved, since there's also more attention for his work as a painter.</dd>

<p>Is says now (Okt 2005) that "On June 3, 1968, Valerie Solanas, a Factory regular, entered Warhol's studio and fired three shots at Warhol, nearly killing him. Although the first two rounds missed, the third passed through Warhol's left lung, spleen, stomach, liver, esophagus and right lung."</p>
<p>I'm not really big on anatomy, but I don't believe this is physically possible. The bullet went through him, bounced back and hit him again?</p>
<p>He might have been shot on his left side, in which case I believe all those injuries are very well possible with one bullet. - Hbdragon88 06:53, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The article is, in actuallity, incorrect. 2 bullets passed through him, not 1. the 3rd bullet was unsuccesful in hitting Warhol.</p>

<p>Since Warhol died in 1987, it must have been five years at most, which isn't "many years" in my book, and I doubt anyone else's. Did Warhol maintain "a friendship with the band (and especially keyboardist Nick Rhodes)" for several years before 1982? Otherwise, "for many years" should be changed, to, e.g., "for the rest of his life." 88.110.121.116 23:03, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article claims that "Warhol "wrote" several books." Why is 'wrote' in quotation marks? Did he not actually write the books himself? Was he dictating? Either way, there needs to be an explanation as this is not very helpful.</p>
<p>He dictated his diar to Pat Hackett, mostly over the phone. She's also credited for editing. He started keeping a diary to keep track of expenses for tax puroses. A, A Novel is a litteral transcription of audio recordings of Ondine and other people, spelling and interpretation errors were left in the final book, as well as weird interpunction, "uhm"s etcetera. When people asked Warhol for a job, sometimes he would just let them type out his audio tapes. From A To B, I'm not sure, but I think some of his friends - Brigid Berlin (Polk), the B in the Title - wrote this book together, kind of like a group-ghost-writer. --<a href="../../../s/m/q/User%7ESmqt_277b.html" title="User:Smqt">Smqt</a> 16 December 2005</p>

<p>I didn't add that, but I did read an article about a study in this direction, I think Warhol was posthumously declared to have been autistic. I've always considered these stories as a myth being born; since he was very stoic, he gained a kind of Alice-in-Wonderland-quality; the stupid boy, accidentally stumbeling into a rainbow.

<p>Autism isn't an indicator of a low IQ. It is an indicator of average to high IQ. Often times, "creative geniuses" are autistic. The average artist has an IQ of 153.</p>
<dl>
<dd>That statement is false. 70% of people with autism have mental retardation, or an IQ below 70. You are probably referring to the savant or aspergers syndrome. I'm afraid Rainman has made 90% of people believe that autism is paired with intellect, when in reality, savants account for an estimated 5 percent of all people who are autistic. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_undertow_1022.html" title="User:The undertow">The undertow</a> 02:23, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the first paragraph, the article reads: "In the 35 minute film Blow Job (1963), he shows the face of David Pelman receiving fellatio." This is incorrect. The camera never pans below the man's waist and the viewer never knows whether he is receiving fellatio or not. This invocation of the spectator is an idea central to Warhol's work. I don't have the time to find sources, but a quick google produced this one hit: <a href="http://www.geraldpeary.com/essays/wxyz/warhol.html" class="external free" title="http://www.geraldpeary.com/essays/wxyz/warhol.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geraldpeary.com/essays/wxyz/warhol.html</a></p>
<p>The actor in Blow Job is DeVerne Bookwalter. This is in Andy Warhol Screen Tests: The Films of Andy Warhol Catalogue Raisonne, by Callie Angell. I corrected the reference to this in the entry.<a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJudyholliday_a86a.html" title="User:Judyholliday">Judyholliday</a> 01:04, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As a student in the cited author's class, I can confirm the above statements regarding fellatio in the film <i>Blow Job</i>. The film emphasizes off-screen activity by never showing it. The only indication during the movie that the audience is witnessing a blow job is the title. // <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontag451_ffbc.html" title="User:Montag451">Montag</a> 19:37, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>In the third paragraph, the article reads: "Other important films include My Hustler, Midnight Cowboy, and Lonesome Cowboys". I think a year citation should follow "My Hustler" (the same goes for "Bad" in the 6th paragraph). Also, Warhol had nothing to do with Midnight Cowboy and there's no reason the movie should be mentioned in the article.</p>

<p>I just got so fed up I did a big enormous edit anonomously, so I thought I'd sign in and put this under the comments section. I have spent years researching Andy Warhol and reading biographies and autobiographies (even the boring diaries) and frankly the comments about his sexuality are wrong. There is no proof as to any sexuality (a, gay, or otherwise) at all. I even did some more research on the net before editing and frankly the comments that he "wasn't accepted by the church because he was gay" and was involved with the actor in "Sleep", etc, were all unfounded. Feel free to argue with me, but most of the people that were very close to him refuse to reveal (or just don't know) what his sexual preference was. Thus, declaring him gay is completely undocumented by any reliable source (and you can find many many others that say the opposite). Even though there is another section on "The Factory", I feel this section lacks in that entire era, but perhaps that's a space issue. - Sharkeysday</p>

<dd>Well, I ceratainly knew a number of men that socialized with him in the 1950s and more than one that had gay sex with him during that period and I have never heard anything that would lead me to beilieve that he was bisexual. <a href="../../../d/_/c/User%7ED_C_McJonathan_b121.html" title="User:D C McJonathan">Doc</a> 23:13, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Aside from gay, the only other way I've ever heard him described as is asexual (but with a nod to occasional gay relationships). Admittedly, I'm no Warhol scholar (to say the least), but I don't think the article should rewrite the conventional view of him (which is pretty established, and uncontested by him as far as I can tell). By all means add a clarifying <i>remark</i> about ambiguity (referenced if possible), but the current state is unsatisfactory I reckon.

<dd>The anon-editing was a mistake. I have no problem identifying myself, I'm just new at editing anything on wikipedia or I would have signed in first! (thus this post). Interesting that you knew someone who had Gay sex with him. I've actually studied, written papers and been a follower of Andy Warhols for years and have never seen any documentation about anyone doing anything but seeing him watch sexual encounters. I'd be interested to know if this person would openly admit to it. I also think people (especially maybe in the 60's and 70's) have a hard time seperating "effeminate" and "gay". Andy Warhol was certianly "effeminate" but his sexuality still remains a question and I have never seen a reputable source able to define him as gay. He had no problem with gay men and was frankly open to all sorts of interesting sexual relations, but most of his closest friends were just that...friends. I think the asexual definition is probably the most appropriate, if you have to define him at all. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7ESharkeysday_5d89.html" title="User:Sharkeysday">User:Sharkeysday</a> 7:32, 15 June 2006</dd>

<dd>Yes, I do understand the complexity of the issue and I agree that he was largely asexual, a voyeur and had many gay friends, that were just that. The one that I knew the most about was a man from Greenwich, Connecticut, an artist and musician, during the 1950s that had a relationship that was sexual, which lasted for some months. He unfortunately has passed on himself now. He had several of Andy's paintings of shoes and no reason to fabricate. There were one or two others as well. While I did meet Andy in groups, my casual observation would be that control &amp; psychological elements were more inportant to him than the the physical. <a href="../../../d/_/c/User%7ED_C_McJonathan_b121.html" title="User:D C McJonathan">Doc</a> 16:13, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One clear source (to provide at least one, because I don't have my books handy) is in Reed's song "small town": "bad skin, bad eyes, gay and fatty". This is Andy Warhol describing himself, according to Lou Reed.</dd>
<dd>I think it's weird that you say you've never read any documentation of AW being gay, if you've read all these biographies. Because in every biography I read (and I have read quite a few) there's mention of it. There IS documentation - in these biographies - of AW being in love with certain men, sleeping with certain men, watching and producing gay porn (or gay art), etc. Several of his biographies and essays about him deal with his homosexuality in relation to his religion, more specific example: the fact that he used to sit in the back of the church because he there was a contradiction between his beliefs and his sexuality.</dd>
<dd>As said, he was also described as asexual and a voyeur, not participating in sex, but looking at it, and I've read at least 1 account of AW licking someone's shoes while masturbating, however true it may be. There are numerous sources.</dd>
<dd>The only thing about sex, that I remember right now as directly attributed to him, is the quote about "no sex being more exciting than sex", and a piece about the importance of laughing in the bedroom.</dd>
<dd>So, although this subject in his life is shrouded in some silence, as to WHOM he had relation(ship)s with, I think his sexuality was never unclear.</dd>

<p>- I hope I'm not stepping on any toes here, but Warhol was gay (when he was sexual at all) and I've changed the article to reflect that. There's the testimony of his friends (including the Lou Reed quote above) and in his diary he does write about his relationships with men. Admittedly he doesn't go into detail about having sex and it's possible these weren't sexual relationships, but they were clearly romantic. It's possible he was also bisexual, but he was definitely attracted to men. <a href="../../../m/u/l/User%7EMultiverse_eee2.html" title="User:Multiverse">Multiverse</a> 11:13, 27 June 2006 (UTC) Multiverse</p>

<p>I've never heard anything to suggest that Warhol was anything but asexual, given to strange perversions, yes, but no actual evidence that he was gay, straight, bi or otherwise. However, I do recognize the viewpoints given here so in an attempt to give both viewpoints to readers I edited the "Sexuality" section to reflect the contentiousness of the issue. Moments later Plumbago reverted to his original post. This PROVES that this is a contentious issue and should remain written as I have provided it. Either that or the value of Wikipedia in general falls into question as anyone with an axe to grind can make a change to any post to reflect his or her own viewpoint, preference, political stance, religious stance etc.</p>
<p>In fact, because of this whole issue the value of Wikipedia is greatly diminished to me. Despite the lack of ACTUAL TANGIBLE EVIDENCE people in this debate want to compartmentalize the man in an issue that is clearly unresolved. If you feel that there is no debate on the issue then provide actual evidence (and "a friend of mine" is hearsay and not actual evidence). rexthestrange.</p>
<p>Again my post has been reverted by the obviously narrowminded members of this community. For the record my post was as follows:</p>
<p><a name="Sexuality" id="Sexuality"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Talk%7EAndy_Warhol_032a.html" title="Edit section: Sexuality">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Sexuality</span></h3>
<p>This is a contentious issue. Some claim that Warhol was gay and that in <i>The Warhol Diaries</i> writes about his relationships with several men but this interpretation is somewhat ethereal. Early in his career he occasionally implied to the press that he had girlfriends, including a (possibly fictitious) girl he called "Taxi" who allegedly went for long periods without bathing. It is possible he was cagy about admitting his sexuality because he lived in an era when straight America was much less informed about homosexual culture, and gay men such as <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberace.html" title="Liberace">Liberace</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Lynde_c8a4.html" title="Paul Lynde">Paul Lynde</a> were generally accepted as simply being <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dandies.html" title="Dandies">dandies</a>. Gay themes in Warhol's work were often overlooked by a public oblivious to the symbolism of drag queens, cowboys and the other icons and cliches of gay culture that frequently appeared in his work, but this does not necessarily speak of his sexuality. On the occasions Warhol was publicly pressed about his sexuality, he was often playfully evasive. He often claimed to have little libido, and those who knew him have said that being hugged or otherwise touched made him quite uncomfortable. Because of this, another interpretation suggests that he was asexual, having no sexual identity at all, a view that is corroborated by frequenters of the Factory who observed that he appeared to have no active sex life and that his sexual encounters were limited to observation of others performing sexual acts.</p>
<hr />
<p>This is clearly a compromise on the issue that recognizes the contentiousness of the issue. However, certain members of this community are of the opinion that there is no contention (a bold statement considering that the very fact that we're having this argument proves it).</p>
<p>Congratulations to those people - you have proven that Wikipedia is completely worthless as a reliable source of information. This post must be retained to recognize that there alternate viewpoints on this issue. I will not repost my version. I'll leave it up to your consciences to do that. As requested I am putting this suggested post to the panel for concensus.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm sorry, but I disagree that the subject is contentious. This discussion does not make the subject contentious, if anything it has made your opinions contentious.</dd>
<dd>Besides asking for prove that you're wrong - which people have provided - you have not done much to support your claim, except to say that you've read books and written about Warhol, as have I and others contributing to this article.</dd>
<dd>For instance, why is Lou Reed's song not a valid source? Do you have a more valid source that proves Warhol was not gay?</dd>
<dd>Or is it that "homosexual" is not a good word to describe someone that is also considered not sexually active? Should it say "homophile and asexual"? Do you also contest that Warhol was a "homophile"?</dd>
<dd>I think it's a shame that you don't elaborate and leave your own discussion unfinished, because your written research and views on Warhol's amorous preferences could be interesting in understanding his work and the way it is perceived.</dd>
<dd>Perhaps you could add links to your writings in the links section, it would give people an opportunity to read your opposing view on his sexuality for themselves. In doing so you would be able to contextualize this article. I for one would like to read your work on Warhol. <a href="../../../s/m/q/User%7ESmqt_277b.html" title="User:Smqt">Slow Motion, Quick Thinking</a> 01:32, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Although I think Sharkesday's position is still not very precise, and although the general consensus on and off Wiki is that he was gay, still this view is not unheard of, and might be of interest to wiki readers, right? I hoped that a link to an external article might be a good compromise.</dd>
<dd>BTW, I think that the info on his sexuality was made into a separate, titled paragraph as a result of this discussion. I think it is kind of out-of-context to have a seperate section for it, if the general view is that he was gay. I intend to incorporate it in the general bio, and will think on a way to do so in a way that respects everybody's views. <a href="../../../s/m/q/User%7ESmqt_277b.html" title="User:Smqt">Slow Motion, Quick Thinking</a> 09:55, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I marked the whole section with a {{<a href="../../../s/o/u/Template%7ESources_a60f.html" title="Template:Sources">Sources</a>}} tag. The definite tone of the statement, along with numerous LGBT categories, ask for a much stronger backing (consensus among Warhol biographers rather than conjectures from authors of LGBT books) than I'm aware exists in the literature. I'll leave it up for a week before I remove it, but in general the paragraph should be rewritten. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 17:53, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hello. I think I was one of the first to make a contribution which acknowledged Warhol's sexuality. I am a published academic scholar, I am tenured, and have written on Warhol and on the sexual politics of Warhol studies. I may have started the sources page, and am happy to see more titles added to it. There is no controversy within art history over whether or not Warhol is gay. There is conversation about how this matters to how we interpret his work. People have different ideas about what Warhol's sex life might have looked like, but that he was interested in men, fell in love with men, and produced explicitly homoerotic work throughout his life is not up for debate within any of the scholarly circles I know - nor is it debated by those who participated in his circle (Viva, for example, who is still around, Mary Woronov, and see Callie Angell's extensive work on the films in her new book on the Factory films). Richard Dyer, a film scholar, once described Warhol as the "most famous gay man who ever lived." That some of the people who write about Warhol's sexuality do so from LGBT studies does not take away from the fact that Warhol was gay. This is, again, not a subject of interpretation. (Does my take on the matter become more valuable if I tell you that I am a woman? Does that make my perspective somehow more neutral? If a straight man wrote about Warhol's homosexuality - and plenty do - does that make their argument more accurate?) Some museums have downplayed and actively closeted Warhol's homosexuality, which no doubt aggravates popular misconceptions. I have yet to see a single reputable article or essay which asserts that Warhol was straight, and I've read nearly everything on Warhol published in major magazines, newspapers, and academic sources since 1960. Please see Gavin Butt's Between You and Me (Duke University Press, 2006) for a good explanation of how Warhol himself navigated homophobia during his lifetime - as a very effeminate gay man who never hid his sexuality, he encountered a lot of it. I have included this title in the references section. Warhol spoke to these experiences in Popism. The consequences of degaying Warhol are serious - It is important to represent popular attitudes, but they should also be signaled as wrong, innaccurate, and the effects of a homophobic culture.</p>
<p>To say that the question of whether or not Warhol was gay is "contentious" is, again, really really off base - only the most homophobic and/or ill informed would make this assertion. Even the most conservative of scholars in the field would never say Warhol wasn't gay - and they would not argue for the erasure of this fact from biographical record! Again, what is controversial is how much it matters in how we understand his art. Wikipedia editors should treat the erasure of information about how Warhol matters as a gay artist, information about the gay content of his work, and his own statements and ideas about sexuality as a form of hostile vandalism.</p>
<p>And so, I have reinstated a version of a paragraph I inserted about a year ago, with some references to scholarship on some points (I could have gone through the whole paragraph and put in references for, for example, scholarship on early exhibition of Warhol's films in gay porn theaters, and on the advertisements for Warhol's films in gay men's magazines - an essay by Thomas Waugh included Pop Out, which I co-edited in 1996 - but I thought this would be overkill). All scholarship I cite is referreed - meaning, reviewed by a panel of scholars and approved for publication by an academic outlet. I sign my name here, so you can track down my own writing on the artist if interested. Whatever anyone has felt about my work, or the work of others cited here who address sexuality, no one has ever faulted us for the integrity of our research. ~Jennifer Doyle December 11, 2006.</p>

This page seems to be subject to excessive tagging for "reliability", "balance" etc. when the topic is Warhol's sexuality. I think the section on this topic is now very well referenced/footnoted. Footnoting/references could be more consistent - throughout the whole entry on Warhol - but please, stop tagging the line that explains that he was one of the first artists to be open about his homosexuality. Explore the notes and links to external scholarly articles that are there before peppering sections with "source" requests. The whole section elaborates on this topic, and already directs readers to scholarly, well established sources. Oh, and published autobiographies by the artist ARE reliable sources for information about the artist. <a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJudyholliday_a86a.html" title="User:Judyholliday">Judyholliday</a> 17:11, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Science advances by speculation. When we know more about autism we might see very clearly that AW had the condition in some form. It is a way of seeing "the shape his creativity" more clearly - seeing what fits and doesn't fit the pattern one might expect with autism involves looking at the totality of his life and work more closely and more questioningly.

<p>It seems to me that the structure of the biography section is confusing - very haphazard. Do people have ideas about a cleaner way of organizing it? For me the sections on the 70s and 80s are a problem, as Warhol is profoundly identified with the 60s. And why a section on religious beliefs, but not, say, his early career as an advertisement illustrator, or for the sexuality paragraph. It seems like broader catagories are probably better than narrower ones for the biographical overview. Also, some contributors are writing text about his art in this section, but the next section (whose structure is also confusing) seems the better home for that stuff.</p>
<p>I am willing to try and take on some reorganizing (I can see something like: childhood, early career in advertisement, and then pop art etc. (with snappier headings like - "Success is a job in NY: Early Career"? &amp; "The Pope of Pop" for the rest?). This would simply reorganize content already there (I would file the paragraph about religious beliefs under the later section, for example; and I can see putting some of the stuff about his love for radio shows under childhood). These are just suggestions. I would love to hear what others think.

<dl>
<dd>I've had a go myself at reorganising. I've tried to make the biography flow, such that his art career comes first, delineated into decades as before, then followed by death, personal life and religious beliefs sections. It's still unwieldy, and I've removed a whole section (reproduced below) that appears out of place in biography (it's more art history). Someone else might manage to squeeze it into this section, but to me it belongs elsewhere (it's pretty interesting as it happens).</dd>

<dd>"Warhol used popular imagery and methods to visualize the American cultural identity of the 20th century.

This is perhaps best illustrated by one of his works: the Myths-series (also called the American Myths) - a series of silkscreened "portraits" of ten fictional characters taken from popular culture.

<dd>As a relatively "new" country the United States of America does not have one unified, classical system of myths (such as, for instance, the myths of ancient Greece). With his Myths-series, Andy Warhol proposed a system of mythical heroes and foes, and placed them at the basis of what he perceived to be an autonomous American cultural identity. These fictional characters are all signifiers for cultural values and human emotions that Warhol thought to be pivotal to a cultural sense of self. He provided America with the myths it thought it didn't have. The fact that almost all of these figures are symbols of commercial entities or enterpreneurial endeavors, speaks for the relationship that Warhol saw between the commercial and the cultural.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Like many of Warhol's works, the Myths have found their way back into culture through Warhol's oeuvre, acting as a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy. In a very literal way they were both an effect of popular American culture, and have gone on to affect it as well. Many of Warhol's images have been re-embedded into American culture as signifiers, after first having been taken from it by Warhol.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In the reading of his Myths-series, it is important to know that there is one character that does not originally have a visual representation. This is the last image in the series: The Shadow. The Shadow character was taken by Warhol from the radio-show "The Shadow", that Warhol has stated he used to listen to while being bound to his bed by St. Vitus' Dance. Warhol used a self-portrait of his clipped face throwing a demi-face shadow on the wall behind him, to represent The Shadow. In doing this, he has symbolically added himself to American culture, as an American myth."</dd>

<dd>I wrote the piece that was taken out in an attempt to add a bit of "art historical biography". Warhol's views, character and "tone of voice" can be very well illustrated by more in-depth explanations of some of his key works. I think the biography should be structured and chronological, but an article like this needs some art-history, because otherwise the article doesn't "show" why he is considered to be an influential artist. Plain facts don't cover it. Maybe it can become two articles? Life &amp; Works? How is this usually done? Would it be an idea to spawn a lot of sub-articles? Maybe some of his works could have their own? i.e. soupcans? Or would that become unmanageble? <a href="../../../s/m/q/User%7ESmqt_277b.html" title="User:Smqt">Slow Motion, Quick Thinking</a> 22:18, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Somebody has gone in and broken up the paragraphs under "sexuality" - I think dispursing those lines about homoerotics &amp; Warhol's work throughout other parts of the page. While I'm the first to support addressing the queer readings of his work, I'm not sure breaking up already written, edited, and revised paragraphs under "bio" and then sprinkling them throughout the "works" section is the best route. I think this whole entry needs major restructuring - but that sort of thing just confuses things even more - for example, opening the major section on his works with sentences about the homoerotics of his work isn't the best approach - as demonstrated by the above year long debate about sexuality, a solid, subtle, and comprhensive discussion of the sexuality issue under a heading "sexuality" is necessary. If you want to develop the writing in the entry about homoerotics in Warhol's works, ADD, rather than redistribute - and then we can all go through it and edit and flesh out.

<p>Looking over other artist entries - I would suggest something like the following structure: 1. Introduction (basic intro to who he was and why he was important - large issues in biography, such as his origins, his sexuality, his religious beliefs might be addressed here); 2. Life and Work (divided up at least into childhood and early career, warhol in the 1960s (an especially dense decade in terms of information), late career (here goes his work in video and television, his emergence as a celebrity - much stuff fromthe producer/product section). Existing writing about his paintings, his films, his relationship with Velvet Underground, with other artists would all be found here in section 2 - integrated loosely by decade, and the story of his development as an artist. (Nearly all his film-making, for example, was confined to the 60s, and should be part of that subsection.) This "Life and Work" would be the largest section. 3. Warhol's legacy - here we might address his influence, major representations of Warhol, media fascination with Warhol etc. 4. Lists (not sure what to call this - but here would be the complete list of his known films, the list of his books. This could be two sections, a filmography, and a bibliogrpahy - which ought to include major catalogues for exhibitions, no? 5. Notes, References, To Learn More (lists of documentaries and films, other books about the period, etc.) 7. External Links (right now there is some duplication - "see also" is basically a list of external links.

<p>I took out the text about IANAP since it's not really about Warhol, or his relation to IANAP. A quick Google search does not return IANAP in the context that was used here (in fact, the only mention of IANAP meaning "I Am Not A Profit Center" was on this AW wikipedia page...). It seems to be an ad or an intellectual form of vandalism. Most importantly I don't think it's a good paragraph for closing the text. Removed text below.<a href="../../../s/m/q/User%7ESmqt_277b.html" title="User:Smqt">Slow Motion, Quick Thinking</a> 23:23, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"As with any individual so impactful upon the world stage, Warhol inspired many counter-movements as well--specifically, artists who disdain the crass commercialism for which Warhol was arguably the most effective spokesperson then to date. Still actively working to undo the connection between art and commerce that Warhol (and later Warhol's followers, like Keith Haring and Kenny Scharf) so tirelessly advocated are a cadre of anti-commercial artists who have adopted the acronym "IANAP" or "I Am Not A Profit Center." IANAP's works were shown most recently at an outdoor group show across the street from the 2007 Warhol extravaganza. In contrast to the glitz and glamor of the Warhol event, IANAP's "gallery space" was simply a few yards of open sidewalk, lit with clip-lights, and festooned with gritty art composed mostly of found objects. Despite its low budget, IANAP's event drew a crowd that spilled into the street and blocked traffic for blocks."</dd>
