<p>ANDREW DOWNES</p>
<p>Andrew Downes was born in Handsworth, Birmingham, in 1950. He won a choral scholarship to St. John's College, Cambridge (in 1969), where he gained an MA degree specializing in composition; and in 1974 went on to study with Herbert Howells at the Royal College of Music. From 1992 to 2005 he was Head of the School of Composition and Creative Studies at Birmingham Conservatoire and was awarded a Professorship in 1992. Since 2005 he has worked as a freelance composer.</p>
<p><br />
Andrew Downes' music has been performed throughout the world, in many leading concert halls and cathedrals, and has been broadcast at home and abroad. His commissions have included: The Marshes of Glynn, for the Royal Opening of the Adrian Boult Hall in Birmingham in 1986; an Overture for the 1986 Three Choirs Festival; an Anthem for Shakespeare Sunday; Song Cycles for Tenor, John Mitchinson and for Mezzo-Soprano, Sarah Walker, both for performance on BBC Radio 3; works for 'Cantamus' Girls' Choir, and for the BBC Radio 4 Daily Service; Centenary Firedances, for the City of Birmingham's Centenary Festival of Fireworks and Music; Sonata for 8 Horns for the University of New Mexico; Fanfare for Madam Speaker, for the Installation of the Rt Hon Betty Boothroyd MP as Chancellor of the Open University; and many more.</p>
<p><br />
In January 1989 Andrew Downes visited Israel to attend a performance of his Sonata for Two Pianos by Bracha Eden and Alexander Tamir in the Israel Philharmonic Guest House. Eden and Tamir came to Birmingham in January 1990 to perform the work in a concert broadcast on BBC Radio 3.</p>
<p><br />
In November 1993 Downes conducted the Crane Concert Choir in the University of New York's Hosmer Hall in a performance of his St Luke Passion. In 1994 he attended, at the Calcutta School of Music, a performance of his Sonata for Violin &amp; Piano by Calcutta born violinist, John Mayer; and he revisited India in February 1996 for performances by 'Indo-Jazz Fusions' of his composition, Mela Kamavardhani, in Bombay, Calcutta and Delhi.</p>
<p><br />
New York Metropolitan Opera Soloist, Stephanie Blythe, performed Andrew's Songs for Spoon River at the Tanglewood Festival in August 1994. A series of recordings of Downes' works was broadcast on Central Peking Radio in 1994 and the China Film Philharmonic Orchestra requested copies of several of his orchestral works, while in Japan 'Cantamus Girls' Choir gave performances of Piano by Andrew Downes during their 1994 concert tour.</p>
<p>In March 1995 Andrew was invited by the University of New Mexico to give talks and to attend the performances of several of his works, and especially his Sonata for 8 Horns, commissioned by the University Horn Octet. In October and November 1995 he heard in Paris performances of his Sonata for Two Pianos by the 'Duo Scaramouche', including a performance on Radio 'France Musique'(see <a href="http://www.impulse-music.co.uk/scaramouche.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.impulse-music.co.uk/scaramouche.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.impulse-music.co.uk/scaramouche.htm</a> then click on "broadcasts and premieres") He was interviewed on Italian Television in March 1996 before a broadcast performance of his Sonata for Two Pianos by the 'Duo Scaramouche' from Barletta. (see <a href="http://www.impulse-music.co.uk/scaramouche.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.impulse-music.co.uk/scaramouche.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.impulse-music.co.uk/scaramouche.htm</a> then click on "broadcasts and premieres")</p>
<p><br />
In the Summer of 1996 he attended a performance of his Sonata for 8 Horns at the International Horn Convention in Oregon and the first performance of his Sonata for 8 Flutes at the National Flute Association's annual Convention in New York. This latter work has since been performed at numerous venues throughout the USA, Australia and Japan and also in Caracas by the National Flute Orchestra of Venezuela, as well as at a special Flute Day in Birmingham devoted to it, and twice at the Stratford International Flute Festival.</p>
<p><br />
Andrew Downes' Concert Overture, 'Towards a New Age', commissioned for the 150th anniversary of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, was premiered in Symphony Hall, Birmingham, on 28th January 1997 by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Andrew Constantine. Andrew was awarded a commemorative gold medal by the Institution in recognition of his outstanding contribution to their celebrations.</p>
<p><br />
In January 1998 Andrew made a trip to Vienna to hear his Sonata for 4 Horns performed by the Vienna Horn Society; and to Prague for a performance, in the Suk Hall of the 'Rudolfinum', of his Sonata for 8 Horns by the Horns of the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra. The Czech Philharmonic Horns played this Sonata again in Prague's Lichtenstein Palace in August 1998 and in the Suk Hall in December 2001; and they have recorded the work for Czech Radio and for CD. The CD, entitled Czech Philharmonic Horns (Classic Print label), was awarded 5 stars and voted CD of the month on <a href="http://www.musicweb.uk.net/classrev/2000/sept00/downes.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.musicweb.uk.net/classrev/2000/sept00/downes.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.musicweb.uk.net/classrev/2000/sept00/downes.htm</a> It has been broadcast on BBC Radio 3 in November 2000 and November 2001 and on Dutch Radio.</p>
<p><br />
The Choir of Trinity College, Cambridge performed Andrew's Anthem, The Souls of the Righteous in Trinity College Chapel in May 1999. In July 1999 members of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra joined guitarists Simon Dinnegan and Fred T. Baker to record Andrew's Concerto for Guitar, Bass Guitar and Strings for CD which was released in January 2001 on the Classic Print label. In November 1999 Andrew attended the first performance of his Sonata for Flute and Piano given by Carol Kniebusch Noe with Vicki Berneking in the American Cathedral in Paris. In 2000 he visited Virginia and Boston USA for concerts entirely devoted to his flute music by the James Madison University Flute Choir and the Massachusetts High School Flute Choir. Both of these Flute choirs have now made CDs of Andrew's flute music.</p>
<p><br />
Andrew's commissions for the Millennium include: an Oratorio, New Dawn, performed by soloists, choir and full symphony orchestra (including guitar ensemble) at Birmingham Conservatoire on 18th February 2000; Song of the Eagle for the James Madison University Flute Choir of Virginia USA, directed by Carol Kniebusch Noe, to celebrate their 25th anniversary and which they recorded in January 2000 for their CD devoted to Andrew's flute music; a special Evensong Service, performed at Royal Holloway (University of London) by the Chapel Choir conducted by Lionel Pike on St Cecilia's Day and recorded for CD in January 2001 by the choir (see: <a href="http://www.chapelchoir.co.uk/recordings.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.chapelchoir.co.uk/recordings.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.chapelchoir.co.uk/recordings.htm</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000666C1" class="external free" title="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000666C1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000666C1</a> as well as www.andrewdownes.com) and Sonata for 8 Pianists, premiered in the Adrian Boult Hall, Birmingham, on Wednesday 6th December at 7pm by pianists from France, Italy, and Britain.</p>

<p>Each of the factual statements, if they are to remain, need to be independently sourced (e.g. from an external website but not yours) - see <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">here</a>. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 02:40, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello.

<dd>As an admin you will know far more about sourcing than I do but if the editors want a good example of sourcing they could do worse than seeing <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gill_Langley_0fa6.html" title="Gill Langley">Gill Langley</a>. What needs to be done is strip the article down and rewrite it. A source is need for his Chair (link to college site), the long third para needs to be replaced by a weblink that lists all the commissions (his site is fine for that), then, say, three commissions should be highlighted. I should like to see sourcing for a typical radio or TV play, some evidence of the CDs, sources for the Czech Concerto and Songs of Autumn. If these are provided I should be happy to rewrite the article in a cleaner, crisper fashion. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 01:11, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay, I have trawled through Factiva and found as many newspaper references as possible. I have also done as many wikilinks as I can. Consequently, I have removed the sourcing and wikilinking tags from the top of the article. If there are any specific factual statements that still need verification through citations, please add {{fact}} after the statement (this will add a "citation needed" link). - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_d9f5.html" title="User:Mark">Mark</a> 05:19, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
