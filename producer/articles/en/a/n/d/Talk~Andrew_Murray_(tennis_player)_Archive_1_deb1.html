<h2><span class="mw-headline">Random</span></h2>
<p>Has someone got bored with updating this page? You can't list individual tournament performances up to San Jose and then have nothing after, you either have more detail consistantly or less detail and just outline periods of time. He has played countless tournaments since San Jose including the Davis Cup and several Masters series events. There are tournaments listed like Auckland where he wasnt setting the world alight, if you want those listed then you have to list the other ones where he does little as well.</p>
<p>Ok I have updated the 2006 record to this week, I suggest this can be condensed once the clay court season is finished. Maybe it can be arranged into US hardcourt spring and clay court sections.</p>
<hr />
<p>OMG, he was in the Dunblane massacre! That's awful! Today though his match against Stepanek was absolutely brilliant, I hope he does well!</p>
<p><a name="Wimbledon_Wildcard" id="Wimbledon_Wildcard"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Wimbledon Wildcard</span></h2>
<p>I am not going to remove this as I know nothing about tennis, however this sentence makes little sense to me:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Murray's strong play and the excitement created by it helped push his way into a wild card for <a href="../../../w/i/m/Wimbledon_Championships_126c.html" title="Wimbledon Championships">Wimbledon</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I would have thought that he was given a wildcard because of his success in several junior tournaments, especially last year's US Open, rather than the fact that he is exciting. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERje_9381.html" title="User:Rje">Rje</a> 00:41, Jun 24, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree that the statement (which i put in) is ambigious and slightly wrong-sounding. But, as Wimbledon's wildcards are given out by the <a href="../../../l/t/a/LTA_d4c8.html" title="LTA">LTA</a>, i.e. British Tennis Officials, i think they would try and appease the public to an extent by allowing the wild cards to go against the rankings.</p>
<p>For example, they let old-favourite with London's Aussie community <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Phillipoussis_d2a2.html" title="Mark Phillipoussis">Mark Phillipoussis</a>, world rank 142, (wimbledon having 128 players in the main draw) in, when there were less 'glamorous' or well-known players ranked higher than him in the world, who were arguably more worthy of the wild card, having gone to more tournaments, and worked harder to have accumulated more ranking points.</p>
<p>Equally, they let <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Krajicek_da31.html" title="Richard Krajicek">Richard Krajicek</a> and his sister into the mixed doubles. there are a number of reasons why, had krajcek not been an ex-champion, he wouldn't have been allowed in:</p>
<ul>
<li>He hadn't played a single senior-level match that year, and was effectively retired.</li>
<li>He hadn't won a tournament since 2000, and hadn't won a doubles tournament for a whole decade, since 1995!</li>
<li>His highest ever ranking for doubles was 45, which even then would have barely seen him sneak into the 48-team mixed-doubles event.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, in other words, yes I do think that the LTA play up to the public - the whole point about wildcards is to allow ex-greats or upcoming youngsters in (even youngsters with better junior rankings were not give cards). I will make the sense more clear.</p>

<p>The article says that he sustained an injury - I thought that it was more due to tiredness. Any ideas?</p>
<p>Well,</p>
<ul>
<li>During Johansson @ Queen's, he twisted his ankle as a result of cramp - so essentially his tiredness caused his injury.</li>
<li>Against Nalbandian in SW19, he was tired, but hadn't aggravated any injury - although his ankle was still hurting.</li>

<dt><i>Number 1</i></dt>
<dd>I have tried to compromise the UK/Scotland debate. I have put "Country - Great Britain (Davis Cup), UK (Nationality)" in the infobox - scotland is a nation not a country, and the purpose of this is to demonstrate his davis cup team and nationality. this detail appears on tables of other top tennis players. I have then made it clear that he is a UK Citizen in the introduction, but also a proud scotsman. Oh, and by the way, i own a kilt.</dd>
<dt><i>Number 2</i></dt>
<dd>Will we eventually have to move the extensive details on his 2005 season to something like Andrew Murray's breakthrough year, or just delete it?</dd>
<dt><i>Number 3</i></dt>
<dd>Does anyone have a quote confirming that he prefers clay courts?</dd>

<dd>In response to Number 1, he should be listed as representing Great Britain and his nationality as being from the UK, since neither England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland are official nationalities, as they are not independant nations. So I agree with you there. And for number 2, I think we should just maybe leave it for now and wait, it obviously will have to shorten eventually, but I think we should let 2005 end first.

<dd>Oh goodness, I just read what it said! I think I will edit it, as it kinda gives an impression that it is abnormal for a Scot to be a UK citizen. Since every Scot is a UK citizen, it doesn't need to be mentioned and it doesn't need to mention that he has a UK passport.

<p>It is standard practice on Wikipedia to refer to people as English, Scottish, Welsh in biographical articles. Why the fuss over Murray? I haven't seen this kind of fuss over Scottish?British, English?British, Welsh?British for over two months, and it is largely biogrphical articles I have been reading. It seems very strange that as soon as someone is in the news they immediately get changed from English to British, etc. Why? I bet you that if Murray was No 465, or deceased (God forbid) then he would happily be left to be a Scot! (By the way: Scotland (or England, or Wales) is a nation and a country, but not a <b>state</b>. Subtle, but vital difference. It crops up every day on Wikipedia on one article or another.)--<a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a> 09:59, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Well,</p>
<ul>
<li>Clearly we wouldn't be having this discussion if we knew that.</li>
<li>By the way, I consider Alan Mackin, a hapless Scottish tennis player, to be British, and I equally consider Fred Perry to be a British - he is. There's no need to get bitter just 'cos you've got a crap football team.</li>
<li>Finally, Scotland is not a country, according to both me and the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> page, it is <i>"a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constituent_country.html" title="Constituent country">constituent country</a> of the United Kingdom"</i>.

If we take Tim Henman as a guide on this matter, I notice he is described as an English tennis player on this site.</p>
<p>Another point of note relates to the bad old days of football hooliganism. When English football clubs such as Liverpool did well in Europe, they were referred to as English. However, when their supporters (or hooligans claiming to be supporters) went on the rampage, they were referred to as British hooligans.</p>
<p>A final point should sum up how we deal with Andy's nationality. He is British and no-one, including himself, complains about this. However, he detests being called English just as much as Canadians detest being called Americans (despite Canada being part of the continent of America; this is something I don't understand). So as long as no-one calls him English, I don't think we should have too much to worry about&#160;;) <a href="../../../m/k/n/User%7EMkns_41e0.html" title="User:Mkns">Mkns</a> 19:57, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry, but I find it ridiculous that he should be removed from the category of British tennis players. Yes, he's a Scottish tennis player, and yes he should be in that category, but he is also therefore British, and it is only sense to include him in that! If we are having our tennis players kept in seperate categories, then how on earth does the British category even exist? Why not all split them up into Welsh and English and Northern Irish etc.</dd>

<dd>Hi Jamandell - check out the "Categories" thread lower down this page. We reached a sort of consensus a few months back to keep him in the "British" category. I'm keen to keep Andy in the category, because it confused me when he wasn't there when I was looking there to find this article. However, there are good arguments for sticking with a hierarchy of categories... As for his nationality in the first paragraph - "Scottish" works well for me - Those readers who might be confused by the difference between Scottish &amp; British can click on the word "Scottish" to find out more (this is an encyclopedia!), and I very much doubt anyone would be trying to find the article by coming from a list of Scots (which would be so long as to be unusable for that purpose).</dd>

<p>is this a private thing between Mkns and anonymous? or can anyone join in?</p>

<dd>Starting to anger me actually, I don't know whether to join in or not. I'm not sure what the official policy is on fansites and the like, and I'm not particularly interested in looking it up, but we have other fansites listed which don't get removed. So it seems to me like some personal vendetta, perhaps by a rival website builder? The user needs warning that it's considered vandalism, as far as I'm aware s/he hasn't yet; and failing that, banning. <a href="../../../m/_/a/User%7EM_A_Mason_df15.html" title="User:M A Mason">M A Mason</a> 00:10, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>When I started putting the link back in I made it clear in my comment that it had been removed for no good reason. I have no idea who runs the site in question but as you say, other fan sites are linked to from the Wiki page so I don't understand why the anonymous user is repeatedly removing it. How do you consider advising someone that it is vandalism? Isn't the comment I left the first 2 times clear enough? And why is no-one else putting the link back in; up to this point others seem quite happy to stand by and let the page be vandalised! <a href="../../../m/k/n/User%7EMkns_41e0.html" title="User:Mkns">Mkns</a> 22:00, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Suggested way forward</span></h3>
<p>I'm really getting tired of the murraysworld.com/andymurraytennis.com game. Can I suggest a solution: Why don't the two of you agree to share the top billing evenly. Let's have murraysworld at the top of the list for one week, then andymurraytennis at the top for another week. I suggest that you also link to each other (which will improve both your Google search results), and try to get links from the official site, if necessary with the same sharing of ranking as on here.</p>
<p>It's a real shame that you're wasting energy on this, when I'm sure that you're key contributors to this page and many other tennis- related wiki pages, beyond being responsible for two very impressive fan sites.</p>
<p>Please would you both also (in good Wikipedia tradition) provide an external source for the claims that Murray and/or his team reads the sites. I've removed the claims for now until you can do so. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobbieC_c28b.html" title="User:RobbieC">RobbieC</a> 07:38, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Regarding the battle over first place: Is it not fair to give first place to the link that was submitted to Wikipedia first? MurraysWorld was posted on Wikipedia a long time before andymurraytennis.com so it only seems fair.</p>
<p>And about the 'As read by' claims: Andy's current management told MurraysWorld that he reads the website. The short Q&amp;A can be found here: <a href="http://www.murraysworld.com/messageboard/index.php/topic,1927.0.html" class="external free" title="http://www.murraysworld.com/messageboard/index.php/topic,1927.0.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.murraysworld.com/messageboard/index.php/topic,1927.0.html</a></p>
<p>This Q&amp;A was provided via email direct from his manager, I can supply the email with the header information if you can provide me with a way to privately send it to you.</p>
<p>Andy's previous management personally told me in a meeting that he reads the site. You can find the discussion here: <a href="http://www.murraysworld.com/messageboard/index.php/topic,340.0.html" class="external free" title="http://www.murraysworld.com/messageboard/index.php/topic,340.0.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.murraysworld.com/messageboard/index.php/topic,340.0.html</a></p>

<dd>As for the battle over first place, what I think we need is a solution that both you and the phantom andymurraytennis.org person can both live with, so that you don't have to spend all your time on changing the links on this page and getting upset with each other. I'm not sure that saying "I was here first" will have that effect. Meanwhile please remember that <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_mirror_or_a_repository_of_links.2C_images.2C_or_media_files" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a repository of links</a> and (in my opinion at least)that we're here to provide a useful reference work for people trying to find out about Andy and not to provide traffic to any of the (excellent) fan websites. See if you can think of a way of co- existing with andymurraytennis.org so that we can all concentrate on how to improve this page!</dd>

<p>I don't know if this "battle" will ever end unless a moderator of Wikipedia doesn't put an end to it. Personally I think it would be unfair to share the position with the other party as MW.com was at the top for a long time until they discovered Wikipedia and decided to come along and knock it off.

<dd>I can see it's really annoyed you - must be really frustrating when you've put so much effort into your site and, as you say, got MW to the top of the wikipedia list first. Unfortunately, my guess is that if you did take the issue to arbitration, the solution would be to take all fan site links off the page. To avoid having to go that far, we should try to reach a consensus among the wikipedians who edit this page. Ideally, by getting you and whoever it is to agree on it - and as you say, I can't see that happening if you both want to be top, and won't compromise. I've left messages on the talk page for the andymurraytennis.org ip address person, as well as on the messageboard affiliated to that site, so we'll hopefully get them to come here and discuss it. Interestingly, the link to andymurraytennis.org got removed last night when the messageboard link was brought to the top of the list by the same person who vandalised your site's reference.</dd>

<p>Reply: I've changed it because I think that andymurraytennis.org and it's activeboard messageboard are by far and away the best Murray and British tennis sites on the web. I think that it's in the best interest of wiki readers to be directed to the best site on the web for Murray news. If you look at murraysworld, the majority of the discussion is non-tennis and just seems to be schoolfriends chatting like on msn. Surely, the best "tennis site" for murray news should be at the top of the list.</p>
<p>&gt; This was posted on the talk page of the ip address of the person who is moving the murraysworld.org link to the bottom of the list.

<dd>Moving MurraysWorld.com to the bottom of the list and putting his website to the no1 spot is vandalism in my eyes, no need for that. And regarding his reply, that is simply his opinion and considering his website is more focused on British tennis in general (he has said this is the case on several occasions) rather than just Andy Murray - I feel MW is a much more relevant and useful resource.

<dd>Yes I suppose there should be a list of fansites, I don't see a reason why now. And I've always thought that alphabetical order would be best, it's completely without bias. I also think that none of these sites should have a caption beside them, eg "As read by Andy Murray". Wikipedia shouldn't be used as advertising space. A person will find it out for themselves if they choose to visit the site in the first place.

<dd>Hmm - to Q1, I agree with Wangi. Technically they are not allowed on Wikipedia. However, having been part of an informal editting group on the <a href="../../../e/l/t/Elton_John_16de.html" title="Elton John">Elton John</a> article, I would add that it's virtually impossible to stop them without locking the page. We also have the problem of gay-haters (as a straight bloke, I find some of the comments extremely stupid - it's really been an education), so getting the fans on our side in the bigger vandal threat is useful. Some of the fan sites also run large gatherings of fans - so excluding them excludes both verified/useful information and some good editors/contributors. For instance, we have a fansite listed from Brazil (which is written in Portugese), who have added much - plus they run an annual gathering which is the biggest in Soth America. In the end, if you accept the idea of limited inclusion of fansites (we have an area in the "External links" headed "Fansites"), then I suggest you look at a set of validity criteria for including them first rather than thinking how to order them. You can't list anyone's MySpace or Yahoo! site/picture book listings etc, or something which obviously is just looking to cash-in on Murray-mania. But think what sites a real fan looking for other information on Murray would like? For instance, we have a section on lyrics and music chords - what about sites listing match statistics, which we could never do full justice to on Wiki?

<dd>It all gets back to the fact that Wikipedia isn't a link directory.

Wikipedia has a series of policies and guidelines, one of those is <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> which deals with external linking.

<p><a name="Trying_to_pull_the_discussion_together" id="Trying_to_pull_the_discussion_together"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Trying to pull the discussion together</span></h3>
<p>OK, the discussion's been going on for five days now, and before it runs the risk of going where a lot of these discussions go, and degenerating into an edit war, I thought I'd try to pull the strands of the discussion together.</p>
<p><b>WP:EL</b> Wangi has drawn our attention to the Wikipedia policy on external links <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> and how they might apply to fansites. I think we're all agreed that the big long list that we had before isn't appropriate to an Encyclopedia. On a developing page like Andy Murray's page, it's arguable that it was doing no harm, but once an edit war started there, it had to go.</p>
<p>From my reading of WP:EL, and from the discussion above, links to fansites are appropriate either if they are felt to be informative by the editors, or if the subject is the sort that will generate many fansites, and to give readers an example of one.</p>
<p>Trident makes another excellent point, which is not in WP:EL, but probably should be, which is that the editing community will gain from including fansites, because we'll pull in contributors from those sites, and avoid excluding editors committed to the subject, with access to good information.</p>
<p>So we should have only a few (if any) links.</p>
<p><b>How many links</b></p>
<p>Wangi, Mais Oui and Mkns have (I think) come down in favour of having no links whatsoever (As Mais Oui says: "Scorched Earth"!)</p>
<p>There are a good many others who see the point in having links (although I'm not sure how many links) Jamandell, Vonce, Trident13, Andycjp, Mark7144.</p>
<p>So how many links before we become a "link directory"? - I doubt if we should have more than 3 or 4.</p>
<p><b>Useful/Informative links</b> The next question is then about whether the Andy Murray fansites that were on the list are useful or informative.</p>
<p>Trident suggests we look at what kind of information a good fansite could provide that we couldn't or shouldn't on Wikipedia, and judge whether to include specific sites on those bases. I'd suggest that some of the things a good tennis player fansite could provide would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>inside information, not available on other news sources (possibly what other news sources would see as trivial)</li>
<li>collation of information which can only otherwise be obtained by trawling large numbers of sites</li>
<li>a strong community of other fans</li>
<li>detailed reports of matches (or indeed commentaries)</li>
</ul>
<p>On that basis, I'd say two of the sites on that list fit the bill to my knowledge.</p>
<p>One is run by our friend Mark7144, who's not exactly helping his cause by getting blocked for Vandalism today.</p>
<p>However, he does run a genuinely good fansite, Murraysworld, with a large, strong community of fans, and which collates news stories about Murray incredibly well. It also has occasional exclusives, such as interviews with Andy or his team. As you can see from his contributions to this discussion, Mark's passionate about his subject and his site, so hopefully he'll be a strong contributor here as well!</p>
<p>The other is the "Andy Murray Message Board", which has another strong community of fans (including Vonce &amp; myself from this page). The messageboard participants jointly provide a wealth of information that a website or blog couldn't, including live and archived web commentary on matches. Rankings calculations and collation of information on things such as his schedule, which are usually more up to date than his own site!</p>
<p><b>How to order the list</b></p>
<p>The only proposals here are alphabetical order, although I'm not sure that we should be ordering "fairly" rather than with some editorial judgement on what order is most appropriate.</p>
<p><b>Advertising</b> (e.g. "As read by Andy Murray", "with news &amp; commentary")</p>
<p>Again, I think we're all agreed that advertising isn't appropriate for an encyclopedia. However, I'd suggest that a descriptive NPV comment next to a link would be useful to the reader. Maybe we should ask editors without conections to the sites to suggest such a comment?</p>
<p><b>Proposed way forward</b></p>
<p>We go ahead with a list of just two fansites, Murraysworld and the "Andy Murray Message Board", in that order, mainly because Murraysworld is a more traditional fansite than the message board, and so more what a reader might be looking for.</p>
<p>If the editors that included the other fansites can make a reasonable case for inclusion, then we should also consider them. The last time I checked them out, though, most had not been updated for quite some time, or were what Trident calls "MySpace or Yahoo! site/picture book listings etc,", and so I don't think this risks recreating a super- long list. In the meantime, if more links are added, or the order changed, we should delete them, direct them to this discussion on the talk page, and block the authors if they persist without making a strong case and gaining consensus.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Consensus?</b></p>
<p>Is this at least a way forward that we can all live with? - maybe not as tidy as Wangi &amp; Mais Oui would want, but taking us away from the long list, and especially the edit war, while keeping the fansite links that many want to see remain.</p>

<dd>After checking your new link, I suggest removing the ones hosted in LiveJournal and Activeboard on sight (per <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html#Links_normally_to_be_avoided" title="WP:EL">9th guideline</a>. mountmurray at freewebs has only 310 hits, Wikipedia won't advertise their site. britainsnewhope has 377, same thought. The one hosted at TennisCrazy states that <i>THIS SITE WILL NOT BE UPDATED INBETWEEN JULY AND SEPTEMBER BECAUSE I WON'T BE IN THE COUNTRY, SORRY.</i> We won't be advertising them for free during three months. Even if that note weren't there, it has less than 1700 hits, not notable enough to be included in Wikipedia. That leaves one fan site, which seems to be the only one that (apparently) can be considered good enough for inclusion. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 22:52, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is the sort of reasoning I'd expect from folk advocating having links, rather than just "i think it'd be good"! Based on this thorough work through the issue I'd have real problems with more than 1 link, and i'd still prefer the simple solution of simply having just the official site.

<dd>Thanks Wangi - that's again really useful - Alexa rank is not a bad objective way to go forward, and Raybrujo's research and argument makes the case for losing all except Murraysworld. I still think there's a good argument for including the activeboard site (and not removing it on sight!), as I'd suggest it's the exception that proves the rule when it comes to forums <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html#Links_normally_to_be_avoided" title="WP:EL">9th guideline</a>. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobbieC_c28b.html" title="User:RobbieC">RobbieC</a></dd>

<dd>Thanks RobbieC for going to the effort of typing that well thought out argument for the inclusion of fansites. I agree many of them should not be listed purely based on lack of activity. I've re-added the MurraysWorld link because I do think it is useful considering the official site doesn't even offer a message board.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Although someone has in the past been vandelising the link section by placing the activeboard site to the top whilst moving others to the bottom - I do think it should be considered to remain on the fansite list. It has been around for a long time covering Andy's progress and so it would seem a little harsh not allowing it to stay. Mark7144 12:28, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understand your suggestion but I actually think it should of been the other way around.

<dl>
<dd>Thanks for putting the attribution up there Wangi - apologies for not signing my original post.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I must say my heart sank when I saw your post - I'd hoped we'd reached some sort of compromise, and could go forward with some of the more important things that need doing on this page, and avoid spending much longer on this issue.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I apologise. I'd read your previous comment: " I'd have real problems with more than 1 link, and i'd still prefer the simple solution of simply having just the official site." as meaning you weren't over the moon with the compromise I suggested, but would go along with it if no- one else objected, with maybe further discussions required re the Activeboard site.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In fact, with the lack of response since I proposed the compromise, I'm guessing that apart from you me and Mark, the rest of the editors are thoroughly bored with the question.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As per my original summing up of the issue, I made it a majority (6 to 3)in favour of having some fansite listings: "Wangi, Mais Oui and Mkns have (I think) come down in favour of having no links whatsoever (As Mais Oui says: "Scorched Earth"!)There are a good many others who see the point in having links (although I'm not sure how many links) Jamandell, Vonce, Trident13, Andycjp, Mark7144."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Can you suggest an alternative compromise position, as I think we're stuck otherwise?</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I don't know where wangi is getting his figures from but RobbieC there is no reason to get "stuck" - you put forward your proposal and the majority are in favour. It's really that simple. Wangi had ample opportunity to appose your proposal but has left it inconventiantly late but his opinion on that matter holds little weight with him being the only opposition to the vote. No new proposal is needed - if you intend to try and persuade wangi to change his opinion on this matter, I doubt it will happen hence why we had this vote.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This issue is now closed whether wangi or a couple of others users like it or not. It has been dealt with sensibly and I would very much appreciate it if someone would put back the valuable links that aid the users in finding their information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Thank you for putting your free time in helping to resolve this issue RobbieC. We had a vote, the majority wins and of course some people won't be happy but that's democracy. Mark7144 02:27, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks Mark. Let's give Wangi the rest of the day to come back before re-instating any links.<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobbieC_c28b.html" title="User:RobbieC">RobbieC</a> 07:03, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>Must say I'm confused - where is all the support for Robbie's proposal? I see only a response by myself and Mark - and that wasn't to the section inviting "votes". Mark, you're claiming there's consensus (for something, I'm not sure what going by your last paragraph) but the text above simply doesn't support that.</dd>
<dd>Out of all the various options discussed above the one with the most clear support is the simple official link only - i'm not saying there's consensus behind it, but you cannot count simple "me too" responses (with no reasoning) in favour of some form of links at the begining of this discussion as being support for the latest proposal. And with regards to time - well we've all got more important things in our lifes, and timed votes really aren't the "wikiway" to sort things out, because remember <a href="../../../i/s/n/WP%7EISNOT_f5c2.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_experiment_in_democracy" title="WP:ISNOT">Wikipedia's <i>not</i> a democracy</a>&#160;;)</dd>
<dd>I'd agree with Robbie - most folk simply couldn't care anymore. That's what "no howls of protest", nor support point to.</dd>
<dd>I'll go with the reasoning above by ReyBrujo as a compromise - the following links:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.andymurray.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.andymurray.com/" rel="nofollow">Andy Murray - official site</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.murraysworld.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.murraysworld.com/" rel="nofollow">Murray's World - fan site</a></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>How's that look? Thanks/<a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWangi_79ab.html" title="User:Wangi">wangi</a> 08:09, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That looks like a great start. We can get the links up, and move on. I'm disappointed to lose the link to the activeboad site - wikipedia is how I found that site in the first place, and it's my main source of info &amp; discussion re Andy. However, I think we'd need a "stage 2" discussion to get it in there, and I don't think we should not have links in the meantime.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So going forward, I guess:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>we put those links up</li>
<li>we revert any additions to the list unless the editor can provide a good reason for adding them and get a consensus for doing so, pointing to this discussion to justify our actions, and treating new linkers as vandals.</li>
<li>I try to pull together enough people to support bringing back the messageboard as I can.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>- Wangi, do have a look at the activeboard site - particularly the "Andy's schedule", the "Andy's ranking" and the "other british men" sections - see if you agree that it is a useful resource. <a href="http://www.activeboard.com/forum.spark?forumID=61841&amp;p=1" class="external text" title="http://www.activeboard.com/forum.spark?forumID=61841&amp;p=1" rel="nofollow">/Andy Murray message board</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think you're being fair to the initial responses - especially Trident's, which I thought was very well reasoned.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dd>Not got time to go into any more detail just now, but... don't bite the folk who add links too hard - assume good faith&#160;;) It's useful to add {{<a href="../../../w/e/l/Template%7EWelcomeip_7d8c.html" title="Template:Welcomeip">welcomeip</a>}} (or {{<a href="../../../w/e/l/Template%7EWelcome_2ac1.html" title="Template:Welcome">welcome</a>}}) if it's not already there along with {{<a href="../../../s/p/a/Template%7ESpam_0bb2.html" title="Template:Spam">spam</a>}} to their talk page - points them to the direction of the guidelines.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Great to see some progress being made. On wangi's comment - I personally think the "me too" responses are absolutely valid considering most of them if not all may simply agree with previous comments so no need to unnecessarly repeat ourselves.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My thoughts on the ActiveBoard site are that it should be considered - it has been around for a long time and can at times offer a more serious anaylsis on a match. However I will not offer too much into the ActiveBoard inclusion discussion as I'm not a user there so I have reduced interest. Mark7144 22:16, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">2006 progress</span></h2>
<p>Is there any standard way that information about Andy's progress in 2006 should be added? I think if there was a consensus as to how the information is added, it would save the page growing to ridiculous lengths.

<p>Maybe we should put any knowledge which is specific to a particular tournament from 2005 into that tournaments page, reducing the 2005 entry to maybe only three paragraphs, but we can let 2006 run to a 'ridiculous length', as long as all the info is put somewhere at the end of the year. i might start doing some of that later today.</p>

When I check the page for another Spanish-resident tennis player (<a href="../../../r/a/f/Rafael_Nadal_a564.html" title="Rafael Nadal">Rafael Nadal</a>), it lists his town and Spain, not the autonomous community that he lives.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Categories</span></h2>
<p>Will I start a flame war by proposing that Andy be added to the "British Tennis Players" category, as well as the "Scottish Tennis Players" category. It is confusing for a tennis fan to see less successful players such as Alex Bogdanovic on that page, while having to click on the link to Scottish players for Andy (&amp; Elena Baltacha). Haven't made the change after seeing all the fuss over his nationality. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobbieC_c28b.html" title="User:RobbieC">RobbieC</a> 13:50, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Re- instated this. Dimadick makes a reasonable argument for not including Murray in both "British Tennis Players" and it's sub- category "Scottish Tennis Players", however as discussed above this leads the casual searcher to a page where she can find Henman, Rusedski, Fred Perry, Virginia Wade, Sue Barker but no Andy Murray or Elena Baltacha, which is just confusing.<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobbieC_c28b.html" title="User:RobbieC">RobbieC</a> 19:55, 3 April 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">A trial with Rangers?</span></h2>
<p>I personally know Andy Murray as we were in the same tennis squad as juniors. I can assure that he never had a football trial with Rangers FC. I have played football with him on many occasions, we killed time between matches at tournaments this way and he wasn't good enough to have a trial with them&#160;:)</p>
<p>Someone's added in that Murray had a trial with Rangers. I think this is extremely unlikely. Unless anyone can prove this, I think it should be removed.</p>

<dl>
<dd>No, sorry, that proves that the statement on Murray's page is wrong. The quote from that site states "Grew up playing soccer and tennis and once was offered to play with Glasgow Rangers..." which is entirely different to "had a trial with Rangers F.C.". I'd still dispute that he ever was "offered to play with Rangers" - maybe someone should ask either Murray, or Rangers themselves.
<dl>
<dd>Why don't you just amend the wording in the article? The page I linked certainly seems to confirm there was some sort of contact between Murray and R.F.C. as does <a href="http://www.lta.org.uk/ReachTheTop/Players/Men/MurrayAndrew.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.lta.org.uk/ReachTheTop/Players/Men/MurrayAndrew.htm" rel="nofollow">The LTA</a>. Given I linked the official ATP Tour website, I think that's two pretty credible sources. Why would you dispute that he ever was "offered to play with Rangers", just 'cos? Do you have a reason?<a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHellinterface_076a.html" title="User:Hellinterface">Hellinterface</a> 12:39, 1 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>First off, calm down dude, it's perfectly OK for people to have different opinions on something. This talk page is here to talk about stuff like this. Now, the reason I find it debateable is because there has never been a suggestion before that he has played football seriously at any level. I therefore consider that the data appearing in those websites you link to might not be particularly reliable. The suggestion I gave of figuring out whether this data is correct is still valid. And I didn't "amend the wording in the article" because I would consider that rude - you wrote it, so I figure you might want to change it if you agree that it does indeed need changing. Anyone have contacts with either Murray or Rangers? I have a greater chance of getting info out of Rangers, but I suspect if someone knows Murray, that would be even better. Or should we keep this statement in his page simply because a couple of websites have mentioned it?
<dl>
<dd>Firstly, I didn't write it. Secondly, why would two seperate professional bodies of tennis make it up? I'm not getting worked up, but to claim "I'd still dispute that he ever was offered to play with Rangers" without backing it up with some justification seems rather obtuse, especially when the site I linked was the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals_b4bb.html" title="Association of Tennis Professionals">Association of Tennis Professionals</a>, followed with <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawn_Tennis_Association_2bc0.html" title="Lawn Tennis Association">Lawn Tennis Association</a>. Puzzling. To Quote "there has never been a suggestion before that he has played football seriously at any level. I therefore consider that the data appearing in those websites you link to might not be particularly reliable." Essentially what you're saying is "I didn't know about it, so it unlikely to be true". Does Murray normally run everything by you? It's only trivia, I don't care whether it stays or goes... <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHellinterface_076a.html" title="User:Hellinterface">Hellinterface</a> 23:31, 1 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Confirmation from someone who actually knows he didn't get a trial with Rangers, then (at the top of this thread, for some reason; I'll leave it there). Time to remove the erroneous information. I'll not bother asking Rangers themselves, then.</dd>

<p>The strategy of giving POV detailed info on each and every tournament Andy plays, will backfire very soon. He is young, and likely to be around for some time.

Hi HJensen - I'm sure you're right. I think the 2005 tournaments have already been greatly tidied up, and I'm sure the 2006 ones will be as well as the page gets longer and more unwieldy. However, this is an iterative process, and we'll find that the more recent matches will get added pretty much as they happen, and then the more difficult summarising process will begin once there's some perspective (and some editorial time) to play with.<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobbieC_c28b.html" title="User:RobbieC">RobbieC</a> 21:10, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

Maybe you could make a page called Andrew Murray's Career Results or somthing. and just have Semi- Final , Final and tournements hes won on the Main page. but also the Semi- Final , Final and tournements hes won on the Results page. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobo6balde66_fb42.html" title="User:Bobo6balde66">Bobo6balde66</a> 16:56, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
