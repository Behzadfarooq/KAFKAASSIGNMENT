<p>Sathya Narayana was born into a poor <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agrarian.html" title="Agrarian">agrarian</a> family in the remote village of <a href="../../../p/u/t/Puttaparthi.html" title="Puttaparthi">Puttaparthi</a>, located in <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anantapur.html" title="Anantapur">Anantapur district</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andhra_Pradesh_0379.html" title="Andhra Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a>, India, as the son of Pedda Venkappa Raju and mother Eshwar Amma. According to professor Narayana Kasturi in his book <i>Easwaramma</i>, who also wrote Sathya Sai Baba's authorized biography, Sathya was born and conceived through a <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgin_birth.html" title="Virgin birth">Virgin birth</a>. After recovering from an unexplained illness in his teens the young Sathya claimed to be the <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reincarnation.html" title="Reincarnation">reincarnation</a> of the <a href="../../../f/a/k/Fakir.html" title="Fakir">Fakir</a> <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shirdi_Sai_Baba_a85f.html" title="Shirdi Sai Baba">Shirdi Sai Baba</a> in the <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940s.html" title="1940s">1940s</a>. According to his own assertion and the biography by Kasturi (which the British journalist Mick Brown of the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Telegraph_5b8d.html" title="The Telegraph">The Telegraph</a> called a <a href="../../../h/a/g/Hagiography.html" title="Hagiography">hagiography</a>), he stopped going to school in the town of Uravakonda on October 20, 1940 to start his mission. However, he is listed in the 1942 school record of the nearby village Bukkapatnam. Though the exact year on which he started his mission full-time is uncertain, it is a fact that in the <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940s.html" title="1940s">1940s</a> he took the fakir's name. Kasturi's biography/hagiography mentions several miracles by and signs of divinity of the young Sathya. According to Howard Murphet, in his book <i>Sai Baba Man of Miracles</i> (see picture) , the young Sathya was a vegetarian and was known for his aversion to animal cruelty and compassion for the poor, disabled and elderly. According to Kasturi and to Sathya Sai Baba himself, the young Sathya composed <a href="../../../b/h/a/Bhajans.html" title="Bhajans">bhajans</a> spontaneously (even as young as 8 years of age) and was talented in drama, dance, music and poetry. In a discourse in 1963 he claimed to be a reincarnation of <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiva.html" title="Shiva">Shiva</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakti.html" title="Shakti">Shakti</a> in 1963. <sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[43]</a></sup>. In the same discourse SSB said that <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shirdi_Sai_Baba_a85f.html" title="Shirdi Sai Baba">Shirdi Sai Baba</a> was an incarnation of Shiva and that his future reincarnation <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prema_Sai_Baba_ab9f.html" title="Prema Sai Baba">Prema Sai Baba</a> would be a reincarnation of Shakti. In contrast, Kasturi’s biography stated that Shirdi Sai Baba was to be Shakti incarnated and that Prema Sai Baba was to be an incarnation of Shiva.</p>
<p>In the late <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> he attracted Western spiritual seekers and became increasingly popular. One of those spiritual seekers was the Hollywood screenwriter <a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnold_Schulman_830c.html" title="Arnold Schulman">Arnold Schulman</a>, who wrote in his 1971 book called <i>Baba</i> that "For any episode of Baba's childhood, there are countless contrasting versions and, at this point, the author discovered that it was no longer possible to separate the facts from the legend." According to Schulman, contrasting versions about Baba's childhood may be due to the fact that he needed interpreters to interperet other interpreters (as in the case of his interview with Baba's sister). Schulman concluded that what the translators said may well have been quite different from what was actually said <sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>
<p>Sathya Sai Baba had several sisters, one older brother, the late Seshama Raju, and one younger brother, the late R. V.

<p>Sathya Sai Baba resides much of the time in his main <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashram.html" title="Ashram">ashram</a> called <i><a href="../../../p/r/a/Prashanthi_Nilayam_e905.html" title="Prashanthi Nilayam">Prashanthi Nilayam</a></i> (abode of peace) at Puttaparthi. In the hot summer Baba leaves for his other ashram called <i>Brindavan</i> in <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitefield%2C_India_1d44.html" title="Whitefield, India">Whitefield</a> (sometimes called Kadugodi), a town on the outskirts of <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangalore.html" title="Bangalore">Bangalore</a>. He regularly visited <a href="../../../k/o/d/Kodaikanal.html" title="Kodaikanal">Kodaikanal</a>. <a href="http://www.saibaba.ws/service/templeslearning/kodai.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.saibaba.ws/service/templeslearning/kodai.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> He has left India only once for a visit to <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_East_Africa_9bd1.html" title="North East Africa">North East Africa</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a>.</p>
<p>He is a prolific orator about religious topics in his native language <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telugu_language.html" title="Telugu language">Telugu</a> and he is regarded by some as an excellent speaker. Apart from his claim to be Shirdi Sai Baba, Satya Sai Baba also asserts that he is an <a href="../../../a/v/a/Avatar.html" title="Avatar">Avatar</a> of God, a reincarnation of Lord <a href="../../../r/a/m/Rama.html" title="Rama">Rama</a>, of Sri <a href="../../../k/r/i/Krishna.html" title="Krishna">Krishna</a>, the <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kalki.html" title="Kalki">Kalki</a> purna avatar (full divine incarnation), Lord <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiva.html" title="Shiva">Shiva</a>, and <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakti.html" title="Shakti">Shakti</a>. But he also says that everybody else is God and that the difference is that he is aware of this and others are not. <sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[47]</a></sup> He says that he is omniscient, omnipotent, and able to create matter from mere thought. He also stresses he is free from desires. Sai Baba claims to be pure, divine love.</p>
<p>Sathya Sai Baba can be seen in person performing what followers believe to be miracles daily in the form of materializations of small objects, for example food, jewelry such as bracelets, rings, watches and especially <a href="../../../v/i/b/Vibhuti.html" title="Vibhuti">vibhuti</a> (holy ash) and "kum kum" (the red-colored powder used by Hindus to make the ritual mark between the eyebrows). He says that he can <a href="../../../f/a/i/Faith_healer.html" title="Faith healer">heal</a> diseases of his devotees sometimes by his spiritual power and sometimes by taking on the disease himself. <sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[48]</a></sup>. There is <a href="../../../a/n/e/Anecdotal_evidence.html" title="Anecdotal evidence">anecdotal evidence</a> that supports this claim. Followers attribute many miracles to him which they claim have witnessed in his presence. There are international claims, from Sathya Sai Baba's followers and neutral observers, that vibuthi, kumkum, turmeric powder, holy water, brass statues of deities, sugar candy, fruits, herbs, amrita (a fragrant, nectar-like honey), gems and coloured string spontaneously manifest on the altars and pictures of Sathya Sai Baba in the privacy of their own homes. <sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[49]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="../../../i/c/e/Iceland.html" title="Iceland">Icelandic</a> psychology professor Erlendur Haraldsson wrote that he did not get Sathya Sai Baba's permission to study him under controlled circumstances but investigated and documented the guru's alleged miracles and manifestations by interviewing witnesses first-hand and compiling results from a questionnaire given to a sampling of 29 people, including 7 former followers. According to the people that Haraldsson interviewed, and the results to his questionnaire, many extraordinary miracles were attributed to Sathya Sai Baba such as <a href="../../../l/e/v/Levitation.html" title="Levitation">levitation</a> (both indoors and outdoors), <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bilocation.html" title="Bilocation">bilocation</a>, physical disappearances, changing granite into sugar candy, changing water into another drink, changing water into gasoline, producing objects on demand, changing the color of his gown into a different color while wearing it, multiplying food, healings, visions, dreams, making different fruits appear on any tree hanging from actual stems, controlling the weather, physically transforming into various deities and physically emitting brilliant light. These people also claimed that Sathya Sai Baba materialized many substances from his hand such as vibuthi, lost objects, statues, photographs, Indian pastries (both hot and cold), food (hot, cold, solid and fluid), out of season fruits, new banknotes, pendants, necklaces, watches and rings <sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[50]</a></sup>. Haraldsson wrote that the biggest materialized object that he saw was a mangalasutra necklace, 32 inches long, 16 inches long on each side <sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[51]</a></sup>. Haraldsson wrote that some miracles attributed or performed by the Baba resemble the ones described in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_39c4.html" title="New Testament">New Testament</a>, but also with some differences. According to Haraldsson, although healings certainly figure into Sai Baba's reputation, his impression is that healings do not play a prominent role in SSB's activities as in those of Jesus <sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[52]</a></sup></p>
<p>One important practice in his ashrams is <i><a href="../../../d/a/r/Darshan.html" title="Darshan">darshan</a></i> (spiritual sight). During <i>darshan</i> Sathya Sai Baba walks among his followers. He may listen to a few chosen persons, accept letters, or materialize and distribute <i><a href="../../../v/i/b/Vibhuti.html" title="Vibhuti">vibhuti</a></i> (sacred ash of Lord Shiva). Sathya Sai Baba claims that his <i>darshan</i> has spiritual benefits for those who attend it and this is consistent with Hindu beliefs regarding spiritual preceptors. Usually people wait hours to get a good place for <i>darshan</i>. Sathya Sai Baba sometimes invites people for a group interview with him in a room in the 'ashram's mandir' (Hindu temple). Sathya Sai Baba says he performs these miracles to attract people and then to transform them <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spirituality.html" title="Spirituality">spiritually</a>. He also makes assurances of divine protection to his devotees. Followers report help from Sai Baba in difficult or dangerous situations as well as in dreams. Followers consider it a great privilege to get such an interview. Sometimes a person from this group is invited for a private interview. When asked about the divinity of Sathya Sai Baba, many of his followers readily attest to it by accounting anecdotes about the numerous miraculous occurrences and strange coincidences they have experienced.</p>

<p>Sathya Sai Baba preaches love and the unity of all <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_religions.html" title="World religions">world religions</a> and asserts that people who follow him do not need to give up their original religion. His teachings are sometimes seen as completely <a href="../../../s/y/n/Syncretism.html" title="Syncretism">syncretic</a> (uniting all religions) and sometimes as Hindu. <a href="http://www.aaanet.org/aes/bkreviews/result_details.cfm?bk_id=363" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aaanet.org/aes/bkreviews/result_details.cfm?bk_id=363" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> He teaches among others a rather traditional form of Hinduism that has come from many <a href="../../../s/e/c/Sect.html" title="Sect">sects</a> and movements including <i><a href="../../../a/d/v/Advaita.html" title="Advaita">advaita</a></i>, occasionally drawing from other religions like <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikhism.html" title="Sikhism">Sikhism</a>, and <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>.

The only real Christian influence can be felt in the institution of regular Sunday School sessions for devotees.

<p>Across the globe local Sathya Sai Baba groups assemble to sing <i><a href="../../../b/h/a/Bhajan.html" title="Bhajan">bhajans</a></i> (Hindu devotional songs), study Sathya Sai Baba's teachings, do collective community service (called <i>seva</i>), and teach <i>Education in Human Values</i> (Sai <i><a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunday_School_35de.html" title="Sunday School">Sunday School</a></i>).

<p>SSB has been and still is the target of criticism by skeptics, ex-followers and other critics that question his claims to perform miracles and other paranormal feats. For example, in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a> the <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physics.html" title="Physics">physicist</a> <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rationalism.html" title="Rationalism">rationalist</a> and then the vice chancellor of <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangalore_University_4d17.html" title="Bangalore University">Bangalore University</a> Dr. <a href="../../../h/2E/_/H._Narasimhaiah_05c2.html" title="H. Narasimhaiah">H. Narasimhaiah</a> who founded and chaired <i>The Committee to Investigate Miracles and Other Verifiable Superstitions</i> publicly challenged Sathya Sai Baba to perform his miracles under controlled circumstances, a challenge which Sathya Sai Baba ignored. Sai Baba stated that the reason for his refusal was that the approach used by Narasimhaiah was improper <sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[55]</a></sup>. The committee exposed a boy called <i>Sai Krishna</i> as a fraud, that the committee alleged had Sathya Sai Baba's patronage <sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[56]</a></sup>. Sai Baba said, in one of his rare interviews with the press, that he had absolutely no connection to the exposed <i>Sai Krishna</i> and that there are people who masquerade as devotees who attempt to make money using his name <sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[57]</a></sup>. According to Erlendur Haraldsson, the formal challenge from the committee came to a dead end because the negative attitude of the committee was obvious and perhaps because of all the fanfare involved. As a result of this episode, a public debate raged for several months in Indian newspapers <sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[58]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the 1995 TV documentary <i>"Guru Busters"</i>, by UK's <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_4.html" title="Channel 4">Channel 4</a>, Sathya Sai Baba was accused of faking his materializations and a videotape was supplied alleging fraud. The same videotape was mentioned in the Deccan Chronicle, on November 23rd 1992, on a front page headline <i>"DD Tape Unveils Baba Magic"</i>. Erlendur Haraldsson stated that he and his associates carried out a careful analysis of the videotape shown in the <i>"Guru Busters"</i> documentary and mentioned by the Deccan Chronicle. Haraldsson stated that the videotape's quality and resolution left much to be desired and limited the inferences that could be drawn from it. Haraldsson claimed that Dr. Wiseman took the video to a company that specialized in coroporate fraud, and which possessed some of the world's best equipment designed to enhance poor quality videotapes. According to Haraldsson, after the videotape was enhanced using a three-fold process, the resulting tape contained no firm evidence of fraud. The same company analyzed several still frames from the videotape, enhanced and enlarged them and the images still did not reveal any further information <sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[59]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>According to an article published in a <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Age_1b86.html" title="New Age">New Age</a> magazine in the year 2000 by a critical former follower, a 1992 study of Sai Baba’s miracle by Dale Beyerstein was the first sound of substantial criticism. According to this article, Beyerstein questioned among others Sai Baba’s claim of omnipotence.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[60]</a></sup></p>
<p>The magazine <a href="../../../i/n/d/India_Today_c149.html" title="India Today">India Today</a> published on 4 December 2000 a cover story about the Baba and the allegations of fake miracles quoting the magician <a href="../../../p/2E/_/P._C._Sorcar%2C_Jr._81be.html" title="P. C. Sorcar, Jr.">P. C. Sorcar, Jr.</a> who considered the Baba a fraud. <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basava_Premanand_aa9a.html" title="Basava Premanand">Basava Premanand</a>, a skeptic and amateur magician, asserted that he has been investigating Sathya Sai Baba since 1968 and believes the guru to be a cheater and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlatan.html" title="Charlatan">charlatan</a>. Premanand also displayed, in the 2004 <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> documentary <i>Secret Swami</i>, that he could duplicate some of the same acts that SSB presents as miracles; such as materializations by <a href="../../../s/l/e/Sleight_of_hand.html" title="Sleight of hand">sleight of hand</a> and the production of a <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lingam.html" title="Lingam">lingam</a> from his mouth.</p>
<p>The British journalist Mick Brown discussed, in his 1998 book "The Spiritual Tourist", that the letters, from attending doctors, provided in the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_Skeptic_5679.html" title="Indian Skeptic">Indian Skeptic</a> magazine (published by Premanand) about SSB's claim of resurrecting Walter Cowan, as described in the books <i>My Baba and I</i> by the follower John Hislop and in SSB's authorized biography by Kasturi, was probably untrue <sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[61]</a></sup>. In this same book, Mick Brown also related his experiences with manifestations of vibuthi, from Sathya Sai Baba's pictures in houses in London, and felt that these miraculous manifestations were not fraudulent or the result of trickery <sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[62]</a></sup>. Brown further states there with regards to Sathya Sai Baba’s claim of omniscience that sceptics have produced documentation that shows clear discrepancies between Baba’s reading of historical events and biblical prophecies and the generally accepted accounts. <sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[63]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_6.html" title="June 6">June 6</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a> four people who were armed with knives were killed after they had intruded in Sai Baba's bedroom. The intruders had killed two aides of Sai Baba. The incident was widely published in the Indian press. SSB claimed in his 1993 Gurupurnima discourse on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_3.html" title="July 3">July 3</a> that jealousy among his followers was behind the incident, without giving a detailed explanation of the events <sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[64]</a></sup>. The former Secretary of the Home Minister of Andhra Pradesh, V.P.B. Nair who came from of a police background expressed in the BBC documentary his belief that the four assailants in 1993 had unnecessarily and illegally been shot by the police. Both Premanand and Nair wanted the case to be re-opened and believed that it had been silenced to prevent revelations about illegal practices by Sathya Sai Baba and his organizations.</p>
<p>The debates about Sathya Sai Baba were fueled by a document published in 2000 called <i>"The Findings"</i> <sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[65]</a></sup>, written by David and Faye Bailey (former followers who together wrote three books on Sathya Sai Baba <sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[66]</a></sup>), in which they described their disillusionment with the guru <sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[67]</a></sup>. <i>The Findings</i> led to a flood of allegations and fierce debates on the internet about the guru <sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[68]</a></sup>. According to an article in <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salon.com.html" title="Salon.com">salon.com</a> in the year 2001, a great part of the Findings contains testimonies of sexual harassment and sexual abuse <sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[69]</a></sup>. Apart from that, Faye wrote, in The Findings, that an unnamed college student requested David's help to stop SSB from sexually abusing other students <sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[70]</a></sup>. The Findings contain allegations of fakery, claims that SSB does not heal sick people and allegations of financial irregularities with charity projects, such as the Super Specialty Hospital and water project <sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#_note-66" title="">[71]</a></sup>. David Bailey previously wrote, in his two books about SSB, that he personally witnessed manifestations, healings, miracles and was saved from a nasty car accident by Sathya Sai Baba <sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[72]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>SSB is alleged to give "oilings" between the scrotum and anus, on the genitals, above the genitals, on the chest or on the head. The testimonies of sexual abuse of young men were shown in TV documentaries, including <i>"Seduced by Sai Baba"</i> by Denmark's national television, and documentary film <i>"Secret Swami"</i> by BBC. The <a href="../../../i/n/d/India_Today_c149.html" title="India Today">India Today</a> article referred to a signed <a href="../../../a/f/f/Affidavit.html" title="Affidavit">affidavit</a> in their possession by the Jens Sethi, a German man, who claimed to have been sexually abused as an adult by the Guru. The magazine wrote that although Sethi filed a criminal complaint in <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munich.html" title="Munich">Munich</a>, he did not file one in India. The TV documentary "<i>Seduced By Sai Baba</i>", produced by Denmark's national television and radio broadcaster <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danmarks_Radio_8397.html" title="Danmarks Radio">Danish radio</a> aired in <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denmark.html" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norway.html" title="Norway">Norway</a>. Al Rahm said in the <i>Secret Swami</i> programme that he talked with the highest leader in the USA (Dr. Michael Goldstein) about the alleged sexual abuse of his son by Baba, who was 18 at the time. According to Al Rahm, the leader responded by saying that he hated the idea of having wasted 25 years of his life and that he accepted SSB's statement <i>"Swami is pure"</i> as the truth. Dr. Goldstein, the International Chairman of the <i>Sri Sathya Sai Organisations</i>, stated in the BBC documentary <i>Secret Swami</i>, that although he felt that Sathya Sai Baba was not above the law, it was against his <i>"heart and conscience"</i> to believe the allegations because he had personally observed Baba interact with students very frequently, in very informal circumstances, and he had never seen anything inappropriate, ominous or anything indicative of fear or apprehension <sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[73]</a></sup>. <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Tigrett_9e07.html" title="Isaac Tigrett">Isaac Tigrett</a>, a prominent follower and co-founder of the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hard_Rock_Cafe_d94d.html" title="Hard Rock Cafe">Hard Rock Café</a>, stated in the documentary that his admiration for the Baba will not change even if the charges of <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia.html" title="Pedophilia">paedophilia</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murder.html" title="Murder">murder</a> were proved beyond all doubt <sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[74]</a></sup>. According to the journalist Michelle Goldberg of <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salon.com.html" title="Salon.com">salon.com</a> the fact that the Baba has high ranking Indian politicians as his supporters and the charity works done by the various organizations associated with the Baba help to explain why he has not been brought into a court of law in India. The Indian consulate website states that crime victims must file charges with the police. In the <i>India Today</i> magazine (dated December 2000) no complaints had been filed against the Guru, by any alleged victim, in India <sup id="_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#_note-70" title="">[75]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Kennedy Dominic, a journalist for The British newspaper <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Times_47ca.html" title="The Times">The Times</a>, reported in August 2001 that three men had died after placing hope in Sathya Sai Baba. According to the Times articles Michael Pender, an HIV infected man who overdosed on drugs more than once, complained to a friend that he had been repeatedly sexually molested by the guru. Pender apparently committed suicide in a hostel for the homeless in North London. Aran Edwards, a British national, was described as <i>"quite an ill person, mentally unstable and needed orthodox help"</i>, by David Bailey. Edwards was encouraged to write letters to the guru to help solve his <i>"psychological problems"</i>. Edwards had never traveled to see the guru first-hand. David Bailey said that he eventually told Edwards, <i>"Wake up. He doesn't even read these letters."</i> Edwards was so distraught about the situation, he decided to commit suicide. Edwards was found hanging from a staircase in his home in Cardiff, London. Andrew Richardson, another British national, hurled himself off a bank building in Bangalore, India. Two letters were found on his body in which he said he was in a deep depression. He expressed a desire to see Sai Baba and Mother Teresa. <sup id="_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#_note-71" title="">[76]</a></sup></p>
<p>SSB did not give a detailed public rebuttal to the accusations of sexual abuse. In his Christmas 2000 discourse SSB said that people disseminate false negative stories about him because they have been bribed <sup id="_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#_note-72" title="">[77]</a></sup>. According to Koert van der Velde, a reporter for a Dutch newspaper, SSB had forbidden people to take a look on the internet <sup id="_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#_note-73" title="">[78]</a></sup>. In the years 1999 and 2000 SSB has repeatedly belittled the internet and discouraged its use <sup id="_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#_note-74" title="">[79]</a></sup>. In 2003 SSB had an accident that injured his hip, according to the official of the Sathya Sai Organisation, Michael Goldstein. <a href="../../../a/s/_/As_of_2005.html" title="As of 2005">As of 2005</a>, SSB sometimes uses a wheelchair. <sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#_note-75" title="">[80]</a></sup></p>
<p>There are a couple of claims that Sathya Sai Baba can change into a woman instantaneously. For example, in a Dutch article entitled <i>"De Wonderdoener"</i>, Keith Ord claimed that he personally experienced Sathya Sai Baba literally transform his genitals from male to female. Keith Ord said that Baba was not a <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermaphrodite.html" title="Hermaphrodite">hermaphrodite</a> but, from one moment to the next, completely changed from male to female, with the corresponding genitals of each. Keith Ord felt this <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gender.html" title="Gender">gender</a> transformation was a type of <a href="../../../m/i/r/Miracle.html" title="Miracle">miracle</a> and expressed the opinion that Sai Baba lives on another level than mere mortals <sup id="_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#_note-76" title="">[81]</a></sup>. Alexandra Nagel, in her Dutch article, <i>De Sai Paradox</i>, also related the story of Tal Brooke, as taken from his book <i>Avatar of the night</i>, in which Brooke related an account from a man named "Patrick" who alleged that Baba had a vagina and that he had coital sex with the guru <sup id="_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#_note-77" title="">[82]</a></sup>. These puzzling accounts have led Alexandra Nagel to the conclusion that Baba is a <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intersexual.html" title="Intersexual">hermaphrodite</a>. Nagel argued, in her <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a> Dutch language article, <i>De Sai Paradox</i>, published by the <a href="../../../v/r/i/Vrije_Universiteit_719f.html" title="Vrije Universiteit">Free University Amsterdam</a> press, that this alleged <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_change.html" title="Sex change">sex change</a> may be related to Baba's claim to be the incarnation of both the male and female aspects of God, Shiva and Shakti respectively <sup id="_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#_note-78" title="">[83]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The critical former follower Glen Meloy described him as 'a demented demonic force' <sup id="_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#_note-79" title="">[84]</a></sup>. <a href="../../../t/a/l/Tal_Brooke_c7f5.html" title="Tal Brooke">Tal Brooke</a>, an <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evangelicalism.html" title="Evangelicalism">evangelical</a> Christian wrote in his book <i>Avatar of the Night</i> that SSB is a <a href="../../../f/a/l/False_prophet.html" title="False prophet">false prophet</a> and the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antichrist.html" title="Antichrist">Antichrist</a>, as (according to him) was predicted in the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a>.</p>

<p><a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Aitken_%28traveller%29_b560.html" title="Bill Aitken (traveller)">Bill Aitken</a> (a Sai Devotee, expert in comparative religion and author of the book <i>"Sathya Sai Baba: A life"</i>) stated that Sathya Sai Baba's reputation has only increased despite negative stories being published against the Guru, by rationalists, critics and skeptics, for at least a generation. Aitken contended that critics are so distemperate in their dislike that their vituperation comes across as near comical. Aitken also expressed the opinion that the BBC is ultimately governed by the Anglican establishment and does not criticize public icons like the Queen, who happens to be the head of the Anglican church. Aitken felt that the Church of England can have no objection to programmes that weaken perceived threats, such as the Sai Movement <sup id="_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#_note-80" title="">[85]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In an interview with an <i>Asian Voice</i> correspondent, Mr Ashok Bhagani, a trustee of the Sai Organisation in the UK, said that he believed the allegations in the <i>Secret Swami</i> BBC documentary were completely factless and baseless and have never been proved. Mr Bhagani also stated that when devotees are selected by Baba for a private interview, there is always someone else present in the room, and this is especially the case when women and children meet him <sup id="_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#_note-81" title="">[86]</a></sup>. Navin Patel, a biochemistry student at the Sathya Sai Arts College in Bangalore during the 1970s, told <i>Asian Voice</i> that he visited Baba's ashram many times and studied at Baba's college long enough to know the allegations are untrue. Patel claimed the <i>Secret Swami</i> BBC documentary was very misleading and was based on only two westerners who had their own monetary agendas. Patel expressed the opinion that western journalists were bashing Baba collectively <sup id="_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#_note-82" title="">[87]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The secretary of the Puttaparthi ashram, K. Chakravarthi, refused to comment on the accusations. Anil Kumar, Sathya Sai Baba's principal translator, believes that the controversy is part of Baba's divine plan and said that every great religious teacher has had to face criticism in his/her lifetime. Kumar said that allegations have been levelled at Sai Baba since childhood, but with every criticism Baba becomes more and more triumphant <sup id="_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#_note-83" title="">[88]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Thorbjørn Meyer, in a letter to the DR, called the allegations undocumented and untrue. In the <i>Seduced</i> documentary, Peter Pruzan stated that he believed Sathya Sai Baba is not a pedophile nor does he perform conjuring tricks. Pruzan claimed that he personally experienced Sathya Sai Baba's <i>"wholly extraordinary powers"</i> both in Baba's presence as well as in Denmark <sup id="_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#_note-84" title="">[89]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Lewis Kreydick, in a sworn and videotaped deposition <sup id="_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#_note-85" title="">[90]</a></sup>, said that he did not believe Alaya Rahm's sexual abuse allegations against Sathya Sai Baba because he had a very close relationship with Alaya during the time the alleged misconduct occurred. Kreydick testified that Alaya shared private information with him that he had not divulged to his own parents. Some of this information included Alaya's sexual activities with girls. Kreydick also testified that Alaya shared all the details to each of the interviews he had with Sathya Sai Baba in 1995 and 1997, and Alaya never made any comments suggesting wrongdoing, impropriety or sexual misconduct. Kreydick said that Alaya was very happy, smiling, laughing and full of self-confidence after his interviews. Kreydick further testified that he was present in some of these interviews in which Alaya was later to claim to have been sexually abused <sup id="_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#_note-86" title="">[91]</a></sup>. Kreydick's statements in his depositions are supported by eulogistic talks that were given by Alaya Rahm and his family at Sai Conferences shortly after the alleged misconduct was said to have occurred. The talks were recorded on audio cassettes, distributed through Sai Centers and transcribed <sup id="_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#_note-87" title="">[92]</a></sup>.</p>

"Sai Baba's principal English translator, Anil Kumar, was more forthcoming. Every great religious teacher, he said, had faced criticism in their lifetime.

"247 We were instead referred to Peter Pruzan, a professor at Copenhagen’s Business High School.<br />
248 00:46:56:06 00:47:00:02 He has been a faithful Sai Baba follower for many years.<br />
249 00:47:00:05 00:47:08:04 What is truth? That these people perhaps have had some experiences which they have experienced in their brains, in their minds.<br />
250 00:47:08:07 00:47:13:12 (JOUNALIST) They tell of direct, physical experiences as regards the pedophile interference.<br />
251 00:47:13:15 00:47:18:17 What is the truth? I am not saying that these people are lying -<br />
252 00:47:18:20 00:47:22:15 - that they are not telling what they think they have experienced.<br />
253 00:47:22:18 00:47:26:14 In Jerusalem there are hundreds of people<br />
254 00:47:26:17 00:47:31:13 - who are in psychiatric hospitals,<br />
255 00:47:31:16 00:47:38: 21 who are convinced that they have experienced Jesus. People can experience many things. It is not my errand here to talk to you about this<br />
256 00:47:38:24 00:47:44:02 You ask me for my reaction to what I have seen and heard, and I have given it.<br />
257 00:47:44:05 00:47:48:14 Do you mean that all that they say is completely untrue?<br />
258 00 47:48:17 00:47:51:08 If you ask me what I mean<br />
259 00:47:51:11 00:47:57:04 I would say that Sai Baba, his organisation and his teaching stand for love.<br />
260 00:47:57:07 00:48:04:17 I mean it stands for the message that we should become better people.<br />
261 00:48:04:20 00:48:10:21 It is an organisation that bases itself on the service of society. It shows us the way we should experience this.<br />
262 00:48:10:24 00:48:15:18 - But I asked you if Sai Baba is a pedophile?<br />
- No<br />
263 &#160;:48:16:21 00:48:22:12 We also showed Professor Pruzan the shots showing Sai Baba’s conjuring tricks.<br />
264 00:48:22:15 00:48:30:12 If you ask me whether what Sai Baba does is swindle, my answer is definitely not.<br />
265 00:48:30:15 00:48:37:05 I can answer like that because I have experienced it personally.<br />
266 00:48:37:08 00:48:44:06 Sai Baba does things, both on the plane of materialisations -<br />
267 00:48:44:09 00:48:50:11 and on other planes – such as with respect to health and healing.<br />
268 00:48:50:14 00:48:56:14 - that for me is completely clear evidence of certain powers -<br />
269 00:48:56:17 00:49:01:00 - that are beyond what a conjurer has.<br />
270 00:49:01:03 00:49:07:05 Experience that I have had have been both in India in proximity to Sai Baba -<br />
271 00:49:07:08 00:49:10:23 - but have truly also been in my home in Gentofte.<br />
272 00:49:11:01 00:49:14:24 They are of such a nature and of such power -<br />
273 00:49:15:02 00:49:19:16 that I am not for a moment in doubt of -<br />

"In an online essay called "<a href="http://www.saibaba-aclearview.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.saibaba-aclearview.com/" rel="nofollow">Sai Baba and Sex: A Clear View</a>," an American devotee named Ram Das Awle says, "First of all, I believe that Sathya Sai Baba is an Avatar, a full incarnation of God ... AND, from what I've read and heard, I'm inclined to think some of the allegations about Baba are probably true: It appears likely to me that He has occasionally had sexually intimate interactions with devotees." After several rambling paragraphs, the essay concludes that Sai Baba touches men to awaken their "kundalini" energy or to remove previous bad sexual karma, and that "any sexual contact Baba has had with devotees -- of whatever kind -- has actually been only a potent blessing, given to awaken the spiritual power within those souls. Who can call that 'wrong'? Surely to call such contact 'molestation' is perversity itself." "</li>

<i>"I had no idea what to make of the pictures. To have applied the vibuthi to the glass would have been possible, perhaps, although I could not imagine how. The vibuthi was too evenly distributed to have been applied with a brush or sponge. The pictures did not seem to me to have been tampered with in any way. Rather, the vibuthi seemed to have grown on the surface of the glass, just as Mr. Patel said it had. Even if placing vibuthi on the glass might have just about been possible, to have placed it between the picture and the frame, as was the case with some of the portriats, seemed to me to be too complicated and troublesome. It seemed preposterous to imagine Mr Patel and his family bent over frames and sheets of glass, fiddling with ash and screwdrivers. Anyway, why would anyone contrive such a spectacle? There was no apparent profit or gain to be had from it for Mr Patel. A large sign near the pictures urged visitors not to give money, but to 'leave only your troubles'"</i>.<br />
<i>"What other motive could he have had? It had, if anything, caused him considerable personal inconvience. His house was no longer his own. He entertained a constant stream of visitors and enquiries; he was required to maintain the shrine in proper order. He had long ago abandoned any thoughts of installing a snooker-table as he had originally planned. Besides, Mr Patel did not strike me as a man capable of deceit. His manner was humble, self-effacing, patently sincere. 'I am deeply blessed,' he said. Even questioning his account of the miracle I felt mean-spirited, a prisoner of rationalist thought. Perhaps it was better simply to accept it for what Mr Patel said it was, for what it seemed to be - the sparkle of holy ash enlivening the dreary suburb of Wealdstone. I walked away from Mr Patel's house with my head reeling, Austin at my side. His face still wore the same absorbed half-smile I had noticed when he was sitting in the ante-room."</i><br />
<i>"'So what did you think?' I asked."</i><br />
<i>"He walked along in silence for some moments, mulling it over. 'Well, if it's not a miracle,' he said at last, 'it's a wonderful fairy tale.'"</i><br />
<i>"I told friends about the vibuthi-covered portriats; they looked at me in a bemused, eyebrow-arching sort of way. It couldn't be true, because such things simply don't happen, do they? But then they hadn't seen it, and I had."</i><br />
<i>"The phenomenon of vibuthi appearing on photographs was not confined to Mr. Patel's house. I began to hear accounts of similar manifestations at houses and temples in Leicaster, in New York, Canada, Australia and, of course, in India. Shortly after the article appeared I received another telephone call, from someone I had nver met, inviting me to another house, also in North London, where vibuthi was said to be manifesting in even greater quantities than at Mr. Patel's."</i><br />
<i>"As soon as I stepped inside I was assailed by the familiar sweet smell of vibuthi...The vibuthi was everywhere as material evidence. Its profusion was staggering; its sweet smell penetrated every corner of the house."</i><br />

"In what is being described as a divine blessing, a staunch Sai Baba-devoted Isipingo family is experiencing what they say are miracles in their home - with the formation of ashes and kungum around their prayer place and walls, and the appearance of candy and honey dripping freely from the eyes of a Sai Baba statue. Widowed Rani Naicker, 50, a factory worker of Egret Crescent, Lotus Park, who shares a rented home with her three children, factory workers Sagren, 21, and Kumaran, 24, unemployed Nicole, 25, and her (Nicole's) three-year-old daughter Shenay, said they were blessed a day after the kavady festival in February, when Sagren noticed ashes forming on the top of a poster which featured Sai Baba's head. Since then, the family claims, there has been an overflow of ashes, kungum, turmeric powder, sugar candy and pink sweets, including the continuous dripping of sweet honey from a statue. These have mysteriously materialised. Ashes have also formed on several pictures of Sai Baba, Shridi Baba, Mother Mary and on the frame of a picture of Naicker's late husband, Manny Naicker."<br />

Devotees and tourists seeking cures for ailments and help with domestic problems have been flocking to a Durban home said to be blessed by the miracles of Sai Baba.<br />
Kay Pillay, 59, owner of the home in Silverglen, Chatsworth, said the miracles began 11 years ago when honey started forming on a framed picture of Sai Baba.<br />
"We knew it was the miracle of Baba, because we heard of it happening elsewhere. Soon we saw ash on the walls, kungu (coloured powder), turmeric powder, holy water, brass statues of deities, sugar candy, dates, prunes, cloves and coloured string representing the different deities," said Pillay. He said brass figurines representing deities appeared on auspicious religious days.<br />
...Visitors can see honey dripping across a framed picture of Sai Baba, and two red velvet-covered throne-like chairs with a little stool from which ashen footprints lead to a burning lamp. On the floor are offerings of sweetmeats by devotees.<br />
Pillay said every Wednesday and Saturday Baba's footprints are washed from the carpet and everything is cleaned. The following day, the powder and footprints reappear.</li>

Sathya Sai Baba: <i>"I can assure you there is absolutely no connection between him and Myself. His people have several times attempted to arrange a meeting between us, but we have refused their requests. Of course, thousands of people, as you saw this morning, come here for darshan. There are others also who masquerade as My disciples or make money using My name. As this happens not only here but in other states and even abroad, we cannot do anything about it.

"The Critics: <i>"In May of 1977 the committee let it be known that it would be going to Brindavan at a certain time in the hope that Baba would receive them. Off they went, in two busloads that included the committee members, journalists, photographers, and some other interested people, their expedition first being widely publicized. The guards at the gate at Brindavan did not let the grup enter the premises, with the exception of the only two women of the committee, Dr Vinoda Murthy...and Dr. Anupama Niranjana. But they would not go in unless all the commitee were admitted. Dr. Sundar Rao, an old devotee of Sai Baba, told the committee that Baba had instructed the guards not to let them and their entourage in and that he would not come out of his building until the committee left. There was never any investigation. The only formal challenge from the scientific community in India came to a dead end. Perhaps all the fanfare had not been the wisest way to ensure Baba's cooperation. The negative attitude of the committee was obvious, but Baba might not have participated in any investigation, regardless of how he had been approached. The episode started off a widely publicized controversy that raged in the newspapers for several months."</i></li>

Sai Baba is seen standing on the podium of the hall. Several people are seated at the back of the podium, facing the audience. A large and apparently heavy memento (probably 18 inched by 18 inches at its base) is brought in by an assistant, Mr. Radhakrishna Menon (RM). The memento, held with four hands by Sai Baba and RM, is handed over to the architect who designed the building, Mr. R. Chakrapani. Immediately after he receives it, Sai Baba makes a circular sweeping movement with his right hand, in which appears suddenly gold-coloured ornament or necklace, which he places around the neck of Mr. Chakrapani. This whole sequence of events takes about 17 seconds...The quality and resolution of the tape leaves much to be desired and limits the inferences that can be drawn from it. Dr. Wiseman took the videotape to a company which specialises in investigating corporate fraud. This company posesses some of the world's best equipment designed to enhance poor quality videotape. The technician kindly offered to enhance the videotape in question. The videotape was run thorugh a real time Snell &amp; Wilcox Kudos Noise Reducer. The machine carries out three operations. First, it removes via recursive filters the random noise on the tape caused by repeated copying. Second, it imporves the graininess of the video by median filters and finally enhances any edges on the video through edge enhancement filters. After all this the video is certainly easier to watch, and did not contain much of the random noise present on the copy provided by the Deccan Chronicle. However, the resulting tape still did not reveal further information about the incident. In short, the reason for Sai Baba's hand movements still appears unclear and is open for various interpretations, but the tape contained no firm evidence of fraud. The company also analysed several still frames taken from the video. These were scanned into a computer and run through an Improve image processing system (developed by the Home Office in Britain). Again, the images were enhanced via median filters and certain areas of the frames were enlarged. The resulting photographs show the crucial moment as Sai Baba's hands touch under the memento, but do not reveal any further information...The statement made by the Deccan Chronicle that Sai Baba takes the gold chain form his personal assistant is not corroborated by the tape or the picture they print."</i></li>

"After years of intensely sweet hope in February '93 the dream got disturbed. Of course, there had been instances for reading negative opinions on Baba before. But the study by Dale Beyerstein was the first sound of criticism sufficiently substantiated to be taken seriously. The sense of acute dilapidation which then took hold of me will remain with me for life.<br />
Here as well it were the details which convinced. For instance with regard to Baba’s supposed creation of a so-called ‘lingam’ (an ovally shaped smooth stone), which he annually coughed up from his throat with Mahasivarathri. Among others, Beyerstein quotes the devotees themselves: "Baba has said He often finds it difficult to postpone or prevent the formation of lingams within Him". (N. Kasturi, quoted in Beyerstein 1992, 71). Remarkable of course: God finding something difficult... While vomiting up a lingam is a fairly common feat among Indian ‘holy men' in general, as tells us the great Houdini by another quotation. It is done by just (be it after some training) swallowing one in advance — with the proviso that regurgitation of the lingam is to take place within due time after that... Another example concerned the American Walter Cowan, who by Baba's grace was supposed to have been resurrected from the dead — a story which both personnel concerned as well as the doctors in question forcibly refuted."

'It won't fit', He added, trying to push the ring on to the fourth finger on his left hand. 'Try', He said to the man, and then to several others sitting in the room. No way would it go past his knuckle, so Swami held the ring with his two fingers, slipped it off and blew on it once, then slipped the ring back on...a perfect fit. Then He smiled and waved His hand in the air again. It seemed, in slow motion, that a gold bracelet with a watch in it dropped from the centre of His palm...'For you', He said to one of the ladies. 'Check the time', He added...it was correct!"<br /></i> A Journey to Love (page 80), David Bailey: "He waved His right hand in the air, and, slowly, from about 4 inches under His hand, in mid-air, appeared the most beautiful Japamala (rather like a set of rosary beads, with 108 beads) in silver and crystal."<i><br /></i> A Journey to Love (page 65), David Bailey: <i>"Swami waved His right hand in the air in a clockwise circular motion and under His hand in mid-air appeared the most astonishingly huge diamond ring. 'Give me the fourth finger of your left hand. It will fit.' He slid it on and it was fantastic, a perfect fit. I could not believe my eyes."</i><br />
A Journey to Love (page 104), David Bailey: <i>"I have seen (and there are countless recorded incidents) of Him touching critically ill people in wheelchairs, with cancer, etc., and they were healed."</i><br />
A Journey to Love (page 78, 79), David Bailey: <i>"Swami had called this Indian family along with a very, very elderly lady, who was in a wheelchair. The family started to push her towards Swami, when He apparently said, 'No, walk!' This lady got up from out of the wheelchair, the first time for 15 years we discovered, and walked elegantly up to the interview room and entered inside. This next part I saw. The door closed, and, as Swami had promised He would talk to me, I knew I must wait. I went in and the elderly lady was sitting on the floor. I sat next to her. Swami made some vibuthi for us, and then took the Australians in for their private interview. What happened next was a moment that I shall never forget in all my life. Swami invited the Indian family into the inner room. The two sons came to help the elderly lady up off the floor. 'No no' Swami said, 'Bhagavan here.' He raised His hands in the air, palms pointing down towards her, and I find the following few moments very difficult to put into words. As I was sitting beside her I felt exactly what happened. Energy poured out of His hands in a kind of circular motion, it was not like an elecrtical energy, it was sheer love, so powerful it was almost a glimpse of Heaven. I burst into floods of tears, I couldn't help it, the feeling was so beautiful. The elderly lady got up like a three year old and went into the inner room."</i><br />
A Journey to Love, Book 2 (page 52, 53, 55), David Bailey: <i>"...I was so tired, I could hardly see the road ahead. Faye had left for Australia, so I was driving alone. Well, I don't remember driving into the Welsh village - I must have dropped off to sleep. The next thing I knew was the car stopping two inches away from windows of a double glass fronted shop to my left, and a large delivery lorry two inches to my right. This lorry had been delivering lots of plastic dustbins, seed trays, etc. My eyes opened to see all of this in mid air, as I had obviously driven straight into them like one of the old Laurel and Hardy films. This activated my sense of humour, and I immediately laughed, before realising the reality of the situation. My car had neatly parked with expert precision. Two inches either way and there would have been a nasty accident. There was no damage to anything and I was unhurt...If I had taken the train I might have been late, but very much alive!!!! Because of my thoughtlessness I needed the love that flows through Swami to save me, even though my little voice had told me what to do....I held his hand, and when a quiet moment came whispered, 'Swami, thank You for saving my life!' He looked down at me and I melted with the love that poured through Him and He very slowly said, 'Yes...I know.'"</i></li>

One of them had complained of being repeatedly sexually molested by Sai Baba at his ashram in Puttaparthi near Bangalore. Michael Pender, an HIV-positive student, was found dead at a London hostel after taking alcohol and painkillers. He had already tried to commit suicide at the holy man's headquarters. Aran Edwards hanged himself at home in Cardiff after joining a Sai Baba support group and being encouraged to write to the guru to solve his psychological problems. Mr Edwards sent a flurry of anxious letters but was devastated after receiving no replies and being told that the guru did not read his mail.<br />
Mr Pender, known as 'Mitch,' was found dead after taking tablets in the lonely bedroom of a hostel for the homeless in Highbury, North London. He was 23. ...He tried to commit suicide in the ashram. He had overdosed on drugs more than once. He had some strange, very powerful experiences there...<br />
'He was quite an ill person, mentally unstable and needed orthodox help. In the end, he wrote a couple of dozen or more letters to Sai Baba. The group had told him this was what to do. He used to ring me from phone boxes pleading with me. There were 35 phone calls, I suppose . . . he was absolutely desperate that I should talk to Sai Baba for him because he was in such a state and had written all these letters which he had sent out and hadn't had a reply. Could I please help because I was Sai Baba's right-hand man?' At the end I said, 'Wake up. He doesn't even read these letters'. He was so distraught about the situation, he decided to commit suicide.' Aran Edwards, a single man, was found hanged from a staircase at his home in Cardiff, on April 19, 1999. He was 37. A suicide verdict was recorded by the coroner.<br />
On September 19, 1996, Mr Richardson travelled to Bangalore and hired a taxi at the railway station to one of the city's tallest buildings, the State Bank of Mysore. Mr Richardson flung banknotes and travellers' cheques in the air, ran into the bank and up the stairs to the eighth floor, where he smashed a window and leapt 84ft to the ground, killing himself. He was 33. Two letters were found on his body. One to Sai Baba outlined his quest for spiritual enlightenment. The second was a suicide note saying he was in a deep depression: 'I came to India in search of peace but could not find it.' His mother, Deirdre, at her home near Pietermaritzburg, said: 'Andrew wanted to see Sai Baba, but was also heading to Calcutta to see Mother Teresa . . . All he wanted to do was work with the poor.'"</i></li>

<li id="_note-76"><b><a href="#_ref-76" title="">^</a></b> Dutch original by Piet van der Eijk under the title "De Wonderdoener" in the magazine HP/De Tijd, dated 31/1/1992, pages. 46-50: English Translation: <i>"Keith, (26), says that when he had been chosen for a personal meeting, Sai Baba said to him that he thought too much about girls. But on a another occasion Baba went further. "Suddenly he pulled down my trousers and tried to excite me sexually. He took my hand and put it on his genitals. Then I noticed that Sai Baba was dual-gendered: not that he was half-female half-male, not a hermaphrodite, no, from one moment to the next he changed from male into female, completely with the appropiate genitals. Don't ask me how this is can be, but that is how I experienced it. It must be some sort of miracle too. Obviously Sai Baba lives on another level from mere mortals." This is what Keith Ord tells us and we only repeat it."</i><br />
Original Dutch: <i>"Keith, (26), vertelt dat Sai Baba hem zei, toen hij was uitverkoren voor een persoonlijke ontmoeting, dat hij teveel aan de meisjes dacht. Maar op een volgende gelegenheid ging Baba verder. "Onverhoeds trok hij mijn broek naar beneden en probeerde hij mij seksueel op te winden. Hij nam mijn hand en legde het op zijn geslachtsorgaan. Toen merkte ik dat Sai Baba tweeslachtig was: niet dat hij half-vrouw half-man was, geen hermafrodiet, nee, van het ene ogenblik op het andere veranderde hij van man in vrouw, compleet met de geslachtsorganen die daarbij horen. Vraag me niet hoe dat kan, maar ik heb het zo ervaren. Het moet ook een soort wonder zijn. Kennelijk leeft Sai Baba toch op een ander niveau dan gewone stervelingen." Dit is wat Keith Ord ons vertelt en wij geven het maar door."</i></li>

It is totally unclear whether Swallow knew about Sai Baba's acts with young men and his hermaphrodism. From the way in which she portrayed Baba as an incarnation of Shiva, one could infer that she would have found it normal and appropriate that those events take place. Because Baba shows in his private surroundings his side of the 'supreme lover' and combines this in addidition with Shiva-Shakti, the male-female form."</i><br />

Dutch original: <i>"Middels deze laatste opmerking wordt aannemelijk waarom Sai Baba's sexuele handelingen zoals Brooke en Ord ze naar voren hebben gebracht, grotendeels onder de oppervlakte zijn gebleven: het merendeel van zijn devotees is niet open genoeg om de symboliek te kunnen begrijpen of te accepteren. Totaal onduidelijk is evenwel of Swallow kennis heeft genomen van Sai Baba's handelingen met jongemannen en zijn tweeslachtigheid. Uit de wijze waarop zij Baba als een incarnatie van Shiva heeft geportretteerd, zou afgeleid kunnen worden dat ze het niet meer dan normaal of passend zou vinden dat die gebeurtenissen plaatsvinden. Want Baba toont in de privé-omgeving zijn kant van 'opperste geliefde' en combineert dit bovendien met Shiva-Shakti, de man-vrouw vorm."</i> Referentie: Swallow, Deborah A. 1982 <i>Ashes and Powers: myth, rite and miracle in an Indian God-man's cult</i>.

<i>"10:43:37: Well, not right away. But on the trip, we got to be very close, and he told me a lot of things about what he was up to.<br />
10:43:55: A. Well, we talk about a lot of things. And on the trip, he shared a lot more things. We got to be very close on this trip.<br />
10:45:45: Q. Did he share with you during that trip that -- and he was 16 years old when he went with you to India?<br />
10:45:56: A. Yeah.<br />
10:45:56: Q. Did he share with you that at that time, he was sexually active?<br />
10:46:01: A. Yeah, he did.<br />
10:47:03: A. He told me, but now -- it was so long ago, I can't remember. But he was 14 or 15 that he started his occasional relationships. And he was very active.<br />
10:47:15: Q. Did he indicate to you whether he had shared the fact that he was sexually active with his parents at tht time?<br />
10:47:21: A. I don't think he told his parents. We were just real close. And I don't even feel good about telling you about this now. It was kind of a personal thing between us. But he liked talking to me and I liked talking to him. And he wanted to know, really, the right thing to do.<br />
11:04:30: Q. When Alaya came out of that interview, describe for me his demeanor.<br />
11:04:44: A. Well, he was carrying an orange robe that Baba had given him. And he had gotten a ring there also. And he was very happy.<br />
11:04:57: Q. Was he smiling?<br />
11:04:59: A. Smiling, laughing, talking, and full of self-confidence.<br />
11:35:09: Q. Did Alaya ever express to you during these discussions that he didn't want to go back to see Sai Baba?<br />
11:35:18: A. No. To the contrary. He was one of the most excited guys to go on this trip.<br />
11:43:07: Q. And did Alaya tell you about those interviews when you arrived in India?<br />
11:43:16: A. He told me -- he told me about the interviews.<br />
11:43:20: Q. What did he tell you?<br />
11:43:21: A. He told me that it's just been phenomenal how Baba's pulled our group in and given us all the attention. And he already at that time, you know, made some jewelry for them. And given them a lot of attention. He was very happy. He was very happy that I was back there.<br />
11:43:39: Q. Did he tell you that Sai Baba touched him inappropriately in any way.<br />
11:43:48: A. No.<br />
11:43:49: Q. Did he -- did Alaya express any concerns to you, or refuse to talk to you about what had happened? Anything like that?<br />
11:43:57: A. Not at all.<br />
11:44:02: A. No. He wanted to bring me up to date. He wanted to fill in what I had missed, okay. And so he told me everything. And then, of course, I was there for all the rest of the interviews. I didn't go into most of the interviews. But after the interviews, we would share what happened.<br />
11:46:36: A. No. He shared almost every day what happened with Baba because, see, I wasn't in most of the interviews and he was in most of the interviews. So after -- we would get together every day that we had an interview. We were there for six weeks. And he had had 14 interviews in those six weeks. So after the interview, we'd get together with at the Rahm's apartment, and we would just find out from people that were in the interview what happened, and we would share with everybody. Because we were kind of a nuclear family. Then after that Alaya would talk to me in the garden right next to the place, and tell me even more things. Because some of the private interviews he had with Baba, he just didn't want to share with, all the details with his family.<br />
11:52:22: Did Alaya say, this is a secret. I'm really -- I don't want you to share this with anybody?<br />
11:52:30: A. No, no. He told me things he wouldn't tell his parents. But that wasn't one of the things that he wouldn't tell his parents.<br />
11:53:17: Q. And did he seem excited and happy about his encounters with Sai Baba?<br />
11:53:22: A. He was over the moon about thes encounters. And he loved sharing with me because I loved to hear it with Sai Baba. And I really liked Alaya a lot. And I was happy he was getting all this attention. It was very good for him.<br />
11:53:34: Q. So you and Alaya would speak privately almost every day?<br />
11:53:38: A. Every day, yeah, at least. And we'd talk to each other going to Darshan and coming back. We talked to each a lot.<br />
11:53:46: Q. So you and he spent quite a bit of time alone?<br />
11:53:49: A. We hung out. We hung out -- we didn't mean to be alone, but sometimes you are alone. We included everybody else, but a lot of times, we were just by ourselves.<br />
13:48:36: Q. When you heard that Alaya Rahm was alleging that he had been sexually molested by Sai Baba during his '95 and '97 trips to India, were you shocked?<br />
13:49:16: A. I couldn't believe it.<br />
13:49:21: Q. Why not?<br />
13:49:21: A. Well, I just, it was just out of the realm of possibility, as far as I am concerned.<br />
13:49:30: Q. And was it because of your own personal observations of Alaya Rahm after his interviews with Sai Baba?<br />
13:49:37: A. Yeah. He was very happy. Nothing was -- and he shared everything with me. We were so close. I don't know what's happened actually."</i></li>
