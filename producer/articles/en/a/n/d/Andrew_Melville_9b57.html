<p>He was born at Baldovy near <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montrose%2C_Angus_faba.html" title="Montrose, Angus">Montrose, Angus</a>, the youngest son of Richard Melville (brother to Melville of Dysart); his father died at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Pinkie_d3cd.html" title="Battle of Pinkie">Battle of Pinkie</a> in 1547, fighting in the van of the Scottish army. Andrew's mother died soon after, and the orphan was cared for by his eldest brother Richard (1522-1575).</p>
<p>At an early age Melville began to show a taste for learning, and his brother did everything in his power to give him the best education. He learned the rudiments of <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_language.html" title="Latin language">Latin</a> at the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammar_school.html" title="Grammar school">grammar school</a> of Montrose, after leaving which he learned <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_language.html" title="Greek language">Greek</a> for two years under Pierre de Marsilliers, a Frenchman whom <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Erskine_of_Dun_c821.html" title="John Erskine of Dun">John Erskine of Dun</a> had persuaded to settle at Montrose; such was Melville's proficiency that on going to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_St_Andrews_7dcc.html" title="University of St Andrews">University of St Andrews</a> he astonished the professors by using the Greek text of <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristotle.html" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, which no one else there understood. On completing his course, Melville left St Andrews with the reputation of "the best poet, philosopher, and Grecian of any young master in the land."</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Melville_9b57.html" title="Edit section: Travels and study in Europe">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Travels and study in Europe</span></h2>
<p>In 1564, at nineteen years of age, he set out for <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> to complete his education at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Paris_9ce6.html" title="University of Paris">University of Paris</a>. He applied himself to Oriental languages, but also attended the last course of lectures delivered by <a href="../../../a/d/r/Adrianus_Turnebus_2c85.html" title="Adrianus Turnebus">Adrianus Turnebus</a>, professor of Greek, as well as those of <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petrus_Ramus_78dc.html" title="Petrus Ramus">Petrus Ramus</a>, whose philosophical method and plan of teaching Melville later introduced into the universities of Scotland. From Paris he went to <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poitiers.html" title="Poitiers">Poitiers</a> (1566) to study <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_law_%28legal_system%29.html" title="Civil law (legal system)">civil law</a>, and though only twenty-one was apparently at once made a regent in the college of St Marceon. After three years, however, political troubles compelled him to leave France, and he went to <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva.html" title="Geneva">Geneva</a>, where he was welcomed by <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodore_Beza_207a.html" title="Theodore Beza">Theodore Beza</a>, at whose instigation he was appointed to the chair of humanity in the academy of Geneva.</p>
<p><a name="Return_to_Scotland" id="Return_to_Scotland"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Melville_9b57.html" title="Edit section: Return to Scotland">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Return to Scotland</span></h2>
<p>In addition to teaching, Melville continued to study Oriental literature, and in particular acquired from Cornelius Bertram, one of his brother professors, a knowledge of <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syriac_language.html" title="Syriac language">Syriac</a>. While he lived at Geneva the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massacre_of_St_Bartholomew_8296.html" title="Massacre of St Bartholomew">massacre of St Bartholomew</a> in 1572 drove immense numbers of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant.html" title="Protestant">Protestant</a> refugees to that city, including several of the most distinguished French men of letters of the time. Among these were several men learned in civil law, and political science, and associating with them increased Melville's knowledge and enlarged his ideas of civil and ecclesiastical liberty. In 1574 Melville returned to Scotland, and almost immediately received the appointment of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Principal_%28university%29.html" title="Principal (university)">Principal</a> of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Glasgow_4a0a.html" title="University of Glasgow">University of Glasgow</a>, and began its renewal.</p>
<p>Melville set himself to establish a good educational system. He enlarged the <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curriculum.html" title="Curriculum">curriculum</a>, and established chairs in languages, science, philosophy and divinity, which were confirmed by charter in 1577. His fame spread, and students flocked from all parts of Scotland and beyond. He assisted in the reconstruction of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Aberdeen_226b.html" title="University of Aberdeen">University of Aberdeen</a> in 1575, and in order to do for St Andrews what he had done for Glasgow, he was appointed Principal of <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Mary%27s_College%2C_St_Andrews_3899.html" title="St Mary's College, St Andrews">St Mary's College, St Andrews</a>, in 1580. His duties there comprised the teaching of <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theology.html" title="Theology">theology</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_language.html" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a>, Chaldee, Syriac and <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabbinical.html" title="Rabbinical">Rabbinical</a> languages.</p>
<p>Melville created a fashion for the study of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_literature.html" title="Greek literature">Greek literature</a>. The reforms, however, which his new modes of teaching involved, and even some of his new <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctrine.html" title="Doctrine">doctrines</a>, such as the non-infallibility of Aristotle, brought him into conflict with other teachers in the university. He was <a href="../../../m/o/d/Moderator_of_the_General_Assembly_of_the_Church_of_Scotland_e6fb.html" title="Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland">Moderator of the General Assembly</a> in 1582, and took part in the organization of the Church and the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presbyterian.html" title="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a> method. Troubles arose from the attempts of the court to force a system of <a href="../../../e/p/i/Episcopacy.html" title="Episcopacy">episcopacy</a> upon the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Scotland_1b71.html" title="Church of Scotland">Church of Scotland</a>, and Melville prosecuted one of the <a href="../../../t/u/l/Tulchan.html" title="Tulchan">Tulchan Bishops</a> (Robert Montgomery, d. 1609). For this he was summoned before the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Privy_Council_of_the_United_Kingdom_f410.html" title="Privy Council of the United Kingdom">Privy Council</a> in February 1584, and had to flee into <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> in order to escape a charge of <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treason.html" title="Treason">treason</a>.</p>
<p>After twenty months he returned to Scotland in November 1585, and in March 1586 resumed his lectures in St Andrews, where he continued for twenty years; he became <a href="../../../r/e/c/Rector.html" title="Rector">Rector</a> of the University in 1590. During the whole time he protected the liberties of the Scottish Church against all encroachments of the government. That in the main he was fighting for the constitutionally guaranteed rights of the Church is generally accepted. The chief charge against Melville is that his fervour often led him to forget the reverence due to an "anointed monarch." When the king acted in an arbitrary and illegal manner he needed the reminder that though he was king over men he was only "God's silly vassal." Melville's rudeness (if it is to be called so) was the outburst of just indignation from a man zealous for the purity of religion and regardless of consequences to himself.</p>
<p>He made this statement to King James VI of Scotland, later to become King James I of England.</p>
<p>"Sirrah, ye are God's silly vassal; there are two kings and two kingdoms in Scotland: there is king James, the head of the commonwealth; and there is Christ Jesus, the king of the Church, whose subject James the Sixth is, and of whose kingdom he is not a king, not a lord, not a head, but a member."</p>

<p>In 1599 he was deprived of the rectorship, but was made dean of the faculty of theology. The close of Melville's career in Scotland was at length brought about by <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_I_of_England_1562.html" title="James I of England">James</a> in characteristic fashion. In 1606 Melville and seven other clergymen of the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Scotland_1b71.html" title="Church of Scotland">Church of Scotland</a> were summoned to <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> in order "that His Majesty might treat with them of such things as would tend to settle the peace of the Church." The contention of the whole of these faithful men was that the only way to accomplish that purpose was a free Assembly. Melville delivered his opinion to that effect in two long speeches with his accustomed freedom, and, having shortly afterwards written a sarcastic Latin <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epigram.html" title="Epigram">epigram</a> on some of the ritual practised in the chapel of <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hampton_Court_Palace_67f8.html" title="Hampton Court Palace">Hampton Court Palace</a>, and some eavesdropper having relayed it to the king, he was committed to the <a href="../../../t/o/w/Tower_of_London_bcf4.html" title="Tower of London">Tower of London</a>, and detained for four years. On being freed, but refused permission to return to his own country, he was invited to fill a professor's chair in the University of Sedan, and there he spent the last eleven years of his life.</p>
