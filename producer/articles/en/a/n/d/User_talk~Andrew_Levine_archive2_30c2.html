<p>Hello Andrew Levine, <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoogie_man_9493.html" title="User:Googie man">Googie Man</a> here and I want to ask you something as a fellow baseball fan on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_db2d.html" title="User:Jimbo">Jimbo</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_Beesley_e0b3.html" title="User:Angela Beesley">Angela</a> have made a new webstie called <a href="http://baseball.wikicities.com/wiki/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://baseball.wikicities.com/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Wikicities</a>. This link in particular will take you to the baseball Wikicity. As you'll see it's similar to Wikipedia, but my hope is this will allow baseball fans to do more and different things, like reporting on games, in depth statistics, create mulitple pages for pictures, and whatever else baseball fans care to create. You've done great work on Wikipedia and I was hoping you could help get this baseball Wikicity off the ground. Please let me know what you think either at my talk page, or you can email me at terry@wikia.com. Thanks! <b><a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoogie_man_9493.html" title="User:Googie man"><font color="green">Googie Man</font></a><sup><font color="green">(<a href="../../../g/o/o/User_talk%7EGoogie_man_7073.html" title="User talk:Googie man"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>)</font></sup></b>, 19:56, 5 January 2006 (UTC).</p>

<p>Excellent work on an excellent article. You aren't the kindest person I've met, but I know good work when I see it and I want to congratulate you. I am sorry some people are so indulged in their own "intellect" that they think that this article should not be featured. Again, good work.</p>

<p>It doesn't hurt <a href="../../../k/r/a/Krazy_Kat_dd6c.html" title="Krazy Kat">Krazy Kat</a>, and I think you will get FA status, but whether or not you find it disorienting a lot of research in graphic design has shown that alternating image placement is the best strategy as it reinforces the sweep of our eyes across the page and, most importantly, keeps people reading (as long as the text isn't boring, of course). I follow this in all my articles (see <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slide_Mountain_%28New_York%29_2d5c.html" title="Slide Mountain (New York)">Slide Mountain (New York)</a> and my latest project <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snowshoe.html" title="Snowshoe">snowshoe</a>, for examples.</p>

<p>Hi Andrew, this is just to let you know I haven't forgotten about your request for a missing article list. I'm just waiting for new database dumps to show up at <a href="http://download.wikipedia.org/" class="external free" title="http://download.wikipedia.org/" rel="nofollow">http://download.wikipedia.org/</a>. When this happens, I'm going to generate the list.</p>
<p>The perl script to generate such a list is at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Missing_encyclopedic_articles_fr_2e69.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Missing encyclopedic articles/fr">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Missing encyclopedic articles/fr</a>. You can adapt it to your requirements and run it yourself, if you are familiar with perl; but I wouldn't recommend running it on a month-old database dump, as it will be missing a lot of interwiki links. <a href="../../../e/u/g/User%7EEugene_van_der_Pijll_eaa2.html" title="User:Eugene van der Pijll">Eugene van der Pijll</a> 23:20, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

I just had a question, as a relative newcomer to <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>. You said <i>"The external links sprinkled throughout the article should be converted to proper inline citations."</i> I'm not quite sure what you mean by "proper inline citations".</p>
<p>I (now) realize that the external links should be grouped together at the end of the article under a "References" section, and will be doing so tomorrow. I was under the impression from <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> that footnote-style citations are somewhat controversial on WP. <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> does not seem to indicate a preference for the Harvard style over direct external links in the article, and I have a personal preference for the direct external link for readability and aesthetics.</p>
<p>I personally would like to use a combination of direct external links for online sources and the footnoting system for print sources, because as a former history major Chicago style is ingrained, plus I think it just looks more pleasing. For print sources, it's going to have to be either Chicago or Harvard anyway. Would you mind clarifying and/or giving me a bit of guidance on the issue? Even if not, your help is already appreciated. - <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDharmabum420_04df.html" title="User:Dharmabum420">dharmabum</a> 07:41, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I took out the quotes section. I was aware that lists of quotes are <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> (although there are exceptions), but not that Quotes sections were "deprecated" which I found in <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_layout_59d5.html#Quotations" title="Wikipedia:Guide to layout">Wikipedia:Guide to layout#Quotations</a>. I also tried to address two of your other points, if you'd like to check them out — the mention of discordianism and the founding fathers cite.

<p>Hello. Someone has written a "Democrat Party" article that dignifies this perjorative term. The correct name of the party, of course, is "Democratic Party."

With regards to the age of the charcter in the infobox in the <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lester_Freamon_2523.html" title="Lester Freamon">Lester Freamon</a> article being 30, that was a compete oversight on my part.

I've moved it to 50s but left the citation needed tag.

<p>Hi, you recently voted "Weak oppose" to the FA canidate <a href="../../../h/o/u/Household_income_in_the_United_States_63de.html" title="Household income in the United States">Household income in the United States</a>/ As reasoning for your vote you cited several copyedit related issues and suggested adding wiki-links to all states in the "Household income by state" table. I ran a complete spell and grammar check and conducted several copyedits. I also followed your suggestion of Wiki-linking all states in the table. I was wondering whether or not you are willing to look at the article once more. Thank you.

<p>Mr Levine, unfortunately you should not have removed those tags. Gettyimages Inc offered to purchase most of my photographs from Caucasus and Ethiopia. I just made a deal with them and transferred most of the photos to their database. They were sold to them and gettyimages copyrighted those images under their company. If you leave those images, it will be a direct violation of copyright against gettyimages inc. If Wikipedia fails to delete them, I will report to Gettyimages distribution department and im sure they will take action. When they were uploaded, i released the rights of those images. However, as of today they are sold and copyrighted to a large photo distribution company. Please re-attach the tags and proceed with deletion. Otherwise, you probably should contact Gettyimages and settle the copyright violation by Wikipedia directly with their management. In compliance with rules and guidelines regarding copyrights materials, you should follow proper procedures to avoid legal constraints which this situation will cause.

<dd>According to the licensing you agreed to with Kholkoi, "the copyright holder has <b>irrevocably released all rights</b> to it" (bold in the original).

<p>Hi Andrew (I assume that's your real name!). I can see our discussion is veering towards an argument rather than a debate. While I respect your opinion, which is clear from your desire to see the article deleted, I do not agree with it. This isn't going to change no matter how many times we go backwards and forwards, I believe artistic merits outweigh guidelines. If you have a look at my contributions to Wikipedia, I am helping with the Films project and I really want to make it the best it can be. I an not just some mildly interested party who likes a debate. I truely think the film in question is an example of an unusual film-making technique. The example you gave me while similar is actually different, an anthology of shorts by many directors isn't the same as a whole narrative by one director. I'm not expecting you to cave in and withdraw the AfD I'm just asking that perhaps the tone of the debate could be taken down a notch as some of the comments made have been dismissive, and I shouldn't be demanding you find me examples of things. I hope there are no hard feelings. James. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallanox_1ced.html" title="User:Mallanox">Mallanox</a> 20:52, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Andrew, I don't appreciate your unilateral deletion of PCD YRUU, JPD YRUU, and other District-level YRUU articles. I don't know if it's just that you have something against Unitarian Universalists, or that you wish to limit the scope of this encyclopedia, but if you'll notice, all of the district-level UUA articles were kept, in their AFD. PCD YRUU in particular had much more content than any of those articles. I consider this a misuse of your administrative powers, and wish you to revert your actions. I'm happy to discuss the matter. However, this is an unfair debate. You've already deleted the articles, and I can't do jack shit about it, if you'll allow me to be frank. This is one example of why I have such a strong disdain for speedy deletes. <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHellaNorCal_013f.html" title="User:HellaNorCal">HellaNorCal</a> 06:34, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. Thanks. I'm flattered, but have some concerns. Wouldn't I just become a lightning rod for more attacks on Wiki? Plus, I can see a whole list of conservative editors who would go bananas.

<p>If the media file isn't of use or interest then no reason why it should stay. There is an inherent tension between what I want to do, which is to anchor, however ephemerally, a physical location to a piece of information.

I've tried to respond to your comment on adding information "from outside accounts with less of a cultural attachment to the subject" by expanding the section on responsibilty for the tragedy and adding several citations to non-Mormon scholar Wallace Stegner. I've also added a citation to a book on the Mormons by Catholic scholar Thomas O'Dea (which, unfortunately, does not discuss the handcart experience in any depth). I think we've covered the available literature pretty thoroughly, though most of the historians who've dealt with this story have come from within the Mormon community.</p>
<p>Are there any specific paragraphs or sentences that you think too strongly reflect a Mormon POV? We've tried to be neutral, but sometimes it is difficult to see one's own biases. I think the section on legacy must inevitably focus on the handcart pioneers role within Mormon culture, since the handcart experience is largely forgotten outside the Mormon community. When you think we've adequately dealt with your concerns, I'd appreciate receiving your support for the candidacy.</p>

<p>It may still not qualify, but last time, it was deleted as 'NN' we had not been listed in the Lonely Planet Guide to Micronations, we hadn't been mentioned in the Austrailian newspaper, and didn't have the listing with the Northwest Florida Daily News.</p>

<p>Hello. I noticed that you removed the speedy deletion tag from the image. The image isn't used to illustrate the object in question, which in this case is the map itself. Furthermore, maps do not fall into the category of fair use. In this occasion, the map can be reproduced as free, to provide the same information, which is the states of the Balkan League. This is the way it is being used in the two articles; the parts of the image which present photos of the leaders aren't commented under the thumbnails' descriptions.</p>
<p>The PD status isn't verified: the author's date of death is uknown. In my research for the image I wasn't able to find it.</p>
<p>There is also another matter to concern. User <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacedonia_a375.html" title="User:Macedonia">Macedonia</a>, the uploader of the image, acted in bad faith, stating that the image is his: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Balkankingdoms.jpg&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=59534459" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Balkankingdoms.jpg&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=59534459" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Balkankingdoms.jpg&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=59534459</a>. The image could have been tagged for speedy deletion for that reason. I didn't prefer to do that and instead researched its status. Generally speaking, this uploader hasn't very good behaviour when it comes to copyright tagging of images.</p>
<p>For all the reason above, I decided to retag the image with db-reason. If you still object though, place {{<a href="../../../h/a/n/Template%7EHangon_38a0.html" title="Template:Hangon">hangon</a>}} on top of the image's page and explain why it should be kept, by answering at the image's talk page, to the matters I stated above. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDead3y3_5da7.html" title="User:Dead3y3">Dead3y3</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDead3y3_897c.html" title="User talk:Dead3y3">Talk page</a></sup> 08:16, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

It's a good idea, merging several similar policies into one. However, people are trying to insert a clause that weakens the requirements for sourcing on popular culture topics. It would allow self-published fan sites and the like when these are the "best" sources available. At any rate, I've seen you argue against FACs on these grounds, so I thought you might want to check it out. — <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 11:33, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

My Discordina episkopos nature couldn't resist the opportunity of Jaking, and the '300 KB...' line was just TOO GOOD not to bank on... <a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus_23_32e5.html" title="User:Icarus 23">Icarus 23</a> 08:31, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>My idea of polling people on what they want with the bow-tie articles hasn't exactly worked perfectly. I don't see much of a consensus for moving the list to one page or the other, so I'm going to try this: I'll cut down the list on the <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bow_tie.html" title="Bow tie">Bow tie</a> main page to a summary and make sure everything is on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_bow_tie_wearers.html" title="List of bow tie wearers">List of bow tie wearers</a> page sometime late this week unless I hear a strong objection from those, like you, who have suggested otherwise. I think (hope) that's an acceptable resolution.

<p>Sir, in the Chola template, Vijayanagar has been mentioned as a succeeding state. But this is not accurate. Strictly, the Hoysala, Kakatiya and Pandya are the preceeding states of Vijayanagar Empire. A small Chola chiefdom ruled a tiny part of Tamil country as a feudatory of the Hoysala at times and a feudatory of Pandyas at other times through out the 13th century, before the whole of South India was enveloped by Vijayanagar empire. Also the "unknown " preceeding state is not so unknown. Prior to the rise of the Medeival chola, the <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rashtrakuta.html" title="Rashtrakuta">Rashtrakuta</a> king <a href="../../../k/r/i/Krishna_III_88a5.html" title="Krishna III">Krishna III</a> had taken control of portions of Tamil Nadu (nothern) in the 939 – 967 C.E time frame.</p>

<dd>Hi Andrew, the <a href="../../../c/h/o/Chola_dynasty.html" title="Chola dynasty">Chola dynasty</a> article deals with three distict periods of Chola history: the early cholas who rule from around 100 BCE until c.200CE, the interregnum period during which they were in decline and the Imperial Chola period during the height of their power. The preceding state for the early Cholas is unknown. Hence the strictly speaking Rashtrakutas were not the preceding state in this context.</dd>

<p>I had a look at your comments - tried to add a third lead paragraph without making the summary of the legal case and its aftermath not be overly long in the 2nd paragraph. The note about Hasbro's website could get moved back somewhere. Also, the spin-off games were in there already, but I rearranged two paragraphs to try to make that section flow a bit more chronologically.

Recently, I took some patrolling actions at WP to check image copyright issues, then I found an image here: <span class="plainlinksneverexpand lx"><a href="../../../v/a/n/Image%7EVancouver_ib.jpg_5239.html" title="Image:Vancouver ib.jpg">Image:Vancouver_ib.jpg</a> <tt>(</tt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../v/a/n/Image%7EVancouver_ib.jpg_5239.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../v/a/n/Image%7EVancouver_ib.jpg_5239.html" rel="nofollow">edit</a><tt>|</tt>talk<tt>|</tt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../v/a/n/Image%7EVancouver_ib.jpg_5239.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../v/a/n/Image%7EVancouver_ib.jpg_5239.html" rel="nofollow">history</a><tt>|</tt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_%7EImage%7EVancouver_ib.jpg_3cb9.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_%7EImage%7EVancouver_ib.jpg_3cb9.html" rel="nofollow">links</a><tt>|</tt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../v/a/n/Image%7EVancouver_ib.jpg_5239.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../v/a/n/Image%7EVancouver_ib.jpg_5239.html" rel="nofollow">watch</a><tt>|</tt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">logs</a><tt>)</tt></span>. I tried to check the source, but it goes to a login window. I created an account at Flickr, checked the link again, but the image is not shown, because it is private. Thus, I tagged the image with no source. Then, if you read the history of the image page, it was reverted back and forth. I asked the uploader nicely with suggestions from the template, put questions in the talk page, but boom I got a warning there in the talk page. (S)He says that I did some counter-intuitive measures and I should not asked anything about old images, especially from him/her, because (s)he is an admin at Commons.</p>
<p>Now, my action was purely a good faith, just to clean up WP from coyright issues. Did I do something wrong? Or did I do too aggressively? Please suggest me if I did, then I'll slow down my action. Thanks in advance.

<dd>Hi Andrew, I was wondering if you had a chance to go back and look over the article. I revised the section that you objected to and per your comments and those on the Military History Peer Review I changed the name to <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_brat_%28U.S._subculture%29_cecf.html" title="Military brat (U.S. subculture)">Military brat (U.S. subculture)</a>. I think that is a more accurate title because to write a global article on brats would be like writing a global article on "Jews" or "Christians" or any other group that can be found throughout the world. If you could re-review the article it would be great. I'd love to have your support.<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalloonman_3871.html" title="User:Balloonman">Balloonman</a> 16:48, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The changes someone had made to the wordings (especially the double-parentheses sentence) made the plot summaries longer, more awkward, and more confusing. There is no reason to mention a "hot shot" and then define what that term means, when we can just as well use the definition alone. Within the context of the season, it's a small enough plot point that it doesn't merit such special attention. The punctuation in the David Simon quote should absolutely not have been changed, since that's how he wrote it. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 23:35, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed about the Simon quote; that was my mistake. The only wikilinks to "burner" or "hotshot" are disambiguation links; that's why I defined them in the article, which I agree, was awkward.. They don't even exist on Wiktionary; so unless I can link the terms properly, I'll abide by your edit and leave them out of the article. I was just trying to add a bit of the slang used in the show; I'm sort of a slang/jargon junkie. Maybe I should do some more research, and see if I can find news articles about how the show has actually affected slang outside of Baltimore, which is sort of amazing. Oh, and if I may say; your barnstar for your work on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wire_%28TV_series%29_9a73.html" title="The Wire (TV series)">The Wire</a> article was WELL deserved.

<p>Dear Andrew—you may be interested in putting your name to, or at least commenting on <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia_talk%7EManual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29_9d65.html#A_new_parallel_syntax_for_autoformatting_dates" title="Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)">this new push</a> to get the developers to create a parallel syntax that separates autoformatting and linking functions. IMV, it would go a long way towards fixing the untidy blueing of trivial chronological items, and would probably calm the nastiness between the anti- and pro-linking factions in the project. The proposal is to retain the existing function, to reduce the risk of objection from pro-linkers, and to keep the issue simple. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony1_9951.html" title="User:Tony1">Tony</a> 05:43, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Andrew, I need some advice on a speedy deletion here. The article above was created by a sockpuppet, yet we have admin involvement from <a href="../../../c/e/y/User%7ECeyockey_fb55.html" title="User:Ceyockey">user:Ceyockey</a>, who keeps removing the G5 tag - this article was created by a known sock puppet. See the history on the article. Ceyockey's argument is that it's in AfD, and therefore should ride out accordingly; my argument (and at least one other) is that it should go through G5 since we can confirm by pattern that this is a sock of a banned user. I'm deferring another G5 for now, but can I get an independent take on this? --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 19:12, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
