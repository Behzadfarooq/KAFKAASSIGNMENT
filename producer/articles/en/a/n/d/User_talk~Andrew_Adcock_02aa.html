<p>Photon Propulsion</p>
<p>In my presentation I will talk about photon propulsion, the speed of photon propulsion. And other main topics about photon propulsion in this presentation I will not include my designs as they can be stolen and my designs are not copyrighted. The first thing I will talk about is what photon propulsion is. Photon propulsion is the use of light (photon) to propel some thing (propulsion). At the moment N.A.S.A and most space agencies use solid rocket fuel or liquid fuel. Both of these fuels are dangerous and expensive to use that’s why I personally think photon propulsion would be a better choice to use. These are the main points why photon propulsion would be a better option. · Photon propulsion is cheaper and safer to use as there are no high explosive gases or liquids used · Photon propulsion is a faster way of travel · A photon propulsion unit can last for a large amount of time as it runs on electricity. Electricity can come from solar panels, which last a long period of time before being replaced. · Easy to construct primary rocket including photon propulsion unit · Technology already exists These are some of the main reasons photon propulsion would be a better option. I worked out threw my private studies that my photon propulsion unit could bring a rocket up to speeds of 294000km/s I worked this out by using a simple equation (W=N+L=Sp=A=Dt) this is weight = nothing + light = speed = acceleration = distance travelled simplified. So by using this we could harness the whole power of the light as the weight = nothing. But there was one problem with this if we were to use today technology we would lose two percent of the lights power. If you are wondering why the problem is that the most reflective material is only 98% reflective. So now you have to take 2% from 300000km/s, which equals 294000km/s so you lose 6000km/s. so I believe by using photon propulsion the space age would be forever changed as you could get a rocket to mars within 6 weeks and a rocket to Pluto within 2 years. Also I believe you could travel to and from planets with ease and more safely and the shuttles them selves will have more room as the propulsion system is fairly small compared to today’s propulsions systems on the shuttles. Also astronomy would take off as we could travel further in less time so we could travel to desired destination and study planets and stars more intensely and fin out more secrets of the universe. We could only take full advantage of photon propulsion in space as there is no gravity and it is a vacuum also there would not be any force acting against the rocket in space except for thrust.<br /></p>
<p>So as you can see all the force is going into push. Also it shows there are no forces acting against the rocket. So all the force are focused on one point of the rocket. Now I will talk about the costs of such a project.<br />
I have estimated the cost of the primary rocket to be less than £5000000<br /></p>
<pre>
    These costs would cover:<br />
</pre>
<p>· Body shell that is made of titanium, aluminium and foam<br />
· The photon propulsion unit<br />
· Technology inside the rocket this includes camera, electronics and battery storage<br />
· Four webbing solar panels · Four satellites (for booster reception power)<br />
· Oxygen canister for braking and steering<br /></p>
<p>These are the things the money would by but this fee does not include the fee to put the rocket into space this would be a shuttle job. Also as you can tell this price for this rocket is extremely cheap compared to most rockets and to most space research programs for an example the Americans mars program 1 rover equalled £100000000 mines a snip or a cost compared to that. Also mine rocket and space travel and technology would benefit because if u attached a rover to 1 of my rockets instead of it taking 6 months to get to mars I could get there within 6 weeks with a payload. Now I will talk about the actual rocket it self. The rocket shell will consist of five lairs the outer lair witch is made up of titanium and a tiny bit of glass at the top of the rocket, which is both together 3mm thick. The second lair is made up of compacted foam, which is 6 mm thick. Then the third lair is made up of aluminium 2mm thick. The fourth lair is just compacted foam again with a thickness of 4mm and the final lair is aluminium again which is 2mm thick. So the actual shell is 17mm thick this provides plenty of protection. Inside the rocket there will be two battery storages, electronics for the rocket and the running of it, a camera for astronomy reasons and a compressed oxygen tank for braking and steering reasons. On the outside of the rocket there would be 4 satellite dishes 4 webbing solar panels these are all that are on the outside of the shell. Both of these objects would open up to save on space use while on the space shuttle. And of course the main object the photon propulsion unit the heart of the rocket it self. Now I will talk about the object inside and outside the rocket itself. Firstly I will talk about the camera. The camera itself will be for imagine the surroundings when the rocket is in space. The camera will be at the front of the rocket. Now I will focus on the oxygen canister. The oxygen canister will do the task of braking and steering the rocket it will only have a limited supply of oxygen just enough to break and turn the rocket around and send it back to earth. Also the oxygen canister will play the role of second booster just I case the other one breaks down. Now I will focus on the solar panels. The solar panels will be like a cross web they will not be solid as this takes up needed space. The solar panels will keep the batteries full most of the time, which in turn power the photon propulsion unit. There will be four solar panels with a webbing design.<br /></p>
<p><br />
With this the design the solar cells themselves will be flexible so they can fit into a smaller space on ether end of the solar cells there will be to bars holding the solar cell they will be the only ridded things on the solar panels. Now I will focus on the satellite communication. For satellite communication I will use four satellites to boost the power of the transmitter also I would not use radio waves as they travel to slow I would ever use light waves or cosmic waves as they travel fast. But there is not much need for the communications as I would set a certain course and then pre-program the rocket to do it with out the help of humans. The communication is just there to make sure the rocket works as planned. Now I will focus on the battery storage. The battery storage is the most important part of the rocket except the photon propulsion unit as the battery storage will power the photon propulsion system it self. There will be two batteries on board the rocket. This is because while one is working on producing the power for the photon propulsion drive one of the batteries can charge and via versa. The batteries will have a medium voltage for example 24v and a high amp. When a battery starts running low the batteries will swap over and the battery that has been charging up will take over and run the photon propulsion system. Now I will focus on the actual photon propulsion system. The photon propulsion unit is used to propel the rocket. The photon propulsion unit works by bouncing a light beam into the rocket then by bouncing that light beam out I have shown this on the diagram below. The diagram shows an arrow hitting a flat plate this flat plate resembles the rocket. And the arrow resembles the light beam.<br /></p>
<pre>
the actual light beams and light producing system will all be in cased. I will not include any designs for the photon propulsion unit, as they are not copy righted so they could be copied or stolen. But the photon propulsion has been checked over by an engineer to see if the designs are capable to be made. And with my sums I think the photon propulsion unit should work im positive. Any way that that’s the end of my presentation I will include all my sums, equation and my designs so you can have a look over them. The designs will be drawn and annotated on graph paper.<br />

Equations and sums pages<br /></p>
<p>These are the sums and equation I use to base this presentation on.<br />
Talking about if the rocket was in space<br />
Weight is determined by gravity<br />
W=N+L=Sp=A=Dt<br />
Weight = Nothing + Light = Speed = Acceleration = Distance travelled<br />
Mass is always the same<br />
Light travels at 300000000m/s<br />
Force push&gt; Force Against = Acceleration<br />
Action Reaction<br />
Flash of light Thrust (acceleration)<br />
So light travels at 300000000m/s and the most reflective material is only 98 percent reflective. So you lose two percent of the lights power so you can only reach a maximum speed of<br />
300000000/100=3000000<br />
3000000 * 98 = 294000000<br />
So you can only go a maximum speed of 294000000m/s using photon propulsion with today technology.<br /></p>
<p>Here are the sums and equations I used to base this presentation on all these sums have been toughly check and answered properly. If you find something wrong with this data please tell me I will be happy to listen and correct wrong data.<br /></p>
