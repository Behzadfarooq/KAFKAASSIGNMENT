<p>Hi. I am interested the situation or place you found the sign because I think it is pretty rare to find that kind of sign in Japan, especially with Russian. Would you add more information to your photo? I really appreciate it. Jjok 05:42, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A tag has been placed on Pathogen (band), requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article seems to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">(see the guidelines for notability here)</a>. If you can indicate why the subject of this article is notable, you may contest the tagging. To do this, please add <code>{{<a href="../../../h/a/n/Template%7EHangon_38a0.html" title="Template:Hangon">hangon</a>}}</code> on the top of the page and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position.

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Winniecooper.JPG</b>. I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a> but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. When you use a generic fair use tag such as {{fair use}} or {{fair use in|article name}}, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use.</p>
<p>Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a <a href="../../../i/m/a/Help%7EImage_page_09d1.html#Fair_use_rationale" title="Help:Image page">fair use rationale</a>.</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too.

Note that any fair use images lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html#Images.2FMedia" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">criteria for speedy deletion</a>.

<ol>
<li>Go to the image description page and edit it to add <code>{{Replaceable fair use disputed}}</code>, <b>without deleting the original Replaceable fair use template</b>.</li>
