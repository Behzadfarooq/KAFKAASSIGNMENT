<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndylkl_Sandbox2_a50b.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>For most of the 19th century the criminal law which was applied in the three Straits Settlement of Singapore, Penang and Malacca was that of England, in so far as local circumstances were permitted. There was little doubt that English <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_law.html" title="Common law">common law</a> crimes were recognised in these territories at the time. Certain problems, such as the application of certain Indian Acts, however, arose in 1871 and the Straits Settlements Penal Code was passed. It came into operation on 16 September 1872. The Code is practically a re-enactment of the Indian Penal Code.</p>
<p>The original Code, as amended on numerous occasions, presently states the law of Singapore. The most recent amendment was made by the Penal Code (Amendment) Act 1984 which came into effect on 31 August 1984. The effect of this amendment was that minimum penalties were provided for certain offences. The last major amendment of the Code prior to 1984 took place in 1973 when punishments for certain offences were enhanced.</p>
<p>Prior to 1870 the law relating to Criminal Procedure in force in Singapore was mainly found in the Indian Act XVI of 1852. As a consequence of the passing of the Straits Settlements Penal Code in 1871, the Criminal Procedure Ordinance V of 1870 was passed which replaced the Criminal Procedure Act XVI of 1852 but continued the English system of Criminal Procedure and made it applicable to the Penal Code. This was found impracticable as the Penal Code did away with the division of crimes into felonies and misdemeanours and the Criminal Procedure Ordinance VI of 1873 was passed accordingly. The Ordinance VI of 1873 marked the passage of the English Criminal Law in favour of the Indian. The Ordinance did away with indictments and instituted charges for all criminal offences; it abolished the Grand Jury and Special and Common Juries.</p>
<p>A new Code of Criminal Procedure was enacted in 1902. The present Code was passed by the Legislative Council on 28 January 1955. It repeals and re-enacts with the amendments the previous Code. All offences under the Penal Code are inquired into and tried according to the Criminal Procedure Code.

<p>An American teenager, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_P._Fay_54d3.html" title="Michael P. Fay">Michael Fay</a>, aroused passionate media interest from the United States after he was caught vandalising Singaporean cars in 1994. There was a formal request by the American government not to carry out the sentence, which was caning. Former prime minister <a href="../../../l/e/e/Lee_Kuan_Yew_c963.html" title="Lee Kuan Yew">Lee Kuan Yew</a> called American practices "soft" and denied the appeal, although the number of strokes given was lessened. Fay was caned and interest in the incident has fallen since.</p>
<p>Soon after the Michael Fay issue,</p>
<p>in 2004, Chief Justice Yong Pung How sentenced a 25-year-old former policeman, Annis Abdullah, to jail for 12 months for receiving oral sex from a teenage girl. In his statement he said that despite growing permissiveness in some countries there were "certain offences that are so repulsive in Asian culture".</p>

<p>In recent years, the Singaporean government has relaxed some of the stricter laws. For example, <a href="../../../b/u/n/Bungy_jumping.html" title="Bungy jumping">bungy jumping</a> is no longer illegal. Film censorship has also been relaxed. There are also signs that the government is considering relaxing a number of laws concerning sex.</p>
<p>It is of note that while some archaic laws do remain from British common law, the judicary usually does not deliberately enforce these laws. For instance, while possession of pornography is illegal, no known checks have been made. However,</p>

<p>There are however inconsistencies in the political and legal frameworks in Singapore. Homosexuality and homosexual acts remain illegal but there are signs that the Singaporean government is trying to shed this stance and indeed, gay parties are beginning to be organised with the discreet approval of the government. These parties are now advertised throughout SouthEast Asia and attract a large audience.</p>
