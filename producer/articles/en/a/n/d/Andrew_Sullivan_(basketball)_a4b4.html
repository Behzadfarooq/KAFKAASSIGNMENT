<p>The only child of Eunice Sullivan, Andrew moved from his London home to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a> where he attended Saint Augustine Prep school, in <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turnersville.html" title="Turnersville">Turnersville</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_5ac9.html" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a>. In his prep career he scored 1,368 points, averaging 19.8 PPG as a senior. Coached by Paul Rodio his team had a 24-6 record and he was named in the first team all-state as well as being voted as South Jersey Player of the Year <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Sullivan_%28basketball%29_a4b4.html" title="Edit section: College years">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">College years</span></h3>
<p>In 1999, Andrew enrolled in the School of Arts &amp; Sciences at <a href="../../../v/i/l/Villanova_University_d98e.html" title="Villanova University">Villanova University</a>, home of the Wildcats basketball team where he graduated in 2003. The gifted athlete was Villanova’s most versatile defender and could guard four positions. The <a href="../../../p/o/i/Point_forward.html" title="Point forward">point forward</a> (Can play both <a href="../../../p/o/i/Point_guard.html" title="Point guard">Point guard</a> and more predominantly <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_forward.html" title="Power forward">power forward</a>) is able to run the floor well and his long arms and quick feet make him a strong rebounder.</p>
<p>Sullivan took to his first season with the Wildcats in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>-<a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>, on his debut chipping in with three rebounds and tough defense in seven minutes against <a href="../../../l/a/f/Lafayette.html" title="Lafayette">Lafayette</a>, and later the freshman converted his first career points with a 3-point shot from the top of the key in the first half against <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fairleigh_Dickinson_8b1d.html" title="Fairleigh Dickinson">Fairleigh Dickinson</a>. He tied a career high with seven points in 12 minutes in 67-66 loss to <a href="../../../m/i/a/Miami_University_faf2.html" title="Miami University">Miami</a> on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_17.html" title="January 17">January 17</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> and three days later grabbed five rebounds and scored five points in 66-57 win at <a href="../../../p/r/o/Providence_College_ebe2.html" title="Providence College">Providence</a>. Overall it was a successful rookie season for the Englishman, in which another highlight unfolded when he made several spectacular plays in 86-69 win over <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Notre_Dame_aca9.html" title="University of Notre Dame">Notre Dame</a>, ending the night with seven points and five rebounds in 14 minutes of activity. By the end of the season, Sullivan had played 29 games, averaging 2.31 PPG.</p>
<p>His second season saw his minutes fluctuate throughout the campaign, playing just 20 games and averaging a mere 1.65 PPG, although he did earn a career-high 26 minutes, playing with energy and strong defense in an 87-75 win over <a href="../../../t/o/w/Towson_University_c401.html" title="Towson University">Townson</a> on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_26.html" title="November 26">November 26</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> he contributed four points and five rebounds. Returning from injury, Andrew also scored another four points in 23 minutes of activity in 74-60 win over <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Connecticut_3a36.html" title="University of Connecticut">Connecticut</a> on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_10.html" title="February 10">February 10</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>.</p>
<p>The following season would prove to be much more successful than the previous when he established himself as Villanova’s best perimeter defensive player in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>-<a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">02</a>. He was the only Wildcat to start all 32 contests and connected on .529 of his field goal attempts, chalking up a 5.65 PPG average, or a combined total of 181 points throughout the season.</p>
<p>Sullivan started the season well, when he contributed six points and six rebounds in 59-57 win over <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Dayton_a80f.html" title="University of Dayton">Dayton</a> on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_24.html" title="November 24">November 24</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>. His key steal on Dayton’s last offensive possession gave the Wildcats a chance to win on a final trip down the floor and his 28 minutes established a new career high as did his point total. Three days later Andrew better his minutes record, logging a career high 39 minutes in a 61-58 overtime loss against <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Salle_University_8f89.html" title="La Salle University">La Salle University</a>.</p>
<p>Later that season Andrew came within a whisker of his first career double-double, with nine points and nine rebounds in a 71-59 loss at <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Pittsburgh_9287.html" title="University of Pittsburgh">University of Pittsburgh</a> on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_2.html" title="February 2">February 2</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> and a week later helped hold <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Kapono_01bc.html" title="Jason Kapono">Jason Kapono</a> to nine points on 3-of-9 shooting in 58-57 Villanova victory over <a href="../../../u/c/l/UCLA_052f.html" title="UCLA">UCLA</a>. Sullivan's season finished in a 72-70 loss to <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Connecticut_3a36.html" title="University of Connecticut">Connecticut</a> in <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_East_627e.html" title="Big East">Big East Tournament</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_7.html" title="March 7">March 7</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> where he produced nine rebounds and four points.</p>

<p>After leaving <a href="../../../v/i/l/Villanova.html" title="Villanova">Villanova</a> in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, Sullivan travelled to the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> to sign a professional contract with leading Dutch club Eiffel Towers from the city of <a href="../../../n/i/j/Nijmegen.html" title="Nijmegen">Nijmegen</a>. After just one season in Holland, Andrew returned to his homeland and immediately signed for leading <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Basketball_League_c0b6.html" title="British Basketball League">British Basketball League</a> team the <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newcastle_Eagles_7525.html" title="Newcastle Eagles">Newcastle Eagles</a> in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>. Despite being pipped to the league title by just 2 points, "Sulli's" season was incredibly successful. Not only did he help his win the Championship Play-offs in a 78-75 win over the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chester_Jets_202b.html" title="Chester Jets">Chester Jets</a>, but he was also the game high scorer with 27 points and was named as the MVP of the Championship.</p>
<p>Following an incredible debut season in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, the future was looking bright for the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> talent, and despite receiving several offers to play on the <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">European</a> continent, Andrew opted to stay with the Eagles for another season, resigning for <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Basketball_League_2005-06_a44f.html" title="British Basketball League 2005-06">2005-06</a>, and it paid handsomely.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newcastle_Eagles_7525.html" title="Newcastle Eagles">Newcastle Eagles</a> dominated the regular season, and conquered every tournament they participated in. First claiming the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Basketball_League_c0b6.html#BBL_Trophy" title="British Basketball League">BBL Trophy</a> with a 71-50 win over the <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leicester_Riders_995c.html" title="Leicester Riders">Leicester Riders</a>, Sullivan himself contributing with a game high 18 points, as well as 11 rebounds, 4 assists and 3 steals, which earned him the MVP award. The Eagles doubled their success with an 83-69 victory in the final of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Basketball_League_c0b6.html#BBL_Cup" title="British Basketball League">BBL Cup</a> against <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Towers_ad89.html" title="London Towers">London Towers</a>, with another 18 points, and also 2 block shots coming from the <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_forward.html" title="Power forward">power forward</a>.</p>
<p>After capturing the League title, Newcastle then went on to win the Championship Play-Offs to complete the "clean sweep" of trophies. Sullivan scored 19 points in the final, an 83-68 win against the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Rocks_c33c.html" title="Scottish Rocks">Scottish Rocks</a> at <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham.html" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>'s <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Indoor_Arena_07d4.html" title="National Indoor Arena">National Indoor Arena</a>. To complete his unbeleivably victorious season, Andrew was also named as the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Basketball_League_c0b6.html" title="British Basketball League">BBL</a> Player of the Year <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Basketball_League_2005-06_a44f.html" title="British Basketball League 2005-06">2006</a>.</p>
<p>With every title won in just two years in England, seemingly Sullivan's work there was done and a fresh challenge was sought after. <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> came calling again and this time, he jumped at the chance of playing with European <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball.html" title="Basketball">basketball</a>'s elite in the <a href="../../../e/u/r/Euroleague.html" title="Euroleague">Euroleague</a>. In the summer of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, he signed for <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spanish</a> <a href="../../../a/s/o/Asociaci%C3%B3n_de_Clubs_de_Baloncesto_0e3f.html" title="Asociación de Clubs de Baloncesto">ACB</a> club <a href="../../../j/o/v/Joventut_Badalona_e5ab.html" title="Joventut Badalona">Joventut Badalona</a>, where he joined fellow <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">Brits</a> <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Archibald_ef4a.html" title="Robert Archibald">Robert Archibald</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Richard_Betts_adeb.html" title="Andrew Richard Betts">Andy Betts</a>.</p>

<p>Sullivan's successes have not just restricted to his club teams, but continued with the <a href="../../../e/n/g/England_national_basketball_team.html" title="England national basketball team">England national team</a> competing at the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Commonwealth_Games_e6e9.html" title="2006 Commonwealth Games">2006 Commonwealth Games</a> in <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne.html" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>. A 80-57 victory against <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigeria.html" title="Nigeria">Nigeria</a> in the third place game, in which Sullivan did not play, awarded England the Bronze medal and the team returned home triumphant. In the four games that he did feature, Sullivan averaged 31 minutes-per-game, 5 rebounds-per-game and 18.25 points-per-game, with his tournament high coming against <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a> where he scored 23 points in a 95-53 win.</p>
