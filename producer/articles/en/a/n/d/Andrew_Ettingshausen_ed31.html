<p>Ettingshausen began his rugby league career playing for his local club side at the age of six, though he first began to make inroads while playing for his school side De La Salle where he was subsequently scouted and signed as a junior to the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Cronulla-Sutherland_Sharks_aee6.html" title="Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks">Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks</a>. It didn't take long however for him to make his mark at the club, while he was still at school in his last year as an eighteen year old he made his first grade debut for the club.</p>
<p><a name="Cronulla-Sutherland_Sharks" id="Cronulla-Sutherland_Sharks"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Ettingshausen_ed31.html" title="Edit section: Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks</span></h2>
<p>Andrew Ettingshausen made his first grade debut for the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Cronulla-Sutherland_Sharks_aee6.html" title="Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks">Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks</a> in round 5 of the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a> season against the <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newtown_Jets_d7e4.html" title="Newtown Jets">Newtown Jets</a> at fullback, his debut was somewhat of an uneventful affair although he did cross for a try in the second half; his second match was no improvement as he had a poor game and was substituted at half time to then be dropped the following week to reserve grade. For the next few years his career continued to be somewhat of a series of ups and downs scoring a total of six tries over his first two seasons before being sidelined for a considerable amount of time in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a> following a foot injury meaning he would spend yet again further time in reserve grade.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a> season marked the first season where Ettingshausen started to stamp his mark on the NRL and rugby league in general; he scored a total of ten tries from the wing in his third season and cemented his spot in the Sharks squad.</p>
<p>For the next half a decade Ettingshausen's reputation continued to grow in rugby circles amongst fans and coaches alike, scoring 69 tries in the next six seasons as well as being selected for both <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_South_Wales_238d.html" title="New South Wales">New South Wales</a> and Australia. The <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a> season was his high point in the early years when he was moved off the wing and into the centres where he would remain for the rest of his career. He went on to score seventeen tries that season including crossing the line five times in one match against the <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illawarra_Steelers_c321.html" title="Illawarra Steelers">Illawarra Steelers</a> setting a record for most tries in a game, he then went on to make his debut for the Australian side after impressing national selectors throughout the season.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a> seasons were somewhat quiet ones for Ettingshausen whom continued to battle injury through large periods, including missing the early parts of the 1993 season after contracting <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaria.html" title="Malaria">malaria</a> on a fishing trip to <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papua_New_Guinea_eb0d.html" title="Papua New Guinea">Papua New Guinea</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a> saw ET back at his best, seeing him score a total of eighteen tries and subsequently bringing his tally to over one hundred for the club and leading the Sharks by example after also being awarded the captaincy of the Sharks.</p>
<p>Ettingshausen continued to be the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marquee.html" title="Marquee">marquee</a> player both for the Cronulla club topping the Sharks scoring lists from the 1994 to 1996 seasons as well as becoming the face of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Rugby_League_51b9.html" title="National Rugby League">National Rugby League</a> competition often heading marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>ET further succumbed to injury midway into the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a> season, hampering his chances at playing for the Sharks and threatening to prematurely end his rugby career. Andrew battled back from injury to play for another two seasons of first grade before his back problem was diagnosed as being <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chronic_%28medicine%29.html" title="Chronic (medicine)">chronic</a> in the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> season and he played his final game for the against the <a href="../../../a/u/c/Auckland_Warriors_0734.html" title="Auckland Warriors">Auckland Warriors</a> that year.</p>
<p>He ended up playing a total of 328 <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Rugby_League_51b9.html" title="National Rugby League">NRL</a> games, all for Cronulla which became the record for the most games for a single club, and 4th highest overall, behind <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terry_Lamb_d386.html" title="Terry Lamb">Terry Lamb</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brad_Fittler_42b4.html" title="Brad Fittler">Brad Fittler</a> and <a href="../../../c/l/i/Cliff_Lyons_cede.html" title="Cliff Lyons">Cliff Lyons</a>.</p>

Cochrane had taken a photo of Ettingshausen while he was in the shower undressed on the Australian 1990 tour of Great Britain. The magazine ran the shot in 1991. without his permission. ET successfully sued the magazine for originally $350,000 which was then reduced to $100,000 after appeal.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the 1986 off-season, Ettingshausen signed a one year deal with <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_Football_League_e235.html" title="Rugby Football League">English rugby league</a> club <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leeds_Rhinos_719e.html" title="Leeds Rhinos">Leeds</a>. Originally to gain further first grade experience and confidence he impressed his adopted English club so much they expressed an interest in him to re-join them again when he could.</p>
<p>The following season, Ettingshausen decided to act on the previous seasons interest from Leeds and yet again moved overseas in the Australian off-season. During the beginning stages of the season ET voiced his desire to move from off the wing and into the centres a move that would pay dividends and on returning home to Cronulla, Ettingshausen played in the centre position for the rest of his career.</p>

<p>Ettingshausen made his New South Wales <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_League_State_of_Origin_ca8b.html" title="Rugby League State of Origin">State of Origin</a> debut in the 1987 season and over the next nine years went on to bring his tally of State of Origin games to twenty-seven. This stands in 2nd place for most appearances for NSW (behind <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brad_Fittler_42b4.html" title="Brad Fittler">Brad Fittler</a>) and in 5th place overall for the most appearances. He made his debut on the wing but went on to cover both the position of fullback and centre scoring a total of nine tries.</p>

<p>In 1992 the Cronulla club extended their ground at <a href="../../../t/o/y/Toyota_Park_%28Cronulla%29_883c.html" title="Toyota Park (Cronulla)">Endeavor Field</a>, adding a new stand to the ground at a cost of 2.5 million dollars<a href="http://www.4eva.com/media/1/833.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.4eva.com/media/1/833.jpg" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. The club originally calling the stand the 'Western Endeavour' grandstand but with the retirement of Andrew Ettingshausen in 2000 the club decided to name it the 'Andrew Ettingshausen' stand in his honour.</p>
