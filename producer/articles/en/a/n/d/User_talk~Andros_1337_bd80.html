<li>If you need <a href="../../../h/e/l/Wikipedia%7EHelp_0ce0.html" title="Wikipedia:Help">help</a>, post a question at the <a href="../../../h/e/l/Wikipedia%7EHelp_desk_5342.html" title="Wikipedia:Help desk">Help Desk</a> or ask me on <a href="../../../j/r/d/User_talk%7EJrdioko_1b04.html" title="User talk:Jrdioko">my talk page</a>.</li>

<p>P.S. One last helpful hint. To sign your posts like I did above (on <a href="../../../t/u/t/Wikipedia%7ETutorial_%28Talk_pages%29_d48f.html" title="Wikipedia:Tutorial (Talk pages)">talk pages</a>, for example) use the '~' symbol. To insert just your name, type ~~~ (3 tildes), or, to insert your name and timestamp, use ~~~~ (4 tildes).</p>
<hr />
<p>Thanks for fixing the table background on the various <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronic_music.html" title="Electronic music">electronic music</a> genres. Out of curiosity, what browser are you using? "lightgray" works fine for me in Galeon/Mozilla. Also, you might want to outline a rationale/policy for choosing background colors on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Music_genres_e8db.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Music genres">Wikipedia:WikiProject Music genres</a> so that when new genres are added, we have guidelines. Since this a rather large change, it should be discussed in a central place and the WikiProject(s) is the place to do it.

<p>I'm curious—why did you replace {{jazzfooter}} with an inlined table on <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cool_jazz.html" title="Cool jazz">Cool jazz</a>? The only difference seems to be the color of the table. <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla"></a> — <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla">Gwalla</a> | <a href="../../../g/w/a/User_talk%7EGwalla_1816.html" title="User talk:Gwalla">Talk</a> 23:33, 18 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, please change the <a href="../../../j/a/z/Template%7EJazzfooter_1b2a.html" title="Template:Jazzfooter">Template:Jazzfooter</a>! don't include markup inline, otherwise it has to be changed in multiple places. In general please <b>discuss</b> such changes on the relevant Talk pages particular <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Music_genres_f88a.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Music genres">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Music genres</a>. --<a href="../../../l/e/x/User%7ELexor_1be7.html" title="User:Lexor">Lexor</a>|<a href="../../../l/e/x/User_talk%7ELexor_6dd0.html" title="User talk:Lexor">Talk</a> 01:47, 19 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not sure what you mean by this statement (as seen in <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delta_Air_Lines_1541.html" title="Delta Air Lines">Delta Air Lines</a>). Can you clarify what "smartly organized" means? I would think that <a href="../../../r/y/a/Ryanair.html" title="Ryanair">Ryanair</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southwest_Airlines_2156.html" title="Southwest Airlines">Southwest Airlines</a> beat Continental and Delta hands down when it comes to organizing their fleet. - <a href="../../../s/e/k/User%7ESekicho_869d.html" title="User:Sekicho">Sekicho</a> 23:01, Nov 4, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I mean out of the world's major airlines. It means that the fleet is well planned out and are not so diverse. Also, I said that Delta and Continental are <b>some of the most smartly organized fleets</b>, not the absolutely best organized. For example, Northwest operates a fleet of Boeings, Airbuses, and McDonnell Douglases (DC-9 and DC-10, of which went out of production long before the acquisition by Boeing). The MD-80 and MD-90 were still produced after the acquisition. I wouldn't consider Northwest's fleet very smartly organized.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, Delta's MD-90s are possibly on the chopping block for retirement. They were originally Delta's 727 replacements, but the 737-800 proved to be a better aircraft for them. Their fate depends on Delta's financial condition. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndros_1337_b575.html" title="User:Andros 1337">Andros 1337</a> 23:58, 4 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>For that matter, "smartly organized" isn't a <i>clear</i> opinion. When I read it, it sounds like you're saying that Delta and Continental have more intelligent people selecting their airplanes (I'm American, so maybe you've been taught a different sense of "smart"). Whatever the intent of the phrase is, it's still not something that should be in an encyclopedia. All the stuff you said above, though, would be great in the articles... - <a href="../../../s/e/k/User%7ESekicho_869d.html" title="User:Sekicho">Sekicho</a> 00:44, Nov 5, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've reverted your edit- the standard here is for a console to be listed as part of an era if it's still on sale during that era (hence why the NES/SNES are in so many different eras). <a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESockatume_ba19.html" title="User:Sockatume">Sockatume</a> 22:27, 27 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>i don't give a goddamn what you think they are. they're not monsters, they're villains. they DO NOT DESERVE THEIR OWN PAGE IN THE WIKIPEDIA. that is why i placed them on the list of villains. you made an edit -- a REVERT -- without putting a note on my talk page. that's just plain rude. if you do not come up with some solution that involves them not having TWO IDENTICAL COPIES OF THE SAME WORTHLESS PAGE (incl merge node), i will revert them to the way i had them before. i have been as polite as i could possibly be in this instance.

<p>In the defnition of a signature attack, a signature attack has NOTHING to do with the Pokémon's last attack learned. At times, a Pokémon's signature attack can even be a TM, HM, or tutored move.

<p>I know that logic tells you that the leader should be listed first, and what not, but the order in several of the articles follows any sort of numeric order seen as part of the outfits or the morphing sequence.

<p>Why would you need a citation to verify the fact that the Gillig Phantom is one of the longest-running transit models? It's common industry knowledge.</p>
<p>Kitsap Transit in Bremerton, WA still runs some early 1983 models, Mason Transit Authority in Shelton, WA still runs some 1992 and 1993 models, and Intercity Transit in Olympia, Washington still operates a fleet of some 20 or so 1989 models.</p>
<p>Gillig builds the sturdiest bus possible, and many of their buses (even some of their 35-40 year old school buses still in existance) are still on the road some 20 or so years after they left the factory.</p>
<p>I've followed the history of the Gillig Corporation since I was very young and have a vast archive of information relating to the company and their buses. <a href="../../../s/r/o/User%7ESrosenow_98_52c0.html" title="User:Srosenow 98">Srosenow 98</a> 07:10, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>At BusTalk.net, the Gillig Phantom is widely regarded as a lighter-duty bus than many of its competitors, such as the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Flyer_6cc2.html" title="New Flyer">New Flyer</a> D40HF, the <a href="../../../o/r/i/Orion_Bus_Industries_2fac.html" title="Orion Bus Industries">Orion</a> V, and the <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neoplan_AN440_a396.html" title="Neoplan AN440">Neoplan AN440</a>. The Gillig Advantage, however, is considered to be heavier-duty than the Phantom. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndros_1337_b575.html" title="User:Andros 1337">Andros 1337</a> 18:24, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I find that to be odd, since the Gillig Corporation has always advertised the Phantom as a heavy-duty bus platform. I have in fact a brochure from 1982 announcing the arrival of the Phantom and it advertised it as the "next generation" heavy duty transit bus. It is widely regarded as being a heavy duty bus for most transit agencies in Washington State, several fleets of which exclusively run the Phantom. The following quotes are in fact taken from their own website, at the Phantom product page and the Products list page:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"A heavy duty, high floor transit bus that set the standard for reliability, durability and value when it was introduced in the early 1980’s"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Phantom, a standard floor height heavy-duty transit bus, first introduced in the early 1980's and still used today. Called a fleet workhorse, it has built a reputation of reliability, durability, and value. Of course today it incorporates the latest technologies and many product improvements."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Since the Phantom was nothing more than a rebodied school bus (the front roofcap, roof curve, and windshield elements share similarities with the previous roundbody school bus design from 1967-1982), it already had a legacy of heavy-duty service behind it when it was introduced. Several dozen Gillig school buses are still on the road in Washington State, and in California, some 30 years after they left the factory. And there are some 23-year-old Phantoms still in daily service in some portions of Washington State alone.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The Phantom's overall design has also remain largely unchanged since its 1982 debut, making it one of the longest-running transit bus models to date alone. Not to sound like a sales rep for Gillig (for which I'm not), but Gillig does not, and has never under any circumstances built a light-duty vehicle in their 100+ year history. That I do know from my years of research into the company and the products in which they've built. <a href="../../../s/r/o/User%7ESrosenow_98_52c0.html" title="User:Srosenow 98">Srosenow 98</a> 09:30, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was just thinking we should use the officially used colors instead of simple X11 color names. That way, we wouldn't have to worry about having to make up colors (I don't remember Dragon Pokémon <i>ever</i> being referred to as orange; it's always been a dark teal color). The hex triplets of the colors as used in the games have been listed <a href="../../../p/o/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EPok%C3%A9mon_Collaborative_Project_0eb9.html#Concept_for_types" title="Wikipedia talk:Pokémon Collaborative Project">in the PCP's talk page</a>, in case you didn't know. I just thought it'd be nice to use the real colors used in the games (a soft, orange color instead of bright red for Fire). --<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandon_Dilbeck_91d8.html" title="User:Brandon Dilbeck">Brandon Dilbeck</a> 16:56, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>However, those colors are not universally applied. The TCG uses a different color scheme from the 3G games, and even Pokemon Stadium used a different scheme. In most media, Fire is usually associated with red, plus that the color association of the classical element of Fire is traditionally red. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndros_1337_b575.html" title="User:Andros 1337">Andros 1337</a> 18:40, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The trading card game only deals with 9 types (right?), so it doesn't even deal with all of them, or account for the types that aren't in the game. (What color would Bug be if it were in the card game? Green's already taken by Grass.) Maybe we could post this conflict on the <a href="../../../p/o/k/Wikipedia%7EPok%C3%A9mon_Collaborative_Project_77a9.html" title="Wikipedia:Pokémon Collaborative Project">Pokémon Collaborative Project</a>'s talk page and see what other Pokémon fans say (and some might not even like this idea of adding templates).

<p>Hello.. Sorry for the delayed response, but we've been without electricity up here in the Northwest. I think my rationale for calling the MD-90 the RJ of its day is that in general the initial DC-9 family of planes was generally for 100 seat, short haul markets. I admit I misremember the seat count of the MD-90 (I believe I was thinking of the MD-95/717, which for the most part is a DC-9 replacement) DC-9s and the larger RJ's (E190 etc) play in the same 100 seat, 1-2 hour market.) Also if you take a peek at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=McDonnell_Douglas_MD-80/MD-90&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=93708522" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=McDonnell_Douglas_MD-80/MD-90&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=93708522" rel="nofollow">edit summary</a>, I was removing an unsubstantiated criticism that the MD-90 was not successful due to its lack of transcontinental ability, I did not put that MD-90s were the RJ's of their day into the article, just the edit summary.

<p>I recall you asked me about what model the 35 new ABQ RIDE buses would be. Well, I talked to Greg Payne (the transit director) today, and he confirmed that they were New Flyer models. The reason why the article said Gillig before was that ABQ RIDE was going to do a "piggyback order" with another transit agency where they order the same model of buses. However Greg Payne didn't like the idea of a piggyback deal, so he made a specific order for the 40-foot New Flyer buses.</p>
<p>Anyway, hope that clears that up.&#160;:) <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerryPlanet_61fc.html" title="User:PerryPlanet">PerryPlanet</a> 23:46, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was at the meeting for the next Rapid Ride route today, and got the same answer. Thanks anyway. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndros_1337_b575.html" title="User:Andros 1337">Andros 1337</a> 23:58, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you for adding the oneworld colors to all the tables in the airlines page. I have stuck to this idea with the <a href="../../../s/k/y/SkyTeam_c5df.html" title="SkyTeam">SkyTeam</a> carriers, and I have tried to do this before, but many people have reverted my edits.--<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolich17_4d55.html" title="User:Golich17">Golich17</a> 00:25, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry about that...I'm a huge aviation enthusiast so I know that. I must have accidentally reverted it.</p>
