<p>Hi Ande B., thanks for the comment. It would be fine for Wikipedia to use an original translation as long as the copyright holder grants permission for use under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Free_Documentation_License" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Free_Documentation_License" rel="nofollow">GFDL</a>. If I do the translation, I'm the copyright holder, and I would grant permission. See <a href="../../../c/o/p/WP%7ECopyrights_5026.html" title="WP:Copyrights">WP:Copyrights</a> for details.</p>
<p>It's also possible that copyrighted translations could be included in the article under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use" rel="nofollow">fair use</a> provisions of copyright law, but Wikipedia discourages this.</p>
<p>Now, I'm not claiming that my translation would have much poetic quality to it--I tend to generate very clunky-sounding prosy translations. But at least I don't use "thee" and "thy," nor do I use odd rhyme schemes.</p>

<p>Ande,</p>
<p>Thank you for your polite response to my changes. Myth is a link to a <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disambiguation.html" title="Disambiguation">disambiguation</a> page and there is an effort to consolidate links so that they point to direct pages. If you search for <a href="../../../m/y/t/Myth.html" title="Myth">myth</a> on Wikipeidia, this page has several derivations. If you feel any of these specific links within "myth" would work better for the pages you reference, please feel free to change them. However, please refrain from linking towards simply <a href="../../../m/y/t/Myth.html" title="Myth">myth</a> in line with Disambiguation_pages.

<p>I hate pestering people's talk pages about AFD votes (or votes at all... it's <i>very</i> bad form really) but I've just done a huge amount of work on this article, and it is probably 80% different from when you voted. I have found a large number of English language references, and I have used &lt;cite&gt; so any reader or editor can identify where each individual statement in the article came from. That ought to deal with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. As for notability, you can make your own decision: <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28books%29_a736.html#Note_on_notability_criteria" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (books)">the relevant guideline</a> says "Usually, books with an ISBN-number and/or availability in a couple dozen of libraries and/or a Project Gutenberg type website, and with a notability above that of an average cookbook or programmers manual would qualify". Which doesn't help really, since it's entirely subjective how you are going to compare notability of a best-selling paranoid gutter-press fantasy to a cookbook! If you rank this as below an average cookbook, I'm not going to argue with you&#160;:) <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrappler_4371.html" title="User:TheGrappler">TheGrappler</a> 04:12, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Cheers! I was about to vote delete myself, but the name rang a bell - then I realised I'd actually seen this book causing a fuss in the press, which was a sign it was probably pretty notable. German language books don't tend to get a huge amount of press coverage unless they have caused a fairly notable row! Of course, once WP's conspiracy theorists smell out this page it will probably degrade in quality pretty soon, but I've tried to make it all cited at the moment, which ought to help it last (at least there'd be something to revert back to, if needs be...) <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrappler_4371.html" title="User:TheGrappler">TheGrappler</a> 05:36, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Joema, how unfortunate that we must resort to this. But I see no alternative to the constant tagging of the article. I will give what support I can.

<p>If you notice about my page, it one of a kind. Have you encountered an user page that transgress wikiplatforms as seamlessly and conviently as mine? Also you may see that they (other user) put thier comment on the wrong page that I devote for comments, so normally I copy and paste them in thier appropriate page. And I put the disclaimer in the beginning, I do not want unnessary comments or frivalous comments either. However I will keep your comment, since it of interest, however I still stand on this ground, If this was a wikipage on an article I would understand, however this is an Userpage, thus in my opinion I see myself as the administrator to my user page. Also how many user comment page have you seen with a disclaimer on it, if this is the first then leave me alone. You might want to reread that page again in specific <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Talk_page#Etiquette" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Talk_page#Etiquette" rel="nofollow">etiquette</a> and tell me where it say it not prohibited; remember those are just suggestions, not rules. FYI you are the first to ever mention this since I have been on wikipedia for about a year now, and I think it unwarranted. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul.Paquette_f4ed.html" title="User:Paul.Paquette">Paul.Paquette</a></p>

<dd>Yes, I'm familiar with this notion but have not read about it much in a very long time. I try to use my own experience and skills to make useful contributions to the Wikipedia. I don't know how well I succeed. I try to limit my substantive contributions to areas in which I have some expertise. Those would include molecular biology, intellectual property law, ancient civilizations and editing / journalism. Since my time and physical abilities are limited, I try to stick to the things I know I can handle. Usually that means making small but useful edits for grammar, spelling, NPOV, article organization, and sentence structure. Writing an article from scratch is a different (and more strenuous) business altogether, but we all benefit by having a team of proof-readers and copy editors. I write enough original stuff for my real-life work to satisfy my professional interests in writing. So far, I haven't seen a gap in the Wikipedia that would inspire me to write a new article. Still, I appreciate the amount of effort it takes to produce a single page of fresh text. Writing well takes effort. Finding useful information and organizing it also takes a lot of effort. Some people search for and remove spam all day long. This is an esential activity, even though most readers will never even know that those efforts were taken. Everyone's efforts are important. (Except for those who vandalize the pages!) I apologize if you believe I have insulted you or singled you out for some malign purpose.

<p>"Try doing a Google search of melanin and Polygenic Inheritance. Skin color is controlled by more than one gene. Melanin itself comes in different forms and colors. Some melanin tends to be distributed in the cytoplasm and some tends to prefer to be nearer or within the nucleus. This affects its apparent intensity. All of this can add up to unexpected results. It's been a few years since my last genetics calss, though, so pick up a genetics text for an accurate and complete answer. Ande B 03:45, 31 March 2006 (UTC)"</p>

<p>I am not sure what you are looking for exactly, but the first thing that came to mind was the book of Douglas Futuyma "Evolution" (2005. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, Massachusettes), which is often used teatching and offers a healthy and solid introduction to the topic.

<p>Hello Ande. Sorry to read about your relapse, i hope you are now feeling better. You are very welcome for my comments of support. They were not inspired by partisan loyalties, however. I am genuinely affronted by the apparent lack of logic and perspective displayed the arbitrator who has been proposing these 'findings of fact'. Its mindboggling.</p>
<p>It really makes me doubt the integrity of the project when an individual who has been selected for their ability to interpret policy, appears more interested balancing the outcome than challenging the real cause of the dispute. The '25% conceded to critics' comment is, frankly, laughable. Sometimes it makes you question the point of contributing. Anyway, i've said more than enough about the subject now. I guess i'll just wait to see what the other arbitrators say. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket">Rockpocket</a> <a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERockpocket_62af.html" title="User talk:Rockpocket">(talk)</a> 06:16, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b><a href="../../../c/h/r/Chromatophore.html" title="Chromatophore">So far so good</a></b>, but i'm now at the point where i've made the current article as comprehensive as i can, technically speaking, but need some opinion on how to improve accessability, context and language for the intelligent layperson, or any general comments on how to improve it. I requested a <a href="../../../p/e/e/Wikipedia%7EPeer_review_Chromatophore_358a.html" title="Wikipedia:Peer review/Chromatophore">peer review</a> to this end, but there appear to be no takers. So i have directly asked a few scientist/editors for their opinion instead. With your interest in biomedical subjects, and your background in technical writing, i'd really value any criticism you could give me. If you are unable to, i of course understand. Should you be up to it, please feel free to edit the article yourself, of course. Alternatively, i would be happy to implement anything you think would be an improvement.

<p>Hi Ande. I just thought i'd drop a short note in support, and to counsel wiki-calmness. I know exactly how you feel as i have gone extactly the same cycle of support, exasperation, frustration, irritation and with regards to Cesar. I had already spent a fair amount of time interacting with him on <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-psychiatry.html" title="Anti-psychiatry">Anti-psychiatry</a>, so you may now appreciate why i was keen to get a guidance from ArbCom on him as well as Ombudsman. Anyway, i really think the more he says on ArbCom the more likely it is that they will move to restrict his editing, he really is digging his own grave here. <b><a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket"><font color="green">Rockpock</font></a><font color="blue">e</font><a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERockpocket_62af.html" title="User talk:Rockpocket"><font color="green">t</font></a></b> 18:50, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Ande, Funny you should bring that up, I recently added a section to the article on Lesbianism which included a short discussion of the Greeks and the Arabs. You probably noticed it, and that whole section could be brought over and expanded. At the present time I do not have much else on file, but now that I know you are working on that article I will bring in any tidbits I come across.

<p>Hello Ande. Thanks for your email reply, i thought i'd reply on-Wiki as my email is so disorganised that, humiliating as it is to admit, i can keep track of my communications better here. I completely agree with your sentiments. I too am making a concerted effort to leave the pointless debate behind, and focus on the reason i joined the community in the first place - to edit.</p>
<p>I'm also very grateful for your contributions to the chromatophore article and am glad you enjoyed it, i finally took the plunge and nominated it for Featured Article status. So far, so good - it has generated some support and no objections yet - but it still has some way to go before it gets promoted. I would recommend you tackle <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kinesin.html" title="Kinesin">kinesin</a>, i found it both tremendously satisfying and informative to revist past interests. I'd be more than happy to pitch in with any help i could provide. <b><a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket"><font color="green">Rockpock</font></a><font color="black">e</font><a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERockpocket_62af.html" title="User talk:Rockpocket"><font color="green">t</font></a></b> 01:00, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
