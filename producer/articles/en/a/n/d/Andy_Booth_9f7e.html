<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Booth_9f7e.html" title="Edit section: The Early Years">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Early Years</span></h4>
<p>"Boothy", as he quickly became known, was born in <a href="../../../h/u/d/Huddersfield.html" title="Huddersfield">Huddersfield</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>. He began his career playing for his home town club as a trainee, making his first team debut as a substitute at Fulham in March 1992, but had to wait until November that year to score his first goal (in a 2-2 draw at Blackpool) for the club. A few more goals followed in the 1992/3 season, but it was the season after, the last at <a href="../../../h/u/d/Huddersfield_Town_2218.html" title="Huddersfield Town">Huddersfield Town</a>'s <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leeds_Road_40a8.html" title="Leeds Road">Leeds Road</a> ground, that he really forced his way into the first team, scoring 10 goals in his 26 appearances.</p>
<p>The next season was probably the best of Booth's career. Partnered with maverick red-head <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronnie_Jepson_13f2.html" title="Ronnie Jepson">Ronnie Jepson</a>, Booth netted 29 goals, of which six came in two <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hat-trick.html" title="Hat-trick">hat-tricks</a>, and finished the season by scoring one more in the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Football_League_a245.html#The_Play-Offs" title="The Football League">play-offs</a>, guiding the Terriers to promotion into Division One. The next season, in which Huddersfield finished just outside the playoff spots in the division above proved to be the last Booth would play for Huddersfield after four seasons, during which he had scored 53 league goals for the club.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Booth_9f7e.html" title="Edit section: The Premiership">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Premiership</span></h4>
<p>In the summer of 1996, <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheffield_Wednesday_F.C._681d.html" title="Sheffield Wednesday F.C.">Sheffield Wednesday</a> bought Booth for a then club record transfer, £2.7 million , and his goal-scoring form continued into the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Premiership_cce4.html" title="The Premiership">Premiership</a>, scoring 13 goals for the Owls in his first season making him the club's highest goal scorer for that season. Although Booth is not the tallest player, exactly six feet tall, he has always been known for his aerial ability and a good many of the goals he has scored have been with his head. Perhaps it was this, allied with the cartilage operation that kept him out for two months during the next season that proved pivotal in his career. He scored only seven goals - indeed, Booth was never to reach double figures in the Premiership again, although there were thrilling highlights, none better than the hat-trick he scored on <a href="http://www.4thegame.com/matchcentre/premiership/reports/75952/swfcbwfc.html" class="external text" title="http://www.4thegame.com/matchcentre/premiership/reports/75952/swfcbwfc.html" rel="nofollow">his return to the team</a> (following the operation) against <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolton_Wanderers_F.C._f176.html" title="Bolton Wanderers F.C.">Bolton</a>.</p>
<p>Booth stayed with <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheffield_Wednesday_F.C._681d.html" title="Sheffield Wednesday F.C.">Wednesday</a> until 2001, a period which included their relegation from the top flight. It was during his final season with the Owls that he made his final Premiership appearances, during a successful loan spell with <a href="../../../t/o/t/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C._6bd2.html" title="Tottenham Hotspur F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> and his Wednesday career came to an end shortly after his return to <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hillsborough_Stadium_e114.html" title="Hillsborough Stadium">Hillsborough</a>. Tottenham tried to sign him on a permanent deal but he opted to return home to his beloved Huddersfield Town</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Booth_9f7e.html" title="Edit section: The Prodigal Son">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Prodigal Son</span></h4>
<p>In March 2001, Huddersfield Town were struggling towards the bottom of Division 1. On March 22nd, they paid <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheffield_Wednesday_F.C._681d.html" title="Sheffield Wednesday F.C.">Sheffield Wednesday</a> £200,000 for the services of Booth, who returned with the intention of scoring the goals that would help him avoid his second successive relegation, and keep the club he had supported as a boy in the division he helped them reach. He failed.</p>
<p>In his first full season back with the club, he helped them into the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Football_League_a245.html#The_Play-Offs" title="The Football League">play-offs</a>. Despite another goal for Booth, Huddersfield lost to <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brentford_F.C._c8f6.html" title="Brentford F.C.">Brentford</a> and were denied the opportunity to bounce straight back. Worse was to follow next season, when Booth's six goals did little to help his team avoid relegation, and they fell into the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_League_Two_10d2.html" title="Football League Two">bottom division</a> for the first time since <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a>.</p>
<p><a name="The_Legend" id="The_Legend"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Booth_9f7e.html" title="Edit section: The Legend">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Legend</span></h4>
<p>Despite this setback, Booth stayed with <a href="../../../h/u/d/Huddersfield_Town_F.C._a572.html" title="Huddersfield Town F.C.">Huddersfield</a> and his experienced head was crucial in guiding a team of youngsters through a difficult season, culminating in a drop into the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Football_League_a245.html#The_Play-Offs" title="The Football League">play-offs</a> on the last day of the season. This time, though, <a href="../../../h/u/d/Huddersfield_Town_F.C._a572.html" title="Huddersfield Town F.C.">Huddersfield</a> were victorious, and their fans at the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Millennium_Stadium_2510.html" title="Millennium Stadium">Millennium Stadium</a> in <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardiff.html" title="Cardiff">Cardiff</a> could proclaim a new legend - Andy Booth.</p>
<p>Now plying their trade in <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_League_One_a28d.html" title="Football League One">Coca Cola League One</a>, Huddersfield have been in the upper reaches of that league since their return. Booth has scored 23 goals in that period, including his 100th league goal for the club (after which a DVD was released showing all 100 goals) and a <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hat-trick.html" title="Hat-trick">hat-trick</a>, all headers, on 18th March 2006 against <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotherham_United_F.C._a421.html" title="Rotherham United F.C.">Rotherham United</a>.</p>
<p>At the end of the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005-06_in_English_football_281f.html" title="2005-06 in English football">2005-06 season</a>, following another <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Football_League_a245.html#The_Play-Offs" title="The Football League">play-off</a> appearance (defeat against <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barnsley_F.C._591f.html" title="Barnsley F.C.">Barnsley</a> over two legs), Booth had scored 122 goals for <a href="../../../h/u/d/Huddersfield_Town_F.C._a572.html" title="Huddersfield Town F.C.">Huddersfield Town</a>, leaving him 37 short of the club's record scorer, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Brown_%28footballer%29_2b49.html" title="George Brown (footballer)">George Brown</a>.</p>
<p>To commemorate Booth's service to the club, Town played a <a href="../../../t/e/s/Testimonial_match.html" title="Testimonial match">testimonial match</a> against <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spanish</a> <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Liga_874d.html" title="La Liga">La Liga</a> side <a href="../../../r/e/a/Real_Sociedad_18ce.html" title="Real Sociedad">Real Sociedad</a> on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_25.html" title="July 25">July 25</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>.
