<p>The best thing to do in these situations is to ask your system administrator why Wikipedia has been blocked, or ask a teacher.

<p>Tarkovsky, Boxing is my favorite past time and I really appreciate tthat you turned the jumbled mess of a boxing article into something worth reading Andman8</p>
<p>Thanks but it really has been a collective effort by many generous Wikipedia contributors; I'm just a small part of it, chipping away at the loose ends here and there. Hopefully more boxers/writers will help us write the article as the year's end approaches and boxing gyms start closing for the Christmas holidays&#160;:) <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarkovsky_615a.html" title="User:Tarkovsky">Tarkovsky</a></p>

<p>Hey, i am going to be gone for the summer. I wrote the vast majority of the cinco article 6-8 or whatever months ago under a variety of IP addresses. Anyways, what is really lacking is pics-- Can you go to cinco with a digi cam and get some relevant photos of the stuff discussed on the cinco page? I'll get back to work on the article in the fall. You're doing a heckuva job &lt;brownie&gt;!! (tmbrtmbr june 28 06)</p>

So this may indicate the beginning of another campaign to remove most High School articles. Your opinion on the AfD article would be appreciated. It might be helpful if a notability standard for High Schools could be agreed upon.

<p>Thanks for showing me this article! I was really impressed by it and have congratulated the author! I left some feedback in the small handful of places I thought it was a little dodgy, but there was very little of it.</p>
<p>What's so good at it?</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Fantastic structure</b> - reads like an encyclopedia article. Not like an argument; not like a pro vs con discussion; but like a description of the school. The article handled controversies - pretty serious ones, in fact - without looking like the article itself was a battleground. Kudos to the editor.</li>
<li><b>Exceptional referencing</b> - aside from one small slip, which I've left a note to the editor about, this really is top class stuff. Although not 100% (unfortunately there was weakness in the academic decathlon section) it was as good as most things on <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a> are. What was so good about it? Essentially, the article was a description that consisted of a series of facts. Virtually all of these facts had an attached reference. When you look at the reference, what you find is not just something related to the fact in question, not just a related anecdote, but a reliable source (some very strong, authoritative, ones in fact! See <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>) that didn't just vaguely back up the point in question but <i>asserted <b>exactly</b> the fact they had been called on to reference</i>. Fantastic stuff! I was seriously impressed.</li>
<li><b>Sense of scale</b> - editorial judgment was very strong. Only notable, verifiable facts were presented; a "cruft-free" article. No anecdotes, just encyclopedia-worthy facts and descriptions. On the other hand, almost everything worth putting in an encyclopedia was in there. More information about results would be good, and that'd be a matter brought up at <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a>, but <a href="../../../g/a/n/WP%7EGAN_e8d4.html" title="WP:GAN">WP:GAN</a> is more about making sure that an article is <i>fairly</i> comprehensive, and what is there is well-sourced, well-written, and in line with policies and guidelines.</li>
<li><b>Good editorial practice</b> - not only were the contents of this article carefully selected, they were presented well too. For instance, this was a weasel word (<a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7EWEASEL_bba5.html" title="WP:WEASEL">WP:WEASEL</a>) free zone. If it said "X claimed Y", then there was always a reference in which X actually claimed Y. Great! No "some people thought Y", or "Y was claimed". There were logical sections. If any seemed underdeveloped it was because they were developed to the point that good secondary sourcing would allow, and went no further (with the exception of a sentence more than there should have been in "academic decathlon"; although the sentence itself was reporting a verifiable and notable event, it should have been referenced). Self-references (<a href="../../../s/e/l/WP%7ESELF_e41e.html" title="WP:SELF">WP:SELF</a>) were avoided.</li>
</ul>
<p>I got the impression that the editor knew how to be brutal. There are times to wield an axe, for instance, if you really can't find a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> to <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> that says specifically that your info is true, then your info just isn't <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. There must have been things they wanted to recount, some tales to tell, but it didn't make it in to the final article. This editor swung that axe, and without doing collateral damage to the encyclopedic-worthy content either. So, personally, I was impressed; if I was reviewing that article now for <a href="../../../g/a/n/WP%7EGAN_e8d4.html" title="WP:GAN">WP:GAN</a> I'd have stuck it on hold for 7 days and asked the editor to put in an additional reliable source that exactly backed up the claims in the academic decathlon section, and to think seriously about whether personal names deserved mention (are they <i>that</i> notable or important). If they could in good conscience tell me that (1) they thought the names really were important enough to put in, and (2) they are included in a secondary source anyway, so it's already public information, then I'd say it was within their editorial discretion. I'd also ask them if they might be interested in putting in some inspection report information or recent academic results, but that wouldn't be absolutely necessary to pass as a good article. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrappler_4371.html" title="User:TheGrappler">TheGrappler</a> 14:48, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Your'e doing a really great job sorting all of the film articles, very gallant of you, but when you assess, you have to use a capital letter. For example:</p>
<p>{{FilmsWikiProject|class=start}}</p>
<p>is what you're doing. This is fine, and the little banner comes up and all, but it actually doesn't sort the article for some reason. They stay in the unassessed category. What you've got to do, to properly sort it, is this:</p>
<p>{{FilmsWikiProject|class=Start}}</p>
<p>See the capital on Start? That makes all the difference. Because what I've had to do, is follow you around, adding a capital to all the articles that youve assessed. It's no real problem, but, if you could, from now on, when you sort, use the capital, it would be a great help. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThefourdotelipsis_84ca.html" title="User:Thefourdotelipsis">....</a><sub>(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThefourdotelipsis_3386.html" title="User talk:Thefourdotelipsis">Complain</a>)</sub><sup>(<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Thefourdotelipsis_2e81.html" title="Special:Contributions/Thefourdotelipsis">Let us to it pell-mell</a>)</sup> 02:04, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey, I'm not sure I fully understand the assessment process for 1.0, and I thought you might be able to clear it up for me. Who exactly does the assessments? Some of your comments in the... 'lively' discussion on WikiProject Films seem to suggest that anyone can do an assessment. Is this true? Because if it is, the assessments seem relatively meaningless. I did a lot of work on the episode articles for the TV series <i><a href="../../../c/l/o/Clone_High_6053.html" title="Clone High">Clone High</a></i>, so could I just decide that they're A-Class Top level importance articles?

<dd>Anyone can do an assessment. If you feel the article is up to the grades that the guidelines suggest, rate the article. The only thing is articles GA, A, and FA, have to go through the official channels. A-Class should be "a group" of editors and contributer from the project to promote them within.

<dd>I understand that the process isn't exactly useless. Like I know that most of Wikipedia is entirely equal - almost anyone can make any edit they want almost anywhere. It's just that my experience with article rating consists of the more formal forms of review: GA, FA, RfC, and peer review. With all of those, the process is more formalised than anywhere else on Wikipedia, and that's (I believe) what gives their ratings the strength they have. FAs have such high status because of the strenuous, horrifically critical review process they have to undergo to be called such. That's all I was saying. But don't get me wrong: I do think these reviews are definitely useful. Any kind of feedback from anyone can only help an article, and the more feedback the better. It's just a different process than I've seen before.--<a href="../../../g/p/o/User%7EGpollock_68c4.html" title="User:Gpollock">Gpollock</a> 20:47, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey there. I like the idea of the WP songs template. I'd be happy to help get these on existing talk pages, but as far as the rating system goes - is there a good way to know how to rate them?

<p>Hi, Andman8. Thanks for the note and the compliment. I'll try putting that tag in the talk pages to film articles I've started. I'm a little unclear on how to judge them though. Most are obviously stubs, but is their any sort of guide-line to help separate a "stub" from a "start," and then on to the other ratings? The "importance" rating could be fairly subjective also... Not to mention the personal attachment the author may have to the subject (naturally I feel it's important if I created the article), an article like <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arirang_%281926_film%29.html" title="Arirang (1926 film)">Arirang (1926 film)</a> is probably of pretty low importance to the average American Wiki-user, or general (non-Korean) film-buff, but of very high importance to those interested in Korean cinema. Anyway, I'll look around at other articles to get a feel, and start adding them to old articles and new articles as I create them. Thanks again. <a href="../../../r/i/z/User%7ERizzleboffin_0ecb.html" title="User:Rizzleboffin">Rizzleboffin</a> 16:04, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the link &amp; advice. I'm still not quite sure about the 'importance' ratings though-- the judging seems very subjective to me, and also very relative. <i><a href="../../../a/n/g/Angora_Love_fa3f.html" title="Angora Love">Angora Love</a></i> may be of no importance at all relative to human history, low importance in history of cinema, but (I think) mid-importance, or notability, in L&amp;H's career... and possibly high-importance relative to their silent films, since it is their last...</dd>
<dd>Also, I have a fear that someone's going to come along behind me and recommend for deletion every article I've labeled of 'low' importance, even though I feel an article on something as relatively obscure <i>Angora Love</i> is certainly apropriate for an online encyclopedia, which doesn't have the space-limitations that a print encyclopedia has. Anyway, I've put the template on all my film talk pages. <a href="../../../r/i/z/User%7ERizzleboffin_0ecb.html" title="User:Rizzleboffin">Rizzleboffin</a> 22:56, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ah! Now, I get it! This is template is for Wikiproject Films, and there are other templates for other subjects, and could potentially be one for L&amp;H specifically... Now it all makes sense! I'm still learning the ropes here, still picking up new details on how the Wiki-project works every day. And I agree-- there's nothing more fun than learning and contributing to the knowledge-base.

<p>I see that someone added a new paragraph to the KISD controversies about a proposed KISD amusement park. Is that true?? Also the grammar is very bad but wanted to wait until it was verified before cleaning it up. --<a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClaygate_5630.html" title="User:Claygate">Claygate</a> 22:37, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for fixing it - I thought it was BS or there would have been something in the media or net about it. I think they're barely keeping up with the portable buildings, much less financing an amusement park. --<a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClaygate_5630.html" title="User:Claygate">Claygate</a> 02:14, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have been a member of WikiProject Films for some time now, and I have been devoting most of my time recently to adding films to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_films.html" title="Lists of films">Lists of films</a> and adding the WikiProject Films template to films I come across. I was wondering if I should continue to add this template to the talk pages, since it appears a new one has been created. Let me know if I should continue to add it. On the project page is a template that states 11,000 pages have the template but 84% of films don't. Do you know how 84% of films don't? Is there a master list of films on Wikipedia? The reason I ask is that I would like to continue to add the template and then use the master list (if it exists) to add multiple films to the Lists of Films page. Please respond on my user page, and if you don't know the answers to my many questions, can you please direct me to someone who might know? Thanks. --<a href="../../../n/e/h/User%7ENehrams2020_121d.html" title="User:Nehrams2020">Nehrams2020</a> 04:13, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Me again. I see that you are working on assessing the films from <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVersion_1.0_Editorial_Team_Film_articles_by_quality_65b1.html" title="Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Film articles by quality">Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Film articles by quality</a>. As of right now, I am taking these films and transfering them to <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_films.html" title="Lists of films">Lists of films</a> (by letter) since the list is pretty empty compared to the number of films out there. I don't plan on assessing films for the higher classes as that will take too much time for me. I would like to assist a little in the assessment, but I have a few questions. Do I just add the assessment for stub, future class, etc. to the {{<a href="../../../f/i/l/Template%7EFilmsWikiProject_01d5.html" title="Template:FilmsWikiProject">FilmsWikiProject</a>}} and that's it? Or do I need to move the film I graded to another page? Is it automatically moved by MathBot, or is it done by the user? Again, I would probably only be grading films as either stubs or future class. Please tell me the basic step-by-step process so I can assist the project as I take part in my own project. Thanks for the help. --<a href="../../../n/e/h/User%7ENehrams2020_121d.html" title="User:Nehrams2020">Nehrams2020</a> 08:42, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Uh - A lot of schools and organizations forbid using Wikipedia as a scholastic resource. Have you ever tried citing Wikipedia as a source in a university essay? Universities won't let you use Wikipedia because Wikipedia doesn't have quality control that other sources have.

<p>In the description at Image:Antiwikipropagandainenglishclass.jpg, you state: "Under United States law if you can give a good reason why something should be copied this is definitely one of them. The source material is not copyrighted so it goes to the public domain." This is unclear: the first sentence indicates that the scanned handout is fair use, whereas the second says it's in the public domain. Neither of these agree with the GFDL tag you provided. There are a number of possibilities regarding the copyright status of the image:</p>
<ol>
<li>The handout came from a university that releases all its publications into the public domain.</li>
<li>The handout came from a grade school, and the school board is part of a municipal, provincial or state government that releases all its publications into the public domain.</li>
<li>The teacher who wrote the handout agreed to release it into the public domain or under a copyleft license. (Note that the lack of a copyright notice is not a relinquishment of copyright under modern law.)</li>
<li>None of the above conditions apply, and Wikipedia must claim the image as fair use.</li>
</ol>
<p>Which of these is the case? We need to know so that the image can be correctly described and tagged, and a fair use rationale can be written on the image page if necessary. Note that per <i><a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridgeman_v._Corel_9a3e.html" title="Bridgeman v. Corel">Bridgeman v. Corel</a></i>, when something is scanned, it is the copyright holder of the original, and not the person scanning, who holds the copyright. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeonMerlin_5f2b.html" title="User:NeonMerlin"><span style="background-color:#000000;color:#00ff00;text-decoration:underline overline"><span style="color:#ff0000">Neon</span></span></a><a href="../../../n/e/o/User_talk%7ENeonMerlin_f87e.html" title="User talk:NeonMerlin"><span style="background-color:#00ff00;color:#ff0000;text-decoration:underline overline"><span style="color:#000000">Merlin</span></span></a> 05:22, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I assume it was from Cinco Ranch?

<p>Great work so far! I was going to fly by for a copyedit, but I've got a better idea. I've got a bunch of books that cover Lang (and thus, to some degree, <i>M</i>) in some detail. Tell me where--what issue, what topic--you're feeling the article could most use some new juice in and I'll hit my library.—<a href="../../../d/c/g/User%7EDCGeist_4ed5.html" title="User:DCGeist">DCGeist</a> 10:59, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In re <i>M</i>. Sounds good. It look like I won't have the chance till Monday, but I'll be happy to sit down then and see if I can find the info you specify. In re <a href="../../../b/_/m/B_movie.html" title="B movie">B movie</a>: You're undoubtedly right. I've been putting it off just cause I know it's going to be hard work boiling the main article down to a satisfactory summary. I'm pretty clear on what's most crucial early and late, but whenever you have the chance to look over the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, I'd love to hear what you think is the crucial meat that needs to stay in the main article and what's the gravy that can be reserved for the sub.

<dd>OK, I've got the Lang books stacked beside the computer now. My Wikitime the last few days has been spent shepherding <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutual_Broadcasting_System_6892.html" title="Mutual Broadcasting System">Mutual Broadcasting System</a> through FAC. The last sticking point is the article's organization. I went with my usual chronological approach, with headered subsections for specific consideration of programming during each decade of the network's prime. A couple readers weighed in preferring a scheme where the discussions of the business history and the programming are seperated into different sections. If you have the time, would you mind taking a look at it and then going to <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_candidates_Mutual_Broadcasting_System_2c5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Mutual Broadcasting System">Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Mutual Broadcasting System</a> to say which system you think would be superior in this case? Obviously, I went with the approach that struck me as more informative, but I'm happy to follow the consensus, whichever way it points. Thanks much. And I am about to move in on Fritz.

<dd><a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> might help. Most of your examples are not notable I agree. If someone else puts a speedy delete tag on them and I'm the admin reviewing the tags I will probably delete them. In practice things have tightened up in the last year and brand new articles get looked at much more closely. Personally I don't like speedy delete (someone did it to a half written article I'd written on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Way_the_World_is_a8a2.html" title="The Way the World is">The Way the World is</a> once and it really annoyed me. However when the people who tag put a "admin backlog" sign up I go and review them. I am busy tonight but I don't mind trying to help and establish notability one way or another some time. --<a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a> <a href="../../../b/o/z/User_talk%7EBozMo_4fce.html" title="User talk:BozMo">talk</a> 22:00, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>And I have retagged it as spam, which it remains no matter what part of Wikipedia is resides in. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 14:30, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes I spent way too much time editing wikipedia.

<p>Is this supposed to be sarcastic? "Wow I'm sure glad I spent my time in front of a computer screen instead of living life". If you would really like to know I am encountering some difficulties at this moment in time where it is a relief to get away from my family and try to forget my current situation. It helps me take my mind off things, so please don't attack me again. <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font color="blue"><b>♦ Sir Blofeld ♦</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../e/r/n/User_talk%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_b982.html" title="User talk:Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font size="-4"><font color="black"><b>"I've been expecting you"</b></font></font></a></sup> 14:06, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>And don't judge that "it takes a certain type of person". You have no idea who I am and physically do not even slightly resemble a geek.

<p>Hey as you said lifes too short so of course I of course I'm not mad at you. Why would I be? Its just I really don't think life is as wonderful as you think! I think my editing for wikipedia has been fuelled by enthusiasm for the project. And I don't consider it a total waste of time - not only have many people expressed their gratuity for my work but I beleive the project is progressing very well as is something worthwhile. Beleive it or not I used to hate computers and it is only since I got the Internet I have become addicted! I guess maybe I should spend less time on it! <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font color="blue"><b>♦ Sir Blofeld ♦</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../e/r/n/User_talk%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_b982.html" title="User talk:Ernst Stavro Blofeld"><font size="-4"><font color="black"><b>"I've been expecting you"</b></font></font></a></sup> 21:39, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
