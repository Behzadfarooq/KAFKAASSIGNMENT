<p><b>Andreas Fritz Hillgruber</b> (<a href="../../../j/a/n/January_18.html" title="January 18">January 18</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/2/1925.html" title="1925">1925</a>-<a href="../../../m/a/y/May_8.html" title="May 8">May 8</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>) was a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservatism.html" title="Conservatism">conservative</a> <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Germany_9d9b.html" title="West Germany">West German</a> <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historian.html" title="Historian">historian</a>. Hillgruber was born in <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angerburg.html" title="Angerburg">Angerburg</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> (modern <a href="../../../w/e/g/Wegorzewo.html" title="Wegorzewo">Wegorzewo</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a>) near the then East Prussian city of <a href="../../../k/%C3%B6/n/K%C3%B6nigsberg.html" title="Königsberg">Königsberg</a> (modern <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kaliningrad.html" title="Kaliningrad">Kaliningrad</a>, <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a>). His father was a school teacher. Hillgruber served in the <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Army_5d6b.html" title="German Army">German Army</a> in the years <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a> and spent the years <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a> as a <a href="../../../p/o/w/POW_17fa.html" title="POW">POW</a> in <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>. After his release, he studied at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_G%C3%B6ttingen_076d.html" title="University of Göttingen">University of Göttingen</a> where he received a PhD in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1952.html" title="1952">1952</a>. He spent the decade <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954.html" title="1954">1954</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a> working as school teacher. In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960</a>, he married Karin Zieran, with whom he had three children. Hillgruber worked as a professor at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Marburg_bdfd.html" title="University of Marburg">University of Marburg</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a>), <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Freiburg_5122.html" title="University of Freiburg">University of Freiburg</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>) and at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Cologne_2e1b.html" title="University of Cologne">University of Cologne</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>). In the late <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>, he was a target of radical student protesters. He died in <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cologne.html" title="Cologne">Cologne</a> of throat <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cancer.html" title="Cancer">cancer</a>.</p>
<p>Hillgruber's area of expertise was German history from <a href="../../../1/8/7/1871.html" title="1871">1871</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>, especially its <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_history.html" title="Political history">political</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/p/Diplomatic_history.html" title="Diplomatic history">diplomatic</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_history.html" title="Military history">military</a> aspects. He argued for understanding this period as one of continuities. In the early <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a> he still saw <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> as a conventional war, but by <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a> Hillgruber was arguing that the war was for Hitler a vicious, ideological war in which no mercy was to given to one's enemies. In his 1965 book, <i>Hitlers Strategie</i> (<i>Hitler's Strategy</i>), Hillgruber examined the grand strategic decision-making progress in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a> and concluded that while Hitler had to adjust to strategic and operational military realities, whenever possible his decisions were influenced by racist, anti-Semitic beliefs.</p>
<p>Hillgruber’s writings on the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> show certain constancies as well as changes over the years. He always argued that the Soviet Union was a brutal, expansionary, <a href="../../../t/o/t/Totalitarianism.html" title="Totalitarianism">totalitarian</a> power, in many ways similar to <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_Germany_add9.html" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a>. But, on the other hand, he argued that <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moscow.html" title="Moscow">Moscow</a>’s foreign policy was conducted in a way that was rational and realistic, while the foreign policy of <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin.html" title="Berlin">Berlin</a> during the Nazi era was completely irrational and unrealistic. The turning point in Hillgruber’s attitude came in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954.html" title="1954">1954</a> when he was in involved in a celebrated debate with <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerhard_Weinberg_6e47.html" title="Gerhard Weinberg">Gerhard Weinberg</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hans_Rothfels_f689.html" title="Hans Rothfels">Hans Rothfels</a> on the pages of the <i>Vierteljahrshefte für Zeitgeschichte</i>. Together with Hans-Günther Seraphim, Hillgruber had argued that the German invasion of the Soviet Union in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a> had been a “preventive war", forced on Hitler to prevent an imminent Soviet attack on Germany. So effectively did Weinberg and Rothfels demolish Hillgruber’s arguments that he repudiated his previous views. Thereafter, he maintained that <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Barbarossa_47da.html" title="Operation Barbarossa">Operation Barbarossa</a> had been prompted solely by Hitler’s ideological belief in the need to acquire <i><a href="../../../l/e/b/Lebensraum.html" title="Lebensraum">Lebensraum</a></i> (Living Space) in Russia, where a massive German colonization effort was planned and the entire Russian people were to be reduced to slave status. In the 1970s and 1980s, Hillgruber often attacked historians such as <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Irving_2e5a.html" title="David Irving">David Irving</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/k/Viktor_Suvorov_843d.html" title="Viktor Suvorov">Viktor Suvorov</a> for putting forward the same arguments as he had done in 1954. Along the same lines, he criticized the American <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-Nazi_5279.html" title="Neo-Nazi">neo-Nazi</a> historian <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Hoggan_0132.html" title="David Hoggan">David Hoggan</a>, who argued that the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> had provoked <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a>.</p>
<p>Hillgruber was an <a href="../../../f/u/n/Functionalism_versus_intentionalism.html" title="Functionalism versus intentionalism">Intentionist</a> on the origins of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Holocaust_8edb.html" title="The Holocaust">the Holocaust</a> debate, arguing that <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> was the driving force behind the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a>. This set Hillgruber against Functionalist historians such as <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hans_Mommsen_5582.html" title="Hans Mommsen">Hans Mommsen</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Broszat_7dfc.html" title="Martin Broszat">Martin Broszat</a>, whose "revisionist" claims on the origins of the Holocaust Hillgruber found distasteful. Hillgruber was well known for arguing that there was a close connection between Hitler's foreign policy and anti-Semitic policies and that <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler.html" title="Hitler">Hitler</a>'s decision to invade the Soviet Union in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a> was linked to the decision to initiate the Holocaust. Hillgruber argued that the <i>Kernstück</i> (Nucleus) of Hitler's racist <i>Weltanschauung</i> (world-view) was to be found in <a href="../../../m/e/i/Mein_Kampf_b165.html" title="Mein Kampf">Mein Kampf</a>. He believed that the Holocaust was meant to be launched only with the invasion of the Soviet Union. In Hillgruber's view, Hitler's frequent references to "Judaeo-Bolshevism" to describe both Jews and Communism, betrayed his desire to destroy both simultaneously.</p>
<p>Hillgruber took a rather extreme “No Hitler, no Holocaust” position. He believed it was <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> and Hitler alone who made <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Holocaust_8edb.html" title="The Holocaust">the Holocaust</a> possible. He argued counter-factually, that even if the Nazis had come to power under some other leader such as <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermann_G%C3%B6ring_6dc0.html" title="Hermann Göring">Hermann Göring</a> or <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Goebbels_d1dd.html" title="Joseph Goebbels">Joseph Goebbels</a> for example, the Jews would have suffered persecution and discrimination, but not <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genocide.html" title="Genocide">genocide</a>. He maintained that the other Nazi leaders such as Göring, Geobbels and <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heinrich_Himmler_4919.html" title="Heinrich Himmler">Heinrich Himmler</a> willingly participated in the Holocaust, and as did many other Germans in the every-widening “rings of responsibility” for the Holocaust, but that without Hitler's decisive role, there would have been no Holocaust.</p>
<p>For Hillgruber, there were many elements of continuity in German foreign policy in the <a href="../../../1/8/7/1871.html" title="1871">1871</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a> period, especially in regard to <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Europe_ef2f.html" title="Eastern Europe">Eastern Europe</a>. To some extent he agreed with <a href="../../../f/r/i/Fritz_Fischer_a268.html" title="Fritz Fischer">Fritz Fischer</a>'s assessment that the differences between <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Empire_13a8.html" title="German Empire">Imperial</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/i/Weimar_Republic_9fad.html" title="Weimar Republic">Weimar</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_Germany_add9.html" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi</a> foreign policy were of degree rather than kind. Moreover, he accepted Fischer's argument that Germany was primarily responsible for <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>, but as a follower of the <i>Primat der Aussenpolitik</i> ("primacy of foreign policy") school, Hillgruber rejected Fischer's <i>Primat der Innenpolitik</i> ("primacy of domestic policy") argument as to why Germany started the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_World_War_31c9.html" title="First World War">First World War</a>. Hillgruber believed that what had happened in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1914.html" title="1914">1914</a> was a “calculated risk” on the part of <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Empire_13a8.html" title="German Empire">Imperial German government</a> that had gone horribly wrong. Germany had encouraged <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria-Hungary_d732.html" title="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a> to attack <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbia.html" title="Serbia">Serbia</a> in an attempt to break the informal <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triple_Entente_f747.html" title="Triple Entente">Triple Entente</a> alliance between the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> and <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a> by provoking a crisis that would concern Russia only. Hillgruber maintained that Germany did not want to cause a world war in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1914.html" title="1914">1914</a>, but, by pursuing a high-risk diplomatic strategy of provoking what was supposed to be only a limited war in the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balkans.html" title="Balkans">Balkans</a>, had inadvertently caused the wider conflict.</p>
<p>But, for Hillgruber, the changes introduced by National Socialist <i>Ostpolitik</i> (Eastern Policy) were so radical as to be almost differences of kind rather than degree. He argued that Nazi foreign policy was an extremely radical version of traditional German foreign policy. Furthermore, he argued that what during the Weimar era had been the ends became, for the Nazis, just the means. He presented a case that goals such as the re-militarization of the <a href="../../../r/h/i/Rhineland.html" title="Rhineland">Rhineland</a> and the <a href="../../../a/n/s/Anschluss.html" title="Anschluss">Anschluss</a> with <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austria</a> which been the end-goals during the Weimar period were just the beginning for the Nazis, who aimed at the complete domination of all Europe, especially of Eastern Europe, and ultimately world domination.</p>
<p>Hillgruber argued that <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> had an <i>Stufenplan</i> (stage by stage plan) for conquest and <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genocide.html" title="Genocide">genocide</a> in Eastern Europe. According to this argument, the first stage of Hitler's plan consisted of the military build-up of German strength and the achievement of the Weimar's traditional foreign policy goals. The second stage was to be a series of swift regional wars to destroy such states as <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a>, <a href="../../../c/z/e/Czechoslovakia.html" title="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>. The third stage was to be a war to liquidate the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> and what Hitler regarded as its "Judaeo-Bolshevik" regime. The fourth stage was to be a war against the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> by the now Greater Germany in alliance with the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Empire_782f.html" title="British Empire">British Empire</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>. Hillgruber argued that after the conquest of the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>, Hitler wanted to seize most of <a href="../../../a/f/r/Africa.html" title="Africa">Africa</a>, to build a huge <a href="../../../n/a/v/Navy.html" title="Navy">navy</a> and in alliance with both the Japanese and the British to engage with the United States in a “War of the Continents" for world domination. In the debate between the "Continentists" such as <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_Trevor-Roper%2C_Baron_Dacre_of_Glanton_211d.html" title="Hugh Trevor-Roper, Baron Dacre of Glanton">Hugh Trevor-Roper</a> and <a href="../../../e/b/e/Eberhard_J%C3%A4ckel_65f2.html" title="Eberhard Jäckel">Eberhard Jäckel</a>, who argued that Hitler wanted only to seize <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>, and the "Globalists", who argued that Hitler wanted to conquer the entire world, Hillgruber was definitely in the latter camp.</p>
<p>Hillgruber regarded Hitler as a fanatical ideologue with a firmly fixed programme, and criticized the view of him as a grasping opportunist with no real beliefs other than the pursuit of power--a thesis promoted by such British historians as <a href="../../../a/2E/j/A.J.P._Taylor_bde9.html" title="A.J.P. Taylor">A.J.P. Taylor</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Bullock_7121.html" title="Alan Bullock">Alan Bullock</a>, which he thought profoundly shallow and facile. Moreover, he categorically rejected Taylor’s contention that the German invasion of Poland was an “accident” precipitated by diplomatic blunders. Hillgruber argued adamantly that the German invasion of Poland was a war of aggression caused by Hitler’s ideological belief in war and the need for <i><a href="../../../l/e/b/Lebensraum.html" title="Lebensraum">Lebensraum</a></i> (Living Space). <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, for Hillgruber, really consisted of two wars. One was a “normal war” between the Western powers and Germany, a conflict which Hitler caused but did not really want. The other war--which Hitler both caused and most decidedly <i>did</i> want (as evidenced in part by <i><a href="../../../m/e/i/Mein_Kampf_b165.html" title="Mein Kampf">Mein Kampf</a></i>) was the German-Soviet one, a savage, merciless and brutal all-out struggle of racial and ideological extermination between German <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">National Socialism</a> and Soviet <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">Communism</a>.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, Hillgruber, together with <a href="../../../k/l/a/Klaus_Hildebrand_4949.html" title="Klaus Hildebrand">Klaus Hildebrand</a>, was involved in a very acrimonious debate with <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hans-Ulrich_Wehler_f037.html" title="Hans-Ulrich Wehler">Hans-Ulrich Wehler</a> over the merits of the <i>Primat der Aussenpolitik</i> and <i>Primat der Innenpolitik</i> schools. Hillgruber and Hildebrand made a case for the traditional <i>Primat der Aussenpolitik</i> approach to <a href="../../../d/i/p/Diplomatic_history.html" title="Diplomatic history">diplomatic history</a> with the stress on empirically examining the records of the relevant foreign ministry and studies of the foreign policy decision-making elite. Wehler, who favored the <i>Primat der Innenpolitik</i> for his part contended that diplomatic history should be treated as a sub-branch of <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_history.html" title="Social history">social history</a>, calling for theoretically-based research, and argued that the real focus should be on the study of the society in question.</p>
<p>A self-proclaimed <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservatism.html" title="Conservatism">conservative</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalism.html" title="Nationalism">nationalist</a>, Hillgruber never denied nor downplayed the crimes committed in Germany's name and in no way can he be considered a <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">Holocaust denier</a>; but he argued that Germany as a great power had the potential to do much good for Europe. For Hillgruber, the tragedy was that this potential was never fulfilled. In his view, the problem did not lie with Germany's domination of Eastern and Central Europe, but rather with the particular way this domination was exercised by the Nazis. He argued that German-Russian, German-Polish, German-Czech, German-Hungarian and German-Jewish relations were traditionally friendly, and lamented that the Nazis had shattered these friendly ties. Others contended that these bonds of friendship had never existed, except as figments of Hillgruber's imagination. For Hillgruber, Germany's defeat in 1945 was a catastrophe that ended both the ethnic German presence in Eastern Europe and Germany as a great power in Europe. As someone from the "Germanic East", Hillgruber wrote nostalgically of the lost <i>Heimat</i> of <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Prussia_9913.html" title="East Prussia">East Prussia</a> where he had grown up. Left-wing West German historians, together with their <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Germany_0033.html" title="East Germany">East German</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Polish</a>, <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hungary.html" title="Hungary">Hungarian</a> and <a href="../../../c/z/e/Czechoslovakia.html" title="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakian</a> counterparts, denounced him as a German chauvinist, racist and imperialist, and accused him of glorifying the <a href="../../../d/r/a/Drang_nach_Osten_5835.html" title="Drang nach Osten">Drang nach Osten</a> concept.</p>
<p>However, Hillgruber was prepared to accept, albeit grudgingly, what he often called Germany’s “Yalta frontiers” after the <a href="../../../y/a/l/Yalta_Conference_09f7.html" title="Yalta Conference">Yalta Conference</a> of 1945. What he was not prepared to accept was the partition of Germany. He often complained that the West German government was not doing enough to re-unite Germany. In a <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a> speech, he called on <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonn.html" title="Bonn">Bonn</a> to create a new German nationalism based on a respect for <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_rights.html" title="Human rights">human rights</a> that would ensure that future generations would not lose sight of the dream of re-unification.</p>
<p>Hillgruber was best known for his role in the <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historikerstreit.html" title="Historikerstreit">Historikerstreit</a> where he argued the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> was not a uniquely evil event. For Hillgruber, the crimes of <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Stalin_46d2.html" title="Joseph Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a> were just as terrible as the crimes of Hitler. He felt that <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Holocaust_8edb.html" title="The Holocaust">the Holocaust</a> was a horrific tragedy, but just one of many that occurred in the <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a>. In his highly controversial <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a> essay "<i>Der Zusammenbruch im Osten 1944/45</i>" ("<i>The Collapse in the East 1944/45</i>") from his book <i>Zweierlei Untergang</i> (<i>Two Kinds of Ruin</i>), Hillgruber highlighted the sufferings of Germans in what was then eastern Germany, who had to flee or were expelled or killed by the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Army_ccba.html" title="Red Army">Red Army</a>. He documented the mass gang-<a href="../../../r/a/p/Rape.html" title="Rape">rapings</a> of German women and girls, widespread looting and massacres of German civilians by the Soviet army. He paid homage to those who had had to evacuate the German population and to those soldiers who did their best to stem the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet.html" title="Soviet">Soviet</a> advance. Hillgruber described the efforts to evacuate the German population, much of which was hopelessly bungled by corrupt and incompetent <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_Party_3bfc.html" title="Nazi Party">Nazi Party</a> officials, and the savage and desperate fighting which marked the bloody climax of the war on the <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Front_%28World_War_II%29_e4c6.html" title="Eastern Front (World War II)">Eastern Front</a>. For Hillgruber, the end of the "German East", in which he had been born and grew up, was just as tragic as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Holocaust_8edb.html" title="The Holocaust">the Holocaust</a> and marked the end of what he considered to be Eastern Europe's best chance for progress. The two kinds of ruin in the title were the Holocaust and the <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expulsion_of_Germans_after_World_War_II_31b3.html" title="Expulsion of Germans after World War II">expulsion</a> of <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reichsdeutsche.html" title="Reichsdeutsche"><i>Reichdeutsch</i></a> (Reich Germans; those Germans living in Germany) and <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volksdeutsche.html" title="Volksdeutsche"><i>Volksdeutsche</i></a> (ethnic Germans living outside of Germany). For Hillgruber, both events, or "national catastrophes" as he preferred to call them, were equally tragic. He blamed both ultimately on the Nazis. Perhaps most controversially, Hillgruber asked that historians should henceforward extend a measure of sympathy to what he regarded as the “heroic” and “self-sacrificing” stand of the Wehrmacht against the Red Army in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>. <i>Zweierlei Untergang</i> was a short book comprising two essays; one of which was a well regarded summary (at least by those who take an Intentionalist position such as <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Lukacs_20c4.html" title="John Lukacs">John Lukacs</a>) of the history of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Holocaust_8edb.html" title="The Holocaust">the Holocaust</a>, and the other which concerned the ending of the "Germanic East".</p>
<p><i>Zweierlei Untergang</i> ignited a firestorm of controversy. Some of the historians who took issue with Hillgruber’s essay included <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hans_Mommsen_5582.html" title="Hans Mommsen">Hans Mommsen</a>, <a href="../../../e/b/e/Eberhard_J%C3%A4ckel_65f2.html" title="Eberhard Jäckel">Eberhard Jäckel</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heinrich_August_Winkler_99c4.html" title="Heinrich August Winkler">Heinrich August Winkler</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Broszat_7dfc.html" title="Martin Broszat">Martin Broszat</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hans-Ulrich_Wehler_f037.html" title="Hans-Ulrich Wehler">Hans-Ulrich Wehler</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Dietrich_Bracher_804f.html" title="Karl Dietrich Bracher">Karl Dietrich Bracher</a>, and <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolfgang_Mommsen_6bc5.html" title="Wolfgang Mommsen">Wolfgang Mommsen</a>. One of Hillgruber’s leading critics during the <i>Historikerstreit</i> was the philosopher <a href="../../../j/%C3%BC/r/J%C3%BCrgen_Habermas_115d.html" title="Jürgen Habermas">Jürgen Habermas</a> who attacked Hillgruber for allegedly praising the “True and tried Nazi Party officials in the East”. In fact, Hillgruber had written no such sentence. What Hillgruber had written was a lengthy sentence in which he had commented that different officials of the Nazi Party in eastern Germany evacuated the German public with varying degrees of success. What Habermas had done was to edit Hillgruber’s sentence selectively and remove the customary “…”’s that indicate a space to produce the sentence about the “True and tried Nazi Party officials in the East”. Hillgruber was enraged at what he considered to be a fabricated quote being attributed to him. Many felt that this was an intellectually disreputable method of attacking Hillgruber.</p>
<p>Criticism centered around a number of areas. The following points were raised against Hillgruber:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hillgruber largely ignored the fact that the reason why Soviet troops were in Germany in 1945 was because Germany had attacked the Soviet Union in 1941.</li>
<li>Hillgruber mostly ignored the fact that the same troops fighting to save German civilians from the Soviets were also allowing the Nazis to continue the Holocaust.</li>
<li>That the expulsion of Germans from Eastern Europe (which today might come under the rubric of "<a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_cleansing.html" title="Ethnic cleansing">ethnic cleansing</a>") cannot be equated with the racially-based extermination of European Jewry.</li>
<li>The sufferings of Germans were presented in isolation, with little reference to the sufferings of Jews, Poles, Russians, Czechs, etc. The impression given is that Germans were the primary victims of the war.</li>
<li>That Hillgruber asked his readers to sympathize with the officers and men of the German <a href="../../../w/e/h/Wehrmacht.html" title="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a> and <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kriegsmarine.html" title="Kriegsmarine">Kriegsmarine</a> who fought to protect and evacuate the German population is morally indefensible.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the eyes of Hillgruber's critics, this line of argument discredited him as a serious historian and put him in the same league of cranks like <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Irving_2e5a.html" title="David Irving">David Irving</a>. The American historian <a href="../../../d/e/b/Deborah_Lipstadt_3be0.html" title="Deborah Lipstadt">Deborah Lipstadt</a> accused Hillgruber of <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">Holocaust denial</a>. His defenders have argued that his work shows that <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> is more morally complex then it is usually presented, and that he was merely highlighting a little known chapter of history.</p>
