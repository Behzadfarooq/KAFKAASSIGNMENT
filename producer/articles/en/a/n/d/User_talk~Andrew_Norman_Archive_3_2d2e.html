<p>It is not spam. Each link goes directly to the author's work plus the translations. There are over 79,000 documents in this archive that took over a year to put together. It is non-commercial and a useful project which betters the art. It is also a lot of work going through here and customizing each of these links. Just saying it is spam does not make it so.

<p>I'm not getting involved in the spam/PoetryForEveryone issue, but it would help to have more clear edit comments then just revert when removing what on the surface appears to be a useful link.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 08:30, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"On the surface" is the point. What has actually been going on is that dozens of links have been added to a site which is republishing copyrighted work by living authors. It's linkspam, and I've removed the links (hence the abbreviated edit summaries, or none at all in the case of rollbacks). If people are genuinely interested in poetry, they'll do more than just add links to their own website from an alphabetical list of poets. I might accept this as a genuine mistake if the person who had inserted all the links had <i>any</i> prior history of contributions to Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 09:29, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But "on the surface" is the point. If the change is not obvious on the surface, then the edit comment needs to explain it; for instance, something like "Reverting systematic link-spam to pages of poets" people wouldn't have to chase down talk pages to understand why the revert was undertaken.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 09:38, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As things stand, that would prevent me from using the rollback function which is intended to make removing this sort of systematic spamming far easier. It doesn't take a huge amount of effort for people to check the talk and contributions pages of User:PoetryForEveryone and myself if they are concerned. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 11:32, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">so are they too spam?</span></h3>
<p>As the previous poster said, the links are useful. There are not big translation initiatives out there. The project is sponsored by someone in the community and they are just as valid - if not more than any other archive link presently allowed. It is non-commercial, there are not even any banner ads.</p>
<p>None of your points address its being spam or not. There are collection and archive listings all through the poet pages now - so are they too spam? As far as the site ownership - every site is owned by someone, so what. Just because the links are being set at one time does not mean it is spam - it just means that months and months of work are finished and now people can be shown where the useful information is. As far as a .com address - you are really grasping for straws. Clearly you have no interest in poetry, but do not steal away from others informational opportunities you do not understand or care for. You are standing in the way of forward progress - please move. ~Chris PoetryForEveryone 08:40, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The project scrapes together a collection of in- and out-of-copyright poetry from other sources on the net. Checking a few poets at random, I can't find anything which hasn't been directly copied from plagiarist.com (the same seventeen poems by A. R. Ammons, the same forty by Allen Ginsberg, etc). Computer translation is nothing new, and is especially inappropriate when translating poetry. As far as I can tell the sole purpose of that collection of poems is to provide extra traffic to Bryant McGill's personal website, not to provide anything which isn't already available on the web (and which, in many cases, should not be available). If it's really a valuable resource, other people will link to it in their own time. It isn't, which is why they haven't been. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 17:34, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The fact that you would say "Computer translation is nothing new," tells me you are ignorant of the project objectives. The purpose is to start building a directory of human translated works. And, there are no links to it yet because it is a new project and you have deleted them. You are a detriment to quality content. I just went through and looked at dozens of poet pages you are so "concerned" about that all point to truly frivolous archives of poetry that are slathered with ads promoting fraudulent poetry contests and deceptive sales materials that rip-off and steal money from unknowing aspiring artists. These sites are there for one purpose, to make the owners money. That is what Wikipedia is doing right now under your poor stewardship; aiding these people. You are helping these theives. Yet, when someone comes along who is trying to do something that could be beneficial, and with no commercial angles you will not allow it. You are simply wrong and are misusing your power. This is my final comment. ~Chris PoetryForEveryone 19:08, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am going to look up my nerdy database of jazz recordings tonight. Miles Davis is a really obvious one (Newport performance which revitalised his career, and naming his first Columbia album after the tune). But there are hundreds, maybe thousands - I happened to have a few CDs with me at work, and sure enough there are a couple with versions of the tune (Lee Konitz/ Brad Mehldau / Charlie Haden and Susanne Abbeuhl). --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 12:17, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I'm afraid after reading the talk page and the article, I don't see any NPOV problems which spill out into the article. There's a lot of discussion (some of it rather too heated, but generally on the right side of the line), but nothing which requires my assistance as an admin, and although I have a couple of books on the subject which I'll take a look at over the next few days, I'm not really knowledgeable enough in this area to contribute much. Keep talking, try to keep calm, and try to put your side of the case in a clear, <i>concise</i> manner without casting aspersions as to the motives of the "other side". If people have to read through pages and pages of text in which you're accusing them of bias, that isn't going to make them come round to your point of view. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 15:12, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have written the John Tunnard article myself virtually from scratch. All common information such as birthdates dates etc are widely available. I am annoyed that the Edward Bingham article was deleted since I wrote this myself; and I have no copy of it out side of Wikipedia.The ultimatum I was given to state my sources or copyright status etc was given over the Xmas holiday period; and I had no access to a computer at this time.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">User Delaney is vandalising the categorical imperative page</span></h2>
<p>The changes recently affected by user Delaney comprise several passages, which were rejected by different user's as pow. Pleas read the talk page of "categorical imperative". The very beginning starts with a pow criticism about a topic that delaney reintroduces.</p>
<p>"<i>Hi, I like your article a lot, however I feel that the part about abortion and animal rights expresses your personal point of view. I agree with this statement: "Only rational and autonomous beings are held to have intrinsic worth under this account, and objects or creatures that are not autonomous are held to have no moral worth at all" From this you conclude that animals and fetus have no intrinsic moral value. But this conclusion may only be drawn, if you knew for sure that animals and fetus are non-rational beings. How do you know? I'm sorry, but you really don't know. For a Kantian philosopher a human being acquires a moral status, once it becomes a rational being having a free will. But, when does this happen? Nobody really knows for sure. In somewhat religious terms, one may ask: When does the soul enter the human body? Kilian Klaiber</i></p>
<p>This is a problem with writing style. When I wrote the original article, I was saying "according to Kant" almost every third sentence and it was getting tedious. Therefore, I wrote at the top of the article that "[The argument] is outlined here according to the arguments therein." and removed a bunch of the qualifiers. If you can think of a better way to clarify this, I would appreciate it. --malathion talk 04:39, 13 August 2005 (UTC) I would have to agree about the abortion section. I agree that Kant would probably have followed the line of reasoning you describe, but I don't think that including that section is warranted without citing direct textual support from a work by or about Kant, and I don't personally know of any work arguing that Kant would have held such a position. -BLC<i>"</i></p>
<p>User malathion is actually Mr. Delayne. Nevertheless a section about abortion was introduced without any textual support or any argument. I consider this to be vandalism.</p>
<p>I would like to add that user Delayne has been criticised numerous times of introducint POW, nevertherless he keeps on reintroducing his personel point of view. I quote the discussion page:</p>
<p>"<i>The discussion took place in the section titled "Criticism section" above. --Ryan Delaney talk 14:52, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</i> I see lot of criticisms of the criticism here. It seems that people got tired of arguing with you and left, rather than agreeing. Please read Wikipedia:Neutral point of view "The neutral point of view is a means of dealing with conflicting views. The policy requires that, where there are or have been conflicting views, these are fairly presented, but not asserted. All significant points of view are presented, not just the most popular one. It is not asserted that the most popular view or some sort of intermediate view among the different views is the correct one. Readers are left to form their own opinions." Many important views are excluded now. Instead, a POV-fork has been created to avoid NPOV. This is forbidden. "A POV fork is an attempt to evade NPOV guidelines by creating a new article about a certain subject that is already treated in an article often to avoid or highlight negative or positive viewpoints or facts. This is generally considered unacceptable. The generally accepted policy is that all facts and majority Point of Views on a certain subject are treated in one article." <i>Ultramarine 15:01, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</i></p>

<dd>As is made clear at the top of <a href="../../../c/a/t/Talk%7ECategorical_imperative_ae77.html" title="Talk:Categorical imperative">Talk:Categorical imperative</a>, Delaney's source is Christine Korsgaard's book, referenced at the end of the article itself. Adding material to an article which you personally disagree with is not "vandalism". Removing relevant material for which there is no consensus for removal <i>is</i> vandalism. Please don't do it. I'd like you to read <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a> and <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a> before making this sort of allegation again - to quote the vandalism policy, "Any good-faith effort to improve the encyclopedia, even if misguided or ill-considered, is not vandalism." NPOV doesn't mean you can cut out any opinion you don't like, it means that articles must give space to both sides of a genuine and reasonable disagreement. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 18:00, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well, then introducing material for which there is no general consensus must be vandalism too. The abortion article reads as follows:</p>
<pre>
Abortion and animal rights
</pre>
<p>A Kantian mode of thinking suggests that these issues are, in principle, identical. Only rational and autonomous beings are held to have intrinsic worth under Kant's account, and objects or creatures that are not autonomous are held to have no moral value at all; rather, such entities only have contingent worth, based on their value to the world of rational beings. Consequently, any action performed by or to an animal, an unborn fetus, a stem cell, or a string of human DNA would have no moral content[citation needed]. These non-persons are merely means to an end, and never ends in themselves.</p>
<p>First of all, this passage seems to convey Kant's point of view. This is not possible, since the concept of stem cells and DNA didn't even exist in Kants time. Nevertheless, the article insinuates that this is Kant's opinion (mode of thinking). That's a wild guess. That's outrageous. If Mrs. Korsgaard believes that this reasoning is consistent with the categorical imperative, then it should be presented as Mrs. Korsgaard's opinion. But it isn't. In my opinion Mr. Delaney is misusing his powers and I'm not the first user to raise the issue. Last but not least, the purported citation is missing: "[citation needed]"</p>
<p>Best regards</p>

<dl>
<dd>Please go away and read the two policies I suggested. The section on abortion does <i>not</i> seem to convey Kant's point of view (it refers to "a Kantian mode of thinking"), and it is part of a section which is <i>explicitly</i> about possible applications of the concept to <i>contemporary</i> debates, which again is clearly described as <i>not</i> being due to Kant himself. You seem to have completely misinterpreted this section, and Delaney's attitude to this section. I've just added the citation, I'm not sure why you couldn't have done this yourself. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 18:26, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>"Korsgaard, 1996" Great citation, on what page, which book or article? Furthermore it is completely unclear what part of the abortion paragraph relates to Mrs Korsgards opinion and which part deals with Kant. The terms "Kantian mode of thinking" and "under Kant's account" do in fact insinuate that this paragraph is dealing with Kants opinion. So please go away and read the article. The opening sentence of the paragraph is pov too: "The interpretation of the categorical imperative is, in most cases, descriptive and uncontroversial." There are in fact many controversies about the application of the categorical imperative. The article itself states several controversies. The paragraph claims to deal with contemporary debates, but initially it doesn't. The following paragraph about deception doesn't deal at all with a modern application to a contemporary debate, it correctly cites Kant personel point of view. Then the abortion paragraph is introduced. This passage insuates to be dealing with Kant's point of view, since the interpretation of the categorical imperative is supposedly uncontroversial and according to Kant's mode of thinking. If you had read the article attentively you would have probably noticed these inconsistencies.</p>

<dd>The citation, in standard academic style, refers to the book listed at the bottom of the article. If you ask Ryan Delaney nicely, he might put in a page number, but it's a half-decent citation as it stands, and the two phrases you quote do <i>not</i> imply that the section is paraphrasing Kant's own views. You're now raising red herrings about other parts of the article - can I suggest that you put these, in plain English and without citing great chunks of previous sections of the talk page, <i>on the article's own talk page</i>? Preferably with suggestions as to how they might be improved, rather than just moaning. All your "contributions" to Wikipedia so far have consisted of deleting material, and complaining on talk pages (some of it remarkably ill-informed complaint). What about doing something constructive? --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 20:34, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Standard acamedic style? You haven't written any academic papers yet have you? These paragraphs do imply that they are presenting Kant's view. Please read all of the arguments above. You started talking about other parts of the article in order to make your point. But you failed to cite the whole introductory paragraph. I just quoted one sentence you deleted, and your response is: "Your now raising red herrings." Now your starting to talk about my personal integrity instead of whether the paragraph is POW. The paragraph was reintroduced although two different users criticised it for good reasons. The paragraph was reintroduced virtually unchanged. Therefore, I believe that reintroducing the paragraph is vandalism. I have made several suggestions for improval, which you obviously did not notice. You're doing a poor job as administrator.</p>

<dd>It's <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_referencing.html" title="Harvard referencing">Harvard referencing</a>, to be exact. You seem to be very confused about the difference between quoting and citing, and who is deleting what (<i>I</i> haven't deleted anything from the article, I restored your deletions). I'm not going to bother responding any further - you obviously <i>still</i> haven't read the two policies I asked you to read, because you still completely misunderstand what "vandalism" and "point of view" mean in this context. I'm afraid I've come to the conclusion that you're just trolling. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 23:04, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Harvard referencing: "When you can (or should) provide a page number, the convention is (Smith 2005: 73). When the citation provides the reference for a quote that is within the text and marked by quotation marks, the citation follows the end-quotation mark ("), and preceeds the period (.) When the citation provides the reference for a quote that is indented, it follows the period."</p>
<p>I'm afraid I've come to the conclusion that you're just completely incompetent and your just love not to talk about the topic, namely point of view and vandalism. Vers silly! Kikl 23:49, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>By the way, Mr. Delaney has deleted your citation of Mrs. Koorsgard's book, because she doesn't say that in her book. I advise you to read the books that you cite. Citing books you haven't read does not comply with scientific standards and may be considered to be scientific fraud.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<dl>
<dd>I came across you when you edited an article I contributed to and am now watching. I noticed you are an Administrator. I'm fairly new to Wikipedia, and am still learning how to navigate it. I am astounded by the number and degree of sheer vandalism that occurs in the articles. I believe that allowing anyone - with or without a formal, trackable Wikipedia account - to edit is much of the problem. What is the argument against requiring anyone who edits to have such an account? <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_David_03f9.html" title="User:Michael David">Michael David</a> 13:02, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm one among several hundred administrators (804 according to <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_administrators_8c59.html" title="Wikipedia:List of administrators">Wikipedia:List_of_administrators</a>), so it's nothing special, really. I'd encourage anyone to sign up for an account - I don't think "drive by" edits are a good idea, where someone visits the site, makes a couple of changes and then never comes back, because they won't pick up on the culture and what's expected. And if people <i>are</i> going to stick around, having an account makes a lot of sense (if only for the watchlist, and the fact that most people are suspicious of edits made by anonymous IP editors). There is now "<a href="../../../s/e/m/Wikipedia%7ESemi-protection_policy_9387.html" title="Wikipedia:Semi-protection policy">semi-protection</a>", which stops anons and new users from editing an article, and in some cases I think it would be a good idea to block people who don't have 6 months' standing from editing. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Locke_68b4.html" title="John Locke">John Locke</a>, for some reason I can't explain, gets anonymous people inserting obscenities and nonsense almost every day. But having an account actually means you're <i>less</i> trackable in some ways - anyone can see the IP address of an anonymous user, but that information's only accessible to a select few for logged-in users. I think Wikipedia benefits from the openness of allowing anyone to edit, but as you say there are an awful lot of people out there with nothing better to do than put <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Locke&amp;diff=38961203&amp;oldid=38957584" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Locke&amp;diff=38961203&amp;oldid=38957584" rel="nofollow">this sort of thing</a> into articles about seventeenth-century philosophers. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 00:10, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Midgley, anon user, etc.</span></h2>
<p>Since I don't want to turn the incident board in a protracted discussion, I'd like to bring the discussion here.</p>
<p>(First of all, I'm not going to defend the "original invisible anon" or whatever he/she calls himself/herself, and I've repeatedly requested that he/she register. His/her response is that he/she is refusing to do so as a protest against "admin subculture," and I've responded I think there are better ways of making that point.)</p>
<p>Having said that, I am deeply concerned about the implied practice of allowing for bad behavior such as Midgley's if the provocation is bad enough. I'm concerned for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is at odds with the way other sanctions are applied at Wikipedia, where the motto seems to be "we don't get into content disputes, we only react to behavior."</li>
<li>Especially on the incident board, it invites protracted discussions on what led to what, and by whom. It seems to me that the board should simply cite and document violations, so that admins can investigate.</li>
<li>It invites a pissing contest about who is most provoked in a given situation. I can show you that Midgley engages in personal attacks and put-downs in (conservatively) 70% of his messages - just who is most right to be provoked is certainly debatable.</li>
<li>It encourages people to try out other forms of bad behavior if they think the ends justify the means.</li>
<li>At this point, I wouldn't be surprised if some of the nuttier partisans in the various debates with Midgley do the same, just to make a point. I promise I won't, but I'm not going to condemn anyone who does.</li>

<dd>Thanks. What I'm hoping to do here is cut out <i>all</i> of the personal stuff, and that includes Midgley as well as the others. Midgley hasn't gained anything by this, and there's nothing to be gained for the encyclopedia as a whole by blocking at this point. As I said on the noticeboard, the options now are to forget the past and move forward, or to dig up the past and let the formal dispute resolution process decide.

<p>I don't have access to it. One of the tropes in the (ghastly, interminable, abusive) process of constructing <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-vaccinationist.html" title="Anti-vaccinationist">anti-vaccinationist</a> is that some of them are attempting to present <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antoine_Bechamp_aa85.html" title="Antoine Bechamp">Antoine Bechamp</a>'s early view of life from unlike cells as more correct than Pasteur's demonstrations etc etc - thus vacciantion would not work etc etc. Which proceeds from which is unclear as yet - I suspect that they mostly proceed backward from their conclusion grasping for straws as they go but that is not established. Might you feel inclined to add anything that seems apropriate from that refetrence, or indeed give any view you care to, over there?</p>
<p>If the main article looks too horrid to contemplate, there is a nascent one copied from anti-catholicism at <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-vaccinationist_catholic_herald_cc22.html" title="Anti-vaccinationist/catholic herald">anti-vaccinationist/catholic herald</a> which I think may replace the original, since it starts with _structure_ even if search and replaces leave it thus far as complete porridge in its specifics.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Spamming" details</span></h2>
<p>Thank you for your comment on Antony Flew's talk page. Obviously we cannot agree. As I see it, political dinners are important in political circles. Who attended them therefore gives the event a certain meaning. Who agreed to speak/be guest-of-honour indicates whether the organisation hosting the event was worth it/respectable. I did not "spam" anything. I merely went to the various pages of the notable right-wing attendees and placed the event information there also, as it was just as relevant to them all as it was to Flew. One of the crucially important things about Wikipedia are the links, so that when a reader of an article, any article, which mentions the event, wants information on others also present to see what those individuals were all about, they can click on the link. By removing them/the links, this major anti-communist event loses all political significance. <a href="../../../s/u/s/User%7ESussexman_47c3.html" title="User:Sussexman">Sussexman</a> 13:59, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm talking about the claim that his final expedition was to take magnetic measurements rather than to find the NW passage. The ODNB, for example, says the expedition was organised by the Admiralty to find a final 300 mile stretch. That was written by Dr Beau Riffenburgh of the Scott Polar Research Institute at the University of Cambridge.

<dd>The fact that you've provided no evidence, just your own opinion.

<dd>I did offer evidence, that he was in favor of infanticide. You're not playing straight here. Also, consider that per Wikipedia, "humanism is a broad category of active ethical philosophies that affirm the dignity and worth of all people." Singer most certainly does not affirm the dignity and worth of all people, quite the opposite. He has targeted groups of people as being worthy of possible termination. That is not humanism. Also, I would like to warn you that reverting an article without attempting to reach consensus via talk is in violation of WP.

<dd>That has no bearing on whether or not he is a humanist (in several of those "broad categories"), and if we're going to get into Wikilawyering, you're the one removing information from an entry without providing justification in talk. "People" (or to be more technical, "person") is the key issue here - it's obvious you don't like Singer's conclusions (I don't much, either), but do you actually know what his reasons are for them? --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 09:55, 9 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, but humanism doesn't seem to include inflicting death on others for the sake of expediency. Also, the onus was on you to use talk, as you reverted an edit, instead of trying to work it out in talk. I was not reverting an edit to any clear or recent editor.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Regarding <i>too many people from the former Yugoslavia who seem to see Wikipedia as a chance to continue the wars of the 1990s by other means</i>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Can you help us deal with vandals?</span></h2>
<p>Hi :)</p>
<p>If I have been to harsh in my last message here, I deeply apologise :).</p>
<p>I fully understand that You are pissed on balkan-related (Serbian, Croatian, Albanian...) vandals that make endless reverts without explanation. Well, I'mm pissed too. Yesterday, I was aditionally pissed because I become collateral victim (Your comment didn't really made me happy, you know) of a user who was as pisses as I am, and for the same reason.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you are really sick of those endless edit-wars, that mean you are the right person for the job!</p>
<p>We have problems with bunch pro-serbian users who vandalise Croatia-related articles and are mostly unwilling to make any compromise. Since somewhere around May 10th, great number of pro-serbian vandals came to wikipedia with only one goal - defamation of Croatia. These people didn't came here in good faith. They came here to defame Croatia.</p>
<p>I don't have the problem with users being pro-serbian in general. I know of many serbian users who I really repsect. But, I really don't like vandals. Even some Serbian users expressed their discust with those "new" pro-serbian (or anti-croatian, to be more precisely) vandals.</p>
<p>We <b>allready have some admins</b> from Croatia on our side who could block those users right away, but they refuse to do so because <b>they feel too involved</b>.</p>
<p>So, what we have here is:</p>
<ul>
<li>pro-serbian side: number of users who are either newbies (up to 3-4 months on wiki) plus bunch of IP-users that doesn't even bother to write anything longer then "<i>REV</i>" and who limit their contributions to edit-wars</li>
<li>pro-croatian users with much longer experience here (including <b>2 admins</b> unwilling to use their powers) whos edit-waring is secondary to other contributions (<a href="../../../z/m/a/User%7EZmaj_19ba.html" title="User:Zmaj">user:Zmaj</a> wrote tens of articles related to Croatian culture while trying to solve conflicts on the other side!)</li>
</ul>
<p>So, <b>we desperately need third-party administrators</b>! This edit-wars has been going on for more that a month and it is really getting frustrating. I feel we are left alone because some people see us as a <i>blood-thirsty balcan tribes that are best left alone</i>. Well, we are not! And we need your help.</p>

<p>You know that you're wrong, but your pride doesn't let you admit it. If you do, I'm sure everyone will accept that you've admited that you were wrong, and probably respect you much more than right now. You know that you shouldn't have protected my page, I didn't add anything, I only moved it. The user that added it is blocked, isn't that enough for you? I did not break my promise, and you know it. Secondly, nationalism is "Long Live Greater Serbia" and "Death to Croats" and similar stuff. "Kosovo is Serbia" is NOT nationalism, it's simply reality, check the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_1244_9e43.html" title="United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244">1244 UN resolution</a>. So, simply because I wrote that the holy land of all <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbs.html" title="Serbs">Serbs</a> (check <i><a href="../../../k/o/s/Kosovo.html#Kingdom_of_the_Serbs" title="Kosovo">Kosovo is Serbia</a></i>) is Serbia, which it is (check <i><a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbia.html" title="Serbia">Serbia</a></i> and take a look if Kosovo is in Serbia), you protected my page for "nationalism". Did you know that loving your country is patriotic, not nationalistic?

<dd>Hi Andrew! I was actually searching for something else and saw this by coincidence. I don’t know precisely what you did, but if you erased such thing as “Kosovo is Serbia” or similar, I must say, you were right. Of course, it depends what people think nationalism is. But the fact is that such sentences as “Kosovo is Serbia”, “Kosovo is a heart of Serbia”, “Kosovo is a holy land of Serbia” etc were used and are still being used from ultra nationalistic parties and groups in Serbia. I guess their nationalistic medial brainwashing machine repeated that so often, so that many Serbs started to believe in that, they even think there is nothing nationalistic about it. Sad but true.</dd>
<dd>You have my support for the future, if you have any problems because of these things, and also if you need any translations, because I don’t know if you can speak any language from Balkans. Wikipedia should be an encyclopaedia and absolutely free from these kind of nationalistic paroles!

<p>Much as I dislike user Bormalagurski and his political views, I think he is right on this. He has all the right to express his political views and to say that he does not want a province of his country to be independent. I personally think that Kosovo should be independent, especially after what happened during Milosevic's rule. But he has the right to express this opinion on wikipedia which is by no means offensive. Its not like he is saying "I think the Albanian minority should be ethnically cleansed from Kosovo." He is just denouncing further dismemberment of his country.I think you should unblock his page and simply keep an eye on it in case he does include offensive material. He has done so in the past. --<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurgas00_25ab.html" title="User:Burgas00">Burgas00</a> 11:03, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Many users express their political views in these boxes on their user pages. It is no big deal and Bormalagurski should be allowed to do so as everyone else does. So as long this does not include attacks on other nations or individuals. Claiming that Kosovo should remain part of Serbia is perfectly acceptable. Especially considering that legally it still is part of Serbia.--<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurgas00_25ab.html" title="User:Burgas00">Burgas00</a> 14:09, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well either all users who express political opinions have their user pages edited and protected or this particular page is unprotected.

<dd>I wouldn't have any problem at all with people being asked to remove such material from their user pages. However, Bormalagurski was asked to remove stuff which was far worse than simply expressing an opinion on a political topic, he chose to play games, and this is the end result. His choice, and not my problem if he doesn't like the consequences of his decision. I'm not going to start playing "the other kids are doing it too". --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 16:03, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes and I was among the people who edited the offensive stuff out. I was even blocked for 24h by a friend of User C-c-c-c (who is now permanently banned) for mildly verbally abusing him.

<p>Being a war refugee myself, I can't see why we should tolerate people making political statements, which are divisive and inflammatory, whether pro or against or whatever. This is an encyclopedia not a battleground. They'd attack me for "censoring" or "violating freedom of speech", but I know it's the right thing to do.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Gibraltar</span></h2>
<p>Hello Norman:</p>
<p>I would like to ask you a favour. Could you please have a look at the talk page and history of the article on <a href="../../../g/i/b/Gibraltar.html" title="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>. Over the past few months a number of users, including myself, have been in conflict with user:Gibnews. We feel he has taken over the page as his pet project and has imposed a NPOV pro-Gibraltarian point of view. I feel his attitude and utter refusal to acheive any form of consensus is contrary to the rules of wikipedia. He accuses everyone of Spanish propaganda even on issues which are not directly related to the Anglo-Spanish dispute over Gibraltar and reverts pretty much everything which is not written by himself. Although I am not Spanish, I sometimes wonder if I may be slightly biased towards the Spanish perspective. I do not however believe that Gibraltar should be Spanish and I try to remain as neutral as possible. I do not have a problem with Gibnew's views. I simply do not approve of his way of discarding other people's sources, opinions etc... You should perhaps consult other users for their opinions such as user:ecemaml and user:asterion.</p>
<p>That is why I ask you, as an English-man, to mediate or atleast give your perspective on this issue.</p>
<p>Please look at the talk page over the past few months. Conflict with user Gibnews seems to go a long way back.</p>
<p>Thankyou very much for your help. We would really appreciate it. There is nothing worse that when articles are hijacked by individuals with political agendas.</p>
