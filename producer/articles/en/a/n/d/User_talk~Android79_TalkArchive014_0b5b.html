<p>Hi</p>
<p>As you monitor the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Jackson_1873.html" title="Michael Jackson">Michael Jackson</a> page, could I refer you to the <a href="../../../h/i/s/HIStory_0363.html" title="HIStory">HIStory</a> article. An editor called User:Appropiate, who has also been editing anonymously as User:81.106.165.39 and User:81.106.166.184 is constantly violating <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> in regard to this article, despite numerous warnings. I have reverted twice and informed him of <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>, and also <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> as he did in his edit summary. As an admin, could you watch this for a few days as I don't want to voilate <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> myself.

<p>Could you please also read the comments he has made to me on the <a href="../../../h/i/s/Talk%7EHIStory_3b60.html" title="Talk:HIStory">Talk:HIStory</a> page and perhaps comment on them also.

<dd>Android79, I apologise about the past few days, I have explained on HIStory's, talk page - though I have changed my mind, I staying. About your change to my extension to HIStory's "Criticism &amp; Controversy" - I understand WP:V (I shall verify it with sources) and WP:NOR (I shall provide reliable links to prove it's not just my conception), but WP:NPOV I do not understand. I know what the latter regulation is all about, but I don't know what violates this in the writing, I carefully tried to keep it neutral - perhaps you could tell me what parts concern you on HIStory's talk page. Thanks, and sorry again. By the way I'm not sure what a gorm is - someone called me it once and I liked the word, but I shouldn't have said it to Funky Monkey, and I have since apologized and familiarized with wikipedia rules fr.Appropiate.

<p>Hi Android79. I notice that you removed my attempt to specify a political orientation for Glenn Reynolds's blog. This morning I modified a bunch of blogger articles and one was Reynolds. I inferred that he is a conservative commentator. You disagree with my "pigeonholing", a term that implies that I am trying to diminish Reynold's blog via framing. His blog is distinctly non-liberal and he very frequently takes conservative stances (although these are not always Republican stances) since this is an encyclopedia it is appropriate to attempt to describe things and thus I am allowed to add adjectives to his blog to inform readings of the subject. If you wanted to correct it to libertarian that would be okay -- conservatism and libertarianism are very similar. When did conservative become pejorative? Why are you police-ing this article? --<a href="../../../b/h/o/User%7EBhouston_eea6.html" title="User:Bhouston">Ben Houston</a> 17:00, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>BTW one major problem I had with your response is that you cite Glenn Reynolds as the authority of his political orientation. That is not a NPOV source. Most intelligent political commentators are very good at rhetorical techniques and framing, thus it is important that Wikipedia doesn't become a slave to their "sensitivities". --<a href="../../../b/h/o/User%7EBhouston_eea6.html" title="User:Bhouston">Ben Houston</a> 17:09, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Who said "conservative" was pejorative? I only removed it because it was inaccurate – you stated that you "inferred" he is a conservative, from what I don't know. Reynolds is pro-choice and supports gay rights, and has frequently described himself as having libertarian beliefs. I disagree that Reynolds is a POV source when it comes to his own political orientation, as long as it is stated in the right way. "Reynolds describes himself as a libertarian" would be an accurate, NPOV way of presenting that. Inserting the adjective "conservative" is not only inaccurate, it is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, since you "inferred" that he is a conservative and that he runs a "distinctly non-liberal" blog. The reason I simply removed "conservative" rather than replacing it with "libertarian" is that I wanted to find a post on his blog in which he self-describes as a libertarian before making that assertion, so we would have <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> information in the article.</p>
<p>I am not "policing" this article; I have it on my watchlist, saw some inaccurate information being added, and removed it. I resent your accusatory tone. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color:#072764">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color:#c6011f">79</span></a> 18:04, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Here is an analysis of Glenn Reynold's political orientation and decides that he does fit under the "conservative" big tent: <a href="http://nospeedbumps.com/?p=700" class="external autonumber" title="http://nospeedbumps.com/?p=700" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Here is an article Glenn wrote for Salon in which he is introduced as a "prominent conservative blogger": <a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2005/03/31/reynolds/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2005/03/31/reynolds/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. He is also one of the stars featured on www.thoseshirts.com, where "conservative humor, superior quality, and professional artistry come together." Anyways, I'll leave the article as is. I stand behind my original addition, I was not adding "inaccurate information", although I will accept that it wasn't properly referenced. --<a href="../../../b/h/o/User%7EBhouston_eea6.html" title="User:Bhouston">Ben Houston</a> 21:19, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I would like to understand a little bit more about why you felt it appropriate to delete our work and what we can do to make it more palatable to you and others.

Semantics - they specifically targeted me, but no one else, in their Talk pages, thinking I was able to conjure IP addresses. But you avoided the question - why weren't those 3 users also punished under the 3RR rule? The inconsistencies, double standards, and outright hypocrisy is evident. The problem here is there is no one to look after the administrators, who have almost complete editorial control without any oversight. There's a reason why the editors of USA Today are above drinking age - it has to do with patience, experience, and the ability to lead people. The only administrators I see who have that aren't even very active here. My retired uncle, a former editor at the New York Post, is pretty shocked at the lack of objectivity on these pages. I don't blame him.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You say semantics, I say a revealing slip of language.</dd>
<dd>The difference between what you did and what Crumbsucker et al. did is this: they are established Wikipedia editors who, as far as I can tell, hadn't really interacted with one another before. There was no recruiting going on, and the reason they were "collaborating against" you because you refused to discuss the dispute any further on the talk page, instead relying on friends or extra IPs to get your preferred version in. They were a group of editors interested in maintaining Wikipedia's standards of neutrality and verifiability. You were a group of editors looking to force your point-of-view on a single article, objections be damned.</dd>
<dd>You talk about maturity, leadership, etc., as though these are qualities you have in abundance, and that your perceived opponents lack. I don't see it that way. Making petty personal attacks <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Android79&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=42357680" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Android79&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=42357680" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, using a ridiculous signature declaring yourself the Wikipedia "policeman", and refusing to follow basic standards of community etiquette are not marks of maturity.</dd>
<dd>There are plenty of venues to which you can bring your grievances. The <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">administrator's noticeboard</a> is one; <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">requests for comment</a> is another.

<dd>I would use the administrator's noticeboard if it actually worked. What's really ridiculous is your claim that the administrators are impartial. They deleted my complaint of my page being vandalized. Your "established" editors are doing nothing but reverts - I, along with people <i>not</i> reverting, are the only contributors adding useful information. I've had to go back and re-insert data your established editors deleted without even looking at (wiki links, updated box office numbers, actor/actress names, etc).

<p>It looks like Cecropia speedily deleted it. I reverted it because both an incomplete AFD and a PROD were placed there by an anonymous IP, which is pretty unusual. I may have been too quick with the rollback button on that one, but I generally distrust anything from an anonymous IP when it comes to deletion proposals. –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdashiel_664f.html" title="User talk:Adashiel">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 17:22, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you for teaching me about the 3RR. I did not know that one. I have not violated it and will try not to. I am, of course, reverting the blanking done by one user who is blanking without discussion. I think you would agree that blanking is an act of vandalism, so citing the act as vandalism is not attacking someone. <a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPoolGuy_fbb1.html" title="User:PoolGuy">PoolGuy</a> 17:49, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I believe I misunderstood the 3RR rule. I checked the page history and saw that I had reverted the page blanker's edits twice on March 14. I comfortably reverted a third time believing that it would not be a violation of the rule. Now after rereading the rule, I see that it was for more than three reverts of the blanking in a rolling 24 hour period, not just the Wikiday. I did not intend to violate that rule. Sorry. I will make sure that I fix blanking on a less frequent basis for the pages that I watch. <a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPoolGuy_fbb1.html" title="User:PoolGuy">PoolGuy</a> 05:02, 16 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, you now seem to understand the rule, but not what it's supposed to prevent. If you intend to continue your edit war against consensus, I'll just protect the page. You need to work out your dispute on the talk page. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color:#072764">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color:#c6011f">79</span></a> 05:03, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>It's not a generalization, in my country 12% of the population are [removed], yet 44% of the prison population (almost 4 times) are [removed]. Futhermore the stereotypical black culture today (demonstrated by the screenshot of that crime game), is to idolize criminals "rappers".</p>

<p>Hi - no, it was intentional. Perhaps I'm not aware of as full of a context as are you but it did seem like userpage vandalism, as much as I agree with you on the (assumed) intent of your edit. After a reading of <a href="../../../u/p/_/WP%7EUP_7462.html" title="WP:UP">WP:UP</a> I decided to revert the edit. Please notice that I also reverted <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheEmoEater_f1f6.html" title="User:TheEmoEater">TheEmoEater</a>'s edit to your userpage. In general the policy seems to be not to edit userpages without permission, especially if it markedly changes the tone or content (i.e. not a spelling/grammar fix). — <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlamingspinach_395e.html" title="User:Flamingspinach">flamingspinach</a> | <a href="../../../f/l/a/User_talk%7EFlamingspinach_8436.html" title="User talk:Flamingspinach">(talk)</a> 19:55, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay, I'll agree with that.

<dd>Wikipedia actually has a guideline to assist Wikipedians, in order to promote Wikipedia matters such as elections. "Clean up your mess. For example, after engaging in cross-posting to promote some election, be sure to remove those cross-posts after the election is complete."</dd>

<dd>Claiming I am a spammer when I have followed a Wikipedia <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_cdad.html" title="Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines">Guideline</a> that has wide acceptance among editors and is considered a standard that all users should follow appears to me to be unfair.

<p>Hey, the copyright status of several of the images I've uploaded have been held in question. I'm sorry if I was violating copyright laws.. the webpages I found them on either stated or suggested (Although I'm sure the 'suggestions' are coming from my mind) that the images are free to use.. I'm just trying to help clean up baseball players' Wikis and give them the nice pages they deserve, but I'm not very experienced in Wiki editing. <a href="../../../a/d/m/User%7EAdmiralTreyDavid_08ae.html" title="User:AdmiralTreyDavid">AdmiralTreyDavid</a> 19:11, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>When in doubt, always assume that an image you find on the web is copyrighted. I know it really sucks that we can't use all these nice photos of ballplayers on Wikipedia, but there are other ways we can improve the encyclopedia's articles on ballplayers.

<p>Hi, Android79. Just wanted to say that this AfD has taxed my patience to the limit. Are they always like this? There have been 3 bad ones today, but this is the worst I've experienced in my short time on Wikipedia, with The Hypermodernity Club running a close second. Just wanted to vent, so I thought I'd do it on your userpage and say hi while I was at it. <a href="../../../s/l/o/User%7ESlowmover_6914.html" title="User:Slowmover">Slowmover</a> 21:30, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, AfD can get like this occasionally, which is why I don't participate in them much anymore, favoring <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">proposed deletion</a> instead. Unfortunately, since this Will guy disputed my PROD nomination, I was forced to bring it to AfD. Feel free to vent (or bring any other problems you may have) here anytime. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color:#072764">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color:#c6011f">79</span></a> 22:21, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
