<p>I put quotation marks on "lifetime ban" because I clearly recall seeing Dice on <a href="../../../m/t/v/MTV_b498.html" title="MTV">MTV</a> in at least one subsequent appearance with David Spade. Spade played his trademark receptionist character who refused to allow Dice into the <a href="../../../m/t/v/MTV_Video_Music_Awards_95e6.html" title="MTV Video Music Awards">MTV Video Music Awards</a>, citing the "lifetime ban." However, by appearing on the network the "lifetime ban" was clearly not taken very seriously. I suspect he has appeared in other segments but that's the only one I've ever seen. --<a href="../../../f/e/i/User%7EFeitclub_dad9.html" title="User:Feitclub">Feitclub</a> 22:11, Jan 28, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There's also nothing but a parting mention in here about the incident in question, and the page 'Notable incidents on the MTV awards' or some such also lacks much information. Someone should put some more information about that in here; considering I only heard of Andrew Dice Clay today (and am curious about the incident), I'm not the one best suited to do it. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolarisSLBM_348e.html" title="User:PolarisSLBM">PolarisSLBM</a> 02:51, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article de-emphasizes Clay's links with traditional Jewish-American comedians who came out of the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catskills.html" title="Catskills">Catskills</a> circuit, such as <a href="../../../r/o/d/Rodney_Dangerfield_f74b.html" title="Rodney Dangerfield">Rodney Dangerfield</a> and <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddy_Hackett_e5d4.html" title="Buddy Hackett">Buddy Hackett</a>, many of whom were quite obscene in their live performances. Clay's debt to this tradition is rather clear&#160;; rather than a transgressive comedian like Kinison or Hicks, Clay's style of comedy was just a more extreme form of conventional stand-up styles of the sort mentioned above. <a href="../../../p/r/a/Prairie_Dog_c30e.html" title="Prairie Dog">Prairie Dog</a></p>

<p>There's been some back and forth editing on the exact wording of Dice's Mother Goose routines, which is somewhat futile, given that different performances and recordings have slightly different wordings. I just reverted some edits based on a quick listen of the first "Mother Goose" track from his first album, thinking that any later performances would be derivitave of that work.</p>
<p>Saying that, I'm not sure if the rhymes even belong in this article, as opposed to another article. And I'm not sure they belong on Wikipedia at all, given that they are copyrighted work, and it would be akin to posting lyrics to a copyrighted song. But, to about 99% of the people out there, these rhymes are the only identifiable part of his career, so maybe they should stay. I'm open to discussion on this, although I'm not sure anyone else cares that much. <a href="../../../j/k/o/User%7EJkonrath_759d.html" title="User:Jkonrath">Jkonrath</a> 15:51, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

If we take all but 2 or 3, it will better maintain the flow of the article. --THollan 02:28, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was disappointed to see this article discussing his shortcomings without really mentioning how popular he was at his peak. Its mentioned only in passing that he sold out Madison Garden three times, and that comes in a sentence that calls him a hack and attributes his success to Opie and Anthony. At his peak, Clay reached heights that no comedian before or after has reached.</p>
<p>This article criticizes his comic style and documents his failures in great detail, but it's failure to document his successes leaves us with an incomplete and misleading entry. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnson2995_78a9.html" title="User:Anson2995">Anson2995</a> 22:03, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have to agree. Despite their subsequent falling out with eachother, Dice still owes a great deal to the support of Opie &amp; Anthony during the last decade. They certainly deserve a mention for this in the main article.--24.47.145.73 17:28, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I cleaned up some of the commentary type POV. The comparison to Bruce, Kinison, and Hicks as social and political commentary is a POV.</p>
<p>Removed the word offensive from "offensive racist comments". This is POV as Clay's fans may not find it offensive but others will...POV.</p>
<p>After removing a couple POV entries, the article looks well balanced.

<p>I removed this text from the commercial failure section because it adds no new information and is obviously biased: "We also are subjected to a rant concerning the difficulty of spreading padded butter at a resturant. Dice perhaps gets his raciest, however, in the opening few minutes, when he vividly describes the process of cunt farting for the audience." First of all, we were not "subjected" to anything. Second, by calling it a rant, it makes him seem like a moron. Third, who gets to decide when he was raciest? Fourth, there has to be a better way to put it than to say cunt farting. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowbeckoner_72cc.html" title="User:Shadowbeckoner">shadowbeckoner</a></p>

<p>I was surprised to see it suggested that ADC began stand-up after Crime Story, in the late 1980s. I remember him appearing at the Comedy Store just south of Westwood (by UCLA) in the late 1970s or early 1980s, with exactly the same act, smoking the cigarette and the whole bit. I remember seeing him, myself, one night, on the bill with Yakov Smirnoff, a walk-on from Rich Hall, and the only guy to get any real laughs that night, the closer, the screamer, Sam Kinnison. Hall was grindingly boring. Smirnoff got a few giggles about how it was 'in Russia'. And ADC got barely even that. I personally didn't get his act, at the time. I wasn't laughing, either. By contrast, Kinnison's exasperated ranting about his wife, sort of Henny Youngman or Rodney Dangerfield on speed, to the point where he himself was on the floor had people almost rolling in the aisles, themselves; an appropriate cliche seeing him live.</p>

<p>"While doing a phone in to the Brother Weeze Show, to promote his new show, Dice said, "when he has a problem with someone, he takes care of business face to face." Then Opie from the Opie and Anthony Show comes on the phone to confront Dice, and Dice hangs up like a little girl."</p>
<p>I think we can all agree this should be removed... Not only of it's POV, but also because it's mentioned earlier, and in a non-pov way.

<dd>If you care enough to write on the discussion page then you should care enough to correct the main article. The lines you quoted demonstrate vandalism. They don't belong in an encyclopedia. I removed them along with tons of other claims in this article that were uncited. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> requires a higher standard. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/v/User_talk%7EVivaldi_d6d0.html" title="User talk:Vivaldi">talk</a>) 07:29, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I removed the sections with links to other pages. One of the refereneces (<a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Hunt_1e82.html" title="Mike Hunt">Mike Hunt</a>), was just vandalism. The link to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artie_Lange_fbc7.html" title="Artie Lange">Artie Lange</a> isn't really relevant since the content about the Dice/Lange feud was removed. The link to <a href="../../../o/p/i/Opie_and_Anthony_2c23.html" title="Opie and Anthony">Opie and Anthony</a> isn't needed since it already appears earlier in the article. And as an aside, I think this article benefits greatly by omitting all of the detailed commentary on "feuds" between Dice and various radio hosts. It's not notable and frankly a rather routine part of the radio business. Play-by-play accounts of those sorts of thing are fun for fansites, but they only serve to clutter an article like this one. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnson2995_78a9.html" title="User:Anson2995">Anson2995</a> 01:50, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
