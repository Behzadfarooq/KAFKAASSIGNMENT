<p>Hi, you may be inexperienced, or something, and I certainly don't want to take a heavy approach, but please understand that it is quite out of the question to nominate for deletion an article on a major subject. Articles can be deleted because they are non-notable — for example, an article about your French teacher at school. But there is no way that the Christianity article would be deleted. If there are problems with the article, please try to fix them — especially by using the talk page and collaborating with other editors. Nominating for deletion an article on a major subject (Mozart, Shakespeare, Christianity, Germany, etc.) is likely to be seen as trolling or even as vandalism, and might put you at risk of being blocked for disruption if you continued to do so. Thanks. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 23:37, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

You are a coward to edit my stuff when I am blocked. I request that someone who is not angry to help me out and revert my page before "JKelly" messed it up. Oh and one final note, you, JKelly, are a hypocrit.

<p>I note that you've replaced your unblock request, arguing that you have been blocked for "your beliefs". I'm not going to remove the tag again, but I don't recommend continuously replacing it. You haven't been blocked for your beliefs, you've been blocked because you were being disruptive. Pretty much all of your editing activity today has revolved around nominating <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> for deletion and advertising your doing so. That's not helping to build an encyclopedia. Even if you thought that nominating articles that you think are POV for deletion was the right thing to do, and even if you thought that uploading a lot of images you found on the web and claiming that they were public domain is okay, your behaviour after you were told it wasn't was still disruptive. What exactly did you expect would happen, other than having the site's administrators revoke your editing priveleges? <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 01:40, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First off, the images: look when those Images were posted. I was somewhat new to the whole ordeal. Dont blame me for it now. Second, todays incident, I stand behind fully. The only part I regret is spamming the 3 talk pages I spammed. Other than that, I refuse to agree that I did anything wrong, or that I should be blocked for it. As for the spamming: look at my contribs. Today was the only day in the history of my existance to get involved in spamming. Doesnt that require warning before ban?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the end, I took it too far with the spam, but I had every right to do the other tagging. Surely, some admin out there who is a 3rd party (one who hasnt banned me or you, JKelly) would agree that I should not be banned. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndy5190_62e2.html" title="User:Andy5190">Andy Blak</a> 02:12, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not Christian.

<p>I don't know if you have it watched, but there is consensus from three admins that would allow the userpage to be unprotected if given a guarantee that you would not replace the image with another unfree image.

<dd>I did, and thats why I'm trying to take a personal hand in this as it seems we're all getting off on the wrong foot. I'll go unprotect the page, and make the note at WP:PP. I'm going to be out of the office for a bit after this, but if you need to contact me you can do so here or on my talk page and we'll see if we can help turn this around. <a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 19:28, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
