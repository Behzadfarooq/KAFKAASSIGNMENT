	    <p><b>Andreas Grassl</b> (born <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_25.html" title="October 25">October 25</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>) is a <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">German</a> man found in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> in April 2005, who remained unidentified for a long time due to his refusal to speak, communicating instead through drawing and playing the <a href="../../../p/i/a/Piano.html" title="Piano">piano</a>. During the more than four months that passed until he revealed his identity, the mysterious story spawned media attention and speculation across the world, dubbing him the <b>Piano Man</b>.</p>
<p>When Grassl was picked up by <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police.html" title="Police">police</a> on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_7.html" title="April 7">April 7</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, he was wandering the streets in <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheerness.html" title="Sheerness">Sheerness</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kent.html" title="Kent">Kent</a>, in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, wearing a soaking wet suit and tie, and he did not answer any questions. Remaining silent, he was presented a pen and paper by <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medway.html" title="Medway">Medway</a> Maritime Hospital staff in the hope he would write his name. Instead, he drew a detailed sketch of a <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_piano.html" title="Grand piano">grand piano</a>. When they first brought him to a piano, he reportedly played music from various genres (ranging from <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_classical_music.html" title="European classical music">classical music</a> by <a href="../../../p/y/o/Pyotr_Ilyich_Tchaikovsky_36db.html" title="Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky">Tchaikovsky</a> to <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_music.html" title="Pop music">pop</a> by <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a>) non-stop for four hours, and then was taken away by the hospital staff.</p>

<p>For several months, Grassl was interned in a secure mental health unit in north Kent while he was being treated and evaluated. <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interpreting.html" title="Interpreting">Interpreters</a> were brought in, to find out if he was from Eastern Europe, but to no avail. <a href="../../../o/r/c/Orchestra.html" title="Orchestra">Orchestras</a> around Europe were contacted in a bid to trace his identity.</p>

<p>Grassl's picture was posted on the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Missing_Persons_Helpline_4c65.html" title="National Missing Persons Helpline">National Missing Persons Helpline</a> (NMPH) website <a href="http://www.missingpersons.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.missingpersons.org" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_18.html" title="May 18">May 18</a>, 2005, a <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Polish</a> man working as a <a href="../../../m/i/m/Mime_artist.html" title="Mime artist">mime artist</a> in <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a>, <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a> approached Italian police officers, believing the Piano Man to be a <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">French</a> <a href="../../../b/u/s/Busker.html" title="Busker">busker</a> called Steven Villa Masson. However, the British newspaper <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Independent_de8a.html" title="The Independent">The Independent</a></i> tracked down Masson to his home in France, thus ruling out this lead.</p>
<p>Italian television stations showed footage of a <a href="../../../p/i/a/Pianist.html#Classical_pianists" title="Pianist">concert pianist</a> with a resemblance to the Piano Man â€” the pictures were filmed at an instrument fair in <a href="../../../r/i/m/Rimini.html" title="Rimini">Rimini</a> five years earlier. Observers found his hair different, but his nose and facial structure very similar. He also stayed silent. British <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tabloids.html" title="Tabloids">tabloids</a> also suggested a link to a man last seen in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> two years ago, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Staufen_f9d3.html" title="Philip Staufen">Philip Staufen</a>, who wandered into a <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto%2C_Canada_bc6f.html" title="Toronto, Canada">Toronto</a> <a href="../../../e/m/e/Emergency_department.html" title="Emergency department">emergency department</a> apparently suffering from amnesia and later vanished, his true identity still unknown.</p>
<p>BBC News reported on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_29.html" title="May 29">29 May</a> 2005 that a <a href="../../../c/z/e/Czech_Republic_12a4.html" title="Czech Republic">Czech</a> musician called Klaudius KryÅ¡pÃ­n, the drummer of a famous Czech rock band <i>PraÅ¾skÃ½ vÃ½bÄ›r</i> ("Prague Selection"), had rung the helpline, offering information that Piano Man may be a pianist called TomÃ¡Å¡ Strnad, who along with Mr KryÅ¡pÃ­n was a member of the tribute band <i>Ropotamo</i> in the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>. Despite not having seen him for nine years, Mr KryÅ¡pÃ­n was quoted as saying "When I saw the picture in the newspapers, I knew it was TomÃ¡Å¡". Also, Klaudius KryÅ¡pÃ­n's twin brother Richard who lives in <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbus%2C_Ohio_64f3.html" title="Columbus, Ohio">Columbus, Ohio</a> confirmed that Piano Man has a striking resemblance to Mr Strnad. Another person who argued that Strnad may have been Piano Man was Michael KocÃ¡b, the singer of <i>PraÅ¾skÃ½ vÃ½bÄ›r</i> and a former adviser of <a href="../../../v/%C3%A1/c/V%C3%A1clav_Havel_1e7e.html" title="VÃ¡clav Havel">VÃ¡clav Havel</a>. A problem with this theory was that KocÃ¡b argued that he met Strnad on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_10.html" title="April 10">10 April</a>, 2005 near Prague (three days after Piano Man was found in England). Even though the West Kent NHS Trust described this as a "promising lead" and reportedly planned to bring in a Czech interpreter, this theory (like the theory that it was Steven Villa Masson, above) was dashed when TomÃ¡Å¡ Strnad was found and interviewed on Czech TV.</p>

Steffensen had not seen her husband since February, when he had travelled to Algeria to visit his sick mother. "He has lost 20 kilos and bleached his hair, but I can see in his eyes that it is him. I will never be wrong when I see those eyes", she said to TV 2/Lorry. Steffensen's theory was that her husband had travelled to England due to a conflict with his family. According to Steffensen the family was unhappy with the fact that he was married to a western woman. "I think he has fled for his life. He has previously received death threats," said Steffensen. She went to England to meet her claimed husband, but according to Steffensen, the hospital did not allow her to meet him.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andreas_Grassl_0623.html" title="Edit section: July">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">July</span></h3>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_2.html" title="July 2">July 2</a>, 2005, BBC News reported that the Piano Man, when shown a map, pointed to <a href="../../../o/s/l/Oslo.html" title="Oslo">Oslo</a>, the capital of <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norway.html" title="Norway">Norway</a>. A <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norwegian_language.html" title="Norwegian language">Norwegian</a> speaking person was brought in to open communications. According to the report the Piano Man seemed more responsive when Norwegian was spoken even though he remained unable or unwilling to speak. The theory was further strengthened by claims that a Norwegian <a href="../../../s/h/i/Ship.html" title="Ship">vessel</a> was in the area at the time the man was discovered.</p>
<p>According to media reports, the Piano Man also made a drawing of the <a href="../../../s/w/e/Swedish_flag.html" title="Swedish flag">Swedish flag</a> after coming to the hospital. This led to speculation that he had lived in one of the <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scandinavia.html" title="Scandinavia">Scandinavian</a> countries.</p>
<p>Between <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_4.html" title="July 4">July 4</a> and <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_6.html" title="July 6">July 6</a>, students from Norway said they knew the man in question as an exchange student from <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>. These beliefs and possible leads were dashed when Norwegian papers were able to contact the man who the Piano Man was thought to be.</p>

<p>On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_8.html" title="August 8">August 8</a> <i>The Independent</i> quoted a source at the West Kent trust expressing skepticism that the origins of the Piano Man would ever be found. Diagnoses of his condition initially focused on <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder.html" title="Post-traumatic stress disorder">post-traumatic stress disorder</a> but it was at the time thought he might be an <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autistic_savant.html" title="Autistic savant">autistic savant</a>. Autistic savants can display extraordinary but highly specific talents, while at the same time remaining withdrawn or uncommunicative to the point of constant silence. The trust refused to officially comment on the young man's treatment beyond saying that his physical health remained good, but it was understood he was showing increasing signs of a rapport with a small number of trusted caregivers.</p>

<p>On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_22.html" title="August 22">August 22</a>, the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">British</a> tabloid newspaper <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Daily_Mirror_3a22.html" title="The Daily Mirror">The Mirror</a></i> reported that the Piano Man had finally broken his silence after more than four months, and that he had been exposed as a hoax. Additionally, the <i>Mirror'</i>s source claimed that he did not play the piano properly, but "just kept tapping one key continuously". Hospital staff have maintained that his abilities were not exaggerated.</p>
<p>The <i>Mirror</i> article claimed that the Piano Man had told the medical staff that he was a <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">German</a> <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay.html" title="Gay">gay man</a>, who had come to Britain on a <a href="../../../e/u/r/Eurostar.html" title="Eurostar">Eurostar</a> train after losing his job in Paris. According to the newspaper's source, the man claimed that he had been planning to commit suicide when he was discovered on the beach in Sheerness, that he did not talk to the police due to his distressed state, and that he then continued to act mute. The unnamed source also suggested that the Piano Man used to work with the mentally ill, and thus was able to mimic their behaviour, thereby fooling the hospital staff. According to the <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tabloid.html" title="Tabloid">tabloids</a>, he has been flown back to Germany where his father (a farmer) and his two sisters live.<a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=15882241&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=94762&amp;headline=piano-man-sham--name_page.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=15882241&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=94762&amp;headline=piano-man-sham--name_page.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>Later the same day the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> reported that the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_Office_%28Germany%29_7ea5.html" title="Foreign Office (Germany)">German foreign ministry</a> had confirmed that the man was a 20-year-old <a href="../../../b/a/v/Bavaria.html" title="Bavaria">Bavarian</a> who had flown home on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_20.html" title="August 20">August 20</a>. The German embassy in London confirmed that they had been contacted by the Little Brook Hospital, confirmed the man's identity and provided him with replacement travel documents. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/kent/4172662.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/kent/4172662.stm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>
<p>Following the media reports, the West Kent NHS and Social Care Trust issued a statement stating that the man was no longer in the care of the trust, that he had been "discharged from [their] care following a marked improvement in his condition", and that their "involvement with this man has now ceased and will not be resuming at any stage". The statement also expressed that no further information was to be released. <a href="http://www.kentandmedway.nhs.uk/whats_new/piano_man/statement_eleven.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.kentandmedway.nhs.uk/whats_new/piano_man/statement_eleven.asp" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>In a follow-up to the story on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_24.html" title="August 24">August 24</a>, <i>The Mirror</i> named the man as Andreas Grassl and published an interview<a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=15889182%26method=full%26siteid=94762%26headline=exclusive%2d%2dpiano%2dman%2ds%2ddad%2dtells%2dof%2dhis%2dson%2ds%2dmissing%2d4%2dmonths-name_page.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=15889182%26method=full%26siteid=94762%26headline=exclusive%2d%2dpiano%2dman%2ds%2ddad%2dtells%2dof%2dhis%2dson%2ds%2dmissing%2d4%2dmonths-name_page.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> with his parents, farmers in Prosdorf, a village close to <a href="../../../w/a/l/Waldm%C3%BCnchen.html" title="WaldmÃ¼nchen">WaldmÃ¼nchen</a> in the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Cham_%28district%29.html" title="Cham (district)">Cham</a> district of the <a href="../../../u/p/p/Upper_Palatinate_be56.html" title="Upper Palatinate">Upper Palatinate</a> in eastern <a href="../../../b/a/v/Bavaria.html" title="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>. According to the interview, their son had upon his return told them that he had "no idea what happened to me. I just suddenly woke up and realised who I was." Grassl's father expressed anger with some allegations made in the original <i>Mirror</i> article, in particular the suggestions that his son's behavior during treatment was not genuine. "I know he would never make something like this up," the father said. He denied that his son is <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay.html" title="Gay">gay</a>, and told the newspaper that his son in fact is an accomplished piano player, albeit not of a professional degree. Grassl's lawyer said he may have experienced a <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychosis.html" title="Psychosis">psychotic episode</a>. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/4182926.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/4182926.stm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></p>
<p>After working with disabled people in <a href="../../../s/a/a/Saarbr%C3%BCcken.html" title="SaarbrÃ¼cken">SaarbrÃ¼cken</a>, Grassl apparently told his parents that he intended to leave to study in <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>. After that, his parents had not been able to reach him. They had reported him missing, but they did not see or recognise the pictures of their son that were distributed around the world.</p>
<p>Friends of Andreas Grassl told <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Times_47ca.html" title="The Times">The Times</a></i> that he'd spent hours in <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">internet</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chat_room.html" title="Chat room">chat rooms</a>, where he was known as "Scatman", and that he was a <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columnist.html" title="Columnist">columnist</a> for a local newspaper, writing about <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_music.html" title="Pop music">pop music</a>. <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1748128,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1748128,00.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></p>
