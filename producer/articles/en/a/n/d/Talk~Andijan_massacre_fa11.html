<p>On the main page, the first point on the news claims <i>Uzbek troops kill over 300</i> but on the article it is <i>perhaps 300</i>, this means the actual number is unknown, just estimated. It disturbs me because lies and false claims to fix impact on a title, are for the news media not for <b>Wikipedia</b> <i>The Free Encyclopedia</i> <a href="../../../m/e/x/User%7EMexaguil_283b.html" title="User:Mexaguil">Mexaguil</a> 07:42, 15 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Many other news sources (just check Google news) are reporting at least 500 dead. --<a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerkut_1f38.html" title="User:Berkut">Berkut</a> 08:44, 15 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>that re-enforces my point, my point is: wikipedia should not fall into the trap that news media does and have vague claims <a href="../../../m/e/x/User%7EMexaguil_283b.html" title="User:Mexaguil">Mexaguil</a> 10:32, 15 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The reason why claims are vague is because it's very difficult to get factual information on this: reporters were forced out of places where confrontations occured, the government does not release true counts, hospitals release no numbers at all, and so on. In any case Wikipedia <i>has</i> to relly on "news media" simply because wiki doesn't have a reporter in every place on Earth to bring factual info. --<a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerkut_1f38.html" title="User:Berkut">Berkut</a> 11:23, 15 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>You are both right, which is why "X is true" in a case like this should be "x is true" says (reference) preferably as an exact quote preferably linking to an internet source. 4.250.201.173 14:21, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've seen several media outlets in Norway who've started operating with (estimated) figures up in the 1000 to 2000 dead civillians. Nothing confirmed, naturally, but I'm upping the maximum estimated bit in the article intro to 1000 based on this. Also, I've seen a quote where the Uzbek government admits to having killed 160-something "militant extremists" several days after the massacre, despite sources in the army saying "at least 500". I can't find sources for any of these, though, as I mean to have picked them up from the text-TV of Norwegian NRK and TV2... so I'll just leave it in here, for now.--TVPR 07:43, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>What do you mean "anti-Uzbek"? Don't you realize that it is because of a few very brave Uzbeks (many of whom are wanted by their government now) that we have any of this information at all? When you say "anti-Uzbek" pov, you mean "anti-Karimov Regime".</p>

<p>The previous introduction was confusing in chronology and also introduced ancillary issues that occured after the events of May 13th. The "Islamic state" portion, for example, was an isolated incident that occured afterwards and had marginal connection to the intent of the original protestors. Hope this clarifies the topic.<br />

<p>The consensus among Central Asian experts is that this was an inter-clan conflict between the Interior Ministry and the clan running the police department of Andijan.

<li>Who are these "Central Asian experts" to whom you refer? The only citation you provide (above) does not mention the Samarqand Inoyatov clan, the Almatov Interior Ministry clan, or back up any of the claims you make. Until real citations are provided, these statements violate <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>.</li>
<li>Check the article's edit history. You've used the phrase <i>If you are unfamiliar with this event then please refrain from making controversial changes to this article, much less editing it at all</i> to justify unilateral edits.

<li>And yes, you unilaterally moved the article without even a peep of discussion. This is grossly inappropriate.</li>

<dd>The article I provided clearly states that it was an inter-clan conflict. The role of the clans in the conflict is irrelevant to the page title. If you opposed the page move it is odd that you did not note this move until now. Can you provide recent citation indicating this was not a clan conflict? <a href="../../../k/a/z/User%7EKazakhPol_c9da.html" title="User:KazakhPol">KazakhPol</a> 03:10, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Untrue. Your citation refers to a "local power struggle" in the opening sentence, but in no way mentions inter-clan conflict, much less the Samarqant Inoyatov clan or any other of your claims.</li>
<li>Yes, this page fell off my radar, then my life got busy. This does not justify an unilateral move without discussion.</li>
<li>First of all, the burden of proof is one YOU, since you're the only one bringing up the inter-clan conflict. Secondly, the <a href="http://hrw.org/reports/2005/uzbekistan0605/2.htm#_Toc105632740|" class="external text" title="http://hrw.org/reports/2005/uzbekistan0605/2.htm#_Toc105632740|" rel="nofollow">Human Rights Watch</a>article clearly implicates the government in the affair.</li>

<li>Yes, the HRW watch implicates the government. This is part of <i>my point</i>. The clans are based on government positions.</li>
<li>"Thus, for example, the Samarqand regional elite compete with the Tashkent and Ferghana groupings, or devotees of Rustam Inoyatov, head of Uzbekistan's National Security Service, unite against supporters of Zakir Almatov, Uzbekistan's former Interior Minister, so as to win the center’s attention and material largesse."<a href="http://66.218.69.11/search/cache?p=Andijan+inter-clan&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=yfp-t-501&amp;x=wrt&amp;u=www.nbr.org/programs/eurasia/McGlinchey.pdf&amp;w=andijan+inter+clan+clans&amp;d=b-Kz6RIeOUxX&amp;icp=1&amp;.intl=us" class="external autonumber" title="http://66.218.69.11/search/cache?p=Andijan+inter-clan&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=yfp-t-501&amp;x=wrt&amp;u=www.nbr.org/programs/eurasia/McGlinchey.pdf&amp;w=andijan+inter+clan+clans&amp;d=b-Kz6RIeOUxX&amp;icp=1&amp;.intl=us" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></li>
<li>If you do Crtl+F on the first source I provided searching under "clan" you will see: <i>Karimov personally attended the legislative session on May 25, 2004, during which Obidov was sacked. "The whole city was cordoned off by the militia and there were [security officers] in masks in jeeps, along with army soldiers," the source said. "Karimov was obviously worried. ... Obidov had ruled [in the region] for a long time: he was <b>part of the Ferghana clan</b> and he had lots of supporters." The new hokim, Begaliyev, had close political ties to the central government. Prior to coming to Andijan, Begaliyev had served as minister of agriculture and water. In late 2004, Karimov appointed Begaliyev’s successor as agriculture and water minister, Ikromkhon Nazhmiddinov, as the governor of Ferghana Province. The moves suggest that Karimov was intent during the last half of 2004 on boosting his political influence over the restive Ferghana Valley. Once installed in Andijan, Begaliyev wasted little time in launching a purge of all Obidov allies. "Criminal proceedings were started against many of his [Obidov’s] administration members," the source said. "The new hokim also decided to re-divide the businesses in the province; he cracked down on the entrepreneurs who had been supported by Obidov. They were told to sell their businesses for a pittance either to him [Begaliyev] or his people, or face legal proceedings." When the <b>23 businessmen</b> tried to resist, the hokim ordered their arrest, the source said. They were officially charged with being members of Akromiya, and engaging in extremist activities."</i> So you see, while the national government put down the businessmen and their allies, it was not based on a desire to repress the people but one clan's desire to take power from another. <a href="../../../k/a/z/User%7EKazakhPol_c9da.html" title="User:KazakhPol">KazakhPol</a> 03:29, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think the conversation is getting a bit muddled at this point. Regardless of the motivation or the local government's tribal affiliations, the point remains that government forces cordoned off protesters and killed hundreds, if not thousands of civilians. There was definitely "civil unrest" preceding and following the event, but the event itself definitely qualifies as a massacre. <a href="../../../d/j/m/User%7EDjma12_465a.html" title="User:Djma12">Djma12</a> 03:46, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>OK, KazakhPolice you have altered the title of this article, now you want to change it entirely by saying that the entire event was a clash between two terrorists clans?! Please see numerous pages some already listed on the article, about the event. The human rights organizations are far more credible than few Russian newspapers. Note that the governments of Russia and Uzbekistan have very close ties. Now the human rights organizations say that the civilians were protesting when government officials surrounded and killed them. The government says that it was terrorists, that is what you expect them to say, they won't confess, and Russian government will support them since they are allies. US used to be allies with Uzbekistan, but when US officials started criticizing Karimov's actions, and requesting foreign investigations, Uzbekistan ended all its relations with US. This is all already listed in the reference links, or you can google Andijan Massacre, and you'll find vast amount of more of these links. All western countries say it was a massacre done by government, Russia, China, and Central Asian Countries(all of them have close ties, and this is all referenced ) say that it was terrorists, and that it was you are saying too. That's all I want to say for now. If you need further references of what I said, I'll force myself, to google for you.

<li>I strongly oppose adding the terrrorism category based not only on government allegations, regional newsreports, but also on similar policy making, lobbying, watching organizations. If there should be citations on a subject where more than 700 hundred civilians were killed, they should be strictly academic, peer reviewed and or well-known international news organizations.<a href="../../../c/s/_/User%7ECs_49aa.html" title="User:Cs">cs</a> 14:10, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I would oppose adding the "terrorism" category, and support moving the article to "Andijan Massacre", the title by which this event is generally known, and an accurate description of what happened, whether you believe it was the Government or the insurgents who did most of the killing. For those who think this is simply a case of a "terrorist attack" being suppressed by the Uzbek Government, I suggest you look at this video of Babur Square before the massacre took place, taken by one of the participants (I posted the link on the main page a while back). There is also a comment piece from the New York Times:</li>

</ul>
<p>I've watched the whole thing a couple of times and broadly speaking I agree with the NYT’s assessment. Like the shorter version the Uzbek Government released six months before, this shows that the protests in Andijan began with a violent uprising, possibly (though not necessarily) religiously inspired. This longer video actually helps to undermine the weaker portions of the Uzbek Government’s case though. It clearly shows a crowd of hundreds, many women and children, almost all unarmed. There is no evidence to show that they were rounded up by force and used as a human shield: the only hostages shown are <i>militsiya</i> being herded into the <i>Hukumat</i> building. That said, the militants must have had some idea that these people would be in danger - but it doesn’t sound as if they were given any chance to disperse by the troops before they opened fire. I just don’t understand why the Uzbek Government released this video, in this form (It was handed over by the distinguished Uzbek scholar Bakhtiyar Babajanov to Martha Olcott at a Carnegie Foundation meeting, and he seems to have been authorised to do this). Had the Uzbek regime published the footage in full, without editing or subtitles, but with a full transcript, in the immediate aftermath of the massacre, they might have received some plaudits for openness and taken the heat out of demands for an enquiry. Had they suppressed it altogether they could have kept us guessing, or at least reliant on the statements of eyewitnesses which they could deny, however unconvincingly. They could even have cut it a lot more drastically than they did. Instead they’ve sat on it for a year, in which time they could have doctored the footage in any manner they chose. They’ve edited it crudely, removed any footage of people actually being killed by Government troops, and provided subtitles for those bits of dialogue they want highlighted (every single cry of “Allahu Akbar”, in other words). But they’ve left the rest of the soundtrack in, without subtitles, but perfectly comprehensible to anyone who knows Uzbek (I can only pick up the odd word). Thus, as Chivers and Wilensky-Langford observe, you can hear the crowd quite clearly yelling “Azadlik” (freedom) as well as “Allahu Akbar”. People make speeches denouncing economic hardship and unjust imprisonment. For all their attempts to suggest that these are dangerous militants of the kind we see marching in <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quetta.html" title="Quetta">Quetta</a> burning US flags, the atmosphere, with its cheers, clapping and whistles, sounds more like a pop concert half the time, made all the more poignant because we know what follows. What is shocking in some ways is the normality of it all, people smiling, chatting, waving, lying on the grass, talking on their mobile phones, smoking a fag, looking excited or bewildered, amongst the burning buildings, the slightly hysterical speeches and the appeals for calm. I suppose the intention of the film is to make foreigners feel scared of this crowd of people, hundreds of whom are about to die. In this it singularly fails. <a href="../../../s/i/k/User%7ESikandarji_ae16.html" title="User:Sikandarji">Sikandarji</a> 15:51, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>People, understand that you do not need to look for further "sources" that state that the event involved terrorists, since we already know (I'm am assuming that everyone knows) that there are two sides of the story: One is, of all human rights organizations(Including but not limited to HRW, UN), governments of Western countries (inc. US, UK, EU), and others, that say the Uzbek government killed civilian protesters, and is trying to cover it up by accusing terrorists, and not letting any foreign officials, or journalists, or anyone else to be involved. The second version is of Uzbek government and some of its close allies (Russia, China), that states that terrorists were behind all of it. So, if everyone, besides the Uzbek government and its allies, blame Uzbek government for the events, and clearly points out the fact that the terrorists weren't involved at all, why say in the article that terrorists were behind this? I think that people should stop debating a topic that is already clear, and move on to improve the article. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheColdTruth_bb09.html" title="User:TheColdTruth">TheColdTruth</a> 22:31, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, I think that the whole article needs to be rewritten, or at least restructured and cleaned, and put in a such way, that is neutral, and accurate, and states what governments of US, UK, and European Union, the human rights organizations, and others describe the event as. Then the article will point out that Uzbek government, however, denies that it massacred innocent civilians, and blamed the event on terrorists. The article, will still be focused on the West's description of the event. Then the article will state all the details of the event. Some of the other facts that should be in article are that, after being heavily criticized by the West, for its actions, the Uzbek government, ended its close ties with US, closing the US base in 2K, kicked out all the human rights organizations and independent media, refused to have third party investigations, and virtually locked out Uzbekistan to the West, and to the outside world. In turn the West, stopped it's fundings to, and other relation with Uzbekistan, and continues criticizing Uzbek government for poor human rights, and such.

<p><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheColdTruth_bb09.html" title="User:TheColdTruth">TheColdTruth</a>, thank you for the suggestions. Here are my thoughts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wiki coverage on international atrocities is especially difficult. One wishes to express the extent of outrage, but must keep in mind <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> at the same time. As such, I think quotations who's entire purpose is inflammatory should be omitted. However, it IS appropriate to include estimates on casualties, government actions, and methods of death / burial. Just keep in mind that these statements should be expressed in NPOV language.</li>
<li>Controversial articles have a much higher standard for citation. As such, I think only respected academic sources, international organizations, and reputable news agencies should be cited. (Keeping in mind point one as well.) John McCain is a notable individual, but he is not an academic, nor would he claim to be so.</li>
<li>Yes, I think the Uzbek government's presentation of events is specious, at best. However, for an article to remain NPOV, their arguments need to be presented. However, if you wish to provide counter-arguments to their claims, no one would be happier than I.</li>

<dd>? Your citation of WP:V is nonsensical. It has nothing to do with my point. I am arguing that McCain's statements merit inclusion.

<li>Sure, you're entitled to your opinion. However, that does not necessarily merit inclusion.

<li>There is no way McCain could represent American government. He is a senator and not a cabinet member. In fact, he represents <b>the Republican side of the opposition</b> to official American foreign policy in the senate. American official policy was ambarrassingly accomodating until it became certain that Khanabad would be closed no matter what.

<dd>Kazakpol, you know better. It is only a "theory." Central Asian "experts" talk about all kinds of things all the time. When they utter the magic word "clan" they think they explain everything. That is a legacy coming from the Soviet times. It is only a theory and a plausible explanation among others. To assert it as a "fact beyond dispute" is impossible at best, waste of time at worst. In my opinion, you can include it as an alternative explanation of what had happened. That is all to it. They also claimed that <s>Khamidov</s> Jurabekov organized the Tashkent bombings to eliminate Kerimov... They also claimed that Kerimov himself did the Tashkent bombings... These things will never end. We have to stick to what we can prove.<a href="../../../c/s/_/User%7ECs_49aa.html" title="User:Cs">cs</a> 00:10, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I dont think that we need to deal with their own entries, or question the organizations. Eurasia org and RFLRL are extensions of the American government. Are they independent as BBC? No. The citations here could be easily confirmed with independent reliable sources. The potential problem is, if we start citing them in this article, that will establish a precedent.

<p>Nobody until now questioned the causality of businessmen issue. That is the primary reason cited by the participants of the protests. Clan dispute is different. Was there any recorded slogan about the fired governor? Were the protestors shouting slogans in support of the fired governor showing signs that indeed was a part of the protests? Is there any reference to it in the countless interviews with the protestors, published so far?

<p>A short introduction should merely introduce the issues and the major POV dispute. The KazakhPol version fails NPOV by endorsing the government version only (and not even the current government version at that). Both versions go into too much detail for an introduction. Both fail to identify the permanent damage done to US-Uzbek relations because of Andijan.</p>

<p>I'd support most of that (and am very glad to see Adeeb Khalid's book cited - it's excellent). One thing I would say is that even before the massacre the Uzbek Government had been gradually distancing itself from its western allies, and I suspect the airbase at Khanabad would have been closed that year anyway. <a href="../../../s/i/k/User%7ESikandarji_ae16.html" title="User:Sikandarji">Sikandarji</a> 11:09, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Government Looses Control section is the most contradictory part, and since it is not cited, and it also has been established that the whole "terrorist" idea was Karimov's denial story (which he finally acknowledged as being false).

<dd>The outside-world consensus now seems to be that there was an armed and violent uprising on behalf of the arrested businessmen, that the jailbreak encouraged peaceful demonstrators, and that the army was indiscriminate in its response, but the armed protestors weren't particularly nice either and used hostages as human shields. This nuanced view (as available in the CEIP and CFR articles) is rather absent from the article, and next week I'll do a rewrite of the May 12-13 section to reflect it if someone else doesn't get to it first. -- <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedFrank_f8cb.html" title="User:TedFrank">TedFrank</a> 20:45, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Why are you reverting my removals of contradictions? Did you happen to take your time to see what had I edited before reverting? Before reverting anything, take a look at the section itself. It lists the prison take over happened on May 13th and then goes on saying it had happened on May 12th. The take over of the prison occured on May <i>12th</i> not 13th, that event encouraged people to finally to stand up against the poor conditions and corrupt government on May <i>13th</i>.

<p>One user, KazakhPol in particular(who is known for pushing everything-terrorism subjects and views), wants this article to be part of Terrorism Category. However, the only thing related to terrorism is that the Uzbek government, which has been established as being corrupt by the Western World, blamed the massacre on terrorists, at first. The whole article has nothing to do with terrorism, in addition the Uzbek government has acknowledged that the mass killing of protesters was done by them, all though they are saying it was the solely local government's fault. Besides KazakhPol does anyone find this article appropriate being in terrorism category? If not it will be removed from the category. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheColdTruth_bb09.html" title="User:TheColdTruth">TheColdTruth</a> 17:45, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>You both have already stated your desire to have this category removed. This is nothing new. You have no grounds to remove the category, the statement that the government acknowledged a mass killing is false, and you apparently have not read the guideline on <a href="../../../d/e/s/Category%7EDesignated_terrorist_organizations_0fc8.html" title="Category:Designated terrorist organizations">Category:Designated terrorist organizations</a> which clearly applies in this case. <a href="../../../k/a/z/User%7EKazakhPol_c9da.html" title="User:KazakhPol">KazakhPol</a> 20:15, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Exactly, this is not new. In fact everyone who has common sense will tell that this article doesn't have anything to do with terrorism , unless you <i>make</i> it part of terrorism, just like the Uzbek government. You have no grounds to put it in terrorism category and you need to take a look at your own link, to understand what terrorism is, and anyone with common sense will tell you, it clearly does not apply to this case. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheColdTruth_bb09.html" title="User:TheColdTruth">TheColdTruth</a> 23:25, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
