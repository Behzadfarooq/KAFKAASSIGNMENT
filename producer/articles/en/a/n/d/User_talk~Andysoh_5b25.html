	    <p>Hi - thanks for your note. I think your proposed changes look reasonable; they should preferably be accompanied by references. I used <a href="http://archive.workersliberty.org/publications/readings/trots/militant.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://archive.workersliberty.org/publications/readings/trots/militant.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> as my reference; it's pretty anti-<i>Militant</i>, but there's a fair bit of useful detail in there. Matgamna suggests that Taaffe was editor in name only for the first four issues, but you're quite right that that is not the same as stating that Taaffe was the second editor - which was an error on my part.</p>
<p>By the way, I've added a little more detail to the article on Protz; I suspect that it is <i>New Agenda</i> that you are confusing with <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Society_9b26.html" title="New Society">New Society</a></i>, which appears to have only had two editors until 1986 - although it's possible that Protz guest-edited it; apparently he guest edited <i><a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Out_dcb6.html" title="Time Out">Time Out</a></i> for a few weeks. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarofdreams_9458.html" title="User:Warofdreams">Warofdreams</a> <i><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarofdreams_f9b2.html" title="User talk:Warofdreams">talk</a></i> 01:58, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Thanks War of dreams! the reference you give, which does not really contradict my points, is really interesting also, if a bit poinsonous.</p>
<p>It assigns Peter Taaffe to National Scretary in 1965 when he moved down,with some plausibililty. This would be definitely worth entering into the biography.</p>
<p>Before seeing your post, I added a little extra information to my post on your page (I hope you didn;'t mind me posting there - wasn't really sure where was the best place.) THis consists of the evidence of the first issue of the Militant declaring clearly that Peter Taaffe is the editor.</p>
<p>I also added that the minutes are available. They are likely to be available in Manchester university with Jimmy Dean's archives. JImmy Dean was certainly present, so it is likely he made the minutes. Perhaps this can serve as the reference.</p>
<p>I don't intend to use this, but it might be worth adding it to the discussion in case people are unsure of the changes. Andysoh 11:04, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi - I've gone through the article. I hope it doesn't look too harsh; I've explained my edits on the talk page. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarofdreams_9458.html" title="User:Warofdreams">Warofdreams</a> <i><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarofdreams_f9b2.html" title="User talk:Warofdreams">talk</a></i> 00:15, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry for taking a while to get back to you; I'm pleased to see you've been working away on the article. I'm not too concerned which image is used; in general higher resolution images are preferred, but it's not overly significant. Your proposed wording on Matgamna's comment looks fine, except that I'd probably leave out the "highly critical" - though I'd agree that they are highly critical, it's not really relevant to that particular comment. On the balance of information on the party, I'd entirely agree that Taaffe's life is entwined with that of the tendency, and so there should be plenty of information on it - just that each fact should be clearly linked to Taaffe - for instance, if there's a reference which points out his specific responsibilities for Liverpool, that'd make it clear why Militant's activities in the city in the 80s are being discussed - whereas, if he had few links with the city, it'd make more sense to put in only the briefest of mentions as background and leave the detail for the article on Militant. The info on the talk page looks reasonably well sourced, but again I feel some it needs to be linked more closely to Taaffe to establish its relevance.

<p>Can you please take a look at the article <a href="../../../o/n/_/On_the_Edge_%28book%29_e30f.html" title="On the Edge (book)">On the Edge (book)</a>? See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=On_the_Edge_%28book%29&amp;diff=117209497&amp;oldid=117208608" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=On_the_Edge_%28book%29&amp;diff=117209497&amp;oldid=117208608" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, someone keeps removing info about the author's personal involvements with the groups they are writing about.</p>
<p>Hi, I personally think you have a point that if the author has not disclosed his own involvement with the groups he describes in this book, it is relevent at least to the criticism section of the article. And if he has said so, you can still make the point, becuase it is not just a question of disclosure, but that he has an intimate knowledge of the CWI. And I personally would not let go the slight of hand about where he says "even if they agree with the substantive points" becuase that is a bit misleading.</p>
<p>You will be aware that he says&#160;:</p>
<dl>
<dd>I WAS a member of the Committee for a Workers International (aka CWI, Militant Tendency or now the Socialist Party) in Ireland from 1974 to 1985. For six of those years I worked for it full time. After leaving, in circumstances that would be boringly familiar to those who have either studied or experienced the Trotskyist party building milieu, I became a full time student and then an academic. I am now a Professor of Communication at a Scottish university.</dd>

<p>in this article <a href="http://www.whatnextjournal.co.uk/Pages/Back/Wnext27/Intro.html" class="external free" title="http://www.whatnextjournal.co.uk/Pages/Back/Wnext27/Intro.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.whatnextjournal.co.uk/Pages/Back/Wnext27/Intro.html</a></p>
<p>You won't get very far without creating a wikipedia account, however, and then raising the matter briefly on the discussion page, with the aim of adding the information, and the reference, to the criticism section, making clear the point that this means that there is a case for arguing that he is not an impartial outsider, and that his own experiences are important. I would then wait a week or two to see if there are any objections before doing anything. Andysoh 10:03, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
