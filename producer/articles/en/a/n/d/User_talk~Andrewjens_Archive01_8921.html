<p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>When I said: "<i>The people arguing in favour of the link have a vested interest in its inclusion, therefore they are not objective when considering what a random reader wants and expects ...</i>". I didn't mean that people who are involved in the subject of an article shouldn't edit wikipedia and the articles they know about, if that were the case it would be a pretty crappy encyclopedia. People edit what they know and they usually have an interest in that. Particuarly with schools articles, because the only people who are going to edit them properly are old boys/girls. I have a vested interest in half of the articles I have created.</p>
<p>What I think is that anyone is free to edit anything, but when it comes to a dispute of content, whoever has an vested interest in an article shouldn't participate in the debate about whatever it is. This leads to problems such as the only people who are likely to be arguing for a particular point are those people and it may be really hard to find some neutral people and ask them to argue your point. That is probably one of the reasons why it isn't wikipedia policy, the other being that it is impossible to tell sometimes. So it is purely my opinion and not policy or anything. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrumpyyoungman01_91af.html" title="User:Grumpyyoungman01">Grumpyyoungman01</a> 00:14, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But the whole point that you have missed in this (Talk:Sydney_Technical_High_School) is that there was no discussion or debate. Enochlau just unilaterally and without Wikipedia-supported justification revised an edit and is now unwilling to listen to the debate supported by more than a dozen people.</dd>
<dd>I utterly reject your notion that "whoever has an (sic) vested interest in an article shouldn't participate in the debate...". Input into a debate must be taken on its merits - not its source.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewjens_f00d.html" title="User:Andrewjens">Andrew Jens</a></dd>

<dd>"<i>Input into a debate must be taken on its merits - not its source.</i>" Yeah you are probably right about this, I am just an authoritarian Nazi, or something. I withdraw that argument. I agree that there was little in the way of discussion, but Enochlau had heaps of support from admins and such for his position and action like that is about as Wikipedia sanctioned as you get, even if it is more of majoritarian rule than consensus. I think that you could still get the link included somehow in the body of the text if you used it as a reference for something which couldn't be found on the school or old boys website. If you are up against the odds you need to think creatively and subversively. -- <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrumpyyoungman01_91af.html" title="User:Grumpyyoungman01">Grumpyyoungman01</a> 08:04, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I held off replacing the external link for a long time. I was hoping that you'd demonstrate some common sense and decency - but no. The only way to bring the issue to a head is to force the pace a little. That is why I have now replace the link multiple times. Perhaps by exposing you to some outside scrutiny, you might get a little more life experience and become more flexible in your thinking.

<p>Yes, I know, you're probably sick of hearing about this, by now. <i>But.</i> I'm here to let you know that someone has requested that the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_9d17.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal">Mediation Cabal</a> attempt to calm down the situation. If you're not interested, feel free to disregard this message. If you are interested, I'll ask that you try to put any harsh feelings behind you, and remember that you and all of the editors around you are all trying to build the best Wikipedia possible; disagreements in how to do so shouldn't get in the way of our <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a> towards each other. We do encourage new users to <b><a href="../../../b/b/_/WP%7EBB_678a.html" title="WP:BB">be bold</a></b>, and I'm a firm believer of that philosophy. Wikipedia is, unfortunately, not particularly accessible to newcomers, and as beneficial new users are arguably our greatest resource, we would all <a href="../../../d/b/t/WP%7EDBTN_1b88.html" title="WP:DBTN">do well to remember</a> our "younger days" Likewise, I've known firsthand how tiresome it can get, reverting vandal after vandal -- over time, each new incident starts to develop this sense of <i>urgency</i>, and you get tired of having what seems to be the same discussion, over and over -- I also see that the admin in question has a bit of a history protecting this article in particular.</p>
<p>Now, the link in question does have some issues, for and against it; I find things to sympathize with and things to fault in all parties, here. For the time being, my interest is in calming things down. I would appreciate it if you (along with any other involved editors) would agree to set aside hard feelings in the pursuit of a better Wikipedia -- our reputation on an encyclopedia depends heavily on interactions between editors. All that much better if we can all agree to work side-by-side, and do so in a public, transparent forum for all to see. Let's try to make this a positive experience for everyone.</p>
<p>I have nothing but respect for your intelligence, and your contributions to Wikipedia. Thank you for the time you've taken to read my message, and any subsequent time you might put into this case.</p>
<p>The particular case page can be found <b><a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_Cases_2006-06-16_alumni_link_78f4.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Cases/2006-06-16 alumni link">here</a></b>. As you're probably aware, the cabal has no official authority, but in this case that may work to everyone's advantage. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin">Luna Santin</a> 17:11, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey, I just wanted to check up on you. I had the impression you were more than a bit upset over how things were handled, and actually being a relatively new user myself, I'm more than happy to lend an ear, if you'd like to talk. I may be able to give you some advice, but if you'd rather I just listen, that's perfectly alright.

<hr />
Please be <b>extremely careful</b> when adding material to articles or talk pages that it does not involve <b>defamation</b> (<i>if you don't know what defamation is, read <b><a href="../../../d/e/f/Defamation.html" title="Defamation">this</a></b></i>). Comments that defame an individual <b>may leave you open to being sued</b> by them. Your status here, whether as a signed-on user or as an anonymous IP, would not protect you. Someone you defame could get a court order instructing your server to supply your details to them. They could then sue you for damages. Remember, while Section 230 of the <i>United States <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communications_Decency_Act_d18c.html" title="Communications Decency Act">Communications Decency Act</a></i> protects Wikipedia from being sued for defamation, <b>it may not protect the person who posted a defamatory claim on a Wikipedia page</b>.<br />
<br />
<p>Furthermore, the Board of Wikipedia has ruled that: <b>Where the user has been vandalising articles or persistently behaving in a disruptive way, [personal information] data may be released to assist in the targeting of IP blocks, or to assist in the formulation of a complaint to relevant Internet Service Providers.</b> <i><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Privacy_policy" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Privacy_policy" rel="nofollow">(Full information on Wikipedia privacy policy here)</a></i><br />
<br />
<b>This box has been placed on your talk page because another Wikipedian suspects that, perhaps innocently, you may have defamed someone in your contributions.</b> Please recheck your edits. Do not make allegations against someone unless you have provided evidence from a reliable publication, and then make sure you describe the allegations in accordance with our content policies, particularly <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>.

Wikipedia requires reliable sources for all claims.<br />
<br />
<b>If you have defamed someone, you may be blocked without warning from editing Wikipedia.</b> If you find that you have inadvertently defamed someone in an article, do two things:<br />
1. Remove the defamation from the article <b>immediately</b>.<br />
2. Hit <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">this</a> link and leave a note on that page saying that you accidentally left defamatory claims in named article. (Don't repeat the claims. They will be able to see from your edit removing them what they were.) A developer will then delete the claim from the page history<br />

Once that is done, and the defamation is gone completely from our records, the problem should be solved.</div>

<dd>The point, Luna, is the repulsion I feel in reading the racial &amp; religiously vilifying views of a bigot such as Sumple (views which are self-confessed and unretracted). Note that many of his views are much more recent than 10 years ago (that was a lie by Sumple, which you fell for). In fact, it doesn’t take a moment to figure out that as they are on Sumple's personal pages (linked from Wikipedia, can you believe it), that they are his <i>current</i> views. He could log in to geocities and remove those pages in about five minutes (if he wanted to). The fact that some of his views have been present for up to a decade should be all the indication you need as to just how proud he is of his writings.</dd>
<dd>I gave Sumple fair opportunity to renounce his odious writings – something he chose not to do. Obviously he doesn’t wish to retract his offensive opinions.</dd>
<dd>Having seen that, Luna, it should be clear to you as to why it is critical that other Wikipedians be given fair warning about the sort of influences that might be present whenever Sumple begins to edit articles (in a neutral and encyclopedic medium such as Wikipedia). Remember that I'm not just warning the Wikipedian community of something petty or minor (say Sumple's problems with grammar). Sumple’s views are subject to the Racial Vilification Act 1996 (NSW), and I would hate to see articles in Wikipedia brought into disrepute on that basis.

<dd>Thing is, though, it really doesn't <i>matter</i> if you, I, or anybody else <i>likes</i> him or not -- so long as he contributes productively to Wikipedia, I don't see how his personal website is relevant. Are his edits helpful? Does he mind <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">the NPOV policy</a>, which should prevent his views from entering articles, whatever they might be? Is he able to work productively with other editors? Has anything on his website posed a problem for other editors before, in the course of creating and editing content for Wikipedia? Does he hunt down other editors' personal websites for the purpose of attacking them and starting flame wars? Would you have even looked at his personal page, if you hadn't been angry with him? Would you have ever known about his views, if you hadn't gone to his website? I'm not saying you have to like the guy, that's not my choice, or anyone else's but your own. But please, don't harass other users -- we should all do our best to work together, and build a better Wikipedia, and starting fights when we're frustrated doesn't seem like a step down the right path. Please reconsider, you seem very intelligent, and I'm sure you have valuable contributions to make, if that's what you want to do. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin">Luna Santin</a> 05:16, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Obviously it's against Wikipedian rules to utter a sentence in defence of oneself. Wikipedia's pseudo-elitism is very nasty.</dd>
<dd>My experience with Wikipedia has led me to be sympathetic to the point of view (as expressed by others) of Wikipedia being "the concensus of the uninformed". Please 'block' me for much longer than 24 hours. I'm going back to the real world.</dd>

<dd>Your actions on Sumple's talk page amount to an elaborate and premeditated personal attack. I am dumbfounded why you would do this when your content dispute involving him and other users was in mediation - and seemed to be proceeding fairly well as far as I can see. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin">Luna Santin</a>, whom I don't know, seems to be a very competent mediator. I have no opinion about the content dispute itself, but personal attacks are strictly forbidden here, and this was not like the usual sort of exasperated insult in the heat of the moment: you went to some trouble to investigate and "expose" Sumple, mock him, and attempt to destroy his credibility. That is not how we do things.</dd>

<dd>The 24-hour block was to stop you from being able to continue, as you were actually defending your indefensible actions (indeed, you have continued to do so on this page since I blocked you). I have no particular intention of increasing it at the moment, but you need to calm down, reflect on how you have acted, and understand why your action was a serious breach of our policies that all users must treat each other in a civil way at all times and refrain from attacks of a personal nature (whether or not they would meet the legal test for defamation). If you can't understand and accept that, then, yes, Wikipedia is not for you. If, on further reflection, you do want to stay here and make a positive contribution, then the best thing you could do would be to apologise to Sumple when your block runs out in a few hours, and see if other parties are prepared to return to the mediation process. It's really up to you. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 02:08, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Andrew, I support Meta's statement here, as a friend of yours. Please come back; your expertise is badly needed on WP. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony1_9951.html" title="User:Tony1">Tony</a> 02:36, 20 June 2006 (UTC) PS I think that we have to treat every WPian on face value <i>here</i>, for what he/she contributes; like a court of law, other information is ruled inadmissable, usually with good reason. There are just too many imponderables about the other texts that you've dug up for them to be relevant. I can say that without even having looked at them. I wouldn't bother. Now, you wouldn't rule out a journalist who's published harsh criticism of WP elsewhere from editing, would you? <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony1_9951.html" title="User:Tony1">Tony</a> 02:41, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
