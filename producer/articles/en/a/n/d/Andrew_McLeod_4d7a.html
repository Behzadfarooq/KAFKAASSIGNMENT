McLeod capped off a solid debut year for the Magpies with a Premiership medallion, bagging two goals in Port's 37-point win over Woodville-West Torrens in the 1994 SANFL Grand Final.</p>
<p>In 1995, McLeod was recruited by the newly established <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fremantle_Football_Club_702f.html" title="Fremantle Football Club">Fremantle Football Club</a> as part of their inaugural squad. However, Fremantle would later agree to exchange McLeod to the Adelaide Crows for promising forward <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Groom_ff06.html" title="Chris Groom">Chris Groom</a> in what many now consider to be one of the most lopsided trades in Australian rules football history.</p>
<p>In an interview with Australian men's magazine Alpha<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> in September 2005, McLeod would later reveal that he refused to play for Fremantle after feeling insulted and belittled by Fremantle coach <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerard_Neesham_47f5.html" title="Gerard Neesham">Gerard Neesham</a> who had not actually seen him play before.</p>

<p>In his first year with the Adelaide Crows, McLeod began his AFL career quietly, appearing tentative and nervous during pre-season games. However, in a round 9 match against <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawthorn_Football_Club_2b9f.html" title="Hawthorn Football Club">Hawthorn</a> at Football Park, a confident McLeod began to emerge. In the dying seconds of the game with Adelaide trailing by 4 points, McLeod raced into an open forward line while being hotly pursued by his opponent. Swooping onto the loose ball, he calmly laid it on his foot under pressure, dribbling it through for a miraculous goal from a tight angle at the Northern End of the ground to give his side a remarkable 2-point victory after they had trailed by 34 points at half-time.</p>
<p>McLeod would later be named as an AFL rising star nominee late in the 1995 season after a string of consistent performances in a struggling Adelaide side which only managed a 9-13 record.</p>

<p>After two tumultuous years under <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Shaw_af8d.html" title="Robert Shaw">Robert Shaw</a>, legendary footballer <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malcolm_Blight_3ec3.html" title="Malcolm Blight">Malcolm Blight</a> took over as coach of Adelaide. The Crows would begin the season slowly as they adjusted to Blight's long-kicking and direct style of football before claiming a finals berth for the first time since 1993.</p>
<p>In the preliminary final against the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Bulldogs_899a.html" title="Western Bulldogs">Western Bulldogs</a>, McLeod, who had been playing primarily as a forward or half-back flanker was placed into the midfield in the second half by Blight in an effort to spark the Crows side who trailed by 31 points at half-time. It would be the first time in McLeod's career that he would play in the middle and in a thrilling contest, McLeod and the Crows would win the match by 2 points to reach the Grand Final for the first time in the club's history.</p>
<p>In the Grand Final against <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Kilda_Saints_1934.html" title="St Kilda Saints">St. Kilda</a>, McLeod would take his first significant step in his journey towards joining the game's elite. Accumulating 31 disposals, he was best on ground against the Saints, winning the prestigious <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norm_Smith_Medal_7f49.html" title="Norm Smith Medal">Norm Smith Medal</a> while helping his team win the AFL premiership. This was followed shortly thereafter with a gold jacket when he was named as the Crows best and fairest for the 1997 season.</p>

<p>Having caught the eye of football followers with his magical feats in the 1997 finals, McLeod would continue to dazzle crowds with his pace and agility in 1998 before being named All-Australian for the season.</p>
<p>In a preliminary final rematch against the Bulldogs, McLeod would kick a career-high 7 goals while being opposed to <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Liberatore_b8b9.html" title="Tony Liberatore">Tony Liberatore</a> who was reputed to be the most ferocious tagger in the game at the time. In the following game, against Grand Final favourites, the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Melbourne_Football_Club_8dbc.html" title="North Melbourne Football Club">Kangaroos</a>, the Crows would win by 35 points with McLeod emulating his feats a year earlier. Gathering 30 disposals and winning back-to-back Norm Smith Medals, McLeod became the first player to win two Norm Smith Medals since <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Ayres_f3c3.html" title="Gary Ayres">Gary Ayres</a> in 1986 and 1988.</p>
<p><a name="2001"></a></p>

<p>McLeod had perhaps the finest season of his career in 2001. Having been made a permanent fixture in the Crows midfield by coach Gary Ayres, McLeod averaged a career-best 24.7 disposals <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>. He would win the <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leigh_Matthews_Trophy_fc2b.html" title="Leigh Matthews Trophy">Leigh Matthews Trophy</a> to be recognized as the <a href="../../../m/o/s/Most_Valuable_Player_9a8e.html" title="Most Valuable Player">Most Valuable Player</a> in the league as voted by his peers in the <a href="../../../a/f/l/AFL_Players_Association_f66b.html" title="AFL Players Association">AFL Players Association</a> as well as his second best and fairest award from the club.</p>
<p>McLeod, however, would be denied the AFL's greatest individual honour in the 2001 <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brownlow_Medal_2578.html" title="Brownlow Medal">Brownlow Medal</a>. Trailing by two votes in the last round to <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Akermanis_b2df.html" title="Jason Akermanis">Jason Akermanis</a> of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_Lions_4cd4.html" title="Brisbane Lions">Brisbane Lions</a>, many believed he would receive votes after amassing 37 disposals against Fremantle in the final round. Instead, the umpires decided not to award McLeod with any votes for the game leaving him stunned as he looked on while the medal was presented to the flamboyant Akermanis.</p>

<p>Having established himself as one of the league's premier players in 2001, McLeod had to contend with increasing attention and pressure from opposition players over the following seasons. Combined with various personal off-field problems, McLeod grew increasingly frustrated and struggled to recapture his best form. However, he was still able to provide sporadic bursts of brilliance, as seen when he was awarded the 2003 Michael Tuck Medal for being best on ground in a pre-season Grand Final win against the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collingwood_Magpies_8acc.html" title="Collingwood Magpies">Collingwood Magpies</a>.</p>

<p>In 2005, under coach <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neil_Craig_d3c1.html" title="Neil Craig">Neil Craig</a>, McLeod made a return to the half-back line to provide his side with run and drive from defense using his sublime skills. In round 2 against Collingwood and the scores tied late in the game and the Crows desperately needing a win, McLeod kicked an unbelievable left-foot goal from the boundary line from about 35m out to seal the deal. This win would would be the Crows first in 6 years vs the Pies and spur Adelaide to a minor premiership by the end (top spot after 22 rounds) of the season.</p>
<p>In October, McLeod was named co-captain of the Australian <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_rules_football.html" title="International rules football">International rules football</a> team against <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>. In what became a somewhat spiteful match, Australia would win comfortably while McLeod was named best player and awarded the <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Stynes_Medal_3aeb.html" title="Jim Stynes Medal">Jim Stynes Medal</a>.</p>
<p><a name="2006"></a></p>

<p>After a year under Neil Craig's system, McLeod would return to some of his best form. Teaming with the younger <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graham_Johncock_2ae6.html" title="Graham Johncock">Graham Johncock</a> at half-back, the duo would be part of a stingy Adelaide defense, regularly streaming from the back lines, evading opponents and delivering the ball with precision to teammates up the ground. His form would eventually lead to his 4th All-Australian selection.</p>
<p>Against the <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essendon_Bombers_744b.html" title="Essendon Bombers">Essendon Bombers</a> in round 10, McLeod played his 250th game at <a href="../../../a/a/m/AAMI_Stadium_9f5b.html" title="AAMI Stadium">AAMI Stadium</a> where he tallied 18 disposals while soaring for a spectacular mark in a 138-point demolition of the Bombers.</p>
<p>For much of the season, however, McLeod played with a painful <a href="../../../b/u/r/Bursa_%28anatomy%29.html" title="Bursa (anatomy)">bursa</a> in his left foot. After round 16, the decision was made for him to undergo surgery to remove the bursa, an operation expected to keep him out for a few weeks.</p>
<p>McLeod made a relatively earlier than expected return to the side in round 19. However, by round 21, after a disappointing loss to <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Adelaide_Power_a719.html" title="Port Adelaide Power">Port Adelaide</a>, his foot was heavily infected and the club announced that he would require further surgery along with the disappointing news that he would more than likely miss the rest of the season and Finals. <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Despite rating himself just a "two out of ten" chance to return for the finals <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup>, McLeod made a surprise return to the side in the preliminary final against the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Coast_Eagles_14b7.html" title="West Coast Eagles">West Coast Eagles</a>. After a promising first half, however, McLeod and the Crows were swamped by the West Coast midfield in the second half to eventually lose by ten points. McLeod kicked a superb boundary line goal from the southwest pocket.</p>

<p>McLeod began the season by winning the Polly Farmer Medal after being the best for the Indigenous All-Stars in a disappointing 50-point loss to <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essendon.html" title="Essendon">Essendon</a>.

<p>Despite separating for a short while in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, Andrew is still currently married to Rachael.
