However, sovereignty in the UK no longer rests with the monarch, since the <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_of_Rights_1689_2865.html" title="Bill of Rights 1689">English Bill of Rights in 1689</a>, which established the principle of Parliamentary Soverignity. Despite this the Monarch remains Head of State, akin to a <a href="../../../p/r/e/President.html" title="President">President</a> in <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">European</a> (but not <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a>) political tradition.</p>
<p>Originally the monarch possessed the right to choose any British <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizen.html" title="Citizen">citizen</a> to be her <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_2cf9.html" title="Prime Minister">Prime Minister</a> and could call and dissolve <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament.html" title="Parliament">Parliament</a> whenever he or she wished. However, in accordance with the current 'unwritten constitution', the Prime Minister is the leader of the largest party in the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Commons_41bc.html" title="House of Commons">House of Commons</a> and Parliament is dissolved at the time suggested by him or her. The monarch retains the ability to deny giving a <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_%28proposed_law%29.html" title="Bill (proposed law)">bill</a> <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Assent_5f14.html" title="Royal Assent">Royal Assent</a>, although in modern times this becomes increasingly more unlikely, as it would cause a constitutional crisis. <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_of_Great_Britain_81c8.html" title="Anne of Great Britain">Queen Anne</a> was the last monarch to exercise this power, which she did on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_11.html" title="March 11">11 March</a> <a href="../../../1/7/0/1708.html" title="1708">1708</a> with regard to a bill "for the settling of Militia in <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>". Other royal powers called <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_prerogative.html" title="Royal prerogative">royal prerogative</a>, such as patronage to appoint ministers and the ability to declare war, are exercised by the Prime Minister and the <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabinet_of_the_United_Kingdom_1af8.html" title="Cabinet of the United Kingdom">Cabinet</a>, with the formal consent of the Queen.</p>
<div class="thumb tleft">
<div class="thumbinner" style="width:122px;"><a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:EIIR-80-sm.jpg">Image:EIIR-80-sm.jpg</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Queen <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom_e66a.html" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Elizabeth II</a></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Today the Sovereign has an essentially <a href="../../../c/e/r/Ceremonial.html" title="Ceremonial">ceremonial</a> role restricted in exercise of power by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Convention.html" title="Convention">convention</a> and <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_opinion.html" title="Public opinion">public opinion</a>. However the monarch does continue to exercise three essential rights: the <i>right to be consulted, the right to advise and the right to warn</i> <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>. Prime ministers have weekly confidential meetings with the monarch. The longer the monarch reigns the greater the degree of his or her experience and knowledge becomes, and so the meetings become more and more useful.</p>
<p>In formal terms, the <i>Crown in Parliament</i> is sovereign even though in practical terms the political head of the UK is the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom_dd87.html" title="Prime Minister of the United Kingdom">Prime Minister</a> (<a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Blair_f43c.html" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a> since <a href="../../../2/n/d/2nd_May_e085.html" title="2nd May">2nd May</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>). However, the real powers of position of the Monarch in the British Constitution should not be downplayed. The monarch does indeed retain some power, but it has to be used with discretion, for instance with the 1996 sacking of the Australian Prime Minister <sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. She fulfils the necessary constitutional role as head of state, and with the absence of a distinct separation of powers in the American model and a strong second chamber, acts as a final check on executive power. If a time came to pass, for instance, when a law threatened the freedom or security of her <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_subject.html" title="British subject">subjects</a>, the Queen could decline royal assent, free as she is from the eddies of party politics.

<p>As in other <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliamentary_system.html" title="Parliamentary system">parliamentary systems</a> of government, the executive (called "the government") is drawn from and is answerable to Parliament - a successful <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motion_of_No_Confidence_bbcc.html" title="Motion of No Confidence">vote of no confidence</a> will force the government either to resign or to seek a <a href="../../../d/i/s/Dissolution_of_parliament.html" title="Dissolution of parliament">parliamentary dissolution</a> and a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_elections_bb15.html" title="United Kingdom general elections">general elections</a>. In practice members of parliament of all major parties are strictly controlled by <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whip_%28politics%29.html" title="Whip (politics)">whips</a> who try to ensure they vote according to party policy.

<p>In <a href="../../../n/o/v/November.html" title="November">November</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, the Blair government suffered its first defeat, on a <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism_Act_2006_758d.html" title="Terrorism Act 2006">proposal</a> to extend the period for detaining terrorist suspects to 90 days. Before this, the last bill proposed by a government that was defeated in the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Commons_41bc.html" title="House of Commons">House of Commons</a> was the Shop Hours Bill in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>, one of only three in the <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a>. Governments with a small <a href="../../../m/a/j/Majority.html" title="Majority">majority</a>, or <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coalition_government.html" title="Coalition government">coalition governments</a> are much more vulnerable to defeat.

As such, Governments with small majorities find it extremely difficult to implement controversial legislation and tend to become bogged down cutting deals with factions within their party or seeking assistance from other political parties.</p>

<p>The UK is divided into parliamentary <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constituency.html" title="Constituency">constituencies</a> of broadly equal population (decided by the <a href="../../../b/o/u/Boundary_Commission_f5e4.html" title="Boundary Commission">Boundary Commission</a>), each of which elects a <a href="../../../m/e/m/Member_of_Parliament_22d1.html" title="Member of Parliament">Member of Parliament</a> (MP) to the House of Commons.

In modern times, all Prime Ministers and <a href="../../../l/e/a/Leader_of_the_Opposition_54c2.html" title="Leader of the Opposition">Leaders of the Opposition</a> have been drawn from the Commons, not the Lords. <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alec_Douglas-Home_d703.html" title="Alec Douglas-Home">Alec Douglas-Home</a> resigned from his peerages days after becoming Prime Minister in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a>, and the last Prime Minister before him from the Lords left in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1902.html" title="1902">1902</a> (the <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Gascoyne-Cecil%2C_3rd_Marquess_of_Salisbury_8761.html" title="Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury">Marquess of Salisbury</a>).</p>
<p>One party usually has a majority in Parliament, because of the use of the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Past_the_Post_electoral_system_687b.html" title="First Past the Post electoral system">First Past the Post electoral system</a>, which has been conducive in creating the current <a href="../../../t/w/o/Two_party_system.html" title="Two party system">two party system</a>. The monarch normally asks a person commissioned to form a government simply whether it can <i>survive</i> in the House of Commons, something which majority governments are expected to be able to do. In exceptional circumstances the monarch asks someone to 'form a government' <i>with a parliamentary minority</i> <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> which in the event of no party having a majority requires the formation of a <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coalition_government.html" title="Coalition government">coalition government</a>.

<p>In addition to the House of Commons, <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> now has its own parliament and <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales.html" title="Wales">Wales</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> have assemblies.</p>
<p>Some members of the devolved bodies are elected by a form of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proportional_representation.html" title="Proportional representation">proportional representation</a>. Although the new <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devolved_government.html" title="Devolved government">devolved governments</a> have some legislative and other powers, they do not have the same powers as the UK parliament. As <i>devolved</i> systems of government, they have no constitutional <i>right</i> to exist and can have their powers broadened, narrowed or changed by an Act of the UK Parliament.</p>
<p>Thus, the United Kingdom is said to have a <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unitary_state.html" title="Unitary state">unitary state</a> with a devolved system of government. This contrasts with a <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_republic.html" title="Federal republic">federal</a> system, in which sub-parliaments or state parliaments and assemblies have a clearly defined constitutional <i>right</i> to exist and a <i>right</i> to exercise certain constitutionally guaranteed and defined functions and cannot be unilaterally abolished by Acts of the central parliament.</p>
<p>England at present has no devolved government although several pressure groups <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> are calling for one. One of their main arguments is that MPs (and thus voters) from different parts of the UK have inconsistent powers. As it stands an MP from Scotland can vote on legislation which affects the whole of the UK but MPs from other parts of the UK cannot vote on matters devolved to Scotland. Indeed <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Reid_c88a.html" title="John Reid">John Reid</a> current <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_Secretary_407d.html" title="Home Secretary">Home Secretary</a>, who is <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish.html" title="Scottish">Scottish</a>, runs a department which deals only with England and Wales.</p>
<p>The present policy of the UK Government is to increase national and regional <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devolution.html" title="Devolution">devolution</a>. The opportunity to elect a regional tier of elected government was to be offered to some of the <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regions_of_England_a07f.html" title="Regions of England">regions of England</a>, was accepted by referendum in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, but was rejected in a referendum in <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_East_England_39af.html" title="North East England">North East England</a> and is now less likely to be offered elsewhere. A movement to obtain some degree of home rule also exists in <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornish_nationalist.html" title="Cornish nationalist">Cornwall</a>, a petition of over 50000 signatures was collected endorsing the call for a Cornish Assembly. However, the UK government is not known to be considering any form of devolution to Cornwall.</p>
<p>It has been said that the process of devolution represents the gradual return of autonomy to the last remaining territories colonised by England that are still under its' control. Although Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland were the first to be conquered and colonised, they would be the last to regain self determination.</p>

<p>The current government of Northern Ireland was established as a result of the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a> <a href="../../../g/o/o/Good_Friday_Agreement_6853.html" title="Good Friday Agreement">Good Friday Agreement</a> (GFA), properly known as the <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belfast_Agreement_6a1b.html" title="Belfast Agreement">Belfast Agreement</a>. This created the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_Assembly_cf59.html" title="Northern Ireland Assembly">Northern Ireland Assembly</a> which is currently under suspension. The Assembly is a <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unicameral.html" title="Unicameral">unicameral</a> body consisting of 108 members elected under the <a href="../../../s/i/n/Single_Transferable_Vote_c914.html" title="Single Transferable Vote">Single Transferable Vote</a> form of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proportional_representation.html" title="Proportional representation">proportional representation</a>. The Assembly is based on the principle of power-sharing, in order to ensure that both communities in Northern Ireland, <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unionists_%28Ireland%29_90f2.html" title="Unionists (Ireland)">unionist</a> and <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_nationalism.html" title="Irish nationalism">nationalist</a>, participate in governing the region. When fully operational, it has power to legislate in a wide range of areas and to elect the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_Executive_5f71.html" title="Northern Ireland Executive">Northern Ireland Executive</a> (cabinet). It sits at <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_Buildings_%28Northern_Ireland%29_7f86.html" title="Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)">Parliament Buildings</a> at <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stormont%2C_Belfast_12ee.html" title="Stormont, Belfast">Stormont</a> in <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belfast.html" title="Belfast">Belfast</a>.</p>
<p>The Assembly has authority to legislate in a field of competences known as "transferred matters". These matters are not explicitly enumerated in the Northern Ireland Act 1998 but instead include any competence not explicitly retained by the Parliament at Westminster. Powers reserved by Westminster are divided into "excepted matters", which it retains indefinitely, and "reserved matters", which may be transferred to the competence of the Northern Ireland Assembly at a future date. Health and education are "transferred" but criminal law and police are "reserved" and royal succession, defence and international relations are all "excepted".</p>
<p>While the Assembly is in suspension its legislative powers are exercised by the UK government which effectively has power to legislate by decree. Laws that would normally be within the competence of the Assembly are passed by the UK government in the form of <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_in_Council_8212.html" title="Order in Council">Orders-in-Council</a> rather than legislative acts.</p>

<p>There is no legal or constitutional separation of the legislative and executive functions of the National Assembly, since it is a single corporate entity. Compared with other <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliamentary_systems.html" title="Parliamentary systems">parliamentary systems</a>, and other UK devolved countries, this is highly unusual.

It is proposed to regularise the separation, and it is considered likely that the UK Parliament will pass the necessary legislation.</p>
<p>Although the Assembly is a legislature, it currently does not have primary legislative or fiscal powers, as these powers had been reserved by <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom_dcaf.html" title="Parliament of the United Kingdom">Westminster</a>.

<p>Unlike many <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">European</a> nations, the United Kingdom uses a <a href="../../../f/i/r/First-past-the-post.html" title="First-past-the-post">first-past-the-post</a> system to elect members of Parliament. Therefore, elections and political parties in the United Kingdom are affected by <a href="../../../d/u/v/Duverger%27s_Law_a378.html" title="Duverger's Law">Duverger's Law</a>, which causes the agglomeration of related political ideologies into a few large parties with many small parties rarely winning respresentation.</p>
<p>Historically, the United Kingdom had two major political parties, though currently three parties dominate the political landscape. Originally, the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29_3ac1.html" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservatives</a> and the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_%28UK%29_4ba9.html" title="Liberal Party (UK)">Liberals</a> dominated British politics, but the Liberal Party collapsed in the early twentieth century and was largely replaced by the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_Party_%28UK%29_3e02.html" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour Party</a>. In the 1980s, the Liberals merged with the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_Democratic_Party_%28UK%29_9a0a.html" title="Social Democratic Party (UK)">Social Democratic Party</a> and have recently experienced a resurgence as the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Democrats_8c75.html" title="Liberal Democrats">Liberal Democrats</a>, enough so to again be considered a major party. In addition to the three major parties, many minor parties contest elections. Of these, few except for regional parties such as the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_National_Party_206a.html" title="Scottish National Party">Scottish National Party</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Unionist_Party_b2cc.html" title="Democratic Unionist Party">Democratic Unionist Party</a> win seats in Parliament.</p>
<p>In the most recent general election in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, the Labour Party won re-election on a reduced majority, with both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats making gains at the expense of Labour.</p>

<li>The <a href="../../../s/i/n/Single_Transferable_Vote_c914.html" title="Single Transferable Vote">Single Transferable Vote</a> system is used to elect the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_Assembly_cf59.html" title="Northern Ireland Assembly">Northern Ireland Assembly</a> and Northern Ireland's local councils.

</ul>
<p>In the last few general elections, voter mandates for Westminster in the 40% ranges have been swung into 60% parliamentary majorities. No government has won a majority of the popular vote since the <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_National_Government_c29e.html" title="UK National Government">National Government</a> of <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanley_Baldwin_84d4.html" title="Stanley Baldwin">Stanley Baldwin</a> in <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1935_99c6.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1935">1935</a>.

One reason for all the quirks is that Britain has many political parties, making it possible to win individual constituencies on less than 50% of the vote due to the opposition votes being divided.</p>
<p><a href="../../../e/l/e/Electoral_reform.html" title="Electoral reform">Electoral reform</a> has been considered for <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_elections_bb15.html" title="United Kingdom general elections">general elections</a> many times, but after the <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jenkins_Commission_a379.html" title="Jenkins Commission">Jenkins Commission</a> report in October <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>, which suggested the <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_vote_top-up.html" title="Alternative vote top-up">Alternative vote top-up</a> for <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_elections_bb15.html" title="United Kingdom general elections">general elections</a> was effectively ignored by the government, there have been no further government proposals for reform.

<p>Low turnout is a concern, as the percentage of the electorate who voted in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_2005_e0e0.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 2005">last general election</a> was just 61%.</p>

<p>UK political parties originated in <a href="../../../1/6/6/1662.html" title="1662">1662</a> in the aftermath of the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Civil_War_6bfe.html#Aftermath" title="English Civil War">English Civil War</a>, with the creation of the Court Party and the Country Party, soon becoming known as the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Tory.html" title="Tory">Tories</a> (now the Conservative party, still commonly referred to as 'the Tories') and the <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whig_Party_%28UK%29_3606.html" title="Whig Party (UK)">Whigs</a> (now the Liberal Democrats, though the term 'Whig' has become obsolete). The two remained the main political parties until the <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a>.</p>
<p>The term 'Tory' originates from the Exclusion Bill crisis of <a href="../../../1/6/7/1678.html" title="1678">1678</a>-<a href="../../../1/6/8/1681.html" title="1681">1681</a> - the Whigs were those who supported the exclusion of the Roman Catholic <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_II_of_England_fb06.html" title="James II of England">Duke of York</a> from the thrones of England, Ireland and Scotland, and the Tories were those who opposed it. Both names were originally insults: a "whiggamor" was a cattle driver, and a "tory" was an <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_language.html" title="Irish language">Irish</a> term for an outlaw.</p>
<p>Generally, the Tories were associated with lesser gentry and the Church of England, while Whigs were more associated with trade, money, larger land holders (or "land magnates"), expansion and tolerance. Both were still committed to the political system in place at that time. Neither group could be considered a true political party in the modern sense.</p>
<p>The Rochdale <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radicals_%28UK%29_4abe.html" title="Radicals (UK)">Radicals</a> were a group of more extreme reformists who were also heavily involved in the <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cooperative.html" title="Cooperative">Cooperative</a> movement. They sought to bring about a more equal society, and are considered by modern standards to be left-wing.</p>

<p>After becoming associated with repression of popular discontent in the years after <a href="../../../1/8/1/1815.html" title="1815">1815</a>, the Tories underwent a fundamental transformation under the influence of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Peel_d3b1.html" title="Robert Peel">Robert Peel</a>, himself an industrialist rather than a landowner, who in his <a href="../../../1/8/3/1835.html" title="1835">1835</a> "<a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamworth_Manifesto_0b26.html" title="Tamworth Manifesto">Tamworth Manifesto</a>" outlined a new "Conservative" philosophy of reforming ills while conserving the good.</p>
<p>Though Peel's supporters subsequently split from their colleagues over the issue of free trade in <a href="../../../1/8/4/1846.html" title="1846">1846</a>, ultimately joining the Whigs and the <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radical_Party_%28UK%29_8522.html" title="Radical Party (UK)">Radicals</a> to form what would become the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_%28UK%29_4ba9.html" title="Liberal Party (UK)">Liberal Party</a>, Peel's version of the party's underlying outlook was retained by the remaining Tories, who adopted his label of Conservative as the official name of their party.</p>
<p>The term '<a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_%28UK%29_4ba9.html" title="Liberal Party (UK)">Liberal Party</a>' was first used officially in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1868.html" title="1868">1868</a>, though it had been in use colloquially for decades beforehand. The Liberal Party formed a government in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1870.html" title="1870">1870</a> and then alternated with the Conservative Party as the party of government throughout the late <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a> and early <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Parliamentary_Party_95a5.html" title="Irish Parliamentary Party">Irish Parliamentary Party</a> was set up to replace the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_Rule_League_f339.html" title="Home Rule League">Home Rule League</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/8/1882.html" title="1882">1882</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/0/1900.html" title="1900">1900</a>, the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_Party_%28UK%29_3e02.html" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour Representation Committee</a> was established and it changed its name to <b>The Labour Party</b> in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1906.html" title="1906">1906</a>. After the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">First World War</a>, this led to the demise of the Liberal Party as the main liberal force in British politics. The existence of the Labour Party on the left of British politics led to a slow waning of energy from the Liberal Party, ending with it taking third place in national politics. After performing poorly in the elections of <a href="../../../1/9/2/1922.html" title="1922">1922</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/2/1923.html" title="1923">1923</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/2/1924.html" title="1924">1924</a>, the Liberal Party was superseded by the Labour Party as the party of the left.</p>
<p>Following two brief spells in minority governments in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1924.html" title="1924">1924</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/2/1929.html" title="1929">1929</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/3/1931.html" title="1931">1931</a>, the Labour Party had its first true victory after <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> in the <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a> "<a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1945_2336.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1945">khaki election</a>". Throughout the rest of the twentieth century, Labour governments alternated with Conservative governments. The Conservatives were in power for most of the time, with the Labour Party suffering the "wilderness years" of <a href="../../../1/9/5/1951.html" title="1951">1951</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a> (three straight General Election defeats) and <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a> (four straight General Election defeats).</p>
<p>During this second period, right-winger <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margaret_Thatcher_2770.html" title="Margaret Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>, who became leader of the Conservative party in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>, made a fundamental change to Conservative policies, turning the Conservative Party into a staunch right-wing party. In the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1979_73bc.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1979">General Election of 1979</a> she defeated <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Callaghan_5086.html" title="James Callaghan">James Callaghan</a>'s troubled Labour government after the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winter_of_Discontent_27b7.html" title="Winter of Discontent">winter of discontent</a>.</p>
<p>For most of the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>, and the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a> under her successor <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Major_5fd6.html" title="John Major">John Major</a>, Conservative governments pursued policies of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Privatisation.html" title="Privatisation">privatisation</a>, anti-<a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_Union_af21.html" title="Trade Union">trade-unionism</a>, and <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monetarism.html" title="Monetarism">Monetarism</a>, now known collectively as <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thatcherism.html" title="Thatcherism">Thatcherism</a>.</p>
<p>The Labour Party elected left-winger <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Foot_cf4a.html" title="Michael Foot">Michael Foot</a> as their leader after their 1979 election defeat, and he responded to disatisfaction with the Labour Party by pursuing a number of radical policies developed by its grass-roots members. Several right-wing MPs formed a breakaway group in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>, called the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_Democratic_Party_%28UK%29_9a0a.html" title="Social Democratic Party (UK)">Social Democratic Party</a> (SDP), a move which split Labour and is widely believed to have made Labour unelectable for a decade. The SDP formed an alliance with the Liberal Party which contested the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1983_c3e4.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1983">1983</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1987_8979.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1987">1987</a> general elections as a centrist alternative to Labour and the Conservatives. After some initial success, the SDP did not prosper, and was accused by some of splitting the anti-Conservative vote.</p>
<p>The SDP eventually merged with the Liberal Party to form the Liberal Democrats in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>. Support for the new party has increased since then, and the Liberal Democrats (often referred to as LibDems) in 1997 and 2001 gained an increased number of seats in the House of Commons.</p>
<p>Labour were badly defeated by the Conservatives in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1983_c3e4.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1983">general election of 1983</a> and Michael Foot was replaced by <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neil_Kinnock_6f58.html" title="Neil Kinnock">Neil Kinnock</a> as leader of the Labour Party. Kinnock expelled the far left-wing <a href="../../../m/i/l/Militant_Tendency_8f9d.html" title="Militant Tendency">Militant Tendency</a> group, and moderated many of the party's policies. He was replaced by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Smith_%28UK_politician%29_2b76.html" title="John Smith (UK politician)">John Smith</a> after Labour's narrow defeat in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1992_ac6e.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1992">1992 general election</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Blair_f43c.html" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a> became leader of the Labour party after John Smith's sudden death from a heart attack in 1994. He continued to move the Labour Party back towards the right by loosening links with the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_union.html" title="Trade union">unions</a> and embracing many of Margaret Thatcher's policies. This, coupled with the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Profession.html" title="Profession">professionalising</a> of the party machine's approach to the media, helped Labour win the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1997_ac1f.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1997">1997 General Election</a> with a historic landslide result. The Labour Party has moved from being a <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_socialist.html" title="Democratic socialist">democratic socialist</a> party to being a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-liberal.html" title="Neo-liberal">neo-liberal</a> party, giving it three landslide victories but greatly reducing its membership and its support in the electorate.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_Party_%28UK%29_3e02.html" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour Party</a> consolidated its position in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, winning a full second term - a first-time achievement for the Labour Party - under the leadership of <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Blair_f43c.html" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a>.</p>
<p>This led to a crisis of confidence in the Conservative Party, which some would argue had become complacent with its position as the 'natural party of government' after 18 years of power. The party's drift to the <a href="../../../r/i/g/Right-wing_politics.html" title="Right-wing politics">right</a> lost it many of its working-class voters, and its ageing membership (average age 65) and vote (third party among the under 45s) meant that avoiding extinction became a higher priority than winning an election. It appeared that Labour's drop in popularity in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>-<a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, coinciding with the Conservatives' appointment of <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Howard_90a3.html" title="Michael Howard">Michael Howard</a> as leader, might make the Conservatives again a serious challenger to the Labour government. However, Tony Blair's party secured a majority for the third time in May <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, albeit with a greatly reduced majority. In late 2005, the Conservatives replaced Michael Howard with <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Cameron_8722.html" title="David Cameron">David Cameron</a>, who has attempted to modernise its old-fashioned image.</p>

<p>Other <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_political_parties_in_the_United_Kingdom_2976.html" title="List of political parties in the United Kingdom">political parties</a> exist, but generally do not succeed in returning MPs to <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament.html" title="Parliament">Parliament</a>.

<p>There are also a few independent politicians with no party allegiance. This normally occurs only when an MP decides to break with his party in mid-session. Since 1950 only two MPs have been elected as genuine independents, though others have been elected after breaking away from their party:</p>

<p>The UK is divided into a variety of different types of <a href="../../../l/o/c/Local_authority.html" title="Local authority">Local Authorities</a>, with different functions and responsibillities, which are further subdivided in rural areas and some urban areas into <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_parish.html" title="Civil parish">parishes</a>.</p>
<p>Local Authorities are responsible for such matters as administering education, public transport, and the management of public spaces. Local authorities are often engaged in <a href="../../../c/o/m/Community_politics.html" title="Community politics">community politics</a>.</p>
<p>Parishes have councils too and some are known as city or town councils. These councils are either made up of elected parish councillors, or in very small parishes, they use <a href="../../../d/i/r/Direct_democracy.html" title="Direct democracy">direct democracy</a>.</p>
<p>There are two common systems of local government in the UK: the old-style two-tier and newer single-tier system. The older (and far more complex) two-tier system consists of <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-metropolitan_district.html" title="Non-metropolitan district">District Councils</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Council_8a15.html" title="County Council">County Councils</a>. The District Councils are responsible for rubbish collection, granting planning permission and council housing. County Councils are responsible for education, social services, some public transport and other local functions.</p>
<p><a href="../../../u/n/i/Unitary_Authority_cc1c.html" title="Unitary Authority">Unitary Authorities</a>, which are in use throughout the whole of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and in some areas in England, have a single tier of local government, and combine District and County Council functions into one body.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_London_d0dd.html" title="Greater London">Greater London</a>, a unique two-tier system exists, with power shared between the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_borough.html" title="London borough">London borough</a> councils, and the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_London_Authority_2294.html" title="Greater London Authority">Greater London Authority</a> which is headed by an <a href="../../../m/a/y/Mayor_of_London_eb29.html" title="Mayor of London">elected mayor</a>.</p>
<p>Unitary authorities often share common public safety authorities with other neighbouring councils.

<p>In recent years, there have been divisions in both major parties as to whether the UK should form greater ties within the EU, leave things as they are, or reduce the EU's supranational powers.
