<p>Let's open this up for discussion, shall we? Here are the reasons why I am currently opposed to the infobox about the Hudson version of this song:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is aesthetically not pleasing as there is just enough text currently to support the main infobox.</li>
<li>It is not actually adding much (any?) info that is not already contained either within the text or the first infobox.</li>
<li>This song has not officially been promoted as a single in any way. Only "Listen" has actually received official promotion from the film soundtrack.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, if somebody would like to explain what this infobox <i>is</i> contributing, I would love to know. GassyGuy 01:26, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Your editions are erasing important information!<br />
and where there is not promotion about the single?? Of course there is<br />
The song is performming well on charts, coz the single is gaining cool rotation on radios, especially on Urban Radio stations, and don't you see television? the song as well as announcend as newest single from the motion picture!<br />
I'll report you to admins or mods for vandalism!<br />
Any informations that can add or especify details about the article are very welcome</p>

<dd>Well, I'm not the only one who is of this opinion, as I'm not the one who last removed it. I opened up the discussion here to see why the <i>infobox</i> (note I say the box, not the info) should be there. I am <b>not</b> removing information, as it's all in the article. I agree that it is now likely to be promoted as the second single, but the first two points I made above stand, as at least two other editors have implicitly agreed with in some form by removing this second infobox.

<dd>You are the only one who edited this article, many other editors have agreed with me stop this bullshit vandalism, like I said before, I'll report you to the admins and mods, leave the infobox, infoboxes can be added to the article independently if there is or not enough text, the main factor being the informations that it can pass to the readers. <a href="../../../e/d/u/User%7EEduemoni_1322.html" title="User:Eduemoni">Eduemoni</a> 21:59, 14 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The edit history shows that, besides my removal of it, other users to do so include <a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">User:FuriousFreddy</a> and <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">User:Kafziel</a>, so you're either not looking at all or you're just being difficult. Either way, you're not addressing this issue that the information is <b>already in the article</b>, rendering the infobox not particularly informative. Regardless, this discussion is proving futile, so I will invite you to bring in admin intervention for my "vandalism." GassyGuy 22:05, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>For what it's worth, I'm going to back off for a bit and wait to see if somebody else comes to contribute to this discussion, but I think the recent addition of a chart position section is also repetitive to the text and unnecessary, and, were I to hypothesize, is a way to take up space and rationalize the second infobox, which also doesn't need to be there. GassyGuy 22:25, 14 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>And, hey, since I'm going for broke, I think using edit summaries would be a good idea, and maybe using the "show preview" button instead of making multiple consecutive edits. Those both tend to be recommended. GassyGuy 22:27, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I removed the infobox before because the article was too short to have two infoboxes. Even now, it is still too short to have two infoboxes, but because Hudson's version is a top 40 R&amp;B hit now, I'll let that go. However, <a href="../../../e/d/u/User%7EEduemoni_1322.html" title="User:Eduemoni">Eduemoni</a> , you need to review the guidelines at as far as how to properly fill out these infoboxes. There are set directions on what to put where. The current version is correctly formatted (reguardless if the song is a single from a soundtrack, Hudson is to be listed as the artist, and "Recorded" is for information on where and when the song was recorded). --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 21:18, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>"The Hudson's version as well aclaimed as the original, receiving good reviews, just not demonstrating her vocal techniques used as well as the theatrical performance, what the song demands."

<dd>That section desperately needs cleanup, but I don't feel like being called a vandal just yet, so I'm hoping someone else will undertake it. I have a feeling that is attempting some sort of original research, besides being incomprehensible, and should be stricken. GassyGuy 00:20, 15 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, I'll be the vandal then; I deleted it. If the original author can reconstruct the sentence so as to be comprehensible, they're more than welcome to re-submit it. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.95.51.216_4d49.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.95.51.216">24.95.51.216</a> (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.95.51.216.html" title="User talk:24.95.51.216">talk</a>) 09:40, 15 January 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

</dd>
<dd>I went ahead and did some copyediting on this section, and also removed a charts section that was completely redundant to the text. I did not remove the second infobox, but this is more in compromise than any sort of concession that it belongs there. I would still love to hear more about the community's opinion of it. GassyGuy 18:59, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I have also reverted a conversion of the single infoboxes to song infoboxes. The two types of infobox have distinct uses, and simply converting them to song infoboxes is not appropriate as was done. It solves the space problem, but it causes one which goes from aesthetic problems to utility problems, which are of greater magnitude. GassyGuy 21:27, 15 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Two questions -- (1) What IS the difference between the single infobox and the song infobox (since the song infobox seems to be the least cumbersome format for this situtation)? (2) Given the rising success of Hudson, the <i>Dreamgirls</i> film and the Hudson version of the song, why are you still fighting this? 65.215.37.164 --- 16:02, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>1) The song infobox is used mainly for pop standards and other songs of that nature. I wouldn't be opposed to converting the entire thing to a song infobox, but having two song infoboxes is nonstandard usage at best. 2) I'm not sure exactly how the infobox somehow correlates to Hudson's success? I'm not fighting the addition of information about her version. I'm attempting to copyedit that information so that it's comprehensible, even, although <a href="../../../e/d/u/User%7EEduemoni_1322.html" title="User:Eduemoni">User:Eduemoni</a>, who seems to have a bit of a tenuous grasp on the language, keeps reverting my edits in that respect too. But I'm not sure why an infobox is somehow an indicator of success - it's just a way to present information. GassyGuy 16:28, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I recall seeing a rap music video a while ago that sounds like it has a sped up sample of this song in it (particularly the "...you're gonna love me" line). If enyone knows what im talking about, please post it somewhere in the article. thanks. 69.250.130.215 20:21, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
