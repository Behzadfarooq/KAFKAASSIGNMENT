	    <p>here are some of his essay's he has written for English</p>
<p>this was an essay he had written for "the scarlet Ibis"</p>
<p>"Foreshadowing, symbolism, and imagery are all elements which compose style. All are very important; Foreshadowing adds suspense, and symbolism contributes to interpretation, imagery contributes, “visual aids”, which also aids interpretation. In this classic short story, “The Scarlet Ibis” by James Hurst, Foreshadowing, symbolism, and imagery combine to create a true literary master piece.</p>
<p>Foreshadowing is a literary device in which an author drops subtle hints about plots development in the story. These hints keep the reader at suspense through out the story. In this story there is a lot of foreshadowing, most were about doodles death. For example, “The last graveyard flowers were blooming, and their smell drifted through our house, speaking softly the names of our dead." This passage is foreshadowing the death of Doodle. Another example is when James Hurst talks about Doodle's full name, "William Armstrong," he says that "such a name sounds good only on a tombstone," this also is foreshadowing Doodle's death. Another example is that Aunt Nicey says that red dead birds are very bad luck; this also is foreshadowing Doodle's death because when doodle was born he was red. And finally and most importantly the death of the scarlet ibis this is foreshadowing because, like doodle, is rare and amazing. Foreshadowing is definitely very what makes this story so good.</p>
<p>"Symbolism is the creative use of random symbols as representing anything from concepts to an idea. Symbolism is another important element in the "The Scarlet Ibis." For example, in doodle's lies, the ten foot tail of the small peacock (I think) refers to the Doodle's full name, William Armstrong as "a big tail on a small kite" like the large tail on the small bird. Also (I think) the coffin symbolizes Doodle's death when his brother forces him to touch it. Also the beautiful “Old Woman Swamp” symbolizes paradise were they spend their happy time together. And lastly the scarlet ibis symbolizes doodle, both are rare and amazing, and both die the same day. Also after reading this story about three times I realized that doodle's neck, red with blood, and skinny stiff legs, are a way to portray him as the scarlet ibis. Imagery is any literary reference to the five senses: sight, touch, smell, hearing, and taste. Imagery is any words that can draw a picture in your head. Image is also an important element in the "The Scarlet Ibis." An example the hurricane is likened to a bloodthirsty "hawk at the entrails of a chicken." This creates a picture, at least in my mind, of ruin and destruction. Also "The slanted rays of the sun burn orange in the pines," this al least to me creates an image of peace, beauty, and happiness. Also in the opening the yard is another example of the use of imagery. the yard is described with words like "rank", "rotting", "empty cradle," and "bleeding tree," this creates a picture of sadness, and the phrase "speaking softly the names of our dead" this give you the picture of death. At first I didn’t like this book but after reading it a couple of times I decided that this book really is a master piece. The book is great at using foreshadowing, imagery, and symbolism. I could tell that the author put lots of time and thought in to the story."</p>

<p>Another essay is for the daoutors of the american revolution thing</p>
<p>"The following text are exerts from a journal found on an island in the Caribbean. The body found near the journal was mangled and now was only a skeleton.</p>
<p>“The year is about 1492. My father had recommended me to a new explore Christopher Columbus. Christopher Columbus was seen by most people as a great explorer in the making and I had thought this also. Christopher Columbus had accepted my father’s offer of me as a ship crew mate; Christopher said that he was looking for a new route to India and the east. So with in about four months I and the others had packed up the ship and now it was ready for departure.”</p>
<pre>
“The day is August 3, 1492. The ship had just set sail from the great country of Spain. As we sailed in to the endless ocean I watched the city of Palos until I could not see land in any direction. My heart is filled with optimism and sorrow, optimism for what may lay ahead and sorrow for not being with my love and my wife Laura. The voyage is going pretty smoothly despite the sidle smell of human waste and some rotting food.”
</pre>
<pre>
“The day is September 12, 1492. I have been about six weeks out in the baron ocean, what starting to get to everyone. The smell by now is almost unbearable; smells of dead animals, rotten foods, human excrement and just about anything else. Every now and then I look out across the ocean and I see land for a few seconds but then I realize I’m just hallucinating. By now I have fully recognize my hate for the ocean and my love for Laura. It has been a long time since I have laid my eyes upon her or since I had been touched her. My hope is that we will arrive in the east in about four weeks or less.”
</pre>
<pre>
“I have been waiting for this ever since I had stepped foot on this cursed ship, we have arrived on land. The date of this glorious day is October 11, 1492. After a while Christopher Columbus realized we had not found the east, but instead a new group of islands. Christopher Columbus decided to set sail again to find more land if there was any. But before we left, we had enslaved some of the natives on the island.”
</pre>
<pre>
“The date is October 24, 1492. We had found more islands and some of them even bigger the first one we had set foot on. Christopher Columbus had decided it was time to go back to Spain for new supplies and a new crew. I had rejoiced at this comment for I will see Laura soon.”
</pre>
<p><br /></p>
<pre>
   “The date does not matter. My ship, the Santa Maria had wrecked and the pinta has sailed off without the other ships. I had tried to catch the attention of the other ships but they must have not seen me, for they too had sailed off with out me. myself along with about fourty other people are stranded at this so called Fort Novidad. Now I sit on this beach by my self on an island with no hope of seeing Laura or my family again. So this is my last entry for I have set a noose tied with my pants. I will end my life to save my self the misery of dieing slowly. Good bye, Laura….”"
