<p>I have a problem that I would like to impart to all you good 'Beatles project' editors, and it is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should anything directly Beatles-related be in the main Beatles' article, and only 'personal' stuff put into the Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, and Starr articles? I have the disturbing feeling that I'm repeating stuff in both Lennon and McCartney articles that should only be in the main article.</li>
<li>But... if only personal stuff is included in the individual Beatles' articles, would it make them too confusing/random, to read?</li>
</ul>
<p>Please answer (on a stamped and self-addressed postcard please) on our talk page. (This might be more interesting than talking about MBEs...&#160;:) <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasegde_c4ec.html" title="User:Andreasegde">andreasegde, Mr Hornby, and Sir Sean de Garde</a> 15:21, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh those forkin' articles (that may only work with a NY accent).... well, I think we have to have a not-huge Beatles section on each individual page - more than just "see the main article" - because of the flow and it would seem weird to cut it out of there. The stuff that is specific to an individual belongs in the individual pieces - like, say, details of John meeting Yoko - but we'd cetrtainly have to talk about Yoko in the Beatles article in terms of her impact on the group. In the Beatles article, obviously, we focus on the group while they were together, emphasizing the things that are group-ish like appearing before the Queen, or on Ed Sullivan, say (the only thing those two have in common, I might add) - and of course all of the record-related stuff, the breakup, the aftermath: meaning the way that the album "1" became a mega-hit, and the Anthologies, and "Love", etc. Sort of how I think the <a href="../../../l/e/n/Lennon_McCartney_9714.html" title="Lennon/McCartney">Lennon/McCartney</a> article focuses on their writing partnershp but of course we have to talk a bit on Macca and Lennon about it. Does that make any sense or just further confuse? If it added confusion, it's me, not you. <strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> 18:47, 7 January 2007 (UTC) To clarify - by "not huge" I mean small-ish.

<li>It would be difficult to completely seperate the individual from the group with regard to the band years. Another instance might be George Harrisons spiritual development, the entire band went on the pilgramage but only George continued the studies throughout the rest of his life. As <i>da Noo Yawker</i> says, where an individuals actions affected the band then that needs to be commented upon in both articles.<a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 13:44, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't have a really strong opinion about this but I think you guys are on a reasonable track. Conventionally, rollup articles tend to have summaries of detail items, and the summaries are often repeated as, or near, the leads of the detail articles. So repeating some part of the Beatles stuff, is not bad. If the main beatles article has a capsule bio of each of the Fab 4, that can be the lead for their article. Or something. I trust you lot to do the right thing so this is mostly a "carry on" message, you're doing good work. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 16:18, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have to admit that I have run out of energy on this gargantuan task. (I may be experiencing my first bout of 'Wiki-stress', and I don't like it very much). I will now concentrate on Mimi and George Smith, Julia and Freddie Lennon, and Jim and Mary McCartney for a while (if only to dispel some Urban Legends).

<dd>you've done some amazing re-search there, from my little stub. I'm gonna read it RIGHT NOW! BTW, I quite like her. She's just from a differant era.

<p>It's really late, but I just finally read through the new Lennon and have some comments that I don't want to forget, so forgive my incoherence. Wow - you did an amazing job!</p>
<p>OK:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Aunt Mater" - this is not a term I've heard in the US. Is it the same as "godmother"? If so, maybe we should put that, or whatever it means, in parens for those of us who NEVER would say "The Beatles was a band". (If you're not reading Talk:The Beatles, you will now assume I'm daft. I probably am, but not as much as <i>some</i> people... Read that talk page if you need a laugh.)</li>
<li>"The band switched to playing rock 'n' roll, using the name 'Johnny and The Moondogs', but Lennon found it too musically associated to skiffle." - not clear to me - if you mean the <i>name</i> J&amp;the M was too close to skiffle, then why say "musically"? I don't actually know what exactly skiffle is, so maybe this is clear to others.</li>
<li>I think we need to explain what happened (in Yoko section) between 1969 and the lost weekend - 1969 all seems fine, and the very next thing we hear is a few yrs later Yoko's getting him a girlfriend (kind of selfless of her, isn't it? I wouldn't have done that!) and throwing him out. Too abrupt - maybe a sentence or so about what happened there.I'm not sure what the story is, so I didn't add anything, but it needs something. (I did add a sentence at end of solo career to explain that he retired because we start the next section saying that he came out of retirement.) --<strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> continued below</li>

<dd><i><b>Here is the real story. May Pang was hired as an assistant and then ordered by Yoko to become a geisha for John. Basically this amounts to sexual harrassment but little slut May went along with it, and is now trying to convince the whole wide world that John loved her more then Yoko, that they were in love and other such drivel. Anyone can see that John pined for Yoko the whole time and was ecstatic to return to Yoko. Whether Yoko loved John as much as John loved Yoko is another issue to debate, but hard evidence and history shows without a doubt that John loved Yoko more then May. May would like you to forget that fact though.</b></i> this comment unsigned was from the creatively named 69.38.133.62 who is jonesing on may pang, but use of the word "geisha" was pretty funny, or racist. Not sure which.</dd>

<ul>
<li>Not crazy about the intro family life graf - I know we need one, but this wording seems to put the cart before the horse, talking about Julian and Sean before we have him meeting Cynthia.</li>
<li>"Following the Christmas holidays, he returned to live with Yoko Ono." - this is now out of context because that happened after May Pang and the lost weekend, but we haven't been told about May Pang yet.</li>
<li>SImilarly - we talk about his immigration situation being resolved before we hear that he had an immigration problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before, the piece was too rambling and all over the place - your chronological organization definitely makes more sense - but in these few places (possibly in another one or two, but these were the ones that bothered me) there is a continuity problem - any thoughts about how to handle it? Too late at night for me to think - I'll look at it again when both eyes are open.</p>
<p>Great job though - I'm not happy that so much had to be cut, because I think it tends to get a little choppy as a result, and I miss some of the language, but I do understand why you've done that. Thanks for all that work.

<p>Thanks (as always) for your comments, dearest Tvoz. I started work on it, and threw a load of stuff in, but I didn't really go through everything. I had an overload of pages (I was working on The Beatles, Macca and Lennon at the same time) and my brain <i>crashed</i>, so I went to the stubs to rebuild my original enthusiasm. (I'm really enjoying it, BTW.) Anyway, if there's anything you want to change, then you are the person to do it.

<p>P.S. "Aunt Mater" is confusing, because 'Mater' means mother. She was Lennon's Aunt Elizabeth, but (like Mimi and Julia) she was known by another name - from Elizabeth to Betty, and then to Mater. Funnily enough, this never occured to me before, but your eagle-eyes spotted it (again)&#160;:) <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasegde_c4ec.html" title="User:Andreasegde">andreasegde</a> 20:09, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Not sure what you're saying when you quote Star Trek ("to boldly go"); I assume you mean that if they do it, it must be OK.

<dd>No, I'm saying that it is an old rule that one shouldn't break. Poor old Captain Kirk is ridiculed because of it.

<p>Alright Mimi (if that is your real name. Which it isn't. Though it is a girls name.) The book I need is back in Bradford so I won't be able to get my hand on it until at least February.

<p>It said, in the last Beatles' newsletter, that "Sir Sean de Garde appears to have developed multiple personalities." This is very true (and made one laugh an awful lot) but it is necessary when one is faced with talking to one on one's pages that one has contributed to. (Work that one out...&#160;:) The changing of one's name brings tremendous amusement to one - as other editors are wont to do the same. I refer you to members, Vera, Chuck, and Dave, LessHeard vanU, and Crestville, who have given one a terrific amount of pleasure in the general 'laughing gear' area, because of their inovative choices of Nom de plumes. One can only hope that this practice does not offend one's own sense of normality. One can only live in hope.&#160;:)) <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasegde_c4ec.html" title="User:Andreasegde">Who am I?</a> 20:45, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think pseudonyms are great fun. The Beatles used them all the time, and they can be silly (Dr Winston O'Boogie anyone?), witty (Who Am I?) or just plain weird (George Harrsion's, which I have forgotten, thus rendering my point somewhat impotent). Anyway, in light of your recent post, I resolve to only use pseudonyms forthwith and never again shall I refer to myself as "Crestville". Crestville is dead, and I hereby reign in a new era. I shall be a mecurial being, lacking in shape, only substance, with no fixed title.

<p>Sorry, didn't see your question about this until now -if you want a page protected (actually semi-protected - blocking IP addresses and newly created accounts), you have to make a formal request on the administrators' protection request page. I can tell you how to make the request, but you'll need more than you have, I think, to get any love. Blocking an individual, however, is a matter of his or her breaking rules like violating <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>, or having been warned about vandalism several times, etc. and then someone requesting a user block which I've done numerous times after warnings. I put a first warning note on the user talk page of the IP address who posted that crap inside of my comment above, and if it continues, there may be a case for blocking the address from editing. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/69.38.133.62" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/69.38.133.62" rel="nofollow">This</a> is kind of interesting - rather a one-note dude or dudette, I'd say. About the article itself - personally I'm not thrilled - she makes all kinds of claims, perhaps to sell books, and nothing seems corroborated. (Heavily relying on Cynthia's book when writing about John makes me a little uncomfortable too, for similar reasons, but at least a lot else has been written about him for counter-balance, plus intereviews with him. May seems kind of out there on her own, and neither Goldman on the one hand nor Mintz on the other exactly inspire confidence in their independent thinking abilities.) I re-phrased May in a few places to say that these things are what she claims, but all in all, for what it's worth, it's not my favorite Beatles article. Let me know if you want to pursue sprot and I'll tell you how to do it. Meanwhile, it is totally freezing in NY tonight, which is a rather random comment brought on by my putting on yet another sweater (jumper?) to be able to sit here, inside!

<dd>Good idea - I think I'll have a beer as well. (Sound of can being opened...) I'm working on Julia at the moment, and am using Spitz, but will use Miles and 'Cyn' later. You are right about Cyn's memory - she confused the leather coat (book) Lennon bought her with a suede coat (radio) and made some other glaring mistakes, which I didn't use. Not that bothered about Pang at the moment - was just irritated at vandal.

<dd>Ok, look - this is an excellent article, despite its appalling orthography and lacunae (give some people power and that's what you get - "punctuation" and "gaps" would have worked nicely). We'll correct comma errors, although I thought I had caught them - and we can reduce the numbers of repeat references within a sentence - but predicatbly a lot of the comments are classically ignoring the text to obsess on the length of the dashes. This is a chronic problem in FA/GA requests. The good point coming out of this is that suddenly 10,000 words is only a guideline - we weren't cutting because we thought the article needed cutting, we were cutting because of the arbitrary word limit. So if that word limit is fluid, there's more that can be done with the article if anyone is up to it. There's <s>almost</s> no point in arguing there.

<p>Hate to distract you from distinguishing btwn your hyphens and em-dashes, but I actually have a content question: the Macca article says Northern Songs was formed by someone, Brian Epstein and The Beatles - is that right or is it really someone, Epstein and John &amp; Paul? <strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> 18:58, 27 January 2007 (UTC) [please note - my American instinct was to write "Northern Songs WAS formed." Even though I wouldn't say The Beatles was", ever. What can I tell you.)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, yeah, yeah - but <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Songs_ed7c.html" title="Northern Songs">Northern Songs</a> makes it worse. <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Songs_ed7c.html" title="Northern Songs">Northern Songs</a> intro says that the company was formed by Dick James and Lennon and McCartney, nothing about Brian Epstein. <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beatles.html" title="Beatles">Beatles</a> says the company was formed by Dick James and Brian Epstein, and that Lennon and McC assigned rights to their songs to it. <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_McCartney_c886.html" title="Paul McCartney">Paul McCartney</a> says Northern Songs was formed by Dick James, Brian Epstein and the Beatles, to mainly publish Lennon &amp; McC's songs. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Lennon_7583.html" title="John Lennon">John Lennon</a>, mercifully, is silent on the subject but come to think of it (don't scream) shouldn't we have something in there about Northern Songs? <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_James_a28b.html" title="Dick James">Dick James</a> (and I am still laughing that his name was really Reginald Leon Vapnick which sounds like an old vaudeville joke) says nary a word about Brian, but has him (James) forming Northern with John and Paul. But that's ok because <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Epstein_c309.html" title="Brian Epstein">Brian Epstein</a> says nothing about Dick James or Northern. So.....my guess is that "The Beatles" didn't form Northern with Dick James, it was John and Paul - and I don't know about Brian, but one way or the other we ought to try to make them all consistent. I'll be glad to do it - just tell me what is correct. <strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> 23:15, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The main article comments that Harrison and Starr formed their own publishing companies when the Northern Songs contract expired, so that would point to The Beatles assigning (at least) their publishing rights (and Harrison wrote the fairly pithy <i>Only A Northern Song</i>, which could be considered emperical evidence). I would not think that Harrison, a smart lad, would assign his few songs to a company he had no share in. Also, the early Beatles <i>musketeer ethos</i> would dictate that every band member had a piece. <a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 23:57, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>True - I'll have to ask my husband who was a songwriter back in the day - I don't remember now what standard publishing contracts said. Of course the writers would have had to get writing royalties, but it's the publisher's share that they likely would all have wanted in on. <strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> 00:04, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, Martin could have been a gazillionaire too. (But he probably is, isnt he?) I don't think we need to go into too much detail, at least not on Beatles or McCartney pages, just have the right names attached. Northern, I guess, could have some detail. <strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small></dd>

<p>Anyway: The contract was only for <b>4 years</b>, after which Starr and Harrison set up their own companies. They didn't write much before then so it was good for them. Len and Mac went for the whole hook, line and sinker routine. So:</p>
<p>For every 100 Dollars income:</p>
<p>50% to James for Publishing – 50% to James for Royalties = 50</p>
<p>25% to Len Mac for Publishing – 25% to Len Mac for Royalties = 25</p>
<p><br />
James gets 50 Dollars</p>
<p>Epstein takes 25% off Len and Mac = 12.50 Dollars</p>
<p>Len gets 18.75 Dollars Mac gets 18.75 Dollars</p>

<dd>Right - I get this part - $50 to James, Epstein's cut off of Lenmac comes to $12.50 and Len and Mac each get $18.75. The part I wasn't getting was above that - when you say</dd>
<dd>50% to James for Publishing – 50% to James for Royalties = 50</dd>

<p>Publishing contracts:</p>
<p>A normal contract is 60-40, 70-30, or 80-20 (depending on the level of exertion a publisher is committed to, like getting out of bed in the morning.) Royalties are the big thing (radio plays) because publishing is just music books/sheets, which nobody wants anymore.</p>
