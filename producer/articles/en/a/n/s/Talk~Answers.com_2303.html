<p>There was a section entitled "Mirroring Wikipedia and Manipulating SERPs" -- I don't know what "SERP" means and there was no discussion in that section of any 'manipulation'.</p>
<p>The content appeared to me (and I haven't checked the edit history) to be added by someone pushing a pov against mirrors. The point, if there was one, is that in some cases Answers.com comes up higher in google than Wikipedia does. I fail to see why this is interesting.--<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 22:32, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree that this image was tacky. But I'm surprised that you don't consider this fact "interesting" (although it may not be appropriate for the article). Doesn't most of Wikipedia's traffic come from Google and other search engines? Wouldn't this trend in Answers' rankings have an impact? If we start linking to Answers.com and their tools, won't their relative rankings only increase more?</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/s/Talk%7EAnswers.com_2303.html" title="Edit section: Mirroring Wikipedia and Manipulating SERPs (Search Engine Result Pages)&quot;">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mirroring Wikipedia and Manipulating SERPs (Search Engine Result Pages)"</span></h2>
<p>Today I brought back the "Mirroring Wikipedia and Manipulating SERPs (Search Engine Result Pages)". I believe it is important to let wiki users know that Answers.com is the only website that is currently indexed by the search engines that shows duplicate entries for Wikipedia article -- see two screenshots. I resized them to make the article look better.</p>
<p>Answers.com currently is the only major <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> mirror still ranked by Google. Even though many pages on Answers.com are dominated by Wikipedia content they are included in the <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a> index and ranked high in the search results.</p>
<p>For example, take a look at <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Bristoe+Campaign%22" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Bristoe+Campaign%22" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Bristoe+Campaign%22</a>.</p>
<p>Another example is <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Abu+Ghraib+torture+and+prisoner+abuse%22" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Abu+Ghraib+torture+and+prisoner+abuse%22" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Abu+Ghraib+torture+and+prisoner+abuse%22</a>. Both examples only have Wikipedia content and they are beating Wikipedia in the rankings.</p>
<p>On one hand, Answers is a site of questionable value, everything it has is copied from other sources, all of them freely available. They do not create any content but rather assemble somebody else's work, drive lots of traffic by dominating the Google index with duplicate content and selling this traffic with lots of ads. If this site disappears from the Net, nothing will be lost in terms of publicly available content. It is hard to see how it is beneficial for the Wikipedia project that many users go to Answers while actually looking for the content that was created on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>The business model of Answers is a very well done combination of techniques called site scrapping and index SPAM. This may sound too harsh for a good looking website, but that what it really is behind the hood.</p>
<p>On the other hand, they spend a small portion of their ad revenue on donations to wikimedia and have created a very good PR for themselves. It seems the question is whether anybody can buy their way into preferential treatment by the wiki board so the opinion of the user community is ignored and distorted? [unsigned contrib from Wiki is the future]</p>

<dd>Some of us believe it is important to note answers.com's dependence on us but no one else outside of this community cares. The POV is based on original theory and research.

<p>"In the same fashion, if the most-available entry is an encyclopedia entry, Answers.com displays a commercial data feed, before an old version of Wikipedia.

<dd><i>Why such a focus on Wikipedia? Why should answers.com be compared to WP?</i> Perhaps because Answers.com relies heavily on Wikipedia for its content, gives Wikipedia minimal credit, has a donation button for "wikimedia" which is really just themselves, and makes a lot of money off of advertising. Pretty sleazy on their part, if you ask me... <a href="../../../j/c/b/User%7EJcbutler_a250.html" title="User:Jcbutler">Jcbutler</a> 16:35, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Do the donation really go to themselves? When I clicked on the link to make a donation to wikimedia from the answers.com page it took me to <a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Fundraising" class="external free" title="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Fundraising" rel="nofollow">http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Fundraising</a>. I agree that they make a lot of money off of advertising but there's no law against that. I hate seeing wikipedia's "property" being used by other websites for profit too, just on the principle that the user isn't getting the same quality wikipedia experience, but I think we may have set ourselves up for this by freely contributing our edits for free. I guess we just have to find some kind of solace in the idea that maybe, just maybe, someone out there who only uses answers.com to get their info is benefiting where they otherwise would not. --<a href="../../../c/d/o/User%7ECdogsimmons_4903.html" title="User:Cdogsimmons">Cdogsimmons</a> 17:36, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Which version of each individual Wikipedia article does answers.com display? For example, does answers.com just take a snapshot of Wikipedia at a point in time, or do they edit Wikipedia content so as to improve on it?

<dd>Let me try to answer your question better than Henrygb. If Answers.com is not adding value, it won't get hits, ad revenue will decline and it will go bust. If it adds value, by compressing content from various sources and outscoring Wiki on Google, users will tolerate the ads and it will profit accordingly. If entries have errors, as you suggest, users will come to see this and punish the site with fewer hits. The cream rises to the top, in that teachers the world over are pushing Wiki, not Answers.com, for the very reasons you suggest. Even if you think Answers.com entire business model depends on sneaking up the Google rankings, remember Google stands to lose by promoting weak content and can be punished by users just as quickly. In short, (market failure resulting from) market power is only a problem where barriers to entry are sufficiently high, as they are generally not on the internet. Wiki has nothing to fear from Answers.com. In any event, Henrygb is right in that this entire discussion has no place in the article until we can show its taking place outside our community.

<p>Well I was the one who added info on this article claiming that answers.com does take information from wikipedia. When you see the info on the article in answers.com it has the the heading wikipedia and then information but this doesn't exist in all articles. Some articles are purely answers.com and some are just having a part of source from both. Visit this article and you will see what I mean, <a href="http://www.answers.com/starcraft" class="external free" title="http://www.answers.com/starcraft" rel="nofollow">http://www.answers.com/starcraft</a>. It has at the top, Wikipedia. Am I right or am I wrong?</p>
<p>To conclude I see no reason to remove the section I put as when looking at the answers.com database. It at the top, Wikipedia. Which means they want to interpret this as wikipedia source information so I will add the source back.</p>

<p>Is Blufr.com a relevant external link or not? Sure its "powered" by answers.com, but if thats the case, wouldn't we need links for the sites "powered" by geocities?

<blockquote>
<p>I do not think the link should be removed because blufr is not merely "powered by" but is rather a product created by the company and also appears embedded on its homepage. They are vitally connected and so adding it as a link seems fair and perhaps not even enough.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do not see any relevance between blufr and a page about Answers.Com. The site does not give any obvious information about either Answers.Com, or the topics generally raised in the original article. You might as well add a link to every company owned by GM on the GM Wiki page. I would say remove it, since the content is not relevant to the article. 72.161.163.15 15:23, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Someone asked an interesting question, which didn't get answered. Does answers.com donate to Wikipedia, and if so how much? I appreciate that Wikipedia has nothing to lose from answer.com's use of its articles, but on the other hand, answers.com benefits enormously from Wikipedia's free content. So it would seem to me grossly unfair if it didn't contribute financially. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalefire_eaed.html" title="User:Palefire">Palefire</a> 08:05, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>We should compare Wikipedia articles to their Answers.com counterparts and should add the additional information on Wikipedia.
