<p>The area of what is now southern West Virginia was long a hunting ground for nomadic tribes of <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States_7838.html" title="Native Americans in the United States">Native-Americans</a> before the arrival of Europeans in the 17th century. Around 1790, the area now known as Ansted was settled by a group of Baptists who did not hold legal title to the land. These people were known as "squatters," and built the Hopewell Baptist Church nearby. In 1792, a 400 acre (1.6 km²) tract of land in the area was patented to Charles Skaggs.</p>
<p><a href="../../../f/a/y/Fayette_County%2C_West_Virginia_6b85.html" title="Fayette County, West Virginia">Fayette County</a> was created in 1831. The first county court was held that same year at Miles Manser's general store which stood nearby along the <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_River_and_Kanawha_Turnpike_93fa.html" title="James River and Kanawha Turnpike">James River and Kanawha Turnpike</a>, an early roadway built to connect the canals on the <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_River_%28Virginia%29_33d0.html" title="James River (Virginia)">James</a> and <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kanawha_River_7fb6.html" title="Kanawha River">Kanawha Rivers</a>. The area was known at that time as Mountain Cove. At various times, it has been known as Woodville, New Haven, and Westlake also.</p>

<p>During the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>, the area of Fayette County was a focus of both <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_%28American_Civil_War%29_fad6.html" title="Union (American Civil War)">Union</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederate_States_of_America_b8e1.html" title="Confederate States of America">Confederate</a> efforts. The burning of <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gauley_Bridge%2C_West_Virginia_ae26.html" title="Gauley Bridge, West Virginia">Gauley Bridge</a> was a spectacular event long-remembered in the community. During the winter of 1861-62, the Chicago Gray Dragoons of the Union Army were based at the Halfway House (Tyree Tavern) in what is now Ansted. At this time, Confederate General <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_E._Lee_733b.html" title="Robert E. Lee">Robert E. Lee</a> maintained headquarters on nearby Sewell Mountain. The Chicago Dragoons had a strong religious orientation and ties to the <a href="../../../y/o/u/Young_Men%27s_Christian_Association_82ab.html" title="Young Men's Christian Association">Young Men's Christian Association</a> (YMCA) of Chicago. Many Union troops felt they were fighting the moral issue of <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavery.html" title="Slavery">slavery</a> while although many citizens of Fayette County were more sympathetic to the "states rights" issues of the Confederacy. The area became part of the new <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Virginia_4016.html" title="West Virginia">State of West Virginia</a> when it was formed in 1863 as part of the Union. Local lore speaks of romances between the local girls and the young soldiers from <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illinois.html" title="Illinois">Illinois</a>. Some of these young couples married and built homes and raised their families in the Mountain State at the end of hostilities. It is also the burial site of <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stonewall_Jackson_8320.html" title="Stonewall Jackson">Stonewall Jackson</a>'s mother.</p>

<p>After the Civil War, the United States renewed its westward expansion. Around 1872, the new <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chesapeake_%26_Ohio_Railway_d0a8.html" title="Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway">Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway</a> was built along both sides of the narrow <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_River_2507.html" title="New River">New River</a> valley nearby creating a through route to the <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio_River_8c4c.html" title="Ohio River">Ohio</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mississippi_River_e27c.html" title="Mississippi River">Mississippi Rivers</a>.

<p>Also in 1873, the town of Ansted was created. It was named after a British <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientist.html" title="Scientist">scientist</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geologist.html" title="Geologist">geologist</a>, Dr. <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_T._Ansted_65e2.html" title="David T. Ansted">David T. Ansted</a>, who stalked out the nearby seams of high grade <a href="../../../b/i/t/Bituminous_coal.html" title="Bituminous coal">bituminous coal</a> and once owned the land the town now occupies. The town was laid out by former <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederate_States_of_America_b8e1.html" title="Confederate States of America">Confederate</a> Colonel George W. Imboden, a wealthy lawyer. His second wife, Angie, renamed their family home "Contentment" because she and her family spent many happy hours there. Contentment had been built about 1830 on the <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_River_and_Kanawha_Turnpike_93fa.html" title="James River and Kanawha Turnpike">James River and Kanawha Turnpike</a> in the west end of what is now Ansted, and they acquired it in 1872. Col. Imboden, who was Ansted's first <a href="../../../m/a/y/Mayor.html" title="Mayor">mayor</a>, helped stimulate the growth of the town's businesses.</p>
<p>Another of the town's more well-known residents was a protégé of Dr. Ansted, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_N._Page_50f6.html" title="William N. Page">William Nelson Page</a>, (1854-1932). A <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_engineer.html" title="Civil engineer">civil engineer</a>, he was one of the energetic and successful men who helped develop West Virginia's rich <a href="../../../b/i/t/Bituminous_coal.html" title="Bituminous coal">bituminous coal</a> fields in the late 19th and early 20th century. Page was co-founder and builder of the <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginian_Railway_25f5.html" title="Virginian Railway">Virginian Railway</a>. In 1898, on a knoll in the middle of town, Page had a palatial mansion built by Gauley Mountain Coal Company carpenters, where he and his wife <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emma_Gilham_Page_1b70.html" title="Emma Gilham Page">Emma Gilham Page</a> raised their four children. Like Colonel Imboden, William Page also served as a mayor of Ansted for 10 years, although his title of "Colonel" did not result from technically attaining that rank, although he was active in the West Virginia State Militia. The nearby railroad town of <a href="../../../p/a/g/Page%2C_West_Virginia_385f.html" title="Page, West Virginia">Page</a> was named for him.</p>
<p><a name="Narrow_gauge.2C_branch_of_C.26O_serves_Ansted" id="Narrow_gauge.2C_branch_of_C.26O_serves_Ansted"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/s/Ansted%2C_West_Virginia_ae36.html" title="Edit section: Narrow gauge, branch of C&amp;O serves Ansted">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Narrow gauge, branch of C&amp;O serves Ansted</span></h3>
<p>Ansted had railroad service from 1874 until 1972. In 1874, mine owners had a narrow-gauge railroad built from Hawk's Nest Station up the ravine of Mill Creek. A saddleback locomotive was used. In 1899, the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chesapeake_and_Ohio_Railway_33a2.html" title="Chesapeake and Ohio Railway">Chesapeake and Ohio Railway</a> (C&amp;O) purchased the <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narrow_gauge.html" title="Narrow gauge">narrow gauge</a> railroad and contracted with Col. Page to do the work to upgrade the line to <a href="../../../s/t/a/Standard_gauge.html" title="Standard gauge">standard gauge</a>, which was completed on August 20, 1890.</p>
<p>The (C&amp;O) operated the new branch line, which was known as the Hawks Nest Subdivision from 1890 until 1972. It connected with the New River Subdivision main line at Hawks Nest Station and consisted of 3.44 miles of line to and beyond the town of Ansted. The line had one of the steepest grades of any C&amp;O branch, a 4.17% grade. C &amp; O did not desire to transport passengers on the line, but was ordered to do so by the State of West Virginia. Passenger service was finally operated on the branch line following a decision of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Supreme_Court_e75f.html" title="United States Supreme Court">United States Supreme Court</a> in <i>Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway Company v. Public Service Commission of State of West Virginia</i>, 242 U.S. 603 (1917), and continued until sometime in the 1930s. The freight rail service on the branch line ended in 1972 and the tracks were removed.</p>
<p>Today, the Ansted-Hawks Nest Rail Trail follows the route from the Town of Ansted down the steep mountainside to the area of Hawks Nest Station in the New River Valley. The trail is 2.2 miles in length and terminates where the <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerial_tram.html" title="Aerial tram">aerial tram</a> from Hawks Nest Lodge departs their passengers.</p>

<p>Today, Angie and George Imboden's 1830 home, Contentment, still stands. The Contentment Historical Complex serves as headquarters for the Fayette County Historical Society. It features a historical museum and restored one-room schoolhouse, with historic furnishings and household items dating to mid-nineteenth century.</p>
<p>The mansion of William and Emma Page and their family on the hilltop in Ansted also still stands as evidence of the once-thriving coal business.
