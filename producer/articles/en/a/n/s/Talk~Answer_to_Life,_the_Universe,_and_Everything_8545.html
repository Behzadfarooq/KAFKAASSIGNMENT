<dd>Well, the thing is that maybe Douglas Adams chose 42 through subconcious of his own name, or maybe he decided to commemorate himself in his book and then thought - no, that's too cocky, I'll pretend I made it up. Anyway, though people often say unpleasant things about numerologists (a group to which I don't actually feel I belong), I first worked out Douglas - Adams = 41, then on noticing that the subtracted Adams was 38 realized that D. Adams must be 42. That was all I worked out, so I did not spend ages searching for something that would fit. I think it belongs, but before I revert I am willing first to discuss it, so that if I'm wrong I may hopefully realise. Oh, and just to show how weird the world is, in a recent Ham Radio contest I scored 43. I was slightly miffed at the last one working me in the last minute or so. But I didn't refuse to work him - I'm not some 42ology fanatic. <a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPhase_Theory_d0e1.html" title="User:Phase Theory">CMIIW</a> 21:13, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's a nice coincidence, but it's only a coincidence. There DOES exist a radio interview where he stated that he realized that the joke had to be that he could summarize The Answer into a number, and then just had to choose a number. He ruled out odd numbers, integer numbers, then remembered that John Cleese had faced a similar decision when making one of his Video Arts training films - to make a long story short (too late!), Adams said he vaguely remembered that Cleese decided the funniest number to hear a banker come up with after having ignored a customer would be "42." Adams reused it, and the rest, as Henry Ford would say, is more or less bunk (yes I just pinched another joke there). --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnDBuell_751c.html" title="User:JohnDBuell">JohnDBuell</a> 21:19, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't mean to disgrace Adams, as he is one of (IMHO) the best writers I have come across, but how do we know that he really didn't have a question, and then regret it because it was immodest, rude, sick, insensitive or any one of a wide variety of other reasons? It need not be a coincidence. (Anyway, when one talks about coincidences relating to h2g2, one must consider that two of the islands on Damogran are called Easter Island and France, and what Adams has to say about that). My point though is fundamentally: It is every bit as relevant and notable as the computer programmers' SIX * NINE thing. Once a precedent has been set, either follow the precedent, or don't, but apply rulings universally. If 1+5*8+1 is relevant and notable, then so is D. Adams = 42.

<dd>"D. Adams = 42" is something that was made up just recently by you, which is the very essence of non-notability. If you want consistency, look in the history of this talk page for other people who have been desperate to find some meaning in the number 42 who also didn't get their ideas in the article. By the way, what you're doing isn't <a href="../../../c/r/y/Cryptography.html" title="Cryptography">cryptography</a> by any stretch, it's <a href="../../../n/u/m/Numerology.html" title="Numerology">numerology</a>.</dd>
<dd>Also, if the stupid computer programmers' "joke" is what's encouraging this stuff, that sounds to me like a great reason to take it out of the article.</dd>

<dd>Well, if two people say it's bad and no-one but me likes it, ok then, keep D. Adams=42 out, and keep 1+5*8+1 out as well. But I didn't say this was numerology, I said it was a cryptographers' joke. Few people other than cryptographers assign numeric values by alphabetical order. Numerologists (and kabbalists) tend to use the Hebrew or Greek number systems where a=1 b=2 etc but j=10 k=20 l=30 and so eg Sadam (with one daled) is in the Hebrew system 60+1+4+1+600=666. That's numerology. D. Adams=42 is neither cryptography nor numerology, it's just a bit of clean amusement, and I did indeed consider it acceptable because of the computer programmers' joke. <a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPhase_Theory_d0e1.html" title="User:Phase Theory">CMIIW</a> 17:02, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Has anyone related the number 42 to the number of pips on a pair of dice?

<p>Why is it left with the answer from afda when the most widely accepted (and documented) one is the link to the John Cleese video arts one? I read afda around the time the post was made and it was very much posted just to shut people up as there had been so much speculation in the froup. I don't think he really meant it and most people didn't believe it. Gusty42 14:09, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ok, now that I've remembered my password: I've fought for "Where does it all end?" for a few years now, so I've re-added it. Please think it through before deleting. Virtually anything can be tied to 42, and while "Goodbye, and thanks for all the fish" is most certainly Douglas Adams' bible-code style cryptographic reference to the upcoming sequal to <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Fairlane_%28movie%29_299a.html" title="Ford Fairlane (movie)">Ford Fairlane</a> starring <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonard_Nimoy_52bd.html" title="Leonard Nimoy">Leonard Nimoy</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/u/Pauly_Shore_cd24.html" title="Pauly Shore">Pauly Shore</a>, I'd hesitate to think that even he could fail to see the connection between the very last use of the number in the entire series and the only question a cynic need ever ask.

<p>Maybe I'm taking this too literally, but is it really likely that the reason for Douglas Adams saying that 6*9=42 is anything more than him saying that the universe is fundamentally flawed? Not really a suggestion for the article though...</p>
<p>Or maybe it is? Maybe it could be rephrased more cynically about the other suggestions? Sven945 23:53, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The joke in the original radio episode/book is pretty clearly meant to be that the Earth's entire existence had been a waste of time because the question had gotten cocked up. Since Adams later states no-one can know both answer and question, this is the only explanation that fits.</p>

<p>The whole series may be a joke - that would fit pretty well with the whole thing. It is possible that Adams gave a stupid answer with no question, just to, as it where, piss us off. The point of the series may be that it is impossible to know the meaning of Life, the Universe and Everything, because, after you do, the universe (Or your universe, as Arthur discovered in <i>Life, the Universe and Everything</i>; like Descartes, the universe is only what you make of it) is destroyed, which is why the planed Earth was destroyed all those times.</p>

<p>Just a useless piece of trivia:-</p>
<p>I once actually wrote a (fairly epic)love poem titled "42" based on the "Answer to life, the universe and everything" (as at that point in my life the girl in question meant just that to me). The structure of it was that every line seemed contradictory in some way. I'd post it on here but it probably wouldn't be appropriate and the only copy I had has been lost through the mists of time. Strangely I can remember the last verse though...</p>
<p>The past as it will be. The present as it was then. The future as it is now.</p>

<p>Google lists this article as being 42 kilobytes: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=the+answer+to+life+the+universe+and+everything&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=the+answer+to+life+the+universe+and+everything&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?q=the+answer+to+life+the+universe+and+everything&amp;btnG=Google+Search</a></p>
<p>Mmmm. Food for thought.</p>

Since this is useless trivia to begin with, I just thought I'd note that this article bears a striking resemblance to the articles on <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a>. -magfrump</p>

<p>The United States has had 42 Presidents under the Federal Constitution.</p>
<p>Also, combined, the ancient Israelite Kingdoms had 42 kings.</p>
<p>Does this mean the end of time is upon us?</p>
<p>Food for thought.</p>

<p>More food for this thought: there were 42 generations from Abraham to Jesus (Matthew ch 1). Also, in Revelation 12, the woman who, after gave birth to the child which was taken up to heaven, fled to the wilderness for 1260 days (42 months), and the beast which came out of the sea (Revelation 13) made war with the Christians 42 months.

<p>I think it would be worth noting that when one searches "the answer to life the universe and everything" in Google, the Google Calculator gives you the answer of "42." Try it for yourself. REscano 17:29, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello,I do not even know who I am talking to,but here is the problem.It seems for a long time now that every time I look up I see this number.I swear I think there is an answer to my question,WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?WHAT DO I NEED TO BE LOOKING FOR?I have been seemingly haunted by this number for a long while.If this raises any kind of forum,please let me know. [e-mail address removed] .....thanks</p>
<ul>
<li>Try noticing some other similar numbers, like, say, 44 or 48. They'll show up just as often. You only notice 42 because you're already looking for it. Also remember that the Hitchhiker's Guide is humorous fiction, so don't expect it to reveal any deep truths about the universe. <a href="../../../r/s/p/User%7ERspeer_418c.html" title="User:Rspeer"><b><span style="color: #63f;">r</span><span style="color: #555;">speer</span></b></a> / <a href="../../../r/s/p/User_talk%7ERspeer_a656.html" title="User talk:Rspeer"><span style="color: #555;">ɹəəds</span><span style="color: #63f;">ɹ</span></a> 03:10, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>The very first time I read this book, I was ten or twelve years old. I remember thinking that since the time of Earth's computation was nearing an end, the question <b>as present in the subconscious mind of Arthur Dent</b> was almost in its final form, requiring only computational precision to be fully accurate. To me, that meant the question would actually have been, WHAT DO YOU GET IF YOU MULTIPLY SIX BY SEVEN, with the answer being, of course, 42.</p>
<p>However, the implications of <b>WHAT DO YOU GET IF YOU MULTIPLY SIX BY SEVEN? 42.</b> did not hit me until I pondered adding my voice to this <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">auspicious cacophony</a>. You see, Adams' humor was very British; dry, intellectual, with a deep melancholy behind it. If my speculation matches Douglas Adams' intent, it also matches the general theme of the book: that life is, at its heart, mundane, impersonal, and ultimately unsatisfying.</p>
<p>Yes, I did say mundane. Despite multifarous alien species on millions of worlds, despite the wacky humor and multiple jaunts through space and time, the Hitchhiker books are about how everoyone in an <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Bang_a993.html" title="Big Bang">accidental universe</a> faces a lifetime of disappointment and disillusionment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Once Arthur Dent learned to understand the language of the birds, he realized it was all the most mundane kind of talk -- air velocity, location of food sources, etc.</li>
<li>The immortality of reincarnation is marred, once a person realizes their life will end again and again and again, often in the most meaningless ways.</li>
<li>The original planet of humans was depopulated through lack of telephone handset sanitizing.</li>
<li>Even The Almighty apologized for screwing up.</li>
<li>The Vogons win.</li>
</ul>
<p>No wonder Marvin was depressed. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueNight_546f.html" title="User:BlueNight">BlueNight</a> 05:20, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
