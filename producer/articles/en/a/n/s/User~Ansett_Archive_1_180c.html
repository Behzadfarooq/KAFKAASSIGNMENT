<p>Thanks for uploading Image:Ansett Transport Museum.jpg. Wikipedia gets hundreds of images uploaded every day, and in order to verify that the images can be legally used on Wikipedia, the source and copyright status must be indicated. Images need to have an <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">image tag</a> applied to the <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_description_page_4215.html" title="Wikipedia:Image description page">image description page</a> indicating the copyright status of the image. This uniform and easy-to-understand method of indicating the license status allows potential re-users of the images to know what they are allowed to do with the images.</p>

<p>If you want to reference the content, I suggest you firstly identify what it is you want to reference and then include a summary of that content there - eg fleet or whatever. The site you added is in a domain run by <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokelau.html" title="Tokelau">Tokelau</a>. It is not therefor the original Ansett site and may or may not be an accurate mirror - it is not clear what the site's purpose is and thus even whether or not it is reliable. A reliable source woud be with reference the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Archive_a5d5.html" title="Internet Archive">Internet Archive</a>.

It seems to be that all images are from copyrighted websites. You need to provide links from where the images were copied, and provide correct licensing. For example with <a href="../../../k/_/m/Image%7EK_mrken.jpg_e6a2.html" title="Image:K mrken.jpg">Image:K_mrken.jpg</a>, it doesn't seem to me that you made that yourself - so you need to explain where you got it.

<p>OK. So you were blocked for constant copyright violation. To release the block we need to know that you are not going to violate copyright. Your response on that would be appreciated. If you agree not to upload any more images for a time (at least a month or until the problems with the existing ones are sorted out) and you agree not to take text from copyright sources let me know and I will release the block.</p>
<p>Now, for starters, the images you uploaded (there are more but these will do for the time being):</p>
<ul>
<li>Image:Image of Sir Reginald Ansett.jpg. A company owns the copyright, but you have given it a Creative Commons license - why? Was that a mistake? Do you own the image? What is the story there?</li>
<li>Image:Gunyong.PNG. You say you made it yourself, but it seems to be a commercial logo. You copied the logo using a paint program? What is the story there?</li>
<li>Image:Gunyong.PNG. You say you made it yourself, but it seems to be brilliant and done by a professional. Perhaps you are a professional, I don't know - what's the story there? Also, the photo has no meta-data. If you took the photo yourself using a digital camera the meta data would help identify that it is not stolen.</li>
<li><a href="../../../k/_/m/Image%7EK_mrken.jpg_e6a2.html" title="Image:K mrken.jpg">Image:K mrken.jpg</a>. A brilliant image. I'm struggling to see how you own it. Perhaps you do, could you convince me please.</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps you do own and are willing to release all these images. If that is case I am sorry. But I think you will agree it's of for me to check the copyright in these exceptional circumstances.</p>
<p>So please respond about the images. I'll talk about text after that or soon.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommander_Keane_ca6f.html" title="User:Commander Keane">Commander Keane</a> 10:47, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Commander Keane,</p>
<p>I created the section to make my plea, but you got to the page before I could put it in.</p>
<p>I can now categorically say I have learnt my lesson. I will never again violate any policies set by Wikipedia. I feel I am very creative and that I have a lot to offer the Wikipedia community.</p>
<p>Please note: I entered in error that some of these image were my own.</p>
<ul>
<li>Image:K mrken.jpg is an image from a deceased owner.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Image:Gunyong_Valley_Logo.PNG is a logo. I did not create it. At the time I uploaded it to Wikipedia I did not know there was a Licensing bar for logos - If I had of known I would have used it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The other two image from Gunyong Valley (Including Image:Gunyong.PNG) article were screen shots from the official website.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Image:Image of Sir Reginald Ansett.jpg is taken from an Ansett website. I have contacted the webmaster of that site and they said that it is for anyone to use. (The person in the photograph is no longer alive. The copyright is unknown by the webmaster) The Creative Commons license on the image was a error.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Image:Ansett_Gunyong_Valley.JPG This is one I took myself! (Do you like it? Not my best) Please remove it as I am not willing to give it a Free license.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can easily see on Gunyong Valley article I put in the official website as a link. If I was being deceptive, I would not have put the officall link in so it could be discovered that SOME of the content was a "COPYRIGHT VIOLATION".</p>
<p>Thanks for all your help Commander Keane!</p>

<p>I didnt say it was spam, I said it looks like spam. I also believe it doesnt satisfy the notability criteria for companies as set down in <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. That is why it has been nominated for deletion. If you think otherwise, feel free to point out why on its AfD page. Alterntively, feel free to contact me to discuss the matter. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViridae_a0d4.html" title="User:Viridae">Viridae</a> 11:56, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

I have no idea which edit Viridae is talking about, but usually you do just remove spam and self promotion.

<dd>Further comment: The article (which you created) has been nominated for deletion (as you well know). Blanking the page is not going to help the vote be decided.

If you have any further questions, please feel free to leave a note on my talk page, I will be happy to help. However can you please refrain from deleting content from wikipedia.

<dd>From the .tk article, because your page (and yes I know it is yours) is one of thousands of .tk pages, there is no need for it to be there. Furthermore, I don't see why the article needed an aexample - and even if it did, that is spam. From the airline page, you listed an unofficial "fansite" about a defunct airline. If you want to put a link in - do it for one of the major world airlines like BA, Singapore Air or similar. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViridae_a0d4.html" title="User:Viridae">Viridae</a> 13:16, 26 June 2006 (UTC)
