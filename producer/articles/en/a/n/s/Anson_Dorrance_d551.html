<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/s/Anson_Dorrance_d551.html" title="Edit section: Early career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early career</span></h2>
<p>Dorrance was born in <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bombay.html" title="Bombay">Bombay</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> on April 9, 1951, the son of an American oil executive. He spent his youth moving with his family throughout Europe and Africa. Of all the places he lived, three had particular influences on his later life. In <a href="../../../a/d/d/Addis_Ababa_a075.html" title="Addis Ababa">Addis Ababa</a>, <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethiopia.html" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>, he met his future wife, M'Liss Gary, the daughter of the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Air_Force_e341.html" title="U.S. Air Force">U.S. Air Force</a> <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attach%C3%A9.html" title="Attaché">attache</a> to Ethiopia. He attributes his love of soccer to his years living in <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenya.html" title="Kenya">Kenya</a> and finally, he gained his education from the boarding school, <a href="../../../v/i/l/Villa_St._Jean_International_School_0a63.html" title="Villa St. Jean International School">Villa St. Jean International School</a>, in <a href="../../../f/r/i/Fribourg.html" title="Fribourg">Fribourg</a>, <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switzerland.html" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a> from which he graduated in 1969.</p>
<p>After graduating from Villa St. Jean, he moved to the United States and attended a small community college in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Antonio_20a5.html" title="San Antonio">San Antonio</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a>. He transferred after the fall term to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_North_Carolina_at_Chapel_Hill_49d1.html" title="University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill">University of North Carolina</a> (UNC). His love of soccer led him to walk on with the school's men's soccer team, then coached by Marvin Allen, where he was a three time All-ACC player. In 1974, he graduated with a <a href="../../../b/2E/a/B.A._90b2.html" title="B.A.">B.A.</a> in English and Philosophy. That year, he also married his boyhood sweetheart, M'Liss Gary.</p>
<p>Under the influence of his father, Dorrance entered the University of North Carolina's law school, but dropped out in 1976, when Marvin Allen convinced Dorrance to succeed him as the UNC men's soccer coach. From 1977 until 1988, Dorrance compiled a 175-65-21 (.708) record with the team. His greatest success came in 1987 when he led them to the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_Coast_Conference_a463.html" title="Atlantic Coast Conference">Atlantic Coast Conference</a> (ACC) championship and the NCAA Final Four. That year, he also won NCAA Men's Soccer Coach of the Year honors.<sup><a href="http://graphics.fansonly.com/photos/schools/unc/sports/m-soccer/auto_pdf/uncsoccer4.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://graphics.fansonly.com/photos/schools/unc/sports/m-soccer/auto_pdf/uncsoccer4.pdf" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/s/Anson_Dorrance_d551.html" title="Edit section: UNC Women's Soccer Team">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">UNC Women's Soccer Team</span></h2>
<p>In 1979, UNC expanded Dorrance's duties to include both the men's soccer team as well as the newly established women's team. It was this event which moved Dorrance into the limelight. Within two years, Dorrance had guided his Lady Tar Heels to the 1981 <a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_for_Intercollegiate_Athletics_for_Women_39d6.html" title="Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women">Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women</a> (AIAW) title. When Dorrance began coaching the Lady Tar Heels, the NCAA did not have a women's soccer championship. When the NCAA showed no interest in establishing one, Dorrance and University of Colorado coach, Chris Lidstone, approached the AIAW, who proved receptive to the idea. After the AIWA led the way, the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association_2404.html" title="National Collegiate Athletic Association">NCAA</a> finally recognized women's soccer as an inter-collegiate sport and Dorrance's teams proceeded to dominate the sport. His teams won every championship from 1982-1984 and again from 1986-1994. After winning the 2006 NCAA championship, the youngest in school history, the Tar Heels have claimed a total of 19 national championships and 18 of the 25 NCAA championships.</p>
<p>Dorrance's success comes from several inter related attributes. First, he has an eye for recruiting outstanding talent. Related to that is his emphasis on competitiveness. He noted early in his time as a women's coach that women seemed to have an inhibition against open competition. He decided to develop an atmosphere at UNC in which women were rewarded for having an aggressive desire to win. Finally, he noted from his work with both the men's and women's team that women tended to play best in an atmosphere which focused on relationships.</p>
<p>Dorrance was able to bring out his player's aggressiveness and competitiveness while also fostering an almost family sense of the team. Regarding the aggressiveness, <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Clara_University_e9a3.html" title="Santa Clara University">Santa Clara University</a> women's soccer coach Jerry Smith noted in a 1998 <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sports_Illustrated_9f1c.html" title="Sports Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a> article, "When you watch them, you can see the edge they have. I'll go beyond aggressiveness. It's meanness. Anson has found a way to bring that out of his players." <a href="../../../m/i/a/Mia_Hamm_e77b.html" title="Mia Hamm">Mia Hamm</a> added in the same article, "I grew up always good at sports, but being a girl, I was never allowed to feel as good about it as guys were. My toughness wasn't celebrated. But then I came here, and it was O.K. to want to be the best."<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Players know Dorrance supports a high level of competitiveness and this has given him an edge in recruiting talented high school players. However, he also strives to create an atmosphere of family with his players. This includes the use of first names, including his own, and the traditional presentation of a red rose to each senior before their final home game. He also writes personal notes to his players complimenting them and thanking them for their performances.</p>

<p>In 1998, it appeared that Dorrance may have overstepped the bounds of creating a close-knit environment. That year, a minor player, Melissa Jennings, sued him for sexual harassment. Dorrance had just cut her from the team. Initially, it appeared the suit was retaliation against Dorrance. However, when Debbie Keller Hill, a former team captain, joined the suit, it gained greater legitimacy.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> In October 2004, U.S. District Court Judge N.
