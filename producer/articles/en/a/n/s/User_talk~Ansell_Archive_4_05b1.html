<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ref tag</span></h2>
<p>There are multiple ways of citing data in Wikipedia. See <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html#Citation_styles" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE#Citation_styles</a>. One way is to use ref tags, and another ways is to use Embedded HTML links (see the above link). No one way is inherently better than others, and it is best to remain consistent. The <a href="../../../b/a/b/Bab.html" title="Bab">Bab</a> article does not use &lt;ref&gt; tags. -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 00:36, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>While still being consistent, it is possible to convert the entire system to use the tags. They have the extra information which is useful for a proper citation, such as the accessdate and title information in standardised forms. Why would it not be better to convert the entire article to that formatting, given its technical advantages? <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 00:40, 2 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The Embedded HTML Links still does that. You give the link in the page, and then the full reference at the bottom, and that is how the BBC article is linked. The full reference including access date is there. --- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 00:45, 2 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>What advantages are there to giving the reference twice, and not having backlinks from the reference section to where the citations are given? <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 00:46, 2 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If you have access to all the books that have been used as references over the history of that article, go ahead and convert the whole article to ref style. I don't have most of the books, and can't do it. If you go to ref style without citing the rest of the books that are in the current references, those references would disappear (or the page would use two styles, and not be consistent). -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 00:50, 2 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't have access to them as far as I know, (may be in university library) however, it may be prudent to have someone thoroughly check the article against the references in the process of converting to the ref format. There is a compromise where a Notes section is added above the References section in which the inline citations using the ref format are added. I would be willing to convert the current inline citations to this style if it is acceptable. I do not see the two section mechanism as inconsistent at all, especially if the {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_7db3.html" title="Template:Cite">cite</a>}} set of templates are used for them all. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 00:56, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As I am well versed in the topic, everything in the article is verifiable, I just don't currently have the books to change the article to ref style, which I have to other articles (see the <a href="../../../b/a/h/Baha%27i_Faith_be4d.html" title="Baha'i Faith">Baha'i Faith</a> article which I changed to ref style about a month ago (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_Faith&amp;offset=20060606021631&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_Faith&amp;offset=20060606021631&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>). I am, however, a fan of consistensy, and those pages which use both a Notes and References section, mostly use the References section as a Further Reading section, and don't use the References section to back up statements in the texts. Most of the references in the References section actually do use the {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_7db3.html" title="Template:Cite">cite</a>}} style, (check it out), so I don't see any need to introduce an inconsistency in referercing in the article. -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 01:10, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If you are happy putting in references manually intext and doubling the entries at the bottom then it is not a huge thing, but converting the article should be done reasonably soon in the future as it makes life much easier, and keeps consistency ultimately (if you use the same template throughout) after it is done the first time. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 01:16, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If you feel strongly, go ahead and change the reference structure for those embedded links. I won't revert them, but I don't feel it's necessary given the current consistent style of referencing, so I'm not going to do it. -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 01:18, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My reasons for changing them are both from the ease of multiple referencing point of view for ensuring consistency of the citation style and for being able to easily reference the same thing multiple times in an article via the name parameter. If I were to go and do it now I would convert the books referenced to {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_book_c666.html" title="Template:Cite book">cite book</a>}} and the inlines to {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_web_57d4.html" title="Template:Cite web">cite web</a>}} which have not too dissimilar styles, however, in order to not introduce inconsistency with the list at the bottom I would have to make Notes and References sections at least for now, even though as you point out they have slightly tangential aims, it would avoid the prospect of having half of the reference list backlinked and the other half not. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 01:24, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ansell, I noticed you doing some edits to the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_FIFA_World_Cup_controversies_d339.html" title="2006 FIFA World Cup controversies">2006 FIFA World Cup controversies</a> page. The issue with the references is minor compared to the issue with neutral point of view. I have gone through and reworded a number of the sections, and all of them need it done to. If you could work towards neutralising the article it would be most appreciated. References are easy enough to find at the moment, just go to news.google.com and search for them. Except for the Ghana vs US one which turns up some 400 odd results.

<dd>What I am doing has little to do with the neutral point of view, although I am removing unneutral/unreputable references at the same time. It is just a janitorial task to convert them.

<dd>What is the obvious bias in the fork that would be removed by having the main page?

I still think the article has a right to exist based solely on the size of the main article, 52K compages to the 32K recommendation is enough to persuade me of that. If the worst comes to the worst at least let me copy the references over from the forum onto this page before deciding on the placement of the section, it is easier to edit where it is now. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 11:31, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

One external link will remain as long as the current situation is not abused or the sockpuppetter is found to run the forum.

<p>I have to say, this is really starting to irritate the absolute hell out of me. The number of people that keep telling me to assume good faith while at the very same time completely <b>ignoring</b> good faith themselves is getting beyond a joke!!! In fact, its reaching the point of being catastrophically <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypocricy.html" title="Hypocricy">hypocritical</a>.</p>
<p>Mr Tom Harrison clearly stated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Tom_harrison#Third%20Revert" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Tom_harrison#Third%20Revert" rel="nofollow">HERE</a> an I quote:</p>
<p><i>"No, there was no accident. I saw your edit, thought it was not an improvement, and changed it back. I don't think it warrants an extended dabate on the talk page. Write up a 3rr report if you want; as you say, mine was the third revert. You can have the last word if you want it."</i></p>
<p>Not only did he fail to show good faith, fail to check the recent edits, fail to check the talk page to see that discussion as going on... but he did it because he felt <b>his</b> views were more important than anyone elses. Now I get <b>you</b> coming in here shoving "what you did didn't assume good faith" in my face while doing <b>exactly</b> that in the process!!!! I am struggling to remain civil when people horrendously fail the very thing they walk around snobbing everyone else for. So in the most politest and civil manner I can muster at this time, please check your facts before spouting off and please in future try not to be so unbelievably hypocritical when you feel the urge to admonish other people. Why not lead by example and <b>show</b> some of that <i>"good faith"</i> you seem to think I am lacking.</p>
<p>Let me ask you someting? What on earth possessed you to throw "good faith" in my face and not for a moment consider whether you were doing the same thing? Did it simply not occur to you at all? Or do you believe you are beyond such mistakes? Was it an oversight? <i>(Note now I am assuming good faith in at least giving you an excuse for your actions)</i> Or do you go around blindly telling everyone else what to do while ignoring it yourself? So please BACK OFF, your hypocricy is seriously offensive and inflamatory...</p>

<dd>Okay... Maybe its time for a wikibreak. It was just a link, let someone else take care of it. Dont get yourself tangled up over it. Please do tell how it is possible to assume good faith about someone else accusing someone else of bad faith. Seems illogical. How is informing you of the dangers of your edit summary hypocrisy?...

<dd>The way in which you "informed me of the dangers" was to start with the supposition that I had indeed done the wrong thing. That does not show good faith does it? So to tell me that I am not using good faith, while failing to use it yourself is what makes you hypocritical. Had you followed the link or read the background you would have found the evidence you were trying to pull me up on. Simply put, it was the way in which you approached it, clearly showing no good faith at all and admonishing <b>my</b> lack of good faith in doing so. Is it that difficult to understand? <a href="../../../e/n/i/User%7EEnigmatical_a9c5.html" title="User:Enigmatical">Enigmatical</a> 23:08, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As far as I was concerned I was neutral in the issue until you brought "bad faith" accusations into it. I was simply warning you of the dangers of your accusations, whether they were true or not.

<dd>Let us enter into a phase of review. Your words were very clear and very precise: <i>Your use of this in your edit summary here did not assume good faith</i>. Are you telling me this statement was a warning? Perahps my understanding of english is seriously lacking but that sounds very much like a judgement with absolutely no room for error nor any "warning" at all. Its a statement of fact as far as you are concerned. Secondly... The amount of discussion is not important, whether it was started or whether it had been going for a while does not grant one the right to blatantly ignore the fact it was there and still make the change anyway. Lastly... <i>"Do you have that evidence"</i>. I clearly showed you that I did and yet you are still here trying to argue the point that you have not in any way been hypocritical. Now you try to justify your actions by saying it was only a warning. For future reference, it may be worthwhile starting such statements with "Just a warning" because some people are unable to work out what your intentions are when they are not actually stated in your comments. Oh and it might be nice that instead of quibbling over things you just admit you made a mistake instead of now trying to validate your actions.... but I guess people just do not do this kind of thing any more. When they are right they are right, when they are wrong they are somehow absolved due to "technicalities" like a discussion "hardly" being "discussed properly". So sorry the discussion didn't meet your minimum requirements for being considered worthy.

<dd>Mmmm... Still seems like you are too stressed out and need a Wikibreak. I am not going to "admit" I was hypocritical because I don't see anything I did as being that. Your review convieniently put away the fact that you weren't getting your way on the CSD talk page and you have a comment about someone challenging you to take the issue to 3RR, which you gladly did. Hardly seems like you have the moral high ground to argue from. In terms of whether it was technically a warning or not, well, maybe it should have been considering my further analysis of the issue. It is against policy to accuse someone of bad faith edits (as you did), when you are in the middle of a content dispute, which hadn't even been close to consensus.

<dd>Just a couple of things to round this discussion out. I am not, nor ever have claimed a moral high ground, in fact I am perfectly happy admitting that I can get things wrong and can often assume bad faith. What I find intolerant however are people who <i>(as you are doing now)</i> seem to be above such things and claim they never do anything wrong. That you cannot see your own bad faith in accusing me of it shows there is no need to continue the discussion. Oh and FYI, I didn't take the matter further when "challenged" to on the 3RR rule, because the other person was an administrator and had clearly shown that they knew they had the upper hand. No point in trying to do that to an administrator, they always win even if they are in the wrong <i>(which I realise was not the case and totally my error)</i>. No wikibreak needed here, and I do find it a little insulting for you to make such a suggestion but I will assume you had the best of intentions. In future, please just put a little more consideration into things before you go accusing other people of things... you may just find you are not as squeeky clean as you would <i>like</i> to think. <a href="../../../e/n/i/User%7EEnigmatical_a9c5.html" title="User:Enigmatical">Enigmatical</a> 04:21, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Your removal of speedy delete tags</span></h2>
<p>You recently removed speedy delete tags from NSAMC, claiming that it asserted notability. However, this is an internet forum with <a href="http://s11.invisionfree.com/NoStaringAtMyCrotch/index.php" class="external text" title="http://s11.invisionfree.com/NoStaringAtMyCrotch/index.php" rel="nofollow">66 registered members</a> and a page that's chock-full of unsourced claims. By looking at your userpage, I don't see any indications that you're an administrator, so you really shouldn't be removing speedy delete tags because you think an acceptable reason to delete the article doesn't apply. I'll assume that you were acting in good faith, though. <a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabricationary_b588.html" title="User:Fabricationary">Fabricationary</a> 08:47, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I will have to assume you were acting in good faith also, although, you seem to misunderstand what my rationale for it not being a speedy candidate were. If an article asserts "any" level of notability it is no longer a speedy candidate under the criteria you are claiming, it must go to either Prod or to AfD after that. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 08:50, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I've nominated plenty of things for speedy delete before that claim notability but lack it. The article is now listed at afd.

<dd>Ansell, I just stumbled across this discussion on your talk page. I think you're both right (or wrong). Articles should never be speedied if there is the least chance that someone on the planet (other than the original author) might disagree. I think the article in question would have at least two people (you and me) objecting to speedy deletion. I tend to think it's an iffy article, but PROD is the right way to go (better than AfD). The right way to interrupt the speedy deletion is to follow the instructions on the tag:</dd>

<dd>I think admins can resurrect the dead if they've dispatched them too quickly. Something like this happened to me and two other editors trying to help a newcomer with a new article; see <a href="../../../s/t/a/User_talk%7EStaxringold_Archive4_8f23.html#feedback_on_your_ADARSH_SAMAJ_SAHYOG_SAMITI_deletion" title="User talk:Staxringold/Archive4">User talk:Staxringold/Archive4#feedback on your ADARSH SAMAJ SAHYOG SAMITI deletion</a>. Staxringold got the article back ASAP (and graciously) when we pointed out his mistake. I think the New Pages patrollers are encouraged to move very quickly and err on the side of a few innocent dead -- this is necessary to keep up with the flood of new articles.<br />

I know about the encouragement to be quick for tagging, however, there is no such encouragement for the admins deleting the pages, they have 5 or more steps to do for each page, and it seems like they are not all being done. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 03:54, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, I have simply followed the same methodology used by other templates that have been moved into the user space. It may be worthwhile contacting those who first started it and sharing your 2c with them. <a href="../../../e/n/i/User%7EEnigmatical_a9c5.html" title="User:Enigmatical">Enigmatical</a> 22:16, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"What is a semi-vandal?" Is that a loaded question? The user is attempting in my view, to define the difference between using rollback for blatant vandals and not in content dispute cases. I assume there is a point to the question though, even if I cannot see it myself. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 08:06, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've never actually heard the term before. I'm interested in his reasoning behind classifying a user as a semi-vandal. I also wanted to know what he felt made an edit have no value (I think this is important). I really didn't have any "motives" behind asking the question. Did it come out wrong? Sorry if this is confusing. I just woke up.&#160;;) <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><font color="DarkSlateGray"><b>Alphachimp</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b><font color="black">talk</font></b></a></sup> 11:35, 13 July 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Image:Referee Graham Poll.jpg</span></h2>
<p>I tagged it for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The image is not a promotional image. The page it comes from may be considered promotional, but the image is part of the content and is not part of a press kit or otherwise marked as free for distribution. It appears the image is only licensed for use on the Kent Referees' Association website.</li>
<li>You have to describe why exactly the use of the photograph qualifies as fair use.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think you are mistaken about the use of the "promotional" tag. Images used for promotional purposes are not necessarily freely distributed images. <a href="../../../y/t/n/User%7EYtny_f220.html" title="User:Ytny">Ytny</a> 05:09, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am a total stranger to the whole fair use scenario, being an Australian and technically having to work under an american copyright situation here which is foreign, literally, to me. I placed the tag somewhat naively upon checking it off by the tag. As you say, it is not explicitly released as a media item and therefore is under doubt for its fair use. I also did not realise that I had to explicitly write a free use statement, although it was probably there in the upload window and I mistook it for something else, like the tag and web references. If someone could find a high quality free image for the Graham Poll article it would be great.

<dd>I do think the fair use and other copyright tags could be a lot clearer. I see a lot of people use promotional for the same reason you did because it's not explained adequately. As for finding a free image of Graham Poll, it might be tricky - news services are pretty tight with their copyrights and not too many amateurs are going around taking pictures of referees. I'll look around though. <a href="../../../y/t/n/User%7EYtny_f220.html" title="User:Ytny">Ytny</a> 17:26, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
