<p>Yes, you may not be able to view Tamil fonts, because you may have not enabled Tamil font support in your OS. You can enable Indic scripts in your computer to view Tamil Unicode by adjusting OS settings. If that is not sufficient, you might have to install a Tamil Unicode font such as Latha.

I have read all the sources that <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerspicacious_39a9.html" title="User:Perspicacious">Perspicacious</a> has quoted and no where is there a statement classing Adventists as a cult.

<dd>I was looking at the sources he quotes on the talk page and contributing as you were writing these messages. I did not see that they were plagiarism. I dont believe that either everythingimportant.org or equip.org are notable references in his case. However I am reluctant to revert the entirety of his vandalism just yet. I need to look into the sources he references on that main page before I can do any of that. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_ca11.html" title="User:Ansell">Ansell</a> 07:04, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

What actually intrigues me is how they all explicitly say that the denomination is not cultic. Has he read the sources himself? <a href="../../../m/y/n/User%7EMyNameIsNotBob_b89a.html" title="User:MyNameIsNotBob">MyNameIsNotBob</a> 07:32, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I dont think they would be acceptable. One of them is as you point out plagiarism. Another of them is his personal website, that has been rejected before and will not be acceptable now. As I said, one of his references actually says that the Adventist church is evangelical, however he is using it as a chief piece of evidence in his case. The bit about the seven faces of adventism from his site is more than funny, he actually thinks that fits in the first paragraph. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_ca11.html" title="User:Ansell">Ansell</a> 07:42, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Feel free to improve on the article by editing the version reverted by you and removing all the POVs.

<dl>
<dd>I have re-written the section without emphasizing on IIT Brand and deleting reference to "brand image". The POV status of the rest of the section seems acceptable as it mentions both the fact that IIT Brand exists and that it is a "hindsight bias". Are any more improvements necessary. Have a look and share your comments. -<a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbuj.Saxena_7172.html" title="User:Ambuj.Saxena">Ambuj Saxena</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/b/User_talk%7EAmbuj.Saxena_ee93.html" title="User talk:Ambuj.Saxena">talk</a>) 15:24, 6 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You seem to be right, the brand image is an established fact. The hard part now is putting this down in an NPOV manner if possible (the alternative being putting more than one contrasting POV). I will have a look at it and make some adjustments to it as an outsider. I think the Factors behind success section header should stay though (as you have kept it in the revised version) <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_ca11.html" title="User:Ansell">Ansell</a> 00:16, 7 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, I think it was good that you reverted it. In the flow of things (and under the influence of my own beliefs), I used descripters like <i>best</i>, which should be avoided. I think further neutralization of <i>IIT Brand</i> was also necessary, even though its a popular concept. -<a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbuj.Saxena_7172.html" title="User:Ambuj.Saxena">Ambuj Saxena</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/b/User_talk%7EAmbuj.Saxena_ee93.html" title="User talk:Ambuj.Saxena">talk</a>) 04:36, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Per your requests saying <i>Citation Needed</i>, I have added a few sources. But I am not sure whether they are acceptable as the point is reaffirmed only subtly. For example, in an article I cited from Economic Times, it quotes a student saying he got a lot of respect in US and "...when you goes to an MIT or a Stanford and finds that the whole class looks at you differently on finding out that you are an IITian, that’s when it hits you." Is it good enough or should I go looking for better. -<a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbuj.Saxena_7172.html" title="User:Ambuj.Saxena">Ambuj Saxena</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/b/User_talk%7EAmbuj.Saxena_ee93.html" title="User talk:Ambuj.Saxena">talk</a>) 09:20, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>An act of congress sure is a big help to your case. The news articles, being Indian, possibly aren't the best, but they are not bad.

<p>Hi, saw the edits you made sometime back on the IIT article. There are a few minor problems with it. Firstly, the IIT Location map was initially placed on top (as has now been done by you), but I moved it down as one of the editors told that there should be a picture in the lead. Secondly, one of the sentence edited by you now reads: "Many IITians have proceeeded to successful careers in industry, resulting in the establishment of the <i>IIT Brand</i>, considered to be a benchmark of academic excellence within the region." I believe that by "within the region" you mean India. But this is not clear in the sentence. If you wanted to mean something else, then also it needs to be edited as the meaning is not clear. Thirdly, one of the sentence now reads: "Cultural festivals are organized by individual institutes." Reading this someone will feel that "Cultural festivals" is a proper noun, while actually its a common noun. I think a minor edit needs to be done to that sentence also to avoid confusion. Other edits were just fine. -<a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbuj.Saxena_7172.html" title="User:Ambuj.Saxena">Ambuj Saxena</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/b/User_talk%7EAmbuj.Saxena_ee93.html" title="User talk:Ambuj.Saxena">talk</a>) 05:23, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Change the image locations to what you think is the best. I was mostly moving around the images so they didn't clash with both other images or other headings. Unfortunately the Alumni heading is still clashing with a picture. I think there may be too many pictures on the page if we can't make them fit. Of course, I have a widescreen so images take up more vertical room compared to text but if you rely on having a small screen then its still a sign its too crowded. Tried to correct the two other problems you point out above. Not sure whether they are okay yet but I tried. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_ca11.html" title="User:Ansell">Ansell</a> 06:07, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am afraid for a few days we have to face more problems. The government has announced reservation upto 49.5% in IITs and hence people are flooding the articles on politicians with vandalism. The IIT page also had a share of problems with a person adding details of the problem. Although done in good faith, it was way longer than should have ideally been. So streamlining the article is going to be a bit difficult. Just keep a watch on potential vandals and overly enthusiastic users. -<a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbuj.Saxena_7172.html" title="User:Ambuj.Saxena">Ambuj Saxena</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/b/User_talk%7EAmbuj.Saxena_ee93.html" title="User talk:Ambuj.Saxena">talk</a>) 07:07, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What does "reservation up to 49.5%" mean? Is this a tax related matter? Thanks for the notice. Will be watching it as well as trying to get it up to FA status with respect to POV and grammar still. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_ca11.html" title="User:Ansell">Ansell</a></dd>

<p>Well, let me explain in detail, though this explaination is also bound to have some POV issues. India, since long has had discrimination related problems where certain sections of the society known as <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dalit_%28outcaste%29.html" title="Dalit (outcaste)">Dalits</a> (euphemism Harijans) were discriminated against. When India got independence, the need was felt to bring these people into the mainstream economy by giving them incentives. These incentives were given in the form of reservation of such people in government jobs and in educational institutes. Originally it was meant to last 10 years, after which it was to be withdrawn. But the trouble is that since 50% of India belonged to SC/ST/OBC, it was politically incorrect decision to withdraw this (from elections point of view). Also, reservation were extended to Muslims and other minorities in what is seen as appeasement in order to get votes. So what should have stopped 40 years back is still continuing. What's more, every govt. tries to appease them even more by increasing the reservation. How the IITs implemented it is written in detail in the article as its significantly different from other institutes. However, now the govt. is planning to enforce quota system, where 49.5% of the seats will have to be filled from students of these categories rather than selecting them on the basis of merit only. If you want to learn more, explore Wikipedia and if some confusion remains, I will be happy to help. BTW, if you want to see what is happening to the politician's article who brought this decision, have a look <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arjun_Singh&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arjun_Singh&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">here</a>. -<a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbuj.Saxena_7172.html" title="User:Ambuj.Saxena">Ambuj Saxena</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/b/User_talk%7EAmbuj.Saxena_ee93.html" title="User talk:Ambuj.Saxena">talk</a>) 09:11, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Outside"</span></h2>
<p>This is a simple matter of grammar, and what you find easier to say isn't relevant (though I have no idea why you find it difficult to say "outside Europe"...). "Outside", in this context, is a preposition, and doesn't need another preposition (any more than does "inside"). --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 16:15, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I guess this one comes back to a bit of a personal history of articulating prepositions like that. I am not <i>overly</i> stressed about the point. But in order to demonstrate that it seems more accurate to at least me I have done it. If you think in your wisdom that it is better that way then remove it. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_ca11.html" title="User:Ansell">Ansell</a> 00:11, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While I know you are editing, what are your thoughts on the changes I made to the "Sabbath" section and how could they be improved.

<dd>Just made some edits to the sections that you were editing the other day. I still don't fully appreciate the significance of the edits you made with relation to the introduction, but I tried to make it encyclopedic, rather than like reading out of adventist history and heritage class notes&#160;;-). I think there may still be content in the article that is doubled up, not the least of which is the accusations about salvation by works being in two or more places at the same time.

<dd>I don't have any experience with the science fiction part of wikipedia. The article is well referenced. If it ever goes to a Peer Review I would be interested in reviewing it. Just reading down it, the structure is clear and it reads well on scanning. I made one small edit, but generally a large review of just grammar and spelling and it looks good enough to put to a Peer Review.

<p><i>"In future you will note that your votes will be disregarded if solicited as Morton did. He thinks the process is just a straw poll. Its actually a consensus discussion."</i> As you probably saw on my talk page, I voted differently from the way he expected me to vote! But I did read the article and the comments before I voted. I didn't vote "for" or "against" what he wanted, I made up my own mind. I was surprized that I was asked to vote on this article, since I don't think I've ever heard of him before and I haven't done any edits to political articles, except for fewer than five minor edits. I don't think I've given much (if any) hint of a political stand anywhere.

This may have been the first time I've been invited to vote (not sure), and the warning about that which is on the page now was not on there at the time. I din't think I was really aware of that. A while after I voted I did add a comment below my vote explaning that I had been asked, and that I didn't feel strongly, and hadn't been editing these type of articles.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Why I Feel Qualified to Vote for Keep/Delete Afd</span></h2>
<p>You asked on my discussion page why I am qualified to vote on Afd. Quite frankly because of the principals of community that Wikipedia is founded upon. I have read the guides on proposed qualifications for keeping or deleting articles. I know enough that I don't expect my voice to be the one and only used in judgement of what stays and what is destroyed, rather that my voice is representative of one faction of the community and that in fairness all factions should have voice. Certainly there are those within the community that feel themselves to be more qualified than others to pass judgement and that everyone who disagrees with them is wrong, I see that as vigilantism and not in line with the edict of good faith which should guide decisions on Wikipedia. I've never painted a great work of art, but I feel qualified to voice whether I think a painting is good or not. I've never writen a song, but I feel qualified to voice whether I think a song on the radio is good or not. I have never writen an article on Wikipedia but I feel qualified to voice whether I think the articles meet the stated purposes and guidelines of Wikipedia. I appreciate you asking. &#160;: ) <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonesomedovechocolate_52d8.html" title="User:Lonesomedovechocolate">Lonesomedovechocolate</a> 22:58, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Excellent answer! Thanks for replying. I can be a little forward when suggesting things as I did on your talk page, however, it is nice to know that people here on wikipedia can handle those comments with a mature attitude. Puts a bit of faith in this place. Thanks for putting your voice in to AfD, its not something I always get around to and its nice that the regulars over there have someone with a good knowledge of the policies in their midst.

<p>Hi there. It is in the final hours, but could you give me a few examples regarding my lack of ability to distinguish between vandalism/content disputes, as you said. Other than the Rx Strangelove comments, which I feel were debated to the max, the concerns you raised are quite heavy - a few new examples would help.

<dd>I have kind of thought a bit since I wrote that comment. And I think the uncertainty in your record doesn't make you a firm candidate in my mind. It is nothing personal. Just that you don't have much concrete support behind your vandalism removal edits, which makes bad reversions stand out so much more. I haven't had that much experience myself, but I have tried to explore all facets of wikipedia to get a feel for it. And I still don't think I am near the standard considered proper for adminship. I am too rash generally, although thats improving.&#160;:) Keep trying even if this one doesn't succeed.</dd>

<p>Hello. Generally it is probably not a good idea to lobby for AfDs and RfAs, but seeing as I participated in the last two, and probably because I voted delete - they contacted me.

<dd>They are understandable reasons for having people contact you about these things. It was actually a pretty neutral statement, I guess I am a bit up tight about vote stacking in these things. The current nom being the third in 6 weeks also kind of seems like an abuse of the AfD system. If there was no consensus on the last two then the system should focus on matters that are more pertinent. The article can't be that bad if there wasn't a consensus to delete twice in a month. Still, thats not the reason you commented here so I should comment somewhere else about that. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_ca11.html" title="User:Ansell"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#009000;">e</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/s/User_talk%7EAnsell_90fe.html" title="User talk:Ansell"><span style="color:#0000FF;">ll</span></a> 01:39, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have left a note for the blocking admin on their talk page. I don't think this a controversial block - it's just simple vandalism I imagine. What you should do is contact your uni's tech support and see if they can track down who made the vandalism (use the IP's contribs etc).--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommander_Keane_ca6f.html" title="User:Commander Keane">Commander Keane</a> 07:07, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This actually looks really weird.

<dd>Every one of those edits were <b>self-reverted</b> within 1-2 minutes. How is this long-term vandalism, admittedly, it looks like one person out of the 40,000 students at QUT likes to do this vandalism/self-revert vandalism process. Why should this block the other 39,999 students off. It isn't like they are permanently manipulating content. For a university proxy particularly this seems a bit extreme to classify as anything more than a joke. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_ca11.html" title="User:Ansell"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#009000;">e</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/s/User_talk%7EAnsell_90fe.html" title="User talk:Ansell"><span style="color:#0000FF;">ll</span></a> 22:49, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Would it be possible for a representative of QUT to investigate the supposed vandalism by a student, likely by the name of Bryan Galliford? The links to the evidence are presented below, note in your investigation that although the user changed the page back to the original within minutes, this is still thought of as vandalism by wikipedia, and results in a block on the entire campus for editing, even for editors who register a user name.</p>
<p>Statements such as this were placed and then removed: "BRYAN GALLIFORD IS A GOD!!!"</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">H3 vs Wikipedia Headings</span></h2>
<p>Ansell, I'm a bit confused by your desire to use H3 tags instead of Wikipedia's wiki headings. I assumed someone with knowledge of HTML, not Wiki-markup was editing, and thus moved the Wikipedia-style headings -- I didn't know the use of H3 was intentional -- sorry. The source of my confusion is that, at least on my browser and Wikipedia configuration (Firefox 1.5/whatnot), the H3's show up in the table of contents just like the HTML tags. Is there something I'm missing? <a href="../../../k/k/i/User%7EKkinder_2eb7.html" title="User:Kkinder">Ken</a> 16:24, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I thought they wouldn't show up... I didn't think to check the TOC to make sure they wouldn't! Thanks for pointing that out. Revert that back to wikimarkup. Mind you, im using the same browser config, but i dont think it is that. I am the one who missed something. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_ca11.html" title="User:Ansell"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#009000;">e</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/s/User_talk%7EAnsell_90fe.html" title="User talk:Ansell"><span style="color:#0000FF;">ll</span></a> 23:03, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>When I originally placed the H3 tags in there on the main page, it was to reduce the size of the TOC.

It's nice to see a few isolated voices of sanity on an issue that has been causing me a lot of wiki-stress recently. It looks like the "cabal" of wikipologists will prevail this time (as is the nature of the <a href="../../../a/d/v/Adverse_selection.html" title="Adverse selection">adverse selection</a> of DRV), but the responses of a few experienced wikipedians (yourself included) prevented me from taking a very long hiatus from the project over this issue. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">savidan</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/v/User_talk%7ESavidan_3fd9.html" title="User talk:Savidan">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">(e@)</span></a></sup> 22:35, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Its a shame that I didn't get to it when it was on CfD. The cabal pretty much rule because they are the ones who find it necessary to trawl through these things.

<p>Hi Ansell. According to the New Oxford American Dictionary, supersede is the standard spelling of the word. It goes on to mention "The spelling supercede is recorded as early as the 16th century, but is still regarded as incorrect."</p>
<p>You're quite right about dependant/dependent: I'll be more careful with it in future.</p>
