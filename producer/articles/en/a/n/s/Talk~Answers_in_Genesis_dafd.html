<p>Does anyone know what is going on with the name? The Canadian office of AiG has replaced its sign with "Creation Ministries International". <a href="http://www.creationontheweb.com/content/view/4067" class="external text" title="http://www.creationontheweb.com/content/view/4067" rel="nofollow">This site</a> describes CMI as doing all the same things that AiG is doing, including publishing 'Creation' magazine. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 13:43, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Due to irreconcilable differences in opinion over certain operating procedures, AiG and AiG International (Australia) split. The parent organisation became CMI. Per the article: <i>In February 2006, Answers in Genesis USA became independent (together with the UK office), retaining the brand name and the website. The Australian office, along with the Canadian, New Zealand and South African branches, rebranded as Creation Ministries International. CMI continues the publication of Creation and Journal of Creation and now has a website under that name. Answers in Genesis publishes books and multimedia resources, as well as a website featuring articles and papers. In June 2006 Answers in Genesis is launching an American alternative to CMI's Creation Magazine, named Creation Answers. It will no longer be distributing the former magazine in America. Answers in Genesis is also expanding into the non-English speaking world with translations and outreach ministry.</i> <a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/about/history.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/about/history.asp" rel="nofollow">look here too</a><a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrometheusX303_4aad.html" title="User:PrometheusX303">PrometheusX303</a> 17:36, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Answers in Genesis was an umbrella organization for organizations based in Australia, the United States, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa. The United States group split off from the rest and appropriated rights to the name and domain name (from the Australian group). The remaining groups have changed their names to Creation Ministries International.

<li><a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobindch_8937.html" title="User:Robindch">User:Robindch</a>: the cite I requested was for the argument itself, not the facts of the argument. Wikipedia policy states that it is not permitted to refute a position without providing a 3rd party source for that refutation. Please take a look at points 5 and 6 of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html#What_is_excluded.3F" title="WP:OR">WP:Original Research#What is excluded?</a>.

<li><a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshmoo_727a.html" title="User:Ashmoo">User:Ashmoo</a>: can you tell me exactly what citation is appropriate here in place of the one that I've added? As you're no doubt aware, Ham, along with most creationists, claims that Stalin accepted evolution and that he derived his evil from it. Both claims are untrue, as Stalin rejected evolution for political reasons, and promoted the opposing theory of Lamarck, through his support for Lysenko. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobindch_8937.html" title="User:Robindch">Robindch</a> 16:25, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>We shouldn't even be getting into 'refuting' an organisation's views while we are in the process of describing them, with or without a cite. Counterarguments belong in the appropriate section.

<li>Fair 'nuf. I've removed that section and inserted it into the 'criticisms' section, together with one other sentence which refutes further false allegations from AiG. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobindch_8937.html" title="User:Robindch">Robindch</a> 18:38, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I don't understand. Moving it to another section doesn't negate the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">Original Research</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiability_beed.html" title="WP:Verifiability">WP:Verifiability</a> problems. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshmoo_727a.html" title="User:Ashmoo">Ashmoo</a> 22:35, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The text I've added is neither original nor unverified research, as the conclusion I write is contained within the Wikipedia entry on Lysenko to which I've already linked. Removing my recent edits from the 'criticisms' section (added there as DJ suggested, and you agreed), would also logically require the removal of the remainder of the section's text, together with chunks from 'Controversy over interview with Richard Dawkins', 'Definitions, probability and natural selection', 'The Creation Museum' and elsewhere. To do so would reduce the page to being a facsimile of the AiG website which would be useful for nobody. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobindch_8937.html" title="User:Robindch">Robindch</a> 23:25, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Please take a look at points 5 and 6 of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html#What_is_excluded.3F" title="WP:OR">WP:Original Research#What is excluded?</a>. Unless a citeable 3rd party has refuted AiG's claims regarding Evolution and Communism by invoking Lysenko, it counts as <a href="../../../o/r/i/WP%7EOriginal_Research_47d3.html" title="WP:Original Research">WP:Original Research</a>. The Richard Dawkins section rightly attributes any criticism to Aust Skeptics.</dd>
<dd>Having another look through the 'Definitions, prob...' section, it seems like it suffers from unsourced comments too. I'll look into it. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshmoo_727a.html" title="User:Ashmoo">Ashmoo</a> 23:45, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Added a citable 3rd party which refutes the claim that Stalin accepted evolution. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobindch_8937.html" title="User:Robindch">Robindch</a> 01:40, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I hate to be a pain about this, but the cite provided is about 'Evolution and Chance', not 'Evolution and Communism'. The cite must make the assertion that it is supposedly supporting, not just mention it tangentially.</dd>
<dd>The give-away in the sentence is the phrase <i>'AiG's claim ... is rejected since...'</i> . Who rejects it? If you can't say who, it is OR. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshmoo_727a.html" title="User:Ashmoo">Ashmoo</a> 02:36, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I totally agree with <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshmoo_727a.html" title="User:Ashmoo">Ashmoo</a>. To say "it is rejected" is POV since it assumes the point-of-view of those who disagree with AiG. The same applies to the paragraph immediately after the Stalin one. I was about to remove them but I'll wait and see if someone can find an attribution or a cite. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 15:46, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Added link to the author of 3rd party article which refutes the claim that Stalin accepted evolution. (note to Ashmoo + DJ: the refutation is contained within the article text, not the article title). BTW, it is neither OR, nor a point-of-view that Stalin rejected evolution, but a point-of-historical-fact. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobindch_8937.html" title="User:Robindch">Robindch</a> 21:10, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../l/a/m/Lamarkism.html" title="Lamarkism">Lamarkism</a> is a form of evolution, so the question is between Darwinian evolution (which says the main driver of evolution is replication &amp; natural selection) and Lamarkian evolution (which says the main driver is inheritence of acquired traits). Stalin didn't reject evolution, he rejected Darwinian evolution, is favour of pseudo-Lamarkian evolution.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>AiG claims Stalin's support for Darwin directly resulted in "<i>oppression, self glorification, atheism and murder</i>"<a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v10/i4/stalin.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v10/i4/stalin.asp" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and that "<i>Hitler was wrong. Stalin was wrong. Darwin’s theory, upon which those tyrants based their actions, was wrong, too.</i>"<a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v27/i2/darwin.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v27/i2/darwin.asp" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>). 3rd party citation on TO states that Stalin did not support Darwin but Lamarck. As you correctly point out, Lamarckism and Darwinism are different. Hence the AiG claim is refuted and may therefore legitimately be included in the 'criticism' section as it stands. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobindch_8937.html" title="User:Robindch">Robindch</a> 00:31, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The talkorigins source provided says that Stalin rejected 'Darwinism', not evolution. I think we need to get this sorted out before we can productively continue.<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshmoo_727a.html" title="User:Ashmoo">Ashmoo</a> 23:28, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't believe that anybody interprets 'Darwinism' as meaning anything other than 'Darwinian Evolution', so I think it's quite clear what the author claims Stalin was rejecting.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Also, the links to John Wilkin's site point to his homepage. Did you have a specific article in mind? As it is unclear what point it is supposed to support. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshmoo_727a.html" title="User:Ashmoo">Ashmoo</a> 00:06, 26 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I linked to answer your query "<i>Who rejects it? If you can't say who, it is OR</i>". The link contains a reference to a page which references the page on TO, confirming that JW is indeed the author and that the refutation therefore originates from a reputable source, as you also requested earlier on.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>(a) Unfortunately, taking the AiG quotes and the TalkOrigins quotes and synthesising them to show that AiG is wrong counts as Original Research (not incorrect, just OR). You need to provide a cite for someone who specifically states: 'AiG is wrong about Stalin supporting evolution'. Not just that 'Stalin didn't support Darwinism', but that 'AiG is incorrect in asserting that Stalin supported Darwinism'. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshmoo_727a.html" title="User:Ashmoo">Ashmoo</a> 01:28, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>(b) Concerning the John Wilkins cites: The article no longer says 'is rejected' so my previous comment is no longer relevant. Unfortunately, it now says 'modern historians', and Wilkins isn't a historian. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshmoo_727a.html" title="User:Ashmoo">Ashmoo</a> 01:34, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>(c) And 'Darwinism' means 'Darwinian evolution'. But 'evolution' doesn't necessarily mean 'Darwinian evolution'. It could also mean 'Lamarkian Evolution'. And it <i>is</i> a POV to say that Stalin rejected evolution. Many would argue that he rejected 'Darwinian evolution' but not 'Lamarkian evolution'. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshmoo_727a.html" title="User:Ashmoo">Ashmoo</a> 03:00, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>(a) AiG claims X, based upon Y. JW claims Y is false. It is not synthesis to cite JW's claim to Y's falsity as constituting a refutation of X. (b) JW's homepage, referred to above, quotes him as having recently completed a PhD in the department of History and Philosophy of Science at the University of Melbourne, from which we can conclude that JW can be counted as a <i>modern historian</i>. (c) As before, in current usage, <i>evolution</i> alone refers to Darwinian Evolution alone (see the second para of the WikiPedia entry <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> which makes this clear).

<dd>Just a quick note, before I get onto the main points. Editing other people's comments on talk pages, even if it is for formatting and readability is considered poor form, as it makes it appear as if the original editor wrote things in a way that they didn't. Not a big issue, but I thought it did need to be said. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshmoo_727a.html" title="User:Ashmoo">Ashmoo</a> 22:44, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>(a) This is exactly what the no synthesis rule is supposed to stop. Please see<a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html#Synthesis_of_published_material_serving_to_advance_a_position" title="WP:OR">WP:OR#Synthesis of published material serving to advance a position</a>. ie. AiG said A, Wilkins said B, therefore C (AiG wrong) (b) I can accept this. (c) Yes, 'evolution' generally means 'D. evolution' but when we are directly comparing Darwinian evolution and Lamarkian evolution we can't then assume or use 'evolution' as a shorthand for Darwinism. The fact that we are arguing about intrepretations of the source material, shows, IMO, that this whole bit is Original Research.</dd>
<dd>More generally, talkorigins has published hundred of refutations of AiG positions and articles, to focus on one of the few things they haven't <i>explicitly</i> debunked seems odd. Wouldn't it be better to include direct criticisms that they've made, thus avoiding any OR challenges from me, and more importantly, all the editors who come after me?

<dd><i>Answers in Genesis seems to display a hypocritical position on the subject of slavery. While encouraging a literal interpretation of the bible it ignores Leviticus 25:44 - “Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you; from them you may buy slaves. You may also buy some of the temporary residents living among you and members of their clans born in your country, and they will become your property. You can will them to your children as inherited property and can make them slaves for life.” Answers in Genesis does not endorse slavery despite their literal interpretation of the Bible.</i></dd>

<p>The following paragraph in the <a href="../../../a/n/s/Answers_in_Genesis_dfcc.html#Definitions.2C_probability_and_natural_selection" title="Answers in Genesis">"Definitions, probability, and natural selection"</a> is rather ambigious, contains incorrect statements, and generally needs some work:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Answers in Genesis has written a number of articles about <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_selection.html" title="Natural selection">natural selection</a>.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> They state that "<i>...It cannot be stressed enough that what natural selection actually does is get rid of information.</i>", citing one example of natural selection removing genes for short fur in cold climates.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> This view is not shared by the mainstream scientific community, which holds that mechanisms such as <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene_duplication.html" title="Gene duplication">gene duplication</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polyploidy.html" title="Polyploidy">polyploidy</a> are examples where new information is available for the selection of new functions. On the other hand, Answers in Genesis claims that polyploidy and gene duplication do not constitute new information, just a duplication of information that was already there.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>Here's the problem. The mainstream scientific community <i>does</i> share the view that natural selection removes information - this is how it can "select" more promising characteristics. The scientific community holds that gene dupl. and polyploidy provide new information that natural selection "chooses" by removing other less beneficial genes. For example, if a creature with nonretractable claws had a mutation that created a retraction mechanism, the population without the mutation would be slowly removed until only the "retraction" mutation survived. Answers in Genesis denies that such positive-change mutations actually take place.</p>
<p>So, I propose the following changes:</p>

<dd>This is a creationist straw man argument and your challenge is meant to draw me into a debate which is beyond the scope of this talkpage. The idea of information being removed or gained is a creationist artiface set-up to discuss the creationist ill-conceived "information science" idealization of how natural processes are "fallen" and "degenerative". However, the scientific mainstream does not make any statements regarding information and natural selection, so to say otherwise is highly misleading. The onus is on you to show that there are statements in standard scientific texts or papers that indicate that mainstream scientists agree with your characterization. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 03:37, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> wrote an excellent edit that fixed the problems with the paragraph. However, I would thank ScienceApologist to observe <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and not allege that I am trying to "draw [you] into a debate". Do not be so quick to label others, SA.</dd>
<dd>My proposed statements were paraphrased from the stable <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_selection.html" title="Natural selection">natural selection</a> article, SA. According to that article, natural selection is the process by which more favorable <i>genetic</i> traits are passed on (i.e., the less favorable ones are removed). Thankfully, David's edit made such a clarification pretty much unnecessary. I do not intend to draw you into a debate nor was I making unsourced statements; if anything the statement that "this view is not shared by..." was entirely unsourced - the whole problem was that the immediate reference to mutations made it unclear exactly what view was not shared.</dd>
<dd>It is true that natural selection's relative lack of power regarding the introduction of new genetic traits can be used as a straw man argument - mainstream science banks not on natural selection but on mutations for the introduction of new genetic traits. But if you had taken the time to examine closely what I said, you would see that I was not attacking your sacred theory (not that it's your theory, just that it's sacred to you) - just making a distinction for the benefit of the reader. Some editors are so quick to throw AGF out the window whenever a sincere creationist editor mentions evolution or natural selection.</dd>

<dd>Natural selection removing information is a misconception of the process as a whole. The two sentences you had written were factually wrong. For example, a simple scenario might be after a gene duplication one gene maintains its historical function (such as <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photolyase.html" title="Photolyase">photolyase</a> that repairs DNA in response to UV light) the second reversion is mutated to aquire a new function (second photolyase gene loses its lyase activity but aquires a new function as a blue light receptor <a href="../../../c/r/y/Cryptochrome.html" title="Cryptochrome">cryptochrome</a>). So, natural selection has favoured organisms with both genes. Nothing is lost, a new function is acquired. This is the very thing that AiG says cannot happen. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 04:32, 22 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In the example you gave above, AiG would say that the genetic code that lacked the new gene would be selected out. AiG would say that the aquisition of the new blue light receptor function would be impossible. It's really based on your way of looking at things (whether organisms with new genetic traits are "selected" or organisms without the traits are "removed") but the current version resolves the conflict beautifully. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStandonbible_6239.html" title="User:Standonbible">standonbible</a><sup><a href="../../../s/t/a/User_talk%7EStandonbible_b4fb.html" title="User talk:Standonbible">Talk!</a></sup> 04:51, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Natural selection neither increases nor removes "information" - from an information theory perspective it reduces uncertainty (by favouring one genotype over others) and thus <i>increases</i> information. Another way of looking at it is that natural selection improves fit between phenotype and environment, thus it reduces noise, strengthens signal - and thus, increases information. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 04:36, 22 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You can say that. Or you can say that natural selection, by favoring one genotye over another, decreases information by removing defective or lacking genetic codes from the population gene pool. It's two ways of saying the same thing. Natural selection is the process by which positive genotype proliferate throughout a <i>population</i> (increase) - organisms without the genotype are less likely to pass on their genes and thus the complete genetic codes that lack new traits are removed <i>from the population</i> (decrease). <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStandonbible_6239.html" title="User:Standonbible">standonbible</a><sup><a href="../../../s/t/a/User_talk%7EStandonbible_b4fb.html" title="User talk:Standonbible">Talk!</a></sup> 04:51, 22 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>"You can say that" - no, you "said that". You were talking about information. Now if you are talking about genetic diversity, that's a different matter. But it still isn't correct to say that natural selection "reduces genetic diversity". It <i>can</i> reduce it, or it can increase it. It's wrong to say that "[n]<i>atural selection is the process by which positive genotype proliferate throughout a</i> population <i>(increase)</i>". Natural selection can act to increase <i>or decrease</i> allele frequencies. There's no assumption that selection will bring a certain genotype to fixation - selection is not a single-axis function, it acts in multi-dimensional space. Natural selection does not move towards any single optimum, but rather, towards local optima. Natural selection can increase the frequency of a rare allele, making it less likely to go extinct. That would <i>increase</i> the genetic diversity of a population. In addition, certain genotypes may only be favoured when they are rare, while others may be selected against when they are common - for example, if a mutation converts a pseudogene to an expressed product, natural selection can act to increase the frequency of this new allele, incrementing the number of expressed genes in the population. Similarly, if a mutation produces a new allele of an existing gene, natural selection can make the gene more frequent in the population. It is <i>not</i> a given that the new allele would go to fixation in the population - stable polymorphisms are common. So it is possible for natural selection to <i>either</i> increase <i>or</i> decrease the genetic diversity in a population. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 06:03, 22 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think that I'm agreeing with you here. The problem is the way we are referring to natural selection - it is not a force as much as it is the term we use to describe what happens through survival of the fittest. Natural selection cannot add alleles, but it can increase the frequency of a new allele. The point that I was trying to make from the beginning is that natural selection, by itself, has no way to create new genotypes. Like you said, it moves toward a local optima - it <i>might</i>increase the <b>frequency</b> of a rare allele, or it <i>might</i> decrease the <b>frequency</b> of a different allele. Natural selection is the proliferation or non-proliferation of alleles in a dynamic population.</dd>
<dd>The only real change in genetic information that takes place is when a genotype is selected against until it no longer exists - for instance a mutation that provided a new function but left the organism open to bacterial infection. In such cases natural selection <b>removes</b> genetic information from the population. However, it can't actually <b>gain</b> information unless it has new alleles to work with. That was the point I was trying to make - hence "AiG says natural selection only removes information; this is true but mainstream science points to mutations that allow natural selection to add information to a population". The difference is whether we are talking about specific genotypes or overall genetic diversity or the proliferation of a genotype. If we are talking about specific genotypes - natural selection can spread them around through a population but it cannot add new ones. It can only, in some cases, remove old or defective ones. We are saying the same thing two different ways. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStandonbible_6239.html" title="User:Standonbible">standonbible</a><sup><a href="../../../s/t/a/User_talk%7EStandonbible_b4fb.html" title="User talk:Standonbible">Talk!</a></sup> 12:53, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article is not NPOV - it's pro AIG, and except for the criticism, reads like an ad. I'm just STARTING to research the claims, and the FIRST one I looked for - that 'AIG does not endorse teaching creationism in schools' is contradicted by their own website <i>"Ideally, each view [creationism &amp; evolution] should be accurately and appropriately presented, and other theories such as exobiology theory should at least be discussed."</i> Troubling, very troubling. <a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/tj/v13/i2/teaching.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.answersingenesis.org/tj/v13/i2/teaching.asp" rel="nofollow">teaching link</a> - <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairness_And_Accuracy_For_All_6573.html" title="User:Fairness And Accuracy For All">Fairness And Accuracy For All</a> 22:37, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That article is from 1999, they do not currently endorse teaching creationism - and anyway, you will note that they were talking about "denominational colleges" (with a Methodist example) in that paragraph. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossnixon_c5b8.html" title="User:Rossnixon"><sup><font color="green"><i>ross</i></font></sup></a><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossnixon_14dc.html" title="User talk:Rossnixon"><sup><font color="blue"><i>nixon</i></font></sup></a> 00:58, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>They have it on their website, they don't indicate anywhere on that page that the document in question is historical. This doesn't seem to be a complicated situation.

<p>The addition of a totally disputed tag seems a lot like overkill. Can I remove it? Or is there actually something disputable in this article. Whomever added the tag needs to outline their case. Nothing discussed above warrants this tag. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 18:32, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>This article is definitely non-neutral. It does not clarify "evolution is not just a chance , according to the scientific community, but is about natural selection", and "evolution is not about formation of first life" the sentence about "scientists accept that they dont completely understand... " is out of place without mentioning this. These things have to be clarified before this article can be declared non-neutral.--Amit524 06:02, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well let's stick a NPOV tag on totally disputed seems a little OTT. Can you suggest how you would clarify "evolution is not just chance....natural selection". Doesn't the mention of natural selection clarify it? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 06:08, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>While I think most of the article is very NPOV, considering the topic , the last section (Spontaneous generation...) smacks of POV Original Research. We must remember, this article is about AiG, not creation vs evolution in general. The article should also not seek to analyse the validity of there claims, rather, just report them and report specific criticisms of their claims. I see that a number of general criticisms of creationism, not specifically targeted at AiG have snuck in. These need to be removed. A reader can go to the creationism article of a detailed criticism of the topic in general. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshmoo_727a.html" title="User:Ashmoo">Ashmoo</a> 06:10, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just a note about a removed recent edit; in this sentence in the criticism section: "AIG points out that the majority can be wrong; for example, the scientific consensus at one time held geocentric views, and yet those scientists were wrong", an anon editor had added "(ironically biblically based)" into it. That's a common misconception, and in any case was not sourced. The sentence itself <i>was</i> sourced, and the source did not claim that geocentrism was biblical--in fact it debunks that misconception, saying that it was something added to the <s>Bible</s> Church Tradition from "pagan" philosophy, namely Aristotle and Ptolemy. So, just pointing out that I see no reason that parenthetical statement should be there. Now, my understanding is that if there <i>was</i> an actual source for the misconception, that could be included (probably as a seperate sentence for clarity), and cited. It seems pointless though given that the original source debunks it, so I've removed the three words.

<dd>Doesn't appear to warrant discussion. By "added to the Bible", I assume you mean "added to Church tradition"?
