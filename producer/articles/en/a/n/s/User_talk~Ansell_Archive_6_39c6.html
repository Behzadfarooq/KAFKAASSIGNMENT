<h2><span class="mw-headline">Honour or Honor</span></h2>
<p>You ask who keeps changing it...I confess, last time it was me. I won't change it this time but its a quote and as such should stay the same as the original quote which included "honor". Anyway, thanks for fixing the ref tags for me...I have no idea how that slipped by.<small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../i/_/a/User%7EI_already_forgot_0fa6.html" title="User:I already forgot">I already forgot</a> (<a href="../../../i/_/a/User_talk%7EI_already_forgot_7bff.html" title="User talk:I already forgot">talk</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_I_already_forgot_5760.html" title="Special:Contributions/I already forgot">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>I figured out the problem. Originally someone made the change from honour to honor so I looked up the related ref (to discovery) to see how it was spelled in the quote before changing it back. Sure enough, it was spelled honor. Then it was changed back to honour a few hours later so I checked the ref again to see if it was changed. The reference looked the same but the quote from the article was missing. Almost as if discovery no longer wished to mention the "Crikey Fund" in the article anymore so I added a new ref source (abc). I glanced over the article and didnâ€™t pay attention to the honour in the new source. Long story ending, I have now added the original press release as a source and copied the quote verbatim.--<a href="../../../i/_/a/User%7EI_already_forgot_0fa6.html" title="User:I already forgot">I already forgot</a> 08:10, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wow... such a complex story for a single word in effect. I just looked at the ref, saw it was australian and didn't think to go find the original press release. BTW, if Discovery channel removed the statement you probably should remove the sentence next time as it is possibly not true if they think it necessary to edit their press release.

<dd>"BTW, if Discovery channel removed the statement..." Thatâ€™s a tough call. Someone gives a press release then retracts a portion of it by removing it from a web page without notice while other news outlets still cite the original communiquÃ©? Thatâ€™s a tough revert.&#160;:)--<a href="../../../i/_/a/User%7EI_already_forgot_0fa6.html" title="User:I already forgot">I already forgot</a> 08:42, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hey, sorry, I meant to say "think about removing the statement". As you say it is a tough call, since it is completely verifiable if multiple other news agencies cite the original. However, with my ethical convictions I would possibly remove it myself as I would have a specific doubt about the statement in that scenario. Maybe I would not be successful as a journalist, but thats my fate... im not one!&#160;:) <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 08:47, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Regarding anacronyms and piping</span></h2>
<p>Regarding the discussion on PMA's talk page. I agree that Piping links in the general article should not be done. But then, I personally have piped links to US and Australian states, for example at <a href="../../../c/a/s/Caspar_Weinberger_d38b.html" title="Caspar Weinberger">Caspar Weinberger</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bert_Newton_1d03.html" title="Bert Newton">Bert Newton</a>. But only in infoboxes! I think that infoboxes - due to their nature (documenting fast, easily digestible info) might be a special case. I think this warrants a policy discussion somewhere like <a href="../../../p/i/p/Wikipedia_talk%7EPiped_link_49c7.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Piped link">Wikipedia talk:Piped link</a> (as I said on PMA's talk page). What do you think on this specific proposal?

You violate every rules, work with each other to make stupid points, block people, and ABUSE YOUR LIMITTED POWER. Give the lowest man a minimum of authorirty and the first thing that comes to his mind is to abuse. That's you and your friends. You have blocked a friend of mine accusing him of impersonating me, while all of you have been playing "hidden sockpuppetry" all along. Evading the 3RR by rv-ing each at a time. For what? I know your kinds, virtually active but social rejects. But I am too good for your Wikipedia, I was hoping to contribute but not anymore. I have managed to remove my pictures from the files and I will never share my knowledge with those who do not deserve it.<small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 220.73.24.25 (talk â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_220.73.24.25_489b.html" title="Special:Contributions/220.73.24.25">contribs</a>) .</small></dd>

<dd>Even during your block, unless you vandalise your own talk page, you can still contribute to discussion there. In regards to your edits on <a href="../../../m/e/l/Mellat_Park_b44c.html" title="Mellat Park">Mellat Park</a>, it is not like the entire Wikipedia is ganging up on you. We have repeatedly put forward policies which the community has agreed to, as reasons for removing the sentence that you desire to be in the article. I understand that the "honour" of your people is at stake because people are not caring for their national treasure (ie, the locomotive), however, unless you can present the evidence as <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral commentary</a>, and prove that it is not <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> on your part, you are not going to gain the sympathy of the community.</dd>
<dd>In regards to your clain that I have been disregarding 3RR, the purpose of that policy is to avoid edit warring. One exception on the 3RR page to the strict rule is <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html#Reverting_without_edit_warring" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR#Reverting_without_edit_warring</a>, which refers to constructive edits. My first edit to the page was to remove sentence that you and Jeff3000 were actually edit-warring about. That was not to endorse either of your views, the sentence was, and is still, clearly in disregard for the Original research policy. Unless you can rebutt that claim, my edits were constructive and aimed at stopping your edit war.</dd>
<dd>Also, you may have noticed that you were not initially banned indefinitely, this was because we do actually want constructive editors to continue with the project. If you had served your community block, and come back with a civil attitude and not made personal attacks or threats you would have been welcomed back.</dd>
<dd>In terms of your friends edits, he had already been warned for edit warring, so he clearly knew what he did was edit warring, and he had no basis for his edits except to state that he was infact doing Original research by claiming it was "from visula(sic) observation", and hence it could disregard the community consensus on including verifiable, and sourced material. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 00:06, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

You no like our edit, we ban; You no like us, we ban; you talk, we ban; we attack, but we ban before you defend; you break rule, we ban; we break the rule it's ok...in a REAL civilized world, that's called double-standard. LEARN IT. You speak of "my people"? that's right, because it is about our people and your people. Just read the news, Freedome of speech is great only if it is practiced by your people right? If my people talk, BAN!</dd>
<dd>You phrased it so well, "gangin-up", it is ganging-up and your guilty conscience is surfacing. The problem started with Jeff3000, in my opinion, he is a social-outcast. He might even suffer from serious mental problem, I have gone through his "editting" and he seems to be having problems with almost EVERYONE he comes accross. He even delete from his discussion people who criticize hime. He wants to have his way and all of you blindly joined him, without even trying to understand what was going on. I read the Wikipedia's rule, it calls for discussion, not giving/receiving orders. I didn't feel anyone was discussing, but all were giving me orders. Then BAN!</dd>
<dd>Listen, there's an old expression that says: "The smaller the dog, the louder it barks", you people are small, no other world than this creepy Wikipedia to find some kind of (virtual-)social acceptance. So when you come accross others, you bark, and you bark so loud so maybe you can be get the attention you never had...Sorry, I really had good opinion about Wikipedia.</dd>

<dd>Then go back and check for yourself. The whole purpouse of Wikipedia is to let people enter their knowledge to make a popular source of information. A large part of the information available here are without sources and references. That is why this is a non-official site. Jeff3000 and all you barking "wikipedians" had nothing against the sentence written there initially. Jeff3000, the mentally-ill barking loser wanted to have its way with a link. His ignorance and stupidity led him to think that Iranian people mentioned in the article were the ETHNICAL IRANIAN GROUP. He gives the Balkan and China as an expamle. It leads you to think that he's a real stupid, but is he? When you say American, do you mean an ethnical people, or the citizen of the USA? So he kept changing the link from Iranian people back to Iran to reflect his selfish opinion. Then more and more of you barking lil' doggy keep joining him in his bias fight. Until the combined idiocy kicked in and someone had the genius idea to ask for a reference. Although I had clearly uploaded a picture showing the tags, vandalism, and rusts, your desperate moves was to look for reference and consequently removed the whole sentence. Only an idiot (no offense to you and your so-called circle of friends) would be incapable after looking at the picutre not to come up with the same conclusion. So I managed to remove my picture (and all the others as well) because Ø®Ù„Ø§ÛŒÙ‚ Ù‡Ø± Ø¬Ù‡ Ù„Ø§ÛŒÙ‚. Now, once again you try to justify your imature bahaviors by twisting my words and actions. If Wikipedia was not filled with stupid immature, social-rejects barking lil dogs, maybe I could have found someone with the minimum of intelligence and rational to explain my point. The only one who came close to understand it was Wafulz, and although he is one of you, but apparently not part of your gang, you skipped his comments as well. You missed the whole point, but it's ok, because the Chinese have a saying: "When a finger points at the moon, the idiot is the one looking at the finger".</dd>

Nor is it likely that a reader interested in the Saturday vs Sunday Sabbath controversy will need to have Saturday or Sunday explained to them in a linked article. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColonies_Chris_c27e.html" title="User:Colonies Chris">Colonies Chris</a> 09:50, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As you say, it is a question of judgment. However, unwikilinking every "common word" will not really be that well taken, especially by people who see linking such as you refer to, to be what wikis are about, connecting human knowledge together semantically. BTW, the specific example you refer to is a direct claim about a particular non-geographically located subject. The fact that the church is a physical entity and not an intangible economic theory nullifies that example. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 10:26, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have no quarrel with the idea of connecting knowledge. The majority of what I do on WP is making links, not breaking them. However, links have to be tailored to the likely readership of the article. Otherwise we'd be linking every word. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColonies_Chris_c27e.html" title="User:Colonies Chris">Colonies Chris</a> 10:58, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How did I edit the Esperanza page? I don't really know. I thought I was editing your talk page but when I saved, I was redirected to Esperanza, and there was no trace of my comments. So I went and looked your ID up in the page history and edited again using that address.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Review page</span></h2>
<p>In what cases should review pages be used, and when shouldn't they be used?</p>
<p>If notability is discarded as a guideline, then wouldn't that encourage nominators to prove that the article is advertising, which would be even more of a well-poisoner? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndjam_08d6.html" title="User:Andjam">Andjam</a> 04:16, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Maybe it would be appropriate to double post on review pages. Just the fact that I don't look there as I archived the review back in May i think and only noticed it on my watchlist would say the review page is a little out of date. Reviews are not meant to be permanent black list records, they are meant to help.</dd>
<dd>On your other point, encouraging nominators to prove this is advertising, and not actually something that can have the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">vanity</a> element removed, as happens regularly on pages, would simply be a nominator trying to find another way to express their personal opinion. If the page is advertising, <i>and</i> infact it cannot satisfy actual policies, such as <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, then why all the talk about cruft? Why the talk about notability instead of actual things that we can objectively state? How you would prove this is advertising given the independent comments on it is beyond me btw.</dd>
<dd>Admittedly there are a few objective comments on the discussion but most of them look suspiciously like people taking the content material and voting on it based on their prejudice.</dd>
<dd>I did not want to make the comment I did sound like bad faith. I simply wanted to encourage the notion that each person should objectively look at the page and its references and come up with their own piece of the discussion instead of "non-notable" or "per nom." In some discussions that are not this controversial, (the original nomination wasn't controversial at all I guess, but that was in the keep direction) it <i>may</i> be appropriate to simply reference an objective set of conditions that were violated, ie, not a set of acronyms, but rather a set of points based on the article failing a specific part of a policy. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 04:28, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>I've had intermitten net access for a while and haven't been able to keep track of whether the vandal who was attacking this page and others is still around. I noticed you dealt with an alert about him on my talk page (thanks for that), so I'm hoping you're more up to speed. Is he still vandalising? I ask mainly because <a href="../../../m/e/l/Mellat_Park_b44c.html" title="Mellat Park">Mellat Park</a> has been semi-protected for quite a while now and I'd like to unprotect it. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 17:50, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have not noticed them vandalising. Apparently the Tor IP's that they were using were blocked as <a href="../../../o/p/_/WP%7EOP_2cfb.html" title="WP:OP">Open proxies</a> sometime in the last day or two, and they had not had any activity recently. I think it would be safe to unprotect the page. however, it will still be on my watchlist for consideration in the small amount of time I have to devote to wikipedia this month. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 21:43, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
