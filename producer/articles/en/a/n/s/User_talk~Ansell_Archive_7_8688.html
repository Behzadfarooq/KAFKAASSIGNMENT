<p>I guess that there are plenty of student newspapers with wikipedia articles.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Student_newspapers_published_in_the_United_States" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Student_newspapers_published_in_the_United_States" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> I figured that Walla Walla College is pretty small and that the information about its newspaper would get better visibility on the Walla Walla College page.

<p>Adding proposed makes it read strangely, that's all, and I'm trying to present something that's clearly and succinctly written. The proposal should be presented as it's intended to go on the page; with the wording that's intended for the page. There's a prominent tag saying it's just a proposal, and a lot of discussion will be needed before it ever goes live (and it's a huge assumption that it might ever go live), because it's proposing to replace two key policies. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 07:40, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Be bold in contributions, but not in destructions. Editing is a collaborative effort, so <b>editing boldly</b> should not be confused with <b>reverting boldly</b>. This only leads to edit wars. Use the talk page instead. Reverting isn't always collaborative editing, but often a cheap shortcut. Be careful if a revert touches off a revert war. If a revert war begins, then collaboration is not working, and editing the article boldly by reverting is not collaboration. Instead it attempts to force one editor's will on the other editors, which will never work. Such edits will not survive. The "correctness" or "truthfulness" of the edit is irrelevant at this point (<b>See:</b> <a href="../../../b/o/l/Wikipedia%7EBOLD%2C_revert%2C_discuss_cycle_e770.html" title="Wikipedia:BOLD, revert, discuss cycle">BOLD, revert, discuss cycle</a>). --<a href="../../../e/2E/s/User%7EE.Shubee_3be1.html" title="User:E.Shubee">E.Shubee</a> 03:22, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

People are matched with experienced users who are willing to offer coaching. The program is designed for people who have figured out the basics of editing articles; they're not newcomers any more, but they might want some help in learning new roles. In this way, Esperanza would help keep hope alive for Wikipedia because we would always be grooming the next generation of admins.</p>

<dd>There is a difference between feeling that, and edit warring repeatedly using statements to the effect of "this user edits in bad faith and is a vandal". I am going to stay out of the specifics of the situation in question but it would be prudent to let the situation settle down a bit and discuss the edit in detail on the talk page.

<dd>Not sure there what to do as far as attempting to reconcile his edits with what the community expects. Assuming for the moment that he is a sock of Perspicacious, which isn't really in serious question, the checkuser was just unable to conclusively verify it, then his history amounts to contributing just to a small selection of pages, with a variety of edits mostly integrating original research from what he has admitted is his personal website.

<dd>Thanks for your understanding. The last time I looked into it, admittedly a few months ago, the main uses of the "...our..." variant were in sources before about 1800, and in Wikipedia. If we are to be taken seriously as a resource, I think we need to use standard spelling. I think this is a case ("honourary" is similar) where well-meaning editors have <b>assumed</b> that a UK/US spelling difference exists where none actually does, obviously along the lines of humor/humour, honor/honour etc. I quite agree that dictionary.com is not a good source for spelling info. My original discussion had input from UK, US and Australian users checking reputable paper dictionaries, and as far as I can remember nobody was able to point to an instance of "humourous" in a modern printed source. I really do appreciate that you (like me) care enough about spelling to query this. The last time the discussion took place was at <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cane_Toad_c870.html" title="Cane Toad">Cane Toad</a>; I am sure I can dig out further examples of discussion if you like. The main point is that on each occasion the matter has been discussed, nobody has been able to present evidence that it is a matter of national varieties of English, a matter on which I am very sensitive myself and so fully appreciate the sensitivities of others. Best wishes, and thanks again for your interest. --<a href="../../../s/p/e/User%7ESpellmaster_51e4.html" title="User:Spellmaster">Spellmaster</a> 09:41, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, "honor" is one of those US English variants which still looks "funny" to my eye. However, again, "honorary degree" is correct worldwide; there is no substantive use of "honourary" anywhere, hence the comaprison.

<dd>Yes, I noticed that. Of course, google is an extremely poor source for spelling; I hope we can agree that <b>other than the established cases of differences in spelling between national varieties of English</b>, and on certain well-established instances of spelling variants which are equally acceptable (I remember being surprised to find that "propellor" is considered an acceptable variant of "propeller"), spelling is an issue on which we should be fairly prescriptive and consistent here, and should be guided mainly by paper sources, which tend to be more conservative and hence more reliable. I really appreciate your input, by the way; it is reassuring that others besides me care about such issues. --<a href="../../../s/p/e/User%7ESpellmaster_51e4.html" title="User:Spellmaster">Spellmaster</a> 10:04, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Weetbix history</span></h2>
<p>Hi Ansell,</p>
<p>My name is Jed Walker, my mother is Yvonne (Osborne), daughter of Bennison Osborne who invented Weetbix. I noticed my mother's contribution was removed and I re-added it today (though I still have to check with her on where the factory was. They lived in Stoneham but it is quite possible the factory could have been in Clinton).</p>
<p>I then peeked around some more and found the discussion section with your comments about removing a "large block". I'm guessing that was a reference to the history my mother provided.</p>
<p>I would like to see this history in there. What is needed to ensure that it stays?</p>
<p>Thanks for your time.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Jed S. Walker</p>
