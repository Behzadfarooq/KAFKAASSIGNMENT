<p>Did you get the image by taking a screenshot of a zoomed Flash object on that page? That might be a good thing to explain as it is slightly unusual. If you can do so then I think it should be fine.</p>
<p>Also, could you please make more of an effort to fill in edit summaries? This is considered an important guideline in Wikipedia, as it helps us understand what you are doing more easily.

<p>Hoary is not a nice person I see where he would not let the word AGNES using all caps and it in not the correct form to say Agnes The gallery was always AGNES and now thanks to hoary the gallery is incorrect for the first time in its brief history of 8 years opened 1992 closed 2000 Hoary is hoary now one has to look up Agnes (gallery) instead of the correct AGNES. Good luck though I know how hard it is working with a selfi-mposing person who has no regard for what is correct and what is just plain wrong and wrong headed. Sore hoary. sorry Ansett.

<p>What were you trying to do? I’ve gotten completely lost trying to follow all the redirects now. Did you simply add a disambiguation page? We really didn’t need one. There are only two Domino’s Pizza articles, and they can simply refer to one another with hatnotes. The disambiguation page simply points back to itself. Whatever you were trying to do, I hope you’re not finished yet, because it’s a mess right now.</p>
<p>When everything has settled down, both the main articles should have apostrophes. Whether they're curly or straight, I don’t care. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERob_Kennedy_d47c.html" title="User:Rob Kennedy">Rob Kennedy</a> 05:42, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
