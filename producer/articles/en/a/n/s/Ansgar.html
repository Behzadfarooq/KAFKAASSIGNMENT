<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/s/Ansgar.html" title="Edit section: Life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Life</span></h2>
<p>Ansgar was born in <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amiens.html" title="Amiens">Amiens</a>. After his mother’s early death he was brought up at <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corbie.html" title="Corbie">Corbie</a>, and made rapid progress in the learning of the time. According to the Vita Ansgarii, he learned that his mother was in the company of Saint Mary and the little boy who initially lacked an enlightened spirit quickly became serious about life (<i>Life of Ansgar</i>, 1). This would begin the trend of spiritual visions in Ansgar’s life, which would be considered the main motivation in his life by his pupil and subsequent author of Vita Ansgarii, Rimbert. Ansgar was a product of the phase of Christianization of Saxony begun by Charlemagne and continued by his son and successor, Louis the Pious. When Saxony was no longer the focus, it was <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denmark.html" title="Denmark">Denmark</a> that fell under the far sweeping missionary gaze, with a group of monks sent back to Denmark with the Danish king <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harald_Klak_ecae.html" title="Harald Klak">Harald Klak</a>. Eventually Ansgar returned two years later after educating young boys who had been purchased because Harald has possibly been driven out of his kingdom. In <a href="../../../8/2/2/822.html" title="822">822</a> he was one of a colony sent to found the abbey of <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corvey.html" title="Corvey">Corvey</a> (New Corbie) in <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westphalia.html" title="Westphalia">Westphalia</a>, and became there a teacher and preacher. He had for a period resided with the baptized <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denmark.html" title="Denmark">Danish</a> king <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harald_Klak_ecae.html" title="Harald Klak">Harald Klak</a> and when <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_the_Pious_e7e4.html" title="Louis the Pious">Louis the Pious</a> at <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worms%2C_Germany_b18a.html" title="Worms, Germany">Worms</a> in <a href="../../../8/2/9/829.html" title="829">829</a> was requested by two representatives from <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweden.html" title="Sweden">Sweden</a> and the Swedish king <a href="../../../b/j/%C3%B6/Bj%C3%B6rn_at_Hauge_1c8f.html" title="Björn at Hauge">Björn at Hauge</a>, he appointed Ansgar missionary. The representatives had claimed that the several <a href="../../../s/w/e/Swedes.html" title="Swedes">Swedes</a> were willing to convert to Christendom. Ansgar arrived at <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birka.html" title="Birka">Birka</a> in 829, with his aide friar Witmar, and a small congregation was formed in <a href="../../../8/3/1/831.html" title="831">831</a>, which included the king's own steward Hergeir, as the most prominent member. Ansgar and his companion Witmar proceeded to Birka on Lake <a href="../../../m/%C3%A4/l/M%C3%A4laren.html" title="Mälaren">Mälaren</a>. He remained there for six months, involved in preaching and converting the inhabitants, at which time they returned to Louis and Ansgar was appointed Bishopric of <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamburg.html" title="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> in 831.</p>
<p>Besides a diocese formed from those of <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishopric_of_Bremen_e20f.html" title="Archbishopric of Bremen">Bremen</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verden.html" title="Verden">Verden</a>, the new <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolitan_bishop.html" title="Metropolitan bishop">metropolitan</a> was to have the right to send missions into all the northern lands and to consecrate bishops for them. Ansgar was consecrated in November, <a href="../../../8/3/1/831.html" title="831">831</a>, and, the arrangements having been at once approved by <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregory_IV_0eda.html" title="Gregory IV">Gregory IV</a>, went to Rome to receive the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Pallium.html" title="Pallium">pallium</a> directly at the hands of the pope and to be named legate for the northern lands. This commission had previously been bestowed upon <a href="../../../e/b/b/Ebbo%2C_Archbishop_of_Reims_ed86.html" title="Ebbo, Archbishop of Reims">Ebbo, Archbishop of Reims</a> ; but an amicable agreement was reached by which the jurisdiction was divided, Ebbo retaining Sweden for himself. For a time Ansgar devoted himself to the needs of his own diocese, which was still missionary territory with but a few churches. He founded in Hamburg a monastery and a school; the latter was to serve the Danish mission, but accomplished little. The 830s and 840s were a successful time for Ansgar despite the difficulties in the Empire at this time which involved Ansgar losing Turholt due to the division of Louis’ empire after 840. He was to face difficulties in his career when Hamburg was unexpectedly sacked in 845, effectively reducing the church’s treasures and books to nothing and leaving the entire diocese completely destroyed and deemed unrestoreable. Therefore, Ansgar was given the bishopric in Bremen in 847, but this was inappropriate at Hamburg had been an archbishopric. Thus, Bremen and Hamburg were combined for Ansgar, which caused great consternation and hostility from the bishops of Cologne to whom Bremen had been subject. This issue was not resolved in Ansgar’s favor until 864 by Pope Nicolas I. Through all this political turmoil, Ansgar continued his mission to the northern lands and reviving the mission to Sweden in 850. Times were difficult during the Danish civil war and Ansgar was forced to establish good relations with two kings, Horic the Elder and his son, Horic II. Both were receptive to his mission and collaborated with him until Ansgar’s death in 865 (Wood, 124-125).</p>

<p>After the death of <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_le_Debonnaire_6252.html" title="Louis le Debonnaire">Louis le Debonnaire</a> (840), Ansgar lost the abbey of Turholt, which had been given as an endowment for his work, and in <a href="../../../8/4/5/845.html" title="845">845</a> Hamburg was destroyed by the <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danes.html" title="Danes">Danes</a>, so that he was a bishop without either see or revenue. Many of his helpers deserted him, and his work was in danger of extinction. The new king, <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_the_German_58fd.html" title="Louis the German">Louis the German</a>, came to his aid; after failing to recover Turholt for him, he planned to bestow upon him the vacant diocese of Bremen. There were many canonical and other difficulties in the way; but after prolonged negotiations <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Nicholas_I_22d7.html" title="Pope Nicholas I">Pope Nicholas I</a> approved the union of the two dioceses (864).</p>
<p>From <a href="../../../8/4/8/848.html" title="848">848</a> Ansgar resided in Bremen, and did what he could to revive the Danish mission. When he was established in a position of dignity once more, he succeeded in gaining permission from King Haarik to build a church in <a href="../../../s/l/e/Sleswick.html" title="Sleswick">Sleswick</a>, and secured the recognition of Christianity as a tolerated religion. He did not forget the Swedish mission, and spent two years there in person (848-850), at the critical moment when a pagan reaction was threatened, which he succeeded in averting.</p>

In his own diocese he showed himself a model bishop, forward in all works of charity, and of a prayerful and ascetic life. His humility was most marked; when people attempted to venerate him as a wonder-worker, he reproved them, saying that it would be the greatest of miracles if God should deign to make him a really devout man. He was canonized by Nicholas I not long after his death. A collection of brief prayers from his hand is extant with the title Pigmenta (ed. J. M. Lappenberg, Hamburg, 1844).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/s/Ansgar.html" title="Edit section: Ansgar’s Visions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ansgar’s Visions</span></h2>
<p>Although a historical document and primary source written by a man whose existence can be proven historically, the Vita Ansgarii (The Life of Saint Ansgar) can be considered a biased source by historians today. The Vita Ansgarii is concerned, in part, with Ansgar’s visions that supposedly (according to Rimbert, the author) contributed to his incredible missionary feats and provided the necessary encouragement for them. Through the course of this work, there are many important junctures in his life that are embarked on after a vision has occurred to Ansgar. His early studies were inspired by a vision of his mother in the presence of Saint Mary, and Rimbert states that Ansgar’s ensuing devotion to the acetic life of a monk. When the Swedish people were left without a priest for some time, he begs King Horic (of the Swedes) to help him with this problem. After receiving his consent, he consults with Bishop Gautbert to find a suitable man. The two together sought the approval of King Louis, which was granted when he learned that they were in agreement on the issue. Ansgar was convinced he was commanded by heaven to undertake this mission, and he was influenced by a vision he received. In his vision, Ansgar was concerned about the journey. In it, he saw buildings of different kinds and in one of them he met a man who reassured him of his purpose and informed him of a prophet that he would meet, the abbot Adalhard, who would instruct him in what was to happen. In his vision, he searches for and finds Adalhard who commands “Islands, listen to me, pay attention, remotest peoples” which Ansgar interprets as God’s will that he go to the Scandinavian countries as “…most of that country consisted of islands, and also when, ‘I will make you the light of the nations so that my salvation may reach to the ends of the earth,’ was added, since the end of the world in the north was in Swedish territory” (<i>Life of Ansgar</i>, 17-18).</p>
<p>Statues dedicated to him stand in Hamburg and Copenhagen as well as a stone cross at Birka.

<p>Saint Ansgar’s feast day is February 3. He was the Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen and missionary to Denmark and Sweden. He died in 865. This prayer to Saint Ansgar is taken from <i>The Children of the Lord’s Supper</i> and was originally written in Swedish. The prayer itself can be found in Mark Pryce’s <i>Literary Companion to the Festivals: A Poetic Gathering to Accompany Liturgical Celebrations of Commemorations and Festivals</i> printed by Fortress Press in Minnesota, 2003. In this Swedish poem a wise teacher enlightens the faithful who are gathered to hear him and to partake in the Lord’s Supper:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Prayer is Innocence’ friend; and willingly flieth incessant</i></dd>
<dd>‘<i>Twixt the earth and the sky, the carrier-pigeon of heaven.</i></dd>
<dd><i>Son of Eternity, fettered in Time, and an exile, the Spirit</i></dd>
<dd><i>Tugs at his chains evermore, and struggles like flame ever</i>
<dl>
<dd><i>upward.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd><i>Still he recalls with emotion his Father’s manifold mansions,</i></dd>
<dd><i>Thinks of the land of his fathers, where blossomed more</i>
<dl>
<dd><i>freely the flowerets,</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd><i>Shone a more beautiful sun, and he played with the winged angels.</i></dd>
<dd><i>There grows the earth too narrow, too close; and homesick for</i>
<dl>
<dd><i>heaven</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd><i>Longs the wanderer again; and the Spirit’s longings are worship;</i></dd>
<dd><i>Worship is called his most beautiful hour, and its tongue is</i>
<dl>
<dd><i>entreaty.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd><i>Ah! when the infinite burden of life descendeth upon us,</i></dd>
<dd><i>Crushes to earth our hope, and, under the earth, in the graveyard,</i></dd>
<dd><i>Then it is good to pray unto God; for His sorrowing children</i></dd>
