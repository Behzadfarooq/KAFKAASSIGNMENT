<p>Ansell, as one of my Wikifriends I would like to wish you a merry Christmas. I noticed you have chosen to take some time away. Good for you - Wikipedia's interesting but there are other things to life as well. I am now on a break myself. I have appreciated your helpful and mature editing.</p>

<p>Hi Ansell,</p>
<p>This is Jed Walker. I see the note about the information needing verification. My mother pieced this together from her file on her father and weet-bix. What exactly is needed for the verification? I'm having trouble finding my last note to you, I'm not really familiar with wikipedia so please provide any help you can so we can get the verification complete.</p>
<p>Thx</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi, I archived your last query here. The verification would require that a magazine of some sort, or some newspaper clippings were available to double check the data that you have. It is highly likely that newspapers would have the information, however, finding it may require using a library microfiche reader. The reason for not wanting Wikipedia to contain original research is because others do not have direct routes to follow to verify the facts. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 09:15, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Ansell,</p>
<p>I'll check with my mom, I believe she has newspaper references for it, but also a lot of it is probably her own knowledge being the inventor's daughter. I assume if anything doesn't have one it could be placed on the site with reference to her?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia is tough on information that has not been previously published. Feel free to put in the newspaper references but you may need to temporarily prune the parts that you cannot verify with those until you find more references. From looking at the information I doubt that there would be much there that would not be in a newspaper (or company published document) somewhere. There may be a historian for Sanitarium or the Seventh-day Adventist Church that followed the story and wrote it down for posterity. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 22:35, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure I am in the most wikiable state to be able to cope with comments about the article being <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fancruft.html" title="Fancruft">fancruft</a> (see reasons for why I took a break). It is true that you put it up for a Peer Review. Also, the comment about parents and sister. You have 6 sentences, and apparently the world is going to end unless you have 2-3. I don't quite get what some of these comments are worried about. Some of them are minor like the measurements but others just seem to be confusing. "You only have 1 print source." I don't see why an article on a sportsperson needs to have multiple print sources, but thats just my opinion.</dd>
<dd>The comments about weasel words are founded though, and as such they need to be cleaned up/referenced.</dd>
<dd>Not sure whether "Fact check here: "At 1.95 m (6 ft 5 in) and 105 kg (231 lb), he is very large for a swimmer and many thought that as he matured and continued to grow he would be unable to maintain his performance as a teenager." really means that you need two fact checks, or whether they assumed that the physical measurements and the performance were going to have to come from the same fact source (maybe i'm just reading into it).</dd>
<dd>I was under the impression the placement of citations was not a hard and fast requirement. "They [the in-line citations] must go after the period with no space in between. A space must be after the reference and before the start of the next sentence. They also must go after commas."</dd>
<dd>Overall, the FA process seems like you are going to get a grilling not just on the article, but on the personal ideas of the particular reviewers... "To escape the clutches of Tony or Spangineer" and "depends on who you get when it hits FA"</dd>
<dd>I shall have a look at cleaning up the minor corrections but you will have to deal with the "reviewer-specific" complaints yourself&#160;:) <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 07:41, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Ansell,</p>
<p>I'm just letting you know that you accidentally reverted my previous edit when you made a change<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Progressive_Adventists&amp;diff=91133810&amp;oldid=91131242" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Progressive_Adventists&amp;diff=91133810&amp;oldid=91131242" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_Adventists_0d55.html" title="Progressive Adventists">Progressive Adventists</a>. I added it in again. No worries, <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_MacLaurin_a46a.html" title="User:Colin MacLaurin">Colin MacLaurin</a> 18:16, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Ansell,</p>
<p>Sorry for the delay. The scans you asked for are online at these addresses: <a href="http://seventhdayadventism.org/scans/prepared-1.gif" class="external free" title="http://seventhdayadventism.org/scans/prepared-1.gif" rel="nofollow">http://seventhdayadventism.org/scans/prepared-1.gif</a> <a href="http://seventhdayadventism.org/scans/prepared-2.gif" class="external free" title="http://seventhdayadventism.org/scans/prepared-2.gif" rel="nofollow">http://seventhdayadventism.org/scans/prepared-2.gif</a> <a href="http://seventhdayadventism.org/scans/prepared-3.gif" class="external free" title="http://seventhdayadventism.org/scans/prepared-3.gif" rel="nofollow">http://seventhdayadventism.org/scans/prepared-3.gif</a></p>
<p>Feel free to remove this entry after you look at them; if you think the images should be uploaded to Wikipedia, I can do that - they are a little big, and I decided to just show them to you this way first.</p>
