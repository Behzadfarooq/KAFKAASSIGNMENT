<p>Anshe Chung should not get this much space in the Wikipedia, since the name doesn't refer to anything in reality, and is just the name of n avatar in an online game that has a small membership and has only been around a few years</p>
<dl>
<dd>Probably right, for now; particularly due to the lack of sources. Merge into <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Life_f75c.html" title="Second Life">Second Life</a>? <a href="../../../s/j/_/User%7ESj_7824.html" title="User:Sj">+sj</a> <a href="../../../s/j/_/User_talk%7ESj_d037.html" title="User talk:Sj">+</a> 04:18, 18 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Agreed, merge or delete, this feels like a vanity entry created by the company itself, espically with the fierce editwar.
<dl>
<dd>Merge or delete is probably the best option, considering. Doubtful that this entry was created by Linden Lab, more likely by Anshe.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Anshe may be the first or one of the first avatars who financially supports not only her creator but also several employees. That is a remarkable milestone in virtual world history. I also disagree with the statement that there is a lack of sources. Her story has been all over the media, including publications such as Fortune and Business 2.0. She maintains a list on her own site that is quite impressive. I currently can't think of another avatar who achieved similar recognition in the mainstream media. The recent controversy about this article on Wikipedia only adds to the notion that there exists a lot of public interest.</dd>
<dd>I created the article and I'm not Anshe. I created it because Anshe is listed in several other business directories and is generally considered a milestone of virtual business. The fact that it was <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Life_f75c.html" title="Second Life">Second Life</a> in which she did business is less significant than the fact of the business's success, thus I would oppose a merge. Hyphz 14:06, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Opposed to Merge, as well: there is no way the reasons applied to this entry to merge/delete will withstand application to other entries for fictional representations of actual things/people. If the title of a book can have an entry, so can the title of a virtual person. If anything, this deserves its own entry more than mention in the article about SL, except in a general way that would include the less-well-known but comparably large-scale, or only the next level of scale, IMHO. 67.81.50.181 14:12, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/s/Talk%7EAnshe_Chung_473e.html" title="Edit section: Early career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early career</span></h2>
<p>I'd like to ask that Valery42 please refrain from attempting to re-write the paragraph about Anshe's early career in SL. Valery42 claims that "A person's private life and sexual preferences are not appropriate topics for a Wikipedia entry". My response to that is: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_famous_prostitutes" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_famous_prostitutes" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_famous_prostitutes</a> - this is a page about prostitutes and not escorts, but serves to show that private life and sexual preference already exist in other entries.</p>
<p>Some may object to this early career of Anshe's, but it is "verifiable" through a notecard in SL that has Anshe listed as creator and has pictures of her avatar attached to it (Reference Second Life Notecard "Anshe Chung - female escort" Creation date: 2004-04-18 06:58:28). Additionally, there are many individuals who new Anshe in those early days.</p>
<p>None of these may satisfy verifiability, but I think that applies to the entire entry - not just this paragraph.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's one thing to place information about sexual life in an article about famous prostitutes, who are only encyclopedic for their sexual life; I don't think it's really relevant to the current notability of this subject. Also, we are, and justifiably so, more careful about putting in unverified and not-really-relevant information about living people that could be harmful, as opposed to that which isn't harmful. Please do not add it without strong and verifiable justification.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, please note that reverting continuously may get both parties blocked from editing for edit-warring by the "<a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">three-revert rule</a>". If you have disputes about the content, discuss it here, or pursue <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">dispute resolution</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Oh, and FWIW, I support a merge.<a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">Mindspillage</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMindspillage_c644.html" title="User talk:Mindspillage">(spill yours?)</a> 17:42, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The justification for adding that information is that it was those early careers (including, but not limited to, being an escort) that formed the base for her current empire. It provided the contacts and the money to begin a highly successful career as SL's largest land dealer. This entry is basically a bio about Anshe and I think in that context it is relevant.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I have followed the discussions on the closed Second Life forums that preceded the editing war of this page. They led me to the conclusion that we don't face an attempt to provide relevant information, but another outbreak of jealousy by lesser SL business owners who did not get as far as Anshe did. Their objective is to add as much negativity as possible until it either hurts Anshe's reputation or the whole article gets deleted. As far as I know, her early days in Second Life she spent as an entertainer, before she turned to creating content. This included stuff such as event hosting, teaching, art performances and what she calls "private entertainment". Wether any of that was rated mature I don't consider relevant to this article. It wouldn't surprise me in a mature rated virtual world full of porn. In any case, whatever she did at that time she probably did under the assumption of anonymous roleplay in a closed like minded community. This should be considered when editing an information resource that might be accessed by her family and RL neighbours who in addition may not be able to distinguish between the roleplayed avatar and the creator.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I am not a participant in this game and I feel that this persons "early career" consisted of engaging in sexual interaction with individuals in exchange for virtual money. I have no axe to grind and no agenda. It is very interesting and I believe people deserve to know what this "public figure" did during her "second life".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>You anonimus idiots feel good about destroying a public individual's reputation .. I wonder where all your skeletons are hidden .. and not just on-line .. Delete the whole thing .. Real people have families and friends .. thay don't need to be slandered this way.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is not slander if it is true. Imagine all the entries if we were to "sanitize" them so that controversial truths were not included. As far as "Real people have families and friends" - one should have brought that into consideration before entering into that business, not after.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Agreed, yet again. Detailing HOW Anshe made her "rise to the top" of SL is important, if this is to remain a Wiki entry. If Anshe is a celebrity, as was posited in the original delete thread, then she'll have to deal with the negative consequences of her actions and past, a la the Kennedys, Paris Hilton. I myself would rather this whole entry be deleted, and restarted as a entry on the corporation itself, rather than single out one "avatar" as the end-all. It would smack less of vanity that way.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<p>I have protected the page due to the edit war and due to the fact that unsourced derogatory information has been repeatedly added to the article. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">The Uninvited</a> Co., <a href="../../../u/n/i/User_talk%7EUninvitedCompany_4866.html" title="User talk:UninvitedCompany">Inc.</a> 05:06, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think you are allowed to post information, but it has to be sourced to somewhat reputable sources.</p>

Here is another reputable source, posted by Guni Greenstein, the husband of the husband and wife team:</p>
<dl>
<dd>("husband of the husband and wife team": From what I understand, Anshe Chung is the avatar of Ailin Graef and Guni Greenstein is the avatar of her husband Guntram. They both seem to have a share in the business that has been named after the wife's avatar. It also has been reported that they on occasion use each other's accounts to access business assets tied to those accounts. The article as it stands now might not reflect this accurately. Do we have some sources on this matter? Adam999 06:29, 20 February 2006 (UTC))</dd>

<p>At ANSHECHUNG.COM we believe in a Second Life world that is more than an endless random collection of land parcels. We believe in diversity, culture and places worth exploration, while at the same time empowering people to realize their own dreams.</p>
<p>In the new continent of Islandia we are working on a large scale consistent development that will feature different landscapes ranging from very structured areas to wild mountain ranges. As you know we do this within a very tight timeframe and within the constraints of a very competitive land market. However, we are up to the challenge and we are confident that we will be able to provide you an area that will be attractive to both land owners and visitors</p>

Notice the almost deceptive change in posting styles, clearly these people can and are willing to manipulate their online personas.</p>

<dd>That second quote is derived from a joke thread. It is a mockery of numerous conspiracy theories that preceded his post. Sadly, some individuals deliberately and repeatedly have tried to misrepresent it as a serious statement. He is manipulating his online persona as much as a cabaretist who imitates Castro is manipulating his real persona.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Anyways, I hope we don't delete this page. I think pretty much everyone will agree that Anshe is a big part of history of the virtual world, a world that is increasingly becoming more important and more recognized (see above) by mainstream press everyday.</p>
<p><br />
Joke thread? If you find it funny trolling the community (if you read that thread, you'll notice that no one else is sharing in 'the joke'), then yes, I guess it is a joke. However, most respectable business people do not engage in such antics.</p>
<p>Anyways, I am mostly pro-anshe / pro-guni, I am just trying to add some facts to this dialogue.</p>
<p>Adam999 .. it is actually against the SL TOS to share accounts, so officially, I doubt you're going to find a lot of sources for this. However, in order to do anything of use in SL you do need to share accounts from time to time again, so it's pretty probable that they do share accounts. I don't think you actually need to say that they do share accounts, but I think it's worthwhile adding that in order to run a business together you would pretty much have to share accounts.</p>

<p>First of all, Anshe did provide an escort service as part of her <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Life_f75c.html" title="Second Life">Second Life</a> business career, so it is entirely relevant. Secondly, there is not reason not to include information about an individual/corporation if it is factual. Thirdly, this talk section has clearly been edited by a number of people who have not contribued to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> much before. It is appropriate to use the Plus sign at the top of the page, near the <b>edit this page</b> section, to add comments to a discussion page, not to haphazardly edit with no clear way to follow the discussion.<br />

<p>oh ok, well why have an "edit this page" then?</p>

<p>I think you need to reference a credible resource if you wish to say that she was an escort. I think if you dig through the forum archives or new world notes you might find something, however simply saying "this is common knowledge" is rather lazy, wikipedia or not.</p>
<p>I went directly to Anshe and confronted her with the issue. I can only recommend doing the same. She was surprisingly open and easy going about her days as a "private entertainer" and "tea house girl". She seemed to be proud of her roleplaying, even though she said it wasn't in any way relevant to her career or success in Second Life. After listening to her, I believe that using the western terms "prostitute" or "escort" to describe what she did would be misleading, if not insulting. When talking about the actual person behind the computer one could maybe describe it as "interactive storytelling". While refering to the avatar I could imagine the terms "geisha" or indeed "private entertainer" as fitting. Not relevant to the article though. I would still leave it out.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Due to the nature of Second Life, this is both an article on the avatar - the character - and on the business of AnsheChung.com. As part of the biography of the well-known avatar, it certainly should be included: it was how she got her start in the Second Life economy! If a real-life billionaire had made money first as a personal escort, it would be part of the article if it was verifiable. So why should it not be a part of this article? Plus, the money from both that and her content store gave her the capital to begin the real-estate business, so it is directly relevant. I believe the term "escort" would be an appropriate term, and not misleading or insulting: an escort is someone who is paid for their company, whether it is of a sexual nature or not. There are escorts out there who are merely escorts (not prostitutes in hiding) and besides that, there's no reason to think that either term is an insult - especially if both are legal, double especially if both occur in a virtual world. <font size="3"><b><a href="../../../x/i/n/User%7EXinoph_f442.html" title="User:Xinoph">Xinoph</a></b> | <font size="2"><a href="../../../x/i/n/User_talk%7EXinoph_f863.html" title="User talk:Xinoph">TALK</a></font></font> <font size="1">17:54, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</font></dd>

<p>As the original article author I feel I should chip in..</p>
<ul>
<li>I am not Anshe, nor Linden Lab, nor do I work for either of them.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I created the article because Anshe is considered an important indicator of the potential for virtual business and has attracted substantial success as a result. I would oppose a merge with <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Life_f75c.html" title="Second Life">Second Life</a> because Anshe's importance lies in the fact she demonstrated real money could be made for virtual goods, not in the fact she succeeded in a particular world.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Since the page is about the company, not the individual, the comments about having been an escort are not relevant IMHO - she may have been an escort/teacher at one stage, but she wasn't running the company Anshe Chung at that time.</li>

<p>It became obvious That Anshe and her Cohorts were simply using this page as an advertisement for Anshe's Business. It is totally Irrevelent how many areas she owns, Other services where she buys and sells other line currency. This was totally irrevelant. There are also many negative facts that have surfaced that are just as relevant as the positive ones. I recommend that only SYSOPS be allowed to edit this page for the next month or so. This should clear up a lot of things.</p>
<p>EDIT: Normally This Wouldnt bother me but AndreasZander is trying to say I added information to make anshe look bad, In fact I did not add anything, BUT TOOK OUT information that was advertizing and obviously put there for no other reason to advertize or spread gossip. AndreasZander is not a registered user in Second life, It should also be known that although I do participate in SL and have been there a long time. I do NOT use the name Bovar Bellow in second life. It should also be stated that like most of Second Lifes participants, I do not participate(post)in the Second Life forums either. AndreasZander is entitled to his opinions but please dont blame me for posting negative things about Anshe. They were here a long time before I showed up. I would still like to recommend that this page remain SYSOP only edit only, or Merged into the SECOND Life Page.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that I only started editing this page a couple of weeks ago, NOT a couple of months ago. ________________________________________________________________</p>
<p><br />
AndreasZander ______ Bovarbellow is an individual who, since two months, is trying to get this page deleted or turned into something that makes Anshe look bad. This becomes quite obvious to anyone who takes the time to review his edit history on wikipedia. During all this time he has not added any relevant information whatsoever, but numerous insults and unsourced evaluations of her person. I am not Anshe nor a "cohort", but I respect her. I agree with the locking of the entry and hope that now some SYSOPS will perform real research and add sourced and balanced information to the article.</p>
<p>By chance I know who posted the article in the first place. He is a direct competitor of Anshe in the Second Life land market. This once more invalidates Bovarbellow's claims and shows us that somebody is here to throw mud. AndreasZander 08:46, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The passage about so called controversy behaviour was deleted because it contained no evidence at all but at lot of accusations and has to be seen as business-damaging attacks of envious person who try to get into the business themselves. The dubiously value of these accusations is obvious as they use indirect language, mention anonymous business-damaging campaingns in a way the negative touch falls on Anshe's reputation instead of the anonymous attackers and mention ridiculous statements she would not speak English well, just to transport another rumor in the same sentence.</p>

Dear all, Dear editors,</p>
<p>I would like to start a discussion about where the edge is between a fact-telling encyclopedia and a business-damaging rumors campaingn.</p>
<p>Due to my opinion it is necessary to give facts and references when somebody should become accused of something.</p>
<p>Due to my opinion it it not acceptable to e.g. write somebody can 'not speak English' well (what is not of major relevance in this context in an encyclopedia and not well measurable) just to transport some negative unproven rumors in the second part of the sentence.</p>
<p>Best regards, Martin Schaller</p>

<dd>Wikipedia policy states that in cases where the source requires registration, such as the NY Times online used to in order to read the entries, it's perfectly acceptable to post the source in the relevant talk page until it is read by those who request it, and then immediately have it deleted. Furthermore, policy only suggests it's inappropriate to use forums as secondary sources; they are used as primary ones. I don't think it's fair or responsible to discount the forums of a video game when said forums are the news system and main mode of communication. Furthermore, SL's forums are extensively policed by residents and moderators and are as accurate for the medium as anything else. - <a href="../../../m/i/x/User%7EMixvio_ba2d.html" title="User:Mixvio">mixvio</a> 18:27, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Second Life is most certainly a video game and a computer game. One that I've been a participant of for far longer than you possibly could have been, so I understand the nuances and reality of it far more than you possibly could be. The quote attributed to Anshe's husband was attributed to him because it was posted, by him, to the forums. That's a primary source. You're significantly off base, and lofty wordplay doesn't change that. SecondCast is a resident-run program, unaffiliated with both Linden Lab and Second Life itself. - <a href="../../../m/i/x/User%7EMixvio_ba2d.html" title="User:Mixvio">mixvio</a> 21:20, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It has been well established by Linden Lab, and by repeated consensus on the Wikipedia that Second Live is not a game. However the discussion on this topic should be avoided in this thread.</dd>
<dd>The quote, if you actually check the source, was made on a post by <b>Enabran Templar</b>. This, at best, makes it a <b>secondary source</b>. However, I could not find the messages anywhere prior to that post in the thread, and although I did not look in the latter part of the thread due to the tone of the "quote" leading me to believe that it is not an actual quote. Hence it was removed.</dd>
<dd>SecondCast is a resident-run podcast, not program, and <b>is</b> affiliated with Linden Lab, since John Swords assists with the voice-enabled Town Hall meetings.</dd>
<dd>The quote in question is a dubious secondary source made in a tone and using language not associated with any posts made by him in the thread, so I cannot see how you can possibly conceive of that quote as attributable to him.</dd>

<dd>It was the repost by Enabran Templar because yes, you're quite right, the original source doesn't exist anymore. Anshe and her husband have been accused and caught editing past posts to delete incriminating statements. However Enabran is an exceptionally well-established resident in SL with no reputation, at all, for making such a statement up. The quotes aren't taken from that thread specifically, additionally, which is why you can't find them there. Enabran was quoting statements made in another thread that no longer exist (because they were deleted by Guni) to highlight why he didn't feel Anshe Chung Studios was capable of handling the project highlighted in that thread. This is a subject for an alternate discussion, however. As for the tonal quality, both Anshe and Guni switch between perfect English and "I can barely read this, what the hell" frequently. This has been caught and pointed out many times.

<dd>By your own admission, the quote cannot be verified, because the original source does not exist. Using a secondary source that refers to a primary source that does not exist that is held on a forum that requires login doesn't make any logical sense whatsoever, as the source cannot be deemed reliable.</dd>
<dd>You cannot claim that can be used as a reliable source. Your statement <b>"Enabran was quoting statements made in another thread that no longer exist (because they were deleted by Guni)"</b> demonstrates precisely why the SL forums cannot be used for sources. The posts can be edited. And since search engines can't go in and archive the forums, there's no way to go into some archive and get a link to the original post.</dd>
<dd>There is no evidence to support your claim that Enabran's quote was ever made by Guni. While you can claim that Enabran has no reputation for making statements up, you're ignoring <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html#Bulletin_boards.2C_wikis_and_posts_to_Usenet" title="WP:RS">WP:RS#Bulletin boards.2C wikis and posts to Usenet</a> <b>"we have no way of knowing who has written or posted them, and in part because there is no editorial oversight or third-party fact-checking."</b></dd>

The he said, she said stuff will always be an issue, but it probably doesn't belong here in the first place. I won't delete it myself (because I seem to get yelled at when I do&#160;:P ) but that would be my recommendation.

<p>The person who wrote the section on griefing is clearly a hige fan of AC, because the description exaggerates the events (dancing cartoon penises are hardly "sexually explicit"). They only present it from her point of view, and neglect to mention the controversy surrounding the way she bullied news publications into removing the pictures. She claimed the photos and videos were copyright violations, which is untrue and has no grounding in law because as a non-American citizen she is not allowed to file DMCA complaints.

<p>As far as I know, Somethingawful is the news outlet of the grievers who staged the attack. It is probably as neutral a source as an Al Quaida video documenting 9/11.</p>
<p>SomethingAwful is not "the news outlet of the grievers." If you want to use a comparison similar to the one you used, why not try this: Petey using the griefers' video on his website is akin to Al-Jazeera using a video given to them by al-Qaida leaders. He has no personal connection with the griefers and had nothing to do with the attack itself. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabasterchinchilla_4ca3.html" title="User:Alabasterchinchilla">Alabasterchinchilla</a> 17:13, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>In addition, and as I noted in the paragraph starting this section, it has a collection of links to various news sources, including the Sydney-based publication that had a complaint launched against it by Graef.

<p><br />
OK, I'm a noob to the whole wikipedia editing thing, but what ive failed to see on this page and the entry on Chung is any mention of Fair use laws. If images of her avatar are copyrighted, which seems debatable, images of her or the video that was on somethingawful would be protected as a kind of news story, if it wasnt just being used to make fun of her. Even if this was the case, parody is also part of Fair use, as stated in Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_v._Acuff-Rose_Music%2C_Inc" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_v._Acuff-Rose_Music%2C_Inc" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_v._Acuff-Rose_Music%2C_Inc</a>.). There needs to be some mention of this as well as the acusations of bullying and also maybe the supposed deleting of the account of the somethingawful writer by youtube. have a nice day&#160;:) Hbob82 06:56, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think what a lot of people don't realize is that a real photo of Ailin Graef was manipulated to make her holding a real penis and that basically the same people who used that photo filmed the video. Is it fair use when I take a photo of a celebrity, manipulate it to porn, then make a video filming that photo and then distribute it? Have there been known cases of the distribution of fake celebrity porn photos and legal actions resulting from that? Are there known cases where a court ruled in favor of "fair use" in cases of the creation of such pictures? -Val</p>

<p>MrDarcy, this is a dispute that involves journalists. Their articles can not be considered objective sources in this case since they are part of the dispute. My suggestion is to get hold of the sources used by the journalists. Has the communication between Anshe and Guntram and the journalists been published?</p>
<p>There is also no source referenced that prooves that Anshe actually provided sex for money (= prostitution). All we know is that somebody claims to possess a notecard where Anshe called herself "escort" and offers mature services. Stuff like watching a porn movie together, erotic domination or stripping are examples of mature activities that are not prostitution under Calif. State Law.User:AndreasZander: Andreas Zander</p>
<dl>
<dd>Which is why they're called erotic services, instead of prostitution. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 03:53, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That argument makes sence. I think we can agree here. Erotic services or adult entertainment could be stated, prostitution we should avoid unless we find a better source.</dd>

<p>Alright, so we've got that settled. Are there any other issues you have with the prose I wrote?
