<p>According to the 1982 preamble to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</p>
<p><b>Canada was founded on the principles that recognize the supremacy of God and the rule of law</b></p>
<p>The idea seems to be a balance between freedom of religion and the state rights, this was first tested in the guibord case of 1874 where the state used it power to force the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Catholic Church</a> to provide a Joseph Guibord a strong proponent of the church in life,with a Christian burial upon his death sighting that to do otherwise would be to suggest that guibord wasn’t a good man which was not the case.</p>
<p>Section two of this document goes on. Everyone has fundamental freedoms which includes the freedom of conscience and religion “the right to entertain such religious beliefs as a person chooses, the right to declare religious beliefs openly and without fear of hindrance or reprisal, and the right to manifest religious belief by worship and practice or by teaching and dissemination”. <i><a href="../../../r/2E/_/R._v._Big_M_Drug_Mart_fb2d.html" title="R. v. Big M Drug Mart">R. v. Big M Drug Mart</a></i></p>
<p>Since that time the state has always strived to provide complete freedom of religion as long as it does not interfere with the rights of others.</p>
<p>Canadians are therefore free to have their own beliefs and opinions, are free to practice religion or to ignore it, and are free to establish media organizations with or without religious content. Canadian religious institutions generally benefit from <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charitable_organization.html" title="Charitable organization">charitable organization</a> status, which allows supporters to benefit from tax deductions for their financial contributions.</p>
<p>There have however in recant year been serious changes to the Canadian legal system that have been seen by some as an attack on freedom of religious belief.</p>
<p>These are:</p>
<p>The House of Commons and the Senate in May 2004 passing Bill C-250, which added "sexual orientation" to the "hate propaganda" section of the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Criminal_Code_c03a.html" title="Canadian Criminal Code">Canadian Criminal Code</a>, thus making it illegal for people to propagate hate based on sexual orientation. This did not include clergymen however.</p>
<p>And</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Court_of_Canada_1283.html" title="Supreme Court of Canada">Supreme Court of Canada</a> in December 2004 replied to the federal government's draft legislation that would legalize gay marriage nationwide. The Court ruled that the federal government has the exclusive authority to define marriage, that same-sex marriage was constitutional and was far from violating it, in fact "it flowed from" it, and that religious officials can't be forced to perform gay weddings.</p>

<p>Many <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monotheistic.html" title="Monotheistic">monotheistic</a> religions in Canada (<a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>, <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>, and <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>) have sacred texts that have sections that declare sexual relations between people of the same sex as forbidden. For example, the Koran (7:80-81, 26:165) and the Bible (Leviticus 18:22, Romans 1:26-27, I Timothy 1:9-10, etc.) explicitly forbid <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">homosexuality</a>. Conflicting verses do exist and at least one speaks positively about homosexual love (Samuel 1:26).In resent years however the official view on homosexuality has become more tolerant with a clear distinction between members of the religion be they Christian,Jew or Muslim and thoughs outside most treat the physical act as a sin but not the temptation to do so and accept that all people are sinners.These groups council there members to treat thoughs outside there religion with respect in keeping with gods love till they accept gods plan for then no religious group advocates any acts of discrimination. This view however does not extend to same sex marriages which is seen as going against there belief that god plan should include naturally born children. To date there has been no attempt by the government to force religious group to perform same sex marriages.</p>

<p>In reason years the bible itself has been brought under scrutiny with the Hugh Owen case, a Saskatchewan prison guard, who published an advertisement in the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star-Phoenix_6d64.html" title="Star-Phoenix">Star-Phoenix</a>, a newspaper in <a href="../../../s/a/s/Saskatoon%2C_Saskatchewan_cc87.html" title="Saskatoon, Saskatchewan">Saskatoon, Saskatchewan</a>. The ad referenced Bible verses related to homosexuality (without quoting them) and drew a line through an image representing a gay couple. A complaint was lodged with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Board of Inquiry. The Board ruled against Owen and that decision was also upheld by a lower court. For a time, this set the only legal precedent in Canada for parts of the Bible being deemed as <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hate_speech.html" title="Hate speech">hate literature</a>. On 13 April 2006 the <a href="../../../s/a/s/Saskatchewan_Court_of_Appeal_19b3.html" title="Saskatchewan Court of Appeal">Saskatchewan Court of Appeal</a> overturned the previous decisions, but warned that Bible verses could still be deemed as hate literature depending on how they are used.<sup id="_ref-hugh_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hugh" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsolin_Status_of_religious_freedom_in_Canada_fc16.html" title="Edit section: Education and religion">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Education and religion</span></h2>
<p>Canada has an inconsistent approach to <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_education.html" title="Religious education">religious education</a>. <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_School_fc3c.html" title="Catholic School">Catholic education</a> public funding is mandated by various sections of the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution_Act%2C_1867_6da8.html" title="Constitution Act, 1867">Constitution Act, 1867</a> and reaffirmed by <a href="../../../s/e/c/Section_Twenty-nine_of_the_Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms_d9c4.html" title="Section Twenty-nine of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms">Section Twenty-nine of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a>. More recently however, with a growing level of <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multiculturalism.html" title="Multiculturalism">multiculturalism</a>, particularly in <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario.html" title="Ontario">Ontario</a>, debate has emerged as to whether publicly funded religious education for one group is permissible. <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newfoundland.html" title="Newfoundland">Newfoundland</a> for example, withdrew Catholic funding in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>. <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebec.html" title="Quebec">Quebec</a> abolished religious education funded by the state through the Education Act, 1998 which took effect on July 1st of that same year.</p>
<p>Canadian public school systems are under pressure to promote LGBT-rights or sex education topics. The trend started in 2002, when the Supreme Court ruled that <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrey%2C_British_Columbia_8970.html" title="Surrey, British Columbia">Surrey, British Columbia</a> schools can not select library books that exclude LGBT-related publications.<sup id="_ref-gm3_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gm3" title="">[2]</a></sup> It has now evolved into a full scale re-write of curriculums. The most visible example of this is the BC Government appointment of <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_and_Murray_Corren_e558.html" title="Peter and Murray Corren">Peter and Murray Corren</a>, a gay advocacy couple, to edit public school cirruculums. The Correns had previously filed a complaint with the BC Human Rights Tribunal alleging that the omission of LGBT-related topics in school curriculums is a form of discrimination. Rather than fight the case, the Government of BC quietly signed a six-page "legally binding" contract in April 2006 transferring an undisclosed amount of control to the Correns to amend the K-12 curriculums relating to sexual orientation issues. There was no public debate on the appointment of the advocacy couple to amend the curriculums. Partial details of the contract were disclosed by newspapers a couple of months after the appointment. The couple has told newspapers that they also intend to limit the ability of parents to have their children "opt-out" of learning about "healthy lifestyles" and "healthy relationships". It is not clear what impact this might have on faith-based schools, which are required by law to teach the same curriculum as public schools.<sup id="_ref-cohen_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cohen" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Similarly, in many cases it is no longer possible for parents to have their children "opt-out" of sex education. Cheryl Howard, of <a href="../../../c/o/u/Courtenay%2C_British_Columbia_17ca.html" title="Courtenay, British Columbia">Courtenay, British Columbia</a>, was informed that her home-schooled children would not graduate unless they were taught a <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_education.html" title="Sex education">sex education</a> course. She filed a complaint with the BC Human Rights Tribunal, which was denied.</p>
<p>In some cases, religious schools have been unable in enforce their moral codes. In 2002, Monsignor John Pereyma Catholic High School in <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitby%2C_Ontario_07df.html" title="Whitby, Ontario">Whitby, Ontario</a> lost a court battle to enforce its <a href="../../../c/o/d/Code_of_conduct.html" title="Code of conduct">code of conduct</a>, when they sought to prevent student <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marc_Hall_ac96.html" title="Marc Hall">Marc Hall</a> from bringing a gay date to the school prom.<sup id="_ref-gm_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gm" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>Some comments from government officials regarding religion have concerned some religious believers.</p>
<ul>
<li>During the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_federal_election%2C_2000.html" title="Canadian federal election, 2000">Canadian federal election, 2000</a>, Liberal <a href="../../../h/e/d/Hedy_Fry_9b16.html" title="Hedy Fry">Hedy Fry</a>, then current Member of Parliament for <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver_Centre_b3c9.html" title="Vancouver Centre">Vancouver Centre</a>, said <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stockwell_Day_a746.html" title="Stockwell Day">Stockwell Day</a> will "abuse his political power by making all Canadians believe, as he said, that Jesus Christ is the God of the whole universe ...

Fry's remarks were viewed as <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Christian_prejudice_87a1.html" title="Anti-Christian prejudice">anti-Christian</a> by the some in the Christian community while spokepersons from some non-Christian religious groups rejected Fry's comments.<sup id="_ref-sackfry_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sackfry" title="">[5]</a></sup></li>
<li>In 2004, Liberal <a href="../../../s/e/n/Senator.html" title="Senator">Senator</a> <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laurier_LaPierre_d40d.html" title="Laurier LaPierre">Laurier LaPierre</a> responded in an e-mail to a Christian regarding the then proposed hate crime <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_C-250_0ff2.html" title="Bill C-250">Bill C-250</a>, with various comments, including the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deathwish.html" title="Deathwish">deathwish</a> "God! you people are sick.

<li>Some practices of very small religious minorities have always been restricted. For example, <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamous marriages</a> have always been illegal in Canada, regardless of religious beliefs. This limitation applies to a very small minority of religious believers in Canada who endorse the practice. Mainstream religious leaders support the ongoing criminalization of polygamy as their moral beliefs are opposed to those of the smaller religious minority. Authorities do not strictly enforce the applicable laws, as has often been the case in <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bountiful%2C_British_Columbia_9e42.html" title="Bountiful, British Columbia">Bountiful, British Columbia</a>.
