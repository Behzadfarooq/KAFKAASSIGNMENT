<p>Set up in 1959, the University has inherited the two outstanding medical traditions in Anhui Province. One is from the southern part of Anhui, which is called Xin’an; The other one is from the northern part which is called Huatuo. Through 46 years of development since its founding, the University has grown into a mature higher education institution which not only offers undergraduate and graduate education but also offers continuing and international education. At present it has created thousands of advanced medical talents, who have spread over all the China and the world, who function as the cornerstone in the everyday practice, anagement and academic study in their respective fields.</p>
<p>With the coming of worldwide trends to studying Chinese medicine, Chinese pharmacy, Acupuncture and Moxibustion, the University’s external exchanges and cooperation are booming. In recent years, the University has signed scores of cooperative agreements with overseas higher education institutions including a cooperation agreement with Canadian Institute of Postgraduate Studies (Canada) and a student exchange agreement with Hanseo University (Korea). Other foreign partners include Hong Kong University, University of East-West Medicine (California, USA), The Medical School of Columbia University (USA), New York Traditional Chinese Medicine Research Institute (USA), Jamaican Cultural Center of Chinese Medicine (Jamaica), Sydney University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Australia), International University of Traditional Chinese Medicine of Vancouver (Canada), Omega Institute of International Studies (Nepal) and etc. Since 1996, when the University was authorized to enroll international students, and 1997, when to enroll the students from the districts of Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, there have been hundreds of overseas students from dozens of countries and regions having studied at our University. In 2004, six Singaporean students at our University successfully passed their thesis defense for a Master’s degree and obtained it. At present, nearly a hundred international students and those from the districts of Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan are pursuing their Bachelor’s or Master’s Degree here. There are also many international students coming for their clinical observations and internships each year. Through ten years’ practice of international cooperation and education, the University has accumulated abundant experience in international exchanges and education. Gradually a competitive faculty, which is professional in educating international students, has formed. The University also created a sound campus service system and a high-efficient school administration for the students. As a result, more and more international students and visitors are attracted to come here from the entire world. The University has become an important base for the international exchanges and education in Anhui, even in whole China.</p>
