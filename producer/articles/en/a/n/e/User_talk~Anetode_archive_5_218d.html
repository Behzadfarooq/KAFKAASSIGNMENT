<h2><span class="mw-headline">Question</span></h2>
<p>Sorry to mess up the new...but I have a question for you....says on rule 1 of <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">WP:FUC</a> "if unfree material can be transformed into free material, it should be done instead of using a "fair use" defense."...my question is, is there anyway to turn any of the old radio and TV logos/images that are being deleted into free material? If so, how? Thanks...<a href="../../../o/r/a/User%7EOrangemonster2k1_ef23.html" title="User:Orangemonster2k1">SVRTVDude</a> 10:41, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK...some of these are from before 1963, some are not...most are not. In the cases that are, can they be readded? In the cases that are not, would a statement from the respective television and radio stations saying they don't mind the use for Wiki purposes knock it out of "fair-use" land? - <a href="../../../o/r/a/User%7EOrangemonster2k1_ef23.html" title="User:Orangemonster2k1">SVRTVDude</a> 11:29, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I've tried talking about it til my fingers were blue (little joke there)...that is what I thought I could use the "if unfree material can be transformed into free material, it should be done instead of using a "fair use" defense." page of <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">WP:FUC</a> #1 and "transform" the images/logos "into free material"....but wasn't sure exactly how to do that or what that would entail. - <a href="../../../o/r/a/User%7EOrangemonster2k1_ef23.html" title="User:Orangemonster2k1">SVRTVDude</a> 12:54, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Godzamba coat of arms</span></h2>
<p>The coat of arms <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godzamba.html" title="Godzamba">Godzamba</a> is with gold tree. You added picture with "natural color" tree. It is not the same coat of arms!</p>
<p>The proper version Godzamba coat of arms: <a href="http://www.akromer.republika.pl/godziemba.gif" class="external free" title="http://www.akromer.republika.pl/godziemba.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.akromer.republika.pl/godziemba.gif</a></p>
<p>Even if it belongs to the same clan. Members of a clan can differ with their coats of arms from other coats of armes of other members of the clan. To use an unproper version of coat of arms by noble family is a violation according to paper by Artur Ornatowski [<a href="http://przodek.pl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=225&amp;Itemid=177" class="external autonumber" title="http://przodek.pl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=225&amp;Itemid=177" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>].</p>
<p>with regards, <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Piotr_Glownia_9b56.html" title="User:Pan Piotr Glownia">Pan Piotr Glownia</a> 01:10, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Proper Godziemba coat of arms is the <b>natural brown</b> color pine tree. Picture: <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Herb_Godziemba.PNG" class="extiw" title="commons:Image:Herb_Godziemba.PNG">commons:Image:Herb Godziemba.PNG</a></p>
<p>Proper Godzyamba coat of arms is the <b>gold</b> color pine tree. Picture: <a href="http://www.akromer.republika.pl/godziemba.gif" class="external free" title="http://www.akromer.republika.pl/godziemba.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.akromer.republika.pl/godziemba.gif</a></p>
<p>In the Western Europe the same coat of arms could differ amongst members of the same noble family. In Poland the same (or almost the same) coat of arms could differ amongst families of the same noble clan. Also in the Western Europe special marks and signs were used on coats of arms to precise the type of individual owner. In Poland however these differences adress issues of how the particular Polish noble family came into ownership of their clan's coat of arms and terms on which they are entitled to it.</p>
<p>As it apears using unproper version of the coat of arms by a family is seen as violation (a false claim, which is done by a pretender). If it is done by other peoples, then it is usually judged as lack of knowledge on the subject, as it is stated in Polish language at: [<a href="http://przodek.pl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=225&amp;Itemid=177" class="external autonumber" title="http://przodek.pl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=225&amp;Itemid=177" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>]. Artur Ornatowski is some kind of expert in this area of knowledge in Poland and you can contact him [<a href="http://przodek.pl/index.php?option=com_contact&amp;catid=5&amp;Itemid=3" class="external autonumber" title="http://przodek.pl/index.php?option=com_contact&amp;catid=5&amp;Itemid=3" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>] for the medieval source materials he used to come to this conclusion.</p>
<p>If one would add Godzyamba coat of arms to Godziemba coat of arms (<a href="../../../../pl/g/o/d/Godziemba_%28herb_szlachecki%29.html" class="extiw" title="pl:Godziemba_(herb_szlachecki)">as I did already in Polish version</a>), then one had to put references that this version called Godzamba/Godzyamba specifically belongs to Glownia family. The already listed definition of the pine in Godziemba coat of arms refers to brown/natural pine and it is not description for Godzyamba coat of arms, in which version the pine is actually gold.</p>
<p>Also worth of notice is that Godziemba coat of arms is coat of arms of Polish nobility <a href="../../../../pl/h/e/r/herb_szlachecki_b650.html" class="extiw" title="pl:herb_szlachecki">pl:herb szlachecki</a>, when Godzyamba coat of arms before becaming Polish nobility's coat of arms was also knightly "ARMA BARONUM REGNI POLONIE" [<a href="http://www.akromer.republika.pl/herbarz_dlugosz.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.akromer.republika.pl/herbarz_dlugosz.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>] coat of arms.</p>

<dd>I recognize that you may have no knowledge about the Polish coats of arms or maybe just in this case. The picture provided by <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Mathiasrex" class="extiw" title="commons:User_talk:Mathiasrex">commons:User talk:Mathiasrex</a> is correct picture of Godziemba, but it is not correct picture of Godzyamba coat of arms. Godzyamba is not just alternative name of the Godziemba coat of arms. It is actually alternative coat of arms. Possible even an older start version of Godziemba coat of arms too. It is possible that these both coats of arms belong to the same noble clan, but they differ from each other, they are called differently and futhermore they do belong to different noble families. I just want to make sure you don't mix them so carelessly as you did by adding the picture, wherever you just find only some empty space&#160;;) on wikipedia.

<p>And of course you miss the entire point which deals mainly with having no rules about usertalk pages owned by IP addresses. Thanks a lot for being so kind and considerate. I'm sure you're just flowing with wiki love and compassion.</p>
<p>BTW might I suggest that you read <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_a_dick" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_a_dick" rel="nofollow">this</a> --Socko123 06:30, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Once again I would suggest that Wikipedia make a page that deals with issues pertaining to talkpages and also a better policy on IP addresses that wish to remain only IP addresses.--Socko123 06:53, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also it needs to be pointed out that the IP Address is used by multiple users and you blocked the ability to create accounts, perhaps someone from the IP would want to create an account and contribute to Wikipedia in a positive fashion. --Socko123 13:52, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>This account had been made before the IP had been blocked and yes I in fact have been blanking the talk page, I find there to be no reason to continue to keep past warnings on the page.</p>
<p>If you would look at the edit history of the IP the warnings have all come from editing the user talk page which, I do not believe is strictly prohibited, especially after the sentence of blocking has been served and there is no reason to keep that clutter around. To repeatedly get warned and blocked for deleting past warnings and blocking simply shows the reckless abandonment of due process for blocking. This only demonstrates to me that Wikipedia is less like a community of intellectual writers and editors and is more like the Wild West. Anyone with a "gun" (if you will) has the power to eliminate whatever he deems necessary without have to go through any due process and/or put any thought into the matter. Soon editors become heartless automaton that take no time to read edits or even involve themselves in the subject matter because the only thing that they feel they can do is fight the unrelenting fake edits. I believe sometimes that if an administrator was slapped in the face with a good and legitimate edit he would only revert it because of response conditioning.</p>
<p>Point: If the edit history of this institutional IP where checked you would find (though it is a long way down the list because I've been trying to clear the usertalk page for about a month) that there have been edits that have in fact benefited Wikipedia. I spent a good couple of hours putting united warnings at the top of pages without citations. You do whatever you feel is necessary, but know that I have lost much faith in the project because of the manner in which I have been treated by these bot like administrators. Have a good wiki day.--Socko123 19:51, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>So not to kick a dead horse but would it still be "vandalizing" now if I removed the talk page jargon now? Thanks for being civil by the way.--209.137.175.59 20:15, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree that it's harmless. It makes the page that much less professional, and if I hadn't investigated the user, it'd not have been reverted just an hour after it happened.

<p>Can you help me out here? This account was given a last warning on Jan 5th. On March 1st they re-appeared and vandalised the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> page. (Their only other three edits in the intervening period were also vandalism). I reported them at WP:AIV, and your note says: 'only edit was several hours ago, before warning'. Was I supposed to give them another 'last warning'? Yours, perplexed. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_MacDui_7612.html" title="User:Ben MacDui">Ben MacDui</a> <small><a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_MacDui_4891.html" title="User talk:Ben MacDui">(Talk)</a></small> 19:33, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The H. P. Lovecraft photo I uploaded was an actual author photo, but the author died in 1936. I thought that means the 70 year US copyright rule applies, and it's now in the public domain. Can you amend the rationale accordingly for me? Thanks. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuciferMorgan_f0d2.html" title="User:LuciferMorgan">LuciferMorgan</a> 20:22, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm saying it is a photo of H. P Lovecraft - I don't know who the author of the photograph. As he died in 1936, that means it was taken 71 years ago, and after 70 years I assumed photographs and copyrighted works end up in the public domain. My knowledge of copyright is only basic, so am I incorrect? <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuciferMorgan_f0d2.html" title="User:LuciferMorgan">LuciferMorgan</a> 20:35, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I thought it was 70 years after the photo was copyrighted to be honest, which would've made it public domain if it was copyrighted at the time the photo was taken. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuciferMorgan_f0d2.html" title="User:LuciferMorgan">LuciferMorgan</a> 20:44, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the clarification. The photo was taken 1936 or before - though I don't know the status. It's been a learning curve, so I'm grateful. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuciferMorgan_f0d2.html" title="User:LuciferMorgan">LuciferMorgan</a> 21:05, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello. I'm in help for dealing with constant vandalism on page: <a href="../../../k/o/r/MTV_Unplugged%7E_Korn_4dc0.html" title="MTV Unplugged: Korn">MTV Unplugged: Korn</a>. The case is someone constantly replaces b-side song which I made two footnotes for to make it fact with other song unrelated to this album, and I think it happens because these two songs contains the same line (No One's There) and that person presumably thinks I'm making mistake by putting "No One's There" and replaces it with title "I'm The One" (which is unrelated to this album, so it can't be a b-side, nor it was ever mentioned as a b-side, while these 2 footnoted songs are b-sides, and I put a lot of effort to make these footnotes). I'd like to get some help with dealing in this problem. I'll be very grateful.
