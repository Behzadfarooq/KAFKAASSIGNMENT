<p>Was <a href="../../../j/a/r/User%7EJaranda_ee94.html" title="User:Jaranda">Jaranda</a>'s prior speedy deletion of this article improper? I tagged the article with db-repost, since the article was identical to that listed in the deletion summary in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;page=Miloslav_Schmidt" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;page=Miloslav_Schmidt" rel="nofollow">deletion log.</a> I just added db-bio because that was also the original rationale given. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESertrel_a825.html" title="User:Sertrel">Sertrel</a> 22:10, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, and thanks for your redirect from Trail mix back to <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gorp.html" title="Gorp">Gorp</a> but the reason that I listed it for speedy deletetion (and it's my fault for not making this clear, so I apologize) is that on the talk page a concensus had been reached to move Gorp to Trail Mix (apparently the more common name). Unfortunately the user that initiated the move only copy/pasted it instead of using the move feature. It was my intentions to have Trail Mix deleted and then initiate the move that the user started. Since this seems to have been bungled so much I think I will just list it on requested moves.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Tribes redirect</span></h2>
<p>Okay, first thing's first, for some odd reason the link you posted in the original comment didn't show up when I viewed it. All I saw was "consider internal linking" and no link, so that probably added to confusion. My bad. Or my browser's bad. Whatever. Anyway, I honestly believe that more people will enter the term "Tribes" when trying to locate the game, not the social concept, but it's hard to prove that either way. WhatLinksHere is intriguing for the page, but if anything it just shows that people are being remarkably lazy in their internal linking, since linking to a redirect page is bad practice and there is no effective reason why the correct article name shouldn't be linked instead. What we really need is a gague of which article people are trying to find when using the search function, and I have an idea on how that can be figured out. I propose the Tribes page be changed, temporarily, to a page which contains links to the target pages in question, but asks users to mention on the talk page which one of them they were searching for. The links to the article from other articles would, of course, need to be corrected first, but they really should be fixed anyway. That way we should be able to get over a relatively short period of time a semi-accurate gague of which pages people are looking for when searching for "Tribes". Thoughts? -- <a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">Y|yukichigai</a> 22:55, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi there, I think the copyvio tag was appropriate because copyright does not require the source to be commercial content. If someone writes something, it is automatically copyrighted. It does appear that the author of the Web site is the same person that copied the content over to Wikipedia, so I'm sure it is fine.

<p>Sorry about not getting back to you right away. I am under the impression <a href="../../../m/o/b/MobyGames_678e.html" title="MobyGames">MobyGames</a> links were OK. This has been brought up before on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Computer_and_video_games_662f.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Computer and video games">the CVG Project</a> before. The consensus was that every game should link to the MobyGames entry. We usually don't link to review sites, but MobyGames is more than just a review site (and not all games they contain even contain reviews) and it is arguably the largest database of video games on the Internet. The <a href="../../../m/o/b/Template%7EMoby_game_59d0.html" title="Template:Moby game">Template:Moby_game</a> was created for that purpose. The rationale is that MG offers things usually not included in the pedia such as credits <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/ps2/oni/credits" class="external text" title="http://www.mobygames.com/game/ps2/oni/credits" rel="nofollow"><i>Oni Credit</i></a> cover art <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/indigo-prophecy/cover-art" class="external text" title="http://www.mobygames.com/game/indigo-prophecy/cover-art" rel="nofollow"><i>Indigo Prophecy cover art</i></a> screenshots <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/age-of-empires-iii/screenshots" class="external text" title="http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/age-of-empires-iii/screenshots" rel="nofollow"><i>Age of Empires III screen shots</i></a> blah blah blah.

<p>I am not disupting the 5.0 million figure, but the use of the given source as a verification. Perhaps the {{<a href="../../../c/h/e/Template%7ECheck_bc2f.html" title="Template:Check">check</a>}} tag wasn't the right one to use, but as I mentioned on the article's talk page, I'm not seeing anything in the given source that supports the number. Also, with respect to "Q4" number, Microsoft never said "fourth quarter", and the way it is presented in the article, it is implied that the estimate is for 10 million consoles by the end of the year, when there are several more weeks after "holiday" or "it's first year" or "the time the competition enters the market", which can mean several hundred thousand more units by the end of Q4. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDancter_895c.html" title="User:Dancter">Dancter</a> 17:23, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't know how to work with User talk: business so give guidance if necessary. I do not know what Paul Stanley image is in question but I have several and would put one into the public domain with attribution. Please check my KISS gallery at <a href="http://dwightmccann.com/ChumashCasinoResort/KISS072606.htm" class="external free" title="http://dwightmccann.com/ChumashCasinoResort/KISS072606.htm" rel="nofollow">http://dwightmccann.com/ChumashCasinoResort/KISS072606.htm</a> and let me know. <a href="../../../d/w/i/User%7EDwightmccann_ba73.html" title="User:Dwightmccann">Dwightmccann</a> 22:55, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>OK, this seems to be how it works, eh?&#160;:-) I will put one of the Paul Stanley's into the public domain. I am willing to put one image per concert/headliner into the public domain with attribution from each of the concerts I shoot at the casino or Maverick Saloon. I usually have 50 to 100 usable images and publish five to twenty-five. The casino or bar pays me to intially shoot them so they aren't Pro Bono images. I think it is good for the artist, good for the casino/bar and good for me. While it is a business it is also about community.

<p>Hi. Please stop renaming "Synopsis" to "Story" to justify the removal of spoiler tags. The section <i>synopsizes</i> the game's various plot elements, and thus the name. Renaming it "story" is needlessly confusing, because the game's actual story is only touched upon in the section's third subsection. In addition, the spoiler tags are not disruptively placed, so there is no reason to remove them. They simply serve as a way to <i>let the readers know</i> what kind of information is contained in the section, and thus to make the encyclopedia more friendly to the casual reader. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimmyBlackwing_9d7b.html" title="User:JimmyBlackwing">JimmyBlackwing</a> 09:31, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

Now I understand that you may be trying to impose a draconian standard of redundant rationales in album cover art images, but posting a warning that accuses me of violating Wikipedia policy on copyrights is a bit less polite than asking me to provide a more detailed rationale.

<dd>I'm sorry you took offence at the warning. I know you were acting in good faith and my warning should have been tailored appropriately. The problem is that this image has a fair-use rationale for one use but not for the other and has been used in the past in blatant violation of the license, solely to depict Hudgens. As such, the fair-use for this particular image has been a big problem and has been disputed many times. As such, we really require even a brief mention for each particular use of this image, as required by the license itself. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 16:01, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If this is not the proper way to send a message, my apologies. I went to go take the links down, but it looks like you, or someone else has already done so. The link, however, does belong in the Hip Hop Fashion wiki, because it is the best resource available for current information relating to hip-hop fashion.</p>
<p>You mentioned that Wikipedia prohibits the posting of links even if they are suitable. In what situation is posting a link ok? For example, there is a great Pigeon John interview on our site. Would it be against policy to post a link in his Wiki to that interview specifically? Similarly, if I were to write the first Wiki on a subject which we had covered, would it be ok to put that subject's feature as a link, or Format as a reference, in their Wiki?</p>

<p>Wanted to let you know I am still putting images into the Public Domain although I have switched over to putting my PhotoArt collages rather than individual images as the attribution is important to me but seems easily dropped. The collages, the production of which is part of my agreement with the Chumash Casino Resort, are somewhat self attributing. They also seem to add more "flavor" for many of the groups I have done, giving both clear, crisp and recent images as well as a sense of their performance productions. Since I am doing almost one act a week including collage I expect I will be a continuing contributor for the forseeable future. Perhaps I'll even get the urge to edit/create at some point. <a href="../../../d/w/i/User%7EDwightmccann_ba73.html" title="User:Dwightmccann">Dwightmccann</a> 23:47, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You have just reverted some Vandalisim where they have posted fake release dates. I had that fixed until you reverted it back, As for the specs I'll see that gets fixed but I'll have to make a minor revert to fix the other problems. <a href="../../../s/a/w/User%7ESawblade05_5812.html" title="User:Sawblade05">Sawblade05</a> 01:42, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">3RR Note</span></h2>
<p>To <a href="../../../s/a/w/User%7ESawblade05_5812.html" title="User:Sawblade05">User:Sawblade05</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/e/User%7EAnetode_cbff.html" title="User:Anetode">User:Anetode</a> and <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimmyJoeBobby_95d6.html" title="User:JimmyJoeBobby">User:JimmyJoeBobby</a>:</p>
<p>Please be careful when reverting - and remember the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">three revert rule</a>. This states that you cannot revert (i.e. remove or partially remove someonelse's edits) more than three times within 24 hours. The exception to this is "blatant, simple vandalism", which I don't think applies to <a href="../../../t/e/s/Test_Drive_Unlimited_509c.html" title="Test Drive Unlimited">Test Drive Unlimited</a>. On this, I think you have all either come very very closed or have broken the rule within the last day.</p>
<p>As Antefoe and Sawblade05 seem experienced and have reverted in good faith, whilst JimmyJoeBobby is new, I'm not going to take any action such as blocking - this is often done with the three revert rule, but I don't see how it would help here - but I encourage you all to remember that, whatever the situation, reverting is not a good way of editing on Wikipedia. The page is now protected so hopefully this can all be ironed out on the talk page. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 16:27, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't see how that first diff you gave me was blatant vandalism, though I accept that some of his were. As I say, I do believe that your reversions were in good faith; if I'm missing something about the specs that makes it vanadalism, then I apologise. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 19:42, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK; well just be warned that the policy only allows for 'simple' vandalism, for the very reason that it is almost impossible to tell the difference between a stupid good faith addition and complex vandalism. Thankfully, such a situation as you were in is quite unusual but in future I would have avoided reverting the edits of Sawblade05 whilst the vandalism was ongoing; it saves any possible accidental violations. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 09:36, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:RobsonWalton.jpg</b>. I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_criteria_7a9f.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use criteria">first fair use criterion</a> in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created. If you believe this image is not replaceable, please:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the image description page and edit it to add {{<a href="../../../r/e/p/Template%7EReplaceable_fair_use_disputed_a5fb.html" title="Template:Replaceable fair use disputed">Replaceable fair use disputed</a>}}</li>
<li>On the image discussion page, write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.</li>
</ol>
<p>Alternatively, you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject or by taking a picture of it yourself.</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified how these images fully satisfy our fair use criteria. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_de0d.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_de0d.html" rel="nofollow">this link</a></span>. Note that any fair use images which are replaceable by free-licensed alternatives will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html#Images.2FMedia" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">criteria for speedy deletion</a>.
