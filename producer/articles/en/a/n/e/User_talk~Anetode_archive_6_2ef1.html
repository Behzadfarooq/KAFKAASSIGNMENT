Hi there. Noticed you deleted the Koenigsegg CCXR page. However, the text on the page was not in copyvio of the page you claimed. The text was straight from the Koenigsegg press release, if I'm not mistaken. Also, it contained some interesting figures which I'd love to see back up, live, if nothing else...<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../n/a/y/User%7ENaylor83_63e5.html" title="User:Naylor83">Naylor83</a> (<a href="../../../n/a/y/User_talk%7ENaylor83_1c36.html" title="User talk:Naylor83">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Naylor83_97f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Naylor83">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">MMY Article</span></h2>
<p>With all due respect, I only restored my original text twice in a 24 hour period, not three times. And you will notice that I also modified Vijayante's few sentences the first time I did it to address his objections by amplifying the Beatles Anthology comments while doing so. Furthermore, as you know, I contacted Crum135 who had already blocked Vijayante once for misinterpreting BLP for advice on what to do about it, and gave Vijayante one more chance even though he'd already violated 3RR as he suggested. As a result, I think your assessment that I am contributing to the problem is unfair.</p>
<p>A cooling off period will not resolve the fundamental issue here, that balanced, sourced criticism should not be repeatedly deleted by an admitted member and advocate of the group without adequate justification. Just as the 24 hour ban did not change Vijayante's editing pattern, except that as he stated he tried to limit himself to the maximum limit for reversions per day. I am still seeking advice as to how to deal with this.</p>
<p>The issue I was addressing, really, is whether the first version is too apologetic given the well known controversy surrounding the Beatles split with MMY (my position), or whether the second is unsourced libel (vijayante's position).</p>

<p>This period in India and their apparent disillusionment with Maharishi was described in a book by Paul Salzmann, <i>The Beatles in India</i>, who was there at that time, and who met with and photographed the Beatles, Mia Farrow, Donovan and Mike Love of the Beachboys while there. He reports that: "To the Beatles, the Maharishi's apparent sexuality <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup>, was the heavy straw that broke the camel's back. They had earlier been concerned about two things: the Maharishi using them to promote himself, and what seemed to be his focus on money, unexpected by them in a spiritual teacher or holy man." <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Mia Farrow described what she interpreted to be a sexual advance during that visit by Maharishi in her book, <i>What Falls Away</i>.</p>

<p>Well I must admit I am very turned off after being a member of Wikipedia again for only a month. I did several edits for the Phish page back in 2005 but never set up an account. Now that the college I teach at has a 24 hour computer lab, I have been online much more and noticed that both the <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jon_Fishman_5161.html" title="Jon Fishman">Jon Fishman</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/g/Page_McConnell_8c68.html" title="Page McConnell">Page McConnell</a> pages were missing pictures. The thing that bothers me is that I read all of the rules and familiarized myself with the proper steps to upload photos before creating an account. I even used my real name and offered an email address to anyone who questioned their legitimacy. I was the text editor and photographer for the Phish Phactory back in 1999 and 2000 before Chris, my partner in the site, decided to shut it down back in 2003. My photos were on his site for years. Again, I read all of the rules and followed them exactly, or at least tried to.</p>
<p>What upset me was the meanness and accusatory tone that these Wikipedia users immediately threw my way. I don't know who or what this Sega thing is, but I wish it would just go away because some user erased my work and accused me of being this person. Now on my talk page there is some banner saying I am a part of the Sega ring or whatever it is. I wasn't aware that Wikipedia convicted new users before ever giving them a chance to explain themselves. I even offered my own personal email, to which no one responded. I can't make it any clearer.....these are my pictures, I scanned them onto the Phish Phactory back in 2000 and I still have the zip discs, from which they were uploaded onto Wikipedia. In addition, I also scanned a cover of my Marc Daubert CD "Parlor Tricks," which you can only buy from Marc himself, yet that was erased as well.</p>
<p>The other night, I was banned for basically standing by my work.....work that I have donated to Wikipedia to make it a better place. I was accused of WP:3RR, yet the users who have basically attacked me are doing the exact same thing! I've pretty much given up, as I am so disgusted by the cliquish and immature and, most of all, extremely unprofessional behavior of these various users that I am disappointed and basically uninspired to share my knowledge and work with Wikipedia. I could be a very positive contributor to this site, but the execution-without-trial behavior of these members has stifled what could be a very positive relationship. I am going to remove these unfounded accusations of me being someone else, and I am still going to offer my photographs to Wikipedia and re-upload them, because I feel it makes these pages better. Instead of banning a positive contributor, perhaps you should look into the elitist behavior of the users who try and erase everything I do because they think I am someone else. It's very sad that after the Essjay controversy and other bad news about Wikipedia that its members aren't motivated to be more fair and welcoming to new users.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Phish photograph copyright melee</span></h2>
<p>My reasoning could be completely erroneous, so I'm going to bounce the thoughts I'm having off of you before I share it with the participants of this argument.<br />
Regardless of who took the picture, it depicts a copyrightable act. Phish, as seen in the last paragraph <a href="http://www.phish.com/guidelines/index.php?category=6" class="external text" title="http://www.phish.com/guidelines/index.php?category=6" rel="nofollow">here</a>, still retains copyright on their performances: "All Phish performances and recordings are the exclusive property of Phish. All rights reserved." They DID NOT allow "video devices" -- that's the language, and, I would assume that includes still photography -- into their concerts. Therefore, it doesn't matter who took the picture, it can't be released into the public domain because Phish still has the copyright on the performance.<br />
Now, I would assume that a legally-taken photo of a concert would be able to be licensed much the same way as a screenshot, but, unless the photographer had permission to take photos, it doesn't really matter. So Frank, in addition to having to prove that <i>he</i> took the picture, would have to prove that he had <i>permission</i> to take the picture. And still, it can't be public domain.<br />
If my reasoning is correct, it would affect several photographs currently on <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phish.html" title="Phish">Phish</a> (<a href="../../../a/l/p/Image%7EAlpine.jpg_3f71.html" title="Image:Alpine.jpg">Image:Alpine.jpg</a> in particular) and some of its daughter articles, and, most likely, a couple of other pictures currently on WP. If I'm wrong -- and I sincerely hope I am -- then, you know, nevermind.... Back into the fray....<br />
Thanks for your help in this matter.<br />

<p>Thank you for the info. But unfortunately the claim that these are valid edits makes no sense. It's quite extreme to say Academy Awards and the mention of them is 'advertising'. And this user refuses to engage in discussion about the topic on actors pages or on the proper <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_Award_136f.html" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a> page. They would rather simply edit from an anon IP as a troll, ignore warnings from me and others and generally not add positively to the Wiki.</p>
<p>It was never my intention to let it get to simply posting warning upon warning, but how exactly do warnings work? Don't they alert admins somewhere on somepage something is up? If so, then why was it allowed to get to that state? If they don't work that way, are they simply a form of social shaming?</p>
<p>I'm genuinely interested because I want to be productive, but users like <a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.112.7.212.html#Academy_Award_Winner_Page_Vandalism" title="User talk:71.112.7.212">71.112.7.212</a> are clearly being trolls and clearly should be blocked.

<p>Ah, I guess I wasn't clear on why I made the page. I was/am unsure on whether or not Wikipedia should have small pages for words, such as, moreover, that simply provide a link to Wiktionary so when a user who may not be familiar with the Wikimedia projects searches for a word such as that they will not simply come to a blank "no queries found" page. However, I could not find any documentation on this matter in the help files and no one the IRC channels would be kind enough to respond to my queries. If this matter has already been discussed and resolved, I would be gracious if you would inform me of the policy on it or point me to a page or user who could.

<li>I disagree. It was being used to identify the character and costume design of Princess Sailor Moon.

<p>Hi there, I submitted article earlier today (March 23rd) on an organization called 'Rooster society' or just 'Rooster'. The little bit I had the opportunity to throw together was understandably deleted. I can see how it appears ficticious. It is a legitimate organization of college students. As a small organization in a local area, which has only been in existence for a few years, there are no verifyable references. Meetings are often held at parks/strip clubs accompanied by a few cases of beer. We have members at Fordham Univeristy, University of Nevada, Reno, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Nevada State University, Wyoming, and BYU. A number of us are entrepreneurs, and this helps us relay ideas and network. We also help with political events that support respectable candidates. How should I go about creating an article that will not get deleted? Thank You</p>

<p>Does that mean by flagging the Campbell River Mirror citations you consider them an unreliable source?</p>
<p>Further down it says: "Secondary sources are documents or people that summarize, analyze and/or interpret other material, usually primary source material. These are academics, journalists, and other researchers, and the papers and books they produce. A journalist's description of a traffic accident he did not witness, or the analysis and commentary of a president's speech, are secondary sources. Wikipedia articles should rely on reliable, published secondary sources wherever possible."</p>
<p>I would think that means newspaper articles are reliable sources.</p>

<p>I'm sorry, but I'm a little confused. Would you kindly direct me to the policy or guideline that specifically states that fair use images of living people are generally unacceptable? - <a href="../../../c/y/r/User%7ECyrus_XIII_14b0.html" title="User:Cyrus XIII">Cyrus XIII</a> 02:00, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, then I will have to add a specific fair-use rationale when re-inserting the image. Thanks for the heads up. - <a href="../../../c/y/r/User%7ECyrus_XIII_14b0.html" title="User:Cyrus XIII">Cyrus XIII</a> 02:11, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So in other words, as long as a notable person is not dead, we will leave the respective article unillustrated, while waiting patiently for someone to provide a free image, no matter how unlikely that might be in certain circumstances? - <a href="../../../c/y/r/User%7ECyrus_XIII_14b0.html" title="User:Cyrus XIII">Cyrus XIII</a> 02:25, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Re: Riya Sen images</span></h2>
<p>On March 10 you deleted two images I uploaded for use in the <a href="../../../r/i/y/Riya_Sen_d5a8.html" title="Riya Sen">Riya Sen</a> article - <a href="../../../a/n/a/Image%7EAnanthabhadram_Riya.jpg_2534.html" title="Image:Ananthabhadram Riya.jpg">Image:Ananthabhadram Riya.jpg</a> and Image:Riya Book.png. I don't mind the second image getting deleted really, as I proposed to <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> that it be put to IFD, anways (though I don't agree to you conclusion - "A photograph is a photograph is a photograph" - Wikipedia doesn't seem to agree either). But, the first one was film screen shot, and in context could very well be considered a fair use image. Your reason for deletion was - "no rationale since march 10" - but, I was never notified about this lack of rationale. Isn't it a guideline that the uploader be notified to make amends, if possible, before deletion (or may be when tagging it for <i>no rationale</i>). I could have then, at least, try to provide a rationale, and/or start an article on the film and shift it there. I never knew there was this problem with the image.</p>
<p>This is the very reason I keep insisting on a discussion before deletion, though I know a discussion can be tedious work (well, if WP has come up with new guideline to do away with all screen shots on actor pages then I have nothing to say). I have a request to make - would you care to undelete the image and let me give another chance at providing a appropriate rationale? It may even involve some work on the article itself, including more references for authenticity. Please, answer to <a href="../../../a/d/i/User_talk%7EAditya_Kabir_1620.html" title="User talk:Aditya Kabir">my talk page</a>. <a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAditya_Kabir_e8b8.html" title="User:Aditya Kabir">Aditya Kabir</a> 16:06, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have started articles on both <a href="../../../a/n/a/Ananthabhadram.html" title="Ananthabhadram">Ananthabhadram</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/b/Dabboo_Ratnani_35eb.html" title="Dabboo Ratnani">Dabboo Ratnani</a>, can they be proper pages for a fair use of the images? Please, understand that knowledge and fairness are my issues here, not as much getting the images back to WP. The only reason for getting them back is the painstaking work involved with citing sources, and explaining the rationale. Please, advise. <a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAditya_Kabir_e8b8.html" title="User:Aditya Kabir">Aditya Kabir</a> 18:12, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><small><i>Discussion at <a href="../../../a/d/i/User_talk%7EAditya_Kabir_1620.html#Re:_Riya_Sen_images" title="User talk:Aditya Kabir">User talk:Aditya Kabir#Re: Riya Sen images</a>.</i></small></p>
<p>I was keeping track of Image:Riya Book.png, NOT <a href="../../../a/n/a/Image%7EAnanthabhadram_Riya.jpg_2534.html" title="Image:Ananthabhadram Riya.jpg">Image:Ananthabhadram Riya.jpg</a>. That's the screen shot, and that's the image I was not notified about. And, that deletion DID come as a surprise. I guess we are confusing the two images here. And, as you said, I did take a look into FU image policies every now and then which does quote a <i>case by case</i> approach, not a blanket call (and it is NOT <i>clearly the model's appearance, in this case</i>). Well, I give up. They've been deleted already, and this discussion makes little sense anymore. Sorry to bother you (I really mean it, dear, you have already accepted a tough job without user's pestering you).</p>
<p>I wish image patrolling was not as hectic as it is now, and particular images could have more attention (as in a more discursive process of decision making). May be some other time, when the articles and the rationale are really in place and <i>really</i> conform to the policies in the most unambiguous manner possible, I can have them back (you see, I still believe in both of the images, only I don't have the support ready to justify them <i>unquestionably</i>). One last question - is there any spelled out guideline specifically for movie screen shots anywhere? If there is one I'd like to be led to it. Cheers. <a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAditya_Kabir_e8b8.html" title="User:Aditya Kabir">Aditya Kabir</a> 12:46, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks. This is what I meant by giving me another chance. I have no intention of cluttering WP with unfair images (I have already read through the legal implications). You just have strengthened my belief in the WP community. Cheers. <a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAditya_Kabir_e8b8.html" title="User:Aditya Kabir">Aditya Kabir</a> 18:40, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
