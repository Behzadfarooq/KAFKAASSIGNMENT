<h2><span class="mw-headline">John Nelson (convert)</span></h2>
<p>Anetode, I have no problem with your point (i.e. considered) and have given reasons for changing my vote on this from delete to keep. The point I have been trying to make is that there is no scholarship or research on the existence of John Nelson. He may or may not have existed. All that is known of him is that he is mentioned in passing in a 16th century work that compiled supposed eyewitness accounts in Tripoli.</p>
<p>Based on that work, serious and reputable scholars have cited him as an early or first known British convert to islam (and this has been relayed by the BBC and other media outlets). However, to my knowledge, the veracity of the original account has not been examined (and would be extremely difficult to verify). I raise these points because the history of travel literature, going back to Marco Polo, Mandeville or even the Greeks is rife with exaggeration or even fiction designed to appeal to readers in a sensationalistic fashion. Accounts of enslaved British sailors were bestsellers from at least the 17th century. Like Shakespeare's plays, they can not always be relied on as historical sources. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 22:02, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Point well taken. Would you object to "According to Richard <a href="../../../h/a/k/Hakluyt.html" title="Hakluyt">Hakluyt</a>'s <i>The voyage made to Tripolis</i>, John Nelson was the first <a href="../../../e/n/g/English.html" title="English">English</a> convert to Islam." under a ==Trivia== heading? --<a href="../../../a/n/e/User%7EAnetode_cbff.html" title="User:Anetode">Anetode</a> 22:18, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's fine, "considered" is fine too. The source, as with everything on the wiki, naturally should be cited. It would be interesting to find out more about Nelson and possible earlier converts. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 23:02, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No, the image was not appropriately licensesd. A "free" image on Wikipedia is not one that Wikipedia has been allowed to use, but one that Wikipedia is allow to distribute freely, so that it can be used for any purpose. The license on that image was restrictive, prohibiting re-sale and use for certain purposes. It would be very helpful if he agreed to license it under the GFDL, but then he'd effectively be giving up the restrictions he explicitly placed on it, so it seems unlikely to happen. <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_g2s_b24e.html" title="User:Ed g2s"><font face="verdana">ed g2s</font></a> • <a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_g2s_9b37.html" title="User talk:Ed g2s"><font face="verdana">talk</font></a> 13:40, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Don't launch these empty platitudes at me, *you* do not represent the entire Wikipedia community. Further, the merges were made as good faith efforts to improve the coverage of the SoD topic, and the decision behind proceeding with them was made with consideration of talk page discussions. You did not offer any objections to the mergers proposed on these talk pages before I acted, am I supposed to somehow read your mind?

<p>My apologies for the deletion fo crical secitions of Scientology in the article. Thank you for re=posting my additions to the article. You have to understand that the whole "Xenu" section has nothing to do with Scientology or any Scientologist. Except in that it is an alleged incedent that is meant to be addressed throught counselling at a certain point on what is known as "the Bridge". It is totally irrelevent to the doctrines and fundamental beliefs of Scientology and is not a belief of any scientologist or the "huge secret" Scientology's critics make it out to be, in an attempt to make Scientology look like a foolish belief system in aliens. I personally find such a post as this "Xenu" section offensive and irrelevant to the subjuect of Scientology as a Religion, which is what this page is supposed to be. This is my viewpoint on the matter, and I do appreciate your actions in attempting to be a fair arbitrator of this Wikipedia page. But to make a comparison, if I posted a section on the Christianity Wikipedia page that described at length the Essene Gospel scripture (which may or may not be fabricated or altered much like the Xenu story) that describes Jeses having sex with a young boy, I'm sure it would be looked at as religious bigotry and too irrelevant to the subject of Christianity as a religion to be posted on the page.</p>
<p>My opinion may not be popular, since I have seen few postings to the Scientology page that are not done by critics of Scientology or ex-Scientologists, but only ask you to consider my opinion and to do what you percieve as just as an arbitrator to the Scientology Wikipedia page. Once again, I do appreicate you reposting my veritable comments about L Ron Hubbard's other professions, and I do not wish to sound antagonistic.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.22.52.165.html" title="User:69.22.52.165">69.22.52.165</a> (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.22.52.165.html" title="User talk:69.22.52.165">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.22.52.165_66da.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.22.52.165">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>Also, you said, <i>"Note also that Wikipedia is not a proper place to publicize a business as articles have to meet certain notability guidelines."</i> I do not understand that either.

<p>The second one I am not as sure about. They are quite big in Fayetteville, Arkansas, and even bigger in the Video Game music community in the United States. They may apply to more than those two.

<p>your edit summary states: "Anetode (Talk | contribs) (reworded part of the lead sentense. it's important to mention the diagnosis of mental problems as hubbard's methodology differs from modern psychology)" And I want to say, the introduction of that article has been a main discussion for some while on its discussion page. Dianetics is not "mental therapy" though Hubbard's early (1950's) presentation of it, with the "patient" on a couch, much resembled mental therapy at the time. But even in those days Hubbard preferred the term "therapy" to "mental therapy" and it isn't presented as a "mental therapy." Today the Dianetics website <a href="http://www.dianetics.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dianetics.org" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>] doesn't present it as a therapy at all. Please feel completely free to introduce the concepts of the differences, please feel completely free to edit the article to suit your understanding of "Dianetics" but please discuss changes to the introduction on <a href="../../../d/i/a/Talk%7EDianetics_e58f.html" title="Talk:Dianetics">Talk:Dianetics</a> because it has been a major point of contention for a long time. Thank you. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 11:15, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hubbard's semantic posturing is largely irrelevant. As I noted on the talk page, what matters most is providing unbiased coverage of what Dianetics is perceived as. It is currently viewed as a type of therapy, albeit a controversial and largely discredited one. My edit elaborated on this by stating that Dianetics is a "method of diagnosis and treatment of psychological problems". Whatever Dianetics is presented as in Scientology, it still serves the same function. ˉˉ<sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User%7EAnetode_cbff.html" title="User:Anetode"><b>anetode</b></a></sup>╞<a href="../../../a/n/e/User_talk%7EAnetode_6721.html" title="User talk:Anetode">┬</a>╡ 00:15, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I appreciate that you said so, Anetode. I'm not sure how to approach the subject with you because the Dianetics website <a href="http://www.dianetics.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dianetics.org" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> says nothing at all about "diagnosis" nor does it mention "treatment" nor "psychologogical problems" and so I'm at a loss of what the entry point of communication with you would be. Are you saying that Dianetics does some diagnosis but calls it a different word, or some kind of treatment but calls it a different term, or some sort of clarification, analysis or codification of psychological problems but calls them by different terms? Or are you saying instead that Dianetics is viewed that way, no manner what wordage Hubbard used? <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 00:24, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay, I'm glad I understand too. What Diagnosis does Dianetics do? I actually don't know of any, nor any treatment of psychological problems based on such diagnosis. If there is a primary source on this, then it should probably be included in the introduction of the <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dianetics.html" title="Dianetics">Dianetics</a> article. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 00:31, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You stated about this introduction, stated to me, "As I noted on the talk page, what matters most is providing unbiased coverage of what Dianetics is perceived as" and I want you to understand that is not how Wikipedia suggests articles be introduced. I'm going to do my best to introduce the subject. After that of course, anyone is free to post any controvery or point of view they can support, but the subject needs an introduction of what it is, not how it is perceived to exist.<a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 02:31, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It would hardly be encyclopedic to introduce Dianetics as "a dubious therapy" because "dubious" is an evaluation. Better, don't you think, to introduce Dianetics, more or less as its website introduces it, monitored by the experience and viewpoint of many editors. And then, after its introduction, present by verifications and publications, its "dubious" (or any other) nature? <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 03:02, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Your post on my page, "pissing in the wind" kind of sounds like a second dismissal. My point is that Dianetics should be introduced.<a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 03:10, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Tactical shooter</span></h2>
<p>Thanks for your suggestion. I came across a very cheap copy of Delta Force in my local toy store. It's a bit fire heavy and lacks the stealth I like, but I like it nonetheless. SWAT 3 appears to be sold no longer in my local shops (They only have SWAT 4 which I can't run) so I'll try buying that online. Do you know of any free stealth/tactical games I could download somewhere? - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 20:16, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
