<p>"He would only refer to himself as "W. Rose", however, as he did not wish to share a name with his biological father."</p>
<p>This sentence makes no sense to me. His biological father's name IS Rose, so why would Axl want to be called like that as well, if he dislikes him?</p>
<p>Of course it makes sense if his father has the same first name as he does. Rose is not that uncommon.</p>

<p>"<i>Many consider Rose one of rock and roll's three greatest frontmen...</i>"</p>
<p>I did a quick google on "rock greatest frontmen" and although Axl's name is mentioned a lot, I don't see him anywhere in the top three. Is there some poll or VH1-style list which places Axl at #3? IMHO: Rock and Roll has had so many great frontmen that the the word "greatest" is misapplied within an encyclopedic context, except for Elvis of course.&#160;; ^)</p>
<p>Axl Rose's name....</p>
<p>His real name was - William Bailey, teehee, Bill Bailey. But he found out his biological father's name was Rose thus he changed it to William Rose. The Axl part wasn't added on purpose to make his name an anagram for Oral Sex, it was a name of a band he used to be in with Izzy Stradlin. Izzt told Axl - "You live and breath Axl so you might as well be Axl". So he changed his name to Axl and by coincidence ( and a dirty mind ) you can make Oral Sex out of it. - Bex-</p>
<p>Why does it say he was born William Bruce Bailey when he wasnt? He was BORN William Bruce Rose but had his name changed to Bailey when he was two after his mother re-married. I read in a book that Axl's birthname was William Bruce Bailey. He then later changed his last name to Rose. --<a href="../../../s/n/k/User%7ESnkcube_67da.html" title="User:Snkcube">Snkcube</a> 03:29, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article says:</p>
<pre>
<b>W. Axl Rose</b> .... born as <b>William Bruce Bailey</b>...
</pre>
<p>And then says:</p>
<pre>
His biological father, William Rose, left the family when Axl
was two. His mother <i>later married Stephen Bailey</i>, and his 
surname was <i>changed to Bailey</i>.
</pre>
<p>(emphasis mine)<br />
My guess is that the second passage is the correct one, and that Axl was probably born William Bruce Rose (Jr.?), then changed to William Bruce Bailey at age 2, then changed back to his birth name at age 17 (or to the abbreviated form "W. Rose" as stated further down in the article, meaning that for some period of time, his first name was legally a single letter?)

<p>i remember it being stated in an interview that his first name is just 'w'. his reasoning was because 'william' (his father) was an asshole so it's just W. i don't feel like looking for it, but it's definitely true if anyone cares to pursue it. --<a href="../../../e/l/y/User%7EElysianfields_8b58.html" title="User:Elysianfields">Elysianfields</a> 21:22, 25 August 2005 (UTC))</p>
<hr />
<p>IIRC, he was born William Rose, changed to William Bailey at two years old when his mother remarried, changed back to William Rose at 17 when he discovered the identity of his biological father, added Axl as his middle name, and subsequently shortened his first name to just "W" because of his unwillingness to share a first name with his real father. Some reports give that at some point he was called William Bruce Bailey, but whether Bruce was his given middle name at birth (William Bruce Rose?) is unclear. It is also possible that his first name was shortened before the Axl was added, that will have to be verified as well. Currently, his name is W Axl Rose. <a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPhantompong_35d3.html" title="User:Phantompong">P</a> 16:21, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>These four sources say that he was born <i>Rose</i>, took on <i>Bailey</i>, then changed back to <i>Rose</i> at 17.

<p>The caption of Axl at the KoRn party said <i>He has taken on a very similar appearance to <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Johnson_45d9.html" title="Martin Johnson">Martin Johnson</a> in his old age.</i> This rugby player is of a much darker complexion, has black hair instead of red, and is pretty clean-shaven.

<dd>Yeah it'd be interesting to hear his voice in an audio interview or something.

<dd>If you want to hear his voice, hear's a link to a radio interview with him: mms://kroq.wmod.llnwd.net/a168/o1/kbaudio/axel.asf He really has a pretty normal speaking voice.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Uhm, his speaking voice is sometimes kind of low and horse. But it isn't high at all.</p>
<p>Don't think he has a girly voice at all.</p>

Also, about controversy, the "Axl of old" would have flipped the crowd off and went home and WOULDN'T gone back out on stage after the crowd throwing things, shoddy work on the stage, and a poor soundbooth.</p>
<p>If you want to hear his voice,just listen to "K-DST" on the radio in GTA&#160;: Sand Andres,he is the DJ, Tommy "The Nightmare" Smith <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_revan_4c65.html" title="User:Lord revan">Lord revan</a> 10:01, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Categories</span></h2>
<p>When I accessed this article on May 16, 2006, there were no categories other than those that were spawned by the three stub tags in use. I thought that to be a little weird, so I added <b>1962 births</b>, <b>American musicians</b>, <b>Eccentrics</b>, <b>Grand Theft Auto actors</b>, and <b>People from Indiana</b>. I suspect whoever removed the categories prior to this date did so accidentally. Please add more categories, as the five I added aren't enough, if you think of any.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">removed category</span></h2>
<p>I removed the category "LGBT Opposition" from this article. The editor cited a "2003 or 2004 <i>Rolling Stone</i> quote," but Axl Rose didn't <i>do</i> any interviews with RS in either of those years. There <i>is</i> the song <a href="../../../o/n/e/One_in_a_Million_7326.html" title="One in a Million">One in a Million</a> and some quotes in a 1989 RS interview...but he has since recanted and explained the views expressed in that song in subsequent interviews. He's also performed with gay and bisexual performers. I really don't think he belongs on a page with the KKK and Jerry Falwell or anyone else who actively opposes LGBT rights.</p>
