<p>I've a few questions about these drugs, not sure if the answers are worthy of being included in either entry, this is more my personal curiosity! What was Boot's motivation to develop ibuprofen? Which has the greater anti-inflammatory effect at their respective standard doses (or is there no significant difference?) Which has the lower incidence/severity of side-effects at standard doses? Hope you can help&#160;:). <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDan100_0edd.html" title="User:Dan100">Dan100</a> 13:07, Dec 21, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>To answer your first question: I don't know. I assume that Boots recognised the anti-inflammatory effect either <i>in vitro</i> or in an animal model, and took it from there.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding your second question, I have found only one helpful reference: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=7923312" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=7923312" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However Nelson <i>et al</i>. used only 200 mg of ibuprofen against only 500 mg of aspirin. The respective highest single standard-release doses (as recommended by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain) are 600 mg and 900 mg. In short, my answer is: I don't know.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For your third question, I didn't find any comparison of side-effects at given doses. So my answer is: (you've guessed it) I don't know. However, ibuprofen does not have the same degree of antiplatelet effect that aspirin has. The incidence of (non-gastrointestinal) bleeding is lower with ibuprofen than with aspirin.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If an anti-inflammatory drug is required, I suggest that ibuprofen is superior to aspirin because of aspirin's antiplatelet effect. If an antiplatelet effect is required, aspirin is king. <a href="../../../a/x/l/User%7EAxl_2118.html" title="User:Axl">Axl</a> 15:24, 21 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

(Aspergesic 1,000 sachet)) has been compared to 400-mg ibuprofen tablets t.d.s. in a randomized double-blind trial in patients with rheumatoid arthritis using double-dummy technique. Both drugs proved effective in relieving symptoms. Three patients experienced drug-related side-effects with Aspergesic, and one patient with ibuprofen, that necessitated early discontinuation of treatment. Aspergesic was associated with a greater number of haemoglobin values falling below the normal range than ibuprofen. At the end of the study, eight out of 10 patients who expressed a preference selected Aspergesic for improving mobility whilst 15/24 selected Aspergesic for improving pain."</dd>

<dd>Again, I only have the abtract. The aspirin dose, 1.8 g tds, seems (to me) to be a particularly large dose, while the ibuprofen dose, 400 mg tds, is more representative. This would explain aspirin's greater efficacy, and also its (probably) increased incidence of side-effects.</dd>

There was statistical evidence for greater adverse effects of aspirin/codeine on mood and mental alertness in comparison to ibuprofen/codeine and placebo. Ibuprofen/codeine had a more favorable adverse effect profile than aspirin/codeine. A mild respiratory and cardiac depressant effect attributable to codeine was evident in all active treatment groups after 7 days of frequent therapy. More work needs to be done to elucidate the factors regulating the development of tolerance to the respiratory and cardiovascular depressant effects of opiates in general, and for codeine in particular."</dd>

<dd>Busson M. Update on ibuprofen: review article. <i>Journal of International Medical Research</i> 1986:14(2);53-62. "Prior to 1969, a limited number of NSAID drugs were available. Aspirin and indomethacin became the mainstay of treatment but tolerability, particularly gastric irritation, at doses necessary to control rheumatic symptoms limited the usefulness of these valuable agents. The pyrazolone, phenylbutazone, showed slightly better gastro-intestinal tolerability but has since been associated with an increased risk of blood dyscrasiae and is now only available for restricted use in most countries. Ibuprofen was the first of a new breed of NSAIDs originally introduced into the United Kingdom in 1969. Chemically quite distinct from its forerunners it was the first of the propionic acid derivatives to be used in rheumatic practice. The propionics have since become the largest, single and most important group of NSAIDs accounting for 50% of NSAID prescriptions in the United Kingdom. It is estimated that over 100 million patients worldwide have received ibuprofen which is now available in over 100 countries throughout the world including all the major markets. Ibuprofen was developed directly as a result of the problems associated with the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and also because of the gastro-intestinal irritation and general intolerability of the established NSAIDs, at that time. Ibuprofen was readily accepted because, unlike the previous drugs, its therapeutic efficacy was easily seen to outweigh the severity of its side-effects. Ibuprofen was the first new drug with the potency of aspirin but without its major disadvantages."</dd>

<li>Thanks, Axl. Impressive research. I found the Busson (1986) article particulary interesting, as that's exactly what my mother remembers from the time ibuprofen was introduced&#160;:). Do you think there would be any merit in including summaries of this information on the respective drug pages? <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDan100_0edd.html" title="User:Dan100">Dan100</a> 23:24, Dec 22, 2004 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Hi Axl. Nice research there. Thought I'd just mention that anything that inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), i.e. all NSAIDs, will inhibit platelet aggregation as this inhibits the synthesis of thromboxane A2 (TxA<sub>2</sub>)). The main point-of-difference with aspirin is that it is the only NSAID to irreversibly inhibit COX-1, thus explaining its efficacy as an antiplatelet agent. As for the adverse drug reaction issue - there was also the recent Paracetamol, Aspirin and Ibuprofen New Tolerability (PAIN) study reported by <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=12723744" class="external text" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=12723744" rel="nofollow">Moore (2004)</a>, where apparently ibuprofen had an even lower incidence of ADRs than paracetamol - though the design of this study has been criticised by some academics here in Australia. I don't have any references off the top of my head (probably in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Medicines_Handbook_0c4c.html" title="Australian Medicines Handbook">AMH 2004</a>), but it's commonly accepted that ibuprofen at less than 1200mg daily has better safety profile than other NSAIDs. This benefit is lost, however, for doses greater than 1200mg daily. Efficacy of NSAIDs is dose-dependent with considerable interindividual variability, so it's difficult to say whether any one NSAID is more efficacious than another. Thought I'd also mention, for completeness, that there hasn't really been any good evidence for the benefit of COX-2 inhibitors over "conventional" NSAIDs. And now it seems that the coxibs and naproxen increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular events... -<a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETechelf_1565.html" title="User:Techelf">Techelf</a> 04:57, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, I suppose that it depends on how you define "good evidence". There are several RCTs that show a beneficial side-effect profile. Here is one: Hegi TR, <i>et al</i>. Effect of rofecoxib on platelet aggregation and blood loss in gynaecological and breast surgery compared with diclofenac. <i>British Journal of Anaesthesia</i> 2004:92(4);523-531. "In this double-blind, active controlled study, women undergoing vaginal hysterectomy (n=25) or breast surgery (n=25) under general anaesthesia received preoperatively 50 mg of rofecoxib followed 8 and 16 hours later by two doses of placebo or three doses of diclofenac 50 mg at the same time points.... In the rofecoxib group, stimulated platelet aggregation was disturbed less (p=0.02), and estimated intraoperative blood loss (p=0.01) and the decrease in haemoglobin were lower (p=0.01). At similar pain ratings, the use of anti-emetic drugs was less in the rofecoxib group (p=0.03)."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This is from a review article: Lazzaroni M, Bianchi-Porro G. Gastrointestinal side-effects of traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and new formulations. <i>Alimentary Pharmacology and Therapeutics</i> 2004:20(Suppl.2);48-58. "The selective COX-2 inhibitors (rofecoxib, celecoxib, parecoxib, etoricoxib, valdecoxib, lumiracoxib) show consistently comparable efficacy to that of conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, but have a significantly reduced propensity to cause gastrointestinal toxicity. In many cases, the gastric effects of therapeutically active doses of COX-2 inhibitors are indistinguishable from placebo. The safety benefits of COX-2 inhibitors given alone appear similar to combined therapy with conventional NSAIDs and gastroprotective agents. These findings warrant the consideration of COX-2 inhibitors as first-line therapy in patients requiring long-term pain control."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In my opinion, the COX-2 inhibitors do show fewer gastrointestinal side-effects. However, as you pointed out, Kieren, the cardiovascular effects are worrying (and led to withdrawal of rofecoxib). While their use as analgesics may soon decline, there may be some potential in the treatment of cancer.</dd>

<p>If asprin irreversibly inhibits cox-1, what about its effects on cox-2, are those irreverible too? Is the chemical mechanism of irreversibility against one and not the other understood on the basis of asprin or functional site structure? Is there any "rebound" production of cox-1 in response to asprin? thanx, --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 16:00, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, Silverback. Sorry about the delay in my response. I have just moved jobs and I am rather more busy now, with less time to spend surfing. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2. In general, irreversible inhibitors do not bind to the functional site of the target; rather they bind at another place. The new chemical bonds distort the architecture of the target, altering the shape and/or charge of the functional site. I don't know for sure about your third question. However I would expect an increase in COX production. <a href="../../../a/x/l/User%7EAxl_2118.html" title="User:Axl">Axl</a> 08:24, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It is interesting that a single compound inhibits both and doesn't target the functional site, because it is the functional site that one would expect to be conserved and remain similiar while the non-functional parts diverge. The enzymes must have diverged only recently, or perhaps the aspirin site has role in the function that causes it to also be conserved. -- thanx, --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 10:06, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It is likely that the non-functional sites on COX-1 and COX-2 to which aspirin binds are probably <i>not quite</i> identical. Irreversible binding tends to be slightly less site-specific than reversible inhibition. <a href="../../../a/x/l/User%7EAxl_2118.html" title="User:Axl">Axl</a> 20:25, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry for my delayed response, as I've been away too. You're right that aspirin irreversibly binds to both COX-1 and COX-2. It covalently modifies COX by acetylation of Ser<sub>530</sub> in COX-1 and the corresponding Ser<sub>516</sub> residue in COX-2. This results in steric hindrance, preventing the natural ligand (arachidonic acid) from reaching the catalytic site. Aspirin is indeed more selective for COX-1, which I agree is probably due to subtle differences in the structure of the isozymes. <a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETechelf_1565.html" title="User:Techelf">Techelf</a> 08:47, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
Anybody wants the PAIN paper, I can provide it (nicholas.moore@pharmaco.u-bordeaux2.fr). I still do not understand the "methdological flaws" stuff in Australia. This was ranting by a guy with vested interests against ibuprofen going in supermarkets, and who really doesn't know much about clinical trials and plays in the hands of competition (beware of the marketing interests ion drug assessment...)</p>
<p>For other stuff: Cox2 inhibitors have no efficacy benefit. They may even be less effective painkillers than non-selective NSAIDs (some of the pain is Cox1 dependent). The benefit is only on GI safety, and this was proven mainly in extremely artificial conditions (long term continuous use at high doses, no gastroprotection allowed). We have just finished a 46000 patient study of Coxibs and NSAIDs in France, and the real-life rates of GI bleeding are 10 to 100 time lower thn in those clinical trials (because of good risk management by prescribers.and there is no difference between coxib or NSAID + PPI, with the added advantage of the latter that it also treats reflux and dyspepsia. So it really boils down to a cost perspective, which should improve even more with cheaper PPI. Or avoid Coxibs if your fear the cardiovascular risk (also very much exaggerated, at least for the lower dose Vioxx. In fact there was as little real reason for the hype whenit was put on the market as when it was removed... have a nice day NMooreBx 16:59, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hypocortisolism and hypothyroidism both increase ADH secretion. This is in the Emedicine article on hyponatremia and confirmed by a smaller study I just read on hyponatremia in alcoholics. Don't ask me the molecular mechanism. By the way, I <i>did</i> respond to your post but it was archived&#160;:-) <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 21:55, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the reference (and the education).&#160;:-) Apparently, CRH stimulates ADH secretion. The lack of negative feedback from cortisol on CRH during hypocortisolism leads to increased ADH. Also, hypocortisolism itself reduces cardiac output. (I couldn't find your response in your archive. Perhaps it was lost in the shuffle?) <a href="../../../a/x/l/User%7EAxl_2118.html" title="User:Axl">Axl</a> 11:09, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The edit war is over an infobox. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Gohde_2a7a.html" title="User:John Gohde">John Gohde</a> is convinced he can save the world by embellishing all his articles with a totally redundant piece of extra formatting that (falsely) indicates some relationship between all sorts of non-mainstream medicine. I think this is going to be an <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAr_9ea1.html" title="WP:RFAr">arbitration</a> case sooner or later.</p>
<p>My history with John goes back to last year, when he was no further than he is now with the WikiProject Alternative medicine. I have requested numerous times that he concentrate on content, e.g. what herbal interventions are used in arterial hypertension, or what the rationale might be for magnetic insoles in plantar fasciitis. So far, this has not been forthcoming.</p>
<p>When John returned a few weeks ago I offered my suport in resurrecting the infoboxes in return for some civility and cooperativity. I got shouted at, then got my postings from his talkpage deleted, and firmly resolved to let this user fend by himself. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 09:03, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for your help in correcting 'diffuse pleural thickening' and 'plaques'. However, I am still not sure of the difference. Could you explain? I have found them used interchangeably or described as the same, such as this from the Department of Health &amp; Human Services (US):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Asbestosis can manifest as pleural or parenchymal fibrosis or both. Pleural asbestosis, more properly termed "asbestos-related pleural abnormalities," is the most common finding in asbestos-induced pulmonary disease and, as described previously, involves pleural thickening, often manifested as discrete pleural plaques. Pleural plaques can be seen radiologically as bilateral images of hyalin scar formation on either the visceral or, much more commonly, the parietal pleural surfaces.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I left your edit, but am curious as to what the difference is. Thank you!MollyBloom 01:53, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
