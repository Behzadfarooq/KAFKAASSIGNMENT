<p>Perhaps the mishappen translation was on purpose similiar to blizzrad. Now you've got the folks at Square-Enix banging there heads up and down on the desk saying how did we mess that up?

<p>Hi. I noticed that you have taken part in the recent <a href="../../../r/o/a/User_talk%7ERoad_Wizard_Legend_of_Zelda_CfD_discussion_f4c1.html" title="User talk:Road Wizard/Legend of Zelda CfD discussion">discussion</a> about the future of the Legend of Zelda categories. I am just leaving this note to let you know that Proposal 1 (merging all game sub-categories) has been successful, and I will be relisting it at CfD later today. Of the renaming proposals, only option 7 appears to have gained a consensus in support. However, I am going to leave that discussion open a few more days as we have had a related proposal (No. 11) that has not yet been discussed. Please use this time to consider whether you wish to support or oppose the new proposal, or in any way change your previous votes. I will be reassessing the situation at about 18:00, 6 July 2006 (UTC). <a href="../../../r/o/a/User%7ERoad_Wizard_b7b6.html" title="User:Road Wizard">Road Wizard</a> 20:29, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just a heads up: I've reverted your move of <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_bestiary_8b92.html" title="Final Fantasy bestiary">Final Fantasy bestiary</a> to Bestiary of creatures in the Final Fantasy series. The original naming of the article is in accordance with the naming conventions of the <a href="../../../w/p/f/WP%7EWPFF_e152.html" title="WP:WPFF"><i>Final Fantasy</i> WikiProject</a>, which chooses to disambiguate individual game titles over series title: "<a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_62cc.html" title="Final Fantasy">Final Fantasy</a>" refers to the series, whereas "<a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_%28video_game%29_7553.html" title="Final Fantasy (video game)">Final Fantasy (video game)</a>" refers to the first installment thereof. The discussion you cited in support of the move dealt specifically with articles related to <i>The Legend of Zelda</i>, and did not support the claim that "it's necessary to denote that Final Fantasy is a series," in any case: the discussion concerned two redundant categories of <i>Zelda</i> articles, and was unique to that particular situation. You are free to bring up your case in a venue where regular editors of <i>Final Fantasy</i>-related articles can weigh in on the matter (such as the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Final_Fantasy_0c21.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Final Fantasy">wikiproject talk page</a>, or <a href="../../../f/i/n/Talk%7EFinal_Fantasy_bestiary_3d17.html" title="Talk:Final Fantasy bestiary">Talk:Final Fantasy bestiary</a>). – <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeancdaug_9c50.html" title="User:Seancdaug">Sean Daugherty</a> <small><a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESeancdaug_ad69.html" title="User talk:Seancdaug">(talk)</a></small> 04:36, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, Axem. When you moved List of Kingdom Hearts terms to List of terms from the Kingdom Hearts series a couple of days ago, it looks like you left a number of <a href="../../../2/r/_/WP%7E2R_f763.html" title="WP:2R">double redirects</a> in place. I can work on fixing them, but I don't have the time right now; you may want to take a look and see about fixing what you can.

<dd>Heh, it was easier than I thought. I fixed all of the redirects that had links to them, but there a bunch of others without current links that still need to be fixed. I should get to them eventually if you don't beat me to it. =) <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> 14:32, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ha, nice of you to refer to me that way, but I probably don't deserve the title. Anyway, I will add some advice that I have found useful, since you asked:
<ul>
<li>Don't sleep</li>
<li>Don't eat</li>
<li>Research like mad. Think of it this way, before you do anything else: if you don't have sources to cite, then there's no point starting. You'll save yourself a lot of wasted time if you make sure you've got everything you need to build an article with from the beginning</li>
<li>Start with the real world sections first, such as Reception or Development. I usually start at the Reception section and then work my way through the other real world sections before finally doing the plot-related stuff. I find that it helps you keep yourself grounded in thinking in terms of applying the article's subject matter to the real world. Also, I personally think it's more interesting. For me, the hardest part of writing an article is working on the plot-related stuff. I mean, <i>I</i> already know the story. Writing about it is hardly a joyride to me, especially when it's bogged down in as many details as one like <i>Final Fantasy VII</i>'s. I personally find information about how critics responded and about what kind of ideas went into making the game a whole lot more interesting to work on</li>
<li>Do the lead last. By then, you've already done everything else, and you know exactly how the article needs to be summarized</li>
<li>Keep the process the images went through on this FAC in mind. While I, at first, was annoyed with <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a>'s extensive analysis of these things, I've begun to realize that somebody had to do it, and that it really helps ensure that the images we do use are all the more valuable for meeting some really sensible criteria, such as notability, or what they help convey that text alone might not be able to</li>
<li>Take breaks when you need them. I can't stress this enough. You don't <i>have to</i> do an entire 90-100kb article in two and a half days like I did. That was <i>nuts</i>. I don't know why I did it. I blame... I don't know who I blame. But it was nuts. Don't do that. When you start feeling burned out, walk away from it for a little while, maybe just a couple of hours. I promise you the work will benefit from it. Don't hound yourself to death, and don't force yourself to get an article to FA so fast. Normally, this process is supposed to take weeks. Sometimes it takes people months. Really, what Deckiller and I have done with all our work is unnatural. You don't have to do that. Just keep it in mind. Find the pace you work best at and just conduct yourself at that pace alone. Don't try to beat us or tie us or anything like that. You'll do your best when you're feeling comfortable. The ironic aspect of this advice I'm giving you is that, for me, I do work best under rapid conditions, for whatever reason. But find your own comfort level and stay in it</li>
<li>Get as much feedback as you can, especially from editors you trust or respect. However, try to be open to the advice of even those people who cause you to think "Where'd the hell they come from?" while making an entrance accompanied by an edit that you might not have liked. This one's hard. But it's a good idea. One of the worst things that can happen while making an article is to say something you regret. If you do it, just remember that it happens to all of us I've done it plenty of times. Always remember to apologize when it happens, though. This is very important (I won't say why. It might be important to you for a different reason than it is me, but I promise that it's important)</li>
<li>Don't be afraid to be bold when you have to be. Don't even be afraid to disregard any or all of this advice. Do what you have to do</li>
<li>Remember to thank everybody you owe a thanks to, even the people who annoyed you or altogether pissed you off. Especially if they actually managed to contribute on some level. Go out of your way to thank them if you have to. I can't stress this one enough. It's one of the most important, and is the only bit of advice I suggest never disregarding</li>
</ul>

<dd>You're welcome. You heard pretty much right. I'll still drop by to check the daily edits, probably, but I won't be making any focused effort like what we've seen lately again for a while.

<p>Well...you've smacked me good with your 3RR. You've declined the mediation request. You've done pretty much everything short of smacked me in the face with a glove (which I suspect is next). I've been <a href="../../../p/w/n/Pwn.html" title="Pwn">pwn</a>4g3d.</p>

<li>Sorry. I'm just a little off.
