<p>You're right, he's not a dog, he's a werewolf. If you check the banner you deleted, you'll see that the scope of the project was recently expanded to include all Canines, and in particular all articles contained in any of the subcategories of <a href="../../../c/a/n/Category%7ECanines_8482.html" title="Category:Canines">Category:Canines</a>. This category already included the <a href="../../../f/i/c/Category%7EFictional_werewolves_4656.html" title="Category:Fictional werewolves">Category:Fictional werewolves</a>, which contains this page. I won't try to restore the banner right away. However, I have to say in all honesty that, a few weeks or months from now, when either I or someone else goes through the category again, that that person will not restore the banner, unless the categorization is changed. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 18:33, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No one is claiming "jurisdiction" or anything like that. And, again, I was not the one who put the page in the Fictional werewolves category or that category in the Canines category, someone else did. Personally, I can't address how long the article has been there, as I only just started the classification of the other canines a few days ago. However, I would disagree with you about whether anyone would maintain it. One of the things on several of the articles is the requiring maintenance tab, which will hopefully draw an editors attention if it is used. Right now I am working on trying to tag many of the articles from the religion field, most of which have no tags despite having one or more interested Projects, so I personally probably won't be returning to Dogs for a few days. However, if the page is also added to the page <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Dogs_Articles_204f.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Dogs/Articles">Wikipedia:WikiProject Dogs/Articles</a>, then it will be monitored by any member of the project who wishes to do so, because of the inclusion on the project page of the recent changes function which brings up any changes in any of the articles on the article page. Also, the inclusion of a banner indicates to some parties where there is at least one project which is interested in their articles, thus allowing for potential collaboration, peer review, etc.. On your point regarding rethinking banners in general, you'd probably want to take that up with the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Council_9ee4.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Council">Wikipedia:WikiProject Council</a>, who created the guidelines I used when placing the banners. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 22:08, 19 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Nor was I inferring any "blame" from your comment. However, there is now also, mentioned on the Council's talk page, a bot available to check all the articles within a given category. There is also at least one member of the project, <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeesiewonder_39bb.html" title="User:Keesiewonder">Keesiewonder</a>, who seems to me has been checking up on all articles, given the number of messages from her I have received on recent changes in articles in the Canines category. Also, taking anything on a case-by-case basis, while reasonable, generally involves even more effort than trying to do anything once across the board, and raises the question as to whom would be the person qualified for making those individual decisions in a wide variety of cases. I am not disagreeing with you here, and hope that it is not taken like I am. I am simply pointing out the difficulties involved in doing as you suggest. Again, you are free to remove the banner from the article, and to even change the categorization, if you see fit. Also, I have no real objections to further changes in the banner, if that is what you think would be appropriate. However, if you wish to make changes in the way Projects in general operate, as stated before, you'd probably get the best response from the <a href="../../../c/o/u/WP%7ECOUNCIL_bae4.html" title="WP:COUNCIL">WikiProject Council</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> in particular. My reason for saying this has nothing to do with the Dogs project per se, but the fact that at some point in the future I or someone else might add another banner from an applicable project to the article, which might start the whole conversation over again, probably with someone else. It would probably be easier, if one wanted to propose changes across the board, to go to the larger number of people involved in such activities right away, and thus avoiding the delays brought about by approaching what is basically a middle-man like me. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 22:23, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree with your standpoint on this; the sentence clearly states that in [all] L. of Z. computer games, Link is left handed - this is not true, and the sentence I inserted is not only verifiable, but highly relevant to this section, as it points out that there is a notable exception to this.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To say that the section is talking about something unrelated is not a suitable reason also, as not only is this specific part of the section dealing with the left-hand topic, but is in it's present form, simply worded wrongly.</dd>

<p>Noticed that several of the Ranma ½ are getting deleted due to lack of sourcing (this is a bot delete and legit, so this is not a complaint). Now, in the incarnation they are displayed currently I can't find the source (they are apparently off the laser disc versions which are way old on the net so I can't confirm), but I know most are in Viz Video's catalog as they are used on box arts for VHS tapes, but not quite the same (background changes, overlays for the box info and such).

<p>Hi Axem. When you renamed that article (a move which I support, BTW), you broke the wikilinks in four other articles that linked to that one. Just a friendly reminder that when renaming an article, it's always a good idea to check "What links here" first, so you can update all the linked articles.

<p>Hi, you've been really busy keeping the Final Fantasy articles in good condiditon (in other words, keeping them from deteriorating too much).

<p>Why did you remove the cast list? That was a bit irritating to spend a good amount of time compiling and coding that, then having it removed with one fell swoop, especially without explanation.

<p>Hi Axem Titanium,</p>
<p>The reason I added the Virtual Console to the chronology, is because I'd say in the basis it is a re-release just like the GameBoy Advance ones. It's availability on the Virtual Console I think is no different then the availability of it on a cartridge.</p>

<p>Thanks for drawing my attention to that AfD about comic book villains. This is not meant as an accusation by any means, but some editors might consider that "vote canvassing" and use it to poison the well of the AfD itself (I see this happen a lot.) You might want to be a bit more cautious about that in the future, or use more neutral language.

<dd>You know, I truly don't know how it works.

<p>Seems you nominated a bunch of Final Fantasy merge redirects as CSD R3. If there's a bunch of previous content (especially one that has been merged before), you <i>really</i> should take them to RfD or AfD instead. CSD R3 is really meant for "oops, I misspelled the title" kind of situations; we'll run into GFDL issues and potentially losing authorship information if we use it any other way. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 00:14, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>As for history merges - um, firstly, it'd add a huge burden on admins, and secondly, that'd create one heckball of confusing history on the articles. If you merge histories of two articles, you get an interleaved history: Pages A and B may end up like A version 1, B version 1, B version 2, A version 2, A version 3, etc... it completely messes up diffs and stuff. No, I'd not recommend it. The system was <i>meant</i> to work as it is, keeping the merged content in its original location. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 00:20, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Few suggestions from a fellow copy-editor: the kingdom hearts voice actors should remain, because a lot of these characters no longer have individual articles, so it's not very excessive. Also, some of the excess wording was added intentionally by me to avoid appearences of original research (such as the mirror image synthesis, which may be interpreted as OR by certain wikilawyer nazis). I'll go ahead and restore those instances, and give a followup copy-edit. Nice work on the whole.

<p>I'm not extremely concerned with the issue, although I feel the colons are more professional and common. I also know that a lot of Japanese games include random hyphens around words or phrases (usually major definitions, such as the -Contact- from Xenogears), so that might be another case against it. Afterall, we are the English Wikipedia. Nevertheless, it's not a major concern to me, and I don't mind it to the extent that I'll devote significant time and energy into the debate. — <b><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_96c6.html" title="User:Deckiller">Deckill</a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User_talk%7EDeckiller_aecd.html" title="User talk:Deckiller">er</a></b> 22:17, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Most likely, because it helps clarify the title to our readers. When we look at the packaging, there is a clear line break, and it seems the hyphens are (or would be) used for stylistic reasons.
