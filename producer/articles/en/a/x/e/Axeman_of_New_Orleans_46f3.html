	    <p><b>The Axeman of New Orleans</b> was a <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serial_killer.html" title="Serial killer">serial killer</a> active in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Orleans_615c.html" title="New Orleans">New Orleans</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisiana.html" title="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> (and surrounding communities, including <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gretna%2C_Louisiana_2252.html" title="Gretna, Louisiana">Gretna, Louisiana</a>), from May <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a> to October <a href="../../../1/9/1/1919.html" title="1919">1919</a>. Press reports during the height of public panic about the killings mentioned similar murders as early as <a href="../../../1/9/1/1911.html" title="1911">1911</a>, but recent researchers have called these reports into question.</p>
<p>As the killer's <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudonym.html" title="Pseudonym">pseudonym</a> implies, the victims were attacked with an <a href="../../../a/x/e/Axe.html" title="Axe">axe</a>. In some of the crimes, the doors to the victim's homes were first bashed open with the same tool. "The Axeman" was not caught or identified at the time, although his crime spree stopped as mysteriously as it started. The murderer's identity remains unknown to this day, although various possible identifications of varying plausibility have been proposed.</p>
<p>Not all of the Axeman's victims died, but the savagery and utter randomness of his attacks terrorized much of the populace. Some early victims were <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_American_4105.html" title="Italian American">Italian American</a>, in particular the son of Pietro Pepitone who had killed <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Hand_%28blackmail%29_8f5c.html" title="Black Hand (blackmail)">Black Hand</a> extortionist Paul Di Christina (Paulo Marchese) several years before, leading the newspapers to assume the killings were somehow <a href="../../../m/a/f/Mafia.html" title="Mafia">Mafia</a> related (similar to Chicago's Black Hand assassin "<a href="../../../s/h/o/Shotgun_Man_386c.html" title="Shotgun Man">Shotgun Man</a>"). However later crimes clearly did not fit this profile, and the apprehension of the general public grew. His victims included a pregnant woman and even a baby killed in the arms of its mother. The Axeman also seemed to draw direct inspiration from <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_the_Ripper_b953.html" title="Jack the Ripper">Jack the Ripper</a>: he (or someone claiming to be the Axeman) wrote taunting letters to city newspapers hinting at his future crimes and claiming to be a supernatural <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demon.html" title="Demon">demon</a> "from <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hell.html" title="Hell">Hell</a>."</p>
<p>Most notoriously, on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_13.html" title="March 13">March 13</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1919.html" title="1919">1919</a>, a letter purporting to be from the Axeman was published in the newspapers saying that he would kill again at 15 minutes past midnight on the night of <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_19.html" title="March 19">March 19</a>, but would spare the occupants of any place where a <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz.html" title="Jazz">jazz</a> band was playing. That night all of New Orleans's dance halls were filled to capacity, and professional and amateur bands played jazz at parties at hundreds of houses around town. There were no murders that night.</p>
<p>Not everyone was intimidated by the Axeman. Some <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firearm.html" title="Firearm">well armed</a> citizens sent the newspaper invitations for the Axeman to visit their houses that night and see who got killed first. One invitation promised to leave a window open for the Axeman, politely asking that he not damage the front door.</p>
<p>Crime writer <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colin_Wilson_4436.html" title="Colin Wilson">Colin Wilson</a> speculates the Axeman could have been Joseph Momfre, a man shot to death in Los Angeles in <a href="../../../d/e/c/December.html" title="December">December</a>,<a href="../../../1/9/2/1920.html" title="1920">1920</a> by the widow of Mike Pepitone, the Axeman's last known victim. Pepitone's widow, who served only three years for the killing, claimed to recognize Momfre as the man she saw fleeing her home the night she discovered her husband's body. Wilson notes that Momfre was in jail during all of the Axeman's "dormant" periods (including the period from <a href="../../../1/9/1/1912.html" title="1912">1912</a>-1918), and free at all times the Axeman struck.</p>
<p>One of the alleged "early" victims of the Axeman, an Italian couple named Schiambra were shot by an intruder in their <a href="../../../l/o/w/Lower_Ninth_Ward_b0c7.html" title="Lower Ninth Ward">Lower Ninth Ward</a> home in the early morning hours of <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_16.html" title="May 16">May 16</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1912.html" title="1912">1912</a>. The male Schiambra survived while his wife died. In newspaper accounts, the prime suspect is referred to by the name of "Momfre" more than once. While radically different than the Axeman's usual MO, if Joseph Momfre was indeed the Axeman, the Schiambra's may well have been an early victim of the future serial killer.</p>

<p>- <b>Joseph Maggio</b> was an Italian grocer who was attacked while sleeping alongside his wife Catherine at his home on the corner of Upperline and Magnolia Streets on the night of May 22, 1918. He survived the initial attack, but died minutes after being discovered by his brothers Jake and Andrew, who lived next door and had come to investigate after hearing his groans.</p>
<p>- <b>Catherine Maggio</b> was the wife of Joseph Maggio. She was attacked during the night along with her husband on the night of May 22, 1918. She suffered numerous blows to the head via an axe and her throat had been cut so deep that her neck was nearly completely severed.</p>
<p>- <b>Louis Besumer</b> , also a grocer, was attacked in the early morning hours of June 6, 1918, alongside his mistress Anna Lowe. He was critically wounded in the attack but managed to survive.</p>
<p>- <b>Anna Lowe</b> was killed while in bed with Louis Besumer. She had been badly wounded and died a few hours later at <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charity_Hospital_d157.html" title="Charity Hospital">Charity Hospital</a>.</p>
<p>- <b>Mrs. Schneider</b> was attacked in the early evening hours of August 5, 1918. The 8 months pregnant Schneider awoke to find a dark figure standing over her and she was bashed in the face repeadedly with an axe. She was discovered later when her husband returned from work. She was treated for her wounds at Charity Hospital and delivered a healthy baby girl 3 weeks after the attack.</p>
<p>- <b>Joseph Romano</b> was an elderly man living with his two nieces, Pauline and Mary Bruno. On August 10, 1918, Pauline awoke to find a man standing over her. She screamed and the man leaped off into the night. She entered her uncle's room to find him critically injured. With Romano's dying breath, he instructed his niece to call the hospital.</p>
<p>- <b>Charles Cortimiglia</b> was an immigrant who lived with his wife and baby on the corner of Jefferson Avenue and Second Street in <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gretna%2C_Louisiana_2252.html" title="Gretna, Louisiana">Gretna, Louisiana</a>, a New Orleans suburb. On the night of March 10, 1919, screams were heard coming from the Cortimiglia Residence. Neighbors rushed in to find Rosie Cortimiglia kneeling on the floor in a pool of blood next to her husband, who had a gaping hole in his torso.</p>
<p>- <b>Rosie Cortimiglia</b> was the wife of immigrant laborer Charles Cortimiglia. She was attacked alongside her husband on March 10, 1919 while sleeping with her baby in her arms. She was badly wounded by the axeman, but survived the incident.</p>
<p>- <b>Mary Cortimiglia</b> was the two-year-old daughter of Charles and Rosie Cortimiglia. She was killed while sleeping in her mothers arms with a single blow to the back of the neck when she and her parents were attacked on March 10, 1919.</p>
<p>- <b>Steve Boca</b> was a grocer who was attacked in his bedroom as he slept by an axe-wielding intruder on August 10, 1919. Boca survived his wounds. It was duly noted that the assailant chisled his way through the back door, similar to other Axeman attacks.</p>
<p>- <b>Sarah Laumann</b> was attacked on the night of September 3, 1919. The 19-year-old suffered numerous head wounds and died at the hospital. This is the most mysterious of all of the crimes because Laumann was the only one in the house at the time and there were no witnesses.</p>
<p>- <b>Mike Pepitone</b> was killed on the night of October 27, 1919. His wife was awakened by a noise and arrived at the door of his bedroom just as a large axe-wielding man was rushing out of it (some accounts say she saw <i>two</i> men fleeing her husband's room.) Pepitone was transported to Charity Hospital where he died early the next morning.</p>

<p>In 1919 local tune writer Joseph John Davilla wrote the song "The Mysterious Axeman's Jazz (Don't Scare Me Papa)". Published by New Orleans based World's Music Publishing Company, the cover depicted a family playing music with frightened looks on their faces.</p>
<p>The 1945 book <i>Gumbo Ya-Ya, A Collection of Louisiana Folk Tales</i> includes a chapter on the Axeman entitled "Axeman's Jazz", which helped spark renewed interest in the murders. The book also reproduced the cover of the 1919 sheet music.</p>
<p>Writer <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julie_Smith_af62.html" title="Julie Smith">Julie Smith</a> used a fictionalized version of the Axeman events in her 1991 <a href="../../../n/o/v/Novel.html" title="Novel">novel</a> <i>The Axeman's Jazz</i>.</p>
<p>The Axeman killings are also referred to in the short story "Mussolini and the Axeman's Jazz" by <a href="../../../p/o/p/Poppy_Z._Brite_c708.html" title="Poppy Z. Brite">Poppy Z. Brite</a>, published in 1997.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuck_Palahniuk_0b15.html" title="Chuck Palahniuk">Chuck Palahniuk</a>'s 2005 novel <i><a href="../../../h/a/u/Haunted_%28novel%29.html" title="Haunted (novel)">Haunted</a></i>, the Axeman is mentioned in Sister Vigilante's short story.</p>
