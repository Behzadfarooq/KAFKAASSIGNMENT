<p>In the Advance universe, Axel Almer (if chosen as the main character) suffers from amnesia. He quests for his memory, fighting alongside Londo Bell, yet fearful of the truths that will be revealed once it has been restored. He is easy-going and gets along with the Londo Bell crew rather well, trading jokes with the men and flirting with, and getting turned down by, the women. Also a bit of an idiot, earning him the nickname "Ahoseru" (アホセル) from fans of the game, particularly on <a href="../../../2/c/h/2channel.html" title="2channel">2channel</a>'s robot game board.</p>
<p>However, when not chosen as the main character, Axel's personality changes considerably, becoming a cold-hearted soldier who puts his missions before anything else.</p>
<p>In the Original Generation universe, Axel's personality changes yet again. This time, he is a man driven by only one goal – the defeat of <a href="../../../k/y/o/Kyosuke_Nanbu_9938.html" title="Kyosuke Nanbu">Beowulf</a>. He cares little for others, except if they will serve his purposes. He will deviate from mission parameters for the chance to engage his archenemy. He also harbors a dislike for artificial lifeforms resembling humans, such as the W-Series androids, particularly W17, <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lamia_Loveless_5171.html" title="Lamia Loveless">Lamia Loveless</a>. Though he did show some contempt for Lamia in Advance, this is made even worse in Original Generation 2 (in fact, even though many lines in Original Generation 2 are simply copied and pasted from older games, the staff actually took the time to rewrite some of Axel's old lines to make him seem more arrogant and even more disdainful of Lamia).</p>

<p>In the Advance universe, if the player chooses to use a <a href="../../../r/e/a/Real_robot.html" title="Real robot">real robot</a> for Axel to use, his story begins while waking up in the chosen unit, with the remains of a robot battle around him. His machine is slightly damaged, has some of its ammunition and energy stores used up, and is alone amidst all the destruction. He wonders if there are any other survivors, and why he can’t remember anything, save his name. As he surveys the area, he is swiftly caught up in a battle between the three stolen <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal_Armor_Dragonar_98df.html" title="Metal Armor Dragonar">Dragonar</a> units and the Giganos team pursuing them. After being aided by the Londo Bell flagship, the <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argama.html" title="Argama">Argama</a>, Axel and the Dragonar pilots were drafted into the force.</p>
<p>If the player chooses to use a <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_robot.html" title="Super robot">super robot</a> for Axel to use, his story begins when <a href="../../../s/a/y/Sayaka_Yumi_c884.html" title="Sayaka Yumi">Sayaka Yumi</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boss_%28Mazinger%29_f427.html" title="Boss (Mazinger)">Boss Borot</a> of <a href="../../../m/a/z/Mazinger_Z_93f6.html" title="Mazinger Z">Mazinger Z</a> were out on patrol when they notice an object fall from the sky. Upon investigation, they discover that it is a humanoid robot, and that the pilot has amnesia. As they interrogate the pilot, who can only remember his name as Axel Almer, Ankoku Daishogun’s forces arrive and decide to capture the unknown robot. This leads into a battle, with <a href="../../../k/o/u/Kouji_Kabuto_3b0f.html" title="Kouji Kabuto">Kouji Kabuto</a> in the Mazinger Z, Tetsuya Tsurugi in the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Mazinger_0052.html" title="Great Mazinger">Great Mazinger</a>, and Jun Hono in <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diana_A_3a1b.html" title="Diana A">Diana A</a> arriving to help. Axel wonders why he can pilot and fight effectively, and the Mazinger team suggests heading to the Photonic Labs to try and get some answers. Now an <i>adopted</i> member of the Mazinger team, Axel goes with them when their might is needed to protect Earth.</p>
<p>Axel is disconcerted after an encounter with a woman calling herself W17, who addressed him as a ranking officer. He still has no idea who he really is; all he knows is he’s fighting for what he believes is the side of good. After encountering Vindel Mauser and his Zweizergain, it all returns to him: he is a high ranking officer of the Shadow-Mirror, and volunteered to do a dimensional jump and scout this dimension’s defenders and rival factions, as a precursor to the Shadow-Mirror invasion. His amnesia was due to a mishap during the jump – thus, he has been fighting alongside his "enemies" all along, for which Vindel praises his ability to function as a sleeper agent.</p>
<p>Later on, when Vindel calls upon Axel to reveal his identity. Axel does so, informing Londo Bell of the Shadow-Mirror's plans in the process. He then self-detonates his unit, severely damaging the Zweizergain and vanishes in the explosion. He is later revealed to have been retrieved by <a href="../../../l/e/m/Lemon_Browning_9a5c.html" title="Lemon Browning">Lemon Browning</a>, Vindel's second-in-command, who asks him who he is really fighting for, and who is right in this war. Lemon then lets him free, saying the next time they meet it will be as enemies, as there is no turning back. Axel rejoins Londo Bell, telling them that they’re welcome to shoot him in the back if they choose to, but he’d rather fight alongside them again. After defeating Vindel’s forces, he activates the dimension transposition bomb by using the Zweizergain, in an attempt to stop Axis from falling onto the Earth.</p>
<p>Some time later, there is much ado over a space-time disturbance in a region of space – it seems to be an event that the various Londo Bell-affiliated laboratories and agencies have been waiting to occur. In deep space, Axel reappears, his unit badly damaged and with only limited oxygen, musing how he survived only to die from lack of breathable air. Just as he resigns himself to joining Lemon, the members of Londo Bell converge on his location. After being rebuked by his friends for not deciding to see the effects of his deeds, Axel decides to live and face what the future will bring.</p>
<p>In the Original Generation universe, Axel appears in the prologue, conversing with Lemon as to how the transposition is proceeding, with Lemon replying that everything is proceeding as best as possible under the circumstances. It appears the Shadow-Mirror are on the move, yet a last ditch effort by an Earth Federation elite <a href="../../../g/e/s/Gespenst.html" title="Gespenst">Gespenst</a> squad could throw things off. Axel orders all remaining soldiers, including Lemon, into the portal – not as an act of valor, but because he wants to have a deciding match with the squad leader, Beowulf, who pilots a blue Gespenst MK III. Lemon steps through the portal, and Axel launches his Soulgain at Beowulf’s machine and its squad of MK IIs.</p>
<p>Axel manages to jump dimensions, but arrives at a different time, <i>earlier</i> than his comrades who went first. Imagery of his Soulgain fighting against <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balmarian.html" title="Balmarian">Aerogater</a> forces have been found in the Earth Federation Army data banks, under the codename, <i>White Wraith</i>, right before Operation SRW, and upon rejoining his Shadow-Mirror comrades with a battered Soulgain, he explained his delay as having to recover from various injuries sustained. Later, the <a href="../../../a/t/x/ATX_Team_8012.html" title="ATX Team">ATX Team</a> encounters the Soulgain. Axel recognizes its team commander, <a href="../../../k/y/o/Kyosuke_Nanbu_9938.html" title="Kyosuke Nanbu">Kyosuke Nanbu’s</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alt_Eisen_f2ed.html" title="Alt Eisen">Alt Eisen</a>, a Gespenst MK III, only in this dimension, it is painted red. Seeing it renews Axel’s resolution to defeat his nemesis, which he had not been able to do in his home dimension. On the other hand, Kyosuke has no idea who this new enemy is, something which Axel refuses to believe.</p>
<p>Axel carries on his vendetta against Beowulf, this time in the form of Kyosuke, and this serves as a catalyst for the story's events. During a crucial mission, Axel severely damages the Alt Eisen, ripping its limbs off and was about to destroy the torso (killing Kyosuke who was still trapped inside the cockpit), but is foiled by the arrival of the Einst, led by Alfimi. Axel makes a last stand inside the Balmar White Star, ultimately falling under the combined might of Earth's defenders. <a href="../../../e/x/c/Excellen_Browning_41e7.html" title="Excellen Browning">Excellen Browning</a> tries to convince him to join their side, but both Axel and Kyosuke refuse, for once agreeing on the same thing - the loser of their so-called bet forfeits his life.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/x/e/Axel_Almer_87cf.html" title="Edit section: Trivia">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Trivia</span></h2>
<p>The voice actors for Kyosuke Nanbu (<a href="../../../t/o/s/Toshiyuki_Morikawa_2ffe.html" title="Toshiyuki Morikawa">Toshiyuki Morikawa</a>) and Axel Almer (Nobutoshi Kanna) also play rivals/arch-enemies in <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berserk.html" title="Berserk">Berserk</a>.</p>
<p>There have been questions raised about the romanization of his surname. Since the characters associated with him have gun-related surnames (Lemon <b>Browning</b>, Vindel <b>Mauser</b>, Kyosuke Nanbu/<b>Nambu</b>), it has been put up that his last name is Arma, a play on <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armalite.html" title="Armalite">ArmaLite</a>, maker of the M4 and M16 assault rifles.</p>
<p>The names Almar, Almer, and Arma are written using the same katakana. The confusion stems from the "マー" part, which is traditionally romanized as "mar" or "mer."</p>
