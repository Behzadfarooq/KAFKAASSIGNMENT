<p>Hi Axel. Sorry if you don't wat this here but I really wanted to compliment you on what you did on those pages above, especially on Goedel's Theorem. Very good work! -- JanHidders</p>
<hr />
<p>Thanks for the kind words! I'm enjoying myself tremendously here and have learned a lot already&#160;:-) --Axel</p>
<hr />
<p>Hello, I love your page. Yours is the first page I've read where I and the author are in complete agreement on almost everything. Remarkable. <a href="../../../k/o/y/User%7EKoyaanis_Qatsi_7ab5.html" title="User:Koyaanis Qatsi">--KQ</a></p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Hey KQ, do you mean my home page?? Because I have never met anybody who is in almost complete agreement with that. --Axel</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Yes, I do. Specifically, I was referring to politics.html, though the rest is interesting too. I disagree about the prostitution argument, though, simply because people could also give food away for free out of love or charity, though I do agree that prostitution should be legal. And I must admit to having violated a few of your rules on webdesigning.... --KQ</p>
<hr />
<p>Regarding recycling (your home page): among green types, recycling is recognized as the least desirable choice of the reduce/reuse/recycle trio. Reduce being to reduce what you use, reuse being to use something for the same purpose more than once (standard plates vs. paper plates, for example), and recycle being, as you put it, "downcycling." I collect aluminum for recycling in my office, but I don't buy or bring aluminum cans to the office myself. --<a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBelltower_4989.html" title="User:Belltower">Belltower</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Dear Axel,</p>
<p>Upon checking upon KQ comment, curiosity led me to your page, and then to <a href="http://math-www.uni-paderborn.de/~axel/politics.html" class="external free" title="http://math-www.uni-paderborn.de/~axel/politics.html" rel="nofollow">http://math-www.uni-paderborn.de/~axel/politics.html</a> You are a brainy guy! But your statement "<a href="../../../m/e/d/Medical_research.html" title="Medical research">Medical research</a> is a tremendous waste of time and money" is just plain stunning! I never thought I would ever hear anything like this -- hence "stunning". I also want people in <a href="../../../n/i/g/Niger.html" title="Niger">Niger</a> to overcome <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illiteracy.html" title="Illiteracy">illiteracy</a>, overcome <a href="../../../p/o/v/Poverty.html" title="Poverty">poverty</a>, and have access to the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a>. However, it would be wiser to speak about wrong allocation of resources or wrong priorities. Calling the work of thousands of good people and <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genius.html" title="Genius">geniuses</a> a waste of time and money is very unjust. The same research that serves a rich guy in Miami today can lead to a cure for <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaria.html" title="Malaria">malaria</a> tomorrow and save millions of lives (I hope you care).</p>
<p>For balance, I subscribe to your ideas of "kid simulating the universe", "marriage is outdated", "marrying into the developing world", and "let's have global government" (this is quite obvious to many and we will get there one day).</p>
<p>However, I found your views surprising, contradictory or plain erroneous in several places. To be sure, I would first need to know what are your basic beliefs because the call to "sit still and retire early" once again proves to me how astoundingly different people walk this planet. Of further disagreements: give passports to Kosovars (I agree but ... what about those who want to get back home, what about Slobodan and justice, what about the principle of not rewarding aggression?), no breeding (if brainy people stop breeding, all your calls to change will lay in ruin -- you know why!), few links in HTML (this is against wikipedia, against your own writings on wikipedia, and against the principle that it is less harm to make a hesitant guy hesitate than to deprive a resolute guy of a choice to be informed), war on advertising (let advertisers bleed their money down the drain, read Seth Godin!), bogus e-mail (not only you fool spammers but you mess up web traffic and search engines -- why pollute to resolve pollution), web overhyped (perhaps for guys who want to "sit still", my life goes through a new renascence thanks to this knowledge goldmine), comments on <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Duesberg_a1b6.html" title="Peter Duesberg">Peter Duesberg</a> and his "science" (prompted me to write an entry on Duesberg -- follow the <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Duesberg_a1b6.html" title="Peter Duesberg">link</a>), and last but not least ... lots of people/companies make pretty money on the net and this is only gonna grow!</p>
<p>I am sure you will want to know if except for "agree" or "disagree" I was inspired. Yes, this was all put in a way that tickles "creativity centers" (I won't list them due to your dislike of medical research). The best was the idea of swapping citizenship. I never thought of it. On the top of my head, it would not work (5 million of Sierra Leoneans waiting for 3 US vacancies), but I will leave it in my memory for further processing.</p>
<p><br />
btw: Why do you want no development ("sit still, retire early")? If you sit still in stagnation, how will you contact the kid that runs this universe in a computer simulation? How old are you? If you are below 27.3, your future is bright&#160;:) -- <a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotr_Wozniak_aa38.html" title="User:Piotr Wozniak">Piotr Wozniak</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Piotr, I'm glad if I stimulated you; some of the "radical" statements on that page are actually intended to do just that. For instance, the "medical research is a waste of time and money" statement is intended to shock you into realizing how appallingly partial we are when it comes to applying the fruits of that research. And the "sit and retire" recommendation is supposed to point to the fact that much of our so-called activity is actually detrimental.</p>
<p>I also should say that this page has been created over 6 years and that I myself don't agree with all of it anymore&#160;:-)</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<pre>

<hr />
<p>Aha! Still the "shock method" on medical research may backfire as one could be tempted to think "crackpot page" and click on close button in the browser. I was lucky to dig deeper :) - Is your age a secret? (btw: I am 40) There must be some page on the net which is the focus of those wanting a global government!

<p>Actually, the problem with advertising isn't that they're wasting money, but that it actually does work! We aren't quite the rational creatures we would like to believe, so advertisers can convince us we need a V-8 engine, to spend thousands on a diamond that 99% of us couldn't tell from cubic zirconium, and (worse) they convince our kids that they absolutely must have various and sundry kitschy items. By bombarding us with images of beautiful people and scenes, it alters our perceptions of the world around us. If advertising were just a way to inform us about new and potentially useful products, that would be one thing. But it's another, far more harmful thing. -- <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBelltower_4989.html" title="User:Belltower">Belltower</a></p>

<p>Hi Axel--I have neglected to welcome folks since the latest Slashdotting, but you're clearly one of the most active and a very valuable member of the crew. Thanks for joining us. --<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarry_Sanger_6200.html" title="User:Larry Sanger">Larry Sanger</a></p>
<p>Hi, and thank you for letting me play here. Yes, I'm one of the Slashdotters, but now I like it here a lot better :-) Larry, I thought you may like <a href="../../../g/o/e/Goedels_ontological_proof.html" title="Goedels ontological proof">this</a>. --Axel</p>

<p>I'm glad to see the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Four_color_theorem.html" title="Four color theorem">four color theorem</a>. A few weeks back I was tagging merchandise in different colors to correspond to different sections; we had tags in three colors and that sometimes resulted in corners where two different sections were tagged the same color, which set me off wondering if it were possible to avoid the problem with only three colors, or if not, how many would have to be used. And what do you know, that's a problem which had been vexing people for over 100 years, and solved in 1977. I'm glad I didn't waste my time trying to reinvent the wheel.  :-) --<a href="../../../k/o/y/User%7EKoyaanis_Qatsi_7ab5.html" title="User:Koyaanis Qatsi">Koyaanis Qatsi</a></p>

<p>Yes, my April's fool page about Udo von Aachen can be removed. But perhaps it would be best to update it to be a page about the hoax.

<p>Axel,</p>
<p>I just came across this <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_Domain_Resources_Foldoc_license_97a2.html" title="Public Domain Resources/Foldoc license">email snippet</a> between you and you and Denis Howe (the editor of FOLDOC). Any word on him wanting to merge FOLDOC with Wikipedia?</p>
<p>For now, and as my time permits, I'll be moving content over and editting as necessay. I mean, just compare our <a href="../../../t/e/x/TeX_cfe6.html" title="TeX">TeX</a> article with <a href="http://foldoc.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?query=TeX" class="external text" title="http://foldoc.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?query=TeX" rel="nofollow">his</a>... So finally, I just wanted to thank you for your work in securing permission to use FOLDOC and also the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_computing.html" title="History of computing">History of computing</a> material. It's really good stuff. -- <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Gilbert_b934.html" title="User:Stephen Gilbert">Stephen Gilbert</a></p>
<p>My understanding is that Denis will work on his own wiki-like interface to Foldoc for now and will not join our project at this point. But he is happy to have us use his material. --AxelBoldt</p>

<p>Axel - thanks for the <a href="../../../l/i/t/Literate_programming.html" title="Literate programming">literate programming</a> article - an area I'm starting to explore.

<p>Axel - could you have a look at <a href="../../../f/u/n/Functional_analysis.html" title="Functional analysis">Functional analysis</a>? It's so incomprehensible (and I did some second and third-year college mathematics, though I'm certainly no expert) that I'm just about wondering whether it's actual mathematics or just some pseudoscience somebody's deliberately slipped into Wikipedia to test whether it would be detected . . . and even if it's not, it could use some serious revision to be comprehensible (at least at a hand-waving level if not at a technical level) by lesser mortals --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Merkel_dd17.html" title="User:Robert Merkel">Robert Merkel</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Cool, you've just done so. It's now at least semi-readable . . .</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>Axel - You are spot on with the big mess over in tensors. It *is* a very messy topic because of the large amount of baggage in train. Hopefully, someone such as yourself can dig into the math part and make it slightly more accessible. Others (maybe me) can handle the engineering side of it. And by the way, one very well-respected, though now dated, continuum mechanics simply states a matrix is a tensor if it changes coordinates the way tensors are supposed to. I might add that this text is in current use as an entry level graduate text at berkeley civil eng. this semester... =) In its favor, the author uses 3 different notations in the book: indicial, index free, and gibbs dyadic (whoa!).</p>
<hr />
<p>Axel - I've added a few examples to WikiProject Concepts. I'd be interested in knowing what you think about it, as a mathematician. Do you believe that it can help structure the encyclopedia? --<a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESeb_8aa8.html" title="User:Seb">Seb</a></p>
<p>Seb: frankly, I don't see the point of the wpc hierarchy. Every well-written encyclopedia article about a concept should include generalizations and specializations anyway, and most math articles do already. So you are basically building a concept hierarchy parallel to the one of Wikipedia, except yours has a more formalized format and less information. --AxelBoldt</p>
<p>Axel - So what you're saying, basically, is that you don't see how having access to a well-defined structure might make navigation or edition easier? --Seb</p>
<p>In fact, it may make navigation more difficult. Suppose someone wants to find out about formal languages. They type it into the search box, and two articles show up: Wikipedia's and Wpc's. Which one to pick? If they pick Wpc's, they learn that a formal language is a kind of set, involves strings, read the definition and learn about several kinds of formal languages. The same information, and much more, is also contained in Wikipedia's article. So how does Wpc help? I think it would be more useful to make sure that all Wikipedia articles about concepts correctly link to their generalizations and specializations. --AxelBoldt</p>

<hr />
<p>Axel, it seems to me a <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relative_prime.html" title="Relative prime">relative prime</a> would be a better title than <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relatively_prime.html" title="Relatively prime">relatively prime</a>. --<a href="../../../d/m/e/User%7EDmerrill_3f6c.html" title="User:Dmerrill">Dmerrill</a></p>
<p>No, because "relatively prime" is an adjective, there is no such thing as a prime that is "relative". --AxelBoldt</p>

<p>Hey Axel... I see a <a href="../../../t/e/s/Tesseract.html" title="Tesseract">tesseract</a> article. Are there fifth dimensional objects too? Add one if you wish. We need to teach Larry there are more than 3 D's. ~BF</p>
<p>Sure there are fifth dimensional objects. There are also infinite dimensional objects. Every little electron in your body is described by an infinite dimensional object. There's also not just one infinity. There is a hierarchy of infinitely many different infinitudes.

<p>Dr. Bolt I went to your .de homepage. Isla Vista is nice isn't it ? I have a question. Hypothetically speaking, if we raised c to the c power <b>c <sup>|c|</sup></b> would we have a number expressing light accelerating at light speed ? <a href="../../../b/f/_/User%7EBF_5b31.html" title="User:BF">BF</a></p>
<p>No we wouldn't. Something "accelerating at light speed" doesn't make sense: speed has the units meters per second (or miles per hour), while acceleration has the units meters per second per second or miles per hour per hour: it tells you how much the <i>speed</i> changes per hour.</p>
<p>Yes, Isla Vista is fun. I particularly miss the drunken Mexicans who would give me a ride home to downtown SB late at night when I had missed the last bus. --AxelBoldt</p>

I can't really put this under <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_articles_7c5b.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested articles">Requested articles</a> because I don't exactly know what I'm requesting :).

<dd>Ok, I have an Opera version of the bookmarklet on <a href="http://math-www.uni-paderborn.de/~axel/bookmarklet.html" class="external free" title="http://math-www.uni-paderborn.de/~axel/bookmarklet.html" rel="nofollow">http://math-www.uni-paderborn.de/~axel/bookmarklet.html</a>. It doesn't do the selection thing since Opera doesn't seem to support the relevant Javascript method, but you can still type or paste in Wikipedia search terms and you'll get a new window with the results. --AxelBoldt</dd>
</dl>
<p>It works great. Does Javascript have a method to grab the contents of the clipboard? If so, it would be possible to highlight the term, hit CTRL-C, then hit the bookmarklet. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Gilbert_b934.html" title="User:Stephen Gilbert">Stephen Gilbert</a></p>
<p>It's always a matter of which methods the browser exports to javascript. Javascript itself doesn't have any way to access the clipboard, or the selection, or a window. It's all provided by the browser, and different browsers provide different things. I doubt that Opera provides access to the clipboard, since access to the selection is more direct and not included in Opera. --AxelBoldt</p>

<p>Hi Axel, I find some of the articles you have written or contributed to ver y interesting. Unfortunately, I cannot understand them -- specifically, in the article on Goedel's theorum, and a linked article on a consistent and complete system of arithmatic, I do not understand</p>
<dl>
<dd>? x : ? (0 = x + 1)</dd>
</dl>
<p>and what follows. I am neither a philosopher nor a mathematician, but would like to read articles on these topics. If there is an article in Wikipedia on how to read this system of notation (including a box which I don't think copied in this cut and paste), could you insert links to it in these articles? If there isn't such an article, perhaps you or someone else could write one? I am sure others would be as grateful as I -- SR</p>
<p>I'm not sure about what you don't understand; since you referred to a box, that may mean that a certain mathematical symbol didn't render correctly in your browser, and then of course everything that follows will be incomprehensible as well. But the Goedel article <a href="../../../g/%C3%B6/d/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorem.html" title="Gödel's incompleteness theorem">Gödel's incompleteness theorem</a> doesn't have any symbols. So let me know what specifically is unclear in that article.</p>
<p><br />
<a href="../../../p/r/e/Presburger_arithmetic.html" title="Presburger arithmetic">Presburger arithmetic</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/r/First-order_predicate_calculus.html" title="First-order predicate calculus">First-order predicate calculus</a> have indeed several symbols that some browsers don't understand: the quantifiers. The "for all" quantifier looks like an A on its head, and the "exists" quantifier looks like a mirror E. They are valid HTML 4.0 symbols, but unfortunately, that doesn't mean much. If you look at the source of the page, you should be able to figure out what the equations mean. --AxelBoldt</p>

Hi Axel, I was thinking of emailing you this, but maybe this is a better place. Do you have a list of good books that really allows one to understand many topics in CS? For example, reading SICP, it is clear that I can't predict things. I know a bit about computers to the gate level, so it was not hard to understand Knuth's TAOCP. But with different computational models like lambda calculus, I have little idea of what is underneath.</p>
<p>Are there any such books I can read? I am not near an English-speaking university (I'm in Germany) but I can order books. I don't even mind if they're things like Spivak's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0914098896/104-4250063-7245525" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0914098896/104-4250063-7245525" rel="nofollow">calculus</a>, if analysis is important to the field.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help, Tj</p>
<dl>
<dd>If you have read and understood Knuth's books, then you know more algorithms than most computer scientists. So if you are mainly interested in the theoretical concepts now, I'd recommend Hopcroft and Ullman, <i>Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation</i>. Every university has that book. There is a German translation too, but I think it is buggy. --AxelBoldt</dd>

<p>Axel, I did not replace <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_education.html" title="Sex education">sex education</a> with a completely differet article. If you'll take the time to read it, you will see that it is indeed incremental.</p>
<p>Please do not revert someone's changes simply because you disagree. Follow SR's example and your own advice, and make incremental changes.</p>
<p>--Ed Poor</p>
<p>I did read the article. For example, why did you remove the definition of "sex education" in the first sentence and replace it with your nonsensical "Sex education is a controversial issue in public education"? Wouldn't it make sense to tell people first what sex education is? Obviously, you hadn't even looked at the definition, you simply pasted in your version. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a></p>

<p>Hi Axel, thanks for your time on my old pages. You probably noticed that i already listed them on "wikipedia pages to be deleted", but thanks anyway :) <a href="../../../s/z/o/User%7ESzopen_9055.html" title="User:Szopen">szopen</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Hi Axel, I will try to be diplomatic and respectful of others, but I have a concern with regard to contributing to an <i>encyclopedia</i> where someone like Ed Poor continues to inject articles with his own judgements. His pages written from <b>NPOV</b> are hardly that. I have no problem with describing a subject and that linking from the subject commentaries on it pro or against, but I do have a problem with the main article being littered with judgements one way or the other. One need not pass judgements on homosexuals, sex education, etc to write out what the topic is. I also think that it is completely appropriate to provide a link to a commentary regarding the topic in question. Is this too much to ask for? I realize that I have just started to contribute and I very much like the idea of wikipedia, but I don't want to continue if this is to be turned into a forum for someone or some group trying to push their own agenda.</p>
<dl>
<dd>If you find an article which tries to push a particular point of view, just go in and edit it, clarifying that such and such is a point of view typically held by such and such group, and also explain the view of the others. This can work pretty well, check out for example <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion.html" title="Abortion">abortion</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">scientology</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The most important thing is to be bold; if you honestly believe that your change improves the article, then make it, don't shy away because you are too modest to modify somebody else's writings. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a></dd>

<p>Good catch on <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay-bashing.html" title="Gay-bashing">gay-bashing</a>. I gather if the assailant is unaware of or unconcerned with the <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_orientation.html" title="Sexual orientation">sexual orientation</a> of a homosexual victim, then the term does not apply. <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">User:Ed Poor</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Yeah, I like the page too - and it prompts me to ask you for a specific review</p>
<p>While "intellectual property rights" may not exist, "intellectual property law" sure does and so does "intellectual capital" - sort of. I would like a strict Randroid, a strict Stallmanite, and Baruch Lev himself to have a look at "intellectual capital" and see what else could or should be said.</p>
<p>My approach was to put the non-controversial notions of instructional capital (it's pretty clear atht instructions to do something are a means of production or protection) and individual capital (it's pretty clear that creativity produces something even if we can't say what), but the simplistic models that try to explain *HOW* they fit together seem to be increasingly messy.</p>
<p>If we can focus the controversy into the "intellectual capital" article then we can have relatively stable articles on the way instructions produce value, or individuals (separate from their instructions or intellectual process) contribute value. Which are micro-economic.</p>

<p>Alex, feel free to use my Wiki and recommend others to your "Wikipedia Discussion" page to cover downtime. It's a little late now, but it did seem like a good idea... --LDC</p>

<hr />
<p>Alex, nothing personal, but I feel that certain redirects and changes have been ideologically motivated, whether you're aware of it or not, and raised the issue of 'ideological vandalism' on Talk:Vandalism In Progress</p>
<p>The word "vandalism" is unfortunate but as I understand it here it refers to all violations of Wiki meta guidelines.</p>
<p>We might want to discuss, here, what you believe about "intellectual property law", "viral licenses", "cognitive science of mathematics", as I believe you have some objections to these generalizations of more specific concepts like copyright/patent/trademark, copyleft, and 'mathematics as product of mind' respectively. You are far from the only persons who wants to keep these ideas in a neat clean box, but so far you are the only one stomping articles that offend your sense of them. I'd rather know what you believe about them so that we may come to some agreement and I can point you to the sources that I seem to think are well-known that you seem to think are unique or obscure.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, you are mistaken about a lot of things. First, I did not touch your intellectual property law article. Second, your viral license article was crap, and instead of fixing it, I redirected to a much better discussion of the topic, and pointed out its crappiness in Talk:. I happen to be a fan of viral licenses and have used them for many of my software projects; right now I'm contributing to this php wiki script which is GPL. Regarding philosophy of mathematics: your pet theory, while interesting, is just one of many, certainly not a majority position, and should be presented accordingly. Personally, I'm a Platonist, but fall back to formalism (Curryism) when challenged, because it is the easiest position to defend. I am convinced that any intelligence, whether embodied or not, whether in this universe or elsewhere, will always by necessity arrive at the number pi, the monster group, the normal distribution, the prime number theorem etc. Most working mathematicians believe the same. But working mathematicians have nothing of substance to say about the philosophy of mathematics, just like cooks should shut up when it comes to restaurant criticism. So I haven't written a word about philosophy of math yet. And finally regarding your accusations of bias in September 11 articles: you have shown your own blatant biases by scare quoting "terrorist", as if there were a serious debate about the terroristic qualities of the attacks. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>While I don't particularly take them seriously either, it happens that 24's "pet" theories actually do have a small following among a few serious academics. But then, there are still people who read <i>Social Text</i> and take it seriously too. I agree that we should avoid cluttering most of the rank-and-file articles on math with these ideas, but we probably should mention them in articles like "philosophy of mathematics" and "body philosopher" and "George Lakoff", etc. Just as we mention creationism in the main "evolution" articles, but not in every biology article. --LDC</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Agreed, "most" articles should not mention philosophy of mathematics concerns at all. Extremely fundamental things like <a href="../../../e/u/l/Euler%27s_Identity_abbc.html" title="Euler's Identity">Euler's Identity</a>, pi, monster group, etc., should mention specific issues raised and provide links, but not spend more than a paragraph on it. There are maybe a dozen such articles.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I didn't *write* an intellectual property law article, and if it was not Axel (maybe it was LDC) who broke down the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intellectual_property_law.html" title="Intellectual property law">intellectual property law</a> link inappropriately into three separate links to copyright, patent, and trademark, then I apologize.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>OK, I have some sense of Axel now. Let me try to equalize by responding and laying out my own weird ideas for you both, so you know what's "pet". I am not a Platonist except insofar as the cognitive systems of animals have common fractal geometry (which Turing studied in detail and tried to put limits on, especially neuron growth). I dont shift positions to one that is easier to defend when I am challenged - I let myself be argued against on the same grounds I have promoted/established. I therefore lose more, and learn more. The rest of this is strictly to Axel:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You're entitled to your belief that pi, monster group, normal distribution, prime number theorem, e, and (most controversially) i are divinely determined or just built into the universe or all universes or whatever.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Many friends of mine share them. But it has always been a key question in the philosophy of math whether or which of these basic ideas arises from a desire of humans for some convenient simple notation that doesn't violate their immediate constraints... F=MA is also convenient, but under certain constraints, wrong. I tend to look at math more like physics and expect that "i" in particular will be shown to be a notational convenience at some point. But that's idiosyncratic - I don't even know what <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Lakoff_a8a3.html" title="George Lakoff">George Lakoff</a> thinks of it, I don't mention it, and I make no claim that it has anything to do with the longstanding claim of <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indigenous_peoples.html" title="Indigenous peoples">indigenous peoples</a> that colonists simply look at the applicability of mathematics a different way.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Santa Fe Institute and many others are my source for significance of Euler's Identity, which when I found it was titled "the most remarkable formula in the world" and didn't mention the basic operations that the formula includes, only the constants, as if hte operations were somehow above creating the remarkability... I left it much more neutral than I found it, and will eventually satisfy you that Euler's Identity is central to any cognitive science of mathematics, or to proving that one cannot be made to exist.</dd>

<dd>and given its subjective context and heavy overuse (would you want to see the entire Viet Nam War described as "terrorist attacks on the Vietnamese"?) I believe it must be avoided.

<p>Hey, Axel, I just made the discussed change to <code><a href="../../../l/o/c/Locally_compact.html" title="Locally compact">Locally_compact</a></code>, as well as adding a bunch of new stuff. No, don't bother to look — it's not there. My question to you is, if my browser crashes while I've been editing an article, and I successfully pressed <code>Preview</code> a bunch of times (but never pressed <code>Submit</code>, successfully or no), is there any way to retrieve that text?

<p>Axel, in global warming talk I wrote:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Great job! Now the article flows in one continuous narrative, like something from Time magazine. I couldn't have done it better myself . . .</dd>
</dl>
<p>I stand by that compliment. Creating a continuous narrative is not something I'm good at (I'm still learning how to write a single paragraph that sticks together).</p>
<p><br />
After reading your version and pondering it (through several cycles of read and ponder), I began to have some ideas of improving the opening paragraphs.</p>
<p>I still think we can help improve the article by editing each other's work. You will be better than I am at certain aspects of editing, and you will contribute ideas or knowledge that I do not have. I hope to return the favor, with your consent.</p>

<p>A question for you: any idea if in another english speaking country the decimal comma is used instead of a decimal point? How about in Europe in general? I ask because in the article <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hipparchus.html" title="Hipparchus">hipparchus</a> they write a formula with a 2,5 meaning 2.5. I know in some places that would be correct, but this is supposed to be english. But I don't know if it is a language or country thing. Probably <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decimal_point.html" title="Decimal point">decimal point</a> deserves an article.</p>

<dd>I know that in Germany we use a comma instead of a decimal point; the French and the Spanish do the same; I don't know how it's done in England or Australia. Let's ask around! <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a></dd>

<dd>In Britain we use the decimal point, and a colon for 24-hour time (eg 20:00 for 8pm, not 20,00). Incidentally, the Internet has enshrined a misspelling: if you read web server logs, the site that a user has come from is called the "referer". This should be "referrer", but it got to be a standard before anyone could correct the speeling. <a href="../../../m/s/w/User%7EMswake_21bb.html" title="User:Mswake">Mswake</a> 20:08 Aug 19, 2002 (PDT)</dd>

<dd>I just found a web site for Australian teachers saying that Australia uses decimal points and spaces to separate groups of three digits, not commas. The SI system also apparently uses spaces, not commas for that. However, I think it's safe to say that in an English encyclopedia, a comma instead of a decimal point is out of place. 199.17.238.92 11:51 Aug 20, 2002 (PDT)</dd>

<p>Hi Axel! Sorry I took so long to respond to your question on my Talk page. I've been taking a little breather after the recent debate in the mailing list. You asked me about Auschwitz. Actually, Auschwitz was a collection of many camps, each of which had factories. I am writing off the top of my head right now, but if I remember correctly, Buna (the camp made famous by Elie Wiesel) specialized in rubber, other camps did everything from armaments to road building to tailoring. I will be at work and check out my sources on Tuesday and give you a more complete answer then. Hope this helps in the meanwhile. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">Danny</a></p>
<p>Yup, I'm aware of the various work camps with associated factories.

<p>Matters have deteriorated to a highly abusive level over a website link. Of special concern is the general conduct and attitude of someone called NetEsq, who claims in his details to be a lawyer.</p>
<p>He has repeatedly abused anyone who opposed the idea of the website link with such tactics as net misettiquete ( eg the use of the word 'you' in capitals and bold to emphasise shouting), a poor grasp of history, the unrepentant use of such termsas Nazi, out of context quotes and attempted alienation ("only YOU opppose it").</p>
<p>Regardless of the rights and wrongs of his beliefs, it is very advisable to bring this most unruly and arrogant person into line.</p>

<p>Hi Axel - Just wanted to get a recommendation from you on a good book on Category theory. I'm an autodidact, and am unlikely to take a course in it.</p>
<p>Lots of the edits I've been doing lately seem to be covering topics which are "tweaked" for Abelian categories, but work just as well (with minor alterations) for groups. If I knew enough about category theory, I'd probably just change them to read "in the category of groups", but that's really just my "street" category theory talking - I'm really not qualified to make such an assertion.</p>

<p>I really like the book "Categories for the working mathematician" listed under <a href="../../../c/a/t/Category_theory.html" title="Category theory">category theory</a>; it motivates things quite well, but is definitely not "bathtub reading material". The later chapters are quite esoteric and you can skip them; if you can make it to <a href="../../../a/d/j/Adjoint_functor.html" title="Adjoint functor">adjoint functors</a>, you will know more about categories than most mathematicians. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a> 00:38 Oct 27, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<p>I suspect that the relevant matters largely have to do with the existence of <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kernel_%28category_theory%29.html" title="Kernel (category theory)">kernels</a> and cokernels, but I'm not sure exactly what is required. In the meantime, saying "Abelian categories and the catgory of groups" should cover most applications, even though it's surely not complete. If and when I figure it out, I'll put in more definitive phrasing in those articles (unless, of course, you beat me to it ^_^). And yes, <cite><a href="../../../c/a/t/Categories_for_the_Working_Mathematician_9853.html" title="Categories for the Working Mathematician">Categories for the Working Mathematician</a></cite> by <a href="../../../s/a/u/Saunders_Mac_Lane_74e8.html" title="Saunders Mac Lane">Saunders Mac Lane</a> is a classic.

<p>Kernels and Cokernels are often only defined for preadditive categories, and the category of groups doesn't fit. It really seems to play a special role.</p>
<dl>
<dd>See <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kernel_%28category_theory%29.html" title="Kernel (category theory)">Kernel (category theory)</a> for what is needed. The category of groups has zero morphisms, although we typically don't call them "zero"; they are the trivial homomorphisms.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Does the category of <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monoid.html" title="Monoid">monoids</a> have cokernels? Our proof of the <a href="../../../f/i/v/Five_lemma.html" title="Five lemma">five lemma</a> doesn't apply there. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a> 16:11 Oct 31, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Monoids also have zero morphisms, so the concept of kernel makes sense for them. One might hope that kernels don't in fact <i>exist</i> there, but they do (the preimage of the identity as usual). However, there is a sense in which these kernels are not good enough; they lose information; you can't reconstruct the entire kernel pair (which measures the deviation from monomorphismness of a morphism) from the kernel in this category, as you can in preadditive categories or in the category of groups. This is why monoid theorists don't study the preimage of the identity but instead study the <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kernel_%28algebra%29.html" title="Kernel (algebra)">notion of kernel from universal algebra</a>, which is really more analogous to the kernel pair than to the category-theoretic kernel.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So, there should be some condition that a category must satisfy for these sorts of lemmas to hold, and I think that it will be something about kernels and cokernels, but it must require more than their mere existence. I will try to figure it out, or look it up; my guess at this moment is:
<ul>
<li>The category has zero morphisms (necessary for the remaining conditions to make sense);</li>
<li>Kernels and cokernels always exist (in the category theoretic sense);</li>
<li>ker coker ker = ker, and coker ker coker = coker.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>These are all true for Abelian categories and for the category of groups, but the last fails in the category of monoids.</dd>

<p>Hey, I just noticed something neat. Given an object <i>A</i> in a category with all kernels and cokernels, ker induces an order reversing function from Sub(<i>A</i>) to Quot(<i>A</i>), while coker goes the other way. Then the last axiom above states that this a Galois correspondence between posets. In this case, a subobject or quotient object is normal in the category-theoretic sense iff it's normal in the Galois-theoretic sense. Of course, both uses of the term "normal" ultimately derive from a basic example featuring normal subgroups, so it's really no coincidence. — <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7EToby_Bartels_e090.html" title="User:Toby Bartels">Toby</a> 05:21 Nov 3, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, that's nice. Maybe we should have an article which compares the various notions of "normal".</p>
<p>I'm still wondering whether the category of monoids has cokernels though. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a> 16:03 Nov 4, 2002 (UTC)</p>

<p>Axel, the numbering was "reset" after Friedrich Wilhelm III the Duke of Prussia, proclaimed himself Friedrich Wilhelm I the King in Prussia in 1701. Friedrich Wilhelm I, der Grosse Kurfürst (the Great Elector)the duke of Prussia (1620-1688) is the one who managed to turn the Polish Province into independent Duchy in 1660.<br />
I hope this is helpful, Axel, although I'm sure Helga could've explained it better. BTW, where is Helga? Is she OK? I kinda miss her in a unique sort of way.<br />

The process of giving unique Goedel identifer to each <i>grammatical expression</i> in one axiomatic system ( one version of the foundations of mathematics, usually identified as <i>principia mathematica</i>.), is a reletively straight forward matter.</p>
<ol>
<li>Grammatically true statements in their minimum form may be identified by hand or in software implementaion. They are expressed in a language of symbolic logic. Each term used in the symbolic logic is uniquely identified with a natural number.</li>
<li>Grammatically true statements are uniquely identified with a number through a mark-up procedure involving an member of the prime number sequence used as a power on each term of the expresion. The results of each operation are summed.</li>
<li>Following this procedure will produce uniquely identifiable positve number for each expression of sybolic logic.</li>
</ol>
<p>Because it was a work of philosophy, in the field of meta-Matematics, the fact that the numbers become arbitraily huge after a few terms is irrelevant. For a philosopher, the fact that this can be done in any disipline that depends on symblic logic (including all fields of study in science <i>that use mathematics</i>.) Some statements have comparatively small number values.</p>

<p>Anatomical position&lt;G&gt;.

<dd>Sorry to but in here, but I'm guessing the reason this is designated the natural position is because of pictures. The diagrams in my old EMT textbook are simple drawings of the human body intended to be unambiguous and two-dimensional, basically your average sketch with the major body parts at easily identifiable places -- the thumb isn't normally parallel with the other fingers, but the simplest drawings don't differentiate. It isn't intended to be the position the body naturally falls in, just a simple uniform diagram that people out in the field can easily picture and apply to the victim in question. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a></dd>

I find that the notation under the proof sketch to be a little awry. In particular, for example, the notation G(F) should be G(F(x)).

<p>Hello Axel,</p>
<p>Thank you for correcting the PMBOK entry.</p>
<p>I'm looking for volunteers to develop a GNU Free Documentation License Project Management Standard (just like the PMBOK, but possibly better). What do you think about it? <a href="../../../m/k/o/User%7EMkoval_d14d.html" title="User:Mkoval">User:Mkoval</a> Apr 3, 2003.</p>
<hr />
<p>Hi Axel:</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply to my previous message. It is not my intention to be predantic, but I think my proposed changes make the sketch slightly easier to understand. In addition to notational changes, and the adding of some clarifying text, I changed "proven" and "unproven" to "proved" and "unproved" because I could not find "unproven" in my dictionary. I will reply on your opinion about whether my proposed changes are useful before making them. My proposed revision is below. I have underlined my changes to highlight them.</p>
<p>By the way, I am currently working on a short paper which reconsiders the incompleteness theorem in the context of a three valued system where the three truth vlaues may be interpreted as TRUE, FALSE, and PARADOX. I wonder if you might be interested in reading it.</p>
<p>Proof sketch for the first theorem</p>
<p>The main problem in fleshing out the above mentioned proof idea is the following: in order to construct a statement p that is equivalent to "p cannot be proven", p would have to somehow contain a reference to p, which could easily end in an infinite regress. Gödel's ingenious trick, which was later used by Alan Turing to solve the Entscheidungsproblem, will be described below.</p>
<p>First of all, every formula or statement that can be formulated in our system gets a unique number, called its Gödel number . This is done in such a way that it is easy to mechanically convert back and forth between formulas and Gödel numbers. Because our system is strong enough to reason about numbers, it is now also possible to reason about formulas.</p>
<p>A formula F(x) that contains exactly one free variable x is called a statement form. As soon as x is replaced by a specific number, the statement form turns into a bona fide statement, and it then is either provable in the system, or not. Statement forms themselves are not statements and therefore cannot be <u>proved</u> or <u>disproved</u>. But every statement form F(x) has a Gödel number which we will denote by G(F). The choice of the free variable used in the form F(x) is not relevant to the assignment of the Gödel number G(F).</p>
<p>By carefully analyzing the axioms and rules of the system, one can then write down a statement form P(x) which embodies the idea that x is the Gödel number of a statement which can be proven in our system. Formally: P(x) can <u>proved</u> if and only if x is the Gödel number of a statement that can be <u>proved</u>. (While this is good enough for this proof sketch, it is technically not completely accurate. See Gödel's paper for the problem and Rosser's paper for the resolution. The key word is "omega-consistency".)</p>
<p>Now comes the trick: a statement form F(x) is called self-unprovable if <u>~P(F(G(F)))</u>, i.e. the form F applied to its own Gödel number, is not provable. This concept can be defined formally, and therefore we can construct a statement form <u>SU(y)</u> which embodies the concept: <u>SU(y)</u> is provable if and only if <u>y</u> is the Gödel number of a self-unprovable statement form. <u>That is, y = G(F) for some particular form F(x), and ~P(F(G(F))).</u> Then define the statement p = SU(G(SU)). This is the statement p that was mentioned above.</p>
<p>Intuitively, we are now asking the question: "Is the property of being self-unprovable itself self-unprovable?" This is very reminiscent of the Barber paradox: the barber who shaves precisely those people who don't shave themselves, does he shave himself?</p>
<p>If p were provable, then SU(G(SU)) would be true, and by definition of SU, that would make <u>y</u> = G(SU) the Gödel number of a self-unprovable statement form, hence SU would be self-unprovable, which by definition of self-unprovable means that SU(G(SU)) is not provable, but this was our p: p is not provable. This contradiction shows that p cannot be provable.</p>
<p>If the negation of p were provable, then, assuming our system to be consistent, p cannot also be provable, i.e. SU(G(SU)) is not provable, and by definition of SU this means that <u>y</u> = G(SU) is not the Gödel number of a self-unprovable form, which implies that SU is not self-unprovable. By definition of self-unprovable, we conclude that SU(G(SU)) is provable, hence p is provable. Again a contradiction. This one shows that the negation of p cannot be provable either.</p>

<p>Hi Alex:</p>
<p>I uploaded a revision in which I accepted your suggestion to leave the text with G(F) rather than G(F(x)), but I added some explanatory text.</p>
<p>I just printed out a copy of the Goedel proof from the web page reference, but I haven't had time to re-read it yet. Off hand, I tend to agree that the "only if" should be removed. I'm not sure I get the connection with inconsistancy, although if there is a connection then of course every statement would be provable.</p>
<p>Regarding my paper on a three valued interpretation, it is a work in progress. I don't expect to have a complete draft for a while yet, but if you would like me to send yoi a sketch of what I have in mind, I would be happy to do that.</p>

<p>Hi Alex:</p>
<p>I think your edit to the proof sketch is a very good improvement.</p>
<p>I finally got my personal web site up. There is a link on my User page. I would appreciate any comments you would care to make about anything I have there. When I complete a draft of the paper on a three valued re-intepretation of the Goedel theorem, I will post it there.</p>

<p>Re: Persuasion Technology. A bizzarre, rambling document. I tried paring it down to make it clearer some months back. Not that fuzzy thinking is much improved by fixing grammar. I had hoped the author would take the hint to de-ramble it. Instead, the author immediately restored the original text verbatim without comment. So I put the NPOV dispute at the top and watched. If the author is now banned, perhaps you will fair better. User:Williamv1138:Williamv1138</p>

<p>Axel, I am writing to you because you have been active in Wikipedia for a long time. I have been in an edit war with JTDIRL and 172 on the China page, and I think there is both a need for some intervention, and an intervention that is not based on any argument about China, but rather about Wikipedia conventions, especially NPOV and naming conventions. I wrote to Mav who made a very brief and in my opinion constructive comment on the talk page a couple of days ago, although nothing has come of it. I have thought of asking some others, but you are one of the most experienced people here. And, as I said, I think what is most needed now is some explicit discussion of Wikipedia conventions.</p>
<p>To fully gradp the debate behind the edit war you would have to read a lot. Minimally, I would suggest reading the entire Talk: China (Archive 3) and <a href="../../../c/h/i/Talk%7EChina_0d00.html" title="Talk:China">Talk: China</a> pages (which I know is a lot to ask of someone who may not be so interested. As a party to the dispute and biased, I don't want to misrepresent it, but I will try to sum it up.</p>
<p>The question is, how to identify the Chinese (specifically, PRC) state. The article identified the state as communist. I checked the Chinese Constitution which states that it is a socialist state; an official Chinese website states that it is not a communist state. JTDIRL and 172 responded that all political scientists identify China as a communist state and that we should go by what Western scholars do. I talked to a few colleagues of mine -- a sociologist, two anthropologitsts, and a political scientist. They told me that many political scientists used to label China a communist state but that they are moving away from that designation, considering it inaccurate and meaningless; that many political scientists and most other scholars identify China as a socialist state, although some qualify it as "late" or "post" socialist. Now JTDIRL claims that it doesn't matter what political scientists say, that what ought to be presented is a "formal encyclopædic definition."</p>
<p>Now, I never heard of this phrase and doubt that it should be the basis of our deciding how to identify any state, as what we are trying to do is, arguably, devise a formal encyclopedic definition. I think he means we should call it a communist state because other encyclopedias do. I still think we ought to call it something that reflects the current state of scholarship.</p>
<p>But I hope you can see why I think this is a matter of clarifying general wikipedia conventions or norms, and not just a debate over China. And I hope you understand why I have turned to you.</p>
<p>I am <i>not</i> asking anyone to say "SLR is right and JTDIRL is wrong." I am asking the community, such as it is, to discuss the conventions and clarify them as they may apply to the case.</p>
<p>If you do not feel comfortable doing this, but understand why I bring it up, could you post this on the listserve for discussion? Either way, I appreciate your reading this far! <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a></p>

<p>Would you mind explaining your changes to <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limit_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Limit (mathematics)">limit (mathematics)</a>? <a href="../../../p/i/z/User%7EPizza_Puzzle_d32e.html" title="User:Pizza Puzzle">Pizza Puzzle</a></p>
<p>yes but from "division-by-zero" you cut:</p>
<ul>
<li>In cases where substitution results in 0 / 0, a limit probably exists; in other cases (such as 17 / 0) a limit is less likely. For instance; if <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) = x³ + 1 / <i>x</i> - 1; then, if one substitutes 1 for <i>x</i>, one will obtain 2 / 0; the limit of <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) (as <i>x</i> approaches 1) does not exist, as <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) is unbounded
<ul>
<li>this should be rewritten to state, "the numerator is 0" rathern than " 0 / 0" but I do not think it should be cut. <a href="../../../p/i/z/User%7EPizza_Puzzle_d32e.html" title="User:Pizza Puzzle">Pizza Puzzle</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>and (<i>x</i>² - 6<i>x</i>) / x involved a notably different technique than (x³ - 1) / (x - 1) , which I argue to be just as "nice" of a technique</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>and, yes, the absolute value definition duplicates a paragraph further down in the formal section, but it does so informally which makes it far more useful for the neophyte reader <a href="../../../p/i/z/User%7EPizza_Puzzle_d32e.html" title="User:Pizza Puzzle">Pizza Puzzle</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The statement "In cases where substitution results in 0 / 0, a limit probably exists; in other cases (such as 17 / 0) a limit is less likely." is simply false: 0/0 may or may not exist and 17/0 never exists. We have examples of both cases.</p>
<p>The technique for the two example functions is the same: use algebra to rewrite your function until you can plug in <i>c</i>. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a> 21:25 18 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>1.b4 (Your move!) You also deleted (at <a href="../../../p/r/o/Product_rule.html" title="Product rule">product rule</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Development of this rule is credited to <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gottfried_Leibniz_ece1.html" title="Gottfried Leibniz">Leibniz</a>; who demonstrated that (<i>x</i> + <i>dx</i>)(<i>y</i> + <i>dy</i>) - <i>xy</i> = <i>x</i>(<i>dy</i>) + <i>y</i>(<i>dx</i>); as <i>(dx)(dy)</i> is "negligible".
<ul>
<li>As sources I offer <i>The History of Mathematics</i> by Burton and <i>Calculus of a Single Variable: Early Transcendental Functions (3rd Edition) by Edwards, Hostetler, and Larson</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Is this not true?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Oh yes, I meant to put that into a history section, maybe with a little bit more information, then I forgot about it.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Also, I am of the understanding that this is <b>the</b> <b>P</b>roduct <b>R</b>ule; not merely <b>a</b> product rule. <a href="../../../p/i/z/User%7EPizza_Puzzle_d32e.html" title="User:Pizza Puzzle">Pizza Puzzle</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, but in the math arena we decided a while ago to use lower case throughout, for instance <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fermat%27s_last_theorem.html" title="Fermat's last theorem">Fermat's last theorem</a>.

<p>If everyone agrees its "strange" (I havent heard anybody actually support it) why continue to do it?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, some math books use the lower case style, and there's a general tendency to use lower case in titles, because in article texts people are much more likely to write "product rule" than "Product Rule".</dd>

<p>Yes, <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) is continuous at each point of its domain; but, the function has a discontinuity at x = 1; thus, the domain of <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) is all real numbers except x = 1. Or so I understand...</p>

Also the "real life" B&amp;N mentions on camera hinges on Vertov's two phrases "life caught unawares" and "life as it is," which are commonly confused for each other and actually mean two distinct things. In short, I would say the last two sentences of the B&amp;N article can go without qualification; the previous two need serious qualification; and the rest is crap. <a href="../../../k/o/y/User%7EKoyaanis_Qatsi_7ab5.html" title="User:Koyaanis Qatsi">Koyaanis Qatsi</a> 02:21 15 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Axel,</p>
<p>I like your bookmarklet for searching Wikipedia, but I want to adapt it for phrase search. I tried (for IE)</p>
<p>javascript:s=(document.frames.length?'':document.selection.createRange().text);for(i=0;i&lt;document.frames.length;i++){if(s)break;s=document.frames[i].document.selection.createRange().text;}if(!s)void(s=prompt('Enter search terms for Wikipedia:',''));wikiw=window.open('http://wikipedia.com/'+(s?('wiki.phtml?search='+'"'+escape(s)+'"'):''));wikiw.focus()</p>
<p>i.e. putting the phrase in quotes, e.g. for "closed and reclaimed" I get</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki.phtml?search=%22closed%2520and%2520reclaimed%22" class="external free" title="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki.phtml?search=%22closed%2520and%2520reclaimed%22" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki.phtml?search=%22closed%2520and%2520reclaimed%22</a></p>
<p>which does not work; using the wikipedia search box one gets</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?search=%22closed+and+reclaimed%22" class="external free" title="http://www.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?search=%22closed+and+reclaimed%22" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?search=%22closed+and+reclaimed%22</a></p>
<p>which gives the right result.</p>

<p>Can you help me with something in math? I know this question is not wikipedia, but you're a math professor, so I though I could ask you. If I can't, that's OK. I'm trying to learn first-order predicate calculus from a book I got in my local library, and I understood most of it, but I just got stuck. Right now, they are proving that predicate calculus is complete, so they are working with tautologies in the process. I don't understand the difference between the truth of a statement and if it is a tautology. I don't know why they are reproving things like modus ponens with tautologies instead of proofs, and subsequently I don't understand these proofs (they are just in English, not in any formal mathematical statement). The <a href="../../../t/a/u/Tautology_%28logic%29.html" title="Tautology (logic)">tautology</a> article doesn't offer much help and neither does MathWorld. Am I in over my head? <a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELittleDan_7151.html" title="User:LittleDan">LDan</a> 01:52, 29 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>There's a subtle difference between true statements <i>about</i> predicate calculus, and tautologies. The following is a true statement about predicate calculus:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Whenever <i>p</i>→<i>q</i> holds and <i>p</i> holds, then <i>q</i> holds as well.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is not a statement <i>within</i> the predicate calculus, but it is a statement <i>about</i> the predicate calculus, a so-called meta statement. And it is a true meta statement, called the modus ponens. Now a <i>tautology</i> is a formula <i>within</i> predicate calculus, which holds no matter what the variables stand for. The following is a tautology within predicate calculus</p>
<dl>
<dd>((<i>p</i>→<i>q</i>)∧<i>p</i>)→<i>q</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>This formula holds always, no matter what you replace <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> with. And obviously, this tautology is closely related with the above meta statement, almost identical (and also sometimes called the modus ponens). In the chapter you're reading, they are probably currently proving these tautologies, assuming the corresponding meta statements. If you don't know the difference, then these proofs may look pointless. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a> 10:43, 29 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>While Keating's conviction was overturned on technicalities, he spent 4 1/2 years in prison, and pleaded guilty in April 1999 to reduced charges <a href="http://www.hollandsentinel.com/stories/080799/new_charleskeating.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hollandsentinel.com/stories/080799/new_charleskeating.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> which would let him out of prison. I think there were also some new hearings, possibly even a new trial. So I do not consider your current presentation entirely accurate, but I will abstain from editing the article until a conclusion has been reached regarding the basics.<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">—Eloquence</a> 00:32, Oct 27, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That article is good, but <a href="../../../m/o/t/Mother_Teresa_71c4.html" title="Mother Teresa">Mother Teresa</a> should note that Keating spent 4 1/2 years in prison for the Savings &amp; Loan scandal. "Turley's statements have never been proven" is POV -- would Turley agree with that? He would probably say that his statements have been proven, but that the proof was ignored by the higher court on grounds of a technicality. IMHO the whole sentence is redundant with the "overturned" part.<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">—Eloquence</a> 01:00, Oct 27, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The "technicality" was that the jury never determined whether Keating <i>intended</i> to defraud the victims, and that is of course the whole thrust of Turley's statements. In the end, the 50 months Keating spent in federal prison were for a bankruptcy fraud only marginally related to and much smaller than the S&amp;L scandal; his two convictions in that scandal were both overturned. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a> 02:08, 27 Oct 2003 (UTC)</dd>

Perhaps also of interest: "By 1960, Keating was testifying before the U.S. House of Representatives armed with, according to a Cincinnati Enquirer article, 'hundreds of books and magazines -- purchased at newsstands throughout the country -- describing and depicting a variety of perverse sexual activities' After Keating's testimony...the House subcommittee burned the mass of material." <a href="http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Lofts/2613/ccv.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Lofts/2613/ccv.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">—Eloquence</a> 14:17, Oct 27, 2003 (UTC)~</dd>

<p>Well, it wasn't a definition. <i>If, given the graphs A and B, and B which is an expansion of A, it is often described that A is <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homeomorphism.html" title="Homeomorphism">homeomorphic</a> to B.</i></p>
<p>The statement is technically correct, but readers could very easily leave with the mistaken impression that this is the definition of <i>homeomorphic</i>. For example, the graphs</p>

<p>and</p>
<pre>
   * - * - * - *

<p>Hi Axel, just a quick one to ask why "my" caption on <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edith_Piaf_3705.html" title="Edith Piaf">Edith Piaf</a> was changed to largish font? I think the larger font looks a little ugly because it's now very slightly larger than the text.

<p>Axel, regarding the two math questions you left on my talk page. The theorem about the dimensions of division algebras is usually stated for real division algebras. I suspect it's capable of some generalization, but I'm don't know for certain. Also, it does apply to fields -- the proper definition of dimension of a division algebra is its dimension as a vector space over its center, so fields always have dimension 1. I do know the most general statement, which is that the dimension of a division algebra is always a square.</p>
<p>Regarding Gelfand-Mazur, since Banach algebras are by definition associative, so trivially Gelfand-Mazur applies to associative algebras. I think Mazur's theorem, and the various generalizations and variants of Gelfand-Mazur that are sometimes also called the Gelfand-Mazur theorem all require associativity. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELoren_Rosen_2e64.html" title="User:Loren Rosen">Loren Rosen</a> 22:44, 20 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I thought the paragraph was good; I changed only one little thing: we don't usually reject a hypothesis if our measurements are only one standard deviation away from the prediction; more commonly a 95% rule is used, which roughly corresponds to two standard deviations if we assume normally distributed measurement errors. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a> 02:38, 11 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks, <a href="../../../o/m/e/User%7EOmegatron_4264.html" title="User:Omegatron">Omegatron</a></p>
<p>Here's what I think I know about this: quantum mechanics postulates that the state of a system is described by a vector in a Hilbert space, and an observable (a variable like position or momentum) is modeled by an operator on that space. Given such a state and an observable, i.e. a vector and an operator, one can compute the probability distribution of the outcomes of measurements of that variable. Now from these postulates, one can prove purely formally that an uncertainty principle holds: it relates the product of the uncertainties of two variables to the commutator of the corresponding operators. All this doesn't need Fourier transforms.</p>
<p>Now, this uncertainty principle is completely general; the traditional uncertainty principle however is concerned with particular variables: position and momentum. Position is modeled by the operator "multiplication with x" and momentum by the operator "-i d/dx" (both are operators on the Hilbert space of square integrable functions f(x)). Now it turns out that the Fourier transform of -i df/dx is 2 π s F(s) (if F(s) is the Fourier transform of f(x)). From this, and the fact that the Fourier transform is invertible and compatible with the inner product in L<sup>2</sup>, one derives that the probability distribution of the momentum variable is the Fourier transform of the probability distribution of the position variable. Furthermore, there is a general theorem about Fourier transforms (unrelated to the above theorem about operators) which says something like "the standard deviation of g(x), times the standard deviation of G(s) (the Fourier transform of g(x)), is always bigger than 1/2." (See <a href="http://www.physics.uiowa.edu/~gpayne/teaching/uncert.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.physics.uiowa.edu/~gpayne/teaching/uncert.pdf" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>; this is often called the "uncertainty principle for Fourier transforms".) This then yields an alternative proof of the physical uncertainty principle. The advantage of this proof is that it doesn't need fancy Hilbert space operator magic, and that it gives some intuition behind the uncertainty relation: just like a signal cannot be simultaneously concentrated in time and frequency, a measurement cannot be simultaneously concentrated in position and momentum. The disadvantage of this second proof is that it only works for these particular observables (position and momentum), or slightly more generally for any pair of observables whose operators are related by the Fourier transform. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a> 13:28, 26 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Axel, I noticed on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_pictures_98bd.html#List_of_Pictures_Requested" title="Wikipedia:Requested pictures">Wikipedia:Requested_pictures#List_of_Pictures_Requested</a> that several months ago you requested a drawing of the inner workings of the <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heart.html" title="Heart">heart</a>.

<dd>Nah, you only hear from the unsatisfied. I went back to standard for a while, but found it crufty and old-fashioned, so I'm back with monobook. I guess 50% of the complaints (and the most bitter) stem from the cache-snafu prone transitional period (and the categories layout bug period). The only long-lasting issue is (I think) the verdana diacrita placement bug, which (if it isn't sorted already - I wouldn't know!) is something we do need to address. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 15:49, 9 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I love the new layout. As I experience it (Mac OS X 10.3.4, Safari) it looks prettier <b>and</b> the text is more legible <b>and</b> the pages are just as information-dense or maybe denser than before. There are very minor glitches—for example, the article creation text tells you to click "edit this page" but the tab, of course, just reads "edit." <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> 00:06, 10 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I like the new layout too - especially how each user can <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User_styles" class="extiw" title="m:User_styles">customize it for themselves</a>.

<p>In general, I like the new layout, but I still can't agree with overriding the user's default font choices, and forcing a sans-serif font in particular.

<dd>Well, it's a matter of taste really; I don't like to inline TeX because the TeX's font size doesn't match the font size of the surrounding HTML, and because it seems a waste to transmit a whole png file where a simple HTML character would do.

He claims there that there isn't really a significant difference in the transfer of a .png and HTML; I was initially under the impression that HTML <i>had</i> to be faster. I also agree that the problem seems to lie in the rendering of .pngs inline. However, I'm definitely not savvy on the intricacies of this matter, and as a relative newcomer to Wikipedia I won't be entering into these debates too deeply.

<dd>The cardinality of the index set can be as high as you like, and higher :-) For instance, the set of all functions from <b>R</b> to <b>R</b> is often written as <b>R</b><sup><b>R</b></sup>, i.e. a cartesian product of many copies of <b>R</b>, where as index set we take <b>R</b> itself. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a> 02:09, 8 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it would be ok to list your concerns about natural current on the Natural units page, especially if Planck never used that notion (but others clearly do, so we shouldn't just delete it). Your other thoughts on natural units make sense to me, but I think they fall into the category of "original research", i.e. ideas that haven't been published and are not (yet) widely accepted, and we try to keep original research out of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a> 22:14, 13 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<li>How can subtraction be performed by string concatenation? It kinda could be done by doing a reverse write on a turing machine, but this is before the article mentions turing machines.
<ul>
<li>You subtract by finding a string that can be concatenated to the second to yield the first. That's the "little more" part. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a> 19:20, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>Regarding your changes at <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poincar%C3%A9_duality.html" title="Poincaré duality">Poincaré duality</a>: Why not allow natural transformations between covariant and contravariant functors? One just need to reverse the appropriate arrow — indeed, the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_transformation.html" title="Natural transformation">natural transformation</a> article states precisely this. One can then say that a vector space equipped with a inner product is naturally isomorphic to its dual whereas an ordinary vector space is not. -- <a href="../../../f/r/o/User%7EFropuff_31b9.html" title="User:Fropuff">Fropuff</a> 04:49, 2004 Dec 1 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's an interesting point. I never really thought about it, I guess the definitions I saw were always stated for two covariant or for two contravariant functors. One problem may be that the inverse of a natural isomorphism in your sense need not be a natural isomorphism anymore, so the relation of "being naturally isomorphic" ceases to be symmetrical, which is kind of unintuitive. Also, I don't think that your example works, an Euclidean space won't be naturally isomorphic to its dual in your sense: take the zero morphism V-&gt;W; then the induced diagram involving V, W, V* and W* won't commute.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Have you seen the notion of natural transformation between covariant and contravariant functors defined somewhere? If not, then I propose we remove it from the natural transformation article again. Cheers, <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a> 18:02, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>As far as the example goes: in the category of vector spaces with inner products the morphisms should be linear maps which preserve the inner product; in which case 0 is no good. Actually it's not hard to see that the diagram involving V, W, V* and W* commutes iff the linear map preserves the inner product. So the example still works.</p>
<p>The only category theory book I have is Mac Lane. As far as I can tell he only defines NT between covariant functors. The place where I have seen the more general definition is in a book by John Lee called <i>An introduction to smooth manifolds</i>. He uses a variation of the above example to claim that the tangent bundle and cotangent bundle of a Riemannian manifold are naturally isomorphic.</p>
<p>I'm not sure about your point regarding symmetry. The construction seems symmetrical to me. I'll have to think about it more. Can you think of any counterexamples? -- <a href="../../../f/r/o/User%7EFropuff_31b9.html" title="User:Fropuff">Fropuff</a> 21:26, 2004 Dec 1 (UTC)</p>
<p>You are of course right with the morphisms in the category of inner product spaces, sorry about that. Let's stick to finite-dimensional real inner product spaces for now. I see that, given an inner product space (<i>V</i>,&lt;,&gt;), there's a canonical inner product on <i>V</i>* and a canonical isomorphism between <i>V</i> and <i>V</i>* which respects the inner products, but I don't see how it turns into a <i>natural</i> isomorphism in your sense. In fact, I don't even see how the assignment <i>V</i> <code>|-&gt;</code> <i>V</i>* can be made into a (contravariant) functor. If <i>f</i> : <i>V</i> → <i>W</i> is a map that is compatible with the respective inner products, then I would like to define <i>f</i><sup>*</sup> : <i>W</i><sup>*</sup> → <i>V</i><sup>*</sup> by <i>f</i><sup>*</sup>(φ) = φ<i>f</i> for every φ in <i>W</i><sup>*</sup>, but that won't be compatible with the inner products on <i>W</i><sup>*</sup> and <i>V</i><sup>*</sup> (unless <i>V</i> and <i>W</i> happen to have the same dimension). So I guess it really only works if we consider the category of inner product spaces of a fixed dimension.</p>
<p>Regarding the asymmetry: if there exists a natural transformation η from the covariant <i>F</i> to the contravariant <i>G</i>, and every map η<sub><i>X</i></sub> is an isomorphism, then it's clear that <i>F</i>(φ) is a mono and <i>G</i>(φ) is an epi for all morphisms φ. On the other hand, if there exists a natural isomorphism from <i>G</i> to <i>F</i> then <i>G</i>(φ) is mono and <i>F</i>(φ) is epi for all φ. Since these conditions are asymmetrical, I assumed that one can construct an example where only one of the two conditions is true, i.e. where <i>F</i> is naturally isomorphic to <i>G</i> but <i>G</i> is not naturally isomorphic to <i>F</i>.</p>
<p>Here's such an example: take <i>C</i> to be the category with two objects <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, two identity morphisms and one morphism φ from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>. Let <i>D</i> be the category of sets. Let <i>F</i>(<i>a</i>) = <i>G</i>(<i>a</i>) be the set {0} and <i>F</i>(<i>b</i>)=<i>G</i>(<i>b</i>) be the set {0,1}. Let <i>F</i>(φ)(0)=0. Let <i>G</i>(φ)(<i>x</i>) = 0 for <i>x</i>=0,1. Then <i>F</i> : <i>C</i> → <i>D</i> is a covariant functor and <i>G</i> : <i>C</i> → <i>D</i> is a contravariant functor. Taking η<sub><i>a</i></sub> and η<sub><i>b</i></sub> to be the identity maps on {0} and {0,1} respectively, we have η<sub><i>a</i></sub> = <i>G</i>(φ)η<sub><i>b</i></sub><i>F</i>(φ), so <i>F</i> is naturally isomorphic to <i>G</i> in your sense. But <i>G</i> is not naturally isomorphic to <i>F</i> since <i>G</i>(φ) is not mono.</p>
<p>The two examples seem to suggest that your notion of natural transformation makes good sense only if all morphisms in <i>D</i> are invertible. In that case, <i>D</i> is a <a href="../../../g/r/o/Groupoid.html" title="Groupoid">groupoid</a>, and it is isomorphic to its own opposite category. Your notion of natural transformation can then be reduced to the ordinary notion, by using this isomorphism. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a> 01:57, 3 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ah, I see your point now. Thank you. You are quite right. Your point about the dimension of the vector spaces is also correct; I hadn't thought about that. In any case, one can always define natural transformations between co- and contravariant functors (whether or not it's a useful definition is another question). I agree, however, that natural <i>isomorphisms</i> only make sense in groupoids (where the auxillary definition isn't really necessary). Somehow, I still like the vector space example, even in the restricted setting you mention. It's nice to analyze the naturality without having to jump through the hoop of turning the dual space functor into a covariant one.</p>
<p>Regarding Poincaré duality: it would make more sense to me to claim that <i>H</i><sup><i>k</i></sup> and <i>H</i><sub><i>n</i>−<i>k</i></sub> are not naturally isomorphic because the associated diagram doesn't commute for all <i>f</i> : <i>M</i> → <i>N</i> rather than to say that one is contravariant and one covariant (I believe the diagram <i>does</i> commute if <i>f</i> is a homeomorphism). Wouldn't this imply that Poincaré duality <i>is</i> natural in the category of orientable Riemannian manifolds of fixed dimension (again, a groupoid)?</p>
<p>Incidentely, one can make a statement about the naturality of the cap product along the lines we've been discussing, albeit in a somewhat weird way -- see <a href="http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATpage.html" class="external text" title="http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATpage.html" rel="nofollow">Hatcher's Algebraic topology book</a>, top of p. 241. -- <a href="../../../f/r/o/User%7EFropuff_31b9.html" title="User:Fropuff">Fropuff</a> 15:53, 2004 Dec 3 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ok, I agree that we should mention the way in which Poincaré duality is natural, so I added it to the article now.

<p>If I understood the history of "Monad (Category Theory)" correctly, you are the person who wrote that a monad can be seen as a monoid object in a functor category. How is this supposed to work? Are you claiming that T o T is the product of an endofuctor T : C → C in the functor category C^C? That seems wrong. Please clarify, since I am tempted to change it.</p>
<p>As far as I can see, the functor category C^C has products if C has products, in which case they are computed point-wise. So, it cannot be right that a monad is a monoid in C^C.</p>
<p>If you would like a relationship between monads and monoids, you can say this: a monoid M can be seen as a monad defined by T(X) = M x X, mu_X : M x M x X --&gt; M x X maps (m, n, x) to (m n, x) and eta_X maps x to (e, x) where e is the unit of M.</p>
