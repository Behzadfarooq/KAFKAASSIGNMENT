<p>I apologise for RickK's rudeness. He lacks tact. Basically on Wikipedia, to avoid reactions like this, we leave spellings the way the original author wrote them. Only in country (or culture) specific articles do we favour one spelling over another. So we use Australian English on <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>, but US English on <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>, for example.

<p>I am reorganizing the sections on language examples in each of the consonant articles (trying to make them all fit the same format), and I noticed the English language example, <i>canyon</i>, you added on <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palatal_nasal.html" title="Palatal nasal">palatal nasal</a>. Is that an Australian pronunciation? I'm not sure I've ever heard it pronounced that way (by the way, I'm from the US). I just wanted to make sure before I move things around.

<dd>That surprises me, because I watch American programs on TV (there are alot on our TV channels) and to me that's how Americans pronounce <i>canyon</i>, just as we do here in Australia. This is definitely a correct pronunciation (if not for North Americans) from both Australian &amp; British dictionaries that I have. If your confused about the two different pronunciations, one is the <b>broad transcription</b> (between the <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slash_%28punctuation%29.html" title="Slash (punctuation)">slashes</a>) and the other is the <b>narrow transcription</b> (between the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bracket.html" title="Bracket">square brackets</a>). Could you give me an example of how Americans pronounce <i>canyon</i> from a dictionary using <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Phonetic_Alphabet_96f8.html" title="International Phonetic Alphabet">IPA</a>? -- Kind regards, <a href="../../../a/x/s/User%7EAxSkov_dc6f.html" title="User:AxSkov">AxSkov</a> 14:29, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm used to hearing either [kænjən] or [kænjn̩]. My dictionary gives kan'yən, which could be either of the those (American dictionaries are weird about ə, they think everything is a ə). I don't think Americans generally pronounce Spanish ñ correctly, even when speaking Spanish, much less for loanwords. Even in Spanish class in high school, I was taught to pronounce Spanish ñ as [nj], not [ɲ]. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyborgTosser_1c56.html" title="User:CyborgTosser">CyborgTosser</a> (<a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyborgTosser_eb9c.html" title="User talk:CyborgTosser">Only half the battle</a>) 19:51, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm having a hard time finding an American dictionary that uses IPA. Neither Websters New World or American Heritage use IPA. Both, by the way, give only one pronunciation, but I guess that doesn't really mean anything, considering it's a wide transcription. Since I have to rely on my own observations, I decided to write the word down and ask several of my friends to speak it. I got a sampling of dialects from the midwest (myself), the southwest, the northwest, Hawaii, and a non-native speaker (Vietnamese). Everyone said [nj], except the guy from the southwest, who occasionally said something closer to [ɲ]. So I can say now that I've heard it pronounced as you indicated, although it would appear that at least among American dialects, that is a fairly rare pronunciation. I'm going to go ahead and reformat that article leaving your example, but adding a note that it varies between dialects, and if you can think of anything to add beyond that, it would be appreciated.

<dd>Maybe then something like your dictionary's full explanation would be good. One of the points of the language examples is, besides giving a survey of usage, helping readers who are not familiar with the phonetic terms recognize what it is they are reading about. Perhaps even something at the top, right after the IPA and XSAMPA symbols, explaining to English speakers that if they speak the word canyon with the emphasis on...they will likely be pronouncing this consonant or a good approximation. And with this kind of expansion, I don't see any problems with the change you suggested.

<p>Just a note to say, first, that I appreciate your taking the time to convert some of the many SAMPA phonetic transcriptions to IPA.</p>
<p>I would ask, however, that you avoid non-rhotic transcriptions. Non-rhotic dialects are phonologically innovative, and more complex, than rhotic English. Learners of English as a foreign language, the chief audience for phonetic transcriptions, should not be taught to imitate them. More importantly, they are rule-bound, and the non-rhotic pronunciation can be derived simply from a rhotic transcription by the application of simple derivational rules; so those whose speech is non-rhotic can figure out their local pronunciation from a full transcription.

<dd>Oh for heaven's sake. Just as both British and American spellings are acceptable, so are both rhotic and nonrhotic pronunciations. I'd suggest only using RP for nonrhotic transcriptions, though, not other nonrhotic accents like Australian. I'd also suggest following the same guidelines for pronunciation as for spelling: rhotic pronunciations on American topics, nonrhotic pronunciations on British/European/Commonwealth topics, and both for region-neutral topics. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> 12:37, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll just add that I disagree with Smerdis of Tlön. Are ESL students really the cheif audience for phonetic/phonemic transcriptions? I doubt it but even if they are, they're not the only audience. Should they not be taught non-rhotic English? Why not? On the contrary, a non-rhotic ESL teacher should be teaching non-rhotic English (&amp; a rhotic one, rhotic English). Neither one is better than the other. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimp_bb44.html" title="User:Jimp">Jimp</a> 19Jun05</dd>

PS - there seems to be something up with the edit function on your talk page... The wrong section opens up when you go to edit a section...</p>
<dl>
<dd>No problems as far as the stub is concerned - it's largely a courtesy to discuss things first, since it's the stub sorters who use the templates more than anyone else. This one <i>will</i> be useful - it's mainly when people start creating stub categories which will only ever have four or five articles in them, or ones which don't fit in with existing categories (by design or chance yours fits in well with things like canada-gov-stub). A to the edit problem, I'm not sure what's causing it - I just know that clicking on a section edit brings up the previous section.

<p>Even more apologies for a delay in responding, but I've been away dealing with a family crisis. I use <a href="http://kohl.wikimedia.org/~kate/cgi-bin/count_edits.cgi" class="external text" title="http://kohl.wikimedia.org/~kate/cgi-bin/count_edits.cgi" rel="nofollow">Kate's tool</a> for monitoring my edit count when I am getting near to a landmark. You can work it out for past milestones by going through your 'My contributions' link; setting the number of articles to 500; and then repeatedly hitting the 'next 500' link. When you get to the end, then you keep reducing the number of articles displayed and paging through until you're showing the last 20. Setting the article count back to 500 will show the last 500 articles, and so the first article displayed is your 500th edit. You can then select 'previous 500' to find the later milestones. Apparently this puts a heavy load on the servers, so it's not really something to be recommended. Hope that helps. <a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoisy_bc7b.html" title="User:Noisy">Noisy</a> | <a href="../../../n/o/i/User_talk%7ENoisy_7db1.html" title="User talk:Noisy">Talk</a> 13:46, May 24, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>On my talk page, you've asked how Danes would pronounce your name. I'm a Dane, but I'm not good at phonetics. Anyway, here's a suggestion:</p>
<p>"Axel" or "Aksel" is old norse, probably meaning "gods helmet". It is pronounced much as in English. The A is perhaps more open like in British "bath", and the E is almost silent ("ahksl").</p>
<p>"Skovdam" means "forest ´pond", I guess. "Sko" is pronounced as in the word "Scotch"; "ov" is like a diphtong "ou" (and also like the Danish word "og", meaning "and"). In "dam", the A is like that in "Axel", but shorter and with auxilliary stress only. So it is quite short and open compared to the A in English "dam" or "damn".</p>
<p>Hope this helps.--<a href="../../../n/o/e/User%7ENoe_b8ad.html" title="User:Noe">Niels Ø</a> 17:39, May 26, 2005 (UTC)</p>

You got rid of the "d with a dot below it" in the <i>"the correct title is..."</i> message and replaced it with (what I assume is) the same character the message warns users about. I can't even confirm this as my perspective looks like the following:<br />
[[Image:Ridvan_article.gif|center]] (deleted)<br />

<p>Ok well it still does not look much different, (I still have empty squares in place of the <b>ḍ</b>'s) so I will have to take your word for it as I'm not really at liberty to download <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firefox.html" title="Firefox">Firefox</a> on the computer I'm using at the moment. (I do most of my wikipedia use/contribution at work—night shift at a hotel gets boring.) I have heard positive comments about Firefox and do plan to get it on my home computer soon. I don't, however, think my bosses (less computer-literate than me, even) would even notice if I added extra font sets/unicode (or whatever) to the hotel computer. And then perhaps I would be able to view it properly in MSIE. Can you give me at a URL from which I can download the stuff I'd need to view it in IE?<br />
Also, I'm sure I'm not the only one having this problem, so is there an existing template message that says something to the effect of <i>"If your system does not properly display some of the characters on this page, you might consider installing extra font-sets from _____."</i>? I think that would be helpful to a large portion of wikipedia users.<br />
Lastly, regarding firefox, I did have one person tell me it's kinda futile to install a 2nd web browser on a windows system because internet explorer is built into the system (I know explorer <i>is</i> used for displaying contents of local folders, etc.) Is firefox capable of completely replacing explorer for all tasks?<br />
I realize this last question has little to do with wikipedia but I've been wondering this for a while, whether IE can be completely gotten rid of at that point or whether it will maintain a permanant and largely redundant (hard drive- and RAM-consuming) presence even after firefox is installed.<br />
A lot of questions, I know. Thanks in advance for advice on this.</p>

<p>Hello there, saw your edit to the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Category%7EAustralian_Wikipedians_5a09.html" title="Category:Australian Wikipedians">Category:Australian Wikipedians</a> cat, with reference to the page that <i>it is supposed to be replacing</i>. It would be much more helpful to start making the subcategories for the Australian Wikipedians category (such as Australian Administrators, Wikipedians in Australia Capital Territory, etc.) and help make the transition rather than provide a link back to the system that is being overwritten. The English Wikipedia is one of the only ones sill using large lists to categorize users instead of categories, which have shown to work a lot better despite lack of annotation (which should be reserved for the respective users' page anyhow). Thoughts on this? If you want to help, please do! The project goal is to replace the subpage lists of the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedians_0c31.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedians">Wikipedia:Wikipedians</a> article with categories: <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedians_94a6.html" title="Category:Wikipedians">Category:Wikipedians</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedians_by_location_48fb.html" title="Category:Wikipedians by location">Category:Wikipedians by location</a>.

<p>Hey. When adding categories to users' pages, it would be helpful if the edit summary included a link back to the project page, so that the user would both see what's going on and possibly even help. The one suggested by the project page (which I admit I wrote there) is [[Wikipedia:User categorisation|User categorisation]]. Other projects tend to do this a lot to gain attention. If it's annoying to copy between two things (both the category tag and the edit summary), then autocomplete in the edit summary textbox can be helpful (though personally I just copy between two <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firefox.html" title="Firefox">Firefox</a> tabs). <a href="../../../p/e/e/User%7EPeepP_d947.html" title="User:PeepP">PeepP</a> 19:48, July 31, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just a minor point - you removed the spacing on the IPA transcriptions. Isn't spacing a customary device to indicate syllabification? They are harder to read otherwise.

The policy on naming conventions specifically allows for the exception I and others are proposing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>EXCEPTIONS: When individuals received hereditary peerages after retiring from the post of Prime Minister (unless they are better known for their later career under an additional/alternative title), or for any other reason are known <b>exclusively</b> by their personal names, do not include the peerage dignity.

<dd>You're an English speaker who happens to have read up on phonetics, but that's not particularly common among English speakers. The transcription, however, is not phonetic, it's phone<b>m</b>ic and /g/ represents a devoiced [g] and sounds more or less identical to the unaspirated [k] in English. I don't know why you'd want people to pronounce your name in Danish, though, since you're an English speaker living in an English-speaking country and by deductive logic, you obviously don't pronounce it that way yourself. However, if you want to do it properly, you should first of all put it in brackets and make it narrow. The transcription might then be something like this: <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[aksl̩ sg̊oʊ̯ˀd̥am]]</span>. I think you should use the transcription of how <i>you</i> pronounce it, though.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>And that is what I've done! The &lt;k&gt; sounds very much like a voiceless /g/ rather than a /k/. I've used the transcription of how I <i>want</i> my name pronounced, OK.

Although, if you feel it's really necessary to have a separate roads stub for roads in Australia, then I won't object to you retagging those articles with {{Australia-road-stub}}. – <a href="../../../a/x/s/User%7EAxSkov_dc6f.html" title="User:AxSkov">AxSkov</a> (<big><a href="../../../a/x/s/User_talk%7EAxSkov_04ac.html" title="User talk:AxSkov">☏</a></big>) <small>04:09, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p>I guess my view is that since there's a more specific stub category, I'd use it, the same as putting articles in the most specific available category. Maybe one day someone will make a point of working through all our roads and expanding them to full articles. I just wanted to make sure you weren't in the process of deliberately emptying the category or something. I might sort all Aus roads back into the Australian stub category, or even expand some, sometime this week then.

<p>Hi there, when trying to go over the discussion at <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_invasion_of_Iraq_768c.html" title="2003 invasion of Iraq">2003 invasion of Iraq</a> I saw it has become a big mess. If I see it correctly there was a conflict between an anon and others and now the page has been blocked. I think the anon had a point that an encyclopedia article about any military conflict should not be written exclusively by three members of one the conflicting parties, in this case <a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPookster11_83f2.html" title="User:Pookster11">Pookster11</a>, <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester">Swatjester</a>, and Dawgknot who according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Swatjester&amp;diff=37724658&amp;oldid=37635000" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Swatjester&amp;diff=37724658&amp;oldid=37635000" rel="nofollow">this comment</a> all belong to the US military. I therefore suggest to get more people into the boat, that should take the wind out of the sails of bias allegations. As I saw you also edited on that page, would you be willing to help out? <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGet-back-world-respect_c406.html" title="User:Get-back-world-respect">Get-back-world-respect</a> 22:24, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
