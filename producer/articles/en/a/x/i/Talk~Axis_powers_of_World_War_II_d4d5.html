<p>It could be said, that up to Operation Barbarossa, the Soviet Union was part of the Axis. They invaded eastern Poland and was cooperating with the Germans until 22 June 1941. I think this article should reflect that. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_monkeyhate_eddd.html" title="User:The monkeyhate">The monkeyhate</a> 11:50, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Relations between countries were quite shallow in the 1930s. For example, the Nazis had good relations with <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chiang_Kai-Shek_4a54.html" title="Chiang Kai-Shek">Chiang Kai-Shek</a> until 1941 and condemned the <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nanjing_Massacre_c0d3.html" title="Nanjing Massacre">Nanjing Massacre</a>. No one would say that China was part of the Axis though. The Soviets offered to support Czechoslovakia in 1936 but lacked a common land border and were obstructed by Romania. Britain, France and Poland co-operated in the partition of Czechosloakia but no one in their right mind would say they were part of the Axis. The Soviets supported the democratically-elected Spanish government in the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Civil_War_7a30.html" title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a> against Germany and Italy, while no other state did anything. Stalin had idiotically <a href="../../../c/a/s/Case_of_Trotskyist_Anti-Soviet_Military_Organization_6089.html" title="Case of Trotskyist Anti-Soviet Military Organization">gutted his own officer corps in 1937</a> and needed some breathing space in which to rebuild the Red Army.

<dd>Staberinde, the Molotov-Ribbendrop pact would not have happened if Britain and France had been prepare to work with Stalin before 1939. But they weren't. The Soviets were't ready for war with German in 1939 --- they weren't even ready in mid-1941 -- so the pact was a matter of survival. If there were any evidence that the Soviets had the same intention in invading Poland that Germany did, then I would be inclined to agree with you. By invading Poland, <i>after the German invasion</i>, the Soviets ensured that the Germans were several hundred kilometres further from the Soviet border than they would have been otherwise. I would compare the Soviet invasion to the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Timor_%281942-43%29_fff1.html" title="Battle of Timor (1942-43)">Australian-Dutch invasion of Portuguese Timor</a> in 1942. Had the Portuguese or Timorese put up any resistance then the Australians and Dutch would also have been placed in the position of killing people in a war of aggression. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">Talk</a> 14:54, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>USSR were not a member of the Axis. It was a separate military action and was treated as such by the allies. Even though their actions were condemned by the Allies there was no aggression between the Allies and the USSR. If the USSR had been considered at the time to be members of the Axis then France and Britain would have declared war on the USSR as well as on Germany. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonank_3a4a.html" title="User:Ronank">Ronank</a> 17:59, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Grant, Australian-Dutch invasion of Portuguese Timor in 1942 is no way compareable with soviet invasion of Poland. Portugese Timor was small practically undefended colony, Poland was at that time probably 5th or 6th in strenght at Europe. Also I really can't understand your logic. Molotov-Ribbendrop pact itsselfly very well proves Stalin's intentions to invade Poland from east. And pact clearly wasn't matter of survival for USSR as Hitler was not in position to fight 2 front war at 1939(even his capabilities for 1 front war were quite limited).</dd>
<dd>Rorank, Allies also didn't declare war on Spain and Denmark.(if i remember correctly they even never declared war on Vichy france). Still we have those countries in article.--<a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStaberinde_11e6.html" title="User:Staberinde">Staberinde</a> 18:44, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Staberinde, (1) There was no way for the Australians or Dutch to know for sure how the local population would react. Some Timorese hold Australia partly responsible for the 40-70,000 Timorese killed by the Japanese. Some Australians agree. The similarities are there. (2) You say: "pact clearly wasn't matter of survival for USSR as Hitler was not in position to fight 2 front war at 1939". He wasn't fighting on <i>any</i> front at all when the pact was signed. I would submit that <i><a href="../../../l/e/b/Lebensraum.html" title="Lebensraum">lebensraum</a></i> was the major objective for the Nazis and war with Britain and France was a major inconvenience, albeit one which they thought could be overcome. Stalin was many things but he was not a fool and was not blind to this. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">Talk</a> 04:25, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Then Stalin and Hitler divided eastern-europe with Molotov-Ribbendrop pact there was no war in europe, Poland was not yet invaded, USSR and Germany didn't have any common border, France and UK were not ready to allow Germnay into Poland, Poland itsselfly was quite big country. Portugese timor was small weakly defended colony which was on the way of already fastly advanceing japan. Completely uncompareable situations.--<a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStaberinde_11e6.html" title="User:Staberinde">Staberinde</a> 10:14, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While we are on the subject, we might also mention the hostilities between Japan and the Soviets in 1938-39. Another reason why they were not prepared for a war in the west in September 1939.</p>
<p>Yes, there was a big difference between Poland's forces and the Portuguese forces in Timor; that is irrelevant in terms of why the Soviet and Australian-Dutch invasions of those countries occurred. It was only because of Portugals's military weakness in Asia, and the previously friendly relations between the Portuguese and their invaders that a Poland-type situation did not emerge.</p>
<p>And the fact remains that the USSR did not make any of the direct contributions that Spain, Denmark (etc) did to contribute to the Nazi war effort. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">Talk</a> 02:27, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>USSR invasion of Poland was direct contribution to nazi war effort, it probably was more importnant then Danish and Spanish contributions combined.

<dd>A trade agreement isn't a military alliance. By that measure Sweden's iron and access to its railways made it Germany's most important "ally".

<p>I will make one last atempt to convince you that Portugese timor and poland can't be compared(it probably fails but atleast i will try). Portugese timor was small weakly defended colony of a neutral country, allies occupied it to prevent japanese landing there. Allied forces which occupied it fought aganist advanceing japanese. Now poland was attacked by soviet union in full agreement with germany. USSR and Germany cooperated during invasion, for example Lwow was under german siege but after soviet invasion German troops handed operations over to their new Soviet allies. Soviet invasion made polish <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanian_Bridgehead_e873.html" title="Romanian Bridgehead">Romanian Bridgehead</a> plan useless. Also Nazis and Soviets had joint victory parade in Brest. 250,000 to 450,000 Polish soldiers were taken prisoner of war by the Soviets. Completely different situations, in Timor allies occupied portugese territory to avoid japanese occupation of area, in poland USSR fully cooperated with Germany in destroying polish resistance, agreement for divideing poland had been made already with Molotov-ribbendrop pact.--<a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStaberinde_11e6.html" title="User:Staberinde">Staberinde</a> 12:22, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i><b>That the Russian armies should stand on this line was clearly necessary for the safety of Russia against the Nazi menace. At any rate, the line is there, and an Eastern Front has been created which Nazi Germany does not dare assail.</b></i> (W. Churchill, 1939.) It seems he was not too disappointed with this fact and did not see it as a help for Germany. The parade in Brest was not victory parade but a parade dedicated to replacing German administration with Soviet one. Allies' forces had many such "joint" parades in the Western Front with German forces when Germans surrendered. One can even find photos where British soldiers stay on a parade along with Germans, which does not give right to claim Britain to be ally of Germany.--<a href="../../../n/i/x/User%7ENixer_51c2.html" title="User:Nixer">Nixer</a> 20:38, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>National security makes for difficult and controversial decisions. As I have alluded with the case of Portuguese Timor, there are "invasions" and there are invasions. The U.K. and U.S. occupied Iceland. The Allies were not technically at war with Vichy France but still attacked forces on numerous occasions, such as the controversial <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attack_on_Mers-el-K%C3%A9bir_4642.html" title="Attack on Mers-el-Kébir">Attack on Mers-el-Kébir</a>.

<dd>I disagree. Norway should be included here, but solely because of Quisling's puppet government. Quisling gave name to the collaborators and it is still used today. The inclusion should have nothing to do with legitemacy of the government, but historical importance. (Well, Quisling's government didn't have practically any other importancy but this naming thing...) The cold fact is that Quisling's government is well known name around the world.

<dl>
<dd>I can help answer this. 'co-belligerent' was the term chosen months ago to describe the situation in Finland. Finland was initially supportive of the German war effort in the region because Finland itself was at war with the Soviet Union. However, this support was purely based on the logic that Finland's own existance was threatened by the war so from a strategic point of view it made sense. Finland later switched sides and fought the Germans. This has been debated before and there is a lot more to it than what I just wrote. But it is this complicated situation that we chose the term 'co-belligerent' to describe. The fact that other nations were later added under that section of the article is frankly still unclear to me since that section of the article was created to describe the unique and to this day very sensitive situation in Finland at the time. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 08:56, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

Although Finland was <i>de facto</i> ally of Germany, it wasn't allied <i>de jure</i> due to ideological differencies.

<p>I just read the discussion about Denmark in the archives for this page (one of the most informative content debates I've ever read on WP, by the way) and have come to the conclusion that Denmark should be listed, along with Vichy France and Independent Croatia, as a collaborator state of the Axis. The conditions under which Vichy is classified as a collaborator are similar to Denmark's. I don't see any reason to change the text of the Denmark section, it's fairly well-written and NPOV, just the heading should be changed to list it as one of the collaborator states. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7ECla68_4b38.html" title="User:Cla68">Cla68</a> 02:44, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I concur with Cla68. It does not make any sense to make up a heading "The case of..." when Denmark clearly collaborated with Germany. It should be included with the other collaborator states.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I've restored the heading that was agreed to after a very long debate. You consider the case to be closely related to the case of France. Noted, but such a conclusion is strongly disputed by many Danish historians who see clear differences between Denmark and France. The quote I mentioned from Lidegaard could be backed up with others of the same nature, and the term "collaborator state" is definitely incorrect for the 1943-45 period.

<dd>I agree again that Norway does not belong on this list. This has been discussed at lenght and been decided, but new participants should be alowed to vent their opinons anyway. Illythr reverted and stated "<i>Norway wasn't a full-fledged Axis power. That is why it is listed in as a "German puppet state" along with Serbia and Italy.</i>" Norway wasn't even a partial Axis power. It was occupied by Germany and administered by the German occupants. In order to calm the Norwegians down a bit a mock governmant was installed with Quisling given the quasi-title of ministerpresident. This institution had no power to act without consent from the German occupants and was trusted with few areas of government. Norway did not in any way participate in the war on the Axis side. The occupants extracted resources from Norway as they did with all other occupied territories, but also spent considerable resources occupying it. Some individual Norwegians enlisted in volunteer units established by the German military. Individuals from virtually every European country did the same. This does not make Norway an Axis power. As this topic has reached consensus before I will remove Norway again.

That is a good solution and one that I have advocated on other articles as well. However, in this case we need to draw a line somehwere. There was a time where Belgium was also added along with Luxemburg for very obscure reasons. This article should not include countries whose status during the war was never questioned. I think the best way to do this would be to refer the reader to the <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quisling.html" title="Quisling">Quisling</a> article.

Also, it refers other collaborationist movements as <i>Quislings</i>, which makes even more important to provide factual information about it somewhere. <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norway_during_World_War_II_1db9.html" title="Norway during World War II">Norway during World War II</a> is a little better, but it also dances around the question about the nature of Quisling regime. --<a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhiskey_76ec.html" title="User:Whiskey">Whiskey</a> 15:19, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quisling.html" title="Quisling">Quisling</a> and other articles does need improvement, but are the more suitable places to inform people on this subject. As Martin pointed out we need to draw the line somewhere. I believe the line runs somewhere just north of the Danish border (not literaly:)). I was a bit hesitant to go for including it, but there were some strong points for it. The solution reached there was a good one. But I don't think we should go further. I am sure there are someone out there who might argue that almost every European country merits some mention or paragraph in this article. Should we then preemtively create paragraphs for them? Norway, Belgium, Luxemburg definately fall into the exclude category even if they might be readded by passers by from time to time. A general collaborators section might be a good idea though. Espeshially if it is handled in the same professional manner as the Denmark case. On the other hand we already have <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-German_cooperation_with_Nazis_during_World_War_II_647c.html" title="Non-German cooperation with Nazis during World War II">Non-German cooperation with Nazis during World War II</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collaboration_during_World_War_II_8c5c.html" title="Collaboration during World War II">Collaboration during World War II</a>.<a href="../../../i/n/g/User%7EInge_1e43.html" title="User:Inge">Inge</a> 16:25, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Bulgarian Navy fought several skirmishes against the Soviet Black Sea Fleet and sank at least one Soviet submarine. The Soviet submarine was Shch-204 "Minoga" (sank 06.12.1941 30km off Varna harbour near cape Emine during attack against Bulgarian/Romanian convoy. It was found by Bulgarian trawler in 1983) Several sources mention that submarine was heavily damaged by depth charges from Bulgarian patrol boats "Belomoretz" and "Chernomoretz" (built in USA in 1918 for France, purchased by Bulgaria in 1922), broke surface and was destroyed by artillery fire from Bulgarian patrol boats.</p>

<p>Several Soviet submarines also exploded on seamines near Bulgarian coast - those were at least S-34 (11.1941 - cape Emine), Shch-211 (11.1941 - cape St. Atanas, it was found in 2000 by Bulgarian divers). Soviet submarines also sank several Bulgarian merchant ships - these included refrigerator ship "Shipka" (2304 GRT, sank by L-4 type submarine 15.09.1941), small transport ship "Struma" (275 GRT, sunk by submarine Shch-213 24.02.1942), schooner (scuttled by boarding party from the submarine Shch-214 02.06.1942), schooner "Vita" (240 GRT, sunk by submarine Shch-215 24.08.1944). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKurt_Leyman_1ee7.html" title="User:Kurt Leyman">Kurt Leyman</a> (<a href="../../../k/u/r/User_talk%7EKurt_Leyman_a617.html" title="User talk:Kurt Leyman">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kurt_Leyman_d4d8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kurt Leyman">contribs</a>) 18:01, 22 February 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

Seems that RED is for Russian controlled Allied Power countries, and BLUE is all the other Allies... BLACK is obviously the Axis Power controlled countries. But what's up with this key? It's got a bunch of shades of green and orange/brown, but none of the actually relevant colors.</p>
