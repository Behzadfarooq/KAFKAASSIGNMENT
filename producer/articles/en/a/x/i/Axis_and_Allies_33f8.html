Milton Bradley released Axis &amp; Allies as part of their <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gamemaster_%28board_game_series%29.html" title="Gamemaster (board game series)">Gamemaster</a> series in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>, and it was the most successful of the five. In <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_2004.html" title="April 2004">April 2004</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasbro.html" title="Hasbro">Hasbro</a> released the Revised Edition under the <a href="../../../a/v/a/Avalon_Hill_d3a2.html" title="Avalon Hill">Avalon Hill</a> name. In all of the editions of the core game, up to five players can take control of one of the Axis (<a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> or <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>) or Allied (<a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">UK</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> or <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">USA</a>) nations. The object of the game is to win the war by capturing enough critical territories.</p>
<p><i>Axis &amp; Allies</i> is not a strict historical <a href="../../../w/a/r/Wargame.html" title="Wargame">wargame</a>, due to its streamlining for ease of play and balancing so that both sides have a chance. For instance, the economic model is simplistic, with each territory producing a number of "IPCs" (Industrial Production Certificates) good toward the purchase of any unit. Moreover, the game is supposed to start in the spring of <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a>, but Japan is immediately in position to attack <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawaii.html" title="Hawaii">Hawaii</a> again, while Germany is pressed well into the USSR with an initially superior force. Another significant difference is that the Soviet Union and Japan are opponents at the start of the game; historically, they did not go to war with each other until 1945. If the game were truer to history, the Axis empires would be at their apex at this time, about to be pushed back home – but, of course, that would not be a very competitive match.</p>

<p>Each side's objective is to conquer enemy territory, achieving victory by holding two enemy national capitals; the Axis can also win an "economic victory" by gaining enough territory, which is more common in practice due to the difficulty of attacking Britain or Eastern United States.</p>
<p>Each player progresses in order: USSR, Germany, UK, Japan, USA. On each turn, the player declares IPC spending for production and research (which gives a random chance to enhance units). The player then declares combat moves (using <a href="../../../a/r/e/Area_movement.html" title="Area movement">area movement</a>), attacking enemy-held territory. Much of the playtime is spent resolving battles. Each round, all the attacking and defending units get a chance to hit once. A unit scores a hit if the player rolls, with a six-sided die, a number less than or equal to the unit's attack or defense score (e.g., <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infantry.html" title="Infantry">infantry</a> makes a better defender than attacker). Each player gets to choose how to distribute casualties amongst his or her own units and removes them from the battlefield. (This provision makes it practical to bring cheap <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannon_fodder.html" title="Cannon fodder">cannon fodder</a> units along to soak up hits.) The battle continues until either force is destroyed or the attacker withdraws.</p>
<p>After all battles are concluded, the player takes noncombat actions: moving <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reinforcement.html" title="Reinforcement">reinforcements</a>, landing aircraft, etc. Then he deploys units purchased at the beginning of the turn in territories with an industrial complex and finally collects income from all occupied territories to end the turn.</p>
<p>This cycle continues until, after USA's turn, the victory conditions are met for one side.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/x/i/Axis_and_Allies_33f8.html" title="Edit section: Revised Edition">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Revised Edition</span></h2>
<p>To revise the original game, <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Selinker_e4bd.html" title="Mike Selinker">Mike Selinker</a> led a design team that included <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Harris_%28game_designer%29_2a49.html" title="Larry Harris (game designer)">Larry Harris</a>, designer of the first edition. The revision aimed to address some major concerns with the original and make the game more fun. Selinker also wrote a series of <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=ah/article/ah20031205a" class="external text" title="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=ah/article/ah20031205a" rel="nofollow">articles</a> describing the changes.</p>
<p>The overarching change is in the victory condition. To win in the original, either side could seize two enemy capitals, but the Axis could also win an economic victory by capturing enough resources. This rule gave the poorer Axis a leg up, but led to anticlimactic endings. Also, it often took many, many turns to finally capture heavily fortified capital territories. The designers scrapped this rule and implemented <i>victory cities</i>, where each side starts with 6 of the 12 cities. In addition to the national capitals, these include <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a>, and <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Petersburg_5667.html" title="Saint Petersburg">Leningrad</a> in <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calcutta.html" title="Calcutta">Calcutta</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shanghai.html" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>, and <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manila.html" title="Manila">Manila</a> in <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a>, and <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> in <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a>. With this rule, players can decide what constitutes victory at the start – playing only to 8 victory cities makes for a shorter game, while more skilled players can play until one side controls all of them. <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Another important change concerns unit capabilities and statistics. In the original, <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infantry.html" title="Infantry">infantry</a> were a cheap unit and turned out to be most useful as cannon fodder, by taking hits that would otherwise destroy more valuable units. This tended to lead to massive buildups by players amassing stacks of infantry in neighboring territories, unable to do anything other than buy more infantry, which can be ineffective attacking units by themselves due to their minimal attack value. While infantry were left unchanged in the revised edition, the <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tank.html" title="Tank">tank</a> unit defense was increased to encourage players to use <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combined_arms.html" title="Combined arms">combined arms</a> rather than just rely on infantry, and to balance the value and effectiveness of comparable groups of infantry and tanks. <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> Other changes include the addition of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artillery.html" title="Artillery">artillery</a> units, which increase the attack of attacking infantry, <a href="../../../d/e/s/Destroyer.html" title="Destroyer">destroyers</a>, which negate the first-shot advantage of <a href="../../../s/u/b/Submarine.html" title="Submarine">subs</a>, and a significant increase in the usefulness and effectiveness of transports and amphibious assaults, by allowing transports to carry any one land unit plus one additional infantry unit.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.wizards.com/avalonhill/images/aabigmap.jpg" class="external text" title="http://www.wizards.com/avalonhill/images/aabigmap.jpg" rel="nofollow">map was also reworked</a>, with a new art style and many gameplay changes. One important change is the fragmentation of Germany's <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Front_%28WWII%29_3ca1.html" title="Eastern Front (WWII)">Eastern Front</a>. The area from Berlin to Moscow now includes many small territories, a victory city (Leningrad), and a strategic industrial complex at the <a href="../../../c/a/u/Caucasus.html" title="Caucasus">Caucasus</a>. This change was designed to encourage more dynamic play in an area that often bogs down into heavy <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fortification.html" title="Fortification">fortification</a>. Another notable change is to the <a href="../../../o/c/e/Oceania.html" title="Oceania">South Pacific</a> region, which now provides much of Japan's starting income and is a much more valuable target for Allied incursion. <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>A new system of optional rules was implemented. Each power has six possible advantages, representing tactics or technologies used in the war. For instance, if the UK has the "<a href="../../../e/n/i/Enigma_machine.html" title="Enigma machine">Enigma</a> Decoded" advantage, it may quickly move units during Germany's turn in response to an attack on UK territory. A number of these advantages can be chosen or randomly picked for each side at the beginning of each game to alter gameplay.</p>
<p>Many other changes are documented in the manual, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/avalonhill/rules/axis2004.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.wizards.com/avalonhill/rules/axis2004.pdf" rel="nofollow">available for download</a> from <a href="../../../a/v/a/Avalon_Hill_d3a2.html" title="Avalon Hill">Avalon Hill</a>.</p>

<p>When <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasbro.html" title="Hasbro">Hasbro</a> acquired the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milton_Bradley_Company_3323.html" title="Milton Bradley Company">Milton Bradley Company</a>, they kept Axis and Allies in print as part of their <a href="../../../a/v/a/Avalon_Hill_d3a2.html" title="Avalon Hill">Avalon Hill</a> lineup, a rather prestigious game company they bought in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>. Under the same brand, they published two follow-up games, <i><a href="../../../e/u/r/Axis_and_Allies%7E_Europe_1a30.html" title="Axis and Allies: Europe">Axis and Allies: Europe</a></i> (<a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>) and <i><a href="../../../p/a/c/Axis_and_Allies%7E_Pacific_04e1.html" title="Axis and Allies: Pacific">Axis and Allies: Pacific</a></i> (<a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>), that were designed by <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Harris_%28game_designer%29_2a49.html" title="Larry Harris (game designer)">Larry Harris</a>, the original designer of Axis and Allies. The latter especially tinkers with the original game mechanics and tries to make the game feel less scripted while keeping the appeal of the original.</p>
<p>Larry Harris also designed the latest expansion game in the series, <i><a href="../../../d/-/d/Axis_and_Allies%7E_D-Day_8a96.html" title="Axis and Allies: D-Day">Axis and Allies: D-Day</a></i> (released <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_2004.html" title="June 2004">June 2004</a>). Based on the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Normandy_a39c.html" title="Battle of Normandy">Allied liberation of France</a>, the game plays at a <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_tactics.html" title="Military tactics">tactical</a> level (rather than a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strategic.html" title="Strategic">strategic</a> one like its predecessors), getting rid of most resource management and using a smaller-scale world. D-Day won a 2005 <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origins_Award_daaf.html" title="Origins Award">Origins Award</a> for Best Historical Board Game. The newest of the series is <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Axis_and_Allies%7E_Battle_of_the_Bulge_e96e.html" title="Axis and Allies: Battle of the Bulge">Axis and Allies: Battle of the Bulge</a></i> published in November 2006. Like <i><a href="../../../d/-/d/Axis_and_Allies%7E_D-Day_8a96.html" title="Axis and Allies: D-Day">Axis and Allies: D-Day</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Axis_and_Allies%7E_Battle_of_the_Bulge_e96e.html" title="Axis and Allies: Battle of the Bulge">Axis and Allies: Battle of the Bulge</a></i> is a standalone, 2-player version of the game focusing on a smaller conflict. <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Axis_and_Allies%7E_Battle_of_the_Bulge_e96e.html" title="Axis and Allies: Battle of the Bulge">Axis and Allies: Battle of the Bulge</a></i> is notable because it features the the biggest departures from the original game, including a hex map, supply rules, and a different combat system.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, Avalon Hill released a line of <a href="../../../m/i/n/Miniatures.html" title="Miniatures">miniatures</a> under the Axis &amp; Allies brand.</p>

<p>Several computer games were also based on Axis &amp; Allies. They include turn based strategy closely based on the board game, while more recently a real time strategy game was based on it. The <a href="../../../r/e/a/Real-time_strategy.html" title="Real-time strategy">real-time strategy (RTS)</a> game includes a mode that is more closely related to the board game, but you can only attack one enemy occupied territory per turn and can either fight battles in RTS mode or have the computer decide the outcome. There is also a campaign mode in which you can fight as the Allies and try to defeat the Axis or be the Axis and try to change history and in the end defeat the Allies. All of the battles in the Campaign mode are fought in the RTS mode.</p>
<p>An open source version of the game called <a href="../../../t/r/i/TripleA_8485.html" title="TripleA">TripleA</a> also exists in which one can play alone or online against other players.</p>
