<p>In the twentieth century, the grand goal of finding a "true" and "universal" set of axioms was shown to be a hopeless dream by <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurt_Godel_dd3c.html" title="Kurt Godel">Gödel</a> and others.</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's not what Gödel showed. &#160;:-) --<a href="../../../l/m/s/User%7ELMS_bc9d.html" title="User:LMS">LMS</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Well, that's a reasonable paraphrase of what he showed, which was that no set of axioms sufficiently large for ordinary mathematics could be both (1) complete, i.e., capable of proving every truth; and (2) consistent, i.e., never proving an untruth. Or to put it yet another way, there must exist some assertions that are true but unprovable. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_Daniel_Crocker_4538.html" title="User:Lee Daniel Crocker">LDC</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Not even that... He showed that any formal system strong enough to have equality, addition, and multiplication, had those properties. (It didn't have to encompass all of ordinary mathematics.) [He also had a loophole that might have allowed non Omega consistant logics to bypass the problems, but Rosser closed that hole. <a href="../../../n/a/h/User%7ENahaj_bfe3.html" title="User:Nahaj">Nahaj</a> 01:57:56, 2005-09-08 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey... I was just following the style guidelines that said that I should leave something hanging! (I still stand be the statement that Incompleteness can be colloquially said to imply that there is no universal and true set of axioms. There are definitely complete and consistent systems such as real arithmetic, but they lack the power of, say, integer arithmetic and thus can be said not to be universal. Another way to read what I was saying is that Principia was a hopeless task and not just because of a few paradoxes that might someday be weaseled around. -- TedDunning</p>
<dl>
<dd>What do you mean by real arithmetic? Not arithmetic of real numbers, surely, because that includes integer arithmetic as a subset and so is just as powerful. -- <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosh_Grosse_d1d0.html" title="User:Josh Grosse">Josh Grosse</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Actually, real arithmetic does not include integer arithmetic as a subset. The reals include the integers, but logical systems built on the two fields are not equivalent. In particular, real arithmetic is generally taken as not including comparison while integer arithmetic has comparison. The exclusion of comparison is generally due to the complexity of the definitions of the reals. The completeness of the real system was proved (I think) by either Banach or Tarski in the middle of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>My own personal view is that Incompleteness is just a guise of the Halting problem. Since you can solve the Halting problem with real arithmetic where the reals are defined using bit-strings and you are allowed to look at and compare a finite prefix of any real. The trick is that the algorithm requires an initial condition that is not a computable real (TANSTAAFL!) -- TedDunning</p>

<dd>That remark seems very silly. The only "Liddell and Scott" I've been able to find is a lexicon translating ancient Greek words into English. They would therefore be expected to write about what the word meant in Ancient Greek, <i>not</i> about what it means in the usage of modern mathematicians. Liddell and Scott are probably right, and the statement you quote above about use in mathematics is also right. They do not contradict each other; they are about two different things. Liddell and Scott do not appear to be mathematicians and cannot be supposed to have expertise in that area. I, on the other hand, am a mathematician, and I am quite familiar with both usages. I suggest you read the <i>whole</i> Wikipedia article, and you will see that there is no contradiction between these points. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 22:33, 12 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>L-S is about first-order theories, and this axiomization isn't one. You can come up with a first-order theory of all first-order sentences true of the real numbers using the ring functions of addition and multiplication, as well as the order relation, and then L-S would apply, and would tell us it has a countable model. We get the theory of formally real fields in this way, but not the real numbers uniquely. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Ward_Smith_f812.html" title="User:Gene Ward Smith">Gene Ward Smith</a> 08:01, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article now claims:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic theories, such as arithmetic, real analysis (sometimes referred to as the theory of functions of one real variable), linear algebra, and complex analysis (a.k.a. complex variables), are often introduced non-axiomatically in mostly technical studies, but any rigorous course in these subjects always begins by presenting its axioms.</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems to me this just isn't true. Most often, what is done instead is to present definitions inside of set theory, and the set theory used is normally naive set theory. Linear algebra uses axioms when it wants to talk about vector spaces over arbitary fields, but that is quite different than using axioms to define the integers, real numbers, or complex numbers. If this sentence isn't given a good defense I'll remove it. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Ward_Smith_f812.html" title="User:Gene Ward Smith">Gene Ward Smith</a> 19:34, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
