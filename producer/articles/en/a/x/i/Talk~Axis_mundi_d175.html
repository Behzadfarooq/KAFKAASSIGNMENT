<p>To my knowledge there is not the concept of axis mundi widely accepted in buddhism. In any case bodhi trees are not considered to possess any such metaphysical significance, it's simply the tree under which Buddha happened to have gained enlightenment. I have thus removed the reference to bodhi trees as the axis mundi in buddhism.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It seems implausible to think of the location of the Buddha's enlightenment as being a mere incidental detail. The name of the tree provides the very name of the Buddha, after all. It is, I think, a mistake to think of details in mythology as incidental by-the-ways. These symbols are rich and full of significance.
<dl>
<dd>I'm a little confused by your comment that the Bodhi tree "provides the very name of the Buddha, after all," given that <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddha.html" title="Buddha">Buddha</a> is simply Sanskrit or Prakrit for "awakened one," and <a href="../../../b/o/d/Bodhi.html" title="Bodhi">Bodhi</a> is Sanskrit or Prakrit for "awakening." Really, the life of the Buddha "provides the name of the Bodhi tree," if anything. That said, maybe the Bodhi tree does serve a psychological role analogous to the Axis Mundi in indigenous religions (though I'm not very familiar with the concept behind Axis Mundi.) Is the role of the Bodhi tree as being analogous to the Axis Mundi of other religions commonly accepted among experts?</dd>

<p>- I'm not aware of a World Tree in Buddhism, despite the importance of trees in symbolism. That said, I would not want to see a "World Tree" article combined with "Axis Mundi," as the Axis Mundi is one version of a "World Tree" myth archetype. That would be like combining combining the article on the "Trickster" archetype with the article on "Loki." Several cultures have a World Tree-like myth, including the Mayans, which is enough reason to see one article about World Trees in general, and seporate articles about individual myths like the Mayan tree. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevingarcia_7e7c.html" title="User:Kevingarcia">Kevingarcia</a> 22:35, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>imo you've got it backwards here- the axis mundi is not one version of the world tree, but the world tree is one version of the axis mundi archetype. the axis mundi manifests as a staff, a tree, a vine, a ladder, etc in various cultures; it is what ties the worlds together and that through which one travels between the worlds. accordingly, it would seem that the world tree, one form of this, is in fact a subset of axis mundi. so it would be more like putting <a href="../../../l/o/k/Loki.html" title="Loki">loki</a> into <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trickster.html" title="Trickster">trickster</a> than trickster into loki.</dd>
<dd>although i don't have strong feelings either way regarding the merger, the world tree article does sort of seem unecessary. Sort of like having an article on "Hungarian trickster myths". On the other hand, if the article can be more than a list and more than a simple redundancy of what is in this article, then it should stand on its own- as should hungarian trickster myths, were that the case.</dd>

<dd>At the same time, you could hardly call the Mayan tree a version of the Greek Axis Mundi. Because the name "Axis Mundi" is Greek in origin and refers to a Greek myth, I would not use it as the base term (unless all other trees were inspired by the Greek original). Because that is not the case, I would rather use a region-nuetral term like "World Tree" to refer to similar myths in different and unrelated parts of the world. Similarly the Great Flood page ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deluge_%28mythology%29" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deluge_%28mythology%29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deluge_%28mythology%29</a> ) is not called "the Genesis Flood" or "Noah's Flood" because it refers to more than just the Judeo-Christian story. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevingarcia_7e7c.html" title="User:Kevingarcia">Kevingarcia</a> 22:35, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't understand the connection between the language of the term and the cultural-specificity of the term that you are making. Using your logic, wouldn't "World Tree" or "Great Flood" only be applicable to versions from English-speaking cultures? BTW, "axis mundi" appears to be Latin in origin from the period when the initial scholarship was done, though we could certainly move it to "world axis" if that appears to be a consensus, though "axis mundi" certainly seems to be the more common version. It is thus not a case of Greek vs Mayan, but if the world tree cosmological concept is a subset of the world axis cosmological concept. From everything I know of the subject, admittedly being no expert, the answer is yes. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">Tree</a> 23:34, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fair enough. I can't claim to speak either Latin or Greek (and after I'd signed off the computer it donned on me that I called a Latin phrase "Greek"). My point though was not the language but religious connotations. My understanding - and I am no expert either - was that the term "axis mundi" came from a pre-Christian belief in Europe, one of those brought from Greece into Rome. "World Tree" is certainly an English phrase, but is not directly connected to any faith in that sense. It is a phrase used by later researches to describe concepts from various older religions. My basic question though is: does the phrase "axis mundi" properly describe Wacah Chan and Yggdrasil? <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevingarcia_7e7c.html" title="User:Kevingarcia">Kevingarcia</a> 03:59, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Axis mundi is a academic term. I first came across it in a survey course of world relgion reading <a href="../../../m/i/r/Mircea_Eliade_f0a3.html" title="Mircea Eliade">Mircea Eliade</a>. It is not connected with any particular culture or region, as is clear from the article. If you wish to use as the basis of your argument that "axis mundi" refers only to some specific region, I would need to see sources that state this, as I reject the assertion on its face.</dd>
<dd>Within Europe, the Middle East, and India it appears to have originated in the hypothetical <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proto-Indo-European_religion_3fd2.html" title="Proto-Indo-European religion">Proto-Indo-European religion</a> of the early bronze age, way before the Greeks emerged. However, there are numerous examples that independently emerged throughout the world, as is clear fromthe article. The world tree that shows up as Yggdrassil, Jievaras, and other world trees originates with this earlier religion. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">Tree</a> 13:17, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I just want to agree. I too know about the term through Eliade and it's not merely representing the Greek mythology. It's representing a concept of religious philosophy/sociology/reality. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/i/m/Wikipedia%7ELimited_administrators_6c2e.html" title="Wikipedia:Limited administrators">?</a></sup> 05:17, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I submit to your valid points. I still feel that non-Western cultures should be included in any World Tree/Axis Mundi article, but the title of the article, clearly, could go either way.

<p>I understand what you mean about shamanic practices, but it is wrong to say it plays a more excplicit role with indigineous peoples. The statment doesn't make any sense, indigineous peoples is just a term to connote a group of people who were native to a given land, without any reference to the area you are talking about there is no such thing as indigineous. The indigineous peoples of some areas do not even have shamanic practices.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 00:27, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I also understand your point, but i think people understand what is meant when the term "indigenous peoples" is used here. Saying something like "primitives" would perhaps more properly denote what is meant, but of course there's a million reasons we can't use that word.</dd>
<dd>For lack of a proper word, perhaps the "indigenous" reference can simply be left out? ie, "often plays a more explicit role in cultures with <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animism.html" title="Animism">animist</a> backgrounds and/or utilizing <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shamanism.html" title="Shamanism">shamanic</a> practices"? that seems to get the point across without introducing innacuracies . . .

<p>I'm wondering if it would be helpful to make more mention in the article of the axis mundi concept as it relates to secular modern society. Eliade's work on the Sacred and Profane would be an excellent jumping off point, and I think is important as young readers (just remembering back to my first crack at Eliade in a Performance Studies class at uni) try to understand the concept from an ancient/indigenous/religious perspective. --<a href="../../../n/h/a/User%7ENhansen_20e1.html" title="User:Nhansen">user:nhansen</a></p>
