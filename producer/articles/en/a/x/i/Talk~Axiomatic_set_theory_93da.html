<p>Am I being very dense and missing something, or is this page inaccurate in that fails to mention the Subset Axiom (or Axiom of Separation, or Comprehension Axiom, as it is also sometimes known)? <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOnebyone_4a94.html" title="User:Onebyone">Onebyone</a> 12:01, 16 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Such as it is stated, the axiom of replacement implies the axiom of separation (simply take P(x,y) to be "x=y and Q(x)" where Q(x) is the predicate which you want to separate on). This is a classical trick. However, it doesn't do much harm to have redundant axioms (note that the axiom of infinity, properly stated, probably implies the axiom of the empty set, too). --<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGro-Tsen_3600.html" title="User:Gro-Tsen">Gro-Tsen</a> 05:11, 16 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(<i>Beginning of moved text</i>)</p>
<p><i>In fact, this idea can</i> be made very precise. If we follow the logic of set theory, we conclude that the universe of objects which have something to do with computation is a countable set, but since in set theory, there "exist" uncountable sets, there must exist objects that have nothing to do with computation.</p>
<p>However, we could define the mathematical universe to be the collection of objects which have something to do with computation. Set theory definitely has not shown that there is some inconsistency if we do so. And nothing of the mathematics which has the potential to be applied would be lost if we did so. The conclusion being that set theory, as it is currently conceived, introduces a world beyond what we can see and experience - a fantasy world.</p>
<p>The constructivists view the debate between themselves and the classical mathematicians as a science versus religion debate, very much analogous to the debate between the evolutionist and the creationists. The constructivist's idea is that the study of phenomena that can be observed within the universe of computation is a true science - it studies a universe which has an objective existence, something we all agree exists. The basic claim of the constructivists is that we do not need to believe in a world beyond what we can see and experience, to understand the world that we do see and experience.</p>
<p>To further the analogy, it should be noted that both creationism and set theory have similar origins. Creationism comes from the ancient jewish religious writings, and set theory has it origins in medieval jewish mystical thought known as the <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kabbalah.html" title="Kabbalah">Kabbalah</a>, where the search for knowledge of the infinite leads to knowledge of god. Certainly this is the view that was held by Cantor and many of the originators of set theory.</p>
<p>What the set theorist have accepted is essential a religious world view, and of course, they have a right to their views, but nevertheless, there are strong arguments as to why the religious view does not belong in the public domain, but the scientific view does. See science vs religion debate.</p>
<p>Set theorists of course do not accept this view (indeed, not all constructivists believe that there is a link between set theory and mysticism or religion). Set theory can be framed in computational terms by pointing out that sets are described with finite numbers of symbols, which are manipulated according to rules which can be followed by a computer. There is then no need to believe that sets "exist" (or for that matter that "functions", "numbers" or "<a href="../../../t/u/r/Turing_machine.html" title="Turing machine">Turing machines</a>" exist) other than as abstract concepts to aid mathematicians in manipulating these symbols. Application to the world which we experience then becomes a simple question of whether or not set theory provides results which are useful in science, not whether or not we can reconcile sets with physical objects. The characterisation of this debate as science vs religion is, according to this defence of set theory, a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a> argument, which attempts to defeat the set theorists' position without correctly representing it.</p>
<p>(<i>End of moved text</i>)</p>
<p>I don't think this is too much to do with axiomatic set theory. What the constructivists argue, in detail, can be put on separate page under a suitable title.</p>

<dd>I suppose the section <b>axioms for set theory</b> could be reduced to something like the first and last paragraphs. When it comes to independence results, I imagine independence from ZFC is most interesting case, and/or the only case anyone is going to bother to write up properly. Saying that isn't POV; it just reflects the fact that most mathematics implicitly is set in ZFC. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 16:27, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I inserted some brief references to the fact that there are other systems of axiomatic set theory (New Foundations and positive set theory). But I agree that ZFC is the dominant system of axiomatic set theory in practice and is also the first system of this kind (in the earlier form of Zermelo set theory).</p>

<p>The use of the term 'manifold' (in "Origins of rigorous set theory") is needlessly confusing in this context. If 'manifold' is meant to refer to a specific type of mathematical usage, this should be pointed out. If it just means 'many', then just say 'many'.</p>

<dd>I don't think it <i>should</i>, but it certainly <i>might</i>. I guess you can count it as a form of axiomatic set theory, indeed.

<p>i believe i know whence this "quote" of <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poincare.html" title="Poincare">Henri Poincaré</a> comes, and this is certainly not what he meant.</p>
<p>In the introduction to <i>Introduction to Set Theory</i>, by Gaisi Takeuti and Wilson M. Zaring, the severe problems that were discovered in axiomatic set theory at the beginning of the 20th century (most notorious of which being <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russell%27s_paradox.html" title="Russell's paradox">Russell's paradox</a>) are dicussed.</p>
<p>"Nevertheless set theory gained sufficient support to survive the crisis of the paradoxes. <b>In 1908, speaking at the International Congress in Rome, the great Henri Poincare (1854-1912) urged that a remedy be sought.</b>"</p>
<p>a footnote then leads to the following source:</p>
