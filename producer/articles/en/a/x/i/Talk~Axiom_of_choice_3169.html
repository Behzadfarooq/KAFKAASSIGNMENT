<p>The article states that the axiom choice says:</p>

<p>Wouldn't it clearer to say a <i>single</i> member? It would make an intuitive description of its negation easier as well. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelCPrice_72e7.html" title="User:MichaelCPrice">Michael C Price</a> 18:32, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can't see how that would add anything at all, choice let's you choose a member from each set. It can also let you choose two members if you want, there's nothing particularly special about the number of elements. And there's nothing ambiguous about "a member". Can "a member" ever mean anything other than "a single member"? But on the other hand, it also doesn't detract anything to say "a single member" instead of "a member", so if you want to add it, I won't complain. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">lethe</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig">talk</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" rel="nofollow">+</a></sup> 18:50, 17 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You are grammatically correct, but all I can say is that I wondered if "a member" meant "a single member" until I came across the phrase "exactly one element" -- as opposed to "an element" -- a bit later in the article. I'm sure other casual "lay" readers might wonder the same thing as well. With this emphasized it makes it easier to express ¬AC as corresponding to haveing "sticky fingers", whereby every choice or picking operation pulls out more than one member from each set.--<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelCPrice_72e7.html" title="User:MichaelCPrice">Michael C Price</a> 20:04, 17 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've never heard of this "sticky fingers" negation of choice which you describe. It seems to me that the ability to choose any finite number from each set of the collection is equivalent to AC. And obviously we can always "choose all at a time" without any form of choice. There may be weakened forms of choice which allow things like choosing countable subsets but not choosing single elements, though I've never heard of them. But this isn't a negation of choice. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">lethe</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig">talk</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" rel="nofollow">+</a></sup> 20:21, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But you can't choose <i>any</i> finite number from each set with sticky fingers, because you can't choose just one. OK, I thought it was a good way of describing it to lay people like myself, but perhaps I'm wrong.... --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelCPrice_72e7.html" title="User:MichaelCPrice">Michael C Price</a> 20:28, 17 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Suppose you had an axiom that allowed you to choose 3 objects from each of a collection of sets. I think I could prove that this allows also allows the choice of a single element. In other words, finite stickiness makes no difference. The only kind of stickiness that might matter would be an infinite stickiness; if you choose an infinite number from each set, then you may still not be able to also choose a single member. This wouldn't be a negation of choice though, just a weakened form. Anyway, I'm not sure of those theorems, they're just my intuition.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>My intuition agrees with yours -- finite stickness makes no difference; no matter how many times you wipe your fingers you still an infinite number stuck -- but I wasn't sure enough to mention this earlier. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelCPrice_72e7.html" title="User:MichaelCPrice">Michael C Price</a> 20:47, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As for finding a layman's description about choice, it's not hard. "Choose a member from each bucket" captures it exactly. What's hard is conveying to the layman why infinitely many choices is a lot less true than one might think. You might not be able to make infinitely many choices, and sticky fingers do not help. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">lethe</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig">talk</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" rel="nofollow">+</a></sup> 20:36, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree it's not hard to find a description of AC -- the article is OK on that. What I was searching for is a balancing lay description of ¬AC, which is obviously harder since most mathematicans seem to think ¬AC is counter-intuitive. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelCPrice_72e7.html" title="User:MichaelCPrice">Michael C Price</a> 20:47, 17 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>OK, I see. First of all, I will disagree about "most mathematicans seem to think ¬AC is counter-intuitive". ¬AC is quite weak, it simply says that there is one collection somewhere with no nonconstructive choices. Nonconstructive things are weird. Just because it's convenient to allow for the existence of those nonconstructive choices doesn't mean that mathematicians find their existence intuitive. Explanations of ¬AC are easier to give through equivalents, for example: the reals cannot be well-ordered or Hilbert space doesn't have an algebraic basis. These axioms both imply ¬AC. But the most explicit layman's description is this: there is some collection of buckets which is so infinitely big that, even though I could choose an element from any single bucket, I cannot choose elements one from each bucket all at the same time. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">lethe</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig">talk</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" rel="nofollow">+</a></sup> 21:10, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>Well, the quote section says "most mathematicians find the axiom of choice to be intuitive", and I took this as meaning that they therefore find ¬AC to be counter-intuitive. Your infinite number of buckets is OK as a lay description of ¬AC but that presumably doesn't exclude the "sticky fingers" analogy, which has the advantage that it only requires a finite number of sets / buckets. I guess it's a matter of taste; I find the sticky fingers picture more helpful than the infinite set example, which suggests that we should add both (or none) to the article. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelCPrice_72e7.html" title="User:MichaelCPrice">Michael C Price</a> 22:07, 17 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your sticky fingers axiom is not a statement of ¬AC, but rather a weaker version of choice. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">lethe</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig">talk</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" rel="nofollow">+</a></sup> 22:16, 17 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Maybe you want to say this: "there exists a collection of sets such that any choice of members from each set must be sticky enough that for infinitely many of the sets, the choices include infinitely many selections". This may be implied by ¬AC. It would require proof though, and a standard reference, before it could go into the article. On the other hand, the statement that I gave you is just the logical negation of the normal wording for the AC. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">lethe</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig">talk</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" rel="nofollow">+</a></sup> 22:22, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't see why the first use of "infinitely" is required; should it not be replaced with "some"? -- or the number of sets such be specified as infinite. So either:
<dl>
<dd>"there exists an infinite collection of sets such that any choice of members from each set must be sticky enough that for infinitely many of the sets, the choices include infinitely many selections"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>or

<dd>"there exists a collection of sets such that any choice of members from each set must be sticky enough that for some of the sets, the choices include infinitely many selections"</dd>

<dd>If I have a choice which is infinite at only finitely many buckets, then I have a choice which is never infinite (just apply finite AC to those buckets), and then this is not a negation. It seems to me that it has to happen infinitely often that you have to choose infinitely many with your sticky fingers. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">lethe</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig">talk</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" rel="nofollow">+</a></sup> 22:53, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You can always make a finite number of choices. This follows from ZF (sometimes it's called the finite axiom of choice, though it is no axiom). So if you have a collection of buckets and a choice which picks infinitely many elements at finitely many buckets, then, for those buckets, you can make a new choice function that chooses 1. Splice this back into the collection of all the buckets, and you have a choice function. As for the first formulation, I believe it implies ¬AC. I do even think it's equivalent to ¬AC. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">lethe</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig">talk</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" rel="nofollow">+</a></sup> 23:28, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, so how adding this at the end of the statement section:
<dl>
<dd><i>The negation of the axiom of choice, ¬AC, implies that there exists an infinite collection of sets such that for any choice of members from each set, and for infinitely many of the sets, the choices return infinitely many members.</i></dd>

<dd>I'm not especially fond of this formulation mostly for the reason that it is a fairly nonstandard usage of the notion of choice. Usually, choice is a function, which necessarily entails only a single choice. These multivalued choices will have to have different mathematical description. It could be done of course, but I'd feel better if there were an external source for it.

<dd>OK, I have another query, which I'd better get straight before anything else. The formal definition of AC states:
<dl>
<dd><i>Let</i> X <i>be a set of non-empty sets. Then there exists a <a href="../../../c/h/o/Choice_function.html" title="Choice function">choice function</a></i> f <i>defined on</i> X<i>. In other words, there exists a function</i> f <i>defined on</i> X<i>, such that for each set</i> s <i>in</i> X<i>,</i> f<i>(</i>s<i>) is in</i> s<i>.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Now I know that mathematicans all realise that this means "For <i>any</i> set X", but shouldn't we be explicit? How about:
<dl>
<dd><i>For any set of non-empty sets,</i> X<i>, there exists a <a href="../../../c/h/o/Choice_function.html" title="Choice function">choice function</a></i> f <i>defined on</i> X<i>. In other words, there exists a function</i> f <i>defined on</i> X<i>, such that for each set</i> s <i>in</i> X<i>,</i> f<i>(</i>s<i>) is in</i> s<i>.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>which permits an even more compact formulation of AC:
<dl>
<dd><i>Every set has a choice function.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dd>The verbiage "let <i>X</i> be something something. Then do something else, then I assert this about the result" is useful when you're going to do a lengthy manipulation with <i>X</i>. But here, we are simply asserting something about <i>X</i>, so that turn of phrase is needlessly verbose, and I would support the change you suggest. But your third suggestion, "every set has a choice function", is a little bit tricky. Only for sets of nonempty sets does the choice function make sense. Of course, in the familiar models of ZFC, every element of every set is also a set, so it's redundant to say "set of sets". Every set is a set of sets. But of course, they still have to be nonempty. Despite these misgivings, I still use "every set has a choice function" when speaking colloquially, I do think it's useful, as long as everyone knows the provisos. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">lethe</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig">talk</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" rel="nofollow">+</a></sup> 14:53, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There's an historical or cultural aspect of the AC that was related to me by a mathematican once that -- if true -- might be worth mentioning in the article. He claimed (and it seemed plausible to me) that the AC was looked upon with disfavor by the Soviet authorities (and many of their mathematicans) because it was judged to be anti-egalitarian. That you couldn't select just one member out of any set made a lot of sense within their dialectic and skewed their focus accordingly. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelCPrice_72e7.html" title="User:MichaelCPrice">Michael C Price</a> 20:04, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>My go-to reference for choice questions, <i>Handbook of Analysis and its Foundations</i> by Eric Schechter, says that MC, the multiple choice axioms, which asserts that it is possible to choose a nonempty subset from each of a collection of nonempty sets, is equivalent to AC (and notes that in particular regularity is necessary). Certainly three element choice implies MC. Thus actually the ability to choose 3 (or any finite number) from every set in a collection <i>is</i> equivalent to AC. Schechter says the proof is too long to include, so I guess it's not obvious, but true. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">lethe</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig">talk</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" rel="nofollow">+</a></sup> 17:23, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Er, I assume that MC is the requirement that you can choose a family of <i>proper</i> subsets from each of a collection of nonempty non-singleton sets, or something like that.</dd>
<dd>Can you check?</dd>
<dd>The condition you described is trivially true, as you can always choose the family of subsets to be the family of sets you began with; the condition I described isn't implied by three element choice.</dd>
<dd>In fact, without AC, it's possible to have a family of sets of cardinality three without having a choice function for that family. My somewhat naïve intuition is that you start with a model of ZF-C with such a family, then add sets to satisfy three element choice, but none of them are going to give you a choice function for that family, so AC isn't true ... no idea whether that works&#160;:-)</dd>

<p>If there is one counter-example to the axiom of choice, then there must be many counter-examples. This follows from the fact that there are many ways of encoding the first choice problem as a problem with different sets. For example, if X is the given set of nonempty sets which lacks a choice function, then consider the powerset (minus the singleton of the empty set) of the union of X. If that set had a choice function, then it could be used to well-order the union of X and thus get a choice function for X. Or one could take any other superset of X which has only nonempty members. Or one could form the set of Cartesian products of elements of X with a fixed nonempty set. <a href="../../../j/r/s/User%7EJRSpriggs_58fa.html" title="User:JRSpriggs">JRSpriggs</a> 10:35, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>According to a scan of a page from Suppes's textbook that Michael has provided me, the definition that Suppes uses is this: "For any set <i>A</i>, there is a function such that for every non-empty subset <i>B</i> ⊆ <i>A</i>, <i>f</i>(<i>B</i>) ∈ <i>B</i>". This function acts on all subsets of <i>A</i>, so its domain is the <a href="../../../p/o/w/Powerset.html" title="Powerset">powerset</a> <i>P</i>(<i>A</i>). So Suppes' axiom of choice states in our language "the powerset of every set has a choice function". <i>A priori</i> this looks weaker than the version we have in the article, which states that <i>every</i> set, not just sets which are powersets, has a choice function. Let's see if we can figure out that it's actually equivalent. For finite sets, there are a lot of sets which are not powersets; any set whose cardinality is not a power of 2 certainly cannot be a powerset. Finite sets don't matter when it comes to choice though. For infinite sets, cardinal arithmetic becomes a little simpler. <i>If</i> we assume the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Generalized_continuum_hypothesis.html" title="Generalized continuum hypothesis">generalized continuum hypothesis</a>, then every (infinite) set is equipollent with a powerset, so I think that Suppes's axiom of choice is equivalent to ours. However the GCH is independent of ZFC and many authors prefer not to have it, so Suppes's axiom of choice may be strictly weaker than our axiom of choice. That bothers me quite a bit, though I'm sure Suppes knows what he's doing. I actually have a copy of this book, but I lent it to one of my students. I'd like to see what he's doing with the GCH here.</p>
<p>Anyway, the issue that's concerning you about sets of sets versus sets is not contradicted by Suppes; his function acts on powersets, which are always sets of sets (of cats), never sets of cats. The issue here is that functions take as arguments <i>elements</i> of their domain, not <i>subsets</i> of their domain. That's just part of the set-theoretic definition of a function. Well, Suppes defines the term "choice function" slightly differently. For Suppes, a "choice function on <i>A</i>" is a function whose domain is the powerset of <i>A</i>, while for us, a choice function of a set is the set itself, but the set <i>must</i> also be a set of nonempty sets. So the statement "every set has a choice function" makes sense with Suppes's definition of choice function, but not with ours. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">lethe</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig">talk</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" rel="nofollow">+</a></sup> 10:48, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Using the above cat example, we may have a function such that f({snowball,mittens}) = snowball and so on. But this is a choice function on the powerset of {snowball, mittens, socks, cleopatra}, not on the set {snowball, mittens, socks, cleopatra} itself. So there is no contradiction with Suppes. I'm still disturbed by the fact that Suppes takes a strictly weaker form of choice though. JRSpriggs, can you check my reasoning above? Is this formulation of choice strictly weaker? -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">lethe</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig">talk</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" rel="nofollow">+</a></sup> 10:53, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I argued above that this axiom is strictly weaker than choice because not every set is a powerset. But actually, every set is less than some powerset (by Cantor), and choice functions on powersets restrict to choice functions on subsets of the powerset. So actually, I think Suppes's definition is equivalent to our version of AC, even in the absence of GCH. Also, I note that GCH implies AC, so this would be a pretty useless axiom in the presence of GCH. Alright, I'm satisfied with Suppes's formulation.

<dd>Regarding the revert; Chinju's edit was correct, we do have to only consider collections of nonempty sets.

<dd>Right, I meant that the two axioms (in terms of different definitions) were equivalent, not that the definitions were equivalent (they're not). But I think you're right; the Suppes definition is more intuitive. I think the current definition is more standard though, so I would like to have a large consensus before doing something drastic like changing definitions, and mentioning them both side by side seems awkward and liable to confuse because of the similarity.

<dd>Actually not only are the two formulations of AC the same, but so are the two formulations of choice. Let X = P({set of all cats}). The choice function is applied to all subsets of X, namely each {set of some cats} and we get f({set of some cats}) = a cat. So the choice function <i>can</i> act on sets of just urelements to select single elements, as you would expect intuitively. This equivalence means that the most compact version of AC, Suppes's <i>that every set has a choice function</i>, is valid ....? --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelCPrice_72e7.html" title="User:MichaelCPrice">Michael C.

<dd>The set of all (nonempty) sets of cats is a set of nonempty sets. With our definition of choice function, it only makes sense for sets of sets, and is only well-defined for sets of nonempty sets. The function you describe is defined on X, the power set of the set of cats. The choice function acts on <i>elements</i> of X (sets of cats), not subsets of X (sets of sets of cats). The domain of f is X (a set of sets of cats), though it can be restricted to subsets of X (any other set of sets of cats; this is why the Suppes formulation is equivalent).-<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">lethe</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig">talk</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" rel="nofollow">+</a></sup> 09:55, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Lethe asked whether Suppes's formulation (For any set A, there is a function such that for every <b>non-empty</b> subset B of A, f(B) is in B.(emphasis added)) is strictly weaker than the one we use here (Every set of nonempty sets has a choice function.). For any set X, X is a subset of the powerset of the union of X (assuming that X contains no urelements). Take A to be the union of X. If S is any element of X, then S is a subset of A. Thus Suppes's f(S) is an element of S. So the restriction of Suppes's choice function to X (which is a subset of its domain) is a choice function for X. So you are correct that Suppes's version of AC is equivalent to ours. <a href="../../../j/r/s/User%7EJRSpriggs_58fa.html" title="User:JRSpriggs">JRSpriggs</a> 05:20, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is another point which I think needs to be clarified. Suppes's statement of AC amounts to saying that for any set A, the powerset of A (minus the empty set) has a choice function. This is NOT the same as saying that A itself has a choice function. A choice function for the powerset is not a choice function for A. Although as I explained above the two formulation are equivalent as universal statements.

<dd>Sorry about a delayed reply. I must have missed this addendum. Anyway, I meant that Schechter uses the formulation of the axiom of choice in terms of subsets of a given set. He doesn't actually take the time to single out the concept of a "choice function". He just says there is a function on all nonempty subsets of a given set such that <i>f</i>(<i>U</i>) ∈ <i>U</i>. He calls that AC1, it coincides with Suppes. Then I think it was AC3 (I don't have it in front of me at the moment) which says that for any collection of sets, there is a function such that <i>f</i>(<i>A</i>) ∈ <i>A</i>, which coincides with that used in this article. I guess if you want to talk about choice functions, then your hand is forced about which definition of choice function you have to use depending on which formulation of AC you want to take. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">lethe</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig">talk</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" rel="nofollow">+</a></sup> 05:48, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would like to read about models of the negation of AC. Are the constructions too elaborate to be described in a paragraph?

<dd>It's complicated. (And this is my field, so please bear with me.) Because the constructible sets are <i>constructed</i>, there is a <i>constructible</i> choice function on the <i>constructible sets</i>. Hence, the inner model <b>L</b> satisfies the axiom of choice.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for models without choice, it's relatively easy to construct inner models of ZFU (with <a href="../../../u/r/-/Ur-element.html" title="Ur-element">ur-elements</a>) in which choice fails by looking at the elements preserved by one of a filter of permutations. Probably the simplest technique would be to start with a model <b>M</b> of ZFC and "add" a countable set <i>U</i> of <a href="../../../u/r/-/Ur-element.html" title="Ur-element">ur-elements</a> to get a model <b>M</b>[<i>U</i>] (or <b>L</b>[<i>U</i>] within <b>M</b>).

The class <b>N</b> of all elements of <b>M</b>[<i>U</i>] which are preserved by all elements of some subgroup in <b>F</b> form a model of ZFU in which choice fails.</dd>

When constructing constructible sets one is given free use of the ordinal numbers and also of the hierarchy <i>L</i><sub>α</sub>.

The axiom of choice allows one to give a non-constructive proof of the existence of certain sets.

<p>Does the statement "Given *one* non-empty set, one can choose some element of it" require the axiom of choice?</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is implicitly included in the article, when it discusses choice for finite families of sets. The axiom of choice is not necessary to choose an element of a single nonempty set. The formal reason for this is that there is a deduction rule (sometimes known as <i>existential elimination</i>) which says that if you have proved <img class='tex' src="../../../math/f/9/b/f9bc6dddf40c735904f51ff388a6c7fe.png" alt="\exists x \phi(x)" /> then you can take a new (not previously used) constant symbol <i>c</i> and assume <img class='tex' src="../../../math/9/e/e/9ee6fd9a87ce4b7d335ba7cb3c985e10.png" alt="\phi(c)\," /> holds, and this is a sound proof technique. Saying that a set <i>A</i> is nonempty means <img class='tex' src="../../../math/f/2/8/f289df3d83e30c9f7b1c4e3c1d1c6f6d.png" alt="\exists x ( x \in A)" />, from which you get <img class='tex' src="../../../math/a/2/f/a2fc1befd63eb124214ce36dd697b26e.png" alt="c \in A" /> for a new constant <i>c</i>. (This proof technique is even valid in intuitionistic logic assuming you have shown <img class='tex' src="../../../math/f/2/8/f289df3d83e30c9f7b1c4e3c1d1c6f6d.png" alt="\exists x (x \in A)" /> and not just <img class='tex' src="../../../math/a/6/2/a6201ed4dcaaea78b4355e9125db734d.png" alt="\lnot \lnot \exists x (x \in A)" /> ). <a href="../../../c/m/u/User%7ECMummert_c108.html" title="User:CMummert">CMummert</a> 18:49, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Suppose someone holds out a bag and says "This bag may or may not contain some marbles (but not anything else).". If you reach into the bag and try to grasp a marble, what happens? If you get one, then you have chosen a distinguished marble from among those in the bag. If not, then the bag must have been empty. In other words, a set being non-empty MEANS that you can choose an element from it. Consequently, ordinary <a href="../../../f/i/r/First-order_logic.html" title="First-order logic">first-order logic</a> allows you to choose an element from a single non-empty set without having to use the axiom of choice. If you can do this once, then you can repeat it any finite number of times. So you can create a choice function for any finite collection of non-empty sets without using the axiom. Thus the axiom is only needed for infinite collections of non-empty sets; and even then only if no systematic method of choosing is known. Does that make it clear? <a href="../../../j/r/s/User%7EJRSpriggs_58fa.html" title="User:JRSpriggs">JRSpriggs</a> 07:12, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, you are not talking about the real world which is what classical logic addresses. In some other universe, perhaps a different kind of logic would be appropriate where such choice was not allowed.

<dd>At the risk of sounding like a maths crank, surely appealing to the "real world" is a strange way for a mathematican to argue? AC is equivalent to being able to select (I delibrately avoid the word "choose") a single subset from <i>every set</i>. Therefore the negation of AC states that there exists at least one set for which we can't select a single subset. Ergo, unless we assume AC, we can't assume that we can pick an element from a single, arbitrary set; the answer to the opening query would seem "yes". If this isn't true then the article needs to explain this more clearly. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelCPrice_72e7.html" title="User:MichaelCPrice">Michael C.

<dd>It's not true at all that the AC is required to choose an element from an arbitrary nonempty set. The claim of equivalence in the previous post simply isn't correct. What the AC is required for is to <i>uniformly</i> choose elements from a family of nonempty sets, all at the same time. This is what the second paragraph of the introduction clearly states, and the definition in terms of choice functions makes precise. The article attempts to address this in the section on choice for finite families of nonempty sets; anyone is free to edit that section to make it clearer if they wish. I added the word <i>simultaneously</i> to the definition, which might help resolve this confusion. <a href="../../../c/m/u/User%7ECMummert_c108.html" title="User:CMummert">CMummert</a> 21:27, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's a logical concept, rather than one in set theory. If something exists, it can be explicated (i.e., chosen). This can be extended to a choice function on any finite (as seen from the meta-theory) set (at least in "conventional" logic — as is pointed out in the text, the axiom of choice for sets containing two, not necessarily distinct, elements, implies the law of the excluded middle). Proving, within (conventional) set theory, that any "finite" set has a choice function is more difficult. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 19:07, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The axiom of choice is a mathematical statement; specifically, one that is formulated in the language of set theory. From the mathematical point of view, I don't see what "we" and "definitely" (and also "choose") means. You may be talking about a class version of choice (since you consider arbitrary sets), or you may be talking about introducing an existential quantifier (since you consider one set only). Or (most likely) you mean something entirely different. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAleph4_0f7d.html" title="User:Aleph4">Aleph4</a> 11:58, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not sure if this is it, but a negation of AC would be more like: there is a set from which we cannot choose one element from every one of its non-empty elements, OR: there is a set from which we cannot choose one element from every one of its non-empty subsets (Suppes), BUT NOT: there is a non-empty set from which we cannot choose one element. This may possibly relate back to the difference between choice function over a set of sets, versus choice function over a power set (and I see that you have gone over that ground here before). If I look in the variants section I see "every set has a choice function", but then if I take "choice function" to be as described in the first "Statements" section, then f(s) is an element of s. Leading to the idea that a choice function is necessary to get an element out of s. The variants section does try to caution against this, but possibly it doesn't spell out what it is as clearly as the Statements section did. Maybe:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Statement</b>
<dl>
<dd><i>For any set of non-empty sets, X, there exists a function f defined on X such that for every set s in X, f(s) is an element of s.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The function <i>f</i> is called a <a href="../../../c/h/o/Choice_function.html" title="Choice function">choice function</a>, <i>blah</i>...</dd>
<dd><b>Variants</b>
<dl>
<dd><i>For any set X, there exists a function f defined on the <a href="../../../p/o/w/Powerset.html" title="Powerset">powerset</a> of X such that for every Y which is a non-empty <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subset.html" title="Subset">subset</a> of X, f(Y) is an element of Y.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The function <i>f</i> here is also called a choice function, but there is a slight difference, <i>blah</i>...</dd>
</dl>
<p>Of course, the process of tacking on what exactly is the choice function will go against the whole enterprise of stating the axiom of choice in as few words as possible. In any case I don't claim to know why (or if) it was confusing as it stood, just throwing it out there as a possibility. 192.75.48.150 14:39, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>We can both remove the definition of "choice function" from the definition of AC and make a considerable simplification of the problem by focussing on single sets by adopting Suppes' equivalent definition (see previous discussion on talk page) of the axiom of choice:
<dl>
<dd><i>For any set A there is a function f such that for any non-empty subset B of A, <img class='tex' src="../../../math/2/7/1/2718d00be76bbeb83545796fda3cfb96.png" alt="f(B)\in B" /></i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Therefore the negation of AC assumes the existence of a subset B that does <i>not</i> satisfy <img class='tex' src="../../../math/2/7/1/2718d00be76bbeb83545796fda3cfb96.png" alt="f(B)\in B" />, i.e. it is not possible to choose a single element of the said subset. Since a subset is automatically a set we have shown that the negation of AC demonstrates the existence of a set from which we cannot select a single element. Ergo AC is required to select a single member from an arbitrary set. Note this problem vanishes for finite sets: AC is not required for them. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelCPrice_72e7.html" title="User:MichaelCPrice">Michael C.

<dd>Expanding on Arthur's answer slightly: For every natural number <i>n</i>, there is a natural number <i>m</i> such that <i>m</i> is greater than <i>n</i>. It doesn't follow that there's a single <i>m</i> that's greater than every <i>n</i>. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 20:37, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the expansion&#160;:-) , although I wish Arthur would be more explicit (his own wording of ¬AC starts with "there is", so is this really his objection?). But your example does not prove that <i>m</i> does not exist either (although we know for other reasons that it doesn't). --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelCPrice_72e7.html" title="User:MichaelCPrice">Michael C.

<dd>Are we saying the article might lead someone to believe that not-AC implies there is such a sticky set?

<dd>When Arthur's "word bag" refills perhaps we'll find out, but I think the confusion/disagrement stems from the existential difference between not adopting AC (which does not require a sticky set) and adopting not-AC (which requires(?) a sticky set). --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelCPrice_72e7.html" title="User:MichaelCPrice">Michael C.

<p>Okay, I think I get it now. The axiom of choice is only an issue or required when you are presented with an infinite number of fiat choices to make. So we can always pick a marble from a bag of identical marbles: the problems would start if we had an infinite number of bags of marbles and no rule for specifying which one to choose from each bag. The axiom of choice asserts that such a selection procedure always exists, without specifying its details. Is that correct? --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelCPrice_72e7.html" title="User:MichaelCPrice">Michael C.

<dd>König's theorem would give you one set containing infinitely many choice functions; you don't need AC to pick an element from a single set, as per the above discussion. If you had an uncountable collection of families of sets and you wanted a choice function for each family, you'd need to use AC twice: once to ensure existance of choice functions for each family of sets; then again to pick one choice funtion for each family in the collection. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 210.54.148.98 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_210.54.148.98_abbe.html" title="Special:Contributions/210.54.148.98">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<p>Thank you, CMummert. This is exactly what I meant.<br />
Borel determinacy cannot be proved in ZF, because it would show that the countable union of countable set of reals is countable, and I think (again I do not remember the reference) that it is even consistent with ZF that the reals can be covered with a countable union of countable sets.<br />
To show that the union of countably many set A(0), A(1), ... is countable (from ZF + Borel determinacy), consider the following game: Player I chooses n, and then player II has to enumerate the set A(n). Again player I does not have a winning strategy. (And again this is not "my" proof.)<br />

<dd>The <i>G(T,X)</i> notation refers to a tree <i>T</i> on some set <i>Z</i> (that is, a set of finite tuples from <i>Z</i> closed under subsequence), and a winning condition <i>X</i> which is a subset of the branches through <i>T</i>. The players cooperatively construct a branch, and <i>I</i> wins if the branch is in <i>X</i>. You have to make some arbitrary decision about what happens if you get to a leaf (usually the last player loses). It's one of the things that still needs to be added to the <a href="../../../d/e/t/Determinacy.html" title="Determinacy">determinacy</a> article (there's a subsection, <a href="../../../d/e/t/Determinacy.html#Games_played_on_trees" title="Determinacy">determinacy#Games played on trees</a>). --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 17:34, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I gave this article a B rating on the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Mathematics_Wikipedia_1.0_4246.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Mathematics/Wikipedia 1.0">WP 1.0</a> rating scale. But the article is actually better than that sounds; the rating system is not granular enough. With a little work, this could be a B+ or A quality article. Here are some places the article could be improved. I will improve some of them myself over time.</p>
<ul>
<li>The concept of a model of set theory is delicate and difficult for many people, so defining them and explaining what independence means in terms of models of set theory would be helpful.</li>
<li>The paragraph on nonconstructivity coud be phrased more clearly.</li>
<li>The paragraph on category theory could be expanded.</li>
<li>In the <b>references</b> section, the only textbook is Suppes. I'm not looking for inline citations for everything (not by far), but right now the references really are quite modest.</li>
<li>The section on the law of the excluded middle could use more explanation on what these constructive set theories are and why this proof is interesting. The section is just a proof right now.</li>

<p>Zorn's Lemma is used to construct nonprincipal ultrafilters. Can we prove some form of AC from their existence?

<dd>It's consistent that the real line is a countable union of countable sets; in that case some property of the Lebesgue measure must fail.

<ol>
<li>Any countable set has Lebesgue measure 0. (No reference, but it follows from every singleton has Lebesgue measure 0 and <a href="../../../l/e/b/Lebesgue_measure.html#Properties" title="Lebesgue measure">Lebesgue measure#Properties</a> 2.)</li>
<li>Lebesgue measure is countably additive. (Again, <a href="../../../l/e/b/Lebesgue_measure.html#Properties" title="Lebesgue measure">Lebesgue measure#Properties</a> 2.)</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Therefore, any countable union of countable sets has Lebesgue measure 0.</dd>
<dd>If, then, the reals are a countable union of countables, then the reals have Lebesgue measure 0, contradiction <a href="../../../l/e/b/Lebesgue_measure.html#Properties" title="Lebesgue measure">Lebesgue measure#Properties</a> 1.</dd>

<dd>Re property 1, every countable set is contained in a <a href="../../../g/-/d/G-delta_set.html" title="G-delta set">G-delta set</a> of measure 0, which is relevant here because it shows that countable sets have measure 0 without requiring countable additivity of the measure.
