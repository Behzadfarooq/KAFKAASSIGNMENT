<p>It is a popular misconception that the sun is at its greatest elevation above the horizon at noon every day. This misconception is reflected in the "Measurement" section: "...the difference of the heights of the Sun above the horizon at noon on the longest and shortest day of the year is twice the obliquity."</p>
<p>Because of the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit around the Sun, the angular velocity of the Earth's orbital motion is not constant. The axial tilt of the Earth also causes a periodic variation in the time that the Sun reaches the meridian. As a result, the Sun may cross the meridian (and reach its maximum height above the horizon) as early as 16 min 33 s before noon (around November 3) or as late as 14 min 6 sec after noon (around February 12). This is explained in detail on the “Equation of time” page.</p>
<p>Of course there is always a tradeoff between maximum scientific accuracy on the one hand and the goal of keeping articles simple and straightforward for non-technical readers on the other hand.</p>
<p>One possibility: “...the difference of the maximum heights of the Sun above the horizon at midday on the longest and shortest day of the year is twice the obliquity.”</p>
<p>The last paragraph of the section would also need to be tweaked similarly.</p>

<p>The text states that the Earth's axial tilt varies between 21.5° and 24.5°. But according to the image it ranges from 22.1 to 24.5. Marcel</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>I have a question about the Moon's 1.5 degree axial tilt. If astronomers were to give the Moon northern and southern tropical circles, and the equivalent of arctic and antarctic circles, would the tropics be 1.5 degrees north and south of the Moon's equator, and the arctic and antarctic circles 88.5 degrees north and south of the Moon's equator?</p>
<p>Thank you. Bruce McClure</p>

<dd>It is not that simple. The axis of the moon inclines 1°32' with its orbit around the earth, which on its turn inclines by 5°09'. Therefore the total inclination of the axis with the ecliptic is 6°41' as the two angles always add up due to forced interaction. This was discovered by Cassini in 1721. The information in the <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moon.html" title="Moon">moon</a> article is wrong (was wrong, very soon now) --Tauʻolunga 09:25, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I took out the sentence which said that for "the axial tilt is 0 or 180 depending on whether the planet is rotating in the same direction as its orbital motion". This does not make any sense for the following two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The axial tilt is the angle between the normal of the orbital plane and the axis of rotation of the body. So if the rotation axis is perpendicular to the orbital plane then the angle is 90 degrees, not more, not less! The axial tilt of <a href="../../../u/r/a/Uranus_%28planet%29.html" title="Uranus (planet)">Uranus</a> is listed as 97 degress.</li>
<li>If the planet's axis of rotation actually lies in the orbital plane how do you define if it has proper or retrograde rotation? The rotation direction is determimed by the rotation of the "north pole" with respect to the ecliptic but in that case both poles actually lie on the orbital plane and neither one is to the north.</li>

<dl>
<dd>I feel that the degrees, when referenced at greater than 90, are helpful. Anything greater than 90 degrees shows that the body is rotating in retrograde to its orbital direction. Example: Venus at 2.64 is true, but does not give a hint that it is rotating in a direction opposite from its orbital direction. Venus at 117.36 is likewise true, but shows that Venus is rotating in retrograde (to its orbital direction). As long as the point of relation is regarding the body's orbital plane and direction (i.e., obliquity), then using the 180º perspective works. In addition, in this context, concerns regarding the arbitrary "north-south" perspective is not an issue (in the context Obliquity to Orbital Direction, it need not be a perspective point). At least, this is true regarding the planets in our solar system (all revolve (orbit) in the same direction. Granted, when detailing aspects of some planetoids and satellites (those that orbit in the opposite direction, clarifying text should be added to such page to inform the reader that the orbital direction is opposite from the standard "northern-perspective, counter-clockwise" direction.</dd>
<dd>I think a problem stems from several of the pages attempting to use inclination, obliquity, and ecliptic (earth’s orbital plane) as relation points. In doing so, the pages need to be brought into some consistent term usage. See my entry, below, regarding Terms and Usage for Inclination, Obliquity, and Axial Tilt. Tesseract501 7 March 2007</dd>

<p>I am by no means an expert on this subject but some things caught my attention. First, we sometimes use degrees minutes and seconds and at other times we use decimal degrees. Should both be used or only one or the other or does it depend?</p>
<p>Second, early in the article we say that the Earth has an axial tilt of about 23° 27’ and later we say that in 1976 ε equaled 23° 26’ 21.44". We also say that the degree of tilt is diminishing. Is ε the same as the axial tilt? If so, shouldn't the current degree of tilt be smaller than 23° 26’?</p>
<p>Last, the Tropic of Cancer article says the rate of change is about 0.5" per year but this article does not give a number. --<a href="../../../y/e/l/User%7EYellowLeftHand_8224.html" title="User:YellowLeftHand">YellowLeftHand</a> 22:59, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Axial Inclination may be a mixing term usage. Equatorial Inclination or Axial Tilt might be the more accurate usages. A so-called inclination for the axis would be from polar. I belive that most technical references use the term "tilt" for such, and the term "inclination" regarding degrees "inclined" from an equatorial or orbital-plane persepctive. When you did your search, that could be why the system sent you in a bit of trip around-about, side-to-side (inclination) or up-and-down (tilt)? Tesseract501 7 March 2007</dd>

<p>The pages detailing the Planets and the Planetoids (asteroids, TNO, dwarf planets) are great. The authors do great work and I appreciate all the effort and dedication they take. I do have a suggestion, however. I believe that we need some additional consistency regarding some items on the tables. A problem stems from several of the pages using inconsistent relationship reference points for the Inclination, Obliquity, and Ecliptic (earth’s orbital plane) data. In doing so, the pages need to be brought into some consistent term usage. For example:</p>
<ol>
<li>INCLINATION: The use of the item for INCLINATION, under the Orbital Characteristics table section (under the various Planet/Planetoid pages), is inconsistent. Suggestion -- INCLINATION should relate to the body's orbital plane in relation to the Earth's ecliptic (orbital) plane. If the authors use something else, then they need to specify the "from-and-to" relationship. Otherwise, the reader is open to confusion, assumption, and the need to check alternative source documents. Examples of variations-of-use that need to be specified on various Planet/Planetoid pages: Axial Tilt in relation to the Ecliptic, Body's orbital plane in relation to the Sun's equator, Body's equatorial inclination in relation to the Ecliptic).</li>
<li>OBLIQUITY: The use of the items under the Physical Characteristics table section (on the various planet/planetoid pages) is inconsistent, as well. Some authors use the term: Axial Tilt. Others use the term: Equatorial Inclination. The ambiguous term, Inclination, is used as well. Suggestion -- OBLIQUITY should be used, and refer to the Body's equatorial inclination to its own orbital plane around the Host Star. In the case of satellites and sub-members of binary systems, the relationship can be to the Principal Subsystem Host (instead of the Host Star), but references to such should be added to the label or to the supporting text. Im addition, if the author wishes to indicate additional information on the table, that is super -- but doing so should include clarification text</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>Examples: The Pluto page referencing Pluto's axial tilt in relation to its orbital plane and to the Earth's Ecliptic (an unusual relationship reference for a planet’s axial tilt). Charon's relationship to Pluto (its principal. Etc.</dd>
</dl>
<p>At present, several of the Planet and Planetoid (asteroid and TNO pages) use INCLINATION and AXIL TILT as table items, without clarification as to the relationships (orbital plane, ecliptic, Sun's equator, etc.). Again, this ambiguity puts the reader in the position of having to go to secondary source documents to verify the intent and accuracy of the page data. I do not know if this is the page best suited to post these suggestions, but I will copy this under the Inclination and Obliquity sections too. Tesseract501 7 March 2007</p>
