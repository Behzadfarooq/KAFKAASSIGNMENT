<p>This article only tangentially engages with the concept behind "axis of evil", instead focusing on the phrase itself (its origins, its parodic mutations). It may be a soundbite, but it does also designate a strategic concept, something like "the set of all terror-sponsoring, WMD-seeking states with whom we have an antagonistic relationship", and a deeper article would have to frame it as a statement of American <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_strategy.html" title="Grand strategy">grand strategy</a> in the war on terror. Certain questions then immediately arise, such as: Is this a sensible strategic concept? Is it an accurate depiction of the strategic thinking actually guiding the war? How does it intersect with the grand strategies of other great powers, such as Russia, China, and India (all mentioned in the 2002 State of the Union, as partners in the war on terror)? How does it relate to previous American strategic doctrine, to the prior State Department practice of enumerating "state sponsors of terror", how central is it to the evolving Bush Doctrine, etc.? Some of the article's comments do address these topics, but mostly it is treated rather casually, purely as a piece of political rhetoric. <a href="../../../m/p/o/User%7EMporter_1d80.html" title="User:Mporter">Mporter</a> 4 Dec 2004 (AEST)</p>

<p>My 66 kopeks. Unlike President Reagan's "Evil Empire" phrase, which was at the time both an original slogan and an impecably timed rhetorical bombshell against the USSR, President Bush's phrase "Axis of evil" is just plain bad copy. It's loud and clumsy and seeks too hard for a flashy effect. As such, it's fair game for parody, and I'd vote to leave every single example backed up by enough google hits. Further, this article is the proper place to list these parodies. The phrase has generated news and interest, much of it for its lameness. On the other hand, it would be completely inappropriate to list parodies elsewhere, for instance on President Bush's entry, so this article is a good place for the list. NPOV concerns could be addressed by providing a heading in support of the phrase (the phrase itself, not idea) or a list of instances where the phrase was quoted in a positive manner, if you can find any. <a href="../../../v/f/p/User%7EVfp15_4f08.html" title="User:Vfp15">Vincent</a> 06:42, 2 Sep 2004 (UTC)<br />
Why not resolve the issue as you would with a work of art (e.g. <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mona_Lisa_763f.html" title="Mona Lisa">Mona Lisa</a>) that has often been parodied: "See also Parodies of "Axis of Evil"" The inherent foolishness of "axis of evil" must be allowed to display itself without overt POV commentary. <a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">Wetman</a> 17:52, 4 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is actually a very clever and subtle joke, and should stand as a valid example of parody. A defining characteristic of medieval European diplomacy was the role religion played, particularly the idea of <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universality.html" title="Universality">Universality</a>: power plays always involved appeals to God, to rightneousness. Late in the renaissance, diplomacy changed to a system of non-religious national interests build in large part by Cardinal de Richelieu. (See Henry Kissenger's book Diplomacy for a fascinating analysis of the evolution of the modern nation state.)</p>
<p>Now President Bush is in fact a self-declared born-again Christian and does seem to be guided by his religious views. He certainly presents himself that way, though in a more conciliatory fashion than say Pat Robertson. "Axis of Medieval" is a fair parody since it points out a similarity between medieval diplomacy, where religious justification was vital, and President Bush's foreign policy, allegedly guided by the president's religious views. Phrased like that, would the President, at least in private, deny turning to God for guidance on foreign policy? And that's the point the joke makes. <a href="../../../v/f/p/User%7EVfp15_4f08.html" title="User:Vfp15">Vincent</a> 08:45, 2 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../v/f/p/User%7EVfp15_4f08.html" title="User:Vfp15">Vincent</a> , usage of the term "evil" is not limited denominationally to born-again Christians or faith-wise to Christians per se. Rather it is a generic term which when used in Bush's speech betrayed no evidence of born-again Christian bias. Therefore, the "medieval parody" is a needlessly argumentative, tangental reference to something that exists only in the mind of a speculative few. Frankly, if "Axis of Medieval" was actually well known enough to have the bona-fide cultural currency you say that it does, it would not need to be explanied as being a being "Christian". Also, your entire historical frame of referrence does not apply here. Those Medieval European leaders who did have a form of faith (and you cannot posibly say thay all uniformly did), if they were Christians, were for the most part Roman Catholics of a much different ilk than others of today. To crudely lump modern born-again Christians in with practitioners of a far different denomination (faith,even), is gross anti-Christian bigotry in my view. This would be like trying to say that modern Hassidic Jews are the same as the ancient Israelis who sacrificed animals, etc. Your comments, I feel, indicate that you may have an animus towards born-again Christians, or you are simply not well enough informed on the topic to make the distinction I am making. And for your information, the modern "born-again Christian" movement in the USA, is less than 100 years old. The methods and practices of this faith are not rooted in the rituals and supersitions of Medieval Europe and to suggest that they are is wrong.

<dd>Bush was referring to countries that sponsor terrorism, and named the above three countries as examples. His words have been misinterpreted by some to mean that the "axis of evil" consists solely of those three countries.</dd>

Seen from a marxist point of view this talk about an "axis of evil" is imperialist propaganda. The true axis is that of US-imperialism. Many articles of this kind on wikipedia are very biased toward the view of the US-imperialists. What has the people of Iran, Iraq and DPRK to say about this?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Is Anti-US propaganda any better? "US-Imperialism" and "US-imperialists" are both extremely biased statements as well.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Well what is the war in Iraq if not US-imperialism? The USA has violated international law in a war for oil. Is this a biased term? I don't think so. When a nation starts a war in violation of international law, what else can it be?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>&#160;: I disagree, your (biassed) view is the war was solely for Iraq's oil. My (biassed) view was that it was the fact that Iraq was looking to deal in euros - which would have weakened the dollar. Both of those views are <i>just views</i> though. Stating the war was for any reason, aside from the official view, is wrong and biassed. Yes, say that many people believe the war was for oil, but dont say that is the reason. Liberating the iraqi people, or searching for WMD, is not <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperialism.html" title="Imperialism">imperialism</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Weaver_c7df.html" title="User:Paul Weaver">Paul Weaver</a> 15:13 6 Jun 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Given that the UK is pursuing a policy of "engagement" towards Iran, this seems misleading. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a></p>

<p>Tony is asked "Was [axis of evil] a good choice of words though?". He responds: "I think it's for each politician to use their own words". That's hardly a ringing endorsement, and I think Blair is very careful <i>not</i> to support Bush's phrase, while supporting Bush's general policy. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a></p>

<p>I removed "Axis of Medieval" -- I only found about 115 hits on Google and the top few were about the education system (in Britain, I think), not at all the definition given here. "Axis of Feeble" also seems to have not taken on much of a life as a parody, so I removed it as well. "Axis of Weasels" plus "Axis of Weasel" gets some 6800 hits on Google. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Quinlan_49be.html" title="User:Daniel Quinlan">Daniel Quinlan</a> 22:51 26 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have removed the image "Asses of Evil" depicting the President, the Vice President, and the Secretary of Defense. Although it has been restored once already, I have again removed it on the grounds that it is inappropriate and decidedly unscholarly. Considering that the bulk of the article relates to the term in terms of actual foreign policy, I think it highly inappropriate that the only image in the entire article be a disrespectful one illustrating a remark made by one person and mentioned only in one sentence in an addendum to the main article. The image does not belong in this article, adds nothing to it, and actually detracts from it. <a href="../../../p/u/b/User%7EPublius_cf3a.html" title="User:Publius">Publius</a> 19:55, 12 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If it was at the top of the article, you'd have a legitimate complaint. The fact that it's the only image is irrelevant. If you think this page needs a better image, then find one (perhaps one of Bush delivering that speech) don't delete the one that's already here. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 20:25, 12 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The issue is not whether or not the page needs "another" image. The issue is that the image adds nothing to the article, provides an unnecessary illustration of an unimportant sentence, and is unjustifiably disrespectful. The image serves no useful purpose, within the main body of the article or within the "Parody" section. It is inappropriate for a scholarly work. As you appear adamant that the image should remain, I will not delete it a third time; I leave the matter to your prudential good judgment. <a href="../../../p/u/b/User%7EPublius_cf3a.html" title="User:Publius">Publius</a> 21:11, 12 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Rex, I don't think that either a threat or a heads-up is appropriate when it takes form of "Anyone doing thus-and-such will have an RfC filed against them." You've listed the RfC here under "Article content", so it's supposed to be a mechanism for getting many more people to consider a specific content question, not something that's filed "against" anyone (contrast with those RfC's that relate to user conduct). While I'm fruitlessly lecturing you about the rules, I'll add that the statement of the RfC is supposed to be neutral, and your use of the term "guise" (insinuating dishonesty on the part of people who disagree with you) is not neutral.</dd>

<dd>Turning to the merits: The phrase "asses of evil" as applied to Bush-Cheney-Rumsfeld is clearly significant enough to be mentioned, inasmuch as clothing and other merchandise with a similar image is available <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/assesofevil/336949" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cafepress.com/assesofevil/336949" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. The article also misses "axles of evil" about SUV's. I'll add these two to the "Parody" section. Once they're given in text, the image adds nothing to the reader's understanding of the original term or the parody. I don't agree with Publius's concern about its being "disrespectful". Our duty is not to George W. Bush, but to the reader. If fulfilling that duty requires us to report an instance of people being disrespectful to Bush or to anyone else, so be it. This particular image should go because it doesn't help inform the reader, not because Dubya might be upset at it. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 10:11, 1 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I find this logic puzzling, as any picture on wikipedia is simply an illustration of something discussed in the text, and thus by this line of thinking no picture here does anything to "inform the reader". A photo of Bush delivering the "Axis of Evil" line does nothing to "inform the reader", but I doubt its inclusion here would find any opposition.

<dd>JML, please contain yourself from your continued insults against my English usage. According to The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition, 2000 <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/61/79/G0307900.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bartleby.com/61/79/G0307900.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, the <b>primary</b> definition of "guise" is <i>"Outward appearance or aspect; semblance"</i>. The deception concept usage of "guise" as in <i>"False appearance; pretense"</i>, is only a <b>secondary</b> definition. Thus, once again, it is <b>your bias</b> which made you leap to conclusions, infer the worst about me and make erroneous assumptions. Perhaps, next time, you can ask me how I intended the usage, before slamming me, eh? And the RfC was "against" Gamaliel. As evidenced by your comments, the image in question does not belong here - this is common sense to you. And yet, Gamaliel reverted me three times over it. It was precisely to build enough pressure "against" Gamaliel to make him stop that, that I filed the RfC. Had he simply been reasonable about, he would not have had to be embarrassed this way.

<p>Gamaliel, at the point in time where I alerted you about an RfC if you continued, you had already ignored the well reasoned comments of another editor as well as my edit summary of <i>Parody - delete "asses of evil" image = way too POV</i>. Suffice it to say, you have limited credibility with me right now about this, because you reverted me right up to the max. In light of the fact that you ignored both Publius's comments and my edit summary, there was no reason to presume that you would pay any attention at all to more dialog. Further, the fact that your mind, as evidenced by your comments here, is closed on the question of appropriateness, confirms that trying to reason with you on this point is fruitless. Frankly, it appears the only thing you will consider is a broad-based litany of comments which oppose that image. This being the case, I have endeavored to get others to involve themselves. And as you can see, even my frequent editing nemesis, JML, agrees that this image does not belong here. So frankly Gamaliel, it is obvious that you are in the wrong here.

<dd>I did not ignore Publius, we had a discussion about his comments as anyone can see above. That discussion concluded some time ago. My mind is not "closed" on this matter, I simply have come to a different conclusion than you have. You have not attempted to reason with me or understand this different conclusion, you have simply threatened me with an RfC. The fact that I have "limited credibility" with someone who got himself banned from several articles for POV edits and insulting comments matters little to me. Despite this, I am willing to discuss this if you are actually willing to engage in a substantive dialogue for once, instead of your usual tactics of edit wars, insults, and accusations.

<dd>Considering you began this discussion by threatening me, which one of us is adversarial and agressive? I disagree that I am inconsistent between pages at all, but I won't hold my breath waiting for you to come up with examples of my supposed inconsistency. In any case, what is relevant here is that we disagree what the principle of POV means. A partisan attack is POV, yes, but documenting partisan attacks is not POV at all, simply the recording of important factual information. FACT: "Axis of evil" is being parodied. FACT:"Asses of Evil" is a AoE parody. What's the problem here?

<dd>I find your characterizations distressing, please desist. As to your point of "documenting partisan attacks" - if this is done by unduly higlighting them with imbedded graphics, then it's indeed POV. If you simply must refer people to "AssesOfEvil.png" you can do so via a link to the image page. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:AssesOfEvil.png" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:AssesOfEvil.png" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> Other than POV intentions, there is no rationale to imbedd the image itself into this article. On anoher note, if you persist with this, I will ask that the image be deleted from this Wiki for Copyright violation - as there is nothing on the image page itself which indicates it is permissable for us to even be using it. All that said, trying to include that image on any basis, is in my view needlessly provocative and adds nothing to the quality of the article.

Evidently I misunderstood your purpose. I accept your correction that your purpose was to act "against" Gamaliel. My comment above concerned only the article content, however, and should not be taken as an endorsement of anything that is "against" Gamaliel. He and I happen to differ on one particular point, that's all. Gamaliel is one of those people with whom I feel that I can disagree, and have a sincere exchange of ideas, without either of us taking it personally. Although you're right that you and I don't often agree, that we both disagree with Gamaliel on this point doesn't prove that he's wrong.</li>
<li>"guise" - You cite a dictionary giving a <b>primary</b> definition that includes "semblance" (your emphasis). I use <a href="http://m-w.com/" class="external text" title="http://m-w.com/" rel="nofollow">Merriam-Webster's online dictionary</a>, which gives the primary meaning of "semblance" as "outward and often specious appearance or show". It wasn't an insult to your English usage to note that most speakers of English would take "guise" in this context to have a connotation of dishonesty. But, hey, let's not bicker about it. If you think it doesn't have that connotation, fine. You've done a lot of editing of <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a>. That article includes a reference to the "USA PATRIOT Act which greatly expands the government's powers of surveillance and arrest. The act passed soon after September 11, 2001." At the end of that description, we should add "under the guise of fighting terrorism". I think that statement would be accurate. Will you make the edit, or should I?</li>

Simply put, you are attempting to extort me in that if I don't agree with you, you are going to intentionally modify GWB in a controversial way. That's dirty pool. On another point, the operative word which your rebuttal hinges on is "specious" <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/61/64/S0616400.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bartleby.com/61/64/S0616400.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. And in this you are correct. I was indeed inferring that the stated rationale for the inclusion of the "asses" image is specious - and that's why I used the word "guise" - it's a less hostile way of saying basically the same thing. On the other hand, I'll remind you that "specious" and "dishonest[y]" are not the same thing. But of course, you knew that already, which is what makes me think that the arguments you offer here are merely "specious" justifications for hammering your views onto me.

<dd>Rex, you're a one-man advertisement for the POV that the Wikipedia ideal of collaborative editing is a utopian dream. I was neither threatening nor extorting. I would not modify the Bush article in the way I described, precisely because, as I stated, "guise" has a connotation of dishonesty. My opinion that Bush was being dishonest doesn't belong in the article. I was hoping that putting the shoe on the other foot would help you see why "guise" was objectionable. You've now explained that your RfC embodied your opinion that the stated reason for the image was "specious". I agree that's different from "dishonest" but it's still not neutral, so it's still not the right way to frame an RfC. You really ought to become familiar with the rules about different forms of <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDispute_resolution_d69e.html" title="Wikipedia:Dispute resolution">Wikipedia:Dispute resolution</a> -- based on your track record in your first couple months here, you're going to spending a <i>lot</i> of your time on such things. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 23:52, 1 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Turning to the substance, I agree with Gamaliel in rejecting Rex's four-part test. As to the example of Bush giving the speech, that image would help convey an important point about the phrase that is the subject of the article, namely that it had official imprimatur. By contrast, the image now at issue concerns a very minor and peripheral point about the subject of the article, namely that it's been parodied. That's why I didn't find it sufficiently informative. If the "Asses of evil" article had stayed, I'd have no problem with including the image there. For this article, though, I wouldn't include a text statement like "The parody 'asses of evil' has become common enough that it's available on T-shirts and bumper stickers" (although that's true). Including the image really does no more than that. I agree with Gamaliel's analogy to the <i>Unfit for Command</i> image, which I thought didn't belong in the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kerry_b44b.html" title="John Kerry">John Kerry</a> article. So at least I'm being consistent. &#160;:) <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 20:02, 1 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Granted, a very significant portion of the population inside the u.s., and a much larger portion outside, feels this way about the administration. Granted, it is a legitimate parody, and deserves mention. However, I do not think it appropriate to have the picture on here. Esp. it being the only picture. That would be disproportionate. One could put a link to an outside source, and maybe that outside source would have a picture, that would be fine. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_baas_eec8.html" title="User:Kevin baas">Kevin Baas</a> | <a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevin_baas_1af8.html" title="User talk:Kevin baas">talk</a> 18:07, 2004 Sep 1 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Let me be quite clear - I am a British anti-Bush, war demonstrator. I also write topical gags, am a fan of the extremely forthright satirist <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Morris_6188.html" title="Chris Morris">Chris Morris</a> and watch any comedy I can lay my hands on.</dd>
</dl>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Any leading political figure will have been parodied, so there will always be easy access to an image or quote from a comedian that someone can find with minimal effort and then seek to combine into an article.

<p>Rex has deleted this reference in the "Parody" section on the preposterous grounds that it's "POV". (Of course, Rex has no problem with the POV of "axis of weasels" to refer to countries whose foreign policies he dislikes.) Axis of Eve is indeed a political group. Nevertheless, as Gamaliel tried to explain to Rex, mentioning that things exist is not POV. Anyone who stops by here in response to the RfC about the image, and who happens to notice this section, might usefully chime in on this point. I think that the article on "Axis of evil" should report the puns on and variations of that phrase that have achieved notability -- including "axis of weasels" (right-wing POV) and "Axis of Eve" (name of left-wing group). <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 05:18, 2 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Jml, you are mistaken on this "parody" issue - here's why:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>"Axis of Weasels" is an appropriate, non-commercial Wiki link</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>And, the phrase "Asses of Evil" itself, is acceptable, because it is a known play on the term.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However, the link to: <a href="http://assesofevil.org" class="external free" title="http://assesofevil.org" rel="nofollow">http://assesofevil.org</a>, is not appropriate, because this web site is an political activist site ("Thanks to our many volunteers in Boston during the DNC, we sold a lot of shirts, publicized our websites") which sells t-shirts and did not in fact invent the "asses of evil" term. This is inherently POV and there is no POV controversy on this page which invites linking to such material.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Also, "Axis of Eve" is not a bona fide play on the term, but rather is another activist site <a href="http://www.axisofeve.org" class="external free" title="http://www.axisofeve.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.axisofeve.org</a> which simply chose this name as a marketing gimmick. They too sell items such as "Panties with a Purpose". Now selling panties would not in and of itself be an issue, but these particular panties are part of the whole activst M.O. of this group: "Register Eves and Adams everywhere to Vote! Call your local Democratic party office, they can give you the tools and training to do voter registration." This too is not a true parody site, rather it is an activist site masquerading as parody. Also POV same as assesofevil.org.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Finally, in regards to "axis of medieval"; "Christian fundamentalist" is not associated with "medieval" and even if it were, that is too tangental of a sectarian baiting and need not be here - it adds nothing - only stirs up trouble. This one is not even heard of anywhere, I have checked - this is nothing but gratuitious mocking and trouble making.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Frankly, I don't have too much trouble with any of the <b>phrases</b> themselves (except the gratuitious swipe at Christians). But I am going to oppose the links as they are simply too POV, they inject needless controvesy and they are acually activist/commercial sites, not true parody sites.</dd>

<dd>But there two problems with what is being tried here: 1) those two sites are not "parody" sites about Bush's speech - rather they are activist sites against Bush. The other is the fact that these have not merely been "listed" but linked to. Remember, this page is about a phrase and speech which have specific political meaning. Therefore a bona-fde parody must as it's central focus, poke fun at those. These other sites do not have that as their central purpose. They are not "parodies", but organizations which sloganeer in a play-on-words fashion which is being mis-characterized as a parody.

<dd>Regarding links: Personally, i'd like to see links all over the place; little [1]'s and [2]'s. to substantiate the info and allow users to explore. This is the original idea behind hypertext. I don't think that linking or not-linking should be determined by political considerations. Linking is for purely informative purposes - let the information stand as it is, regardless of it's nature or one's particular sentiment to it. That is how to be encyclopedic and neutral. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_baas_eec8.html" title="User:Kevin baas">Kevin Baas</a> | <a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevin_baas_1af8.html" title="User talk:Kevin baas">talk</a> 17:54, 2004 Sep 2 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Intentional insertion of links to political activits sites often times are not needed to make the editorial point. In fact, they can often detract. But if that's the position you take, then I suppose you would have no problems with oodles of links to FreeRepublic.com spread liberally aroundnd the various articles you and I edit?

<dd>Rex071404, I can't help but note that you are suggesting that the specific rule that Kevin_baas proposes be applied generally ("I suppose you would have no problems with oodles of links to FreeRepublic.com spread liberally aroundnd the various articles you and I edit?") Above, when JamesMLane uses that technique to critisize your arguement you refer to it as a "taunt" and "dirty pool". You can't condem the technique in one post while using it in another. <b>That</b> really is dirty pool. <a href="../../../m/a/a/User%7EMaastrictian_523d.html" title="User:Maastrictian">Maastrictian</a> 19:34, 2 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Firstly, let me second Maastrictian's dislike of hypocracy. I would take the side you take in your most recent post, and remain consistent (not hypocritical). But this does not mean, as you therein suggested, that we should spread "oodles of links to FreeRepublic.com" "liberally around the various articles" we edit. The links should be as relevant and specific to the subject matter as possible. Clearly, if an article contains the phrase "Free Republic", refering to the same "Free Republic" refered to by said website, then a link to that website should be provided. On the other hand, where the phrase "Chicago Bears" appears, there should be a link to the Chigao Bears' website, not FreeRepublic.com. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_baas_eec8.html" title="User:Kevin baas">Kevin Baas</a> | <a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevin_baas_1af8.html" title="User talk:Kevin baas">talk</a> 20:24, 2004 Sep 2 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your logic makes no sense - under your scheme, anyone tool with a domain name can get his stuff linked into this Wiki. Under your plan, it would be acceptable to register a domain name of "JohnKerryAintSoSwift.com" and simply because it is "parody" of "swift" and "Kerry" it can get linked to all Kerry/Swift related pages - but of course, allowing such a thing is absurd. In any case, on a sheer "information value" test, the links you lobby for have too little information about the topic at hand - which is the history and usage of the phrase "Axis of evil" to merit their inclusion. I am not going to simply throw in the towel on this. Mentioning these terms is fine, but the links add no editorial value and are POV. Also, the "medevial" link / anti-Christian slur is utter junk and has been fully explained by me. You are in the wrong here.

<dd>I also agree with Maastrictian about applying the same standards to everyone. On that score, I find it particularly humorous that Rex is resisting a link to Axis of Eve on the grounds that it's a political activist organization. Back when Rex was still allowed to edit the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kerry_b44b.html" title="John Kerry">John Kerry</a> article (before the ArbCom issued a temporary block), one of his pet causes was promoting "Swift Boat Veterans for Truth" -- a political activist organization. He made several reverts to try to link to the <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swift_Boat_Veterans_for_Truth_4e54.html" title="Swift Boat Veterans for Truth">Swift Boat Veterans for Truth</a> article twice in the same paragraph, a clear violation of Wikistyle. What's more, our born-again opponent of commercialism not only had no problem with SBVT's commercial activities, but made multiple reverts to try to keep, in the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kerry_b44b.html" title="John Kerry">John Kerry</a> article, an image of the front cover of SBVT's book. By that standard, we should not only keep the Axis of Eve link, we should include in this article a photo of one of the "Expose Bush" panties they sell.</dd>

<dd>I draw a distinction between Rex and Vincent, who has no such history. Vincent, I think your point is advanced in complete good faith, so let me address it. We seem to be agreed that the "Parody" section of this article can report that there's an anti-Bush organization called Axis of Eve, although Rex wanted to delete even that information. I think standard Wikipedia style is that, if we refer to an organization, we link to the article about it; if there is none, we frequently link to an external site. This is so even if the site is strictly commercial, let alone an organization like this one that's primarily political but happens to sell some stuff. We're not so much making the joke as we are letting the readers see that it wasn't just a Jay Leno one-liner, but was played up enough to inspire a substantial organization. For that reason, I think the link adds to the information available to the reader about the subject of the article. It would be too peripheral to this article, however, to replace the link with a detailed description of the Axis of Eve organization. The link lets an interested reader explore it further, without cluttering the article. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 20:48, 2 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't see a need to link to the "asses of evil" site. As far as I can tell, that site is just some vendors trying to sell stuff to capitalize on a popular riff on the phrase. I think there are other versions of "asses of evil" out there, e.g. one including Ashcroft along with the three we name. So there's no entity, i.e., no genuine organization called by that name. Similarly, I don't know of any "axis of weasels" website or organization (though I haven't bothered googling). In each of these cases, our basis for listing the phrase is that it's in common use, probably by more than one person. By contrast, with "Axis of Eve", our basis for listing that variation on the original phrase is that it's a variation that's inspired a notable organization. I think all or virtually all of the thousands of Google hits relate specifically to the organization. Typically, when we mention an organization, we link to it. Axis of Eve is sufficiently notable to merit a Wikipedia article. Until we have one, though, the normal linking style is to link to the organization's own website. (If we had an Axis of Eve article, it would certainly link to the website.) <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 02:44, 3 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Alright, let's be clear, the name of a parody is not POV - it is objective. Also, the description of a parody, as they would describe themselves, is not POV. It is objective. Simply because it may provoke certain emotions in certain individuals does not make it POV. Here we call a cat a cat and a dog a dog. <i>Not</i> doing so would be POV.</dd>

<p>Agreement between 5, 10 or even 100 persons to intentionally include an anti-Christian "description" still does not make it right. Suffice it to say, I am digging in my heels on this one, so if you want Rfc or Mediation or Arbitration, we might as well go for it now.</p>
<p>I especially say this to JML and K. Baas; There is no editorial goal which you seek - fairly balanced with my objections - which is not attended to in my version.</p>
<p>Frankly, I am appalled at the both of you that you would insist on the inclusion of such a slanderous statement as this: ""<a href="../../../a/x/i/Axis_of_medieval.html" title="Axis of medieval">axis of medieval</a>" (the USA for its policies that opponents claim have strong <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_fundamentalist.html" title="Christian fundamentalist">Christian fundamentalist</a> overtones)"</p>
<p>Shame on the both of you! Your version adds minimal editorial benefits, but injects large amounts of needless spite. Well and truely, I am very surprised that the both of you are fighting to include such needless inflammatory language. Suffice it to say, the drive to include that must be aimed at encouraging the snide mocking of our President's faith, or else, why insist that it be written the way you want it written?</p>
<p>Aren't the links and the new "Axis of Eve" page - which I created to meet your objections - enough? Why must I take measures to adjust and bend to the wishes of others here, yet others show no respect for mine? Where is the collegial spirit in that?</p>
<p>Is this how we edit a Wiki - by bullying thoughtful objections into silence?

<dd>Rex, the word "evil" has its origin in religion! Its primary meaning is closely linked to morality and religion, and President Bush chose the phrase, quite possibly because of this. That's reason enough to describe the joke as "mocking the strong religious overtones".

And, of course, as is typical of your tendency to act as if you and only you have any understanding of Wikipedia etiquette and principles, you do so in the name of "collegial spirit".

<dd>You are beating a dead horse - during all that time, I was focused on and working towards reaching consensus. In fact, it was ME who created the "Axis of Eve" Wiki page so we could end the bickering over that. Also, why you insist on dwelling on personal upsets, puzzles me - simple tell me which of my words you take offense at and I will render a thoughtful apology on those words speficially. Now let me turn this around: my facts - in the form of Wiki quote and the Google links I have supplied as proof, are clear - the aim of some here to use "Axis of Medieval" as a slur agaisnt Bush (and other Christians in general) is clearly NOT the basis for that turn-of-phrase, but rather it's a perversion and misuse of it. I am sorry to say this, but any here who support using that phrase to insult Bush's form of Evangelical Christian faith, are indeed advancing a form of bigotry. That is my view and as tactfully as I can, I am going to stand by it. Even so, so as to not keep you waiting any longer, I am sory for upsetting you. Perhaps those here who want to equate modern Evangelical Christianity with the cliche' of backwardness that Medieval "jokes" drive for, will also apologize to me?

<dd>Which of your words I take offense at? "Frankly, I am appalled at the both of you...." where I'm included as one of the two targets of the attack; and similarly "Shame on the both of you!" plus the charge that I was injecting "needless spite" and "inflammatory language", followed by the insinuation that, in violation of "collegial spirit", I was engaged in "bullying". For anyone who sees Wikipedia as primarily an opportunity to advance a political cause, I suppose such flak is considered par for the course, which would explain your mystification at my reaction. For those of us genuinely dedicated to producing a top-quality encyclopedia, however, these are serious charges.

<p>Contrary to the contentions of certain editors here, there is virtually no evidence available to support the "Christian = Medieval" twist as being in any kind of bona-fide or wide-spread usage, let alone supporting it as the definative interpretation of "Axis of Medieval".

<p>Your links are irrelevant. One is a wiki mirror, another an article about British education, the third is a comedic blog entry which has nothing to do with politics (The fourth is a broken link). These aren’t pertinent at all.</p>
<p>Your constant repetition of the fact that you are “quoting a wiki article” as if they were sacrosanct is nonsensical as you yourself have loudly and constantly complained about the content of wiki articles. You’ve ripped a quote out of context and I don’t particularly think the intro to that particular article is well-written in any case.</p>
<p>The middle ages are seen by many as an era of backwardness and superstition and thus “medieval” signifies a lack of scientific knowledge and progress due to the negative influence of religion. Political positions based on, influenced by, or seen as catering to religious views are labeled “medieval” by many because they believe they are based on religion instead of science, logic, or other more deserving criteria or are just simply backwards and don’t live up to modern standards of decency and reason. This has nothing to do with being “conservative” in general, but a particular stripe of religious conservatism. Your sanitized “non-POV” version is simply not complete or accurate.</p>
<p>Now is the position I just described fair? accurate? bigoted? anti-Christian? I submit that these questions are not within the scope of our mission on wikipedia. These are the views of certain people, our mission is to document them, not to pass judgment on them or conclude they are bigoted or unfair.</p>
<p>Your constant misapplication of the NPOV principle to eliminate the documentation of strong views you dislike is not within the spirit of NPOV or wikipedia. Imagine if I went to the <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swift_Boat_Veterans_for_Truth_4e54.html" title="Swift Boat Veterans for Truth">Ass Mockers for Truth</a> article and eliminated all quotes from Schacte and Gardner as “too-POV”. You would probably have a brain aneurysm, but not before you loudly accused me of inserting a pro-Kerry POV by eliminating these documented opinions. In that particular hypothetical case, you would be right. And in the case of this and other articles, that is exactly what you are trying to do.</p>
<p>In short, the application of “axis of medieval” may be anti-Christian, but if it is, it’s irrelevant, not in the scope of our mission to make such conclusions, and doesn’t mean we should not document this supposedly anti-Christian view.

<dd>Huh?? It is not a "quote" that is at issue here. Rather, it is an editor(s) choice of words. As such, we have the choice to use or not use intentionally inflammatory rhetoric. Also, the entire rationale you cite for "axis of medieval" in the 1st place is "parody" - not social commentary, not personal attacks, not editorial mandate. Certainly, the "parody" aspect is covered by including the link - which I am not opposing. Rather, what I am opposing is the editorial choice of words which is too inaccurate and too tenuious of a justification for including your desired insult against Christians. Please see this google link <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22axis+of+Medieval%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22axis+of+Medieval%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">here</a>. One good measure of the bona fide existance and usage of a meme or term is to check Google for total number of "hits". For example "Axis of Weasles" returns over 11,00 hits <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22axis+of+weasels%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22axis+of+weasels%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>, "Axis of Eve" returns <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22axis+of+eve%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22axis+of+eve%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> 3,500 hits, but the term "Axis of Medieval" returns only 1,760 hits <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22axis+of+Medieval%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22axis+of+Medieval%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>. And, a quick review of some of the 1st few hits which come up, do not show any examples of the preferred usage which you cite. Therefore, you have no justification to assert that your interpretation of that "joke" is definative. There is not data to support you view, but there is a Wiki page on this Wiki which clearly has drawn from the one factual referrence on the web <a href="http://www.fact-index.com/a/ax/axis_of_medieval.html" class="external text" title="http://www.fact-index.com/a/ax/axis_of_medieval.html" rel="nofollow">here.</a> That referrence is the #1 google return and it - as does this Wiki on the same named page - uses this verbiage <i>"conservative" political agenda"</i>. That's why I cite it and it's why I am going to continue to oppose allowing the posting of a twisted and amplified version of a virtuallly non-extistant turn of phrase - "Axis of Medieval" to be used on this Wiki by others such as you to assault and insult people on the basis of their faith. Your requested text slanders and causes controversy, and yet, keeping it out does not detract from the article. You may as well go ahead and go for Rfc, Mediation or Arb com on this, because I am not yielding on that point - I already have bent over backwards and led the charge to resolve all the other points (see above). It is now the turn of the others here to bend some as well.

<p>The "reference" you keep citing is a wikipedia mirror and it says so at the bottom of the page, and to use a wiki mirror as an authoritative reference about what you're going to put on wikipedia is like, well, insert the analogy of your choice here, but it's just silly.</p>
<p>Parody is often used for social commentary, as it is with all the parodies in the relevant section of the article. To say that they are two seperate things is a misunderstanding of what parody is. It's not just silly misnamed movie characters in <i>Mad Magazine</i>.</p>

<dd>No you haven't - the quotes you cite do not all support your take that "Christianity = Medieval" and further, none of them referrence this phrase as the form of a "parody". Therefore again you have made my point: You are trying to insert something onto a page where is does not belong. Go to the <a href="../../../a/x/i/Axis_of_medieval.html" title="Axis of medieval">Axis of medieval</a> page itself and put your version of this so-called "pun" phrase there.

<dd>IMO, the references cited all use "Axis of Medieval" as a parody (thus, they don't cite it as such)--it's implicit. As far as "supposed" goes, I don't think Bush or his supporters would contest that his faith has an impact on his policy stances (I can dig up appropriate quotes if I must, but I hope we can agree on this). Thus, any "supposed" influence is in fact an actual influence.

<dd>Not true - unless and until you can cite from personal experience as an Evangelical Christian who has taught Christian Doctrine (as I have) you are not sufficiently informed to be able to explain this: Evangelical Christians (as Bush is) do as a matter of doctrine, look towards the principle of "speaking the truth in love". Now, because we are imperfect, we often flub up (as I do by being harsh at times), but even so, the aim and the princple is <i>truth</i> tempered by <i>love</i>. It simply is not intellectually honest to suggest (even as a "pun") that a Christian leader seeking to do his duty to both God and Country, would adopt, promote or advance an agenda which is aimed towards Medieval patterns or ideas. Such suggestions are non-sense. It's tantamount to suggesting that Christians are live-in-the past dolts who cannot grow with the times. Christians, by doctrine are called to be "in the world, not of it". The concept you are straining to reach perhaps might be labled "ludditism" <a href="http://www.freesearch.co.uk/dictionary/luddite" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.freesearch.co.uk/dictionary/luddite" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>, but that could not reasonably be applied to any but the most clanninsh and narrow strains of Fundemental Christians - certainly not a mainstream Evangelical such as Bush. The simple fact is, regardless of certain editors here having proclaimed "Christian" status, the logic being used against Bush here is indeed starting from a negative assumption about how he views and applies his faith. This is why some here are so quick to conclude that "Christianity = Medieval", when in fact, it does not. And because this group presumes that, they are quick to think that any usage of the term "Medieval" in a "pun" <i>must refer to</i> and <i>only to</i> Bush's faith. It is precisly <i>that</i> stereotypical slur which I am opposing. This Wiki is no place to be advancing stereotypes and slurs. There is not one person here who has yet made the case that the article is harmed by either my preferred edits or by the inclusion of "a supposed" into Meelar's. And more so, even if I alone object about this, that should be enough to show that it's only "supposed" what you are inferring about Bush's faith.

<p>All right, you want discussion, here you have it: The invasion of Iraq should not go on this page, as there never were any links whatsoever between Saddam Hussein's regime and any terrorist organizations. And believe me, I am being objective here, as I know about international law, and personally despised Saddam`s regime, almost as much as I despised the Taliban regime. The terrorists entered the country AFTER the invasion, as part as a resistance movement. The difference between the two regimes is that only the second one harboured terrorists. That being said, the subsequent occupation of Iraq could be considered to be part of the War on Terrorism, although it should be specified that the invasion caused Iraq to be a training ground for terrorists. Furthermore, the "axis of evil" countries not necessarily sponsor terrorism, as is the case of North Korea. It has dangerous nuclear ambitions, but that is not terrorism.

Furthermore, by showing where the countries are located on a map, the uniformed will be readily able to recognize that although nations may belong to the same classifications this does not mean that these countries are bound together in some organization or alliance as most do not share similar geography, culture, religion and politics. Additionally, the original maps (by another individual) I felt where not perfect as they were. For example, the font was not easy to read (for myself) and the colours used did not properly contrast (using large fills of red and blue alone is very difficult for the eye to focus on). Also, Vancouver Island was indicated as an American possession! If the maps I have created are also found to be lacking, or wrong, perhaps readers can suggest ways to improve it. I should think though that my original idea of one map for three articles was flawed; I will create three separate maps in the future. I ask that TJLive, who evidently has some issues with the maps inform me next time when they delete the map what they find wrong with it, instead of just simply writing revert.

(Here's an example, registration might be required: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/31/politics/politicsspecial1/31alito.html?hp&amp;ex=1138770000&amp;en=03153f62a6ddc865&amp;ei=5094&amp;partner=homepage" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/31/politics/politicsspecial1/31alito.html?hp&amp;ex=1138770000&amp;en=03153f62a6ddc865&amp;ei=5094&amp;partner=homepage" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>. Note that they use "Judge Alito", but a Senator is "Mr. Kennedy" and the President is "Mr. Bush".) <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> 15:27, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Wikipedia style is to use the title the first time, to give the information that the person holds that title, but thereafter to use only the surname, without "Judge" or "President" or "Mr." or anything else. In this respect, our style differs from that of the <i>Times</i>. (As an irrelevant aside, the <i>Times</i> uses the surname-only style in its sports section, but not elsewhere.) Of course, we preserve honorific titles in verbatim quotations. We also use titles or first names where necessary for disambiguation, such as a reference to "Clinton" where it might mean Bill or Hillary. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 17:25, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, didn't mean to imply we should be using NYT-style. Just using them as a prominent example where "President" is not used, even though they <i>do</i> consistently use honorifics. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> 18:27, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It is, of course, the common practice in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_of_America_8a5e.html" title="United States of America">United States of America</a> to refer to Mr. Bush as <i>President Bush</i> as he is their President; but it should be borne in mind that the English language Wikipedia is not <i>in</i> the United States of America. Bush is the man's surname; the article on <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilfred_Owen_b582.html" title="Wilfred Owen">Wilfred Owen</a> refers to him as Owen, the article on <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigmund_Freud_d2be.html" title="Sigmund Freud">Sigmund Freud</a> refers to him as Freud, and the article on <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacques_Chirac_001d.html" title="Jacques Chirac">Jacques Chirac</a> refers to him as Chirac. As opposed, indeed, to Lt. Owen, Dr. Freud, and President Chirac. <i>President</i> Bush implies that he is President over whoever is speaking; he is not President of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew_Platts_cbce.html" title="User:Matthew Platts">Matthew Platts</a> 21:48, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I do not believe that it is right to refer to President Bush as 'President Bush' every time he is mentioned. The whole issue of so-called 'respect' for the President is unnerving to me, because it seems to be very overblown and even borders on idolization. I cannot possibly imagine people repeatedly refering to <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Blair_f43c.html" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a> as 'The Prime Minister of Great Britain' or 'Prime Minister Blair' every time he is mentioned. Such an idea as this would seem quite undignified and totally over the top. As a British observer, the hero worship that I sometimes see when Bush appears on TV is very alien to me. He's just a man, not some kind of God. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigdaddy1204_d2e3.html" title="User:Bigdaddy1204">Bigdaddy1204</a> 18:41, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have noticed that some people are repeatedly trying to delete most of the section on <i>criticism of the term</i>, while others are determinedly reverting it back into place again. I think the text should not be removed, as it presents a crucial side of the argument that surrounds the phrase.

<p>Seeing as how all three of these countries are on the Asian continent (albeit two of them are on opposite <i>sides</i> of the Asian continent from the third one), is it necessary to have a map of the entire world at the top of the article?

<p>Should "axis of terror" get its own article? Granted, it needs to be expanded on Wikipedia, but it refers to a serious reality and Israel has referred to it <i>at least</i> twice. Besides the first mention in this article, the Israeli UN ambassador has also mentioned it during ambassadors' speeches about the war a few days ago, and a foreign ministry official also said it here <a href="http://www.iranmania.com/News/ArticleView/Default.asp?NewsCode=44321&amp;NewsKind=Current%20Affairs" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iranmania.com/News/ArticleView/Default.asp?NewsCode=44321&amp;NewsKind=Current%20Affairs" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>. Israel may have used the phrase at other times too.</p>
<ul>
<li>I expanded the <i>axis of terror</i> within this article, but is there at least one article devoted to the alleged relationship between Iran, Syria, Hamas, (and Hezbollah)? This should also go there if so. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinutiaman_4942.html" title="User:Minutiaman">Minutiaman</a> 22:54, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><i>The term “axis of evil” was used by United States President George W. Bush in his State of the Union Address on 29 January 2002 to describe regimes that sponsor terror. Bush named Iraq, Iran, and North Korea in his speech.</i></dd>

<p>I am prticularly bugged by the intro. The intro establishes that the states listed countries as "terrorist sponsoring".

<p>If you really want to find the origin, you'll have to go back to 1246 BC and Troy. Heinrich Schlieman found the Nazi or Ashkenazi emblem there, the Nazi's adopted this Hitite symbol as their own.</p>
<p>But since you've decided to make wikipedia just another extension of political lies, publish and be damned.</p>
<p>The true Axis of Evil is Texas, California, and Washington, D.C. because these are the three that worked together to murder a president and his brother, get a Texan and later too many Texans and too many Californians in the White House where they could create black funds and black budgets and do what all three do best: lie, cheat, and steal.</p>
<p>And that is from a descendant of the Founding Fathers of this country and someone whose families were already here as well as landed in Virgigina in 1606.</p>
<p>You whole credibility is listing like some badly launched ABC or Fox disinformation broadcast originating in the burbs of DC.</p>

<p>By the way, the referral is changed to "Mr." instead of "President" when any American feels that the man elected has become a national and international disgrace, usually before, during, or after impeachment.</p>
<p>You'll find the early congess often referred to presidents they considered traitors as "Mr." instead of "President."</p>
<p>Any man who supports himself with phoney bible thumpers, sends innocent boys off to die so he and his friends can become billionairs, and makes that same stupid good ole boy cry of "Patriot!" is like John Adams putting a $100,000.00 bounty on Thomas Jefferson's head for seditious writings.</p>

<p>I am trying to understand why this article's neutrality remains challenged. The term "Axis of Evil" has been used in the context described. The criticism of the use of the term are fully discussed. There is no obvious pro- or anti- Washington bias in the article. Given the extent to which the POV tag undermines an article, it is important for criticism of neutrality to be explained. Therefore I would suggest that anyone who still believes this article violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> explains why here and a discussion can follow as to whether the tag is still needed.
