I just dropped a passage on infinite logic and the axiom of determinacy. The particular version of infinite logic in which this can be done I'm not sure of. One exists obviously but it may be inconsistent. This is just because the axiom of determinacy may be inconsistent. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarnaby_dawson_0c30.html" title="User:Barnaby dawson">Barnaby dawson</a> 17:54, 24 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes it's possible that a model of ZF has non-standard integers that code for proofs that can't be expressed as normal integers. So a proof of AD's consistancy may require a non-standard integer and so depend on the model of ZF we're in (This would make the independence of AD independent). I don't think that current thinking rules this out as a possibility. It's weird isn't it&#160;:) <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarnaby_dawson_0c30.html" title="User:Barnaby dawson">Barnaby dawson</a> 21:14, 31 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, and I'm not sure I understand that actually (which may be due to the fact that I'm an undergraduate who's only heard a few lectures about axiomatic set theory and the like - despite having an interest in these things, I'm really just a mathematical layman). I mean... if you consider all models of ZF (assuming that there are any at all ^_~), then you can divide them into two classes - those in which AD holds and those in which it doesn't. If one of those classes is empty, then by Gödel's completeness theorem, it follows that ZF implies AD or -AD (depending on which of them is empty). If neither is, then AD is independent of ZF. Or am I making a mistake here somewhere?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And also, different models of ZF with integers that fundamentally differ from those in other models shouldn't play a role here really; as long as the rules of deduction that you use for proofs (and that actually define just what formal proving is) don't change, what can and cannot be proven shouldn't change.</dd>

<p>The text contains: "The axiom of determinacy is independent of ZF (assuming that ZF is consistent); it does not follow from ZF (since AC is independent of ZF), but it is possible to construct models of ZF where AD holds (cf. Jech, Set theory)."</p>
<p>Two of these statements are false. Assuming consistency of ZF the axiom of determinacy cannot be proved to be independent of ZF (in ZF). This is because ZF+AD is eqiconsistent with ZF+"There exist infinitely many woodin cardinals". This implies the consistency of ZF. If ZF implied consistency of ZF+"infinitely many woodin cardinals" then ZF+"There exist infinitely many woodin cardinals" would imply its own consistency and would therefore be inconsistent. It is not possible to construct models of ZF where AD holds without futher large cardinal axioms. In fact (Jech, set theory) makes this point. As such I'm correcting the text. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarnaby_dawson_0c30.html" title="User:Barnaby dawson">Barnaby dawson</a> 12:26, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>It is possible that the axiom of determinacy can be proved false without the use of the axiom of choice.</i></dd>

<p>The above is true in some formal sense; not a serious possibility. It's also true in some formal sense that it's possible PA can prove 0=1.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It's not the same at all. It is quite possible that the Axiom of determinacy is false. And postulating the consistency of the axiom of determinacy it isn't at all like postulating the consistency of PA. We can't get the consistency of the axiom of determinacy without postulating very large cardinals which are also suspect. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarnaby_dawson_0c30.html" title="User:Barnaby dawson">Barnaby dawson</a> 14:40, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again I disagree. It might be better to put a more intuitive proof. But this proof is pretty vital to the article. AD is non standard (although important) and that should be clear. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarnaby_dawson_0c30.html" title="User:Barnaby dawson">Barnaby dawson</a> 14:40, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, it's just a bit long. The fact that AD is inconsistent with AC follows directly from the facts mentioned elsewhere about AD implying regularity properties for sets of reals. That would leave more room to (i) define games better, (ii) say more about where AD fits in the scheme of things, and (iii) more about its consequences, without making the article too long and unfocused.--<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 16:03, 11 July 2005 (UTC)

<p>Okay, I don't understand this article. At all. In fact, I don't think I understand a single sentence beyond the first. Of course, I'm a layman, so I can't expect to understand it fully without some set theory courses (unless it's a bit more basic than I think), but I could at least have some idea of a) what it implies for easily-understandable concepts, b) what direct or indirect practical applications it may have, and c) how important it is in its field, probably in addition to at least some other stuff. Surely this concept is no more advanced than, say, <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_chromodynamics.html" title="Quantum chromodynamics">quantum chromodynamics</a> (at least the latter has a much fancier name&#160;;)), but the latter has an introduction that's mostly understandable to high-school graduates. —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a>) 03:25, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>If the outcome of the strategy considered actually depends upon what the other player does at infinitely many points in the game, then I understand that the cardinality of possible outcomes of the strategy considered will be equal to continuum. Correct me if I am wrong. -- <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeocat_5ac2.html" title="User:Leocat">Leocat</a> 17:55, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, you're right. But the proof is also right, just a bit unclearly written, I think. The set asserted to have cardinality less than c is "the set of possible outcomes of this strategy which we have already decided on". Here to "decide on" an outcome means to decide which player wins that outcome.</dd>
<dd>The language of the proof clearly needs a cleanup. Once you've followed the proof, maybe you'd volunteer to clean it up; you would know what parts of it were unclear to you on a first reading, which should give you a leg up. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 19:26, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I still see the cardinality of possible outcomes of the strategy that we have decided on as continuum, if the outcome depends upon what the other player does at infinitely many points in the game. -- <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeocat_5ac2.html" title="User:Leocat">Leocat</a> 21:26, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're getting hung up on "possible outcomes" whereas you should be focusing on "what we have decided". We're taking the strategies one at a time, in order type c. So for example if c is <img class='tex' src="../../../math/2/e/0/2e0eb3a8fff9c1b8b77ac45a69d2e152.png" alt="\aleph_{17}" />, then at any given stage of the iteration, we have thus far made only (at most) <img class='tex' src="../../../math/e/5/d/e5d3c107e0fa976389a63108ce8fce99.png" alt="\aleph_{16}" /> decisions, and each of these decisions assigns the winner for only one outcome. But there are, as you correctly observe, <img class='tex' src="../../../math/2/e/0/2e0eb3a8fff9c1b8b77ac45a69d2e152.png" alt="\aleph_{17}" /> possible outcomes consistent with the strategy we're currently considering. That's how we know there's an outcome (consistent with the strategy being considered) to which we haven't currently assigned a winner. We assign a winner in such a way that the strategy being considered <i>loses</i>, and move on.</dd>
<dd>When we get to the end, we've refuted all possible strategies. Therefore there is no winning strategy for the game, for either player, and thus AD is false. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 06:03, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let the players be Alice and Bob. For each of Alice's strategies, we choose a sequence of moves by Bob which leads to an outcome (one of the continuum many) which has not yet been decided. Then we decide that in favor of Bob. Consequently, that strategy of Alice's will not be a winning strategy. Similarly, for each of Bob's strategies, we pick a sequence of moves for Alice which lead to an as yet undetermined outcome. We decide that outcome in favor of Alice. Thus Bob's strategy is not a winning strategy. Since neither player has a winning strategy, the game is not determined.

<p>A set A of sequences is determined if there exists an absolutely winning strategy for one of the players, say for Alice. The question is not what happens when Alice does not follow the winning strategy.

<dd>Not sure I take your point. The idea of the proof is to construct such a set <i>A</i>, for which there is <i>no</i> winning strategy. This is done by making sure that, for any strategy Alice might try, there's a play by Bob that defeats it, and mutatis mutandis. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 20:17, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To Leocat: You seem to be assuming that we are given a fixed game. On the contrary, to disprove the axiom of determinacy, we are using the axiom of choice to help us "construct" a game which is not determined. The only difficulty in the construction is the possibility that, when trying to defeat Alice's strategies, we might run out of sequences of moves for Bob; or, when trying to defeat Bob's strategies, we might run out of sequences of moves for Alice. We can use the axiom of choice to order the strategies and outcomes in a way that allows us to avoid running out. <a href="../../../j/r/s/User%7EJRSpriggs_58fa.html" title="User:JRSpriggs">JRSpriggs</a> 10:18, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To JRSpriggs: You "refute" each strategy, but this refutation is only conditional - you have to specify countably many further conditions to make Alice win or lose. When all of these conditions are specified, it may turn out that one of the "refuted" strategies is a winning strategy. -- <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeocat_5ac2.html" title="User:Leocat">Leocat</a> 10:31, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>See <a href="../../../d/e/t/Determinacy.html#Winning_strategies" title="Determinacy">Determinacy#Winning strategies</a>. You do not appear to understand what is meant by "strategy". A strategy for Alice is a function from the set of all possible finite sequences of moves by Bob to Alice's next move following the last move in that sequence. So given a strategy for Alice and an ω-sequence of moves by Bob, we get the entire play of the game, i.e. all the moves of Alice and Bob. There is nothing left to do, but decide who won. There are no "further conditions" to specify. <a href="../../../j/r/s/User%7EJRSpriggs_58fa.html" title="User:JRSpriggs">JRSpriggs</a> 11:47, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have no problem with the concept of strategy. The statement: "If you give me a strategy S then we considered that strategy at some time t = t(S)" is the source of misunderstanding. It should be stated that the "time axis" here is the <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_line_%28topology%29.html" title="Long line (topology)">long line</a> whose length is continuum. -- <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeocat_5ac2.html" title="User:Leocat">Leocat</a> 18:57, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There are two different notions of time here, which may be causing confusion. One notion is the time in the play of the game: Alice's first move, Bob's first move, Alice's second move, Bob's second move, etc.. This time may be indexed by natural numbers. The other notion of time is a stage in the construction of the game: deciding an outcome to refute Alice's first strategy, deciding an outcome to defeat Bob's first strategy, deciding an outcome to refute Alice's second strategy, etc.. This time may be indexed by ordinals less than the <a href="../../../i/n/i/Initial_ordinal.html" title="Initial ordinal">initial ordinal</a> of the continuum. The sentence you quoted refers to this second notion of time. <a href="../../../j/r/s/User%7EJRSpriggs_58fa.html" title="User:JRSpriggs">JRSpriggs</a> 07:41, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I claim that the AD is simply false and can be disproved without AC, so it does not matter that you can construct a proof that uses AC. Let Bob have an almost-winning strategy SB0 which simply produces the sequence of zeros. Let it win against every Alice's strategy except SA0 which can consist in producing a sequence containing all prime numbers. Let SA0 lose against SB1 (which can be producing a sequence containing all powers of 2) and let SB1 lose in all other cases. This simple procedure defines a game that is not determined. -- <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeocat_5ac2.html" title="User:Leocat">Leocat</a> 17:55, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think you should consider all pairs of strategies and make sure that for every strategy there is one that wins against it. This is not very clear from the presented proof. Also, the statement in point 2 about cardinality is false in all cases of strategies that actually depend upon what the other player does at infinitely many points. -- <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeocat_5ac2.html" title="User:Leocat">Leocat</a> 19:28, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Leocat,</p>
<p>I appreciate that you're trying to improve the proof, which has been in need of it for quite some time. But your latest changes are problematic as they stand.</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all, there's no need to iterate through <i>pairs</i> of strategies. Given a strategy for (say) Alice, all you need to find is <i>one</i> play by Bob that beats it. There's no need to consider <i>all</i> of Bob's possible strategies.</li>
<li>Also, it's not clear what you mean by</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>3. Decide that this sequence belongs to A, i.e. s1(T) won against s2(T).</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The problem is that you may already have decided that the sequence is <i>not</i> in A. That's because the same sequence may have been generated by two different strategies, already considered earlier.</li>
<li>Finally, I think the "two notions of time" thing is confusing. I would just avoid talking about "time" entirely. To the extent that I do think of it in terms of "time", I would consider the individual plays of the game to be instantaneous—we aren't really considering anything happening sequentially within an individual game. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 06:52, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>1) There is a need to consider all of Bob's strategies, because we have to make sure that every Bob's strategy will lose against a properly chosen strategy of Alice and vice versa. 2) I think you are right that a given sequence may have been already generated by a different pair of strategies and then it would have been already decided whether it belongs to A or not. I do not see a solution of this problem at the moment. -- <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeocat_5ac2.html" title="User:Leocat">Leocat</a> 18:43, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ol>
<li>Yes, you <i>do</i> have to consider every strategy of Bob's. But you <i>don't</i> have to consider all <i>pairs</i> of strategies for Alice and strategies for Bob. It's enough to alternate between strategies for Alice and strategies for Bob, making sure you refute each such individual strategy. Pairs of strategies never come up.</li>
<li>The proof you modified had a correct solution to this, though it was admittedly not very clearly worded. I think you should go back and look at it and figure out what it was saying. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 18:57, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>What are closed sets or Borel sets of INTEGERS? -- <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeocat_5ac2.html" title="User:Leocat">Leocat</a> 16:26, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Answering the question literally -- the integers are usually given the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discrete_topology.html" title="Discrete topology">discrete topology</a>, so <i>every</i> set of integers is closed and Borel.</dd>
<dd>Trying to read your mind a bit -- when we speak of <i>games</i> whose payoff set is closed, or Borel, we're not talking about sets of integers, but rather sets of sequences of integers. These are given the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Product_topology.html" title="Product topology">product topology</a>. A basic open set is defined by specifying finitely much of the sequence, and taking all possible extensions.</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>Now to the more serious matter: Your proof is still not correct (though it's an improvement over your previous effort). Your second step</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>2. Go through the entire game, generating a sequence {a(1),a(2),...,a(t),...}.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>cannot be carried out, because we don't know what the second player played. You can remedy that by <i>specifying</i> what the second player played, but you need to make sure that the sequence that results is not one for which you've already made an A-or-not-A decision. The cardinality argument of the original proof, or something fulfilling the same function, is going to be needed. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 21:50, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I guess my choice of symbols did not make it clear what I meant - so I changed it to make it clear that we are talking about sequences generated by our procedure together with the currently considered strategy. -- <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeocat_5ac2.html" title="User:Leocat">Leocat</a> 10:55, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So step 2 is not as clear as it could be, but much worse is step 7:
<dl>
<dd><i>Keep repeating with further strategies if there are any, making sure that sequences already considered do not become generated again.</i></dd>

<p>You can start with the set of all sequences and keep choosing elements from it without returning them.

<p>Let G be the set of all sequences of natural numbers.

<dl>
<dd>You're right, it doesn't. The point is, how do you know you don't exhaust G, before you get to the end of the construction? There <i>is</i> a way to handle this; it was there in the original proof. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 20:28, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>There always exists a bijection between sets of the same cardinality, so I do not think it is a problem that you exhaust G before you get to the end of the construction. The problem is to keep constructing sequences and making decisions regarding their membership in A without contradicting yourself. I believe it can be done. I do not see the solution of this problem in the original proof. Also, the cardinality argument in step 2 of the original proof is false, as I already pointed out. -- <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeocat_5ac2.html" title="User:Leocat">Leocat</a> 18:09, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, it was correct; you didn't <i>understand</i> it. Not entirely your fault, as it wasn't clearly written. But it's a key point, and you won't have a correct proof until you <i>do</i> understand it. How do you know you don't exhaust G by the end of the construction?

<p>At any given point in the construction we know that the cardinality of the part of G that has been used is less than continuum.

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>At any stage in the construction of the game G, there are continuum many outcomes (sequences of moves for both Alice and Bob), but the subset of them which have been designated as wins for Alice or wins for Bob is less than the continuum. If we project this onto the sequence of Bob's moves (in the process of refuting Alice's strategies), we see that there are continuum many sequences of moves for Bob, but the subset which have been used is less than continuum many. So we are free to choose a sequence for Bob which has not yet been used; and use it to refute Alice's current strategy. Since the moves for Bob are different than any already designated, the entire outcome (both Alice's moves and Bob's moves) must be different. Similarly when choosing sequences of moves for Alice to refute Bob's current strategy. At the end, any outcomes not yet designated may arbitrarily be designated as wins for (say) Alice. Then all strategies of either player have been refuted and the game is not determined.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If we did not know that the number of outcomes already designated was less than the continuum, we could not be sure that we could choose a sequence of moves for Bob with which to refute Alice's current strategy. So we could not be sure that it was not a winning strategy for Alice. So the game might be determined. <a href="../../../j/r/s/User%7EJRSpriggs_58fa.html" title="User:JRSpriggs">JRSpriggs</a> 08:28, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Things are a little bit more difficult: just because we choose a different sequence of Bob's moves each time we refute Alice's strategy does not guarantee that we do not generate a sequence more than once, because a given sequence of Bob's moves could have been already generated when refuting a Bob's strategy. But there is a simple solution to this problem: each time we refute a strategy, we take projections of the generated sequence onto Bob's moves and onto Alice's moves and we take away both of these sequences from the set of sequences that have not been used yet. -- <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeocat_5ac2.html" title="User:Leocat">Leocat</a> 10:20, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are misinterpreting what I said. I meant that ALL outcomes whether from refuting Alice or refuting Bob would be projected before each selection of a new sequence to refute one of their strategies.
