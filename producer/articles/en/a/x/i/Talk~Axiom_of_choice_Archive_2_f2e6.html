A question on <a href="../../../c/s/t/User_talk%7ECSTAR_c8e3.html" title="User talk:CSTAR">User Talk:CSTAR</a> led to a long discussion of the precise meaning of the independence of the axiom of choice (among other things). By consent of the participants, it was moved here. <a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadykozma_c7d7.html" title="User:Gadykozma">Gadykozma</a> 20:59, 2 Sep 2004 (UTC).

<p>Do Wikipedia articles assume the axiom of choice unless otherwise mentioned? Or should results which rely on choice be marked as such? --Matthew Woodcraft</p>
<p>They should be marked as such. If they're not, fix them. --<a href="../../../t/a/w/User%7ETaw_8bc0.html" title="User:Taw">Taw</a></p>
<p>Pretty much anything I write assumes AC. --<a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZundark_7566.html" title="User:Zundark">Zundark</a>, 2001 Dec 16</p>
<p>I think it is polite, when writing about a central theorem like existence of prime ideals or Hahn-Banach, to mention that it depends on AC, but it is really too much to ask to do the detailed bookkeeping and mention AC for every result which depends on one of those theorems. AC is an accepted axiom in mathematics. --AxelBoldt</p>
<p>This last position seems to be modern practice, at least in the areas of mathematics I'm familiar with. Should we have a note to this effect on the main AC page? --Matthew Woodcraft</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, we should. If you're feeling in the mood, this article really needs an overhaul. I moved some paragraphs here from the set theory article months ago, but no-one has yet attempted to merge it all into a coherent whole. --<a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZundark_7566.html" title="User:Zundark">Zundark</a>, 2001 Dec 16</dd>

<p>Is there any treatment of "life without AC"? I would find this an interesting topic. --<a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakeVortex_215f.html" title="User:JakeVortex">Jeff</a></p>
<p>I agree with Jeff. It could be nice to have, say, something about "dedekind-finite" sets, etc. --Alex, 2004 Dec.</p>
<p>I would really like to see at least a paragraph in this article about the current status of the controversy regarding the AC. Thanks to the specialist(s) who would add this update! <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOlivier_5e7f.html" title="User:Olivier">olivier</a> 03:59 Nov 27, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<p>Of course, linguistic abuses can lead to many so-called "paradoxes". For example, "This is not a true statement." seems paradoxical. Yet, the problem is the use of the pronoun "This" which makes the statement self-referential. When things reference themselves, they are no longer first order. The statement is never "within the system" if it references itself. The reference generates a copy of the system, putting the statement outside of the system. Many higher order systems have no known solutions. J. Todd Chapman</p>

<dd>it's true that it's not true. <a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysdexia_bda0.html" title="User:Lysdexia">lysdexia</a> 22:05, 12 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There isn't much work in this direction (as opposed to continuum hypothesis). Too much of mathematics relies on this axiom. The proofs which do not rely on it are considered to be constructive, and there is some interest in seing if there is a constructive proof in this sense, but there is no controversy about the axiom of choice—there isn't really much to say about it except that it is independent, nonconcstructive but makes life much easier. Continuum hypothesis is almost irrelevant to everyday mathematics and that is perhaps what makes a big difference.</p>
<p>Might help to mention that AC is provably false in Quine's NF though it holds for all the sets one would encounter in "everyday" maths. I'd do it myself but it's much too long since I studied logic. Tom Holbrook 14:39 10 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>The recent edit about stating whether AC is used, and preferring not to use it, is definitely POV. Logicians, and those in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constructive_mathematics.html" title="Constructive mathematics">constructive mathematics</a>—and of course anyone who wants to compute anything, may agree; but it's not the mainstream approach. Post-Bourbaki, one uses Zorn's Lemma and forgets about it.</p>

<dd>It was my edit, and agreed it's tinged by my set-theorist POV. It is equally POV to state without qualification that AoC is accepted as true (since that's not the point), or that it is of no import whether it is used or not. How about something like "Despite this, a minority of mathematicians..." instead of "Despite this, it is common to..." <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOnebyone_4a94.html" title="User:Onebyone">Onebyone</a> 16:50, 20 Oct 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree, though the statement seems phrased to imply that Jerry Bona is more famous than the joke, if that makes sense. I guess <a href="http://www.math.uic.edu/cgi-bin/mscs/people/profile_cgi?pid=BonJ606" class="external text" title="http://www.math.uic.edu/cgi-bin/mscs/people/profile_cgi?pid=BonJ606" rel="nofollow">this</a> is Jerry Bona.

<p>How about renaming that section to 'jokes', and adding the (perhaps anonymous) question 'what's yellow and equivalent to the Axiom of Choice?'? No reason to remove Jerry's name, though. 84.9.18.135 14:34, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Something which might be worth mentioning is that at least some of these consequences of the axiom of choice have been shown to imply the axiom as well (Tychonoff's theorem, for example). I'm not sure which other ones do or don't though. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevinatilusa_8edf.html" title="User:Kevinatilusa">Kevinatilusa</a></p>
<p>Additionally, is conjectures really the right category to put this under? Calling it a conjecture seems to imply that it could be proven someday, which isn't the case here. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevinatilusa_8edf.html" title="User:Kevinatilusa">Kevinatilusa</a></p>

<p>This doesn't seem right to me... first the article says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>For example, a proof could use a set S that was previously demonstrated to be non-empty and claim "because S is non-empty, let x be one of the members of S." Here, the use of x requires the axiom of choice.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This doesn't require AC, does it? X consists of one set, S, and as stated in example 1.:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. Let X be any finite collection of non-empty sets.</dd>
<dd>Then f can be stated explicitly (out of set A choose a, ...), since the number of sets is finite.</dd>
</dl>
<p>--66.219.81.52 00:23, 16 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The example <i>does</i> require the axiom of choice. I'm not sure what your second question is talking about, though. Little x in the example has nothing to do with the big X, which is a set, that you are talking about. Anyway, from a set theory book this is just about as classic as an example can get.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Given a set X that is nonempty, there exists x in X. This requires only predicate calculus, not the axiom of choice.</p>
<dl>
<dd>To <i>use</i> the element in X requires the axiom of choice. Check out this quote from Hayden and Kennison:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Choose ab\in Ab [...] This fallacious argument looks reasonable because of a subtle ambiguity in the phrase 'choose ab\in Ab'. It is certainly true that given any non-empty set S, one can 'choose' an element s\in S. This follows from the fact that there exists and x such that x\in S (as S is non-empty), and from our convention about choosing an entity e for which P(e) whenever it is true that there exists an x such that P(x). Thus, for any one of the sets, Ab, we can 'choose' ab\in Ab. But there is no way we can legitimately 'choose' a dependent variable ab for all b\in B. What is needed is a 'choice function' that will enable us to make many choices simultaneously." (Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory, 1968, p. 50f)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Note, the above quote is from a book and is not covered by FDL. <a href="../../../m/s/h/User%7EMshonle_09cf.html" title="User:Mshonle">MShonle</a> 05:33, 25 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I hope to clear this up very precisely. Given a nonempty set X1, producing an element x in X1 requires only existential instantiation. Similarly, given any finite family of disjoint nonempty sets X = {X1, X2, X3, ...XN}, it does not require the axiom of choice to construct a set that contains one element form each XJ in X. This is only finite reiteration all of which can be done in ZF. Now suppose X is an infinite family of disjoint nonempty sets. If we know of a rule by which we can choose a unique element from each set ("choose the least element" if they are so ordered or something like that) then again we do not need the axiom of choice. It is when we can not construct the set that we need the axiom of choice, which is existential rather than constructive. Thus he says we need the axiom to make many (infinitely many) choices simultaneously.</p>
<dl>
<dd>) By the way, assuming there are only finitely many nonempty boxes, I can easily choose a single element from each using only ZF. This article is misleading.</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>If no one has a problem with this, I would like to add another equivalent formulation of the AC. Stated in its most compact form: "Given infinite sets A and B, every bijective mapping from A to B has an inverse." It's a different take on the principle. Any objections? <a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhyzome_d0d7.html" title="User:Phyzome">Tim</a> 19:54, 2004 Oct 8 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Huh?? Maybe you meant that for every <i>surjective</i> mapping <i>f</i>&#160;: <i>A</i> --&gt; <i>B</i> there is an "inverse" <i>g</i>&#160;: <i>B</i> --&gt; <i>A</i> such that <i>f</i>(<i>g</i>(<i>x</i>)) = <i>x</i> for <i>x</i> ∈ <i>B</i>? As you state it, it doesn't seem equivalent to AC at all. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 20:24, 8 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Arrg. I always get "bijective" "surjective" and "injective" mixed up. I'll have to go back and look at it a little longer. This isn't my formulation, so I'll have to get a little for clarification before I add it... <a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhyzome_d0d7.html" title="User:Phyzome">Tim</a> 00:04, 2004 Oct 10 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Epimorphisms split</i>. Well, that's more compact.</p>
<p>Actually there are books full of equivalents.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Baire's theorem</span></h2>
<p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but Baire's theorem requires only inductive choice. That's quite different than the full axiom of choice. I suggest that it be removed from the list of dependencies. (the <a href="../../../b/a/i/Baire_category_theorem.html" title="Baire category theorem">Baire category theorem</a> page requires checking too). <a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadykozma_c7d7.html" title="User:Gadykozma">Gady</a> 22:10, 12 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The page says "<i>Several central theorems in various branches of mathematics require the axiom of choice (or one of its weaker versions, such as the Boolean prime ideal theorem, the axiom of countable choice, or the axiom of dependent choice).</i>", though, so while it doesn't explicitely list inductive choice as a weaker version, it does state that full AC may not be necessary to prove the heorems listed. -- <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchneelocke_ee99.html" title="User:Schneelocke">Schnee</a> 02:05, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So the page is not <i>wrong</i>, just misleading. These things cannot be wrapped up together — maybe a logician thinks they are all of equal standing (because they are all independent of ZF), but in the rest of mathematics, the axiom of choice has a standing quite distinct from the others. <a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadykozma_c7d7.html" title="User:Gadykozma">Gady</a> 02:42, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. I originally added the above apparently controversial material, though from a different computer and without logging in. Josh Cherry and Sean Kelly are both correct about what I meant by the <a href="../../../s/e/t/Set_comprehension.html" title="Set comprehension">set comprehension</a>, though I'll admit that what I posted may have been quite unclear. I apologize for that, but I do think the material should remain, in a cleaned-up form. The purpose was to demonstrate that even those who follow constructive forms of logic which do not assume the law of the excluded middle are forced to accept this law if they accept the axiom of choice, a well-known and, I think, important theorem. I admit to writing the original proof in a hurry, but hopefully we'll eventually be able to get a much easier-to-follow version onto the page. -<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChinju_e6fd.html" title="User:Chinju">Chinju</a> 06:57, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><br />
The argument I gave was based off of my memory of the one found at the bottom of <a href="http://publish.uwo.ca/~jbell/Axiom%20of%20Choice%20and%20Zorn.pdf" class="external free" title="http://publish.uwo.ca/~jbell/Axiom%20of%20Choice%20and%20Zorn.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://publish.uwo.ca/~jbell/Axiom%20of%20Choice%20and%20Zorn.pdf</a>. I don't know if that makes it clearer or not; if not, perhaps you could mention which part is unclear and I could attempt to explain that more thoroughly. On a different note, Sean Kelly's objection that the choice function is only used on a finite collection of finite sets is a good one, and it took me a while to mull over. I think the resolution is something like this: the Axiom of Choice is classically unnecessary for a choice function in such a case; however, this is not the case intuitionistically.</p>
<p>To see this, consider how one creates a choice function without the axiom of choice for a finite set {X_1, X_2, ..., X_n} of nonempty sets X_1 through X_n. Using finitely many existential instantiations, one can obtain elements e_1 in X_1, e_2 in X_2, ..., through e_n in X_n. Then, naively, one might attempt to create a function f such that f(X_1) = e_1, f(X_2) = e_2, etc. However, this would not necessarily work, for if X_1 = X_2, one needs to make sure e_1 = e_2. So, really, what one might do classically is construct the function f inductively, letting f(X_1) = e_1, letting f(X_2) = e_1 if X_1 = X_2, letting f(X_2) = e_2 if X_1&#160;!= X_2, etc. With the law of the excluded middle, this could be shown to be a well-defined function, since [(X_1 = X_2) OR (X_1&#160;!= X_2)] would be provable. However, without the law of the excluded middle, such a definition wouldn't work, and so, perhaps, it would not necessarily always be possible to create a choice function for a finite set without the axiom of choice, in intuitionistic logic. That seems to me to be the answer for now, anyway, but I'll think about it some more. -<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChinju_e6fd.html" title="User:Chinju">Chinju</a> 18:12, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Suppose, in the case at hand, that I define my choice function by f({0}) = 0, f({1}) = 1, and f({0, 1}) = 0. I presume that the existence of this function is uncontroversial. It does have a larger domain than the elements of {U, V}. However, 1. it is not clear to me that the usual statement of the axiom of choice requires that the domain be minimal and 2. even if it does, I imagine that a modified version that allowed for a larger domain would be equally unacceptable to intuitionists and equally useful to everybody else. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosh_Cherry_99df.html" title="User:Josh Cherry">Josh Cherry</a> 02:06, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I only dabble in intuitionistic thinking, so I'm not sure, but I think the intuitionistic response would be that your proposed function hasn't actually been demonstrated to be a choice function for {U, V}, since you haven't demonstrated U to be {0}, {0, 1}, or {1}, even though this disjunction is, of course, classically easy to show from the fact that U is a non-empty subset of {0, 1} (and similarly for V). So your proposed choice function wouldn't have been shown to be applicable in this case. But I have to think about this some more. -<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChinju_e6fd.html" title="User:Chinju">Chinju</a> 03:43, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Correct. You must embrace madness to see why f is not a choice function. If U = {0} or U = {0,1}, you've already got P or not-P. If in your head you thought of the power set of {0,1} as 2^{0,1}, you've already assumed the law of the excluded middle, and thereby lost your grip on insanity. The section is still a bit opaque though, so I'm changing it. -Mad Dan 17:25, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Perhaps, I'm not following the point here, but it would seem to me that if the axiom of choice is equivalent to the statement "for any two sets S and T, either the cardinality of S is less than or equal to the cardinality of T or the cardinality of T is less than or equal to the cardinality of S" then rejecting the axiom of choice as an axiom does not rendered the statement about cardinalities false but merely renders it unprovable one way or the other (since obviously it must be independent from the other axiom if it is equivalent to the axiom of choice). It would seem to me that the quoted section should rather conclude, "if the axiom of choice is not accepted then there exists sets S and T such that the existance of a one-to-one mapping from one into a subset of the other cannot be shown to exists."

<dd>Certainly the quote is talking about considering the negation of AC. It says as much in the first phrase. I don't personally know if there are people who want to use the negation of AC, but the first sentence of the article claims that there are people who at least explore the possibility of negation of AC. Furthermore, in the context of the quotation, where it is discussing how counterintuitive eg the Banach-Tarski paradox may seem, it may be natural to not only want the Banach-Tarski result to be unprovable, but to actually want it to be <i>false</i>. Certainly there is something appealing about a world where Banach-Tarski is not possible. Negation of AC will give you this. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">Lethe</a> | <a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig">Talk</a> 06:24, May 7, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If we let <i>C(S,T)</i> be the sentence "the cardinality of <i>S</i> and <i>T</i> can be compared", the quoted section states, "AoC iff. ∀<i>S</i> and <i>T</i>, <i>C(S,T)</i> ". So if not AoC, then the negation of the right side follows, i.e. ∃S and T such that <i>not C(S,T)</i>.</dd>
<dd>As for your last statement, rejecting the AoC is the exact same thing as assuming the AoC is false, wouldn't you agree? Since the AoC is an independent axiom, you either have to assume it is true or assume it is false; it can't be proven or disproven from the other standard axioms. If by rejecting the AoC you mean <i>ignoring</i> it, you still probably would want to replace it with new axiom(s), so the question of whether it is true or false is still an interesting one. Perhaps you can add in interesting axioms where the AoC becomes false. Either way, I agree that the quoted section may need some rewording. —<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESean_Kelly_ce0f.html" title="User:Sean Kelly">Sean κ.</a> <a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESean_Kelly_1d9a.html" title="User talk:Sean Kelly">⇔</a> 06:54, 7 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Furthermore, in the context of the quotation, where it is discussing how counterintuitive eg the Banach-Tarski paradox may seem, it may be natural to not only want the Banach-Tarski result to be unprovable, but to actually want it to be false.</i> Possibly, but I've never heard of anyone arguing that the axioms of set theory should be constructed with the specific intent of making the Banach-Tarski paradox false. I think the problem in the minds of some people is that it should not be provably true. I'm certainly no expert on this, and would welcome any quotes from mathematicians or logicians who feel that the negation of the axiom of choice should be postulated, but I don't think it's fair to simply assume that there are any. I personally will be surprised if there's even one.--<a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeathcliff_1655.html" title="User:Heathcliff">Heathcliff</a> 16:17, 7 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well you said you couldn't see the point of the paragraph, and the point is this: AC is counterintuitive, but ~AC is also counterintuitive. As to whether there really are practicing mathematicians who assume ~AC, I've never heard of any. According to the intro paragraph, the schools that explore axiom systems with ~AC exist primarily in the field of axiomatic set theory. That explains why I've never met them, all the mathematicians I know are geometers and topologists. But the paragraph you quoted never claimed that anyone uses ~AC, it only mentions that ~AC may be considered counterintuitive, which is a useful statement, in my opinion. I'm not really sure what you're complaining about. We don't need to find a collections of mathematicians who take ~AC to be true just to justify mentioning that ~AC is counterintuitive (even though I believe it possible that such a collection may exist). -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">Lethe</a> | <a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig">Talk</a> 16:37, May 7, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>As for your last statement, rejecting the AoC is the exact same thing as assuming the AoC is false, wouldn't you agree?</i> I completely disagree. Rejecting it is refusing to accept it as an axiom; assuming that it is false is acceptiing its negation as an axiom. These are fundemently different things. If the axiom of choice is simply rejected then it cannot be said to be either true nor false since it cannot be deduced one way or the other from the other axioms. If it is postulated to be false then obviosuly it is false, but so far as I know no one has ever wanted to do that. I think the section should simply need to be removed because it seems to me to be written from the point of view that rejecting the axiom of choice is the same as postulating that it is false which (unless I'm missing something obvious) is completely incorrect.--<a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeathcliff_1655.html" title="User:Heathcliff">Heathcliff</a> 16:17, 7 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I also disagree. Constructivists do not assume the negation of AC.

<dd>I think we're really just bickering over what we mean by "rejecting". I agree that it's not useful to take the negation of the AoC as an axiom, but it <i>is</i> useful to <i>assume</i> that the AoC is false, in order to explore the consequences. Can't we just rewrite the quote to make that clear?
<dl>
<dd>Clearly, you can imagine any logician writing down the axioms he wants to work with. If he writes down ZF + ~AC, this is a different set of axioms than ZF. Some statements that are undecidable in ZF will be false in ZF + ~AC. So rejecting AC as an axiom is different than assuming the negation. The former is constructive mathematics, and the latter is some funny exploration in axiomatic set theory that is nonstandard, but still interesting. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">Lethe</a> | <a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig">Talk</a> 17:27, May 7, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry for going out of chronological order, but the above is a sufficiently widespread misconception that it should be addressed in situ.

<dd><i>I think it is interesting and appropriate that the negation of the AoC implies something as unusual and unappealing as Banach-Tarski.</i> I personally see nothing interesting about it at all. It simply means that there are theoretical axioms which have never been suggested by anyone (in this case ~AC) that if adopted would lead to unappealing results. Every single statement which is currently unprovable from ZF could be taken as a postulate and all sorts of strangess might result, but unless there's an actual proposal for such an axiom there isn't much point in offering arguments against it.</dd>

<dd>I have a problem with the section as it is because it will lead many people to believe that simply rejecting AC leads to the counter-intuitive result given.

Such an argument misses the real debate because it ignores the real alternative (in this example Kerry) and replaced it with an alternative that is more easily rejected but ultimately irrelevent.</dd>

<dd>Okay, I guess I'm going to make one more argument for it and then not contribute to this discussion, since I believe we all hold the same opinion but just keep contradicting each other for some reason.

<dl>
<dd><i>Those uncomfortable with the axiom of choice might be curious about the consequence of its negation, "There exists some collection of sets such that it is impossible to choose one member from each set." It has been shown that the axiom of choice is equivalent to the statement that for any two sets, the cardinality of one is less than or equal to the cardinality of the other. Therefore, if the axiom of choice is false, then there are sets S and T of incomparable size: Neither can be mapped in a one-to-one fashion onto a subset of the other. Any set theory in which either the axiom of choice or its negation is provable must accept either this counterintuitive result or the Banach-Tarski theorem.</i> —<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESean_Kelly_ce0f.html" title="User:Sean Kelly">Sean κ.</a> <a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESean_Kelly_1d9a.html" title="User talk:Sean Kelly">⇔</a> 23:49, 7 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that the consequences of ~AC should definitely be covered. Yes, merely not taking AC is different from taking ~AC, and the distinction must be made clear. However, the only reason for not taking AC is to allow the possibility that ~AC is true. In any particular model of ZF, either AC is true or ~AC is true. Which type of model should we be interested in? If we were convinced that the kind in which ~AC is true are not what we're interested in, we would take AC as an axiom. Note also that from ZF we can prove that either the Banach-Tarski paradox holds or there exist incomparable sets. There is no possibility of avoiding all such strangeness by ducking the issue by taking neither AC nor ~AC. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosh_Cherry_99df.html" title="User:Josh Cherry">Josh Cherry</a> 13:51, 8 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not so. As the article on <a href="../../../a/x/i/Axiom.html" title="Axiom">axiom</a> insists, an axiom need not be obviously true. Is the parallel postulate obviously true? How about alternative axioms that contradict it that are used in non-Euclidean geometry? But even in the "obviously true" way of thinking about things, implications of the negation of AC are relevant to whether we should take AC as an axiom. If a proposition (such as ~AC) leads to results that are considered absurd, this can be turned into an argument that it is obviously false. If it is obviously false, then its negation (such as AC) is obviously true. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosh_Cherry_99df.html" title="User:Josh Cherry">Josh Cherry</a> 04:06, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

In fact, if you think it's obviously true that any two sets are comparable, then you think that something equivalent to AC is obviously true.

In any event the article needs to make it clear the counter-intuitive result described only comes about if ~AC is taken as a axiom and that it does not result from simply rejecting AC. This may seem obvious to you, but it will not be obvious to some people reading the article because many people will not realize that there are actually 3 posibilities being discussed: accept AC, accept ~AC, reject both.

<dd>Yes, I agree that it must be clear in that paragraph that what we're discussing is the ramifications of the negation of AC, not the "rejection" of AC. The paragraph currently states "on the other hand, the <b>negation</b> is bizarre". So the quote states explicitly that it's dealing with the negation. How much clearer to you want it to be?

<dd>As I believe I've already said it is accurate; it is simply not clear. As I believe I have also already said, the reason it is not clear is that many people will not understand that rejection and negation are two different things (as we've seen in this discussion). Another thing that makes it unclear (and what made it unclear to me) is that I still don't undertand the purpose of it. So while I know that rejection and negation are two different things since rejection is as far as I know the only one of the two anyone has ever proposed I wondered when I read it if the author of that section might himself have confused the two concepts since to me considering the effect of an axiom no one wants seems pointless. Yes I think explaining what negation means will help. I also think epxlicitly stating that it is not the same is rejection and that simply rejecting AC does not lead to the result given would help as well. I'll make the changes myself soon unless someone beats me to it. I wound still prefer that the article also point out that no one actually wants to postulate ~AC (unless of course I'm incorrect and someone does.) But I'll hold off on adding that since there seems to be disagreement over it.--<a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeathcliff_1655.html" title="User:Heathcliff">Heathcliff</a> 23:03, 11 May 2005 (UTC)

That should be crystal clear. There is no reason to think it means anything other than the negation of AC.</dd>

<dd><i>Axioms are things from which theorems follow, not things that are true or false</i> I think we still use the words true and false even if they do not reflect any form of ultimate or absolute truth. Otherwise instead of saying "Statement P is true given ZF" We would say "State P follows from ZF but isn't really true since ZF isn't really true). But I see no point in arguing semantics. The real question I'm getting at is, are there any logicians and mathematicians who want to use ~AC as an axiom? Obviously someone must have taken it as an axiom and investigate the result or we wouldn't have the result quoted on the page, but in my mind that doesn't tell us if there really is any interest in it as an axiom.--<a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeathcliff_1655.html" title="User:Heathcliff">Heathcliff</a> 12:41, 12 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well it sounds to me like you have in mind to remove or at least weaken the discussion about the consequences of assuming ~AC as an axiom, based on a mistaken notion about how axioms have to be somehow "obviously true".

<dd>As I've already said, I'm not going to take anything out of the aticle. I'm just going to explicitely state that postulating the the negation of AC is not the same as rejecting AC and that rejecting AC does not lead to the result sited. You agree that these facts are true so adding them will not weaken the discussion. As for axioms being obviously true: I'll retract that statement since you are clearly correct that anything can be accepted as an axiom if it suits the individual though I'm not sure why you keep coming back to this issue since it has no baring on what I'm proposing to add. I'd hoped that my pointing out that the real question I have is not, is AC or ~AC obviously true, but are there any logicians and mathematicians who want to use ~AC as an axiom? But as I've already said I'm holding off on adding anything about that since there are unresolved objections.--<a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeathcliff_1655.html" title="User:Heathcliff">Heathcliff</a> 22:13, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">P or ~P</span></h2>
<p>All this talk about AC and ~AC has got me to thinking about the statement (P or ~P) which is taken to be true regardless of what P is. But suppose we are using ZF (w/o AC) and P = AC. Then is it really fair to say that AC or ~AC is true. Obviously, I'm not the first person to wonder about this and that's why there are people who reject th law of excluded middle, but it's the first time I've ever thought, of it and it is interesting.

<dd>Yep, in standard logic "AC or ~AC" is a tautology, and always provable. I don't find this troublesome. Either there exists a choice function for every set of nonempty sets, or there doesn't. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosh_Cherry_99df.html" title="User:Josh Cherry">Josh Cherry</a> 04:12, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Which statement is more interesting, "For any P, P or ~P" or "There is P st. P or ~P, but neither is provable." I find the first intuitive, since the law of the excluded middle is logically equivalent to proof by contradiction, which I couldn't imagine living without. Does your comment concern the second or first statement with P=AC? —<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESean_Kelly_ce0f.html" title="User:Sean Kelly">Sean κ.</a> <a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESean_Kelly_1d9a.html" title="User talk:Sean Kelly">⇔</a> 05:18, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Since we cannot prove either statement to be true or false. I also believe that the statement you have made (P is True) or (~P is True) is stonger that (P or ~P) is True. As for P or ~P being a tautology in standard logic, well obviously. I was merely noting that it is not as obviously correct to me to accept it as a tautology as it once was. In other words perhaps standard logic is "wrong".

<dd>I think you answered my question by showing us you're an intuitionist&#160;;). Which is fine, just remember you're giving up proof by contradiction.

<dd>It's funny this discussion came up. At the AMS convention in Atlanta, Paul Cohen and some other were giving a panel on the CH, and I think someone in the audience asked, "What do you think of the following proof: case 1: CH holds, blah, blah, blah; case 2: ~CH holds, blah, blah, blah; in each case, you prove X. Is X true?" I'm not sure what the response was, but the law of excluded middle seems to generate some emotional reactions. The way I understand it, those who work in logic and set theory often take an attitude akin to how we view the group axioms or the parallel postulate. Is the parallel postulate "true"? The question has no meaning. Sometimes, the mathematics that comes about from assuming it is more useful, other times from assuming its negation. Sometimes, you just want to see what happens in neutral geometry. Same thing here. MOST of the time, mathematics will need AC, or some weaker version of it to get by. You're discarding a lot by not availing yourself of it. On the other hand, it's possible to see how much is provable from ZF alone. And it's also possible to see what happens by assuming ~AC or ~(weaker versions of AC). We can do all this without getting caught up in trying to figure out "whether it's really true or not". This is one thing I didn't really "get" at that panel discussion in January...they really seemed to figure that CH or ~CH was some empirical question that we could "figure out" if we just thought about it long enough or something. Or maybe it was all just way over my head. In any case, set theorists and logicians aren't the ONLY people who think about AC and ~AC and various weakened forms of it...people interested in the foundations of analysis (real number system, TVS, functional analysis, descriptive set theory, construction of certain types of real functions) have to deal with these issues directly. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolver_5a6c.html" title="User:Revolver">Revolver</a> 18:37, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>This is one thing I didn't really "get" at that panel discussion in January...they really seemed to figure that CH or ~CH was some empirical question that we could "figure out" if we just thought about it long enough or something.</i> I suppose it dependeds a lot on how you think of a set. Or how do you define an undefined term?&#160;:) It seems to me that some people (perhaps because set is not defined) see it simply as something (anything) to which the axioms are applied. But others tend to think of sets in a more concrete sense. For them I think the question of is there a set whose cardinality is greater that aleph-0 and less than c is not quite as abstract a question. Perhaps I'm talking about constructionist, but I think it's subtler than that (though related). I just think that whether a person is a pure constructionist or not the way he thinks about sets has a big impact on the way he views most questions. I've always thought of sets as physical things. Things that you can actually build with your hands. Like putting numbers in a box. This does not make me a constructionist, but it means contemplating sets that cannot be constructed goes against the natural way I conceive of sets in my mind. And it slants my judgement. But then I think everyone has to deal with this in one way or another.--<a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeathcliff_1655.html" title="User:Heathcliff">Heathcliff</a> 13:08, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The new revisions by 207.75.180.91 make the artcile <b>less</b> clear rather than more. Particularly, "Note that any model of ZF¬C is also a model of ZF, so for each of the following statements, there exists a model of ZF in which that statement is true:" Why does the artcile not make the statement "Note that any model of ZFC is also a model of ZF." The intention seems to be to imply to those not familiar with how logic works that ZF~C is somehow more closely connected to ZF than ZFC is to ZF. My revision was perfectly clear and I only made it after many days of discussion and after it was determined that no one disagreed with the accuracy of what I wanted to add. I did not add additional things which were disputed and then someone shows up out of the blue and makes unecessary revisions that not only eliminate what I clarified but make it more confusing. And I find it interesting that the first editting that 207.75.180.91 does on wikipedia is this!

<dd>And, in response to Michael Hardy below, I think that perhaps I am overly protective of my professional reputation, because I don't have one yet. This is related to the fact that I do not have a high opinion of Wikipedia's advanced mathematics articles; there are so few people out there who really understand such things that it is unsurprising that many of Wikipedia's articles are of doubtful quality. This is less true of the more elementary articles, such as this one; yet the reason I made my edit of 22:34, 28 Apr 2005 was because I thought the article was POV. This is probably a bad example, since the axiom of choice tends to attract <a href="../../../c/r/a/Crank_%28person%29.html" title="Crank (person)">cranks</a>; but also, <a href="../../../r/i/e/Riemann_integral.html" title="Riemann integral">Riemann integral</a> was factually incorrect before my edits of 1 Aug and 2 Aug 2004. (Thanks, by the way, for cleaning up the typography.) Perhaps I am a pessimist, but I can imagine someone reading an article I had edited and imagining that I was responsible for the entire thing, when in fact someone else may have come along later and messed it up, as happened in Riemann integral when someone added the <i>I</i><sub><b>Q</b></sub> example. That's what I have in mind when I want to avoid having my edits attributed to me. I concede that I could do as <a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_ae09.html" title="User:Lethe">Lethe</a> suggests, but as of right now, I don't want to. I suppose that I want to be anonymous even among Wikipedians. 207.75.180.159 01:23, 14 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not so sure it's a result of there are so few people out there who really understand such things as it is that many of the mathematical people here at wikipedia tend to "branch out" into subjects beyond their primary research or what they studied in-depth in graduate school, and so they are often venturing into areas in which they are say, knowledgeable, but not experts. If everyone contributed only to things they were 100% expert in, very little math articles would get written. The result is that mistakes do occur. At this point in time, I would not recommend that someone use wikipedia's math articles as a reference comparable to textbooks or standard references. Maybe this will change some time in the future, but that's not the way I use it now. I use it to get a good read on things, realising that if I want definites on particulars that I want to stake my life to, I should go somewhere else.

<p>Actually I see that the artcile <i>does</i> point out that "any model of ZFC is also a model of ZF", but it's two sections above the section it refers to in a paragraph about proving theroems in ZF without AC nor ~AC. I think part of the problem is just poor layout of the article. Also it seems that someone or some poeple find these two facts--any model of ZFC is also a model of ZF and any model of ZF~C is also a model of ZF--important. Perhaps both should be explained in a new section to make it clear what people are trying to get at. For instance, what is the relevance of these facts and how do they impact the discussion of AC?

<p>I think I see why I was wrong in saying "in all models of ZF¬C"...e.g. there may be a model where countable choice holds, but not arbitrary choice, so in this model, statements which only require countable choice WILL be true, although choice doesn't hold in general. Is this the right reasoning? Can this be explained by someone who maybe understands it better? <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolver_5a6c.html" title="User:Revolver">Revolver</a> 04:43, 14 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>To elaborate, it may be useful to point out which, if any, (I don't know for certain) statements DO hold in all models. E.g. the statement about sequences involving continuous functions seems only to involve countable choice, so it probably doesn't hold in all models, but the statement about vector spaces would seem to hold in all models (isn't it equivalent to choice??) <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolver_5a6c.html" title="User:Revolver">Revolver</a> 04:44, 14 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It's just that "in all models of ZF¬C" is just a more complicated way of saying "¬AC implies".

<dd>I understand my mistake. Thinking aloud again, I really don't like the wording "there exists a model", even if it is now corrected from what I put which was incorrect. The reason as I think was mentioned above, is that it makes it sound like this statement requires ZF~C. We don't say, "there exists a model of ZFC in which every vector space has a basis" is a consequence of ZFC, we simply say "every vector space has a basis" is a consequence of ZFC. If something is really equivalent to choice, then it seems it would hold in any model, and we should say this. On the other hand, the statement about sequences involving continuous functions only holds in certain models (namely, if I think right, those in which countable choice does not hold); it is possible to imagine a model where countable choice holds but not arbitrary choice, in this case, the statement is certainly NOT a "consequence of ZF~C"!, to my mind, a "consequence of ZF~C" SHOULD be a statement that holds in ALL models. Whereas AC has weaker versions, ~AC has _stronger_ versions (the negations of the weaker versions of AC), and it's kind of misleading the way it's worded, it makes it sounds like the statements follow from ZF~C, when really there just a model where it doesn't hold. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolver_5a6c.html" title="User:Revolver">Revolver</a> 05:01, 14 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Okay, it doesn't say "consequences" it say "results requiring", this is technically true, I suppose (the results imply ~AC), but not in the spirit of the first part "results requiring AC". I say this because the first part on results requiring AC allows weaker versions, (not all results there require AC). Moreover, all the results there ARE consequences of AC, since the weaker versions are implied by arbitrary choice. This doesn't happen with ~AC...not all the results are consequences of ~AC...the result about sequences is one example. But the way the two sections seem to mirror each other, the reader is left with this impression. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolver_5a6c.html" title="User:Revolver">Revolver</a> 05:23, 14 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I think I finally hit what bothers me most. Not all the statements under "results requiring AC" actually require AC...some require weaker versions, so the heading here is misleading. It is true that all statements in the ~AC part, without the qualifier "there exists a model", DO require ~AC, in the sense that in every model where the statement holds, ~AC is true. Again, there seems to be a lack of consistency between the two sections. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolver_5a6c.html" title="User:Revolver">Revolver</a> 05:23, 14 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Results requiring ¬AC</span></h2>
<p>This section is still problematic. It asserts that various propositions are true in some, but not necesarily all, models of ZF¬C. I presume it also means to assert that they are false in all models of ZFC. One problem is that this section does not bear the same relationship to ¬AC that "Results requiring AC" bears to AC. But there is a bigger problem than the title. It doesn't make sense to have a section like this in addition to "Results requiring AC". Listing a statement here is equivalent to lising its negation in "Results requiring AC". In fact there is outright redundancy here. For example, saying "There exists a model of ZF¬C in which there is a vector space with no basis" is redundant with listing "Every vector space has a basis" in "Results requiring AC". I'm tempted to remove this section altogether.</p>
<p>What <i>would</i> be useful is a list of important statements that are true in <i>all</i> models of ZF¬C but false in some models of ZF.<small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosh_Cherry_99df.html" title="User:Josh Cherry">Josh Cherry</a></small></p>

<dd>That's just another way of saying "negations of equivalents of AC". I think the way to handle it is to add an "equivalents of AC" section (I was surprised to see that there's not one already), and let people figure out the negations on their own. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 16:15, 23 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>You're right, my bad. Should be "propositions inconsistent with AC". Still, they're just the negations of consequences of AC; should be listed only if they're more naturally stated than their negations are.

<dd>No, they're not (necessarily) inconsistent with AC, and not everything inconsitent with AC is one of them. An example of a statement in the set I have in mind, but not equivalent to ¬AC or inconsistent with AC, is the negation of the generalized continuum hypothesis. Anyway, I take it that you agree that 1. the "Results requiring ¬AC" should not exist in its current form and 2. stronger statements should be made somewhere about important propositions that are true in <i>all</i> models of ZF¬C but not in all models of ZF. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosh_Cherry_99df.html" title="User:Josh Cherry">Josh Cherry</a> 16:44, 23 July 2005 (UTC)

<p>As I understand it, "there is a vector space with no basis" is is such a statement. If so, this is worth noting, but the article fails to do so.

<hr />
<p>One other thing to note here: I wonder if the person who started this section didn't have in mind something more like "Consequences of ¬AC". The problem is, of course, that there almost aren't any. Roughly speaking, ¬AC is consistent with any particular set being wellorderable, so any "local" consequence of AC that you like, is still consistent with ¬AC. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 16:34, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Someone may well have had this in mind. I can only interpret "Consequences of ¬AC" to mean "things that follow from ZF¬C but are undecided by ZF". That's exactly what I'm saying would be useful, unlike what's there. I wouldn't say that there "almost aren't any" such things. "There exists a set that cannot be well-ordered" is such a thing, and an important one.<small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosh_Cherry_99df.html" title="User:Josh Cherry">Josh Cherry</a></small>

<dd>It's some (well, many) particular set in any particular model. It may not be the same set in different models of ZF¬C, but the proposition "there exists..." remains a consequence of ZF¬C. And it's still important. After all, we consider it important that AC implies that specific infinite-dimensional vector spaces a basis, even though we can't say what that basis is (perhaps it's even different in different models of ZFC; I don't know). <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosh_Cherry_99df.html" title="User:Josh Cherry">Josh Cherry</a> 18:08, 23 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, but that's not the same thing. Given a particular vector space, we may not be able to say what a basis for it is, but we can say that it has a basis of von Neumann rank not higher than, I don't know, two more than the rank of the vector space itself. But given ZF+¬AC, there's no way to put a bound on the least rank of a non-wellorderable set. It could be way up above anything we're interested in. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 18:20, 23 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I find it ironic that we're talking about whether consequences of the <i>negation</i> of AC are interesting because they don't clearly pick out the objects whose existence they assert. But that's neither here nor there. The article currently states that, e.g., the existence of a basis for every vector space is undecided by ZF but decided in the affirmative by ZFC. It leaves the reader in the dark about what happens in ZF¬C. Does ZF¬C decide that statement in the negative, or does it leave it undecided? In fact it decides it in the negative. A reader might want to know that. Do you object to informing the reader of that fact? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosh_Cherry_99df.html" title="User:Josh Cherry">Josh Cherry</a> 18:34, 23 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>That fact (assuming it's true) should be mentioned. If you're right about it, it makes the existence of a basis for every vector space an <i>equivalent</i> of AC, and could be stated there.

Obviously this is not a bijection if the sets <i>A</i><sub><i>n</i></sub> aren't all disjoint. For example, if <i>x</i><sub>12;34</sub>=<i>x</i><sub>56;78</sub>=5, then <i>f</i>(1324)=<i>f</i>(5768)=5. Now let's skip duplicates.

In this case, the first element of <b>S</b> is 0, the second element of <i>S</i> is 1 and so on.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">interpenetration</span></h2>
<p>I haven't read the whole section yet, and perhaps I won't understand it all when I do, but it looks the problem with the axiom of choice may be summarized in the idea of 'interpenetration'.</p>
<p>The problem as I see it is, you can pick 1 object from infinitely many bins, but if some bins overlap (as some definitions or sets of defined numbers may sometimes overlap) you end up with many bins, not empty, but sharing '1' object - therefore non-empty, but, between them, they should only have a 'fractional' portion to give, if they were to each give equally to choosing function. So, if you have an 'infinite' set of bins, but a finite set of objects, for instance, you run into a problem, unless the 'portion' of the 'give' of each object is run down to a limit or something.</p>
<p>Other ways to solve the problem might involve 'recursive' or fractal type phenomenon, things that take into account holism and self-similarity, so that reproduction of the same thing again and again doesn't occur - reuse of functions with 'function libraries' and function calls in programs might be an example of this - I mean, something existing only once in a 'direct' form and having other instances occuring as 'links' or 'reflections' of the original. (Note Indra's Net for further info on self-similarity, and Fritjof Capra's "Tao of Physics" for other metaphors created to show similarity between intuitive and rational views of the universe.) Another example might be the idea of 'templates', where other instances are in fact 'transformations' of this template, the transformations not being inherent in the object, but for instance, stored separately, using the 'symmetries' of/between a given template and an object in order to 'compress information'. (something most useful with a complex 'image' type scenario, where only minor changes occur, so mapping the change as a function symmetrical to the original saves on 'raw data' at the expense of additional 'processing').</p>
<p>An example showing this effect might be the idea of decreasing probability of primes occuring as one progresses towards ever larger numbers. ie (2*3*5*7*11*13*17*19...*n)^-1 = probability of there being primes greater than n ... if you instead added 1/2 (probability of number being even) + 1/3 +1/5 +1/7 etc, you would end up with the overlapping probabilities added in, ie even numbers divisible by 3 included in 1/2, again when you consider 1/3 of numbers being divisible by 3 . I hope I'm making sense, I'm not a math wiz, just 'math interested' - I sort of decided to randomly drop a post, since I got caught up in trying to learn some math stuff in wikipedia, and thought there might be something I might actually have a relevant idea about. I'll cross link this post with my blog. Might remove later, depending.</p>

<dd>I don't think this has too much bearing on the axiom of choice (AoC). It is simply an axiom of set theory that you could assume, just like all the other ones. If you have two one-element-sets and you want to make a set containing both elements you will have to do that using some axiom. If there is no axiom (or sequence of axioms) which allows it, then it is impossible. In the same way the AoC allows the construction of some set, only more complicated. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarSch_3340.html" title="User:MarSch">MarSch</a> 09:53, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>More importantly, the text I removed claimed that from ZF+DC+"every set has the property of Baire" you can prove that every set is measurable. That's false. It's true that in the Solovay model, ZF+DC holds, and every set of reals is measurable and has the p.o.B., but it's not true that you can recover measurability from the p.o.B. In fact, ZF+DC+"every set has the p.o.B" is equiconsistent with ZFC, but ZF+DC+"every set is Lebesgue measurable" is stronger (I think the same consistency strength as ZFC+"there exists an inaccessible"). --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 01:29, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

I <i>am</i> sure, however, that the axiom of finite choice is strictly weaker than the proper axiom of choice, so you're right, being able choose one out of every pair of socks does not imply AC. By the way, don't confuse the axiom of finite choice with the finite axiom of choice, which states that for every finite collection of sets there is a choice function.

<dd>“a home page for the AXIOM OF CHOICE --- an introduction and links collection by Eric Schechter, Vanderbilt University” might be a useful external link.
<dl>
<dd>Bertrand Russell’s quote is cited there as follows:
<dl>
<dd>Bertrand Russell (more famous for his work in philosophy and political activism, but also an accomplished mathematician) once said:
<dl>
<dd>To choose one sock from each of infinitely many pairs of socks requires the Axiom of Choice, but for [infinitely many pairs of] shoes, the Axiom is not needed. The idea is that the two socks in a pair are identical in appearance, and so we must make an arbitrary choice if we wish to choose one of them. For shoes, we can use an explicit algorithm --- e.g., "always choose the left shoe."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I excerpted the following text from page 572 of E. T. Bell’s classic book “Men of Mathematics”:
<dl>
<dd>A set is characterized by three qualities: it contains all things to which a certain definite property (say redness, or volume, or taste) belongs; no thing not having this property belongs to the set; each thing in the set is recognizable as the same thing and as different from all other things in the set --- briefly, each thing in the set has a permanent recognizable individuality. The set itself is to be grasped as a whole.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Formally, by the generally accepted Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory’s axiom of extensionality --- that is, two sets are equal if and only if they have precisely the same members — a set is a collection of distinct objects without regard for their order as elements.</dd>
<dd>Thus, it appears to me that the very “definition” of a set as having distinct elements (that is, say, {0,0} = {0}) refutes Russell’s “pair-of-socks” argument as well as the “proof” of Banach-Tarski[-Hausdorff] paradox on axiom of choice.
<dl>
<dd>* In Russel’s “pair-of-socks” example, if the “two” socks in each pair are indistinguishable from each other then there ought to be only “one” sock in each set (“pair”).</dd>
<dd>* In the “proof” of Banach-Tarski[-Hausdorff] paradox in Wikipedia, the decompositions S(a), S(a<sup>−1</sup>), S(b) and S(b<sup>−1</sup>) that “results in four copies of each original element” should be viewed as only one element because, say, {a,a,a,a} = {a}.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>On the other hand, the physical “law of conservation of parity” does not hold in weak interactions so “left” could always be distinguished from “right” — which one could successfully communicate even to an alien in another planet anywhere in the universe (the Project Ozma problem) --- please read Martin Gardner’s “The Ambidextrous Universe”.

<dd>Well, first of all I think the coding you suggest is not really of the essence. We know what it means for two sets to have the <i>same</i> cardinality; cardinality itself, informally, is just the abstraction of that. The fact that we can code a complete invariant for the equivalence relation as a set, is nice, but it's not really what we <i>mean</i> by cardinality.</dd>
<dd>Still, going with the invariant you suggest, I think it's not hard to define arbitrary products of cardinalities. Just take the set of all cartesian products of <i>all</i> choices of representatives, and now close under equinumerosity at minimum rank. If AC holds, this will always be nonzero (provided all input cardinals are nonzero), and conversely, unless I've missed something. I don't see what you mean at all by the sentence about "weird cardinal numbers"; maybe you could give an example. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 02:36, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>"close under equinumerosity at minimum rank" what, exactly? As far as I can tell, the set of cartesian products of representatives of the cardinal numbers we want to take the product of is empty, in general. Are you trying to look for a set equinumerous with an element of the empty set?&#160;:-)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>if you want to say "oh, and if there is no representative, then say it's 0", that's a new rule. even for the product of 0 by 0, there is one choice of representatives (the empty set times the empty set), so the set of all cartesian products is {{}}, and we have a (unique) representative.</dd>

<dd>OK, point taken. It still strikes me as an artifact of coding, though. What we really mean by cardinality is "what's left of a set when you forget everything about it that distinguishes it from a set equinumerous with it". Products are well-defined on those abstractions (which we're not bothering to code as sets), and with that notion of product, the claimed assertion is equivalent to AC. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 03:05, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>The reason I added it is that it seems to provide the formulation in which it is clearest that AC is intuitively true. We don't want the product of nonzero quantities to be zero. If someone doesn't come up with a better formulation, and add that, I'm likely to revert. Some of the comments seem to be ignoring how cardinal arithmetic works, it seems to me. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Ward_Smith_f812.html" title="User:Gene Ward Smith">Gene Ward Smith</a> 08:02, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is written in the language of ZF. A cardinal number, you see, is a set, except two different sets might be the same cardinal number. But that doesn't matter, because all we care about is whether it's empty or not. So the current statement
<dl>
<dd>An arbitrary product of non-zero <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardinal_numbers.html" title="Cardinal numbers">cardinal numbers</a> is non-zero.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>really means
<dl>
<dd>An arbitrary cartesian product of nonempty sets is nonempty.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Which is already in the article. Beyond the sheer unneeded redundancy of it, we need an ad-hoc definition of cardinal numbers and their product (which is unnecessarily complicated in requiring disjoint representatives). The sentence about zero divisors is confusing and unnecessary as well. "Cardinality" and "cardinal number" are used interchangeably without comment.</dd>
<dd>I <b>strongly</b> want this part just to go away. If you absolutely need to discuss cardinal arithmetic in ZF-C, or NBG with the appropriate changes, go write the appropriate article. This is not the place for it.</dd>

<dd>I think that in order to stay, there will need to be a notable publication which chooses to use this as an axiom, as opposed to a result.

<dd>I'm sorry, what exactly is that strongest intuitive argument? That a cartesian product of an infinite family of nonempty sets would be empty is fairly unintuitive; contrived definitions of "cardinal number" don't change this statement, they just obfuscate it. Since the removed section contained mathematically incorrect statements and language that just didn't make sense, yes, it was necessary.</dd>
<dd>Of course, feel perfectly free to disagree with me; if you think you can write the section so it doesn't have those problems, just put it back. But before you do that, please verify it's actually mathematically consistent, defines any nonstandard terms it uses, and doesn't end up being overly long. I'd suggest just putting it up on the talk page first, since we already know there's disagreement about what should or should not go in, and there's no need to have an edit war when we can just have a discussion.</dd>
<dd>But I am going to be bold and remove nonsensical and confusing statements from the article.</dd>
<dd>At present, I'm not convinced that there is a way to construct cardinal numbers in ZF-C (i.e. as sets) and define a product of an infinite family of those without potentially inviting contradictions. Products of finite families are perfectly fine, of course.</dd>
<dd>If you try to avoid those problems by defining cardinality as cardinality of a specific set, then saying two cardinalities are "equal" if their underlying sets are in one-to-one correspondence, products of equals will no longer provably be equal. So products of infinite families are no longer well-defined.</dd>
<dd>Maybe I'm just being stupid and there's a simple way around all those problems - but I haven't seen it here, and I'm pretty sure I wouldn't remove it then.</dd>

<dd>I'm sorry, I meant to write "a contrived definition of cardinal numbers and their infinitary product". I still consider both the lowest-rank definition and the one as the proper class of sets in bijection to the given set as a bit weird; as I showed below, being able to define a consistent infinitary product of cardinalities is equivalent to AC. Assuming ~(AC) (i.e. ZF-C, which is what I wrote) and the existence of such a product thus leads to a contradiction, as I conjectured above.</dd>
<dd>The ordinary definition of cardinals, for me, is the unique smallest von Neumann ordinal in bijection with the given set; in other words, cardinal numbers are those ordinal numbers not in bijection with any smaller ones. That definition is totally unworkable without ZFC, and the other common definition involves proper classes, which I'm reluctant to consider "numbers".</dd>
<dd>Overall, the only part of the above that I agree with is that contradictions in ZF necessitate contradictions in ZFC. However, it is not appropriate to my post, as I was talking about ZF-C, not ZF.</dd>

<dd>What was wrong with the bit about any two sets are the same size or one is larger than the other? That makes perfect sense without cardinal numbers.

<dd>Nothing wrong with that statement. It's listed under "results requiring AC" in the article as equivalent. I wouldn't mind adding "for any two sets, one can be injected into the other" in the statement section, though I'm not sure the non-ZF crowd agrees that that is still the axiom of choice - the proof of the equivalence of WOP, AC, HMP, ZL requires other axioms of ZF, of course.</dd>

<dd>Here is the strongest common sense argument I can see for leaving out the cardinality statement. There are some tribes that are known to only use a very small number of cardinalities, such as zero, one, two and "many". In the statements of the axiom of choice, we are essentially simplifying this to talk only about sets that have cardinalities zero or "one or many". This is enough to define the axiom of choice without the complex machinary that distinguishes between the different variants of "one or many". <a href="../../../e/l/r/User%7EElroch_ff10.html" title="User:Elroch">Elroch</a> 19:36, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not quite sure why that is a "common sense" argument. It can be made precise quite easily. Let the Elroch cardinality |<i>A</i>| of a set <i>A</i> be "empty" if it is the empty set and "nonempty" otherwise. We'd like to define a functorial class "product" from the class of ordered families of Elroch cardinalities to the set of Elroch cardinalities such that
<dl>
<dd><img class='tex' src="../../../math/5/1/7/51719e8cbedcb8d70567e8715929271c.png" alt="\prod_{i\in I} |A_i| = |\prod_{i\in I} A_i|" /></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>but being able to do so is equivalent to AC. Put another way, a "product of an infinite family of cardinal numbers" makes sense only with AC. That's certainly a good argument to the intuition of those who think products of infinite families are somehow natural things to consider. Note, however, that in the special case of countably many finite cardinalities (essentially the case where this definition might overlap with one for countable products of real numbers) which "should" have a finite cardinality as their product, all is still well. That's just the axiom of finite choice.</dd>

<dd>"Put another way, a "product of an infinite family of cardinal numbers" makes sense only with AC." This makes no sense; if you cannot define products you cannot even <i>formulate</i> the axiom of choice in the usual way. If you <i>can</i> define products, then you can define products of cardinals, by using representive cardinals. This is how we would define, for instance, 2 x 3: we take the set of apples and pears, and the set of George, Mike and Alice, and we get (George, apple) ... (Alice, pear)}, six elements. There's nothing mysterious going on here, and we don't need ordinal numbers or the von Neumann assignment. Two sets have the same cardinality iff they are in one-ome relationship, and that's it. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Ward_Smith_f812.html" title="User:Gene Ward Smith">Gene Ward Smith</a> 20:05, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For the general case, note that every nonempty set <i>A</i> can be put into 1-1 correspondence with a set containing {}.

<p>Okay, let me be more detailed here (and wrap around to the first column).</p>
<p>Assume that your statement is correct, and</p>
<dl>
<dd>If for all <i>i</i>, <i>A</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> can be put into bijection with <i>B</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>, then the products of the families are also in 1-1 correspondence</dd>
</dl>
<p>and furthermore, as I claim</p>
<dl>
<dd>every set can be put into 1-1 correspondence with a set containing {}</dd>
</dl>
<p>then, I claim, the axiom of choice is already true. To see this, let {A<sub>i</sub>} be an arbitrary family of nonempty sets. Let {B<sub>i</sub>} be a family of sets in bijection with the A<sub>i</sub> through the maps f<sub>i</sub>:A<sub>i</sub> &amp;rightarrow B<sub>i</sub> Then the product of the B<sub>i</sub> is nonempty, containing ({}). Thus the product of the A<sub>i</sub> is also nonempty, containing (f<sup>-1</sup><sub>i</sub>({})). This proves the axiom of choice.</p>
<p>So, one of the indented statements must fail without the axiom of choice. I think we can agree that it must be the first.</p>

<dd>It is a choice, but it's not an infinitude of choices happening simultaneously. Choosing <i>n</i> elements from a set you know to contain at least <i>n</i> elements is something you can do without (AC): proving that it has at least <i>n</i> elements means that, precisely.</dd>

Specifically, I think you are invoking the axiom scheme of replacement on the predicate "can be put into bijection with a set containing {}" to form B from A, right? Can I invoke replacement on a slight permutation of the same predicate to create, from a set of non-empty disjoint sets, a set containing one element from each? -Dan 02:01, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's offensive because it frequently gets used thoughtlessly with results that are stupid or worse. "For other uses of women, see...". "For other uses of personal lubricant, see...". "For other uses of the axiom of choice" is clearly NOT what was intended, but it's easy for a reader to misconstrue it that way, especially if the reader is not very familiar with Wikipedia customs. The "otheruses" templates are straightjackets that cannot be judiciously adapted to the occasion.

<p>I disagree with the change. In the examples you gave, there would be a legitimate issue, but they don't actually exist like that! Usually the missing article together with the singular form is sufficient to prevent a misreading. This is true for "for other uses of axiom of choice". While I would agree with a change of the template, I don't think this article is the place to do it.</p>
<p>I also disagree with the way the change was done. <a href="../../../d/a/b/Template%7EDablink_fdf2.html" title="Template:Dablink">Template:dablink</a> is quite minimal, and will create a lot of work for people who want it to do something else.</p>
<p>I think <a href="../../../o/t/h/Template%7EOtheruses1_e2f2.html" title="Template:Otheruses1">Template:otheruses1</a> would be more appropriate, unless there is existing policy demanding dablink.</p>

<dd>The category theory equivalents of choice have been left in the section for weaker versions of choice. I believe that this isn't entirely accurate. Basically, a category theoretic version of choice (eg every category has a skeleton) may be equivalent to choice or weaker than choice depending on how large you allow your categories to get. I'm not sure though. It depends on whether you define your categories in terms of sets or not, it's a complicated issue. 03:15, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I’m not sure we want to go there either, mostly because I don’t know the details very well, so I <i>can’t</i> go there (but wouldn't the class form of choice be stronger than standard set AC?). The point is, I have the impression that describing the categorical choices as weaker may be incorrect. With the previous header, we didn't have to worry about, equivalents and weaker were lumped together. Now that we've separated, we may have a mistake. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">lethe</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig">talk</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" rel="nofollow">+</a></sup> 21:28, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm also not at all sure the way the article looks now is all that great. "Every small category has a skeleton" <i>does</i> imply the axiom of choice (because a skeleton for the category of an equivalence relation is exactly a choice of representatives); I believe the argument is similar for "if two small categories are weakly equivalent, they are equivalent".</dd>
<dd>Hate to suggest it, but maybe weasel words would be the best way out? Essentially replace "weaker" by "weaker or equivalent", or have a third section for those statements we haven't (yet) sorted?

<p>I see that JRSpriggs has recently addressed the issue of category theoretic "equivalents" of choice. I'm not crazy about the solution, mostly because it involves doubling all the category results. And I think these statements can also be arranged to be strictly weaker than choice as well, depending on how you define your category. The real problem is that I don't know this thorny issue well enough to simply state the answer.</p>
<p>But here's my suggestion. Create a new subheading (perhaps subordinate to either the equivalent, weaker, or stronger section), labeled <b>category-theoretic equivalents of choice</b> or some such, and put some text at the top of this section which parametrizes our ignorance. Say something like "Depending on the foundational constructions used to define the categories, the following results may be strictly stronger than, equivalent to, or strictly weaker than the standard axiom of choice for ZFC". Some day someone will come along who knows exactly how these results relate to choice, she can elaborate. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">lethe</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig">talk</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" rel="nofollow">+</a></sup> 04:27, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">countable sets</span></h2>
<p>Pardon for interupting, and since no one else has expressed doubt about this yet, I'll assume I'm somehow mistaken and ask for clarification: how does "every countable union of countable sets is countable" depend on AC? It seems to me that, if you have a priori an indexing of natural numbers on the sets and their respective elements, you have a ready-made injection to N x N. And N x N is clearly countable, and explicitly so, by defining, e.g., (i,j) |--&gt; (i)(i-1)/2 + j (by arranging N x N in a 2-dimensional array, and moving down a diagonal until you hit the bottom, start at the top of the next diagonal, etc.) How was choice invoked in any of this?</p>
<dl>
<dd>While the fact that each set is countable means that each set has an indexing by <b>N</b>, it also has infinitely many different indexings by <b>N</b>. You can choose an indexing for finitely many of these sets without choice, but not for all of them at once without choice. The key here is that knowing a set is countable does not give you a privileged indexing. You have to choose one. For infinitely many sets, you have to choose infinitely many times. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">lethe</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig">talk</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" rel="nofollow">+</a></sup> 05:48, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Anonymous forever: Lethe is correct. Classical first order logic only allows you to choose one thing at a time. By repetition, you can get any finite number of choices. But an infinite number of choices would require an infinite proof which would be invalid. The axiom of choice allows you to do the infinite number of choices in one step. By the way, your pairing function on <b>N</b> should be P(i,j) = ((i+j)(i+j+1)/2)+j, if you use zero-based numbering. <a href="../../../j/r/s/User%7EJRSpriggs_58fa.html" title="User:JRSpriggs">JRSpriggs</a> 06:02, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's better, certainly. I'm still not sure it quite explains the well-order issue. For example: the integers do not come "pre-equipped" with a well-order. But an arbitrary collection of sets of integers will have choice functions. On the other hand an arbitrary collection of arbitrary countable sets won't.
