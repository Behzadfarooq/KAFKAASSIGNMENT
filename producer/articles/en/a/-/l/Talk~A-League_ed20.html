Is there any particular reason, <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETancred_11fe.html" title="User:Tancred">Tancred</a>, why you think we should confuse the people most interested in this article into thinking it's a <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_rules_football.html" title="Australian rules football">football</a> or <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_League_bf41.html" title="Rugby League">football</a> competition? <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKesuari_3a0c.html" title="User:Kesuari">Felix the Cassowary</a> 10:37, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry, I've just read yours and <a href="../../../x/t/r/User%7EXtra_5b60.html" title="User:Xtra">Xtra</a>'s talk pages, and I understand your justification. (I was not previously aware that in Sydney, 'football' frequently refers to 'soccer', and I think most Melburnians would be more than a little surprised to hear this.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Nevertheless, 'football' is still a linguistic variable, and still has no place in referring to a specific sport on an inter-regional website in an introductory paragraph. (I realise that consistently, this means it should be replaced (e.g. football-&gt;soccer) or circumlocuted (e.g. football-&gt;aussie rules football) in most other occurrences here. I don't have the time to go off and make all these changes, but I would be in favor of them.) <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKesuari_3a0c.html" title="User:Kesuari">Felix the Cassowary</a> 10:51, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Just a quick note - I haven't had time to look at the talk pages above, but Soccer Australia recently changed its name to the "Football Federation of Australia", and expect all other soccer/football organisations to do the same. Many of the clubs are now FC, indicating that they are trying to push everyone in this direction. However, I have tried to follow it, but when i personally say football to mean soccer, everyone assumes I am talking about rugby league (I am in Sydney by the way). In short, I wish we could put football there, but the truth is most people in Australia still identify it as soccer. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbinomonkey_5636.html" title="User:Albinomonkey">AlbinoMonkey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../a/l/b/User_talk%7EAlbinomonkey_dabe.html" title="User talk:Albinomonkey">Talk</a>)</sup> 22:40, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I feel this game should be called football. It's the official name of the game. Most of the clubs are football clubs. Living in Sydney I can state the rugby league is rugby league, and for many people football is football (Aussie rules is Aussie rules). As it stands at the moment, Foxsports, the SMH, ABC, SBS, the online News Limited papers use the term football. Channel 10 in SYdney seems to vary from day to day at the moment. I don't see why we have to use a nickname for the sport when it's correct (and official) name is football. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETancred_11fe.html" title="User:Tancred">Tancred</a> 03:10, 2005 Mar 2 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Because the name the body that defines the sport uses is ambiguous. 'Soccer' isn't just a nickname. It's the name you'll find in an Australian (or American) dictionary. It's the name that can be used at all levels of formality in Australia (or America). Living in Melbourne, I can say that Rugby is Rugby (and the distinction between league and union is pretty much ignored), football is Aussie Rules ('Aussie rules' is only used to disambiguate, like here), and soccer is soccer. 'Aussie Rules' is just a modifier---it describes a type of football (which was formely known as Melbourne Rules Football when it was only played in Melbourne, and Victorian Rules Football when it was only played in Victoria). The simplest definition of 'football' is that it describes the commonest form of football in the region you're speaking (or you learnt to speak), so it beans football err... Aussie Rules in Melbourne, one kind of Rugby in Qld, the other kind in NZ, soccer in Europe, Gridiron in America, Canadian footy in Canada. (Also, if you want to cite Media, the only thing I can check is the Age, which categorised the article on Melbourne's soccer team signing an ex-Belgiun player as 'Soccer' and, as usual, the pages discussing the AFL and other related topics as 'Football'. I'll try and find more, but I'm not going to sit in front of a telly to watch the news to do it.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In short, I simply don't see why we should use a name that's ambiguous when we have a perfectly valid unambiguous form that we can use. <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKesuari_3a0c.html" title="User:Kesuari">Felix the Cassowary</a> 05:13, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm leaving it alone now. I was about to make the same change you did, realising the futility of this all, but got an edit conflict instead. However, how come the references to organisations with 'Soccer' in their name persist? I don't understand that, and seeing as those are organisations who are fully entitled to choose their own name, doesn't it make sense to call them by their current names? (I don't know the inner workings of the organisations. I know what the name of the sport is—it's soccer—but I don't how the organisations work.) <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKesuari_3a0c.html" title="User:Kesuari">Felix the Cassowary</a> 00:38, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Guys, it's football. Football people know this. Get over it. Allan.</p>
<hr />
<p>I would like to make the following points:</p>
<p>a) Australian "soccer" articles should be consistent with international "soccer" pages and refer to the game as football (e.g. <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002_Football_World_Cup_d916.html" title="2002 Football World Cup">2002 Football World Cup</a>).</p>
<p>b) Where "Football" is part of a name (e.g. xyz Football Club), it should not be renamed.</p>
<p>c) Where the context is not obvious, "association football" or "football (soccer)" should appear in the introductory paragraph. However, where it is obvious (e.g. "<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia_national_football_team.html" title="Australia national football team">Australia national football team</a>" or "<a href="../../../a/-/l/A-League_%28Australia%29_5df9.html" title="A-League (Australia)">A-League (Australia)</a>"), it should not be required. Perhaps it may be required for the A-League club articles as it is important to identify what type of club it is - although this is more a problem for AFL vs FFA teams as rugby clubs tend to identify themselves as such).</p>
<p>d) Soccer is a colloquialism and is a corruption of association football.</p>
<p>e) With regards to the (Australian) media:</p>
<p>Channel 7,9,10 call it Soccer as they don't want to confuse the viewer - remember that 7 used to own the rights to AFL and now 9 and 10 do.</p>
<p>Fox Sports, ABC, SBS and Sky News call it football (although SKY can be variable because it uses stories from channel 7 and 9).</p>
<p>The SMH always calls it football (is it a Mike Cockerill initiative?) The Age varies depending on editor The West Australian varies depending on journalist, but context is usually obvious. (Headlines always call it Soccer and the liftout is called "Super Soccer" because of the alliteration).</p>
<p>I have rarely seen the commercial media call rugby "football" regularly (although I live in Perth, so the only rugby we see is Union - and it is called either Rugby or Union).</p>
<p>Of course in the international media: CNN calls it football even though it is based in U.S. BBC call it football for obvious reasons. ESPN calls it soccer or football depending on which league or match is covered.</p>

<p>I would also like to point out that last week the Daily Telegraph in Sydney launched its "Football" liftout and it contains nothing about Aussie Rules&#160;;) Almost all of the state federations have changed their name to football as well. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETancred_11fe.html" title="User:Tancred">Tancred</a> 00:19, August 20, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p>I think people who love football/soccer get too caught up in this argument. However, I play and referee the sport and call it soccer. Why? Because most Australians will presume you mean rugby league/union or AFL (depending on the state) if you say otherwise. I don't care what the media calls it. If a person honestly thinks that when they call soccer 'football' they are not confusing people they are full of it. I love soccer but it will never be as popular as league, union or aussie rules varients of football. Get used to it!</p>
<p>I'm with you. I love it, but it will always be soccer to me. Why? Because I DON'T agree with FFA's desicion. I don't appericaite being told what I can and can't call a sport. Does this make me less a fan? No it doesn't.</p>
<hr />
<p>While having a list of top scorers is an excellent step, I feel we should actually list the top scorers since Australia has had a national league, so that would included the NSL. For example the English Premier League still counts stats from the days of the 1st Div.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/-/l/Talk%7EA-League_ed20.html" title="Edit section: NSL">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">NSL</span></h2>
<p>This article should be included in the old NSL. In the mid 90's for a season or 2 the NSL was also reffered to as the A-League. The league is under the same boday FFA and doesn't even have a different name. The only difference is there is a different sructure (though the NSL also had a different structure in different era's) and 6 different teams (with all ethnic based teams expelled).</p>
<p>- Actually only 4 different teams (with all ethnic teams expelled).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/-/l/Talk%7EA-League_ed20.html" title="Edit section: Ethnic Cleansing">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ethnic Cleansing</span></h2>
<p>I think there should be a reference to ethnic cleansing in the change over from the NSL system to the A-League system. Succesful teams like South Melbourne, Marconi and Sydney Olympic were refused entry into the A-League for the formation of new teams even though these teams were capable of competing in the A-League at a competitive and financial level. The only two NSL teams to stay were Perth Glory and Adelaide Utd. were 2 of the few non-ethnic teams in the NSL. Newly formed teams like Melbourne Victory also stuggled financially even before this new "league" was formed problem that existing teams like South Melbourne and others would have not had. But they were still overlooked for no other reason but ethnicity. The FFA have made no secret of this often referring to the A-League as a league without ethnic based teams.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Or not. Mono-ethnic teams have never been able to draw crowds close to what is required to maintain an A-League club, and because they only represent a small minority of the population they wouldn't be able to. Therefore they were rejected because of that, and not because of any racist "ethnic cleansing" policy that you are alluding to. So when you finish crying about it, feel free to watch your team's state league games. Oh, and please sign your comments in future. --<a href="../../../d/m/1/User%7EDM1989_df4b.html" title="User:DM1989">[dM</a>] 03:56, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>The above comment is false. Newcastle Utd Jets and New Zealand were allowed to compete in the A-League despite both have far lower crowds then most other teams that were excluded entry. New Zealand actually had the lowest support in the NSL, yet they kept there spot and now have an avarage crowd attendance that rivals VPL teams. Also if non-ethnic teams were so succesful why were so many failures in NSL (i.e. Carlton, Canberra Cosmos, Newcastle Breakers, Paramatta Power, Northern Spirit, Eastern Pride). Each of these teams had big crowds in there first season but then after the novelty wore off they lost there support, just like the A-League will with no loyalty amongst its fans.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The Breakers and Spirit never suffered from a lack of loyalty. They suffered from a lack of money. As someone who worked for NSFC, I can assue you that was the problem. In the clubs 3rd season, there was not even enough money to really let season ticket holders know what was going on. Oh and Eastern Pride were formed out of an Italian club in rural Victoria. Parramatta Power never drew big crowds, everyone knew they were a front for the rugby league team. I believe Carlton suffered the same problems in Melbourne. I would also be interested in you showing me any of the ethnic clubs who had the $5 million and a decent stadium required to apply to join the A-League. Places like Marconi, Summers St, King Tom would never have a place in a decent national league.<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETancred_11fe.html" title="User:Tancred">Tancred</a> 12:36, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>South Melbourne owns its own stadium and if it was given the allowences and opportunities of that of the A-League (most of which did struggle financially) it could of made the $5 million entry. The FFA had to bend over backwards to allow Melbourne Victory in. Victory only had raised $1.75 million of the needed $5 million by the start of 2005. Now the A-League will try take credit for World Cup success of Australia when really it was due to the old NSL (considering most players played in the NSL rather then the A-League). Also the A-League has no junior leagues so the future players of Australia will once again have to be trained and raised by the old NSL teams (currently in the state leagues of Australia). By the way Eastern Pride was formed from Gippsland Falcons which lost it Italian routes by changing its name and began started advertising itself as a non-ethnic club back in 1964.</dd>

<p>Why are NSW getting two more soccer clubs next year when they already have three and Melbourne is stuck with only one? I find this rather unfair and the federation seems to favour NSW for some reason. Only good this, is that it'll divide you fans over so many clubs and Melbourne will be more highly supported because they have only one and everone who supports soccer will be going for the one team in Melbourne. I still find it most unfair. Victoria's population isn't that much lower than NSW and after all, we are called the sporting capital of Australia. (Note, Tancred, please do not answer this. I have no wish to discuss anything with you again).</p>

<dd>I will respond to anything I like Sliat 1981. When Victoria has a second city, with a decent football stadium, i'm sure there will be talks about getting a second football team into Victoria. NSW has 3 A-League clubs as we have 3 citys that can support them. Wollongong is going to upgrade their stadium so I would expect a team there within the next 4-6 years, but as <a href="../../../e/x/e/User%7EExecutive.koala_ebd4.html" title="User:Executive.koala">Executive.koala</a> said, next season there will be no new teams. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETancred_11fe.html" title="User:Tancred">Tancred</a> 01:08, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This arguement has come to my attention on the NRL site and it may help us get the logos back. What you see now is a copy of a person's view on it on the NRL discussion:</p>

<dd>This ludicrous injustice has just come to my attention. In my opinion, the logos are not used in a decorative manner at all, but as the <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html#Images" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Fair Use</a> guidelines state, should be used "for identification".

<p>Frankly, I'm tempted to delete this section en masse. The clubs (with the exception of Perth Glory) are all precisely one season old.

<p>ACtually, that's not true, as New Zealand and Adelaide were NSL teams and Queensland has roots in an older Brisbane team. Beside, it needs no marketeer to create a rivalry between Melbourne and Adelaide in sport (just look at the AFL), or Sydney and Brisbane in sport (i.e. Origin), or between Melbourne and Sydney in <i>anything</i>. You could start Melbourne and Sydney cockroach-racing teams tomorrow and they'd be bitter and irreversible rivals by next week.

<p>I think the section should go. As has been stated, most of the rivalries are geographic and not A-league specific, and the ones that are not are no more than two seasons old, and even some of those are now questionable. For example, the Adelaide-Queensland rivalry may well fade given that Queensland no longer have the coach who originally clashed with Kosmina. <a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMurtoa_b3a9.html" title="User:Murtoa">Murtoa</a> 06:02, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am a partisan in this matter, but I would take another look at the methodology behind the IFFHS rankings before I included them in any article. There are a number of clear flaws in the methodology that work against leagues such as those in the USA and norway, and work in favor of leagues with an extremely low degree of parity (such as, say, the Greek Super League). Basically, if this information is to be included - and the Norwegian and American leagues are to be maligned by it - there needs to be a disclaimer. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Oaf_699c.html" title="User:Bill Oaf">Bill Oaf</a> 07:02, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Further - and please understand that this is not a knock on the quality of the A-league, which I know nothing about - is the A-league really at the level of the Eredivisie already? If so, congratulations. If not (and be honest with me here), this speaks against the IFFHS rankings again, and we must consider whether honest information is really being offered here. If these claims are to be made at all - that is, if the claims of the IFFHS are to be presented in earnest - there needs to be some mention of the very controversial methodology of the IFFHS rankings. I'm not gonna pretend to be impartial on this: the IFFHS rankings are basically phony in my opinion.

<dd>That is very convenient Chuq. The point about that is there are references, which are on my talk page, that refer to both premiers and minor premiers as the terminology.

<dd>The news.com.au article is a news story, and is less likely to be correct than the official site.

Where the official A-League site and the Sydney FC site differ, I would go for the official site - especially as the A-League article is actually ABOUT the champions and premiers - Sydney FC just mentions the term in passing. Not to mention, Sydney being champions and Adelaide being premiers, the SFC writer may have written the article to make the "premier" seem less important than the champion.</dd>

<p>I have re-uploaded and updated my original team colours. These are intended to solely represent the <b>colours</b> of the team and <b>not</b> any logo and/or kit design.</p>
<p>There are two reasons for this:</p>
<p>Firstly - the kits of A-League teams don't have "designs" as such like AFL or NRL teams. They are basically just a main team colour (represented by two bars on my images), with highlights of other colours (represented with one bar each).</p>
<p>Secondly - I have had a lot of trouble with licencing, etc with my AFL designs which had incorporated part of logos or exclusive designs. By using solely colurs as representation, there shouldn't be any problem.</p>

<dd>Ok, on re-reading the article and the edit, there is no mention of promotion/relegation or a 2nd division in the article itself. The news article also said that the reforms are a result of Asia's poor showing in the 2006 World Cup, and "some leagues will be affected more than others", further reducing the likelihood that Australia, the best performing AFC member, will be majorly impacted. From all reports that I can find, I don't think this is bound to have any major effect on Australia. I have reverted, and if further news comes to light that it <i>will</i> affect the A-League, then it can be re-added then. -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 02:47, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"How would the AFC know what is best for the game in Australia?" Australia, by it own request, is now part of AFC not Oceania. It's gotta do what's good for the Asia game not Oceania. The Howard government forced Soccer Australia to reform, now AFC is gonna force FFA to reform. "Why would they revamp a competition that is only 4 years old?" Beacause it doesn't have relegation, promotion and a 2nd divison. It is one of the 10 marked for reform. "I haven't seen it reported in Australian media at all." Soccer gets scant coverage in Australia. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Tri400 (<a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETri400_76c7.html" title="User talk:Tri400">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tri400_aab1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tri400">contribs</a>) 03:44, 19 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>Just to repeat what I said above, the linked article does not mention promotion/relegation or a second division, at all. The statements made in the article are pretty vague and there is nothing to imply how much it will affect the A-League. Regarding media coverage, I agree it doesn't get the same level of coverage as AFL but it does get reported - and this was four days before the A-League grand final which received blanket coverage in Melbourne at least. -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 05:11, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The AFC and FFA have been talking about the future direction of football across Asia for months now. The plan, I as recall it is, for the ACL qualification to be based in part on how strong the national team is. This means Japan, Korea, Australia etc will get more ACL places in the next 1-2 years. AFC want the A-League to expand and so do the FFA. Other improvments already in place is the top 3 nations at the Asian Cup will get direct qualification for the next one. This will mean instead of these teams playing qualification games, they can play friendlys against stronger European, or South American teams. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETancred_11fe.html" title="User:Tancred">Tancred</a> 15:00, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What has population got to do with anything with regards to not having a 2nd divison? Do the 8 clubs have a god-given right to be in the A-League? Are the Preston Lions meant to be playing in the VPL forever?</p>
<p>I thought this was the difference in sanity between Soccer and AFL. Thank god FIFA and AFC never accept misgovernance in their associate bodies or political interference. Tri400 13:20, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>1. In Australia, population and distance has a lot to do the viability of a 2nd division. A 2nd division league would get less support and receive less sponsorship. Combined with the cost of travel across the country, it would make more sense to wait for the game to be better established in this country. Increasing the number of teams is the primary league (A-League) is a higher priority. England has 20 clubs / 60 million people spread over 130,000 km². Australia has 8 clubs / 20 million people spread over 7,741,220 km².</dd>
<dd>2. No, its an FFA given right.</dd>
<dd>3. Seeing as they have Macedonian roots, yes, they will, unless the A-League changes in a major way.
