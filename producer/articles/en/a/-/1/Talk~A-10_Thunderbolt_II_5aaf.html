<p>The part about the Clinton administration being paranoid seems rather NPOV. Perhaps it should be removed? Berrik</p>
<p>Agreed with Berrik. Also it may be noted that for instance Swedish UN soldisrs on the ground benefited from having the A-10's available on call. The intimidating power of airborne support is quite good when the other side does not know what the ROE are for the planes. --<a href="../../../j/-/s/User%7EJ-Star_d4b3.html" title="User:J-Star">J-Star</a> 11:21, 2004 Nov 15 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that the current phrasing may be more POV than required, but I don't agree with complete removal; that restrictive ROE limited the plane's usefulness in that conflict may well be true. We should probably do what we normally should do when expressing a point of view: find someone who said that and quote them. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorven_1e3d.html" title="User:Morven">—Morven</a> 18:18, Nov 15, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article mentions two friendly fire incidents. However, I remember another; two A-10s attacked a refugee camp (with UN guards) on the border of Albania, in front of TV cameras. However, I don't remember any detals. --<a href="../../../a/h/r/User%7EAhruman_c3db.html" title="User:Ahruman">Ahruman</a> 2005-04-04</p>

<p>That doesn't do justice to the gun. There's nothing for a size comparison.</p>
<p>You look at the picture, and you think "cool, it's a 7-barrel gatling gun". It looks like any common 50-caliber gun... except that it's a <i><b>huge</b></i> beast of a gun. The face of that thing is about as big as a human head, but from the picture you might guess it to be only 3 inches (7cm) across. The picture might as well be the gun of an Apache; it looks no bigger without something to compare against.</p>
<p>The ammo is crazy big too. The bullets are about 4 inches long, or about 12 inches when you include the casing.</p>
<p>BTW, the length of the gun should be mentioned. According to my fading memory, the gun is 23 feet long. It runs the length of the plane.</p>

<p>I would definitely agree with 24, the 50 cal on the thunderbolt is huge, it is one uber big gun. there definitely needs to be a comparison, i suggest going to a museum and getting a picture taken with an object that we would find large, maybe a hand or something so we can see that the gun is one big gun. <a href="../../../z/e/e/User%7EZeetoboy_648a.html" title="User:Zeetoboy">Zeetoboy</a> 16:15, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>"The A-10 has received several nicknames from its enemies. In the first Gulf war 1991, captured Iraqi tankcrews called it: "Whispering Death" (a nickname that has also been attributed to the WW2 Bristol Beaufighter). In the 2003 defeat of conventional Iraqi forces, captured Fedayeens referred to the A-10 as "the Devil's Cross" a name that was also used for it in Tom Clancy's Red Storm Rising (1986). Captured Taliban and Al-Qaeda fighters referred to it as 'the silent gun'. The rounds hit their target before the target heard the report of the gunfire" Is there a valid source for what it appears to be politically incorrect propaganda?, i mean we know that in middle east they are somewhat backwards, but to be as backwards to call a plane "whispering death"?... its not like they would call a train iron horse either.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I highly suspect that this is propaganda or soldier stories. The name "whispering death" has been attributed to Corsair and Beaufighter as well and AFAIK there is no historical evidence whatsoever that it was actually used by the enemies. The same goes for "the Devil's cross," particularly seeing how Tom Clancy used the term 5 years prior and I suspect US servicemen read Clancy more than Taliban fighters. I will pull it until someone can come up with references. - <a href="../../../e/m/t/User%7EEmt147_6c59.html" title="User:Emt147">Emt147</a> <a href="../../../e/m/t/User_talk%7EEmt147_88d0.html" title="User talk:Emt147"><small><sup>Burninate!</sup></small></a> 00:12, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd heard that 'Whispering Death' was the Nickname the NVA, and VC gave the F-111.

<dl>
<dd>One man with no credentials to speak of made an unreferenced and uncited claim, probably because he heard it from someone else. I will revert all "whispering deaths" with a vengeance unless someone can present an actual source for this. It's a myth that has been perpetuated for different aircraft since at least World War II because it sounds cool and makes for a good story. There is no truth that I know of behind it. Beaufighter and Corsair had large non-turbocharged radial engines with straight exhausts. F-111 runs on two massive afterburning turbofans. A-10 again runs on turbofans and has the aerodynamics of a school bus. Whispering my ass. The only airplane I know of from WW2-to-present time period that could be genuinely quiet is a P-38 Lightning at slow cruise because the large turbos very much muffle the engines and the aircraft is aerodynamically clean. And yet, no one ever claimed P-38 to be called that. - <a href="../../../e/m/t/User%7EEmt147_6c59.html" title="User:Emt147">Emt147</a> <a href="../../../e/m/t/User_talk%7EEmt147_88d0.html" title="User talk:Emt147"><small><sup>Burninate!</sup></small></a> 00:03, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Actually the A-10 is one of the quitest aircraft I had worked on in my time in the service... The only time you hear it is when it passed by you. The gun noise is the same way, its quite until after the bullets hit. I am not reverting anything, just pointing out that just because it is a jet aircraft doesn't mean it loud.```` Drew1369 07:58, 17 September 2006</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Drew. I don't have your background/experience with as many planes, but I MUST say that you sure hear these bad-boys coming. I live close to Willow-Grove Naval Air Station in PA, home to the PANG's 111th Wing of A10s. And believe me....I hear them coming. It's to the point where I know if it's a single plane, a double, or a quad flight. Luckily, they don't do 'live fire' exercises in my area.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Possibly but I was also around f-15 and f-16's as well and the a-10 was music to my ears... like I said it is the quitest bird in the inventory minus the stealth fighter and bomber <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrew1369_8794.html" title="User:Drew1369">Drew1369</a> 15:16, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I heartily agree with Drew. The A-10 is an exceptionally quiet aircraft. And I must add, to the individual who lives near Willow Grove (as opposed to working on them, like myself and Drew), consider this: You may hear the aircraft approaching, but by the time you hear it, you've been within range of it's weapons for quite some time. If it WERE to fire on you, you would more than likely not live long enough to hear the roar of the engines.</p>

<li>This quote needs, at the very least, a citation: <i>"Stories of enemies using fearsome nicknames to describe their opponents weapons are sometimes propaganda. For instance, during World War 2, the Allies claimed that Axis soldiers described some of their planes as "whispering death" and "flying porcupine," when in fact it was an invention to obliquely suggest the fearsomeness of Allied weapons."</i> The presence of this paragraph <i>insinuates</i> that such nicknames reported for the A-10 in recent years are just that, propaganda. Unless there is specific evidence suggesting that this may be the case in this instance, I think this paragraph is totally superfluous and should be deleted. Furthermore, I suggest that those purported nicknames be deleted unless and until a reliable source can be found and cited. --<a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskari_Mark_f87e.html" title="User:Askari Mark">Askari Mark</a> | <a href="../../../a/s/k/User_talk%7EAskari_Mark_1910.html" title="User talk:Askari Mark">Talk</a> 03:36, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I chopped out this phrase: "and its ability to engage targets with supersonic ammunition from distances that preclude hearing the incoming rounds before they impact." This is needless because all fired ammunition is supersonic and hits its target before impact. All bullets, cannon shells etc. travel faster than the speed of sound (332 m/s). You'll never hear a bullet before it hits you, even if it's fired from 20,000 ft. While falling bombs can theoritically be heard, there is no indication they are any quieter coming from an A-10. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 204.187.154.49 (<a href="../../../2/0/4/User_talk%7E204.187.154.49.html" title="User talk:204.187.154.49">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_204.187.154.49_f4dc.html" title="Special:Contributions/204.187.154.49">contribs</a>).</small>

<p>Here's the deal. To the guy who says he hears the A-10s "all the time," you're hearing them operating around an airfield. During DESERT STORM, ENDURING FREEDOM, and IRAQI FREEDOM, the A-10s flew much, much higher than if they were landing or taking off. Additionally, there are usually other things going on (explosions, gunfire, etc.) that would preclude you from hearing the aircraft in its usual operating environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, the sounds you're hearing are of the A-10 landing and taking off, two states in which the engines are operating at higher than normal levels, which makes them louder. I've been in the field with A-10s flying and shooting around me, and you DON'T hear them.</p>

<p>Because of this high position of the engines the thrust line would act above the longitudinal aerodynamic axis so to avoid nuisance trimming measures the engine tailpipes are angled at nine degrees upwards bring the combined thrust line down through the centre of gravity.</p>

<dd>Yes, the last portion only. The engines as a whole are raised up at the front for several reasons; inference with the wing, reduced risk of FOD, structural necessity. Therefore if the tailpipes where straight the aircraft would always experience a nose down pitching moment, not desirable especially if the pilot is incapacitated. The pipes at the back are angle 9 degrees upward to bring the thrustline ahead of the engine down to where the aircrafts aerodynamic centre is, or at least nearer. I can't remember the source of this information I've taken it from a project I did over a year ago. It may have been "Jane's". I have a picture that I have edited to try and explain this a little clearer. It's not 100% accurate but it explains it a bit better, but for some reason it's not uploading.

<dd>Actually, the A-10 <i>was</i> designed around the GAU-8 (with its armor-piercing DU ammunition). The plane could not carry any guided ordnance other than the self-guided Maverick until the Pave Penny pod was incorporated.

<dd>The pave penny pod is a guidence aid it doesn't designate or guide weapons to targets. The pave penny pod itself is only a laser receiver... not a laser designator which means it requires the laser to be shot from another source like a grunt on the ground or a laser pod like LANTIRN or LIGHTNING from another aircraft. AND the main purpose of the pave penny pod was actually designed to point the plane in the direction and angle of attack to fire the gun at maximum range <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrew1369_8794.html" title="User:Drew1369">Drew1369</a> 15:40, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"The A-10 Thunderbolt II was offered to the Pakistan Air Force as part of a package including the F-20. They opted to buy the multirole F-16 instead." This really doesn't say much about the A-10 itself. They could have gone with one plane over two for maintenance reasons, or perhaps they just didn't like the F-20.

To satisfy arms control advocates, the F-20 and F-16/J79 were developed to be offered to "third-world" countries instead of the most modern capabilities.

<p>I am certain that the A-10 has not been deployed to Iraq since the initial invasion in 2003 and maybe a few months after that.

<p>A related legend (I can't verify it) is that there's a pod-mounted 30mm cannon that they tried on the A-10 in addition to the main gun. One was mounted under each wing and it fired at the same time as the main gun. Allegedly, the recoil from three such cannon firing simultaneously caused the A-10 to immediately stall.</p>

<p>A-10 data sheet at Air Force Web site: www.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=70. By John Andrew Prime jprime@gannett.com The A-10, the tough little ground-attack fighter that struck hard in combat in the Persian Gulf and other trouble hot spots this decade and last, will soon get a much-needed upgrade.</p>
<p>Over the next six years, all 356 airplanes in the inventory will be upgraded to the new mark, getting "glass cockpits" that do away with old analog instruments, and gaining state-of-the-art computer and control systems that will allow them to use the most modern and "smart" weapons.</p>
<p>The new A-10C will be unveiled today at Hill Air Force Base in Utah, while the type will first fly Nov. 4 at Eglin Air Force Base, Fla., and at Nellis Air Force Base, Nev., according to a release from the Air Force.</p>
<p>"The new designation from A-10A to A-10C represents the largest and most sophisticated modification in the 30-year history of the close air support fighter," the Air Force release said.</p>
<p>Since the local 47th Fighter Squadron trains pilots and isn't a frontline fighting unit any longer, its 21 airplanes will likely be among the last to get the upgrades. But the thought of supercharging the airplanes excites fliers here.</p>
<p>"The most intriguing part is the incorporation of the latest technology, going from instruments of the 1960s and 1970s to something more state-of-the-art," said Col. Ozzie Gorbitz, commander of the 917th Operations Group, part of the Air Force Reserve's 917th Wing at Barksdale Air Force Base.</p>
<p>"The glass in the cockpit and getting rid of round dials will allow us to take advantage of data that's coming through the new targeting pods, and fully integrate these. Overall, we'll have a more capable airframe and will be able to better prosecute the war on terror."</p>
<p>An industry team led by Lockheed Martin developed the upgrades after a request for changes from Air Combat Command. Changes consist of a new cockpit instrument panel with two 5-inch-square multifunction color displays and a new stick-type grip and right throttle to provide fingertip control of aircraft systems and targeting pod functions, the Air Force said.</p>
<p>In addition, six pylon upgrades will allow the new A-10 to employ such advanced weapons as the Joint Direct Attack Munitions, or JDAM, and the Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser, WCMD, in addition to current weapons in its arsenal: the Maverick missile, a 30-mm Gatling gun, and laser-guided bombs.</p>
<p>Finally, a new computer called the central interface control unit will manage the airplane's avionics and the integrated Digital Stores Management System, or DSMS, that controls weapons.</p>
<p>Gorbitz, who previously was with the 47th Fighter Squadron and has close to 1,500 flight hours in the A-10, has seen the new cockpit configuration at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Ariz.</p>
<p>That will be the prime training location for the A-10C, he said.</p>
<p>"Pilots coming here who have follow-on assignments to the A-10C will continue to train in our A-10s and then will receive 'top-off' training in the A-10C, most likely at Davis Monthan," he said. "We will continue to train A-10 pilots going to units who do not yet have the A-10C."</p>

<dd><s>Yes, the A-10's</s> upward-curling wingtips are Hoerner wingtips. They're intended to reduce induced drag by throwing the tip vortex outward and upward; droop tips are curved down, rather than up, and do mostly the same thing (as well as reduce the ground effect). They are useful Winglets are just like the name suggests — little wings appended upwards or downwards from the wingtips. Unlike the "curled" wingtips, they aren't used to reduce drag but rather to generate a thrust component from the vortex's movement over the airfoil. They are useful on aircraft that routinely fly at high altitude and or at large angles of attack. <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskari_Mark_f87e.html" title="User:Askari Mark">Askari Mark</a> | <a href="../../../a/s/k/User_talk%7EAskari_Mark_1910.html" title="User talk:Askari Mark">Talk</a> 23:07, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Obviously, as I grow older my "brain farts" are becoming more common. The A-10 has drooping wingtips, not Hoerners; they curl <i>down</i> on the A-10, not <i>up</i>.

<dd>My understanding of the function of winglets is just the opposite: that they <i>are</i> there to prevent the formation of drag-inducing wingtip vortices. The air is moving more rapidly over the top of the wing than the bottom, so when the air that moves out over the top of the wing meets the air moving out under the bottom it "curls" over, producing a vortex. Wingtip vortices have the same low-pressure center found in tornadoes and the eye of hurricanes, and this low-pressure zone induces drag through suction.--Molon Labe 00:55, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Take a look at <a href="../../../w/i/n/Wingtip_device.html" title="Wingtip device">Wingtip device</a>; it states that <i>wingtip devices increase the lift generated at the wingtip, and reduce the lift-induced drag caused by wingtip vortices, improving lift-to-drag ratio.</i> Turning to <a href="../../../w/i/n/Wingtip_vortices.html" title="Wingtip vortices">Wingtip vortices</a> we find the statement <i>"air flows from below the wing and out around the tip to the top of the wing in a circular fashion. This leakage will raise the pressure on top of the wing and lower the overall lift that the wing can produce. It also produces an emergent flow pattern with low pressure in the center surrounded by fast moving air with curved streamlines."</i> So my description of how the drag is induced is incorrect; the drag is presumably not from any suction effect from the low-pressure zone in the center of the vortex, but rather from high-pressure air spilling over the end of the wing to the upper surface, spoiling the lift-inducing low pressure zone above the wing. I also forgot that wingtip vortices curl upward not downward. My bad. --Molon Labe 01:15, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While the statement of Friendly Fire incidents is true, I don't think this belongs in this page in this manner. Something under the guise of "The A-10 has been involved in several prominent friendly fire incidents" and provide references would be sufficient.<a href="../../../b/q/z/User%7EBQZip01_f891.html" title="User:BQZip01">BQZip01</a> 19:48, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Seems like it is the same as reporting accidents with airliners. Got to cover the bad and good. The incidents could be moved out of that secion and just included in the service history chronologically. What do others think on this? -<a href="../../../f/n/l/User%7EFnlayson_bdc0.html" title="User:Fnlayson">Fnlayson</a> 20:20, 20 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>All I'm saying is that it seems out of place and is of almost no note with regards to the aircraft. In war, people die, sometimes through friendly fire. <i><b>Every weapon system has this problem in war</b></i>. However, the weapon of choice need not be skewered (I don't see any notes like this on the Maverick page, M-16 page, grenade pages, etc.). That said, the incident and all particulars could (and possibly should) be included in the friendly fire page or its own page (should size warrant it). Heck, I don't care if someone starts a page for the PEOPLE responsible, but don't lambaste an inanimate object.<a href="../../../b/q/z/User%7EBQZip01_f891.html" title="User:BQZip01">BQZip01</a> 20:26, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I understand it is a weapon and can be used in the wrong way. I don't haev any better ideas. I'll go along with anything reasonable here. -<a href="../../../f/n/l/User%7EFnlayson_bdc0.html" title="User:Fnlayson">Fnlayson</a> 20:37, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I say we delete it. It is trivial that it was an A-10 that was used and the aircraft and its facts should simply be what they are: facts. If an A-10 was used for something unique or of particular note (such as shooting down a airliner on a diplomatic mission), then it should be included, but these incidents are only noteworthy in the fact that they made page 6 of the New York Times and then were, quick frankly, forgotten. I say remove the note altogether or add it for every weapon system that has caused friendly fire casualties.
