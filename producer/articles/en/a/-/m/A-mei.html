<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/-/m/A-mei.html" title="Edit section: Background">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Background</span></h2>
<p>A-mei is an ethnic <a href="../../../p/u/y/Puyuma_people.html" title="Puyuma people">Puyuma</a>. Like most <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwanese_aborigines.html" title="Taiwanese aborigines">Taiwanese aborigines</a> she was exposed to <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_of_Taiwan_143f.html" title="Music of Taiwan">tribal music</a> during her childhood. A-mei's mother used to record herself singing and then play back the tape for her daughters to hear. A-mei had always been fascinated by music; she once said she stuck to the radio and would rush to watch the late night music program introducing English songs when she was a little girl. She also showed great eagerness to perform in public, forcing her friends to listen to her sing.</p>
<p>A-mei first connected to the entertainment business by joining the televised "Five Lights Singing Contest" by <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwan_Television_2be1.html" title="Taiwan Television">TTV</a> in 1994, after encouragement by her father, who was ill at that time. A-mei made all her way through to the finals but eventually lost in the final round. She felt very disappointed and most likely to quit her interest in music competition. A-mei's father then told her "you definitely can sing and perform songs beautifully, why don't you join the competition again to show that you got a talent in music?" So A-mei was encouraged and then decided to make a second attempt in the following year. This time her stable and superb performances were much appreciated by the judges, and A-mei was awarded the champion. Unfortunately, Amei's father passed away before her victory, making A-mei sad and aimless until she began to sing in pubs with a <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_band.html" title="Rock band">rock band</a> formed by her musician cousin. She was later discovered by the popular singer/producer <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chang_Yu-Sheng_8066.html" title="Chang Yu-Sheng">Chang Yu-Sheng</a> (張雨生) and started her career.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/-/m/A-mei.html" title="Edit section: 1996-1999: Commercial Success and Instant Popularity">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1996-1999: Commercial Success and Instant Popularity</span></h3>
<p>In July 1996, A-mei and Chang Yu-Sheng together sang the single "The One Who Loves Me the Most Hurts Me the Most,"(最愛的人傷我最深), drawing notice to A-mei. In November, A-mei was invited to sing "I'm a Dreamer on Air" (空中的夢想家), the theme song of Taiwan UFO radio, her fresh and powerful voice captured much attention from public. A-mei was then signed to Forward Music and hit stardom with her debut "Sisters" (姊妹), released in December of the same year. The album topped the Taiwan <a href="../../../i/f/p/IFPI_4529.html" title="IFPI">IFPI</a> chart for a record of 9 consecutive weeks and earned tremendous success in the Chinese speaking world. The album had a sales figure of 1.08 million copies; one of the very few albums that has sold over a million copies in Taiwan. The first three songs in the album, "Nothing You Want After All" (原來你什麼都不要), "Sisters" (姊妹), and "Released" (解脫) are widespread.</p>
<p>Following the big hit, A-mei's second album "Bad Boy" in June 1997 was another boom, besides topping the Taiwan IFPI chart for another 9 consecutive weeks, the sales figure of the album even surpassed that of "Sisters", reaching 1.38 million copies, which is the second highest in <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwan.html" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a> history. Again, songs in the album, especially "Can't Cry" (哭不出來) and "Listen to the Sea" (聽海) are regarded as classics of the Chinese pop music in the 90s. In October 1997, A-mei released the CD single "Listen to You, Listen to Me" (聽你聽我), as a memorial to her producer Zhang Yu Sheng, who died in a serious traffic accident. In December, she released the innovative album "A-mei Live in Concert 1998 Prelude", exposing the songs to be performed in her coming concert.</p>
<p>Soon afterward, A-mei began her 1998 Asia tour concert, stopping at <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_6282.html" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore.html" title="Singapore">Singapore</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaysia.html" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a> after the highly reputable initial show in <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taipei.html" title="Taipei">Taipei</a>. Along with her astonishing vocals, her vigorous and infectious performances on stage became her trademark and further established A-mei's status as a <a href="../../../d/i/v/Diva.html" title="Diva">diva</a> of Chinese pop music. Because of her fame, A-mei was invited by Japanese TV <a href="../../../n/h/k/NHK_c31c.html" title="NHK">NHK</a> to represent Taiwan to perform in the annual ceremony "<a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a> Live Dream" in February. In October 1998, she released the album "Holding hands" (牽手), exploring different genres and demonstrating her vocal versatility. Though detractors commented that A-mei's voice was not as clear as in previous albums, "Holding Hands" (牽手) remained hot-selling and was one of the best selling albums in the year. In November, she was named the most popular singer in <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a> by <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billboard.html" title="Billboard">Billboard</a> magazine. Meanwhile, the documentary about the "fable" of A-mei, produced by <a href="../../../c/n/n/CNN_2435.html" title="CNN">CNN</a>, was telecasted worldwide.</p>
<p>In January 1999, A-mei became the endorser of <a href="../../../s/p/r/Sprite_%28soft_drink%29.html" title="Sprite (soft drink)">Sprite</a> in <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_China_8363.html" title="Greater China">greater China</a> and <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore.html" title="Singapore">Singapore</a>. She sang the Chinese commercial song, "Give Me Feelings," (給我感覺) for the brand. In June, she released "Can I Hug You, Lover?" (我可以抱你嗎愛人), the album with a 80s style single and the Japanese song "Want to See You So Much" (好想見你), aimed at accessing the <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_culture.html" title="Japanese culture">Japanese</a> market. Like her previous albums, it sold incredibly and captured numerous Chinese music awards. In the following months, A-mei held her second <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a> Tour concert, "Mei Li 99" (妹力99), visiting various cities in <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwan.html" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a> and other Asian cities, such as <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_6282.html" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore.html" title="Singapore">Singapore</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/i/Beijing.html" title="Beijing">Beijing</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shanghai.html" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>, etc. It was notable that there were nearly 80,000 attendees at the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shanghai.html" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a> show. In September, benevolently, she sang "Love, Never Disappears" (愛, 永遠不會消失), a song composed by <a href="../../../w/a/n/Wang_Lee-hom_bf9c.html" title="Wang Lee-hom">Wang Lee-hom</a>, to commemorate the "<a href="../../../9/2/1/921_earthquake.html" title="921 earthquake">921 earthquake</a>" (also known as <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chi-Chi_earthquake_47b1.html" title="Chi-Chi earthquake">Chi-Chi earthquake</a>) and donated her concert earning from the night in Singapore.</p>
<p>Later of the year, A-mei made the cover of <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asiaweek.html" title="Asiaweek">Asiaweek</a> titled, "The A-mei syndrome".</p>
<p><a name="2000:_The_Arduous_Year"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/-/m/A-mei.html" title="Edit section: 2000: The Arduous Year">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">2000: The Arduous Year</span></h3>
<p>Initially, the year began without issue. In January, A-mei performed <a href="../../../s/p/r/Sprite_%28soft_drink%29.html" title="Sprite (soft drink)">Sprite</a>'s new Chinese commercial song, "I Want to Fly" (我要飛). Because of her healthy image, A-mei was selected as one of the twelve celebrities to participate in an anti-smoking campaign. In March, she had two shows in <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_6282.html" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a> with the <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_Philharmonic_Orchestra_e8ba.html" title="Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra">Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra</a>, singing a wide variety of songs, including Mandarin, English, Taiwanese and Cantonese classics.</p>
<p>However, A-Mei became the subject of considerable political controversy after performing the ROC <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_anthem.html" title="National anthem">national anthem</a> at the first presidential inauguration of <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chen_Shui-bian_a9be.html" title="Chen Shui-bian">Chen Shui-bian</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_20.html" title="May 20">May 20</a>, 2000. This angered the PRC government, which subsequently banned her from visiting <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mainland_China_7f88.html" title="Mainland China">Mainland China</a>. Under pressure from <a href="../../../b/e/i/Beijing.html" title="Beijing">Beijing</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/r/Sprite_%28soft_drink%29.html" title="Sprite (soft drink)">Sprite</a> also buckled and cut its contract, replacing A-Mei as its endorser. Radio stations in mainland China ceased broadcasting her music.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, her fans were aware that A-mei's voice had gradually become weaker and duller. Concerned that her voice had been overused due to her nearly unbroken recordings and concerts, fans banded together and wrote to Forward Music, requesting A-mei be given a break. The company eventually agreed, and right after the promotion period of "A*Mei with <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_Philharmonic_Orchestra_e8ba.html" title="Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra">Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra</a>" live album, A-mei seized the opportunity, by going to <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a> and resting for several months. A-mei became active again in December, with her album "Regardless" (不顧一切).</p>
<p><a name="2001-2003:_Return_With_Fortitude"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/-/m/A-mei.html" title="Edit section: 2001-2003: Return With Fortitude">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">2001-2003: Return With Fortitude</span></h3>
<p>A-mei made the cover of <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newsweek.html" title="Newsweek">Newsweek</a> in January 2001, with the heading "Back In The Spotlight." This made her the first and only Taiwanese singer to grace the cover of the magazine to date. "The lithe 28-year-old singer has been absent from the stage for six months, and her loyal fans--not just in <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwan.html" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>, but all over Asia--are pining to see her again." That was months after being banned from <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a> in 2000, after her performance at the inauguration of Taiwan's newly elected president, <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chen_Shui-bian_a9be.html" title="Chen Shui-bian">Chen Shui-bian</a>. At this point, since her debut, A-mei had sold more than 8 million copies in the past four years and drawn more than 420,000 audiences from all around Asia to her "A-mei Live in Concert 1999 Tour."</p>
<p>In June, A-mei signed a contract with <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warner_Music_741b.html" title="Warner Music">Warner Music</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwan.html" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>. During the ceremony, A-mei expressed her gratitude to her previous record company, Forward Music, for guiding and nurturing her to achieve what she has achieved, and showed her anticipation and excitement for the musical journey ahead with her new record company. A-mei sang the Mandarin theme song for the movie, "<a href="../../../p/e/a/Pearl_Harbor_%28film%29_b157.html" title="Pearl Harbor (film)">Pearl Harbor</a>" (排山倒海) and included it in her next album, "Truth" (真實), which was released shortly after.</p>
<p>In 2002, A-mei won the "Best Female Vocalist of the Year" with the album, "Truth" at <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwan.html" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>'s most prestigious, "Golden Melody Awards." A deserving win after four years of consecutive nominations in the same category since her second album, "Bad Boy." Also a performing guest, she put up a showcase titled, "Best of <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a>" that evening. In the same year, she won "Favourite Artist - <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwan.html" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>" in the first MTV Asia Awards held in <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore.html" title="Singapore">Singapore</a>.</p>

Asian Heroes 2002: Taiwanese Pop Sensation, A-mei by TIME</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>A-mei was named as one of the 20 Asian Heroes featured in the special issue of <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_magazine.html" title="Time magazine">Time magazine</a> in 2002. This made her the first <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwanese_people.html" title="Taiwanese people">Taiwanese</a> singer to grace this international publication. In the interview, she discussed her music, on the incorporation of <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tribal_rhythms.html" title="Tribal rhythms">tribal rhythms</a> into some of her pop songs, such as "Sisters," which celebrates matriarchal aboriginal society. She discussed her career and personal struggles caused by controversial, politically-driven issues. Also mentioned in issue was A-mei's attitude towards her successful music career and her ability to keep her feet firm on the ground, despite her <a href="../../../d/i/v/Diva.html" title="Diva">diva</a> status.</p>
<p>In October 2002, A-mei released her new album, "Fever" (發燒) and shortly after, kicked off her "A-Class Entertainment World Tour," hitting <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwan.html" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_6282.html" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mainland_China_7f88.html" title="Mainland China">Mainland China</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore.html" title="Singapore">Singapore</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaysia.html" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a> and the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S.A_cc15.html" title="U.S.A">U.S.A</a>.</p>
<p>In June 2003, A-mei released her new album titled, "Brave" (勇敢) and in the name of the album, she held three concerts on the beaches in <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taitung.html" title="Taitung">Taitung</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/o/Kaohsiung.html" title="Kaohsiung">Kaohsiung</a> and <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taipei.html" title="Taipei">Taipei</a>. Being the spokesperson for A3 (<a href="../../../k/o/r/Korea.html" title="Korea">Korean</a> PC game), A-mei sang the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandarin_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Mandarin (linguistics)">Mandarin</a> theme songs for A3, titled, "Brave" (勇敢) and "Seeing Myself" (看見自己). Both tracks were included in the album.</p>
<p>In November, in remembrance of her musical mentor, the late singer/producer Chang Yu-Sheng (張雨生), A-mei participated in the tribute album "City of Joy," singing the work of her mentor, "Tears and Whispers" (哭泣與耳語) and performed in the tribute concert along with some other Taiwanese singers.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/-/m/A-mei.html" title="Edit section: 2004: Center of Cross-strait Controversy Again">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">2004: Center of Cross-strait Controversy Again</span></h3>
<p>In February, A-mei received the "Favorite Artist: <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwan.html" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>" award on the MTV Asia Awards held in <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore.html" title="Singapore">Singapore</a>.</p>
<p>In June, A-mei was forced to cancel a concert in the eastern Chinese city of <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hangzhou.html" title="Hangzhou">Hangzhou</a>, China after a protest accusing her of supporting <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwan_independence.html" title="Taiwan independence">Taiwanese independence</a>. About 100 <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_nationalism.html" title="Chinese nationalism">Chinese ultra-nationalists</a> held up banners and chanted: "Oppose Taiwan independence, unify <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>."</p>
<p>Back home in Taiwan, A-mei was under the fire from individuals who championed Taiwanese pride. The Vice President <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annette_Lu_0e00.html" title="Annette Lu">Annette Lu</a> even questioned the patriotism of the pop <a href="../../../d/i/v/Diva.html" title="Diva">diva</a>. Outraged Taiwanese netizens called for a tit-for-tat <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boycott.html" title="Boycott">boycott</a> of China's singers. Meanwhile, Premier <a href="../../../y/u/_/Yu_Shyi-kun_8e40.html" title="Yu Shyi-kun">Yu Shyi-kun</a> offered a clarification of his own previous remarks about the singer. He explained that his remarks were intended to criticize China, and that he had not intended to criticize the singer herself. He argued that local media had misquoted him.</p>
<p>While politics and showbiz are not exactly bedfellows in <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a>, A-mei made it clear that she has no intention of engaging in anything irrelevant to her profession. In response to the uproar, A-mei called on the media to cease its sensational reporting and to end their distortion of her words. "What we really need is more peace and love in our society," she reinforced.</p>
<p>Political issue aside, A-mei gave a benefit concert in <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taipei.html" title="Taipei">Taipei</a> for the victims of the tropical storm Mindulle, which caused widespread destruction in the same month. The concert was free, but each audience member was asked to make a donation of US$30.</p>
<p>On July 31, A-mei set foot on <a href="../../../b/e/i/Beijing.html" title="Beijing">Beijing</a> once again and held a successful concert, with an estimated 10,000-strong audience. Reported by media, A-mei confessed that she had never felt such great pressure at a concert before, when fans begged her not to be disturbed by the raucous protesters.</p>
<p>Undeterred by negativity, A-mei proceeded to work on her new album, "Maybe Tomorrow" (也許明天) which was released on September 21, 2004. A-mei composed two songs, namely, "Love is the Only Thing" (愛是唯一) and "Critical Moment" (關鍵時刻) on the album. Although the album was chosen as one of the "Top 10 Local Album Releases for 2004" by the <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taipei_Times_6b51.html" title="Taipei Times">Taipei Times</a>, the change in music style and direction drifted away from the common acceptance level of mass <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandopop.html" title="Mandopop">Mandarin pop</a> music listeners and therefore, failed to perform on charts.</p>
<p>Later that year, A-mei accepted the Taiwan Tourism Bureau's invitation for the role of <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tourism_in_the_Republic_of_China_8b9d.html" title="Tourism in the Republic of China">tourism</a> ambassador. Three versions of television commercials were filmed, targeting audiences from <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_6282.html" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore.html" title="Singapore">Singapore</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaysia.html" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a> respectively. Alongside, she sang and produced the pop-rock and aboriginal fusion theme song titled, "<a href="../../../n/a/r/Naruwan.html" title="Naruwan">Naruwan</a>." In collaboration with the TV hosts from the three places, A-mei co-hosted a short series of travelogues titled, "Tour Taiwan With A-mei" to share the island's wonders with people outside Taiwan. Above all, she toured the three places, making appearances for some face-to-face sharing sessions with her fans and supporters.</p>
<p>As part of the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_c3f4.html" title="2004 Indian Ocean earthquake">Tsunami</a> <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humanitarian_response_to_the_2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_5a2b.html" title="Humanitarian response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake">relief effort</a>, A-mei participated in fundraising concerts in both <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwan.html" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_6282.html" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>. In addition, together with other celebrities, she sang the specially written song titled, "Love" (愛), a Mandarin version of "<a href="../../../w/e/_/We_Are_the_World_ef64.html" title="We Are the World">We Are the World</a>".</p>
<p>In December, she accepted the invitation from MTVasia and put up an exclusive showcase, "MTV Live With A-mei", held at <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_Theatre_and_Concert_Hall_1372.html" title="Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall">Victoria Theater</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore.html" title="Singapore">Singapore</a>. Together with the band made up mainly of <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_of_Singapore_625e.html" title="Music of Singapore">Singaporean musicians</a> from "Sonic Sanctuary," they delivered a well-received concert.</p>

<p>In 2005, A-mei decided to take a short break from her frantic lifestyle. She headed to <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston.html" title="Boston">Boston</a>, <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_f75d.html" title="USA">USA</a> for a three-month language course in January. Not a mere getaway, it was intended as a journey of self-discovery.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discovery_Channel_ee82.html" title="Discovery Channel">Discovery Channel</a> and GIO collaborated project called "Portraits Taiwan" (台灣人物誌) that spotlights <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwanese_people.html" title="Taiwanese people">Taiwanese</a> icons in different fields, selected A-mei as the representative of the "Mass Culture and Entertainment" category. These six documentaries were broadcasted across <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a> to tell the stories of outstanding Taiwanese. In addition, A-mei was nominated for the "16th Taiwan Golden Melody Awards" in both the "Best Female Vocalist of the Year" category and the "Best <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_Video_8dcf.html" title="Music Video">Music Video</a>" category with the album track, "Love Is the Only Thing" (愛是唯一) with her album, "Maybe Tomorrow."</p>
<p>A-mei took up the task as the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Vision_c5bc.html" title="World Vision">World Vision</a> Taiwan (WVT) ambassador and headed to southern <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudan.html" title="Sudan">Sudan</a> with the charitable organization in June/July. On the press conference to launch the <a href="../../../3/0/_/30_Hour_Famine_ffe0.html" title="30 Hour Famine">30 Hour Famine</a> campaign, A-mei shared her encounters and experience during her visit. "There is a water shortage almost everywhere in <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudan.html" title="Sudan">Sudan</a>, and people don't really have a choice. I met an 11-year-old girl named Mary, who is so clever, and speaks English fluently. She told me that she can't go to school every day because it is too far away, and the school is so primitive. She wants to leave there and go to a place where she can study," she said. In the same month, A-mei visited an aboriginal village in southern <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwan.html" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a> - the home to people of the <a href="../../../p/a/i/Paiwan_people.html" title="Paiwan people">Paiwan tribe</a>. Along with Biung Wang (Taiwanese singer) and volunteers, they sent flood relief and moral support in hopes to alleviate the area, which was badly destroyed by a recent flood.</p>

<p>In November, A-mei was invited to perform on the "<a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Horse_Film_Festival_and_Awards_0e0e.html" title="Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards">Golden Horse Awards</a> 2005." With her band, composed of musicians from "DOMS," she performed a medley of 13 classic movie theme songs from the past century. It regarded by many to be an incredible, awe-inspiring showcase. <a name="2006-Present:_New_Challenges:_Singing_and_Beyond"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/-/m/A-mei.html" title="Edit section: 2006-Present: New Challenges: Singing and Beyond">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">2006-Present: New Challenges: Singing and Beyond</span></h3>
<p>In February, A-mei released her new chart-topping album, "I Want Happiness?" (我要快樂?), one many see as her come-back piece. Unlike her previous albums, during the production of this release, A-mei had only one music producer, Eric Chen, and a lyrics supervisor, Yu-Kang Wu (a.k.a. York Wu, 鄔裕康) and herself. One of the tracks, "Extrication" (海闊天空) was made the theme song for "Fishing Luck" (等待飛魚), a <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwan.html" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>-produced film.</p>
<p>A-mei continued to take on the duty as the island's tourism ambassador for the third consecutive year since 2004 and sang the theme song titled, "Touch Your Heart". The media reported that she has assisted <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwan.html" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a> in achieving outstanding tourism results by promoting the island's numerous tourist attractions to travelers from the region for the past two years.</p>
<p>In June, A-mei was invited to perform at 17th Golden Melody Awards(金曲獎). The showcase - Music Orz - was a fusion of world music and pop music, that includes Taiwan Aboriginal music, African djembe, Afro-Brazilian Capoeira, Indian <a href="../../../s/i/t/Sitar.html" title="Sitar">sitar</a> and Hip-hop.</p>
<p>In preparation for her upcoming musical debut, "愛上卡門" to be staged in December 2006, she headed for <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>, <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_f75d.html" title="USA">USA</a> for an intensive theatrical training conducted by experienced Broadway instructors and performers.</p>
<p>Promptly after her return from the States, she was back in studio for the recording of a new song titled, "Princess Bannen" (巴冷公主), a duet with Biung Wang. The melody was written against "Princess Bannen," a myth of the Rukai Tribe composed by Biung Wang. Enchanted by this beautiful melody, A-mei invited her friend and musical partner, Yu-Kang Wu to pen the lyrics. The song is recorded in Biung Wang's album, "War Dance" (戰舞).</p>
<p>A-mei was honoured with the Diva Division ("MTV Legendary Diva") title at the MTV Mandarin Awards in September.</p>
