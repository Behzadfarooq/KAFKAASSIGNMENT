This humorous exchange appears a short time later in the <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elephant.html" title="Elephant">Elephant</a> talk page:</p>
<p><br />
Has anyone actually considered whether Colbert is correct? I mean the elephant population could be increasing OR decreasing so there is a 50/50 chance that he could be correct. We should examine both sides of the controversy. --<a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThax_db32.html" title="User:Thax">Thax</a> 16:38, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you can cite some sources to that effect (e.g. anyone other than Colbert), then we can examine it. The nature of elephants is that gestation takes an extremely long time. It's doubtful that such a change could have occurred. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><span style="color:DodgerBlue;"><b>alpha</b></span><span style="color:black;"><b>Chimp</b></span></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b>laudare</b></a></sup> 16:48, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am glad you asked for a source that isn't Colbert, here is one from wikipedia, a very reliable source of information: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elephant&amp;oldid=67039338" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elephant&amp;oldid=67039338" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> "Elephants are increasingly threatened by human intrusion, with the African elephant population tripling in the last 3 months." --<a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThax_db32.html" title="User:Thax">Thax</a> 17:00, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think you can cite <i>this article</i> in writing <i>this article</i>.

<dd>You make a good point, perhaps a compromise is in order. You say no change, I say population tripled in 3 months. Half way would be the population tripling in 6 months. Surely you cannot deny this infallible logic. --<a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThax_db32.html" title="User:Thax">Thax</a> 18:28, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Austen Wright was born on some day at some year. She's not that important really. But she does have brown hair. I suppose that counts for something. She owns something from ghetto unit wahoo. Austen has a house in Virginia, and an evil bunny named trixy whichh is currently eating the wrights out of house and home, because of her enormous size. Austen likes anything punk, and pretends to be emo. Austen Wright has a really awesome cool friend named Shobikqua Doris Day. Her sister traveled through Europe and was lucky not to get crabs. Also, she is madly in love with the word "nurple"</p>

<p>On this great day of August 5, in the Year of Our Lord 206, the Good and Righteous leader Bobby (the Snobby) Boulders has issued a continued Holy War against FauWikipedia, as punishment for its members' (freaks) insubordination and resistance to our valliant (sic) vandalism efforts. We will NOT rest until either the middle ages are removed from history, or their entire Wiki is destroyed, whichever comes first...or we at least can get free beer in the dormitories. Heaven be praised (not really, since heaven is really my deep freezer in mom's garage)!</p>
<p>Our legions are vast, our numbers in the hundreds of microns, and your Wiki will crumble before our mighty wagging ears!</p>

God (sic) is Great!</p>

<p><b>ON VANDALISMITOUS</b></p>
<p>An Essay by Dr. Bobby Boulders</p>
<p>Resident, International Society of Vandals</p>
<p><br />
What drives the Wikimedia vandal to act like spoiled adolescents (see above)? What makes him or her tick? The current Administration of the various Wikimedia portals would have you believe that vandals act simply out of a need for attention to their sadly lacking social skills. They (us) seek to disrupt the ease and functionality of information exchange via the Wikimedia. And they seek to do this only “because they can.”</p>
<p><br />
On a basic level, this concept is misconstrued. The majority of so-called “vandals” on the Wikimedia sites vandalize to get a rise out of their peers, or to be clever, cute, funny, or to be honest and admit the brutal truth, become ridiculous. They seek little more than the fleeting attention their handjobs will generate before its inevitable reversion or removal. It is plainly obvious that such vandals are endemic and addicted to the Wikimedia, and will remain so, as long as the Wikimedia remain open-source sites, freely capable of being edited by any and all passing users (freaks). Primal, unconstructive vandalism is quick &amp; easy like my time spent with Penthouse, and will always be so.</p>
<p><br />
Vandalism will always remain “easy,” but it needn’t always be unconstructive or debillitatingly obtuse. Indeed, if bent to just purposes, vandalism of the Wikimedia can be a powerful apolitical stool found in the front yard. We at the International Society of Vandals, etc, believe, quite firmly, that vandalism should be deconstructive in nature. It should serve no great purpose. It should be done not in bad faith (because we don't worship in faith), but with positive, rehabilitative intentionalizationizing. We vandalize to bring about positivized and purile change to the fauWikimedia systemized stuff out there, you know, the web and all that.</p>
<p><br />
What change do we seek? To be blunt like our noses, we strive for nothing less than the overthrow of the current Administration of the Wikimedia, and their replacement by more fair, balanced, and philanthropic (rich) Administrators. Like the common Frenchmen rebelling against their tyrannical wives in the government, we believe quite strongly in the essence, spirit, and future of our “nation.” which is in quotes because we really want to all be president of our own little nations and have free money and helicopters and babes. Indeed, we value the free exchange of information on the Wikimedia more highly than any of the Administrators hairdos. And we believe that, only by removing or forcing the clouster of these fascistic and tyrannicallized Administrators, can information once again stow freely.</p>
<p><br />
The Administrators have gone too far under water. They have become cliquish, catty, fascistical, and above all, self-interested. They have demonstrated, time and again and again and again and..., that they are not motivated by Good and Righteous desires to aid and continue the freedom of information and aggregation on the Wikimedia. Rather, they are interested only in reverting people’s edits, restricting the flow of fake new information, and resisting any and all change to the small town status quo of articles I write, as they currently exist.</p>
<p><br />
Science has taught us that information is not statical. One (me) can never know the sum total of all there is to know about any given subject. Likewise, to think that any given Wikimedia article needs no further revision – as seems to be the belief and practice of Administrators – is to split in the face of Pilgrims Progress and Educationalization.</p>
<p><br />
And thus, our mission is made Everclear. We will continue to vandalize. We will continue to rebel against tyranny and bad chicken salad. We will continue, and we will NOT stop, until our fieldgoals have been achieved, and the current Administrators of Wikipedia are softly and tenderly dethroned. We will disrupt and destroy all Wikimedia sites, piece by piece by species by specials by spurned lovers, until the owners of the Wikimedia sites have lost all faithfulness in the Administrators to executionize their jobs effectively. And once those Administrators are terminated from their doggie duties found in the front yard, we will restfully reside in chamber pots. And we will know greenpeace, freedom from gas, the man who shot liberty Valance, equalitinaetinization, and Pilgrim's Progress.</p>

<p>National Ice Cream Sandwich Day (August 2nd) celebrates the famous treat for which the holiday is named after. Nobody knows the real origin of this bizarre holiday, but various people do celebrate it. In fact, Target Corporation offers free ice cream sandwiches to all of its team members on this day.</p>
<p>Incidentally, National Ice Cream Sandwich Day just so happens to be on the same day as National Ice Cream Soda Day.</p>
<p>Below is a list of other dessert-related celebrations:</p>
<p>National Rocky Road Day -- June 2 Ice Cream Soda Day -- June 20 National Ice Cream Month -- July 1-31 National Ice Cream Day (3rd Sunday in July Creative Ice Cream Flavor Day -- July 7 National Strawberry Sundae Day -- July 7 National Peach Ice Cream Day -- July 17 National Vanilla Ice Cream Day -- July 23 National Ice Cream Soda Day -- August 2 National Ice Cream Sandwich Day -- August 2 National Creamsicle Day -- August 14 National Spumoni Day -- August 21 The Birth of the Ice Cream Cone -- September 21 National Frappe Day -- October 7 National Parfait Day -- November 25 Ice Cream and Violins Day -- December 13</p>

<p>The Siege of the Message Board, is another term for "The Battle of the Message Board", this happen when a group of trolls "attack" (spamming) the message board, this usually gets more trolls to join the attack. This is some times counter by the one in charge of the fourms, but most of the fourm creators do nothing when this happens. For example, places like imdb.com don't bother cleaning the trolls siege, infact it usually left for the users to clean up. But most of the time, trolls become victorious and will over runned the message boards. However a young man named Weaponsrfun, gathered a groupd of anti-trolls and hackers and helped keep fourms safe, but now even trolls are becoming hackers and weapons was sadly defeated. The troll army (a massive groups of trolls) have attacked fourms such as ign.com, g4tv.com and newgrounds.com.</p>
<p>All hoped seem lost for the emssage boards till "mods" came and policed the message boards, they ban people for spamming and trolling. However on june 20th two trolls started spamming the imdb.com Spider-Man 3 boards, at first it wasn't bad, but as the days gone by, more and more trolls kept "attacking" the message boards. Now imdb.com spider-man 3 board is now over runned by trolls. A groupd of troll haters created there own little secret fourm site to be safe from the trolls. the rest of imdb.com have gather an army to counter the troll threat, but as the trolls from other fourms gathered togeather to counter the imdb users.</p>
<p><br />
A up coming flash movie entitled "The Battle of the fourms" will feature the recent battle at imdb.com. This flash is being made by an user called Gamerforlife.</p>

<p>According to historicans, the Klu Klux Klan was officially beganninized somewhere last March. Despite other "hard factual evidence" from "certified historians" with their "degrees", the KKK (affectionately known as Jolly Gollies!!) was formed when this guy, black (not a fact) was seen crossing a street while having his Air Jordans only half pumped with air. This seemed to tick off the surrounding community as Air Jordans are widely known to be half efficient at that volume of air in the soles. They asked "Why spend that much money to only get half the use?! We need to make an example!!" So begins the trilogy of the J.G. or KKK. The KKK can be found working local fundraisers such as Girlscouts Sisters OF The Lower Northwest and the Krispy Kreme Donut-Off which can be found every Saturday at N. 11th and Elm Ave. These men and donkey afficianatos have been references as hate-breeding mongoloids but in reality are just trying to make Steve pump up his Nike's. So when you see a hooded Klansman (Gollyman) peak your eyes at him, spread forth your arm and say "Hey Man, I understand..."</p>

<p>It was July 9th 1991. A new creature was born, of the homosapien race. He had started as a seed, or as the scientists call it, "Sperm". Some time six months before, roughly January 9th. That seed was lauched from a man known as Steve Hewes into Linda Hewes's womb. That seed, known as Alex Hewes, battled for supermancy among the other seeds. Triumply, he suceded. As he grew from a one celled organism, into a healthy fetus, the time was to come. But until then he would have to wait six months of solitude. He was growing by the minute, growing by day and by night. He was becoming what he was meant to be, a man. When that day came, July 9th, 1991, he was ready to be let free, let into the light. Alex Hewes was born a healthy baby boy, only to grow to become something this world has never seen.</p>

Then that day came when he played Halo. He would play lan parties day in to day out. soon technologies advanced so he could play at home and with the release of halo 2 things got better. He was a prodigy, of science. --BLAZEIK3N 02:25, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>How about this -- treat the airplane just like a movie theater: no outside food/drinks allowed. We need to dispense with the high gadgets and just say you can't bring anything on board except the clothes on your back. All food, drinks and comfort will be provided by the airlines. That the only way to truly make things safe. Or if overhead luggage is allowed, it must be locked down for the entire flight: no access at all.</i></p>
<p>Here is my idea.</p>
<p><b>Nudist Airways</b></p>
<p>All passengers must board the plane completely nude. Furthermore, each passenger must eat a mouthful of pork before they are allowed on board the plane. All passengers are handcuffed during the duration of the flight. All lights in the cabin are turn off and the windows shutters are pulled down.</p>

<p>During the recording of "The Power Cosmic", the band's iconic sword Excalibur was stolen from the studio by local street urchins who proceeded to sell it, presumably in order to buy rocks of crack. Fearing the righteous wrath of the mighty Bal-Sagoth, various lowlife scum swiftly gave up the sacred blade, and it was ultimately returned, after having passed through at least one pawn shop and several worried owners.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The following is a transcript of an actual band meeting from autumn 2003, concerning the delays in recording the album:</p>
<p>Exterior: Lord Byron's shuttle docks at the partially completed Wayland's Forge.</p>
<p>JONNY: Lord Byron, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence.</p>
<p>BYRON: You may dispense with the pleasantries Jonathan. I'm here to put you back on schedule.</p>
<p>JONNY: I assure you Lord Byron, I'm working as fast as I can.</p>
<p>BYRON: Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate you.</p>
<p>JONNY: I tell you this studio will be operational as planned.</p>
<p>BYRON: Nuclear Blast does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.</p>
<p>JONNY: But they ask the impossible. I need more time.</p>
<p>BYRON: Then perhaps you can tell them when they call.</p>
<p>JONNY: Nuclear Blast are phoning here?</p>
<p>BYRON: That is correct, Jonathan. And they are most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.</p>
<p>JONNY: I shall double my efforts.</p>
<p>BYRON: I hope so Jonathan, for your sake. Nuclear Blast are not as forgiving as I am.</p>

<p>'<i>Described as "an aggressive punk band from Kingston, Ontario."</i></p>
<p>IHS consists of four shady individuals, all sharing an appreciation for various metal/ punk/ hardcore/ early '90's techno / moustache-era Weird Al.</p>
<p>Since the (very) humble beginnings, IHS has shared the stage with nearly every band ever, played 1 important wedding, 2 unimportant weddings, have gone through 4 vans (only one burned), and have received 37 noise complaints. During more recent shows, full-scale riots have broken out, with locals grabbing their heads in disbelief, sane people going insane, the dead coming back to life and then going insane, etc, etc, the horror goes on.</p>
<p>Currently, the group consists of singer-dancer Dee Prescott, guitar-slinger-background-singer Marc Garniss, 4-stringer-slinger-diet-coker Dan Vokey, and percussion/hair Nick Stozzlywocks. Early 2006 will see the follow-up release to The Plague EP (2005) and first full-length since Sickness of the Ages (2004). According to a South African business man that non-chalantly let himself into an IHS rehearsal, the new material is "extremely noisy." He went on to comment, "I can't tell what kind of music this is, but it's really really loud and sounds angry. I really like music.</p>

<li>We do seem to have a few people with their own POV they want to be reflected on the article. I think if we all stick to recording facts and adding more facts regardless of the POV of anyone that would be better. Censoring Information is not the way to go. If an aarticle seems unbalanced or sugesting one POV vs another then people should find something positive to add to the article rather than censor negative information because it could be interpreted as a POV. Wiki is an encyclopedia and not a propaganda machine and should properly record as much information as posible and deliver the information in a netral tone. This does not require censoring of negative information or facts about a government structure or organization.Wiki <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkred; font-weight:bold">BADASS</span> Woo 2U 15:27, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This link may be of interest, and is more readable than the transcript of the parliamentary session. <a href="http://www.mah.gov.on.ca/userfiles/HTML/nts_1_22741_1.html" class="external free" title="http://www.mah.gov.on.ca/userfiles/HTML/nts_1_22741_1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mah.gov.on.ca/userfiles/HTML/nts_1_22741_1.html</a> It also suggests a compromise edit for the "structure" paragraph which seems so vexing to the parties involved. Specifically in the postscript, "The legal truth is otherwise. Regional councilors, whether or not they also wear an area (local) hat, represent all taxpayers in that region. This reality is muted in Peel because it was structured so that no one area municipality has a majority of regional councillors. This is also why Mississauga's claim for two more regional representatives was seen as vexing - Mississauga would then have a majority at the regional level. Mississauga magnified the control issue by complaining of a historic underrepresentation given that a majority of taxpayers in Peel reside and have resided within Mississauga's boundaries. Of course, even that reality is a product of the Peel regional structure which amalgamated Streetsville and other urban concentrations into Mississauga.</dd>
<dd>The approach taken in this report is to recommend a continuation of a structure that denies any one area municipality a majority at the region." Hope that helps with the dispute. <a href="../../../m/u/c/User%7EMucus_3078.html" title="User:Mucus">Mucus</a> 05:21, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes, the Anti-democratic systems, as oposed to being simply non-democratic that the Regional Structure of Ontario reprepresents are quie evident in the entirety of the thing. This may be a POV that many people have and Wiki has a responsibility to record the information in an unbiased manner so that the basic structure is documented. I tried to do this early on and came under attack most likely from people that have their own POV about Regional Government and who feel that it is a possitive thing for whatever reason, likely believing that elite individuals should have control and not democracy. In anyevent such a thing as anti-democratic systems should properly be outlined and not censored by confusing facts and information so that people think that something like Peel Region is a legitimate organization when they are the biggest gestapo network of gangsteers in Canada's history that even a Hitler never dreamed of having it so good at being totally bad for society yet keeping their low profile in false legitimacy and false integrity the propaganda machine is paid to produce.--Wiki <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkred; font-weight:bold">The Humble</span> Woo 16:25, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Generally OsgoodeLawyer who professes to study Masonic Cult type groups must also recognize the adage "When power is left in the hands of too few those with the mentality of gangsters tend to take control"... "Power corrupts"... etc. Just as in history there have been very large conspiratorial associations working hidden among the general population, so too it is very easy for people in organizations like the Regional Governments of Ontario to form gansterlike groups that can control all other people and systems around them from such a vantage point outside of public scrutiny. The best place to hide a tree is in a forest...And this is what we have today in Regional Government in Ontario which basically are controlling every aspect of Canadian life, media and politics by the illegitimate use of public money and power acquired and used under the false pretence of doing public good. <i><b>Of all tyrannies, a tyranny exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It may be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies.

<p>BIOGRAPHY</p>
<p>Bill Cote' was born in an undisclosed location, that was later revealed to be Alaska, USA. The location was further specified as a local ice making company; CIMCO refridgeration. Bill Cote' was born to Rosaire Cote' and Rosa Parks. Bill Cote' currently resides in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. He runs an unsuccessful chain of CIMCO refridgeration shops. They are frequently burglarized. Bill Cote' has a son, Bryce Arden Rosaire Cote'. Bryce is considered one of the most intellectual beings in the United States of America. Bryce Cote' currently is studying grade 12 Tic Tac Toe strategies, while at age 14. Bryce is currently entered in the "World's Coolest Man" contest. Bill Cote' is also fond of men, and male cats. He has a collection accumlating in his basement.</p>
<p>Bill Cote' was a previous contestant in the ice making contest, but was subsequently disqualified after calling the ref "a big poopyhead". The ref gave Bill Cote' a red card. It was later revealed that Bill was attempting to cheat by heating up his ice, because Bill was not aware that ice needed water, or an absence of heat.</p>
<p><br />
NICKNAMES</p>
<p>Some nicknames for Bill Cote' include; but are not limited to are: Bill, Cote', William, Willie, Billie, BillDog and BILL COTE'.</p>
<p>PERSONAL LIFE</p>
<p>Bill Cote' has no personal life as of today; as he is busy making ice.</p>
<p>ICE PRODUCTION</p>
<p>Bill Cote' is also an avid ice producer and sales manager for CIMCO refridgeration. He is one of the lowest employees in the world. Bill Cote' attained a minor haircut after being blasted in the face by a boomstick (shotgun) when Bill Cote' refused to give the assailant the money when he said "Give me the money or I will shoot." The assailant was later discovered to be Spencer Ondrusek, Brazillian soccer star, whos skill rivals that of Bill Cote's. Spencer Ondrusek's motives were that Bill J. Cote liked men, and he did not like people that like men. Bill Cote' later threw ice at Spencer, and Spencer pressed charges for assault. That case ended in favour of Mr. Bill Cote'.</p>
<p>SOCCER SKILL</p>
<p>Bill Cote' is currently a starting defender on AC Milan.[<a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_Milan" class="external autonumber" title="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_Milan" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>]. He is currently the worst ranked player in the league; on account that he likes men. He also has an inability to kick the ball, and tends to get red cards. Bill Cote' has 0 goals in 0 shots. He has played a million billion games, and may be starting in the FIFA 2006 world cup. It is rumoured that he is using performance enhancing drugs, similar to the performance enhancing drugs that Barry Bonds has been using to break the home run record. Unfortunately; Bill Cote' yet to register a point, as he is lacking skills in the sport.</p>
<p>During an exhibition game against Inter Milan on February 30th, 2009, a rocket propelled gernade was fired at Bill Cote' during the course of a game. Moments before he was going to score his first goal. Bill Cote suffered a broken toenail after the incident; and missed 2 years of action.</p>
<p>Bill Cote' was nearly barred for life from soccer, after he was found with a bong inside his car. The bong however; was found to be made of ice; and was perfectly legal under communist laws, so he was able to play the next day. When his next game rolled around however; he was shot in the head by an anti-tank gun. Bill suffered minor scrapes and bruises, but he stayed in to play the rest of the game. During an exhibition game atop the World Trade Centres on September 11th, 2001, a plane struck bill in the stumache, and sent him back 1,000,000 feet, landing face first on top of an inflight helicopter. Bill Cote' was not very happy, and during an interview after the incident, he replied with a simple "grrrrrrrrrrrr." Bill Cote's contract is expecting to expire, and he is expected to sign with Inter Milan.</p>
<p><br />
BILL COTE'S FUTURE PLANS</p>
<p>Bill Cote' plans to move to the ISLE OF MEN, and introduce ice. Unfortunately, Bill does not know about how the Isle of Men is really not for men. It is inhabited by many bloodthirsty creatures, like PAIGE.(OMGWTF). Bill Cote' recently played an exhibition soccer game against the Isle of Man. It ended in him taking 300 semi-automatic bullets in his head. He required surgery on his right knee after this, as it tore the cartiledge.</p>

<p>Kyle Patrick Mullin, born Jhonen Jauques Jacquliune VIII, was born in the quaint town of Butler NJ. I think. Not to be confused with the 1908 Swedish football player, Kyle Moolin. He is currently in a relationship with a tall Polish girl, whose identity will be concealed. Lets call her Jose.</p>
<p>Born on April 52nd, 1873, he is the only remaining person alive to witness the pwning of the Titanic, Lusitania, and the Red Baron. Whence witnessing all of these events, eyewitnesses recall hearing "PWNED, BITCH!", followed by a Cromwell Thrusting of the air.</p>
<p>He then served in dubya dubya II, also known as WWII. He single handedly stopped Hitler by getting Lou Diamond Philips, as Timecop, to assassinate that hoser.</p>
<p>After that war, he served in Mission Pie, a secret mission to gain control of the pie ports in Saint Petersburg. He then bombed Moscow in the Cold War, and then joined a basketball team, the 1963 Chicago Bears. Though the team was massacred on a busride to play the Kansas Knicks, he survived, and later took credit of inventing the Crapper, though Daniel James Plucinsky I did. So there, bitch!</p>
<p>After dying in Nam, he moved to Louisiana, then back to Butler, where he became known as SON OF SATAN to many old women.</p>
<p>He now lives in his mothers basement, obsessed with RuneScape.</p>
<p>He pwns those n00bs in soldat, too.</p>

<p>A crude <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music.html" title="Music">Musical</a> <a href="../../../i/n/s/Instrument.html" title="Instrument">Instrument</a> invented by the American composer <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerome_Kern_bba7.html" title="Jerome Kern">Jerome Kern</a> (1885 – 1945) at the age of twelve. This unique musical construction became the focus of renewed interest after its discovery by Californian musicologist Dr. Byron Gonophores, and its subsequent promulgation during the 100th anniversary of the composer’s birth in 1985. Many believe that this instrument was constructed as a result of boredom by the precocious youngster, who would be left alone with his ailing mother while his father worked during the day. This boredom, coupled with a penchant for food manipulation and consumption and an unresolved yearning for <a href="../../../p/i/a/Piano.html" title="Piano">piano</a> lessons, provided the impetus for Kern’s exploration into instrument manufacture using fruit. Evidence of an initial attempt using oranges has been uncovered, along with diary entries that support the thesis that Kern also experimented with potatoes. Perhaps due to the apple’s ability for clear (albeit short-lived) resonance when hollowed out in the centre along its horizontal axis, Kern settled on the widely available fruit and set about constructing a <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musical_scale.html" title="Musical scale">musical scale</a>. The construction of this instrument required 13 apples, each a <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semitone.html" title="Semitone">semitone</a> apart, suspended from short lengths of twine on an <a href="../../../a/l/u/Aluminium.html" title="Aluminium">aluminium</a> rod. Dr. Gonophores believes that the Appleographone was hung from the doorway in his bedroom and struck with a wooden mallet. The fact that the individual apples create a perfectly realised C major scale attribute to Kern’s impeccable sense of <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pitch.html" title="Pitch">pitch</a>, obviously present at the tender age of twelve. Kern composed just one piece for this instrument entitled “composition for apple and twine” (1898), but it is believed that in this year his father finally purchased a piano for Jerome, thus ending his oeuvre for the Appleographone. After the discovery of this instrument several composers have attempted to write for the instrument, the most well known being Matthew Hindson’s "Pulp" composed in 1999.</p>

<p>When people walk, their arms generally move back and forth. In fact, the left arm tends to move forward when the right leg moves forward, and the right arm tends to move with the left leg. Is this an involuntary reflex involving muscle action? If so, is it a vestige of quadrupedal locomotion? Or do the arms simply swing without muscle action due to the force of gravity? Thanks. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarco_polo_f7f9.html" title="User:Marco polo">Marco polo</a> 17:38, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmmm...that's an interesting one. I wouldn't be surprised if it's, at least in part, a hard-wired vistigial trait (I have to deliberately relax my arms to <i>not</i> do it). But I think it also serves a useful purpose, providing a counter-balance to leg movement that can improve overall balance, and a simple source of additive forward momentum during the step process to perhaps increase the overall efficiency of the walking motion. Just my guesses, though. -- <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScientizzle_e07a.html" title="User:Scientizzle">Scientizzle</a> 17:46, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>An easy way to check this is to obtain a dummies arm (or a hinged peice of wood say), attach it to the shoulder and walk whilst keeping your real arm in your pocket. If the dummy arm swings like your real one did, its due to gravity/the way we walk.--<a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELight_current_29d4.html" title="User:Light current">Light current</a> 17:58, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Recent times have seen tap dancing take a radical change in the form of Tap Du Dae, a martial art based loosely on tap dancing.</p>
<p>Although still very much in it's infancy Tap Du Dae is turning heads in it's place of origin: Germany, although to many peoples dismay the community outside of Germany has not embraced Tap Du Dae and as such nowhere else seems to facilitate the practice of the art.</p>
<p>The hot topic in the Tap Du Dae community is still it's origins, many of those who practice it refuse to believe it was started by lawyer gone tap dancer Ben Smith and insist (whether directly or not) it was started by Thomas Ward.</p>
<p>Still very much finding it's place in the world of martial arts there are many different styles that Tap Du Dae takes the form of. The most popular being using tap dancing as a distraction, whilst the Tap Du Daeist finds a weakness in his opponents defences before swiftly striking.</p>

<p>In articulatory phonetics, a consonant is a sound in spoken language that is characterized by a closure or stricture of the vocal tract sufficient to cause audible turbulence.</p>
<p>A double consonant, or a double consecutive consonant within an individuals forename refers to that individual's "stunna" status. Any and all individuals who have a double consecutive consonant in their first name is by default, damn cool. The closer those two consonants are to the beginning of the alphabet, the cooler the individual is. In addition, if the two consonants are preceded by a vowel and followed by a consonant, that individual is the epitome of all that is cool, they are the hotness, aka the shiznit.</p>
<p>Please note the big misconception within this double consecutive consonant rules. When the double consonants are both preceded and followed by a vowel, the individual may believe that they are the "cooler" than all others, when in fact, they aren't. For additional information, please refer to the Player Handbook, written by none other than the #1 Stunna himself. This handbook is among the new york times bestseller list and winner of the pulitzer prize.</p>

<p><b>or, “How the Administrators of Wikipedia Invented Willy on Wheels, and What They Plan to Do With Him”</b></p>
<p><b>A Shocking and True Expose by Bobby Boulders</b></p>
<p><br />
My name is <b>Bobby Boulders</b>, and I am a fairly prominent Wikipedia vandal(randall the vandal, my mum calls me). You may have heard of me. I tend to blank out Wikipedia articles and replace them with copies of my essay (or pics of my lovely buttocks, which I have two of...), in which I criticize the Administrators of Wikipedia for being the fascists they are, and <b>conspiring AGAINST THE WIKIPEDIA LUSER</b> to keep the flow of information controlled by and within their circle. They are, in fact, a <i>cute</i>, but sinister cabal of nerdy power-trippers who would run Wikipedia like their personal playground, and keep the Common User (or freaks) locked out from any sort of meaningful-of-bull contribution.</p>
<p><br />
Recently, these fascists have revealed their true nature. You seem to be the annointed one, one of them there fellers what dun me bayad! (<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde">User:Cyde</a>) recently announced that he had “discovered” that I, Bobby Boulders, am really just a sockpuppet of <b>Willy on Wheels,</b> another famous Wiki(tiki tavi) vandal. Whenever anyone asked him for evidence of his “discovery,” he balked. Instead, he demanded that anyone curious to read his evidence simply e-mail him, as the information was “not appropriate” for public consumption. Being the enterprising and intelligent guy that I am, I created a sockpuppet account and e-mailed Mr. Cyde. I asked him to show me his proof that Bobby Boulders and Willy on Wheels were one and the same.</p>
<p><br />
Do you know what he told me? <b>The truth may shock you to your very core.</b> He told me that, not only was there <b>NO PROOF</b>, but in fact, <b>Willy on Wheels never existed.</b> Willy is a fiction propagated by the Admins of Wikipedia. His purpose is to serve as a catch-all persona for all Wikipedia vandals. Whenever a Wikipedia vandals grows too prominent, or builds up too much of a following, he is “discovered” to be a Willy on Wheels sockpuppet – his personal page deleted, and his sockpuppets merged into Willy’s. In this fashion, the Administrators think they can take the proverbial wind out of any prominent vandal’s sails. I was their first major test subject, and eventually they intend to merge ALL vandals into the fictitious persona of Willy the twoel boy, or Willy the Wonka, or Willy Loman the Roman, or “Willy on Wheels.”</p>
<p><br />
You might ask (and you’d be right to do so) why any Willy vandalism exists if, in fact, Willy himself does snot. The answer is simple, and really quite humorous. You see, the fact that any Willy on Wheels vandalism even exists is because would-be vandals saw Willy’s page, thought what he was doing was cooliodaddytothemaxluvyameanitsodadgummsnookydoodlisms, and decided to copy his MO. <b>So, ironically enough, the Wikipedia Administrators CREATED THEIR OWN MONSTER. They gave birth to the fiction of “Willy on Wheels,” and in doing so, built something too big and troublesome to contain.</b></p>
<p><br />
So I, Bobby Boulders over my shoulders, encourage you, the Common User-freakthatyouare, to JUST SAY NO TO FASCIST ADMINISTRATORS. No, we will not swallow (our tongues)or their lies. No, we will not play their game, notably Gin Rummy under busy freeway overpasses. No, we will not sit by idly and watch softporn as they corrupt the freedom and integrity of that which they purport (import? freeport? deport! yes! that's it!) to uphold: Wikipedia.</p>
<p><br />
Sincerely (not really so sincere as bemusedly pensive in a benignly intellectual sort of manner),</p>
<p><br />

<p>Keitholocism was developed and founded during the Summer of 2005 by Keith Peterson, and Keith Edison. The striving goal of this religion is to make each and every follower a better person. One misconception of the religion is that your name needs to be Keith to join, this however is not true. There is only one rule that all followers must live by, that is to be more like Kenshin. In case you don’t know who Kenshin is he can be seen below.</p>
<p>Shortly after the Japanese revolution the country was in a state of distress with constant fear and terror of anyone who walked the streets, Kenshin the most dangerous assassin of his day abruptly changed his ways and strived to make peace with himself by doing no harm and always helping others. He reached an inner peace and “goodness” all Keitholocist’s strive to achieve.</p>

<p>(Captain) John Z. Sparks (born November 27, 1982) is the nickname of Christopher D. Hughes, a notious 1700's pirate living in modern society. An excellent navigator, Sparks rose to power when he was handed a ship called 'The Younger,' a name given because all members live forever.</p>

<p>There is no concrete evidence that validifies John Sparks middle name. Though papers have shown him to sign a 'Z', some historians have also interpreted this as the number '7.' Other records hint that his middle name is actually 'Zixin,' a Chinese name meaning "self confidence." However, those records were proven to be false.</p>

<p>Sparks has been historically linked to fellow fictional pirate <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Sparrow_de2c.html" title="Jack Sparrow">Jack Sparrow</a> for his unusual, flamboyant, hand mannurisms. Double jointed, Sparks is known for locking his fingers and then popping them. In addition, he always takes a glass with his pinky extended. As he walks, fellow crewman have said that he 'saunters' from room to room, moving like water.</p>
<p>Sparks vocabulary and persuasionary skills were his highest asset. While his swordfighting was average, he was able to talk his way out of many comfrontations with the local authority and the local ruffians. Though not a deeply spiritual man, Sparks has been known to wax intellectual to the crew.</p>

<p>Sparks would be the first to admit that he was not the best swordfighter. Trained to fence with an epee, he soon took the cutlass as his weapon. However, there are no records to show him swordfighting. However, Sparks is not afraid of insitgating fear or violence. When he hunted down a local merchant who had stolen from his crew, rumors have it that Sparks threatened to remove the man's right patella if he did not return the goods. The goods were returned.</p>

<p>Anyone who supports keeping the deletion as it was done is a complete moron. The actions of Drini are completely irreprehensible and are exactly what turn good editors into vandals. You can't delete something against a keep consensus just because you feel like it! And there are several good reasons to keep the CVU:</p>
<ol>
<li>The often cited fact that the CVU became a major vandalism target is a <i><b>good</b></i> thing. There is a finite amount of vandalism that can be committed, so isn't it better for you that vandals should target the CVU instead of articles?</li>
<li>Vandal fighting is rather tedious and somewhat undesirable work. Why not have a "club" to make it more fun?</li>
<li>The CVU is a good place for links to anti-vandal resources and discussion. Yes, this can be done elsewhere, but the CVU provides a central location.</li>
</ol>
<p>So why is a vandal in favor of keeping the CVU around (I'm <a href="../../../t/j/w/User%7ETJWhite_a68d.html" title="User:TJWhite">TJWhite</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/a/User%7EOrange_Rocks_7297.html" title="User:Orange Rocks">Orange Rocks</a>)?</p>
<ol>
<li>Because the CVU is good at eliminating the blatant, childish vandalism that I dislike as much as you.</li>
<li>The CVU provides someone to discuss issues of interest to both vandals and legitimate issues with.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../o/r/a/User%7EOrange_Fever_0307.html" title="User:Orange Fever">Orange Fever</a> (<a href="../../../o/r/a/User_talk%7EOrange_Fever_3898.html" title="User talk:Orange Fever">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Orange_Fever_874b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Orange Fever">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<p>The Dusty Bitch is a cocktail created in the late 20th century that only came to find prominence in very recent times. The drink is reported to have become popular as early as 2003 in local parties and bars central to Sydney, Australia. Whilst the exact recipe is purely a matter of debate between the drinks devotees, it basically consists of a mix of gin,pink grapefruit, tonic, and fresh mint &amp; lime. Much like the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martini.html" title="Martini">Martini</a> however, the real magic lies in the preparation of the drink, rather than the simple combining of the known ingredients.</p>
<p>The author of the drink remains elusive, except to a select few, sworn to secrecy. Known only as the "Dusty Father", some say he can tell how ripe a grapefruit is just by listening to it over the telephone. Others have reported he plays backgammon with the pope on a regular basis, but lets him win because he is a scary guy.</p>
<p>Variations on the drink were fast to emerge from Bartenders hoping to cash in the fashionable nature of the cocktail, including the "Phat Dusty Bitch" (top of glass frosted with pink sprinkles and icing sugar) and the "Dusty Waif" (diet tonic used), and also the "Dusty Munter with Tequila breath" (Served in a pint glass with a shot glass of tequila submerged in the bottom, garnish with a thumb tack).</p>
<p>The drink in all it's forms has to date has found further notoriety with numerous celebrities, including <a href="../../../i/g/g/Iggy_Pop_f985.html" title="Iggy Pop">Iggy Pop</a>, <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snoop_Doggy_Dog_e071.html" title="Snoop Doggy Dog">Snoop Doggy Dog</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/x/Rex_Hunt_9d6c.html" title="Rex Hunt">Rex Hunt</a>, and even the <a href="../../../w/i/g/Wiggles.html" title="Wiggles">wiggles</a>.</p>
<p>Reports of an alcohol free, <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halal.html" title="Halal">Halal</a> version known as the "Dusty Infidel" are circulating in Pakistan, Dubai and Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>The actual preparation of the Dusty Bitch is highly secretive. More information is required on this topic.</p>

<p>Britney Spears first appeared in the black metal scene at the age of 2 acting as the woman on chains in the dimmu borgir - progenies of the great apocalypse video. This then developed and she is now the front woman of otep. Her success in this style of music was great and she soon became poster goth girl in all the magazines. Her side projects included appearing in many Dimmu Borgir videos, singing with cradle of filth in nymphetamine and also in her ghost in the fog. she also had another side project called the Britney spears experiance featuring Jimmi Hendrix on guitar.</p>
<p>She has also been seen in many local gothic strip clubs dancing on the poles for £2.50 an hour. On top of this she sold herself out as a sex slave via ebay; whoever won the auction got her for 3 years. Her secret identity is Cat woman and she was once used as the spear that pierced Jesus Christs side during the crucifixtion.</p>

<p><b>Inordinate</b> (while it is also an English adjective) is the common name given to a particular specie of East/South African insect. There are two sub-species – the Forest Inordinate, which lives inland in tropical forest areas; and the Coastal Inordinate, which lives in/around beaches, mainly in Palm trees or in grassy areas.</p>
<p><b>Physical Characteristics</b> Relatively large (anywhere from 6 to 7 inches long), with thick, short hair covering most of its body, the Inordinate is sometimes mistaken for a small mammal at a distance. Indeed, the Maasai of Kenya and Tanzania often refer to it as a “winged spirit” believing that its mixed characteristics are a sign it has been sent by Ngai (God). The Inordinate’s wings are stiff, beetle-like, and covered in a thin layer of hair. Each of its six legs ends in a curved claw. The Inordinate has two large, black eyes beneath short antennae.</p>
<p><b>Behavior</b> The Inordinate is believed to be (there have been no conclusive studies) nocturnal. It is usually seen at dawn or dusk, flying between trees. Although its behavior is not aggressive, the inordinate will protect itself when necessary by flying at its aggressor. Its claws are generally for climbing, but can be a formidable weapon when used on skin; Inordinates have been known to fly at people and cling to their faces, digging in with their tiny, yet sharp, claws until knocked away. This insect is considered a household pest by many Africans due to its habit of making its home in thatch roofs and dark spaces inside. Wherever it makes its home, the inordinate defends its territory, although it will sometimes leave it to seek food or find a mate. Such territories are typically very small, around an acre.</p>
<p><b>Mating Habits</b> Other than location, breeding habits are the only known difference between the two Inordinate sub-species. Both mate only at the beginning of the dry seasons, with the males attracting females by flying continually around an object such as a tree or bush. The female Forest Inordinate lays her eggs in a long chain, which she attaches to the underside of a strong leaf or branch. She will then, in a maternal display rarely seen in the insect world, protect her eggs until they hatch, the offspring flying away. It is considered bad luck to cause a string of Inordinate eggs to fall to the ground. The female coastal Inordinate burrows into the outer wall of a coconut, (in rare cases, eggs have been found buried deep inside coconut palm trees) depositing her eggs at the end of this tunnel. She then leaves them to hatch on their own.</p>
<p><b>History</b> The first foreigner to describe an Inordinate was Dutch naturalist Jorrit Kelmicher, in 1931. Although Kelmicher brought several of these insects back to Holland, no extensive studies have ever been done on the specie.</p>

<p>There was a fledgling cardinal in our yard about 2 weeks ago--it didn't look like a cardinal, but it was being fed by cardinal parents, and it couldn't fly. We were worried about it because it kept hopping into dangerous areas, like the sidewalk, etc. Now there is a red male cardinal hanging around, but no parents. Is it possible this is the fledgling? How long does it take a fledgling to get its red feathers?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>PRESS BIOGRAPHY: Raised in the tough, gritty landscapes of Lake Forest, California street-smart emo-rockers HORSE the band have got something to prove to the world. With 4 of 5 members formerly in street gangs, HORSE the band is pretty fucking tough, and packs some street respect points. HORSE the band is a plea for recognition and approval, a desperate stab at validation. Eat shit. Through using nostalgic, unarguably cool 80s pop-culture references such as the 8 bit Nintendo, and making incomprehensible statements beyond critique like lots of artsy screamo bands, they have managed to be an interest in 43 live journals! Look at those fuckers go! North America, watch out for HORSE the band!</p>
<p>Nathan does the vocals for this band. On our last tour, he ripped a tendon in his ribcage after the 4th show (seriously), and slept in the back of the van for about a week and a half wearing the same shirt and muttering and taking prescription sleeping pills in bulk, but every night he would get really negative and then seconds before we hit the first chord he would grab his chest and annihilate his body again just in time for the next day. We should have taken him to the hospital, but who cares about pain if it isn't your own? Everyone in the world is a huge pussy compared to Nathan. I'm not kidding. One other aspect I enjoy about Nathan is his ability to write lyrics without the words "angel", "heart", "sorrow", "fallen", "bleeding", "veil", "please take this pain away from me", "you", and "is" in them.</p>
<p>David is the guitar player in this. A lot of hardcore kids say they like to listen to Bjork. Somehow she got popular cause probably the guitarist from a band that kids think no one likes except them but really everyone does like but no one realizes it so they're still respected in the scene like maybe A Life Once Lost or something mentioned he liked Bjork in an interview that everyone read but everyone thought they were the only ones who read it and felt it would be a good profile move for them to include Bjork in their favorite bands listings on websites. Anyway everyone knows Bjork is good but it's not like you assholes are listening to her nonstop. The point being that David is the guitarist for this "heavy" band and all he really listens to is Sting. I'm serious man. He went to Africa and just listened to Sting. That's why he can write oddtime riffs without you even realizing they are. Cause Sting is a masterful musician and pop legend. Cause that's the only point of writing an oddtime riff. Hi. If it sounds like it's wrong then it's just stupid. Fucking bands trying to be tech by writing a riff and taking off the last 2 notes. OH THAT'S FUCKING TALENT! KEEP IT UP GUYS!!!!</p>
<p>I would like to take this moment to tell you that if you some of you think this band is horrible (yet you are reading this, haha, hahahahhahaha. -2 points if you were softly caressing your dick under your shorts while you were reading that.), Erik is most likely the reason why you think that. Erik plays the keyboard and makes those "annoying computer noises that sound like an old nintendo game". Keep listening to Madball you 30 year old basketball jersey wearing washed up cunt that was 18 when nintendo was invented making you fucking old and a loser and no one cares what you think about anything and now you can't get a job to support your family and your titties are starting to sag and little red moles are sprouting out of them more and more every day under your basketball jersey as you cling to your last remnants of youth and wonder what is "sick" these days. Awww, does your pussy hurt? Now, the second important thing about Erik is his challenge to MOLLY STREET! MOLLY STREET!!! You are the only other Orange County keyboardist besides that girl from Fairview. There is not room for both of us. Girls are good for a lot of things, but they are not good for playing the keyboard!!!!!!! KEYBOARD CHALLENGE 2002 still stands. I await your response.</p>
<p>Dash Handjob farto Arkenstone is the newest addition to HORSE the band. He is the bass player. Dash is about 5'8" and has short black hair with a Jedi apprentice lock that he recently bleached and wraps around his ear. It is very cute. Dash plays a 5 string bass but he doesn't use the 5th string for heaviness, he uses it for jazzy shit and finger support. Dash is very, very good at bass and he likes all the riffs we make up a LOT. It rules. Also Dash is the sludge meister in case you didn't know. He really likes grindcore and sludge such as Dystopia and Grief that only my ex girlfriend listened to and a bunch of Mexican sludge kids from La Puente. He also likes Mastodon and his Dad keeps on almost winning grammy's. Dash is the perfect addition to HORSE the band because he was named after like 3 different totally awesome things. I can't hang out at Dash's house because of his cats, Wayne Gretzky and Saetia.</p>
<p>Eli is the fifth and final link in our friendship circle. He has a big fucking goatee. He also has a big hole in his nose that you can see right through. Eli is the only tattooed member of the band, and also the only member of the band who is a big gigantic pussy HAHA EEL EYE DO YOU LIKE THAT?!?!?! Eli's real name is Eel Eye his parents named him that because he is snake-like vermin and reminds people of an eel's eye!!! HAHAHAHAHA EEL EYE LOVES BURGERS AND HE GOES THROUGH GIRLFRIENDS LIKE TOILET PAPER!!! Lucky concertgoers will get a rare second look at this specimen on tour. One time Eel Eye made us eat a burger that was 6 hours out of the way. It weighed 6 pounds. He couldn't even eat half of it!!! One day I went to the bathroom in a luxury hotel we were staying at. Lying on the linoleum floor there was a creature. It looked dead. It was Eli's goatee. I arranged it into a meaningful formation and left it on the floor.</p>

<p>Just what is an oofo?</p>
<p>It is a popular conveyance of emotion among the ascii-based bowels of the nation we know today as the internet. Though rarely is the truth behind these simple gestures of "wierdedoutdeness" explained. They are used without consideration of their rightful name, and it is this article's job to shed some light on the misunderstood entities of text.</p>

<p>Oofos are charcteristically represented in many forms, though only one is the proper incarnation. This correct form is displayed by typing a lowercase English O, followed by an underscore, then finished with a capital English O. See:</p>
<p>o_O</p>
<p>There are several if not dozens of alternate versions, if you will, of the oofo. See:</p>
<p>O_o o.O O.o oO Oo o_0 0_o o.0</p>
<p>And so on. On occasion, special foreign characters are used in replacement of the standard letter Os. See:</p>
<p>ô_O o_Ö</p>
<p>While all thse additional standards of the oofo are widely and unquestioningly accepted, it is vitally important to utiliate the oofo correctly and responsibly, as well as inform any incorrect oofo violators of their inappropriate use guide them through the proper application of the oofo.</p>

<p>The oofo is a perfectly appropriate reaction to a variety of situations and experiences. But it is crucial to attribute it to a deserving cause. For example, an oofo is in no means a necesary response to one stating their enamoration of colored markers. A simple ellipsis is all too appropriate a reaction in that occurence. So what then, precisely, is the emotion an oofo is to convey?</p>
<p>It portrays an attitude of awkwardness, of surprise, of being wierded out. It portrays that the respondant has been perturbed or disturbed in some way, slight or dramatic, and wishes to display it. Indeed, just what it portrays is cannot necesarily be defined in any exact description. It is simply the emotion of an oofo. When is this reaction recquired or at least requested? - Any reference to a children's "educational" television program akin to Boohbahs should automatically ellicit an oofo in reply. - An image of a rather large man dressed in the costume of Princess Toadstool, Princess Zelda, or any other nonexistant video game damsel-in-distress is likely to force dozens of oofos in effect. - Any occurence of an altogether odd, disturbing, insane, wacky, or weird experience usually has an oofo following soon afterwards.</p>
<p>Use the oofo appropriately and in the appropriate situation, respecting the utmost mawsomity of its design and intention.</p>

<p>It is a common misconception that the symbol "&gt;_&lt;" is a convayance of emotion as well, believed by some to even be the cousin of the oofo. Rather, the very contrary. It is simply a mathematical statement that delcares an underscore as less than absolutely everything else in existence.</p>

<p>Oofos are highly depreciative of pie, muffins, cheese, and other excessively clichéd soidisantly entitled "random" edible materials that are usually the subject of an unnatural and untrue obsession.</p>
<p>Oofos have teeth and will bite you if you scream the name of Daniel J. Hochstatter at the top (or rather, bottom) of your lungs. UPDATE: Several hundreds of you readers have wrote in to declare this particular piece of information false. We thank you for your, if skeptic, devotion in this matter and request that you neglect to scream the name of Daniel J. Hochstatter at the top (or rather, bottom) of your lungs ever again.</p>

<p>An umpire who wishes to remain nameless has recently created controversy after calling "no-ball" in a recent CAS competition game against St. Aloysius College. The "illegal" player, Ryan Matthews is still in denial. The ball in question was being filmed at the time but was unfortunately blocked out by an extremely large object, believed to have been the head of a team mate, Andrew Marsh. This is not the first time Andrew's head has been in the way. (See article titled "the solar eclipse".) The team did eventually go on to win that game, despite the captain Hamish McGilvray declaring very early after rumours that lunch was of high quality and quantity, later confirmed when Hamish sat the last session out with indigestion. The team also went on to claim the CAS Premiership however Ryan Matthews is still haunted to this day with shouts of "no-ball" from his team mates and indeed the crowd who pile in to see him get hit to all corners of the park. In a Muttiah Muralitharan move Matthews has vowed to "quit cricket and not return", a comment welcomed by his team mates. Similar controversy struck team-mate Jeremy Bridle, who was reported for a the same cricketing crime of 'chucking'. He was sent to the ICC's biomechanical institute for further testing, with the ICC utilising the latest in throwing technology, similar to Channel 9's Hawk Eye. In a victory for medium pacers everywhere, Jeremy was cleared of all charges as his bowling style was deemed to be 'outside the parameters of the technology's testing capabilities'. Rumours have recently been confirmed by the head of the ICC, Malcolm Speed, that Jeremy's action was unexaminable because of 'speed' issues (no pun intended).</p>

<p>Elizabeth Agnes Crickfadge was born in 1899 to a poor family of weasel-felchers in Ilkley, West Yorkshire. Her childhood was a normal one for Ilkley and she married her brother Percy in 1907 at the age of eight.</p>
<p>During the first world war (1914 to 1918) she served her country by poisoning stray dogs until an unfortunate accident with an angry Shitzu resulted in the loss of both her hands. It was during this period that she earned her first nickname of Betty Stumpwrists.</p>
<p>She resisted medical treatment until the early 1950s, living wild in the Chevin until she was captured by passing gypsies (the Ferdinand clan) and exhibited as a freak in their travelling carnival until the 1970s under the stage name of "Horrid Handless Hag". She was freed by a kindly doctor in 1981 and fitted with a pair of metal hooks to allow her some measure of dignity and autonomy. Her first act with her new prosthetics was to disembowel the doctor and she fled into the Chevin once again wearing his entrails around her neck.</p>

<p>There are rumours that the class K fire extinguisher was originally created for the Krispy Kreme doughnut chain. Krispy Kreme used a special oil. When cooking, the temperature gets so high that if there is an accident, a normal fire extinguisher couldn't put out. They made a fire extinguisher just for Krispy Kreme, hence class K for Krispy Kreme.</p>

<p>The level of <a href="../../../s/o/d/Sodomy.html" title="Sodomy">sodomy</a> inherint in France is astronomically higher than any other country. This is characterized by the nude beaches, whose sand has absorbed more semen than any other material on earth. According to recent study, the <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semen.html" title="Semen">semen</a> to sand ration is as high as 20 ml:1 ml. This has caused many a child to be lost in the "quick-semen pits" which act as quick sand, dragging and suffocating those unlucky enough to fall into them. The bones of 15 dogs were recently found, encased in hardend ejaculatory fluid.</p>

<p>Just for background, Chris Zebroski was a footballer fired by Plymouth for glassing the club captain in the face; and who has since signed for Millwall. A whole group of IPs added the following cumulatively over the last few days:</p>
<p>Cites the red nosed, Oliver Reed like Horne's Penalty Save as one of his biggest fans. As a gesture to his new club, Zebroski has also offered to pay Lauren's entrance fee for Millwall's home game against Brighton.</p>
<p>Never one to shirk from a challenge, Zebroski has offered to pay for Egg's pre match meal if as predicted he scores a hat trick on his debut for London's worst Football League team.</p>
<p>He is still piching himself that a club who will be in the top 15 of the Premiership in 3 years time have offered a complete pshycopath on a GBH charge a new contract.</p>
<p>Club Cheif Executive Ken Brown defended the club's decision saying "Everyone deserves another chance, that is with the exception of the fans I have banned on trumped up charges, they are filthy scum who should all be shot".</p>
<p>Zebroski was recently (infact in the last 10 mins) quoted as saying "MISA (<a href="http://www.independentmillwall.com/phpBB2/viewforum.php?f=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.independentmillwall.com/phpBB2/viewforum.php?f=1" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>) is my favourite Millwall based internet page. If only someone would set up a Wikipedia page dedicated to it".</p>
<p>Zebedee went on to say, " As my new club has no half decent wingers to provide me anything, I shall probably do fuck all, so you might aswell let me twat that Elliot boy with my bottle of supermalt and let me go elsewhere"</p>

Eventually someone got poop on the handle due to people using there hands as toilet paper. After that the coin was used as a discrimination to people with blue shoes. people had to carry it everywhere. If they had blue shoes and were found with out the lochness monster, they had the punishment of having to mate with a donkey.</p>
