<p>I subscribe to the magazine, as as far as i know they do refer to themselves as "AdBusters" and not as "Adbusters".

<p>I have a copy of the Nov/Dec 2005 issue (#62 vol 13 no 6). Other than the title on the cover (which is all caps), the contact box on the last page states the publication name as "Adbusters (ISSN 0847-9047)". DerwinMcGeary</p>

<p>The current picture with the "UnBrand America" poster should be changed to one of their magazine issue's front cover. Why? It seems like posting the image of their advocacy poster seems like Wikipedia is promoting their cause according to my perception. I think it is just best to use a magazine cover such as <a href="http://www.sugarart.ca/adbusters.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sugarart.ca/adbusters.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> to keep sort of NPOV. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_Cow_1aaa.html" title="User:Anonymous Cow">Anonymous Cow</a> 06:42, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would disagree with that, since this article is no longer about magazine alone, but also about the Media foundation. Having a picture of a magazine would in itself be POV since that would create an implication that everything involving AdBusters is simply a wrapper around their periodical. But i would settle for a black dot or something like that. <a href="http://eng.anarchopedia.org/index.php/User:beta_m" class="external text" title="http://eng.anarchopedia.org/index.php/User:beta_m" rel="nofollow">Beta_M</a> <a href="http://eng.anarchopedia.org/index.php/User_talk:beta_m" class="external text" title="http://eng.anarchopedia.org/index.php/User_talk:beta_m" rel="nofollow"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Beta_m_affc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Beta m">|<sup><b>contrib</b></sup></a> (<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Beta_m_520d.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Beta m"><small>Ë-Mail</small></a>)</dd>

<dd>I disagree with the black dot, since it should go on the black spot article instead. As to the image being POV, well AdBuster's has a POV that should be expressed in the article. I felt the unbrand America image protrayed that most clearly. A magazine cover does not do that as well. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 06:05, 16 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Does anybody else find it odd how this supposedly anti-consumerist organization tries to sell you something at every turn? Perhaps this should be incorporated in the wiki page?</p>
<p>No. I don't really find it odd at all. I don't think about it. More than anything, I'm bored by your re-hashing of a very old, very worn, conservative-boilerplate critique of anyone who sells anything and yet also has the temerity to critique the system. How frigging creative of you. Did you work on this criticism up all on your own or did you secretly have help from mom and dad?</p>
<p>_Easy now. I thought it was a good point, even if you disagree, no need to freak out.</p>

<p>It doesn't say some critics say, it says some would argue, some would say..etc. Theres no need to change it, because theres nothing that suggest some acclaimed critic has said this. It's just providing a point of view. it makes clear that its a point of view.

<dd>Notable or not, we need to know who the critics are. We especially don't want construction like "some would argue". If they do argue it, then we can include it. Part of the reason that we like to know the names of critics is to make sure that they exist, and that the criticisms are just the opinions of editors. Another reason is that then we can make sure the criticism is correctly summarized.

<p>I think the criticism section as it stands cannot be seen as NPOV. I'm not sure how to make my argument, but I know that siting Adbusters Pro-Palestinean stance feels like the author is suggesting being pro-Israel as the morally correct stance. I feel like the criticism section should be reserved for examples of an organization/person doing something unjust, not what controversial stances has an organization/person taken on two sided issues.

<dd>OK. I've removed it outright. I'd encourage any editor who knows of specific criticisms to write an NPOV, sourced section which summarizes actual criticism. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 17:13, September 6, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Maybe luddism isnt the right word. They are against alot of technologies, alot of which are new.

<p>somewhere i read that all pictures on adbusters.org where fair use, but i just ran into [<a href="http://adbusters.org/network/reprint.php" class="external text" title="http://adbusters.org/network/reprint.php" rel="nofollow">this</a>] page, are we safe using the two pictures we have? i added a picture of a traffic ticket adbusters uses, but i bet theres WAY better pictures for culture jamming. <a href="../../../s/p/e/User%7ESpencerk_f3c4.html" title="User:Spencerk">Spencerk</a> 20:58, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry about the slow response; that came from me and I attached it to <a href="../../../a/d/b/Image%7EAdbusters_NY_Billboard.jpg_65e8.html" title="Image:Adbusters NY Billboard.jpg">this</a> image description; as I received an e-mail saying that from the photography editor of the publication. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 06:27, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Adbusters has responded to the criticism by <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rebel_Sell_79df.html" title="The Rebel Sell">The Rebel Sell</a> in an issue sometime, and it would be great to get their response on here and the rebel sell page. Ive been looking like crazy for this article and can't find it. Its in the back where they review books sometimes, its a half-page... Can anyone else find it? <a href="../../../s/p/e/User%7ESpencerk_f3c4.html" title="User:Spencerk">Spencerk</a> 23:36, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article previously said that AdBusters just denoted as Jewish those with Jewish-sounding names -- which insinuated a sloppy anti-Semitic research. There was no supporting reference for this claim. I just did a quick search on the individuals denoted by AB as being Jewish and it all holds up -- most of them have their own wikipedia articles that mention this. If one counter example can be found -- either one erroneously listed as being of the Jewish faith when they are not or one listed as not being Jewish but actually is -- please come forth. Until then, I have removed the insinuation of sloppy anti-Semitic-motived research. --70.48.240.111 17:55, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>i agree, i think the criticism should be made that the use or relavence of the article is contreversal, not that the article is inaccurate. good work <a href="../../../s/p/e/User%7ESpencerk_f3c4.html" title="User:Spencerk">Spencerk</a> 19:08, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The article currently states: "It is, however, unlikely that they will be successful, as both the Canadian and American Constitutions only restrict the government from infringing upon freedom of speech, not private individuals and groups." However, it also lists CBC as a defendant. The CBC is a crown corporation.--<a href="../../../s/v/e/User%7ESven_Erixon_9e57.html" title="User:Sven Erixon">Sven Erixon</a> 00:48, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm afraid I'm going to have to request/make an NPOV on this page. It reads more like a manifesto/mandate for the organization than an encylopedia article.<a href="../../../2/0/9/User%7E209.169.114.213.html" title="User:209.169.114.213">209.169.114.213</a> 04:39, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
