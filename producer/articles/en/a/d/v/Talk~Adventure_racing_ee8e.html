	    <p>I've added a section on AR race directing. It's from a document I started a while back and sent out to various folks for comment. Definitely a work in progress and may not jibe with every RDs MO; however, the point is to create a pseudo-standard for putting together a race instruction booklet or passport. I would love to see a checklist of sorts for putting on a race as well. Comments are appreciated.Jim Farmer 01:06, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Is this on VFD? I couldn't find it?<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Richards_3ae7.html" title="User:Mark Richards">Mark Richards</a> 01:06, 7 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm curious why it's up for deletion. There wasn't an entry for 'adventure racing', so I added one. No worries if it doesn't fit the criteria here, but I'd like to know why so I can avoid this later.</p>

<dd>I couldn't find a mention of it on VFD - unless it is there, the notice should be removed. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Richards_3ae7.html" title="User:Mark Richards">Mark Richards</a> 01:06, 7 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

I do believe that discussion on the cause of Nigel's death does not belong in this article. (Safety section). Single mention is sufficient.</p>
<p>I believe the brief descriptions of the types of injuries and accidents helps provide an understanding of the type of risks involved in AR. It also highlights an important issue in AR -- the balancing of adventure/self-reliance vs. safety.</p>
<p>Hello, do you know why the references to the impacts that adventure racing has on the environment and the ARFE group were removed? Adventure racing gets very very close to the environment and I believe it's quite important that there is a discussion that gets started--or addressed--on its actual impacts, and what those of us who are in race management and racers ourselves can do about it...ARFE 14:41, 27 August 2006 (UTC)ARFE</p>
<p>&gt;Response. I agree with your point and reinserted a section on the environmental impact of AR. (btw, I didn't delete the initial paragraph). I suspect it was deleted as it read a bit like an ad for your group as opposed to an informative discussion. I would encourage you to expand the section with additional facual information re. the environmental impact of AR, as without it, I suspect the person who deleted you addition may again delete the section.</p>
<p>&gt;Response. Hi John, Do you think you can contact me off-list? Our group would like to work with you on crafting some sort of data on racing and how it does affect the environment and what resources are available for people interested in that sort of thing--in the meantime, thanks very much for addressing the issue. Write to me at yishun (at) arfe (dot) org. Thanks--ARFE 22:01, 16 September 2006 (UTC)ARFE</p>

<p>I made a couple changes to the page and I'll explain them here since there seems to be an effort to revert to original style. This isn't a magazine article so flashy quotes at the beginning of each section are very out of place. If you'd like to make a List of adventure racing quotes article, feel free, but they probably don't belong on this page, or at the very least, at the beginning of sections.</p>
<p>Also I remved the links to team pages. It's like putting on the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball.html" title="Baseball">Baseball</a> article a selective of list of whatever teams editors choose to add. Not only will/would it become unbearably long, but it also doesn't belong on this page. Feel free to create individual articles for the teams or a List of adventure racing teams article, but an expansive article probably doesn't belong here. <a href="../../../j/a/r/User%7EJarfingle_2eaa.html" title="User:Jarfingle">Jarfingle</a> 20:53, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Instead of a "bulk revert", please make your case for re-inserting deleted text. Also, when deleting significant portions of an article, it is always helpful to state the case for doing so, as has been done here (apparently after the fact).</p>
<p>For my part, I agree with most of the removals. The new text regarding the environmental impact of AR did not add significant factual information. As suggested above, I agree it is an important topic (and one I had spent considerable time trying to craft without much success while writing the initial article that formed the roots of the current AR article). It should, however, include some type of significant factual information on the impact of races...such as the impact in past races, challenges in course design, etc.</p>
<p>The list of AR teams did risk a becoming a meaningless laundry list of teams, and is likely not fully consistent with the overall goals of Wikipedia. (I suspect a stand alone article of AR teams would soon draw fire as being meaningless and self-serving). I do recognize, however, that a list of team websites did contribute value, and for adventure racers was a resource to find other racers, as well as examples of how to design one's own site. To help fill this role, I will post a link to a list of adventure racing teams. I hope this will reduce any friction re the deletion.</p>
<p>Regarding deletion of various quotes, I personally enjoyed the quotes (I added the one from Dan Barger, so I freely confess my bias). I also believe "flashy quotes" are appropriate, and creating a page dedicated to adventure racing quotes, would not be a meaningful exercise without proper context. Nonetheless, I also think articles should evolve and when meaningful edits are made, I set a high standard prior to reverting.</p>

<dd>Hi John,</dd>
<dd>Thanks, good point, I'll try to hit up the talk page beforehand in the future. Thanks for the thoughtful and effective resolution of listing adventure racing teams. Also, regarding the quotes, perhaps imbedding them in the article/sections might be a solution? I just took objection to them heading each section because it struck me as more promotional literature-esque (don't get me wrong, the quotes are great, but that's almost the problem!) or magaziney. Being someone who has just started to get the piles of college advertising junk in the mail, I simply may be oversensitive to this!</dd>

<p>I'd like to see a section here devoted to adventure racing clubs. A large part of keeping this sport alive is the work being done by groups (mostly volunteer and non-profit) to introduce newcomers, and as a newcomer a way to find them would be very valuable. I'd argue more valuable even than linking to teams. I have a vested interest in this because I started and help run GMARA, but as a true non-profit our only goal is helping the community. I know there are many such clubs just in the Northeast - how about we get a listing here?</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>
