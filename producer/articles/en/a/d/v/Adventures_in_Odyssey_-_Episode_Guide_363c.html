<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/v/Adventures_in_Odyssey_-_Episode_Guide_363c.html" title="Edit section: Family Portraits - 1987">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Family Portraits - 1987</span></h2>
<p>In the mid 80's, <a href="../../../f/o/c/Focus_on_the_Family_c475.html" title="Focus on the Family">Focus on the Family</a> had an hour long broadcast hosted by <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._James_Dobson_ace7.html" title="Dr. James Dobson">Dr. James Dobson</a>. Around 1987, Dr. James Dobson instructed his director of creative development to come up with a different form of media to rech out to families and their children. The directive inspired several dramatic shorts that were broadcast in late 1986 and culminated in a 13 part drama series that aired on the hour long broadcast.</p>
<p>This album is not well known as part of the Odyssey cannon as it was never widely distributed. However, many of the foundational facts of Odyssey were laid out in this 13 part series that dealt with Whit's family and the layout of Odyssey. In this album Odyssey was described as a "mythical town in Ohio" though later on in the series this fact was never reaffirmed. This album is something of a collector's piece as it was never repackaged and re-sold. It was released as a 4 cassette package with the introductions and follow-ups by Dr. James Dobson and co-host Mike Trout.</p>
<p>Many of the actors that were anchors and regulars on the series made their debut here as other characters. Among them were <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katie_Leigh_e091.html" title="Katie Leigh">Katie Leigh</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Walker_2162.html" title="Paul Walker">Paul Walker</a>, <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_Boen_a6c0.html" title="Earl Boen">Earl Boen</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walker_Edmiston_91aa.html" title="Walker Edmiston">Walker Edmiston</a>, and Nathan Carlson.</p>

Whit also talks to the audience during the opening of this episode. It presents information about the founding of Odyssey and Whit's End, but some of it conflicts with information some information given in Recollections.

Tom and Whit pick him up at the station and try to break the ice by getting hom to sign up with the Odyssey Coyotes Little League which Tom coaches. Monty has a hard time adjusting to life with his grandfather due to the fact that he didn't have much discipline at home.</p>
<p>Everything came to a head one night when Monty tricked Jimmy, one of Whit's employees, to let him into the register so he could go to the movies. The scene immediately switched to Whit checking up on Monty who is recovering from his first spanking ever from Whit. After a good coversation and a heart to heart with his grandson, the two created a bond that was the changing of Monty.</p>
<p>Several weeks later, Jana showed up at Whit's End during a celebration for Monty's little league team because Monty had secretly called her and asked her to come and "get him out of there." Monty did not want to leave and told her that Whit loved him more and we are witness to an argument between Jana and Whit that would set the stage for their tension for later episodes.</p>
<p>In the end, when Jana comes for Monty the next day, he attempts to run away and is picked up by the police. The event shows how much Monty is willing to speak out. Whit &amp; Jana agree to try to make it work between them as Whit confesses he unintentionally neglected Jana because of Jerry's death after which he spent so much time with Jason. It also reveals that one of the reasons the Whitaker's moved to Odyssey to get as far as away from the war as possible.</p>
<p><i>Fact Points</i>: This is the first episode in which we hear Whit get angry.</p>
<p>We also are introduced to Whit's daughter and grandson in this episode. His other two sons are discussed as well. Jerry, the oldest, died during Vietnam and Jason is still alive but not featured in this episode.</p>

<p>This was the 1st 12-episode collection from Focus on the Family that featured the full length broadcasts dedicated to Odyssey USA. The first few episodes suffered from technical limitations including obvious background noise loops and unpolished mixing and effects.</p>

<p><i>Theme</i>: The importance of failure</p>
<p><i>Characters</i>:Davey Holcomb, Whit, Tom Riley, Ralph, Amanda <i>Plot</i>: The episode opens with the Odyssey Coyotes winning their game and Davey Holcomb is up to bat. Ralph and Amanda are not to enthused about Davey's chances for carrying them to victory but Coach Riley tell them to have confidence. Still, the Coyotes lose and they end up at Whit's End.</p>
<p>Whit takes note of Davey's somber mood and shows him his "flop" invention that never worked. Davey breaks a lever off and runs out of the shop. Whit followed him out and conivinced him to fix the machine and in the process discovered that it was supposed to be a copy machine. Instead, Davey turns it into a working Pizza oven and earns the respect of his team mates.</p>
<p><i>Facts</i>: Since this was the first episode the gang took a look around Whit's End, introducing the Train Set, the Inventor's Corner, the Workshop, and the displays.</p>
<p>GOOF ALERT: Whit says that Davey knocking over the backstop was a coincidence. It's clear from later episodes (such as 47: A Single Vote and others) that Whit does not believe in coincidences.</p>
