<p><b>Advergaming</b> is the practice of using <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_game.html" title="Video game">video games</a> to advertise a product, organization or viewpoint. The term "advergames" was coined in <a href="../../../w/i/r/Wired_%28magazine%29.html" title="Wired (magazine)"><i>Wired</i></a>'s "Jargon Watch" column in 2001, and has been applied to various free online games commissioned by major companies.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/v/Advergaming.html" title="Edit section: Categories">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Categories</span></h2>
<p>Advergaming normally falls into one of three categories:</p>
<p>1) At first a company provides interactive games on its <a href="../../../w/e/b/Website.html" title="Website">website</a> in the hope that potential customers will be drawn to the game and spend more time on the website, or simply become more product aware. The games themselves usually feature the company's products prominently. These games are often reworked arcade classics but occasional gems can be found such as the <a href="http://www.dyson.co.uk/game/info.asp?sinavtype=menu" class="external text" title="http://www.dyson.co.uk/game/info.asp?sinavtype=menu" rel="nofollow">Dyson game</a>, <a href="http://www.intel.co.uk/itgame" class="external text" title="http://www.intel.co.uk/itgame" rel="nofollow">Intel's IT manager Game</a>, the <a href="http://www.clearahill.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.clearahill.com/" rel="nofollow">a classic from Nurofen</a> or the recent 3D real-time advergame developed for <a href="http://www.toyota-auris.fr/" class="external text" title="http://www.toyota-auris.fr/" rel="nofollow">Toyota</a></p>
<p>The earliest custom video games featuring integrated brand messages (now called advergames) and were distributed on <a href="../../../f/l/o/Floppy_disk.html" title="Floppy disk">Floppy disk</a> in the era before substantial penetration of the World Wide Web. The first floppy disk advergames were developed to serve dual purposes — as promotional incentives that drive response and as media that deliver awareness. American Home Foods <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chef_Boyardee_0196.html" title="Chef Boyardee">Chef Boyardee</a> brand issued the first-ever floppy-disk advergame<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. Other early brands to use the format were <a href="../../../c/o/c/Coca-Cola_916a.html" title="Coca-Cola">Coca-Cola</a> and <a href="../../../t/a/c/Taco_Bell_fcda.html" title="Taco Bell">Taco Bell</a>, which distributed games as ""kids premiums". The first in-box CD-ROM cereal box advergames were Chex brand's <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chex_Quest_eae4.html" title="Chex Quest">Chex Quest</a> and General Mills All-Star baseball, which starred Trix Rabbit and friends playing baseball against Major League teams and stars.</p>
<p>2) In the second form, games are published in the usual way and cause players to investigate further. The subjects may be commercial, political or educational. Examples of the second form of game include <i><a href="../../../a/m/e/America%27s_Army_60f6.html" title="America's Army">America's Army</a></i>, intended to boost recruitment for the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_9bfc.html" title="United States Army">United States Army</a>, and <i><a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_Force_2317.html" title="Special Force">Special Force</a></i>, intended to promote <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a> resistance to the state of <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>. Two soft drink mascots also appeared in their own game. <a href="../../../p/e/p/Pepsiman.html" title="Pepsiman">Pepsiman</a> appeared in a game of the same title. The most recent of this form of advertising was the use of the King mascot from hamburger chain <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burger_King_5522.html" title="Burger King">Burger King</a>, starring in three video games titled the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Games_8f40.html" title="King Games">King Games</a> series. <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cool_Spot_97c8.html" title="Cool Spot">Cool Spot</a> was the mascot for <a href="../../../7/_/u/7_Up_6db3.html" title="7 Up">7 Up</a> and appeared in a game of the same name. Games themed for a specific sporting organization such as <a href="../../../n/f/l/NFL_18f8.html" title="NFL">NFL</a> or <a href="../../../f/o/r/Formula_One_17d2.html" title="Formula One">Formula One</a> racing can also fall into this category.</p>
<p>An example of educational advergaming is <a href="../../../f/o/o/Food_Force_4858.html" title="Food Force">Food Force</a> made by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> World Food Program and <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_Jungle_be07.html" title="Urban Jungle">Urban Jungle</a> - an educational traffic simulation.</p>
<p>3) In the third category, there is often forms of advertising within a game. This is similar to subtle advertising in films, where the advertising content is within the "world" of the movie or game. A fictional example is <a href="../../../p/e/p/Pepsi.html" title="Pepsi">Pepsi</a> banners lining the inside of a virtual Soccer stadium in a video game made by <a href="../../../e/a/_/EA_9614.html" title="EA">EA</a> Sports. A final (but weak) example is a regular banner ad in a free small-time browser strategy game. This can be a way to combat costs that the game makers encounter and reduce the cost of the game to the consumer (especially games with monthly fees) while providing an outlet to advertise ones product. It also currently helps many people sustain <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_online_games.html" title="Free online games">free online games</a>. However, this method of advertising, when used in offline games, is somewhat controversial as players may feel the game makers are being greedy by gaining money from the advertising but not offering the game at a reduced price.</p>
<p>With the growth of the internet, advergames have proliferated, often becoming the most visited aspect of brand websites and becoming an integrated part of brand media planning in an increasingly fractured media environment. LifeSavers started a game site called Candystand that has blossomed to a portal for many different advergames and at its peak was averaging more than 1 million unique visitors a month.<sup class="noprint">[<a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i><span title="These claims needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">citations needed</span></i></a>]</sup></p>
<p>Advergames theoretically promote repeated traffic to websites and reinforce brands. Users choose to register to be eligible for prizes which can help marketers collect customer data. Gamers may invite their friends to participate which could assist promotion from word of mouth, or "viral marketing".</p>

<ul>
<li>One of the most successful online advergaming portal has been Wrigley's Candystand.com. Launched by the LifeSavers Company in March 1997, Candystand.com reaches over 5MM unique users each month. The site features over 65 flash and shockwave games.</li>
<li>In November 2006, Burger King began selling three advergaming Xbox and Xbox 360 titles (Known as the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Games_8f40.html" title="King Games">King Games</a> series and entitled <i><a href="../../../s/n/e/Sneak_King_8bc8.html" title="Sneak King">Sneak King</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../p/o/c/Pocketbike_Racer_b1e5.html" title="Pocketbike Racer">Pocketbike Racer</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Bumpin%27_b25e.html" title="Big Bumpin'">Big Bumpin'</a></i>) for an additional $3.99 ($4.99 in Canada) each with any value meal. The games were developed by <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blitz_Games_0119.html" title="Blitz Games">Blitz Games</a> <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blitz_Arcade_bb79.html" title="Blitz Arcade">Blitz Arcade</a> Division and were the best selling games of the 2006 holiday season <a href="http://www.gamingnexus.com/Default.aspx?Section=FullNews&amp;I=3321/" class="external text" title="http://www.gamingnexus.com/Default.aspx?Section=FullNews&amp;I=3321/" rel="nofollow">Link</a>. More than 3.2 million copies are believed to have been sold in the US and Canada alone.</li>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/v/Advergaming.html" title="Edit section: Future of advergaming">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Future of advergaming</span></h2>
<p>As long as the game delivers a fun pay off, consumers consider it a relevant and valid cultural experience. In recent brand-impact studies, associating a brand with the fun of gaming is known to lift brand metrics such as brand awareness, message association and purchase intent. After playing a game, consumers are more likely to remember not just the brand or product itself, but to associate specific brand attributes with it.</p>
<p>The advergame industry is expected to generate $312.2 million by 2009, up from $83.6 million in 2004, according to Boston research firm Yankee Group.</p>
