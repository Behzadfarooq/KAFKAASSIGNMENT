<p>A.I.M. is an organization of brilliant scientists and their hirelings dedicated to the acquisition of power and the overthrow of all governments by technological means. A.I.M. was organized late in World War II by <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baron_Strucker_bab3.html" title="Baron Strucker">Baron Wolfgang von Strucker</a> to develop advanced weaponry for his subversive organization <a href="../../../h/y/d/HYDRA_59a4.html" title="HYDRA">HYDRA</a>. They were close to developing and attaining nuclear weapons when HYDRA Island was invaded by American and Japanese troops. Although HYDRA suffered a major setback, it survived and grew in secret over the following decades.</p>
<p>A.I.M. has created three major implements of deadly potential which stand far above the rest of their accomplishments. The greatest of these was the <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmic_Cube_b0ef.html" title="Cosmic Cube">Cosmic Cube</a>, a device capable of <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reality_warper.html" title="Reality warper">altering reality</a>. A.I.M. did not realize that they had only manufactured the cubical containment device; the real power was an entity accidentally drawn into this dimension. The Cosmic Cube recently evolved into <a href="../../../k/u/b/Kubik.html" title="Kubik">Kubik</a>. The second was the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super-Adaptoid_be3a.html" title="Super-Adaptoid">Super-Adaptoid</a>, an android capable of mimicking the appearance and superpowers of other beings. The Super-Adaptoid's powers were made possible by incorporating a sliver of the Cosmic Cube into its form. When Kubik repossessed the sliver after defeating the Adaptoid, the android was rendered inanimate. A.I.M.'s third achievement was the creation of the <a href="../../../m/o/d/MODOK_74da.html" title="MODOK">MODOK</a> (<b>M</b>ental <b>O</b>rganism <b>D</b>esigned <b>O</b>nly for <b>K</b>illing), an artificially mutated human with an enormous head and psionic abilities. Modok was originally an ordinary AIM scientist who was selected by AIM's leader, the Scientist Supreme, to be the subject of the bionic and genetic experiments that turned him into MODOK. After his transformation, MODOK killed the Scientist Supreme and took control of A.I.M., and later took advantage of the organizational chaos following the destruction of HYDRA Island and the deaths of Baron Strucker and most of HYDRA's leading members to sever A.I.M.'s ties with HYDRA.</p>
<p>The organization is renowned for the '<a href="../../../b/e/e/Beekeeper.html" title="Beekeeper">beekeeper</a>' uniform of its underlings since the first appearance. This has continued to this day, with artists making it fearsome or ridiculous, depending on the needs of the story.</p>
<p>However, as a result of the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scorpion_%28comics%29.html" title="Scorpion (comics)">Poison Tomorrow</a> arc of <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amazing_Fantasy_7724.html" title="Amazing Fantasy">Amazing Fantasy</a>, AIM has gained a new costume, which tends towards insectoid armour and large guns. The organization was also revealed to have become a 'techno-anarchist' group, with no connection to HYDRA, and even a hatred for fascism. With the introduction of the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death%27s_Head_3.0_0b58.html" title="Death's Head 3.0">Death's Head 3.0</a> character, a pacifist future version of the organization is promised, with a surprise character as leader.</p>
<p>A.I.M. maybe connected somehow to the <a href="../../../l/i/v/Livewires.html" title="Livewires">Livewires</a> as one of their members, Cornfed, wears an AIM uniform. He also wears a button referencing "The Real AIM".</p>
<p>A.I.M. has also gone under some other fronts including Cadence Industries, IDIC and Koenig and Strey, Omnitech)</p>

<p>In the <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultimate_Marvel_6b67.html" title="Ultimate Marvel">Ultimate Marvel</a> world, the AIM commissioned the ultimate <a href="../../../m/a/d/Mad_Thinker_9c24.html" title="Mad Thinker">Mad Thinker</a> to steal <a href="../../../c/e/r/Cerebro.html" title="Cerebro">Cerebro</a> from the <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultimate_X-Men_a58d.html" title="Ultimate X-Men">Ultimate X-Men</a> and frame the <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultimate_Fantastic_Four_fa1b.html" title="Ultimate Fantastic Four">Ultimate Fantastic Four</a>, as seen in the <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultimate_X4_8edd.html" title="Ultimate X4">Ultimate X4</a> mini-series. Ultimate AIM's full purpose and function has yet to be revealed. The mini-series Ultimate Vision introduces AIM as comprised of several directorates spread across the globe, with George Tarleton as an AIM leader on an orbital research facility. Tarleton and his team attempted to take control of a <a href="../../../g/a/h/Gah_Lak_Tus_e2c1.html" title="Gah Lak Tus">Gah Lak Tus</a> module that was left behind in orbit after the swarm was driven away. Being unable to do so on their own, they lured Vision to the station to help them by claiming they would use the knowledge to order the Gah Lak Tus swarm to self-destruct. Once the cyborg Tarleton had connected to the module using Vision, he had the module fire an energy beam at her. Tarleton then incorporated the Gah Lak Tus' circuitry into his own body, but it has seemingly taken him over, transforming him more into a machine, with a monstrous appearance. He has since taken over the entire station remotely and has set it to plummet out of orbit, along with the Gah Lak Tus module, which he says has "unfinished business on Earth."</p>
