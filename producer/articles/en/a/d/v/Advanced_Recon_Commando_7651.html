<p>At the behest of their military advisors and the clone template (<a href="../../../j/a/n/Jango_Fett_2cf0.html" title="Jango Fett">Jango Fett</a>), the creators of the Clone Army of The Republic came to view their basic infantry clone troopers as only the first stage of a greater project. To combat the first stage army's shortcomings in dealing with more covert and delicate missions, two additional batches of clones were created. Both were genetically altered to grow as fast as all their brothers but one set was developed without behavior correction.[Star Wars Republic Commando: Triple Zero]</p>
<p>They began life on Kamino like any of their brothers, receiving their training through flash data, but as time passed the future ARC Troopers found themselves under the direct tutelage of Jango Fett. Under Jango's strict discipline they learned to use their fierce independence, innate creativity, and physical superiority beyond the limits that Jango had set. At the end of their training, due in large part to the Clone Masters' growing fear of their defiant nature, the ARC troopers were held in stasis on <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamino.html" title="Kamino">Kamino</a>. Only when the cloning facilities themselves became threatened by the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederacy_of_Independent_Systems_856b.html" title="Confederacy of Independent Systems">Confederacy of Independent Systems</a> were they activated. During the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Kamino_a766.html" title="Battle of Kamino">Battle of Kamino</a>, the ARC troopers were reintegrated into the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR).<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>As the ARCs took their place in the larger world, a great number developed distinct personalities due to their unaltered nature, some giving themselves names and others establishing relationships outside the GAR. Clone commando Fi of Omega Squad once called them "pretty well raw Jango"</p>

<p>Like the later Imperial Scouts, the BARC Troopers are primarily dispatched on ground-based missions. They wear lighter armor, and their gear incorporates comlinks, breathing gear, and macrobinocular lenses. They generally use lighter, more portable weapons than Imperial Scouts.</p>
<p>However, unlike the lightly armed and armored Speeder Bikes used by the Empire in later years, the BARC Troopers, who primarily see action on Kashyyyk, the <a href="../../../w/o/o/Wookiee.html" title="Wookiee">Wookiee</a> homeworld, use the fast, highly agile <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Wars_ground_vehicles_eaf5.html#BARC_speeder" title="List of Star Wars ground vehicles">BARC speeder bike</a>, which is both better armored and better armed than later Bikes used by the Empire, though it lacks the saddlebags mounted to the side. BARC Troopers normally wear the armor of whatever legion they are assigned to. For example, they wear camouflage armor on Kashyyyk, and the armor of the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Wars_clone_trooper_legions_f8b2.html#327th_Star_Corps" title="List of Star Wars clone trooper legions">327th Star Corps</a> on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Wars_planets_%28E-G%29_b9d9.html#Felucia" title="List of Star Wars planets (E-G)">Felucia</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/v/Advanced_Recon_Commando_7651.html" title="Edit section: Null-ARC troopers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Null-ARC troopers</span></h3>
<p>The <b>Null-ARC troopers</b> are the result of an unsuccessful Kaminoan attempt to make <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supersoldier.html" title="Supersoldier">super-soldier</a> clones of Jango Fett. The genetic tampering resulted in unstable, erratic clone troopers loyal only to Sergeant <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kal_Skirata_8ba6.html" title="Kal Skirata">Kal Skirata</a>, a <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandalorian.html" title="Mandalorian">Mandalorian</a> contracted by Kamino to aid with the training of special clone units, and only six of the twelve survived past the fetal stage. The Null-ARCs, as they become known, are a failed experiment that the Kaminoans did not try to replicate, instead resigning themselves to less spectacular clonings of their <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bounty_hunter.html" title="Bounty hunter">bounty hunter</a> template. They wanted to "recondition" the troopers, which consisted of destroying them, but Kal Skirata wouldn't allow them to, and this experience led the troopers to only obey the orders of Kal Skirata and any others that he told them to.</p>
<p>During the Clone Wars, the Galactic Republic employs the Null-ARC, or Ø-ARC units as black-ops forces. Their roles cover special operations such as work for <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_intelligence.html" title="Military intelligence">military intelligence</a>, among others. They are very difficult to control, by most accounts, and often Sergeant Skirata has to be called off of Kamino to help with giving them directives. Finally the Republic returns Skirata to active duty and places the Null-ARCs under his command. Supposedly, Skirata's favorite Null ARC is Captain Ordo.</p>
<p>Skirata saved the Nulls when he had just arrived on Kamino. He was moved by their age and was unwilling to let the Kaminoans kill the Nulls because they didn't meet specifications. He was horrified to know that the Kaminoans would kill young Mandalorian clones as quality control. Skirata felt that the clones should not have a shorter life because of the growth acceleration and that the clones should know their Mandalorian roots. He also felt that the clones were unrecognized and used as slaves. Some facts are the nulls are 35% smarter than even the most elite Republic Commandos, Also Nulls are usually deployed in some of the most dangerous missions because of their expertise.</p>
<p>In the latest Star Wars book <i>Bloodlines</i>, it is implied that the Null-ARCs have found a way to circumvent their advanced aging and at least a few are still alive. One example is when Boba Fett's daughter, Ailyn, kills a clone, thinking it was Fett. It is mentioned that the clone that was killed possessed a Verpine rifle, which was a favorite weapon among the Nulls and their leader, Kal Skirata. There are also rumors that Skirata and the Nulls had finally tracked down Ko Sai, the lead scientist in Kaminoan cloning, and returned her to Kamino in pieces, presumably after they had extracted all necessary information from her. Finally, there are rumors of a Fett clone residing on Mandalore voicing his opinion on how the current Mandalore, Boba Fett, should act.</p>
