<p>Hey, I just saw your comment on my talk page, hadn't logged in in a while. The current revision of the Yzak page seemed okay, but I'll keep an eye on it, thanks for the heads up.--Lord Shitzu 21:48, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Saw you changed Athrun Zala's ethnic background to German or Central European. Is there anything offical that says this? As far as I can tell the offical site merely says his father Patrick was born in the Atlantic Federation, which is why I'd used that.<a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdward321_0e26.html" title="User:Edward321">Edward321</a> 03:40, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Since I'm the one that did the format (mainly somewhat as an imitation of the Tenchi GXP character format), I think I will go ahead and change the TOC as suggested.</p>
<p>What's your position on the inclusion of minor characters? I assumed it was OK since it was done on the GXP page.<a href="../../../e/m/p/User%7EEmperorBrandon_d992.html" title="User:EmperorBrandon">EmperorBrandon</a> 23:11, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hmm... Pretty Sammy template might be an interesting idea. I'll see if I can make one. To be included on template: Pixy Misa, Ramia, Rumiya, Chihiro, Ginji, Honoka, Eimi, Konoha, Hiroto, Kenji, (minor character), (monster of the week). Sound OK? <a href="../../../e/m/p/User%7EEmperorBrandon_d992.html" title="User:EmperorBrandon">EmperorBrandon</a> 23:33, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah, once I move the main characters of the OVA series and TV series to the template, there should not be any problem keeping the minor characters, there, so I may not add them at this time (though it can be moved later if there is a problem). I'll keep my monster info on my user page, but I don't want to add them to the template until I have description on each one (which I don't feel like doing right now).</p>
<p>BTW, do you think we should add some pictures of Ryo-Ohki's many forms on her/his page, provided they are a safe distance from the spoiler line? I have a comparison picture of Ryo-Ohki's humanoid form in OVA and TV series of Pretty Sammy. I could even add his look from the little-known Pretty Sammy games for an interesting comparison (since he looks vastly different there. I've had permission to use the screencaps of the game in one of my avatars before, so I may be able to get the webmaster's permission). If it's not needed, it's OK, though. Ryo-Ohki's Pretty Sammy section may need some expanding first, too. <a href="../../../e/m/p/User%7EEmperorBrandon_d992.html" title="User:EmperorBrandon">EmperorBrandon</a> 00:03, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm likely to be pretty busy this week so probably won't have time to do anything extensive with making a template. As long as we have space when the rest of the descriptions are entered, all I may need to do is just create a separate page if I want to include the monster-of-the-week list, so I haven't dismissed the alternatives. You can edit the Pretty Sammy template I made if you want to; it's pretty much only a carbon copy of part of the Tenchi Muyo! template at this point. <a href="../../../e/m/p/User%7EEmperorBrandon_d992.html" title="User:EmperorBrandon">EmperorBrandon</a> 06:00, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It probably would be best just to keep the minor characters and monsters-of-the-week on the same page. There are some I classified as "Minor" that I may want to keep on the main page, like Misao's parents. While not as important as those I labeled "Recurring" they do appear in several episodes and are more important that other minor characters. May just want to keep all of the currently listed OVA characters on the main page, too, since they all have some degree of importance given the shortness of the OVA series. <a href="../../../e/m/p/User%7EEmperorBrandon_d992.html" title="User:EmperorBrandon">EmperorBrandon</a> 22:33, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sure, go ahead, but could you please keep Biff, Makoto, and Hiroshi on the main page. They are quite notable in the OVA (and while they recur, I don't think Ayeka's Henchwomen are that significant, but it's your call). My suggestion would be to give the article a nice and simple title like "Minor characters in Pretty Sammy" (or the like). The monsters can be included on it under a separate heading (feel free to use my monster-of-the-week info on my user page if you want to) <a href="../../../e/m/p/User%7EEmperorBrandon_d992.html" title="User:EmperorBrandon">EmperorBrandon</a> 03:55, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is one of the voices in the Tenchi dub cast that I'm still not quite sure on. Some sources credit him to "John Lee", a name that appears in the VHS dub cast credits for episode 13 (but keep in mind that this was a list of names, not credited to the role). I am pretty certain that John Lee is <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Rafter_Lee_60a6.html" title="John Rafter Lee">John Rafter Lee</a>, since he is a regular voice actor in dubs directed by <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Fletcher_eb90.html" title="Jack Fletcher">Jack Fletcher</a>. From what I remember hearing him as Aristotle in Reign, though, he has a pretty deep voice that is much closer to how <a href="../../../a/z/u/Azusa_Jurai_8dbb.html" title="Azusa Jurai">Azusa Jurai</a> sounds than does Seiryo. On the other hand, I still cannot be sure <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_DeMita_7279.html" title="John DeMita">John DeMita</a> (who is also in the VHS credits for the episode) is voicing Seiryo either. His other roles in the Tenchiverse which he has been attributed to in databases are uncredited, and don't know him too much from elsewhere (Dosu Kinuta in Naruto doesn't really sound similar; may have to look at his Princess Mononoke role again). --<a href="../../../e/m/p/User%7EEmperorBrandon_d992.html" title="User:EmperorBrandon">EmperorBrandon</a> 18:21, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As you may have noticed, I added voice actors to the character profiles on the latest additions, because this is the preferred method of mentioning them in series articles (rather than a list). I am going to go ahead and remove the remaining lists and reattach the VA's to their characters in a consistent format. Be sure to message me if you have any feedback about the format. Placing them breaked after the kanji/kana seems to look nicely IMO, but I'm open if you have some different ideas on what to do. --<a href="../../../e/m/p/User%7EEmperorBrandon_d992.html" title="User:EmperorBrandon">EmperorBrandon</a> 03:34, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do have one thing in particular to ask about Tenchi Muyo! GPX on aliases. Now, there is some concern about outing voice actors connecting aliases due to ethical concerns regarding the <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voice_acting.html#SAG_and_aliases" title="Voice acting">SAG</a>. However, it seems several people editing Wikipedia (you're not the only one) are really intent on connecting them anyway. I don't really have much of a problem with it. It's only natural for fans to want to know the full body of work of a particular actor or actress. I am concerned a little bit, but I guess it should not be too much of a problem in the case of Tenchi Muyo! GXP. When FUNimation posted the cast list on the original website, they even told us to check databases for aliases. A few are not really surprising at all since they appeared in some of the other Tenchi series (all but the early OVA episodes and GXP are SAG-sanctioned) with their real names credited with the same voice.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So, I guess connecting voices to their real names is assumed when I edit the information in. I'm not really sure on some things, though, the format [real name] (credited as "alias") just seems to add a lot of garbage (IMO) that's not really needed since most of this information has been edited into the actor pages. I'm really wanting to do just plain [real name] when mentioning the English VA, with no mention of the alias at all. There is a kind of compromise position where I could use a piped link [real name|alias], thus the alias is the only thing that appears on the page but the alternate text shows the real name and it links to that page. Do you have any preference on what I do? GXP is going to be a pretty big edit, so I want to know beforehand. --<a href="../../../e/m/p/User%7EEmperorBrandon_d992.html" title="User:EmperorBrandon">EmperorBrandon</a> 05:12, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I, too, would like to make sure that any confusion is cleared up on the subject. If you have the same version of the DVD that I do it should list the cast on the inside of the DVD case. If you look down to the fifth, sixth and seventh names on that list it says that Hiei, Botan and Keiko are all played by Veronica Taylor. Hope this clears up any confusion there was. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMushrambo_a75b.html" title="User:Mushrambo">Mushrambo</a> 06:07, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I haven't seen the second movie of YYH at this point, so I don't know whether it's Veronica Taylor or Shannon Conley voicing Keiko, but... I think the CrystalAcids entry is likely trustworthy. Credits can be misleading or erroneous at times, though, so if Keiko doesn't sound like Taylor (who has a pretty distinctive voice for the most part) then it probably isn't her. If you have never heard Shannon Conley before, I could make some voice clips of her since I have a few shows she's voiced in on DVD. --<a href="../../../e/m/p/User%7EEmperorBrandon_d992.html" title="User:EmperorBrandon">EmperorBrandon</a> 06:28, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hi there. I noticed you're fan of the <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon_Ball_86ec.html" title="Dragon Ball">Dragon Ball</a> series, and I'm trying to recruit some fans from here to contribute to the <a href="http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Dragon Ball Wiki</a>. It's in terrible shape right now with pretty much no consistency or policies, and only this week have I been able to get <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESannse_0094.html" title="User:Sannse">Sannse</a> to create some Forums for us over there. I've got a proposed <a href="http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Forum:Manual_of_Style" class="external text" title="http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Forum:Manual_of_Style" rel="nofollow">Manual of Style</a> going over there and would like some people to contribute to that to set up some policies and start making the wiki bigger, better, and more intelligible/consistent. If you're interested, please <a href="http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">hop on over</a> or <a href="http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/User_talk:Wildyoda" class="external text" title="http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/User_talk:Wildyoda" rel="nofollow">talk to me</a>.

<p>Thanks for the tips. I'm going to do those changes now, then move it into the mainspace.</p>
<p>As for watching, Gundam Wing is all I know. I'd like to get into Universal Century, but don't know where to start. -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">saberwyn</a> 21:51, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I'll let you know. As for simple summaries, I agree. If you want to know what happens blow-by-blow in the episode, go buy the DVD. (As an aside, because it has been so long since I've seen the episodes, I've been using your episode list to write the character/mecha plot summaries.) -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">saberwyn</a> 10:00, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I just noticed your edit to Episode 37 of Fullmetal Alchemist. However, your changes to that episode's title is unneccessary as not only is the previous version the correct one as I have my DVD to prove it but also it unintentionally caused it to become of broken link so could you please not revert it back. -<a href="../../../a/d/v/User%7EAdv193_78a0.html" title="User:Adv193">Adv193</a> 21:32, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, I would have to disagree with you, "Flame Alchemist" was the episode title while Bachelor Lieutenant &amp; the Mystery of Warehouse 13 were the "Act titles". But, my bad for breaking the link. -Fractyl</dd>
