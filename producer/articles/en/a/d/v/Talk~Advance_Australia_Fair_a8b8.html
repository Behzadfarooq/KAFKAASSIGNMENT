<p>Referring to the discussion in the article about the swagman, I agree that Australians do identify with "his precarious existence, his stubborn defiance of authority" and "his working-class status", but I don't see how he is "defying the odds". He stole a sheep then drowned himself; surely there is nothing "lucky" in that?</p>

<p>I removed the line which made the claim that the anthem is largely viewed as 'uninspiring' when compared with anthems of certain other countries. This statement made as one person's opinion would be an obviously subjective view, let alone it being represented as a commonly held opinion.</p>
<hr />
<p>I have toned down the negative attitude to the anthem present in the article. Firstly, I would heartily disagree with the statement that "few" know the words. Yes, it's not universal, I would argue that particularly older Australians struggle sometimes, but I would think that a majority of Australians can now do a decent rendition. Secondly, nobody argues that we should go back to God Save The Queen. Waltzing Matilda is a point of contention, agreed, and the current edit reflects it. Finally, it seems worth mentioning some of the other patriotic songs, including Land Down Under and Peter Allen's classic.--<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Merkel_dd17.html" title="User:Robert Merkel">Robert Merkel</a></p>

<dd>Regarding 'few knowing the words', Geoffery Robertson demonstrated this on his Hypotheticals program when asking the panel the second verse.

<p>I have an issue with the comparison with the Star Spangled Banner (SSB). I think this is very un-NPOV and should be radically altered.</p>
<p>Firstly, whether some tune is or is not "easier to sing" than any other tune you care to name, is very much a subjective judgement. I, for one, while disagreeing with many current American behaviours and attitudes, have nevertheless always loved the tune of the SSB, and I would disagree that Advance Australia Fair is easier to sing.</p>
<p>But whether I agree or not, I think this comparison entirely misses the point of the article. The article is about Advance Australia Fair, which exists in its own right and has whatever merits it has. The sentence "At least it's easier to sing than ...", makes Advance Australia Fair only marginally better than an anthem the writer appears to dislike, and so whatever the intention of the comparison was, all the reader understands is that it's being damned with faint praise, which is utterly demeaning.</p>
<p>Who says the SSB is the benchmark against which other anthems are to be measured? Who says there should be any benchmark at all? I think this comparison displays an anti-American attitude on the part of the writer. Such an attitude may be completely justified in general terms, but what on earth is it doing in an article on the national anthem of another country? It is irrelevant. The article is not about the writer's attitude to America or any other country, it is about "Advance Australia Fair".

<dd>In a related topic, not being from an English-speaking country, I have never heard "Waltzing Matilda" performed. In fact, before reading about it here on Wikipedia I didn't even know it existed. I read the lyrics though, and although I have no idea of how it sounds when set to music, it appeared to me that it would not make such a good national anthem. I mean, I'm sure the song must be beautiful, but I really do think that "Advance Australia Fair" was indeed the better choice — how nice it is to hear a national anthem that doesn't allude to war, death or vengeance, Australians are to be commended for chosing that song! <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 23:22, 17 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Was the third version really performed in the presence of the PM? It's something you see doing the email rounds and stuff like that saying that it was the original version of the song (something the article confusingly says too) and how we've forgotten god and stuff like that. And what does it mean the song is "is only authorised for use on religious occassions." As far as I know there is at the moment no law saying you're not allowed to sing whatever song you like (although who knows what's in those laws he's proposed at the moment), but it's not the national anthem. In short, I don't beleive it belongs in this article (if it does, I propose that Adam Hills' "Whoa-o-o-o Advance Australia Fair" lyrics belong here too).</p>
<p>On an unrelated note (other than its about this article about our anthem), did the dance remix really get a "mixed reaction"?, everyone I've talked to + the news story + <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Dickson_30dd.html" title="Ian Dickson">Dicko</a> said it was comlete rubbish. <a href="../../../b/j/m/User%7EBjmurph_6b29.html" title="User:Bjmurph">Bjmurph</a> 14:27, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hey, whoever wrote the explanation of why Waltzing Matilda would be an unsuitable national anthem, it is hilarious, intentionally or not. Just wanted to say that.</p>

<p>The material under the heading 'version for religious occasions' is wrong. There is no verse of the song/anthem penned by PD McCormick that reads as follows, or similar:</p>
<p>With Christ our head and cornerstone,</p>
<p>We'll build our Nation's might.</p>
<p>Whose way and truth and light alone</p>
<p>Can guide our path aright.</p>
<p>Our lives, a sacrifice of love, reflect our Master's care.</p>
<p>With faces turned to heaven above, Advance Australia fair.</p>
<p>In joyful strains then let us sing, Advance Australia fair.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://www.hamilton.net.au/advance.html" class="external free" title="http://www.hamilton.net.au/advance.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hamilton.net.au/advance.html</a> for a debunking of the myth. To say that a three-verse version is "[t]he original version of the anthem that is only authorised for use on religious occasions" is self-evidently wrong: firstly because, as set out earlier on the page, the original version was five verses long; and secondly because there are no shortage of official government pages on the anthem, which:</p>
<p>a) confirm that the work is out of copyright and so cannot be "authorised" or de-authorised for use by anyone, and</p>
<p>b) contain no reference to there being any 'version' for use on religious occasions.</p>
<p>I've not edited the page myself as I'll leave it to those with more time/expertise. It's obviously a sufficiently well-circulated myth that it should still be referred to on the page, just under the heading of "Supposed 'religious' verse" or similar.</p>

<p>I've removed the cicumlocution/euphemism about how the anthem is criticised as being "unsuitable" and returned it to the criticism that it is ininspired. This is indeed a frequent criticism. Citation from Australian media is possible if this becomes a major point of contention.</p>
<p>I also plan to move on the "third verse authorised for religious occasions" section. This is an internet urban legend with no apparent substantiation in fact.</p>

<dd>Hmm..I did some searching around on Google and I did see some mentions of it, but only on forums and blog postings. I do not think it will be important enough to include in the article since no one has been documented as doing this and getting either public rebuke or admiration from it. It doesn't add anything to the article IMHO, since there are plenty of songs that their lyrics can fit the tune of other songs (I can easily stick the US anthem words to the Russian anthem) and some guy sung O Canada to a Christmas carol. However, unlike the Aussie Anthem/Gilligan's Isle connection, both of the examples I bring actually happened, documented and responses given.

<dd>There is much "fun facts" about songs, films and other items that have existed in the world. But a lot of them cause no significance to the subject matter. While there are many possible ways to sing a song, it is not our goal to list them all and even if we list them all, they will serve no purpose in the article other than just being there. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">User:Zscout370</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Return Fire)</a></sup></small> 04:04, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's quite a popular act of his, and has even sold records. IMHO, it's much more worthy of note than a one-off performance of a dance remix at the 2004 NYE celebrations.

<p>There are similar comments (on national anthems set to different tunes) in the articles <a href="../../../g/o/d/God_Save_the_Queen_65ab.html" title="God Save the Queen">God Save the Queen</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Star-Spangled_Banner_2d02.html" title="The Star-Spangled Banner">The Star-Spangled Banner</a> and <a href="../../../o/_/c/O_Canada_ad40.html" title="O Canada">O Canada</a>. So if it's good enough in those articles, why not this one? Also, if someone had heard AAF to the tune of <i>Working Class Man</i>, but didn't know who was the singer, and wanted to know more about it, he'd go this article rather than the <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Hills_fd42.html" title="Adam Hills">Adam Hills</a> article.
