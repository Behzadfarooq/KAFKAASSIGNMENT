	    <p>Dear Commissioner Dixon, other Commissioners of ANC 6C and members of the anc6c Yahoo group,</p>
<p><br />
Rather than having you find out second hand or through the media, I wanted to let you know that on Wednesday, I filed a Notice of Intention to Recall regarding Commissioner Rivera, on behalf of a sizeable group of residents in SMD 6C-05. I received my copy of the filing today from the BOEE, so I assume Commissioner Rivera received his copy today as well.</p>
<p>I apologize in advance for the length of this email, but I think it is important to explain the situation thoroughly.</p>
<p>To help you understand why we are seeking to recall Commissioner Rivera, here is an email I sent to other concerned neighbors:</p>
<p>Dear Neighbors,</p>
<p>As you know, I ran for ANC Commissioner in our neighborhood in 2004, losing to current ANC Commissioner Anthony Rivera by 16 votes out of 858 votes cast (Michael Cucciardo ran a strong 3rd). I also have been active in the neighborhood, and now that I have gotten past some health issues, I am in the process of re-ngaging and becoming even more involved (for example, I organized and participated in a street cleanup while I was still on crutches--I could walk short distances leaning on the broom). Moreover, I still independently maintain a website for issues in our neighborhood (and a community calendar) at www.alankimber.org. While parts of it are a bit out of date, I will be updating it soon.</p>
<p>In short, I care deeply about our neighborhood and what happens to it (and my neighbors) in the future as a result of the many pressures the ANC is dealing with at the present time.</p>
<p>With some reluctance, I am writing you to solicit your support and assistance for a recall campaign against Commissioner Rivera. My reluctance stems from the fact that the power of recall is one that I believe should be exercised only sparingly and only as a last resort, the fact that the latest issues surrounding Commissioner Rivera have not been resolved, and I am generally reluctant to rely on hearsay rather than first-hand knowledge. Nonetheless, I believe a recall is warranted for the following reasons:</p>
<p>1. As I'm sure you are aware, Commissioner Rivera has been indicted by a grand jury (along with former Commissioner Rob Hall and another individual) on 10 counts, including conspiracy, bank fraud, mail fraud and money laundering. While Commissioner Rivera is certainly entitled to the presumption of innocence until proven guilty, the charges are very serious and reflect very badly on his character. Moreover, the indictment sets forth a paper trail of canceled checks and other documentation that lays out quite a clear allegation that Commissioner Rivera was in fact involved in these activities.</p>
<p>2. MUCH MORE IMPORTANT than Commissioner Rivera's guilt or innocence in connection with the alleged fraud scheme, I am concerned that as a result of having to prepare and participate in his defense, and working under the cloud of the very serious criminal charges, Commissioner Rivera will not be able to be an effective representative of his constituents on the many issues facing our neighborhood. In fact, I wish him well on his defense, I just don't want our neighborhood to suffer as a result.</p>
<p>3. I understand through various contacts that the ANC was unable to amend its Bylaws to add an ethics provision prohibiting conflicts of interest until a new Commissioner replaced Commissioner Crews--due to the refusal of Commissioner Rivera and at least one other Commissioner to support such a reasonable (and necessary!) protection for consituents.</p>
<p>4. I understand through various contacts that before he was removed as Chair of the Zoning Subcommittee, Rivera regularly failed to write and send letters expressing the will of the ANC on various development and zoning issues--meaning that the "great weight" afforded to the ANC on such matters was not carried out and conveyed to the higher levels of DC government.</p>
<p>5. Neither I, nor anyone that I know of has ever received any notice from Commissioner Rivera of meetings or presentations that impact our neighborhood, nor received any newsletter or other form of updating constituents of issues affecting our neighborhood.</p>
<p>6. I understand through various contacts that Commissioner Rivera has at times engaged in very erratic and irresponsible behavior--such as trespassing on the active construction site at the Children's Museum site for no reason other than he wanted to "look around".</p>
<p>I urge you to consider the situation and agree that we cannot risk the possibility of having continued neffective or ultimately no representation on the ANC--again (Rob Hall resigned too late for his vacancy to be filled, leaving us with no representation when the Children's Museum and other projects and issues were before the ANC). No vacancy on the ANC may be filled if the vacancy occurs within 6 months of the next election for ANC Commissioners. As a result, if Commissioner Rivera is not removed or does not resign with enough time for the BOEE to determine that there is a vacancy and publish its determination prior to May 7, 2006, there will be no opportunity to replace him until the election on November 7, 2006--leaving our area without representation on the many, many development, policing, neighborhood stability and licensing issues that remain pressing in our neighborhood.</p>
<p>While I had hoped that Commissioner Rivera would do the right thing and resign, I cannot stand by and watch our neighborhood have either ineffective or no representation on the ANC.</p>
<p>Therefore, I am writing you to ask for your help in mounting a recall campaign to remove Commissioner Rivera. So that there is no misunderstanding, I intend to seek the responsibility of serving out the balance of Commissioner Rivera's term.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, with the pressure of the VOH articles and editorial, and the prospect of a recall campaign, Commissioner Rivera will decide to step down rather than dragging things out.</p>
<p>Please let me know either way, whether you are willing to support this effort. If you are in support, please also let me know whether you are willing to assist in collecting the required number of signatures (and what area you can cover). I thank you for your time and consideration.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Alan Kimber 228 Parker Street NE</p>
