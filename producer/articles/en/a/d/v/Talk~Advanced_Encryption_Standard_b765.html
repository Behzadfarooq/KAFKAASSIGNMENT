<p>The article says 'some experts doubt that it is really as secure as it should be for important applications'.</p>
<p>Which experts?</p>
<p>-- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Bruce Schneier and Rich Schroeppel are two who come to mind. A few others seem to have vague doubts. I should point out that Rijndael has not actually been broken, and in fact it has been proven mathematically that some of the more popular methods can't break it. The main worry is that the whole thing looks too simple, and has more algebraic structure than is normal for a block cipher. There is a possibility that some new kind of algebraic attack might exist.</p>
<p>If you trawl through the AES website, you can find the public comments, and quite a few there thought Rijndael was too simple. (Note that not all the comments are by experts though&#160;:-) When the final choice was announced, Schneier said</p>
<p>"I believe that within the next five years someone will discover an academic attack against Rijndael. I do not believe that anyone will ever discover an attack that will allow someone to read Rijndael traffic. So while I have serious academic reservations about Rijndael, I do not have any engineering reservations about Rijndael."</p>
<p>which is not the most ringing endorsement you could hope for.</p>
<p>I have seen a draft of a paper by Ferguson, Schroeppel and Whiting, pointing out all sorts of interesting algebraic properties of Rijndael, of a kind that make some people nervous, but without actually finding a break. Not sure if they managed to get it published yet, or if so where.</p>
<p>So my statement in the article might be just slightly too strong as it is, but we should probably convey somehow that not all the experts find Rijndael completely convincing.</p>
<dl>
<dd>When did Bruce Schneier raise doubts about AES? Is there a published paper about this that you can point me to? To my knowledge, Schneier even recommends AES to be used instead of his very own Blowfish in new designs, despite the fact that, to date, there are no known vulnerabilities to the Blowfish. <a href="../../../k/1/_/User%7EK1_d397.html" title="User:K1">--K1</a> 11:14, 21 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmm...AES is now essentially synonymous with Rijndael; the a minor technical difference isn't worth having two pages (Rijndael has a wider range of block sizes specified). My suggestion would be to merge <a href="../../../r/i/j/Rijndael.html" title="Rijndael">Rijndael</a> and <a href="../../../a/e/s/AES_76b7.html" title="AES">AES</a>, and the discussion of the competition and other finalists can remain in <a href="../../../a/e/s/AES_competition_4da8.html" title="AES competition">AES competition</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt</a> 03:32, 14 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Matt, Imran's got the right of it here, I think. AES =/= Rijndael quite. There are permitted block length differences if nothing else. That sort of thing probably doesn't belong in AES, aside from a note about the not quite exact identity of the two, but does belong in Rijndael. Reactions? <a href="../../../w/w/_/User%7EWw_6383.html" title="User:Ww">ww</a> 19:42, 14 Jul 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The difference is hairsplitting, really, and since Rijndael has been adopted as the AES, they are used synonymously in practice. I don't think it's sustainable to have two separate articles based on a small technicality when a single sentence in the lead section of AES would suffice. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt</a> 20:01, 14 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This might be out of scope of the article but how does AES 256 compare to blowfish and other algorythms in issues such as encryption time, hypothetical security etc</p>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding encryption time, Rijndael was chosen as AES over a number of other candidates in part because of its good performance over a range of platforms (this should, at some stage, be explained in the <a href="../../../a/e/s/AES_process_a12e.html" title="AES process">AES process</a> article). To be honest, you'd probably want to compare <a href="../../../t/w/o/Twofish.html" title="Twofish">Twofish</a> with AES in this regard, rather than Blowfish. Blowfish has a very complex key schedule, which means that it takes a lot of time to process the key before encryption can take place — Rijndael is faster in this respect.</dd>
<dd>No problems with the security of any of AES, Twofish or Blowfish have been established. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 13:06, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, I'm beginning the work on this. I am doing this by creating a series of sub-articles which describe various aspects of AES' algorithm in more detail. I have already written articles on the <a href="../../../r/i/j/Rijndael_Galois_field_1b00.html" title="Rijndael Galois field">Rijndael Galois field</a> and <a href="../../../r/i/j/Rijndael_S-box_caea.html" title="Rijndael S-box">Rijndael S-box</a>. I need to write an article on Rindael's key schedule, write a Rijndael test vectors article, and a Rijndael Mix column article. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamboy_e9bc.html" title="User:Samboy">Samboy</a> 08:56, 18 May 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree that we should be describing the algorithm entirely. However, I'm not sure I agree on how we should best do this — in particular, I'm not sure we should be describing it from a view for implementation (as in, "here's some C code for multiplying in a Galois Field" etc). Perhaps that might be better in Wikibooks? Similarly, test vectors might be better off given within Wikisource. I think we could fit the entire description onto one page. Anyway, I'm not totally sure what I think, but I'm glad you're interested in helping improve this article&#160;;-) <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 10:53, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the input. I agree that C examples have the following two issues:
<ul>
<li>They are useless to someone who doesn't know C. There are at least two different public domain implementations of C out there for people willing to work with C code.</li>
<li>They may violate the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genre.html" title="Genre">Genre</a> of an encyclopedia. Actually, I'm hitting a similiar <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genre.html" title="Genre">Genre</a> problem with the article for <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bell_numbers.html" title="Bell numbers">Bell numbers</a>. A lot of math articles in Wikipedia are written for people who have a BS or higher in Mathematics; however the underlying concept of a Bell number (and even a method for calculating one) is simple enough that an intelligent elementry school kid can understand what is going on if the information is presented correctly. Unlike history or a lot of social sciences, a lot more care should be made to make a given concept accessible to an average reader.</li>

<dd>I think psudo-code will work better. In the case of multiplying two number's in AES' Galois Field, I already have psudo-code that does this (in the article, no less).</dd>
<dd>Anyway, I won't have time to address these issues until this weekend. In the meantime, I'll explain that AES can be speeded up on a 32-bit computer with 4k (or even 1k) of table space by table lookup on the main Rijndael article. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamboy_e9bc.html" title="User:Samboy">Samboy</a> 18:28, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>One thought that occurred to me: rather than integrating implementation-specific information for each component of the cipher, how about collecting it all in an "Implementation aspects" section? If it gets too large, we might consider splitting it out into an Implementation aspects of AES article. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 01:25, 19 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>That sounds like a good idea. Merges are always a good thing. The only thing is that we should move it to the Implementation aspects of AES article if this article becomes bigger than 32k. As an interesting aside, <a href="../../../x/t/e/XTEA_3d9d.html" title="XTEA">XTEA</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blowfish.html" title="Blowfish">Blowfish</a> have faster speeds on PCs than AES does, but AES kills them on 8-bit smart cards (and, presumably, dedicated hardware; AES killed RC6 with the NSA did their <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/CryptoToolkit/aes/round2/NSA-AESfinalreport.pdf" class="external text" title="http://csrc.nist.gov/CryptoToolkit/aes/round2/NSA-AESfinalreport.pdf" rel="nofollow">hardware speed tests</a> PDF file; I assume that XTEA and Blowfish will have similar problems). <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamboy_e9bc.html" title="User:Samboy">Samboy</a> 04:49, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I appologise for not discussing the changes I made to the Rijndael article (<a href="../../../r/i/j/Rijndael.html" title="Rijndael">Rijndael</a>); I'm new to Wikipedia and didn't realise this was what I should/could do (plus I didnt see your comments that I should discuss this). Anyway, I suppose your right that it sounds better as "AES standard", but its still redundant. The term "GPL license" was changed on the same article (to "GPL-licensed") due to it being redundant, so I dont see why this shouldn't be. Agiain, please accept my appologies for the changes that I made. Thanks.</p>

<dd>Thanks for dropping me a note! Almost always if there's disagreement about the content, the best thing to do is to enter into discussion, usually on the talk page (<strong class="selflink">Talk:Advanced Encryption Standard</strong>) — I'll copy this here so that other editors will see it too. At least to me, the phrase <i>the AES standard</i> sounds better, and it's used even by NIST (the standards body that specified AES): <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=site%3Anist.gov+%22the+aes+standard%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=site%3Anist.gov+%22the+aes+standard%22" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 20:15, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article states "The largest publicly-known brute-force attack has been against a 64 bit RC5 key by distributed.net (finishing in 2002; Moore's Law implies that this is roughly equivalent to an attack on a 66-bit key today)." It does not say if it was against AES, when i began, how many hosts or how much processing power was used. with these details this passage means nothing. i came to this article look for something to that effect but did not find it.</p>

<p>I don't think it's POV to say that Bernstein's demonstration of his timing attack was artificial - in fact, I'm sure he'd agree, since it was meant as a proof of concept. It's the thing you'd do first to demonstrate such an attack. You'd then move on to try to demonstrate it on a real protocol, or over a longer network link, or similar. That hasn't been done yet, but that's no proof that it's impossible. I think the article represented the current state of knowledge and discussion about the attack very well as it was. — ciphergoth 09:54, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Minor point, but I used the article to help me write an implementation in C# (and yes, I know there's one built into the .NET framework).</p>
<p>In the "<a href="../../../a/d/v/Advanced_Encryption_Standard_ba2a.html#The_ShiftRows_step" title="Advanced Encryption Standard">The ShiftRows Step</a>" Section:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"... In case of 256 bit block first row is unchanged and the shifting for second, third and fourth row is 1 byte, 2 byte and 4 byte respectively."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This demented me while trying to get the 256 bit version working. It would appear from my limited and humble studies (i'm not a cryptographer) that this is simply not true. According to the known ciphertexts for known values and keys (fips-test-vectors.txt -see <a href="http://svn.saddi.com/rijndael/trunk/" class="external text" title="http://svn.saddi.com/rijndael/trunk/" rel="nofollow">this page</a>) the algorithm only produces the known CTs when the 256-bit case is treated the same as the 128 and 192 cases. Besides, there's only 4 bytes - shifting left or right 4 places would leave the bytes in their original positions, like the first row.</p>

<dd>It looks like you're confusing key size and block size.

<dd>Hmm, yes, you're absolutely right. Told you I wasn't a cryptographer&#160;:) Do you mind if I make a change to clarify this - the article is about AES (being a specific use of Rijndael), If there is consensus I could add a small note that the change in the ShiftRows step only applies to the general algorithm with different block sizes - and not to AES in particular. --<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomcully_4727.html" title="User:Tomcully">Tomcully</a> 11:55, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>FIPS 197, and the book by Rijndael's designers, present the round steps in a different but equivalent way. Basically, they say AES consists of AddRoundKey, then rounds consisting of (SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, AddRoundKey), then a final round (SubBytes, ShiftRows, AddRoundKey). Might be a good idea to adopt that presentation, since it seems the more popular one. Trevp 09:47, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I could understand deleting all links to products in the article. Although in my opinion hardly a wise move it would be at least consistent. Tomstdenis, however, has deleted just some links to products he deems "commercial". The criterion used is very murky: a site of a company that sells products is apparently inherently bad, while the site of a person who sells services (like XySSL, <a href="http://xyssl.org/about/" class="external free" title="http://xyssl.org/about/" rel="nofollow">http://xyssl.org/about/</a>) is apparently OK. Tom, I would really appreciate you clarifying your selection of links to cull. As is, it simply looks like you have decided to delete all links to products that compete with the ones you work on at Elliptic. If this is indeed the case, I suggest a reversion. <a href="../../../d/i/m/User%7EDimawik_9386.html" title="User:Dimawik">Dimawik</a> 02:47, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If the link doesn't lead to something a reader can <b>freely</b> access (e.g. GPL, Public Domain, BSD) then it should be removed. XySSL gives the code out under a free license.

<dd>I suggest you actually read the guidelines yourself. Under "links normally to be avoided," rules #1, #3, and #4 clearly support the edits I performed. The IPcores (and other) commercial links were neither unique nor non-commercial in nature. There are FREELY available well documented AES implementations that would better serve the target audience than a proprietary CLOSED SOURCE link. think about it. What use is a proprietary link? Thy don't give out AES source code (C, HDL, Java, whatever). Their pages only mention they sell AES modules. Well big deal. Wikipedia is not an advertisers board.

<dd>Take no offense, I am not defending Dimawik or commercial links here.
