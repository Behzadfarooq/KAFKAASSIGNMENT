Hopefully? Hopefully as a sentence adverb is not shunned simply because some purists decided that it should rather be 'I am hopeful + relative clause'. There is more to it. To quote Eric Partridge: "<b>hopefully</b>, besides meaning 'in a hopeful way', now often means 'it is hoped'. This new use seems no odder than the corresponding use of adverbs such as <i>naturally</i>: ' Hopefully/Naturally she'll come', but it has aroused the rage of many purists. Those who do use it should at least beware of ambiguity, since 'He will leave tomorrow hopefully' might be interpreted in either way [This is, 'It is hoped (or indeed, I am hopeful) that he will leave tomorrow.', or 'He will leave tomorrow in a hopeful way.']." (Usage and Abusage: A Guide to Good English, Third Edition, 1999, Penguin Group, London)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The ambiguity exists for any sentence adverb. I am aware many purists use this example as an argument for avoiding this usage, but then we should avoid all sentence adverbs. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyborgTosser_1c56.html" title="User:CyborgTosser">CyborgTosser</a> 00:33, 13 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The myth of the "hopefully error" is one of the few things people think they know about adverbs. Granted, the following, which was just removed from the article, is a little strong:</dd>

</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>== "Hopefully" ==</dd>
<dd>The <i>hopefully</i> controversy is based on the theory that people should say <i>I am hopeful that...</i> instead of <i>hopefully</i> to start and modify a sentence. Yet, there are dozens of adverbs used in this way. Obviously this rule is illogical. So, *<b>Hopefully</b>, <i>grammarians won't trash hopefully as a sentence adverb anymore</i>.</dd>

<p>I was sitting around thinking about useless stuff, as usual, and I began to wonder what kind of adverb 'probably', 'possibly', and 'neccessarily' are. It seems to me that they are conditional adverbs, that is, they describe the conditions under which an action will take place. Another cool one may be 'stochastically', but I can see how this may describe in what manner something is done. 'Hopefully' seems conditional, but there's an extra twist of the speaker's desired outcome or result. Is there an "official" list of kinds of adverbs? Arguments for or against adding conditionals to the Groups of adverbs section?</p>

<p>Firstly, what does the NB mean? Nota bene?</p>
<p>Secondly, is there a list of irregular adverb construction adjectives, as <b>well</b> is for <b>good</b> (instead of <b>goodly</b>?). Thank you. --<a href="../../../a/b/d/User%7EAbdull_b6f2.html" title="User:Abdull">Abdull</a> 16:51, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>An adverb is a word that modifies a verb, an adjective, or another adverb. Some irregular [mostly, words that we don't recognize as adverbs] adverbs include: very, well, quite, before, usually, a lot, already, rather, really, more, now, not, why etc. It answers the questions: how, when, where, to what extent, or how often.</p>

<p>I don't understand how an adverb can modify an entire sentence. In the examples listed on the page, it appears (to me) that only the verb is being modified. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsopropyl_2165.html" title="User:Isopropyl">Isopropyl</a> 21:53, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I gather what is meant by modifying is that adverbs modify the meaning, i.e. express the way <b>how</b> something is done. E.g. if the adverb <i>quickly</i> is added to the sentence <i>He said...</i>, it modifies the meaning of the verb. --<a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebesta_2099.html" title="User:Sebesta">Sebesta</a> 22:00, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>However, adjectives can certainly be modified by adverbs as well, e.g. <i>extremely</i> good. --<a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebesta_2099.html" title="User:Sebesta">Sebesta</a> 22:02, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understand what an adverb is. I'm just curious as to (4) on the article page, which has the sentence
<dl>
<dd><i>Suddenly, the cat came in.</i></dd>

<dd>I don't understand why this is a sentence-modifying adverb. Isn't
<dl>
<dd><i>The cat came in suddenly</i></dd>
</dl>

<dd>equivalent in this case? Both sentences use "suddenly" to describe how the cat came in. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsopropyl_2165.html" title="User:Isopropyl">Isopropyl</a> 22:07, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Oh, now I see what you were talking about.&#160;:) I would say an adverb is used at the beginning of a sentence to emphasize (intensify) the meaning of the adverb; this position makes the adverb much more important in the sentence.</dd>
<dd>As for the example sentences you have cited—I don't think their meaning are necessarily equivalent.
<dl>
<dd><i>"The cat came in suddenly."</i> You would probably ask, <i>How did the cat come in?</i></dd>
<dd><i>"Suddenly, the cat came in."</i> I would feel more like, <i>Oh, what happened?</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>But I do agree that in some cases this difference could be insignificant or arguable.</dd>

<p>I recently came across a rather strange construction when I was reading a book that explained the usage of adverbs. The sentence was "... a really astronomical figure..." As far as I know, ttwo constructions would be possible: ".... a real astronomical figure..." or " really an astronomical figure.." My question is: which of the two is the correct one? Is it possible to use the first construction?</p>
<p>Teacher Adriano</p>
<dl>
<dd>I consider the very first one ("a really astronomical figure") correct. To make sure, I consulted the Merriam-Webster dictionary, and it gives this example for the "really" entry:</dd>
<dd><i>was a really beautiful morning</i></dd>
<dd>"real" is not an adverb in standard usage.</dd>
<dd>--<a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebesta_2099.html" title="User:Sebesta">Sebesta</a> 18:36, 6 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think he means a <i>real</i> astronomical figure, where "real" would be an adjective equivalent to "actual". Adriano, in the sense that <i>astronomical</i> means "large", the original sentence is correct in stating that it's "a really large figure". <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsopropyl_2165.html" title="User:Isopropyl">Isopropyl</a> 20:38, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is it possible to have one "-ly" adverb modifying another? For example, can we say: "The bus travelled fairly slowly."</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, in English "fairly slowly" is OK, as is "surprisingly quickly." Other adverbs are more picky, however, so for example, "extremely probably" is very clumsy, as well as "fairly luckily." In other languages, like Italian, adverbs ending in -mente can't be modified by other adverbs, if these also end in -mente. So in Italian, there is a big difference between "estremamente spesso" (`extremely often'), which is fine, because "spesso" doesn't end in -mente, and "estremamente frequenatmente" (`extremely frequently'), which is completely impossible. Nobody really knows how to characterize what's going on in English, but a rough rule would be that manner or frequency adverbs, like "often," "frequently," "quickly," etc. <i>can</i> be so modified, while <i>modal</i> adverbs, like "probably" etc. can't. Another test would be whether one can <i>question</i> the adverb with "how" as in <i>How frequently do you visit your mom?</i> This doesn't work at all with modal or evidential adverbs, e.g. "*how usually do you visit your mom?" or "*How probably will the Republicans win?" or "*How evidently is Bob a genius?" Again, nobody really knows why this is, but if you can get the feeling for which adverbs can be questioned in this way, then it's probably safer to abstain from modifying those that can't with an -ly adverb.</dd>

<p>I remember reading that the construction of adverbs in modern Romance languages (that is, adding -ment(e) to the end of the feminine adjective comes from a form or phrase in Greek (perhaps early medieval/late Koine) in which one combines the adjective with the word for "mind (ment/e from the Latin <i>mens</i>). Therefore to do something exactly is do something with and <i>exact mind</i>(exacta+mente). Is there any validity to this? I know this is not how adverbs were formed in Latin, but I do not speak any form of Greek, ancient or otherwise and it's been bugging me for a while. 201.21.96.49 19:15, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
