<dd>The old miner guy was used in their commercials and voice overs for awhile, but he's more of the spokesperson than mascot (but his voice is used in the Underground, and a characature of him is the "how tall to ride" sign for the Outlaw). I think I was told he left Iowa to persue an acting career or something (or maybe that's the voice of the Altoona Iowa casino?). I haven't seen/heard him in ads in awhile (and I do recall one year he had lost his beard which seemed odd). --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllenhuffman_3cbe.html" title="User:Allenhuffman">Allen Huffman</a> 21:01, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ever see a cat run? Now, on a side note, there is Bernie the Dog, which has been the mascot for ages, and there was Toby the Tiger (who I saw this past Sunday) as a walkaround character. Toby and Bernie were hanging out together with a handler. I'm not sure who Toby is, though, but I will add a mascot section when I get the info. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllenhuffman_3cbe.html" title="User:Allenhuffman">Allen Huffman</a> 22:13, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay, it gets more confusing. I've now found three walkaround characters (not counting Garflied) that have been in the parks in the past few years!

<p>There is conflicting information (both here, and elsewhere on the web) whether or not the Sky ride is still in operation or not (and Adventureland's own website isn't very good with details on rides). Can someone confirm this (Haven't been to the park in a few years)? If it closed, can anyone find info on a reason?

<p>The Chapel (church) was added a few years ago (I'll have to check my photos for the actual date) and is used as a performance area for gospel groups and also some canned (singing to tape) shows using the same cast as Sodas and Sounds.

<p>I understand grouping rides by kid rides, coasters, and others (categories) but we also talk about park sections which makes me want to group rides by park sections, or at least do something like list a section, then a list of names of rides/shows in that section, then have a different section that goes in to more detail about the actual rides (descriptions, etc.).

<dd>You go to the "upload file" link (on the right) and upload your file. It will ask you for some information. Since you are the creator of the images, it's relatively straightforward (just choose either "free licence" or "public domain"), and the naming, within reason, is pretty flexible (for example, a picture of The Dragon might be "The_Dragon.jpg" or "DragonAtAdventureland.gif").</dd>

<p>The text currently says that there are only 2 rides in Outlaw Gulch (the Outlaw and Sawmill Splash). Isn't there also a couple of small kiddie rides as well? I seem to remember that the Chuck Wagons are there... Nice work with the trivia, etc. by the way! --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_fischer_fdad.html" title="User:Tim fischer">Rehcsif</a> 16:17, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh drats. I guess that depends on where Outlaw Gulch starts. Indeed, once you pass under the sign leading the way, there is the Puff the Dragons pin wide, and the Chuck Wagon for kids. To me, the dragon ride always seemed to fit with "Dragon Island" but the Chuck Wagon certainly fits better with Outlaw Gulch. Hrm. If only they outlined the areas on the park map. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllenhuffman_3cbe.html" title="User:Allenhuffman">Allen Huffman</a></dd>

<dd>I may have time to look at it later this week. Otherwise, check out rcdb.com -- they have stats for most coasters.

<dd>While we're at it, <i>The Dragon</i> page could use some expansion. I started it based on Fisher's <i>Tornado</i> article, but it still needs more stuff.

<p>I started a new section. Would it be okay to also move the extinct coasters down there? I guess we could sub-categorize the extict attractions by type, too. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllenhuffman_3cbe.html" title="User:Allenhuffman">Allen Huffman</a></p>

<dd>Yeah, we should move the extinct coasters there. Also, my memory is a little fuzzy, but wasn't there once a carousel in the Riverview (now Dragon Island) area? I also mentioned the Haunted House and Mirror attraction in the Riverplace trivia item I added yesterday... Also, I see you mentioned the Scrambler was replaced by Sawmill Splash. I've only been to A-land once in the past 5 years (we used to go several times a summer in the 80's and late 70's), but isn't Sawmill Splash in the rear of the park, past the Outlaw, wheras the scrambler was more toward the front/middle of the park near the Balloon Race? --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_fischer_fdad.html" title="User:Tim fischer">Rehcsif</a> 16:10, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, there was a carousel near The Dragon which is now a Hymalaya. I am told the other edge, which has games under it, was the location of either a Himalaya (in the past) or the Scrambler (before it was moved in to Outlaw Gulch). So yes, there was a carousel (I have pics and remember seeing it when I moved to Iowa in 1995) but I don't know about the former Himalaya. Or even how to correctly spell it&#160;;-) I was also told that the Falling Star used to be called The Rainbow. A friend has a video tape from cartoons in the 80s that shows it, so I'll have to borrow it and check it out to verify. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllenhuffman_3cbe.html" title="User:Allenhuffman">Allen Huffman</a></dd>

<p>The Lighthouse was not operating a few weeks ago, and now is dissasembled. It was unclear if they had it down for rehab, or are gutting it. It looked gutted yesterday, so it may be destined for the list soon. Also, Galleon hasn't been running any of my visits this year. (Oddly, the carousel was shut off yesterday too, but I can't see that one going away.) --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllenhuffman_3cbe.html" title="User:Allenhuffman">Allen Huffman</a> 23:51, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Lighthouse (although I had no idea that's what it was called until recently) always scared me even as a kid in the early 80's -- seemed like an old ride. I wonder if that came to Adventureland from anothe park? I'd be sad to see Galleon go -- I remember when they added that one. Incidently -- Allen have you seen the question I left you on your talk page regarding photos? --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_fischer_fdad.html" title="User:Tim fischer">Rehcsif</a> 02:14, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I question the wording about the Underground being the major attraction of the area. The Underground opened many years before Space Shot, with SS being the big new ride. I'd think it became the major attraction of the area. (That said, I'm not sure where all these land definitions come from.) Comments? --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllenhuffman_3cbe.html" title="User:Allenhuffman">Allen Huffman</a></p>

<dd>I wondered about that too. I've only been to the park once since both of these rides existed, but I would say that neither is really a "standout" and that the particular area of the park isn't quite as themed/sectioned as the others, like "County Fair" or "Outlaw Gulch". Another thing -- isn't part of "The Boulevard" really part of "Bavaria"? I thought that's why they had "Der Flinger" and formerly "Der Flitzer" there (Der Flitzer sat where the Giant Skywheel is now, which the article currently calls "The Boulevard". --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_fischer_fdad.html" title="User:Tim fischer">Rehcsif</a> 18:37, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
