<p>Under the section 2.2 (Z-Tokens, under Guardianship) it is stated that Z-tokens can be traded for in game currency. I have scoured AQ's webpage, and have found no evidence of this... Is this true, or a mistake?</p>
<dl>
<dd>True only by a roundabout route - You can buy something with Z-tokens, and then sell it for gold, to convert between them.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Namegduf Live (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Namegduf_Live_2b1e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Namegduf Live">contribs</a>) 21:46, January 25, 2007 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p>battleon/adventure quest has its own page, with artix entertainment as the producer, is it not correct to introduce dragonfable its own page, i imagine that it is the game the designers dreamed of making, but due to the limiting nature of AQ were not able to, i can see it becoming a popular game, therefore requiring its own page.</p>

<dd>For its repeated failures, making a DragonFable page has been protected, and you must contact an admin in order to recreate a page for it. With this in mind, I suggest that if you should want to remake the DF page on Wikipedia, then the best way would be to write up an interesting, informative, non-bias, and professional looking article to achieve the best results. An article like that would certainly convince an admin to allow it to be made. However, anything that is spammy, fancrufty, or overall uninformative would only increase an admin's trust in protecting a DF page from being made. <a href="../../../s/n/u/User%7ESnufStyle420_61fd.html" title="User:SnufStyle420">SnufStyle420</a> 22:03, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Writing an article that meets <a href="../../../s/n/u/User%7ESnufStyle420_61fd.html" title="User:SnufStyle420">SnufStyle420's</a> criteria is indeed the best course at this point. It is important that notability of the game be established as well as the previous deletions have largely been concerned with the relative non-notability of DragonFable in relation to other Games. It definitely seems to have a good page count on google and Alexa now so if written well and argued correctly can be quite effective. You will then either need to request an administrator unprotect the page or post a deletion review arguing from the presepective of new information, rather then any out of process problems. This tendency of late to indefinitely or infinitely protect pages after multiple recreations seems pretty antithetical to Wikipedia policy to me but it can be worked within.

<p>This article is in serious need of a rewrite and cleanup.</p>
<p>As a new member of the Computer and Video Games WikiProject, improving this article will be my first task. Besides helping with the rewrite and cleanup, to ensure information is better organized, I will be adding in-game screenshots. For an example, see an article I wrote, <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_Groups_5145.html" title="Google Groups">Google Groups</a>. This in-game screenshots will help readers see how the game is played, and will possibly verify some of the information in the article.</p>
<p>However, as a level 58 non-Guardian, I quit AdventureQuest several months ago due to the Guardian Only Login. AdventureQuest recently introduced a survey that, after taking, will allow a non-Guardian unrestricted login access for 24 hours.</p>
<p>Therefore, all I need is someone to give me the "green light". In addition, I would appreciate any advice you have for me, regarding the very major edit that I will make during a weekend (probably tomorrow), that will take several hours for me.</p>

<p>There is a highly Innaproprriate statement at the beginning of the article. It directly criticises the game in an oppinion manner. to people who play the game and enjoy it, this is highly offensive. It is the result of a fight betwenn hones patrons of the game and fans of other online games, who notoriously enter forums dedicated for the use of said patrons and proceed to incite arguements by incessently insulting the game. i must request that this comment be removed promptly.</p>
<p><br />
I do not see why you bothered to make this request when you promptly removed it yourself. On another note, this kind of vandalism is present on most game articles on Wikipedia. It is quite common unfortunately, as negative opinions are often expressed through Wikipedia. As you probably figured out allready, there is a better way for this kind of content to be removed other than asking someone else to do it for you. The only reasons I believe that is supported to bring up the topic of others helping edit the article would be that of mass, necessary edits to benefit the page, or uncertain changes that need discussion as to its use for the article. Since you concluded easrlier what kind of change was being called for, I believe it is obvious where this topic falls into. <a href="../../../s/n/u/User%7ESnufStyle420_61fd.html" title="User:SnufStyle420">SnufStyle420</a> 12:49, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

My primary reason for posting the request was in hopes that people would leave the edit be. last time i corrected a page, Namely the C++ page and the sample code in it, the change was deleted within a day, despite being entirely valid and fixing a peice of code that would not have opperated given the syntax that was presented. however, once i posted a request to maintain the change, it endured</p>

<p>The Runescape article, now almost devoid of negtive critisism, is locked due to vandelism, while this artcle, which has half of it devoted to putting the game down and is constently being vandelised, is. Wikipedia isn't looking so non-biased from my angle..<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.192.188.142 (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.192.188.142.html" title="User talk:68.192.188.142">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.192.188.142_9007.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.192.188.142">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>Quite frankly, this article does have a lot of vandalism, deletions, and complete wipe outs of the whole page at an almost weekly rate. I would be glad if the article was locked to avoid further acts of vandalism. However, semi-protection is regarded as a sort of last resort, in the case that vandalism is too hard to keep up with or blocked/banned users use multiple IP adresses or accounts to continue smearing a page to bypass the inability to edit pages. In my opinion, vandalism here is not to the point that it is difficult to keep up with. Blocking individual vandals and reverting edits is a much better option than restricting edits by anonymous individuals or newly signed up users. Should you truly wish that the page be semi-protected, you may request for it <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_page_protection_b2ec.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for page protection">here</a>. Now then, as for the page being not so non-bias, as far as I can tell, everything on this page is fact according to ingame content and information gathered from around the main site and forums. Should more of it come off as fact that shows a darker side, that only means that there are more facts shown here that seem darker than light. Should more facts be presented that put the article on a lighter note by noting lighter sides of the article, than perhaps this page might not come off as so negative to you. However, it remains that this issue is not in need of semi-protection in my opinion, for vandalism or otherwise. <a href="../../../s/n/u/User%7ESnufStyle420_61fd.html" title="User:SnufStyle420">SnufStyle420</a> 21:28, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Recruiting help from the Artix Entertainment forums might be helpful, but please remember to specify that we only want helpful and useful edits. Since one of your goals is to get rid of the fancruft on the page, it would be very disturbing to see this backfire and have more and more people come to try and help by adding in nonsense. As for the reconstruction so far, I am targeting on the NPC section next for clean up. Personally, I don't think it should even be there, but as long as there is "fancruft" and the people who make it, that section will probably stay up, so a little snipping will help trim it down to a size more suitable. <a href="../../../s/n/u/User%7ESnufStyle420_61fd.html" title="User:SnufStyle420">SnufStyle420</a> 19:21, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you for such a warm welcome. I'm glad to meet you both, J.L.W.S The Special One and SnuffStyle420. You guys can call me Mystic if you wish. Though not completly such what fancruft is, I have a general idea of what it is. As for the forums, I guess a section is all that's needed. A page, most likely, would be too much for such an article. And I assume that an encyclopediac manner would be non-biased informative writing? I think I can accomplish that. In the forums section we must remember to include each main category such as Lagends and Lore, Community, and Game Talk(Adventure Quest, DragonFable, ArchKnight, and Minigames). Though, We don't really need a full discussion on each, right? I think this is a perfect place to discuss editing the page. Maybe we could create something of a 'council' or something of the sort to keep track of who is helping and what they intend to do. *<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysticEndevor_233b.html" title="User:MysticEndevor">MysticEndevor</a>*</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think a section about the forums would be adequate. Fancruft is information that would be useful only to fans, and not to those who are unfamiliar with AdventureQuest and simply wish to learn more about the game. Encyclopediac writing is difficult to define, and writing in an encyclopediac manner requires practice and a good command of English. I suggest you read some featured articles to get an idea of encyclopediac writing. Some tips for encyclopediac writing: stay fancruft-free, unbiased, formal and concise. I hope you enjoy being a Wikipedian and we can become Wikifriends! --<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHildanknight_74fc.html" title="User:Hildanknight">J.L.W.S.

<p>First things first, it's only one "f". Second things second, I don't see much rush for a section about the forums. The community is filled with a very biased group, whom most of which are in need of a dictionary or spell check system in an obvious manner. As noted in the thread Hildanknight made, the extreme majority of people who play are 13 to 17 years old. Not to discriminate against younger people, but this age average helps to explain the content of a vast portion there. In short, I fail to invision an interesting section written about the forums or the community. Third things third, I don't think there is much need for a link to the forums, as there is one right on the AQ homepage linked from here, until this section about the community is created. The external links should be more so for people to find out more about what they are reading, rather than just link spam like I've had to take out a few times. I don't even think that "LORE" link has barely enough credibility to stay there. Fourth things fourth, I believe the Z-Tokens section needs some attention as well. It crunches out numbers too much, and makes it seem like it was copied straight from the page you pay for them at. Maybe it could be turned into a general section about what people can pay for and what they get, leaving out all the specifics about what you get for how much money on different levels. I believe that is all for now.

<p>I'm not sure exactly what kind of biasedness you mean. Would you elaborate a little more, please? Still, everyone has some biased in them about something. However, wether or not they show it is another story. Most people on the forums do show high biased tendancies, but it should not be a complete relction on the forums itself. If you cannot invision a quality section about the forums, let me handle it and we'll see what I can come up with. If it is disagreeable, I will change it. If it is completely useless, I will discard it. And, you're right, the link was not needed, but if it's because there is a link on the AQ home page, I can show you three links on the same page that link to DragonFable. So should you take that off too? As for the Z-Tokens, I too think it should be general information and not needless details.--<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysticEndevor_233b.html" title="User:MysticEndevor">MysticEndevor</a> 20:22, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>There, I polished up the Z-Token section a bit. What do you think? I don't think Zorbak needs that much information. He is, afterall, only a minor charactor used mainly for comic relief.--<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysticEndevor_233b.html" title="User:MysticEndevor">MysticEndevor</a> 20:30, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Quite frankly, the majority of the people on the AQ forums are Guardians. This, unfortunately, fills most of the place up with bias posts against free players, posts asking and begging for bigger and better stuff no matter what was developed previously, and an overall sense that since they paid that they have every priority over free members in every category, not just matters relating to AQ. Now, not all Guardians are like this, which is a good thing, however more of those people should express their opinions for an open air group to be formed rather than a stereotype that keeps on repeating along each and every post count. As for the DF link, I would rather much remove it, but since there is still a section about DF on this page, it should probably be left. Once a section about the community or forums is made, then I believe it would be helpful to make a link to them. See above. And yes, I saw your edit. It did clean up the section quite a bit. However, I feel that having a section for Z-Tokens puts too much spotlight on it. It's just like making a section about Gold and what players can buy with it or what mosnters drop how much. Perhaps if it was just turned into a more general section about all in game benefits through payment, then it would be a more useful area. <a href="../../../s/n/u/User%7ESnufStyle420_61fd.html" title="User:SnufStyle420">SnufStyle420</a> 03:37, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Indeed, I have tried to make things more even on the forums and In game (though staff never listens to me) and if you want i'll try and do the same thing here. I have done thing rangeing from suggestions to Posts on the KoO boards. I feel that guardians like myself should be careing and help adventuers as much as possible. i mean we were them once right?<a href="../../../l/e/g/User%7ELego3400_2859.html" title="User:Lego3400">Lego3400: The Sage of Time</a> 16:11, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Unfortunatly, I won't be helping much, afterall, with this board or any other. I'm sorry, but I have to focus my attention to else things in life. I hope you all do well. MysticEndevor</p>
<p>I do beleive that a section should be put in about lore, because it is the entire concept that AQ revolves around. it is really the history of the AQ world and often decides on future events based on past events,also hinted at by the aq staff are answers to questions frequently brought about on the forums. as for a section on the forums, since it is not entirely about adventure quest, should be put somewhere else, mabey the artix entertainment article. If anyone decides to put in something on lore,(it could possibly be extensive,because of its nature)they should contact falerin, the main ... person on knowledge from/about lore. you could contact him on the forums,throug e-mail or PM. i hope this is taken into consideration.Relyks 22:31, 27 March 2007 (UTC)-Relyks</p>

<p>X-Guardianship being put in controversy and criticism? I know it can simply be moved but something is not right here. 211.29.164.148 12:04, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>To put it simply, because it is a very controversial deal. If you read carefully, you will see that there is very little gained from that feature. Also, should you read the beginning paragraph in the section, it states that Guardians still have to pay for it, dispite being told they would have access to everything put in for players. It has been critisized many times by players for its lack of useful features and restriction on paying players without it. Players paying real money for very little and argueably useless features while adding in stuff that paying players cannot access even though they paid for access to everything sounds pretty controversial. You are right though, it could be simply moved, but it is displayed there for the purposes stated above. We are currently working on expanding the Z-Tokens section to cover everything gained from paying AQ, but until then, X-Guardianship will be only mentioned where it is at right now. <a href="../../../s/n/u/User%7ESnufStyle420_61fd.html" title="User:SnufStyle420">SnufStyle420</a> 16:22, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>But that's beside's the point. Re-listing the features is redundent and pointless. List the criticism, not the same thing stated a page-view above about the upgrade. --24.239.66.162 04:16, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm currently re-writing the article, and I will eventually add a section about Guardianship. The Guardianship section will have sections about X-Guardianship and Z-Tokens, while information about the controversy surrounding them will remain in the Criticism section.

<p>Has Artix ever released statistics on this matter? It would be interesting to see of how many players are actually Guardians and it could provide evidence for the statement that many see the original as a "free demo." <a href="../../../y/t/g/User%7EYtgy111_682a.html" title="User:Ytgy111">Taylor</a> 06:52, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>There have been multiple times over the years that AQ staff and moderators have seen questions partaining to the server cap and why Guardians logged in are counted towards that. In every one of them, the make mention that about 80-90% of the players logged in at any given time are free accounts. The staff also encourages creating another account when free accounts are used up with free logins. Given this information, it would be very hard to get exact data on free accounts/users/Guardian accounts. Given that any person could have used over 100 accounts by themselves just trying to play the game freely could adjust any statistic over time as data is collected. It can also be hard to get pure results as the 80-90% of free users logged in could haver a different view. However, the general expression held by free players on AQ's own forums and surrounding online RPG's and other online communities is constant with the current revision on this page. Should you wish to find evidence that contrasts the statement, by all means, go ahead. But, I think the only stats you will find will back up everything in the article as it stands. <a href="../../../s/n/u/User%7ESnufStyle420_61fd.html" title="User:SnufStyle420">SnufStyle420</a> 16:01, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I beleive the staff do a cleanup on accounts once or twice a year. I do not know the last date of cleanup,however, and hope to pursue the matter further.~Rel</p>

<p>That wasn't vandalism, it was just phrased incorectly. From The Artix Entertainment article: "Artix Entertainment, LLC is a game development company that specializes in creating online browser-based computer role-playing games written for Macromedia Flash. The company was founded by Adam Bohn and Tony Deller, and is based in Land O' Lakes, Florida, in the United States." If that was put in, it was probably stating that artix entertainment is based in Land o' Lakes florida. If so, it may be anption to include that in the article. ~Rel</p>
