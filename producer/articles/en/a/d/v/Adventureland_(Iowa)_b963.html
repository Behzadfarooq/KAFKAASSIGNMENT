<p>Much like <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disneyland.html" title="Disneyland">Disneyland</a>, Adventureland is divided into several different themed areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Main Street</b>, which resembles a stereotypical turn-of-the-20th-century town square, is the first area visitors encounter upon entering the park. The principal attractions of this area are the A-Train, a small-scale locomotive which winds around one side of the park, and an antique-style carousel in the middle of the Town Square. Main Street also contains several gift shops, restaurants, an arcade, and other service-type establishments.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>County Fair</b> is a rural-themed area whose principal attraction is "<a href="../../../t/o/r/Tornado_%28roller_coaster%29.html" title="Tornado (roller coaster)">The Tornado</a>", a large wooden roller coaster, as well as many fair-themed games of skill. <b>Iowa Farm</b> follows a similar theme (look for the big pig in the "Iowa Farm" section of the park; it's actually a small concession stand).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Dragon Island</b>, near the rear of the park, originally was built as <i>Riverview</i> in 1979, and contained a number of attractions from the Riverview Park amusement center that had recently closed in nearby Des Monies. In 1991, the area was renamed <i>Dragon Island</i> when the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dragon_%28roller_coaster%29_5ab3.html" title="The Dragon (roller coaster)">Dragon</a> roller coaster was opened.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Outlaw Gulch</b>, constructed in 1993, has an Old West theme, complete with a "ghost town." The attractions in this part of the park are "<a href="../../../o/u/t/Outlaw_%28roller_coaster%29.html" title="Outlaw (roller coaster)">The Outlaw</a>" (a large wooden roller coaster), the "Chuckwagon" (a small western-themed <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferris_Wheel_8f6e.html" title="Ferris Wheel">Ferris Wheel</a>), the "Sidewinder" (a swinging pendulum ride that swings riders over 180 degrees while spinning them around the pole the seats sit around), and "Saw Mill Splash," a water ride. The Royal Hanneford Circus is also nearby. In the first few years of operation, a cowboy themed comedy show was held in front of the ghost town facade, but it was later removed and the shooting gallery was installed there. The food location also changed from a walk in drink and snack bar to a front counter serving hamburgers and other foods. Other food in the section is a Kettle Corn stand and a Dippin Dots ice cream cart.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Space Shot Midway</b> is built around the "Space Shot" ride. However, the major attraction is now "The Underground", a ride which incorporates elements of both a <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_ride.html" title="Dark ride">dark ride</a> and a roller coaster. The "Dodge-Em Cars" and numerous kid's rides are also nearby.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Bavaria</b> is a German-themed area. The "Sky Ride" is the major attraction in this area of the park and includes the <i>Rathskellar</i> concession stand and Alpine arcade area.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>River City</b> is built around the "Raging River" ride, and may have been influenced by the "River City" in the <a href="../../../m/e/r/Meredith_Willson_6150.html" title="Meredith Willson">Meredith Willson</a> musical, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Music_Man_2e27.html" title="The Music Man">The Music Man</a></i> Several food stands sit in this section of the park as well.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>The Boulevard</b> has several major rides, but the biggest is the "Giant Skywheel", the largest open-gondola <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferris_wheel.html" title="Ferris wheel">Ferris wheel</a> built in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> since the 1800s.</li>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/v/Adventureland_%28Iowa%29_b963.html" title="Edit section: Trivia">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Trivia</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>The park contains many design nods inspired by <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disneyland.html" title="Disneyland">Disneyland</a>. The entrance has a train station with two tunnels (on the left- and right-hand side) leading in to the <b>Main Street</b> area, just like at Disneyland or <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walt_Disney_World_4f0c.html" title="Walt Disney World">Walt Disney World</a>'s Magic Kingdom (and also similar to many other parks built since Disneyland opened in 1955). Over in <b>Outlaw Gulch</b>, there are several tombstones that have virtually the same wording as tombstones outside of Walt Disney World's Haunted Mansion attraction. The rocking pirate ship has even played a soundtrack that included splashing water and an excerpt from the "<a href="../../../p/i/r/Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_597d.html" title="Pirates of the Caribbean">Pirates of the Caribbean</a>" theme song, "Yo Ho." Interestingly enough, "Adventureland" is actually a theme area of its own at Disneyland.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There are many other similarities to Disneyland though they are most likely just things that have become standard and common for amusement centers over the year (such as the similarity between Sheriff Sam's Saloon at Adventureland and the Golden Horseshoe Saloon at Disney). There is also a gift shop on the corner of Main Street called the Emporium.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Shooting Gallery in Outlaw Gulch is a replacement for a former shooting gallery located near Sheriff Sam's Saloon. The gallery operates on light sensitive photo sensors, which means a camera flash will set off every element. Gallery workers also note that, during rainy days, lightning will also have the same effect.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The "dress up" old time photo shop on Main Street has been in the park since the 1970s.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Several merchants on Main Street, such as the sign maker and airbrush shop, are not Adventureland employees. They lease the location and operate their business during the season. (This is similar to many of the crafter shops at <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knott%27s_Berry_Farm_db94.html" title="Knott's Berry Farm">Knott's Berry Farm</a> in <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Beer and wine coolers are sold in the park and the liquor license allows them to be carried around. The one exception to this is opening weekend, which is a "Say No To Drugs" weekend and the park does not sell alcohol during that event.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>On Main Street, there is a theater (currently used for corporate events) with a ticket taker window. Inside that window is an animatronic figure that is reprogrammed each year to repeat spiels about new attractions in the park.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>During its brief few years of operation, The Mixer was sponsored by a bread company.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Dragon Island</b> was formerly known as <b>Riverview</b>. This area was added to the park in 1979, after Adventureland bought out the old Riverview Park amusement park in nearby Des Moines. The original attractions in this area, including games of skill, a Haunted House attraction, and a Hall of Mirrors, were moved in from Riverview. When <i>The Dragon</i> was added in 1991, the area was renamed Dragon Island. The loading station area for The Dragon occupies the space (and part of the actual building) where the Haunted House and Hall of Mirrors was (and a few mirrors can still be seen in the ride exit area).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Adventureland Park did not have a website until just a few years ago because, according to a marketing director, the owner didn't want one. Eventually a website was launched under the domain name adventureland-usa.com because adventurelandpark.com had already been registered by someone who was supposed to be working on a site for them. Eventually Adventureland was able to obtain and use the now-promoted adventurelandpark.com domain.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The first year season passes were offered, they did not include parking.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A few weeks after opening in 2006, a tree trunk near the Underground was carved into a giraffe. At the base was the name "Jack." Adventureland was founded by Jack Krantz.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Guests that arrive early in the morning or between 2 and 3 p.m. (after the PM shift change) and pay for their parking often receive dollar coins as part of their change instead of $1 bills. This is because the starting banks for the parking lot sellers do not include one dollar bills, but only dollar coins.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The water on the Splash Over is often deliberately turned off or kept on a low setting if the wind is blowing from east to west; this is done so that guests walking past on the Boulevard are not soaked along with the riders.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Park workers state that corporate days (such as Pella Windows) can bring as many as 10,000 to the park. Some companies will request alcohol not to be served during their large corporate outings.</li>

<p>The park's official mascot is "Bernie Benard," a dog. A cartoon drawing of Bernie appears on park guides and maps, and a walk-around character poses for photos in the park. Another character, "Toby" the tiger, also walks around the park. According to Adventureland's PR department, "Toby the tiger has been around about as long as Bernie, but is not in our ads, so he might not be as recognizable." A third dog character, Henry, is also seen in the park.</p>
<p>For a special promotion in 2001, <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garfield.html" title="Garfield">Garfield</a> the cat appeared in the park with a special photo opportunity on Main Street.</p>
<p>An actor who plays an old west miner type character appeared for many years in TV commercials, and his voice is heard in The Underground narration (and voice of the old miner animatronic in the pre-show). A cartoon caricature of him appears as the "must be this tall to ride" sign outside of The Outlaw.</p>
<p>In 2005, a "girl in a cage being carried by a gorilla" effect character was also seen to roam the park.</p>
<p>At the ticket window of the main street theater, an animatronic character named P.T. Barnaby spiels about park happenings each year.</p>
