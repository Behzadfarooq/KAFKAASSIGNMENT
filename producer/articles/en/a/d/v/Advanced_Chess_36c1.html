<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/v/Advanced_Chess_36c1.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The concept of computer-assisted chess tournaments originated in <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction.html" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a>, notably in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Peace_War_92a3.html" title="The Peace War">The Peace War</a></i> written by <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vernor_Vinge_e3b7.html" title="Vernor Vinge">Vernor Vinge</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>.</p>
<p>The former world champion <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Grandmaster_2339.html" title="International Grandmaster">grandmaster</a> <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garry_Kasparov_1370.html" title="Garry Kasparov">Garry Kasparov</a>, who retired from competitive chess in 2005 but is still considered by many the strongest <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess.html" title="Chess">chess</a> <a href="../../../p/l/a/Player_%28game%29.html" title="Player (game)">player</a> in the world, has a long history in playing "Man vs. Machine" events. Among the most important are his matches against <a href="../../../i/b/m/IBM_cbf4.html" title="IBM">IBM</a>'s research <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer.html" title="Computer">computer</a> <a href="../../../d/e/e/Deep_Blue_9ae9.html" title="Deep Blue">Deep Blue</a>, which Kasparov defeated in February 1996, scoring 4-2 in a 6-game match, and lost to, 3.5-2.5, in a May 1997 rematch. <a href="../../../d/e/e/Deep_Blue_-_Kasparov%2C_1996%2C_Game_1_72bf.html" title="Deep Blue - Kasparov, 1996, Game 1">The first game</a> of the former match remained famous though, as it was the first game in the history of chess in which a <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Chess_Championship_2131.html" title="World Chess Championship">world champion</a> had been defeated by a computer. Though the Deep Blue computer is now defunct, IBM still maintains the <a href="../../../w/e/b/Website.html" title="Website">website</a> for it and the associated famous match at <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/deepblue/" class="external text" title="http://www.research.ibm.com/deepblue/" rel="nofollow">www.research.ibm.com/deepblue</a>. After this spectacular match, and many other matches against computers, Garry Kasparov came to an idea to invent a new form of chess in which humans and computers <a href="../../../c/o/-/Co-operation.html" title="Co-operation">co-operate</a>, instead of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competition.html" title="Competition">contending</a> with each other. Kasparov named this form of chess "Advanced Chess".</p>
<p>The first Advanced Chess event was held in June 1998 in <a href="../../../l/e/%C3%B3/Le%C3%B3n%2C_Le%C3%B3n_41c8.html" title="León, León">León</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a>. It was played between <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garry_Kasparov_1370.html" title="Garry Kasparov">Garry Kasparov</a>, who was using <a href="../../../f/r/i/Fritz_%28chess%29.html" title="Fritz (chess)">Fritz</a> 5, and <a href="../../../v/e/s/Veselin_Topalov_ffb5.html" title="Veselin Topalov">Veselin Topalov</a>, who was using <a href="../../../c/h/e/ChessBase_ebc6.html" title="ChessBase">ChessBase</a> 7.0. The analytical engines used, such as <a href="../../../f/r/i/Fritz_%28chess%29.html" title="Fritz (chess)">Fritz</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/a/HIARCS_d49b.html" title="HIARCS">HIARCS</a> and <a href="../../../j/u/n/Junior_%28chess%29.html" title="Junior (chess)">Junior</a>, were integrated into these two programs, and could have been called at a click of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_mouse.html" title="Computer mouse">mouse</a>. It was a 6-game match, and it was arranged in advance that the players would consult the built-in million games <a href="../../../d/a/t/Database.html" title="Database">databases</a> only for the 3rd and 4th game, and would only use analytical engines without consulting the databases for the remaining games. The time available to each player during the games was 60 minutes. The match ended in a 3-3 <a href="../../../t/i/e/Tie_%28draw%29.html" title="Tie (draw)">tie</a>. After the match, Kasparov said:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"My prediction seems to be true that in Advanced Chess it's all over once someone gets a won position. This experiment was exciting and helped spectators understand what's going on. It was quite enjoyable and will take a very big and prestigious place in the history of chess."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Regular Advanced Chess events have been held since in <a href="../../../l/e/%C3%B3/Le%C3%B3n%2C_Le%C3%B3n_41c8.html" title="León, León">León</a> each year, with a little inconsistency after 2002.

After the loss to Kramnik, Anand said:</p>

<dd><i>"I think in general people tend to overestimate the importance of the computer in the competitions. You can do a lot of things with the computer but you still have to play good chess. I more or less manage to do so except for this third game. In such a short match, against a very solid and hard to beat opponent, this turned out to be too much but I don’t really feel like that the computer alone can change the objective true to the position."</i></dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/v/Advanced_Chess_36c1.html" title="Edit section: Advanced Chess strengths">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Advanced Chess strengths</span></h2>
<p>It has been stressed that the strength of an Advanced Chess player does not come from any of the components of the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human.html" title="Human">human</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer.html" title="Computer">computer</a> team, but rather from the <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symbiosis.html" title="Symbiosis">symbiosis</a> of the two. This means that, even if a <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human.html" title="Human">human</a> <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess.html" title="Chess">chess</a> <a href="../../../p/l/a/Player_%28game%29.html" title="Player (game)">player</a> is stronger than the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_program.html" title="Computer program">computer program</a> he is using, he will be able to increase his playing strength even further with good Advanced Chess play, and likewise, if a human player is weaker than the computer program he is using, he will still be able to play with a strength that is even greater than that of the computer. The strength of an Advanced Chess player lies in the combination of the computer's tactical <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accuracy.html" title="Accuracy">accuracy</a> and the human's <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creativity.html" title="Creativity">creativity</a> and sagacity, provided that both team components do possess these qualities.</p>
<p>The individual strengths of a computer chess program lie in:</p>
<ul>
<li>being able to <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calculate.html" title="Calculate">calculate</a> at a fascinating speed - on an average <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_Computer_cdd7.html" title="Personal Computer">PC</a> of today, a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_chess.html" title="Computer chess">chess program</a> is able to calculate a few million positions per second, making it tactically superior to any <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human.html" title="Human">human</a> in complex <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess_tactics.html" title="Chess tactics">tactical</a> positions;</li>
<li>having access to a <a href="../../../d/a/t/Database.html" title="Database">database</a> of millions of tried and thoroughly tested <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess_opening.html" title="Chess opening">opening</a> moves and variations, with the ability to <a href="../../../i/n/f/Information_retrieval.html" title="Information retrieval">retrieve information</a> from such a database very quickly, and to store such a database on <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardware.html" title="Hardware">hardware</a> resources available to most modern PCs;</li>
<li>having built-in <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endgame_tablebase.html" title="Endgame tablebase">tablebases</a> for <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endgame.html" title="Endgame">endgames</a>, allowing the program to play perfect chess in certain endgames.</li>
</ul>
<p>The individual strengths of a human chess player lie in:</p>
<ul>
<li>the intuitive ability to construct meaningful long-term <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess_strategy.html" title="Chess strategy">strategic</a> plans which even the fastest <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_Computer_cdd7.html" title="Personal Computer">PCs</a> cannot foresee;</li>
<li>being able to quickly discriminate meaningful moves from the meaningless, without wasting time on deeply calculating the combinations which can be deemed meaningless at first sight;</li>
<li>being able to critically judge and analyze a chess <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess.html" title="Chess">game</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess_terminology.html#P" title="Chess terminology">plan</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess_opening.html" title="Chess opening">opening</a> or <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endgame.html" title="Endgame">endgame</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_program.html" title="Computer program">computer program</a> is <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess_tactics.html" title="Chess tactics">tactically</a> superior, whereas a <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human.html" title="Human">human</a> <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess.html" title="Chess">chess</a> <a href="../../../p/l/a/Player_%28game%29.html" title="Player (game)">player</a> is <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess_strategy.html" title="Chess strategy">strategically</a> superior, making the combination of the two a completely superior chess player. However it is entirely possible for the computer to become strategically superior, and recently <a href="../../../r/y/b/Rybka.html" title="Rybka">Rybka</a> has outperformed other chess engines by large margins because of its programmed chess knowledge.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/v/Advanced_Chess_36c1.html" title="Edit section: How it is played">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">How it is played</span></h2>
<p>Both players sit in a typical <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess.html" title="Chess">chess</a>-playing room, equipped with fast PCs of equal <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardware.html" title="Hardware">hardware</a> strength. It is the duty of the <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tournament.html" title="Tournament">tournament</a> organizers to make sure that the players are familiar with the pertinent <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardware.html" title="Hardware">hardware</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/f/Software.html" title="Software">software</a>. Unlike the traditional face-to-face <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess.html" title="Chess">chess</a>, the players usually face their respective <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer.html" title="Computer">computers</a>. Each player is typically allotted one hour of thinking time (as was the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_control.html" title="Time control">time control</a> used in all Advanced Chess events in <a href="../../../l/e/%C3%B3/Le%C3%B3n%2C_Le%C3%B3n_41c8.html" title="León, León">León</a>), though the particular <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tournament.html" title="Tournament">tournament</a> <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regulations.html" title="Regulations">regulations</a> may vary regarding this matter.</p>
<p>During the match, the players will typically form <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess_strategy.html" title="Chess strategy">strategic</a> plans in their minds, then enter the candidate sequences of moves into the computer to analyze and make sure there are no <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blunder.html" title="Blunder">blunders</a> and other possible holes. The human player will compare the merits of each candidate sequence after having seen the computer's analysis, and may even introduce a new variation if time permits. The player will typically play out the move which he has established (with computer help) to be strongest. If there are two or more moves which the computer considers to be of equal strength (such situations are frequent), the human player will use his own strategic <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skill.html" title="Skill">skills</a> and <a href="../../../e/x/p/Experience.html" title="Experience">experience</a> and analytical judgment capabilities to decide which move to play. The human is in charge during the whole match, and is formally free to play any move he considers the best, at his own discretion. During the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess_opening.html" title="Chess opening">opening</a>, the players may consult a large <a href="../../../d/a/t/Database.html" title="Database">database</a> of opening moves and variations, containing <a href="../../../i/n/f/Information.html" title="Information">information</a> about who played a particular variation, when it was played, and with what success, though a particular <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tournament.html" title="Tournament">tournament</a>'s rules may prohibit using databases in such manner.</p>
<p>During the whole game, the players' computer <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_monitor.html" title="Computer monitor">monitors</a> are projected onto large screens, making it possible for the viewing audience to watch how the strongest players decide about their moves and make their plans. Typically there will be a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commentator.html" title="Commentator">commentator</a> in a separate room, equipped with the identical <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardware.html" title="Hardware">hardware</a> as players, which he will use to help him provide a commentary to the audience - this way the audience is given the real insight into the <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thought.html" title="Thought">thought</a> processes of the strongest players.</p>
<p>Although Advanced Chess play is at the highest level when performed by the top <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Grandmaster_2339.html" title="International Grandmaster">grandmasters</a>, it is not limited to them. Anyone can play Advanced Chess, sometimes with the same success as the strongest grandmasters. Occasionally, average players have been able to achieve a performance <a href="../../../e/l/o/Elo_rating_system.html" title="Elo rating system">rating</a> higher than the one of the computer programs they were using, and on rare occasions higher than the ratings of top grandmasters.</p>

<p>It has been debated, due to the peculiarities of the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human.html" title="Human">human</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer.html" title="Computer">computer</a> team, whether the human should be considered the Advanced Chess player, or rather the team itself should be considered the Advanced Chess player. It is the prevailing view that, due to the fact that the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human.html" title="Human">human</a> subordinates the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer.html" title="Computer">computer</a> in a meaningful intent to win a <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess.html" title="Chess">chess</a> <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game.html" title="Game">game</a>, and that the human is the one who makes the final decision about the move to be played, the human should be considered the Advanced Chess player. Some have also argued that the term "computer-assisted player" should not be used for an Advanced Chess player, as the key element is <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cooperation.html" title="Cooperation">cooperation</a>, not assistance.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/v/Advanced_Chess_36c1.html" title="Edit section: Advanced Chess on the Internet">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Advanced Chess on the Internet</span></h2>
<p>The ubiquity of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a> and a high number of commercial and free <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_chess_server.html" title="Internet chess server">Internet chess servers</a> has made it possible for anyone to play Advanced Chess over the Internet. There has not been organized Internet Advanced Chess play in quite a while, though, and few Internet chess systems have regulated rated Advanced Chess play. The world's largest <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organization.html" title="Organization">organization</a> for Advanced Chess on the Internet is the Advanced Chess Organization - CCO (this organization used to be known as Computer Chess Organization, and therefore kept the acronym CCO for historical reasons). CCO organizes regular Advanced Chess events, most of which take place on The <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_Internet_Chess_Server_9ad9.html" title="Free Internet Chess Server">Free Internet Chess Server</a> (FICS) or the correspondence website <a href="http://www.cowplay.com" class="external free" title="http://www.cowplay.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.cowplay.com</a>. One need not be a CCO member to participate in its tournaments, though the organization stresses that membership is highly desirable. CCO Advanced Chess events on the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a> usually employ unrated play, due to the fact that rated Advanced Chess play is still unregulated by most Internet chess systems, and use of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer.html" title="Computer">computers</a> in rated games is considered cheating and ruled out. CCO proposes that <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_chess_server.html" title="Internet chess server">Internet chess servers</a> introduce a third category of player - the "Advanced Chess player", among the existing human and computer players, latter of which usually labeled by "(C)", and that Advanced Chess players should be associated with a special Advanced Chess <a href="../../../e/l/o/Elo_rating_system.html" title="Elo rating system">rating</a> category. CCO points out that most <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_chess_server.html" title="Internet chess server">Internet chess servers</a> already have <a href="../../../s/o/f/Software.html" title="Software">software</a>-driven mechanisms which allow players to choose the types of the opponents they wish to play, therefore making it possible for a particular player to exclude all Advanced Chess players, should he/she not wish to play them.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/v/Advanced_Chess_36c1.html" title="Edit section: Cheating">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Cheating</span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheating_in_chess.html" title="Cheating in chess">Computer-assisted cheating</a> in online chess games is a problem, and should not be confused with Advanced Chess play. CCO argues that playing Advanced Chess is not cheating, because it is done with the fully informed consent of one's opponent. Many factors indicate that a large number of players are secretly using their <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_chess.html" title="Computer chess">chess programs</a> to aid their play against the chess servers' <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rule" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:rule">rules</a> of play, and there is no perfect mechanism to prevent this and ensure fair play on the Internet. Some have suggested that, for these reasons, <a href="../../../o/n/l/Online.html" title="Online">online</a> <a href="../../../e/l/o/Elo_rating_system.html" title="Elo rating system">rating</a> systems should be abolished completely, or that computer assistance in human rated play should be allowed for all rated games. Many oppose these views, CCO among them, arguing that it would make the otherwise sharp line between computer cheating and Advanced Chess rather blurred, and that <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_chess_server.html" title="Internet chess server">chess servers</a> do possess fairly good mechanisms to ensure fair play. CCO also adds, that if a new separate category of <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess.html" title="Chess">chess</a> - Advanced Chess - were introduced into rated Internet play, it would significantly reduce the number of cheating players, as they could then legitimately play Advanced Chess, without the need to secretly use their computer chess programs to their advantage.</p>
