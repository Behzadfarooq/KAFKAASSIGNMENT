	    <p>Modules for the game <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advanced_Squad_Leader_3cce.html" title="Advanced Squad Leader">Advanced Squad Leader</a> contained all the equipment needed to actually play the game. There are twelve official so-called "core" modules that contain the essential components for a complete order of battle of all major nationalities to participate in the Second World War. Ownership of all core modules was not a prerequisite to playing the game, and as few as one module can be used. In addition to core modules, other products were also available and may be loosely referred to as "modules", or in the more specific terms as Deluxe ASL Modules and Historical ASL Modules. These required previous ownership of some of the core modules in varying combinations, or at least the components of them (rules sections and counters, and sometimes mapboards).</p>
<p>Each module generally contained the complete order of battle for at least one nationality, including 1/2" counters depicting infantry <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squad.html" title="Squad">squads</a>, crews, and SMCs (single man counters) as well as infantry support weapons. Some modules expanded coverage with 5/8" counters depicting vehicles and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artillery.html" title="Artillery">ordnance</a>. Those modules with vehicle and ordnance counters generally also contained pages for Chapter H of the ASL Rulebook, which gave detailed notes and information on each type of vehicle or piece of ordnance.</p>
<p>Some modules also contained chapters specific to certain theatres, such as North Africa or the Pacific, where special rules for nationality distinctions, terrain and weather were required.</p>
<p>When the Finnish module "Hakkaa p채채lle" is released, the Advanced Squad Leader will become the first <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_tactics.html" title="Military tactics">tactical</a> level <a href="../../../w/a/r/Wargame.html" title="Wargame">wargame</a> in history to be able to portray the armies of every nationality that participated in hostilities in the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_World_War_e58d.html" title="Second World War">Second World War</a>.</p>

<p>This initial game featured all system counters necessary for playing ASL, as well as the complete infantry, vehicle and ordnance counter mix for the Germans, Russians and Finns. (A new edition published by MMP many years later deleted the Finnish counter mix but added the HASL Module "Red Barricades"). The scenarios were sometimes decried as lacklustre, and mainly centred on urban combat, in keeping with the four new mapboards issued with the game. Mapboard 1 from SL and mapboard 8 from GI were necessary to play four of the ten printed scenarios as well.</p>

<p>Scenarios: ASL1-ASL10 Scenarios (V.3): 123-136</p>
<p>A <b>2nd Edition</b> included additional counters for rules added in Chapter E (which was included with the 2nd Edition Rulebook), as well as changing the colour scheme for Finnish counters, and included the otherwise out of print Red Barricades HASL module, including two mapsheets, informational counters, and rulebook Chapter O).</p>
<p>The module featuring the Finnish order of battle, called Hakkaa P채채lle, is now in playtesting. It will include Board 52.</p>
<p>A <b>3rd Edition</b> released in December 2005 contained 10 geomorphic mapboards (done in the lighter style of the ASLSK boards), being reprints of the original <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squad_Leader_6837.html" title="Squad Leader">Squad Leader</a> boards 1, 2, 3 and 4, a reprint of the Cross of Iron board 5, and a reprint of board 8 from GI: Anvil of Victory, as well as reprints of the original Beyond Valor mapboards 20, 21, 22, and 23. The game also included 20 ASL scenarios and 4 six-sided dice in addition to 13 sets of counters for the complete Russian and German order of battle as well as the main system counters.</p>

<p>This game was the least expensive offering of the initial modules, containing a skeleton order of battle for US parachute troops in Normandy and their German opponents, a small sampling of system markers, and just one mounted mapboard. The game was billed as a self-contained introductory module, and came with a rulebook chapter (Chapter K) written in conversational style that contained examples of play and a basic grounding in ASL rules for newcomers to the system. The chapter was written as a "basic training" story and included Days 1 to 6 (other days were released as part of other modules). Unfortunately, boards 1 to 4 from the original SL was still a necessity for play of all eight scenarios contained in the game, so either ownership of SL was required, or the boards had to be ordered separately by mail. Ownership of the ASL Rulebook was also a requirement.</p>

<p>After the disappointment among SL fans when GI: Anvil of Victory contained no DYO values for American forces, the third module of Yanks made up for this, for those that could afford the steep cost of this module, which had both the ASL Rulebook and Beyond Valor as prerequisites, as well as board 2 from SL, board 7 from COD and board 12 from GI (if one wanted to play the preprinted scenarios). The entire order of battle for US forces in Europe (and North Africa) was included, along with Chapter E which contained "miscellaneous" rules for amphibious landings, night fighting, air support, weather, parachute drops, glider landings, boats, convoys, swimming, ammunition vehicles, and special barrage rules for OBA (Off Board Artillery). Unfortunately, for those not interested in US forces, Chapter E would have to be purchased separately by mail order if one wanted to simulate any of these aspects with any of the other nationalities (and many printed scenarios in future modules would in fact have ownership of Chapter E a prerequisite.) Chapter H pages for US forces were also included (with DYO values and special vehicle notes describing any special in-game characteristics for each vehicle and ordnance type, as well as a brief history of each). Note that only European and North African theatre forces were included, not US forces from the Pacific theatre.</p>

<p>Partisan also required the ASL Rulebook, Boards 1, 2, 3 and 4 from SL, and Beyond Valor as prerequisites to play the printed scenarios, as well as providing counters for "Partisan" or irregular forces that could represent western European Resistance members, Yugoslavian guerrillas, or Soviet partisan troops. A redo of Board 10 from the original Rogue Series boards was included in this module, with the new artwork up to the usual high standards of the mounted mapboards of every game in the series to date, as well as a brand new board.</p>

<p>West of Alamein brought the complete order of battle for British forces to ASL, and unlike COD/GI covered the entire war, both British and US manufactured vehicles and weapons. However, the scenarios focused on North Africa, and five new mapboards as well as a large number of cardboard terrain overlays were included, along with Chapter F with several pages of special rules for simulating combat in a desert environment. Only one printed scenario included with the game required a board from a previous module (Yanks) in order to play (as well as the Chapter E rules for parachute landings), though both the rulebook and Beyond Valor were prerequisites. The module was popular for the new terrain types it brought to the game, many veteran players describing this as the "long awaited desert module." Chapter H pages for British forces were also included (with DYO values and special vehicle notes describing any special in-game characteristics for each vehicle and ordnance type, as well as a brief history of each).</p>

<p>A proposed <b>2nd Edition</b> will reorganize the content of this module. The British/Commonwealth content was split into a separate purchase (see For King and Country). The 2nd Edition would contain Chapter F for the rulebook, associated information counters, and the 5 mapboards contained in the 1st Edition. For King and Country will now be an additional prerequisite to play scenarios A35-A42, also to be included in the 2nd Edition. A final addition is an installment of Chapter M of the rulebook, devoted to "ASL Analysis" and reprinting an article on desert tactics from The General Magazine.</p>

<p>The Last Hurrah brought a complete set of infantry counters for the so-called "Allied Minors" to generically represent soldiers from Poland, Norway, Belgium, The Netherlands, Greece, and some Yugoslavian forces. Prerequisites for the printed scenarios included with this module included the rulebook, <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advanced_Squad_Leader_Modules_daa2.html#Beyond_Valor" title="Advanced Squad Leader Modules">Beyond Valor</a>, and boards 2, 3 and 4 from SL. Also necessary for two of the scenarios (and not mentioned on the original packaging) was <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advanced_Squad_Leader_Modules_daa2.html#Yanks" title="Advanced Squad Leader Modules">Yanks</a>, or at the least, Chapter E which was included in that module. Another of the Rogue Boards was re-released, again with updated artwork to ASL standards, as well as a new board. The third mapboard in the game was a new offering. Some unique matchups were included in the scenarios, including Polish cavalry vs. German armoured cars and tanks, Yugoslavian cavalry vs. German motorcycles, and Polish cavalry vs. Russian armoured cars.</p>

<p>Scenarios: ASL43-ASL50</p>
<p>The module was reviewed in Volume 2, Number 15 of <b>Wargamer</b> (Sep-Oct <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>); Ted Bleck considered the game to be up to the usual high standards as far as components went (beautiful mounted mapboards as well as accurately printed and cut counters, easy to read and easy to separate from the "trees") but expressed disappointment at the focus of the module. No vehicles or ordnance were included (restricting play of the Allied Minors to just infantry/cavalry actions). The scenarios included were deemed to be "small by ASL standards" but fun and well balanced.</p>
<p>The <b>2nd Edition</b> also included Board 3 from the original Squad Leader series.</p>

<p>Hollow Legions contained a wealth of exclusively new materials unseen in the Squad Leader/ASL world before. The entire order of battle for the much-maligned Italian Army was included (along with the applicable Chapter H pages providing DYO values and special vehicle notes describing any special in-game characteristics for each vehicle and ordnance type, as well as a brief history of each). Two new desert boards were provided, and prerequisites for playing the scenarios were extensive, including the rulebook, Beyond Valor, West of Alamein, and Yanks, as well as board 4 from SL, board 7 from COD and board 12 from GI. A great variety of forces made up the scenarios, however, in addition to the varied terrain, with Italian forces variously fighting against British, American, Russian and German troops!</p>

<p>Code of Bushido was another departure for the ASL system, taking players for the first time to the Pacific Theatre of Operations (PTO).</p>
<p>The entire order of battle for the Japanese Army was included (along with the applicable Chapter H pages providing DYO values and special vehicle notes describing any special in-game characteristics for each vehicle and ordnance type, as well as a brief history of each). The first half of Chapter G was also included, introducing many special rules for the Japanese, as well as Pacific Theatre terrain. Four new boards were provided, representing mainly jungle terrain though using standard mapboard symbology from previous maps. Special rules converted woods to jungle, buildings to huts, etc. An extensive set of terrain overlays were also provided, much like the desert overlays in the West of Alamein module. Prerequisites for this game included the rulebook, Beyond Valor, Yanks, and West of Alamein as well as board 2 from SL. The US forces in the scenarios provided were representative of US Army units and thus no special counters or rules were needed, though the majority of scenarios dealt with Japanese troops fighting Russian, British, and Philippine partisan troops with only two situations involving American forces.</p>

<p>By the time Gung Ho was released, no serious player of ASL could deny that the system had become a highly complex and detailed game system that retained little of the playability of the original <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squad_Leader_6837.html" title="Squad Leader">Squad Leader</a>. Gung Ho introduced a complete order of battle for both Chinese forces and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Marine_Corps_e7db.html" title="United States Marine Corps">United States Marine Corps</a>, (along with the applicable Chapter H pages providing DYO values and special vehicle notes describing any special in-game characteristics for each Chinese vehicle and ordnance type, as well as a brief history of each, and also notes on amphibious craft as used by both sides in the Pacific). For anyone who had bought all the modules to date, they found that their rulebook was overflowing, with Chapter H alone having 112 pages. The second half of Chapter G was included, with special rules for amphibious operations, beach and ocean terrain (as well as more terrain overlays to help simulate these), tropical climate rules, new fortification types, and even rules for bulldozers. Prerequisites for this game included the rulebook, Beyond Valor, Yanks, West of Alamein, and Code of Bushido, as well as board 2 from SL.</p>

<p>Doomed Battalions was the last module published by Avalon Hill before the purchase by Hasbro, and expanded the earlier coverage of the Allied Minors by providing their vehicles and ordnance (along with the applicable Chapter H pages providing DYO values and special vehicle notes describing any special in-game characteristics for each vehicle and ordnance type, as well as a brief history of each). A rerelease of the Rogue Board 9 with improved artwork was accompanied by two brand new boards, as well as more terrain overlays. Twelve revised rulebook pages for the 1st Edition rulebook were also included. Prerequisites for playing the included scenarios were the rulebook, Beyond Valor, The Last Hurrah, Hollow Legions, and Yank, as well as boards 42 and 43 (only available by separate purchase through MMP who was selling these bundled with a set of new scenarios), board 32 from Partisan, and boards 2 and 3 from SL.</p>

<p>The <b>2nd Edition</b> is a bit of a misnomer; a small print run was made by Avalon Hill before MMP took over the franchise. A reissue of the module by MMP was made very quickly, however, the rules chapters of this so-called "2nd Edition" of DB were compatible with the 1st Edition ASL Rulebook, not the 2nd.</p>

<p>For King and Country was released, chronologically, after Doomed Battalions and is a reissue of material originally found in West of Alamein. The British order of battle has been split with the new 2nd edition of West of Alamein, which will include only desert terrain and rules, with King and Country containing the order of battle for British/Commonwealth forces. Included in this module are rereleases of mapboard 1 from SL, board 7 from COD, and boards 8 and 12 from GI. The Chapter H pages for the British are included in this module, and 20 scenarios round out the contents. The decision by MMP not to reprint the earlier SL/COI/COD/GI games no doubt prompted the decision to reissue these boards, which would otherwise be available only through special order. In order to play all included scenarios, however, prerequisites include the rulebook and Beyond Valor as well as mapboards 2, 3 and 4 from SL, board 5 from COI, board 6 from COD, boards 13 and 14 from GI, board 9 from Doomed Battalions, board 10 from Partisan (also not being reprinted), and boards 11 and 33 from The Last Hurrah.</p>

<p>Of all the SL and ASL games, gamettes and modules, Armies of Oblivion had perhaps the longest and most dubious history. An article in the Sep-Oct 2004 issue of View From the Trenches (a long running third party publication for ASL begun in the UK in March 1995 and still in bi-monthly publication) listed the progress of this module.</p>
<ul>
<li>January 1996 - Shortly after <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multi-Man_Publishing_7ba9.html" title="Multi-Man Publishing">Multi-Man Publishing</a> (MMP) acquired the rights to oversee development of ASL products, Brian Youse declared a "strong desire to finish the game system and get out the Allied/Axis Minor Armour and Ordnance."</li>
<li>November 1996 - Brian Youse comments that Armies of Oblivion (AOO) is put on the back burner until at least 1998.</li>
<li>January 1997 - AOO details are announced; game will include 4 boards, 16 scenarios, and both Allied and Axis counters</li>
<li>May 1997 - playtesting commences, no confirmation if one module or two will be released</li>
<li>September 1997 - it is announced that AOO will be split into two modules, the first to be published in September 1998</li>
<li>March 1998 - Doomed Battalions (DB) announced for a summer release with AOO expected to follow in 1999</li>
<li>September 1998 - <a href="../../../a/v/a/Avalon_Hill_d3a2.html" title="Avalon Hill">Avalon Hill</a> is sold, DB released</li>
<li>March 1999 - MMP announces 1999 schedule, AOO is not on it</li>
<li>January 2000 - AOO expected to be released before a product called "Intro ASL", sometime in the last half of 2001</li>
<li>July 2000 - boards 48, 49 and 50 are released for separate sale but testing of AOO continues</li>
<li>September 2000 - MMP confident of Christmas release of AOO</li>
<li>November 2000 - release of AOO now expected to be in the first quarter of 2001</li>
<li>September 2001 - AOO scheduled for release in 2002</li>
<li>January 2002 - public information points lengthy playtesting delaying release of AOO</li>
<li>March 2002 - counter and rules artwork nearing completion</li>
<li>September 2002 - Curt Schilling makes public statement that AOO "is less than one year away"</li>
<li>January 2003 - MMP announced desire to release AOO by October; 10 scenarios completed with two to six more required</li>
<li>May 2003 - MMP reports one scenario left to complete along with counter layout and vehicle notes</li>
<li>November 2003 - AOO goes on pre-order</li>
<li>March 2004 - AOO due to be printed soon according to MMP</li>
<li>May 2004 - MMP announces final layout to be done soon</li>
</ul>
<p>Armies Of Oblivion was released in January, 2006.</p>
<p>Hakkaa P채채lle - Finnish - Module 13, having missed the 2006 target date, hopefully to be released sometime in 2007 (tentative). (To be last "core" module)</p>
