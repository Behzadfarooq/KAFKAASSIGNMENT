<p>Under "AP Scholar Designations" there is a passage reading: <i>"All AP exams taken" refers to all AP exams taken in any year. It is not restricted to the year the award is issued in.</i> Does this mean that the award is issued to students that, say, took two AP classes in their Junior year, one in their Senior year and were given the award in their Senior year; or to students who took three in their Junior year and were given the award in their Senior year?</p>

<p>It is incorrect grammar to write of plural exams as "AP's". The &lt;apostrophe-s&gt; construction is for indicating a noun's possession, such as "Harvard's students". Correct usage is "APs".

<p>If you take 2 AP courses in your junior year and 1 in your senior year, you will receive the award if your scores are high enough. You also will receive the reward if you take all 3 AP courses in your junior year. This is not the problem, though, that the statement was addressing. It was addressing the problem of a student who takes maybe 3 AP classes junior year and receives all 1s. Then, takes 3 more senior year and receives all 4s. Since their average is only a 2.5, they can not receive the award. --<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChocolateluvr88_5ace.html" title="User:Chocolateluvr88">chocolateluvr88</a> 11:08, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'd like to add a bit about the exorbitant fees charged by ETS/TCB for the tests. Grumbling over the $82/test cost has gotten quite loud lately, with some schools considering decertifying AP classes in protest of the fees.

<dd>My school had us bring the $82 checks, a week later they gave them back and had us bring in $22. They said something big was happening with the A.P. association or something, but would not tell us more. I'm guessing it was the school or state reembursing the students taking the test, but you never know?</dd>

<p>I feel like someone need to add specific scores to score 1-5 scales on the test.</p>
<p>Examplify: 50+ Correct on Multiple choice and at least 7 on essay to score 5 on World History. 30+ correct on multiple choice and at least 6 on essay to score 3 or above.</p>

<p>Students taking Advanced Placement classes receive an extra grade point in the calculation of their grade point averages (GPA's). A GPA is the average of all grades a student has had over a certain number of classes. Historically, GPA's used the following numerical values: A = 4.0, A- = 3.7, B + = 3.3, B = 3.0, and so on down to F = 0.0. Thus, a student receiving all A's in high school, using this value system, would have a 4.0 high school GPA.</p>
<p>Advanced Placement classes add an extra 1.0 to each value, so that an A is worth 5.0, a B is worth 4.0, and so on. Presumably, the reasoning behind this was to reflect the increased difficult of Advanced Placement courses as compared to regular courses. For example, a student who could easily obtain an A (4.0) in a regular math class, might only obtain B (3.0) in a college level Advanced Placement Calculus class. This student could be the brightest at his or her school, but could end up with a mediocre GPA because of taking numerous Advanced Placement courses. The lower GPA could have implications for college admissions. Thus, bright students could be deterred from attempting to take Advanced Placement courses without a GPA incentive.</p>
<p>The GPA incentive has altered what the highest attainable GPA is for a high school graduate. Before GPA incentives were introduced, a 4.0 GPA was the highest attainable GPA for any high school graduate, reflecting straight A's in all high school classes. With GPA incentives, students receiving some B's or even C's could still graduate with a GPA over 4.0 if they have taken enough classes with GPA incentives.</p>
<p>The GPA incentive also creates a disincentive for students to take non-Advanced Placement courses, which may have an effect as more Advanced Placement courses are offered which are elective in nature. Due to GPA incentives, the determination of who is class valedictorian (highest GPA) or class salutorian (second highest GPA) will depend more than ever on class selection. Students who want any realistic chance at being declared valedictorian or salutorian must take a competitive number of Advanced Placement courses. Presumably, the net effect is that top students will display less diversity in their selection of elective courses, tending rather to cluster around those electives that offer GPA incentives.</p>
<p>Another impact of GPA incentives is that there is no longer any objective "highest attainable GPA" for a high school graduate. The highest possible GPA at any particular high school now depends on exactly how many non-redundant Advanced Placement courses that high school offers (redundant Advanced Placement courses are those that, for whatever reason, cannot both be taken by the same student). The most affluent high schools could offer over a dozen Advanced Placement courses, leading to GPA's for graduating seniors in excess of 4.5. However, high schools with more limited resources might offer a handful or less Advanced Placement courses. Some high schools may offer none at all. The result is that college admissions personnel must weigh an incoming student's GPA in light of the number of Advanced Placement courses offered by that student's high school, in order to avoid having an admissions system even more biased in favor of affluent high schools.</p>
<p>Somewhat illusrative of the societal factors that deter the proliferation of Advanced Placement courses in poorer schools, the 1988 film Stand and Deliver, starring Edward James Olmos and based on a true story, portrays an inner city math teacher who introduces an Advanced Placement calculus class to his students.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This isn't the case at every school. My school does not have weighted grades, thus earning an A in an AP class is the same as earning an A in a regular class. Our GPA can not go any higher than 4.0. The incentive comes in when you're applying for colleges and they see that you have taken AP, honors, and college courses, yet have still retained a high GPA, whereas they will frown on those who have not tried to take AP courses. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChickenflicker_66a8.html" title="User:Chickenflicker">Chickenflicker</a>---<a href="../../../c/h/i/User_talk%7EChickenflicker_e5c0.html" title="User talk:Chickenflicker">♣</a> 15:25, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Highly motivated, highly driven, highly compensated parents want their children to "succeed." Success is measured by making lots of money. Making lots of money generally implies advanced degrees from prestigious universities. Admissions to those places means being able to pay for tuition, room, board, and books, should the relatively minor detail of admission be disposed of. Admission to prestigious universities is generally restricted to "highly qualified" individuals, meaning those students who have already demonstrated an ability to take and pass examinations with astounding marks. Successful kids of successful parents must take Advanced Placement courses in High School so as to demonstrate to admissions committees their "love of learning." Actually, love of learning has nothing to do with it. The Advanced Placement courses go hand in hand with calculated participation in sports and community outreach programs that demonstrate some rich sixteen-year-old kid has the chops of a 40-year-old Republican lawyer insofaras perceptions are manipulated as a means to an end. Corruption is as corruption does. Let's paint a pretty picture. It may be clown art or felt Elvis, but it gets the job done. 70.108.163.128 14:07, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Are AP courses taken during the last two years of high school or only during the final year?</li>
<li>Up to how many AP courses can be taken during a semester/school year?</li>
<li>What is the reputation, extent of recognition amongst universities, and academic rigour of the AP Program compared to the IB Diploma Programme, the French Baccalauréat, the Italian Maturitá, the Swiss Maturité, the German Abitur, and the British A-Levels?</li>
</ul>

<dd>AP courses can be taken any year of high school, and you can take as many as you want. One problem is that the exam schedule at the end of the year often schedules two exams to be taken at one time, and I'm pretty sure you can't take the exam at a different time than is scheduled. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChickenflicker_66a8.html" title="User:Chickenflicker">Chickenflicker</a>---<a href="../../../c/h/i/User_talk%7EChickenflicker_e5c0.html" title="User talk:Chickenflicker">♣</a> 15:28, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What about the AP Audit which may get rid of AP courses at High schools, or reduce them to nothing more than Advanced (course)?</p>

<p>I just found a very interesting comparison of the AP and the IB programs. <a href="http://www.ais-salzburg.at/18.0.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ais-salzburg.at/18.0.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> I think we should include these points and maybe organize them into a table (which I sadly cannot do). Please give your opinions. Thanks, (<a href="../../../e/d/e/User%7EEdebundity_6039.html" title="User:Edebundity">Eddie</a> 03:50, 25 February 2007 (UTC))</p>

<ul>
<li>Students can build up an AP profile over the course of several years. <b>vs.</b> Student are restricted to completing the IB diploma program during the final two years of school.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Students sit examinations as they complete the respective course. <b>vs.</b> Student write all examinations at the completion of the second year of the program.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Students can sample a wide variety of advanced courses. <b>vs.</b> Students must enroll in six two year courses, excluding other possible interests.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Each course combines breadth and depth in treating the subject. <b>vs.</b> Each course emphasizes depth of treatment, not breadth.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The flexibility of the AP program allows for additional boarding-school demands on student time. <b>vs.</b> The inflexibility of the IB program does not allow, or comes into conflict with, some boarding-school requirements.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Entrance to German universities requires 4 examinations in year-long AP subjects, one of which must be mathematics or science. <b>vs.</b> German universities require the entire IB diploma program plus four years of a second foreign language.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Austrian universities require 4 AP examinations in year-long subjects, one of which must be calculus. <b>vs.</b> Austrian universities require the entire IB diploma program.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>British universities require three AP examinations. <b>vs.</b> British universities require the entire IB diploma program.</li>
</ul>

<p>New comment: To me this shows a clear bias in favor of the AP program. Could we make it more balanced? -<a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESocratesJedi_4545.html" title="User:SocratesJedi">SocratesJedi</a> | <a href="../../../s/o/c/User_talk%7ESocratesJedi_9c57.html" title="User talk:SocratesJedi">Talk</a> 08:18, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree about the bias; however, as far as I'm concerned, the information is correct. (<a href="../../../e/d/e/User%7EEdebundity_6039.html" title="User:Edebundity">Eddie</a> 22:04, 25 February 2007 (UTC))</dd>

<dd>Unfortunately, the info is not correct. It states a fundamental misunderstanding of the Diploma Programme. Ther comparison is flawed on numerous levels including (but not exhausted by) the length of the IBD "course", the IBD emphasisises both intellectual rigour and breadth, (the borading school issue is irrelevant), entrance requirements are not correct to Universities nor are they fixed, British Universites do take students who have not fulfilled the entire Diploma. It misses the whole relevance of equivalencies, the grades/marks which must be obtained, CAS, World Lit, Extended Essay etc. A pointless comparison in many respects.</dd>

<dd>Can I add, BTW, that the opening remark of this article, "<i>the Advanced Placement Program, commonly known as Advanced Placement, or AP, is a United States and Canada-based program that offers high school students the opportunity to receive university credit for their work during high school, as well as a standard measure of achievement in a particular course</i>... " is incorrect in that it does not offer university credit in the vast majority non-US/Canadian Universities outside the US and Canada. In the UK, for example, successfully completeing the required number of APs with grades and after interviews, a successfully placed student will simply end up with no advanced placement on a "standard" 3 years hono(u)rs university degree. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECandorwien_f900.html" title="User:Candorwien">Candy</a> 10:13, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
