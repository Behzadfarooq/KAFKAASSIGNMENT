In the series, Alice (played by <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elisabeth_Harnois_726f.html" title="Elisabeth Harnois">Elisabeth Harnois</a>), is portrayed as a girl who can go to and from Wonderland simply by walking through her mirror (most likely a reference to Wonderland's source material <a href="../../../l/e/w/Lewis_Carroll_a8ad.html" title="Lewis Carroll">Lewis Carroll's</a> <a href="../../../t/h/r/Through_the_Looking_Glass_a147.html" title="Through the Looking Glass">Through the Looking Glass</a>).</p>
<p>Usually the format consisted of Alice coming home from school and talking to Dinah (her cat) about a problem facing her that day, then going into Wonderland and finding the residents of that world facing a similar crisis. At the end of each episode she would return to the real world with a solution to her problem. In some cases, Alice would have a problem with her little brother, her older sister, a friend, or some other dilemma, and by the show's end, she would know how to deal with it. In "To Tear Is Human," Alice learns a lesson in humility when she splits her pants in the middle of a charades game, making her not so quick to laugh at other people's misfortune. (Earlier in the episode, she had laughed at another student for dropping his lunch tray.)</p>

<p>Adventures in Wonderland Episode Guide</p>
<p>1. Herstory in the Making Alice lacks the confidence to write a story for a school assignment, so she enlists the help of her friends in Wonderland. Thinking that she’s gotten them to do her homework for her, she quickly discovers that, when other people do your work, it doesn’t always turn out the way you’d like.</p>
<p>2. Lip-Sunk The Queen is slated to give a speech at a royalty convention when she suddenly loses her voice. While the Wonderland characters literally scramble to look for her lost voice, Alice tries to convince them that it’s just an idiom and there’s no need to search.</p>
<p>3. Red Queen for a Day When Alice becomes Queen for a day, her royal decisions alienate her Wonderland friends, and she learns that being in charge also carries responsibility.</p>
<p>4. Objects d’Heart The Queen decides to take up sculpture as a hobby. Even though the Wonderland residents think her work is awful, they all compliment the Queen for her talents. Thinking that everyone loves her creations, she gives them away as gifts. Soon, unsightly statuary is popping up all over Wonderland.</p>
<p>5. Arriverderci Aroma! The Queen orders perfume from The Royal Catalog at the same time the Hatter orders spray paint. Unfortunately, there is a mix-up of parcels. Alice and her friends learn a lesson about the value of reading directions.</p>
<p>6. The Bunny Flop The Queen and the White Rabbit appear on “Lifestyles of the Royal and Famous,” but the live interview goes awry when the Rabbit, who was awake all night, has trouble keeping his eyes open and his mouth shut.</p>
<p>7. Pop Goes the Easel On the day the Queen’s official portrait is to be unveiled, the White Rabbit trips and puts his head through the canvas. All in Wonderland attempt to restore a painting.</p>
<p>8. Through the Looking Glasses The Cheshire Cat gives Rabbit a pair of rose-colored glasses and convinces him that they magically make everything beautiful. Eventually, everyone (but the Queen) realizes that the glasses were a hoax. They learn that it’s not how you look at things, but how you think about them that counts.</p>
<p>9. That’s All, Jokes! A practical-joke marathon is sweeps through Wonderland, and soon everyone is obsessed with getting even. The potpourri of pranks finally stops when the Queen falls victim to a trick. As a result, Alice learns that, by “getting even,” a person sometimes get more than was expected.</p>
<p>10. Forget Me Knot The Queen goes to “Professor Memory” to improve her memory, while the Rabbit goes all over Wonderland in search of the book in which he put the Queen’s theater tickets. Rabbit, Alice, and the Queen learn some new memory skills.</p>
<p>11. Boo, Who? The Queen thinks the palace is haunted when she spies a ghost wandering the halls. What’s worse, it appears the famished phantom is gobbling up the jelly beans meant for the Royal Jelly-Bean Counting Contest. The Queen orders the Rabbit to stand guard, but in reality there is no starved spook…merely a sleepwalking White Rabbit.</p>
<p>12. Double Your Bunny The White Rabbit’s identical cousin comes to Wonderland to look at vacation property. But Rabbit is unable to meet his cousin’s train, forcing this White Rabbit look-alike to wander Wonderland alone. Confusion and crabbiness abound when Wonderland’s residents don’t realize there’s a new bunny on the block.</p>
<p>13. Diary of a Mad Hatter/Keep It Under Your Hat The Mad Hatter finds his great-grandhatter’s diary, which contains clues to a hidden treasure. The ensuing treasure hunt leads Wonderland’s residents on a merry chase, but eventually the treasure is found. To everyone’s surprise, the treasure is a collection of -what else?-hats!</p>
<p>14. How the West Was Wonderland A rodeo is coming to Wonderland, and the Queen resolves to be “Queen of the Rodeo.” But, when she discovers that a rodeo queen has to ride a horse, she’s worried, because horses scare her. Her pride keeps her from admitting her fear, but Alice and the White Rabbit figure out her problem and provide her with a way to save face.</p>
<p>15. The Rules of the Game Alice gets a lesson in playing by the rules after several frustrating rounds of Miwok, a game in which the rules can be changed at any moment. The final straw comes when the Queen changes the rules after the game is over so that she, instead of the Tweedles, is declared the winner.</p>
<p>16. Something to Sneeze At The Mad Hatter suddenly becomes allergic to his best friend, the March Hare. But the March Hare is determined not to allow the Hatter’s sneeze to put the freeze on their friendship.</p>
<p>17. Off the Cuffs/Hare-Raising Magic The March Hare’s magic act goes awry when his “Magic Handcuffs” fail to open. First the Queen, then half of Wonderland, get “tied up” -until the Hare finds the missing key.</p>
<p>18. Tooth or Consequences The White Rabbit has a toothache that just won’t quit, but his fear of going to the dentist causes him to procrastinate.</p>
<p>19. The Wonderland Enquirer The Queen, annoyed with dull stories in the Wonderland daily paper, orders the editors (Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee) to print every juicy rumor they hear, whether the stories can be verified or not. The Queen loves the newspaper, until she becomes a victim of the rumor mill herself.</p>
<p>20. The Hatter Who Came to Dinner When the Hatter’s back goes out in the line of duty, the Queen and the Rabbit feel obliged to put him up until he’s better. The Hatter proceeds to take advantage of “the royal treatment,” until they find out he’s faking and call his bluff.</p>
<p>21. The Mirth of a Nation While attending her “Mirthday” party, the Queen bumps her funny bone and loses her sense of humor. When she subsequently decides to ban all laughter from Wonderland, her subjects get serious and plot to restore mirth to Her Majesty.</p>
<p>22. For Better or Verse Rabbit gets rhymitis and is banned by the Queen until he gets rid of it. The irritating condition is passed all around Wonderland, until at last it hits the Queen, right when she needs the rhyming disease in order to beat the Duchess in a contest.</p>
<p>23. TechnoBunny With the White Rabbit on vacation, the Queen gets a temporary robot replacement to do his work. The robot is so efficient that it looks as if the White Rabbit may be out of work permanently…until the Queen’s failure to follow directions causes a surprising malfunction.</p>
<p>24. Party-Pooped The Mad Hatter is annoyed with the March Hare’s chronic tardiness to the tea party. The resulting quarrel splits up the friends, and, in a fit of pique, the Hare throws his own party at exactly the Hatter’s teatime. When Wonderland’s residents find this two-party system too tiring (and too filling), they resolve to get the Hatter and the Hare back together.</p>
<p>25. Up and Anthem When the Wonderland nation anthem is deemed un-singable, the Queen decrees an anthem-writing contest to choose a new one. The White Rabbit, who authored the original anthem, is sure his song is perfect and refuses to write a new anthem. But the competition makes him realize that his song could stand a little improvement, so he decides to “change his tune.”</p>
<p>26. Pretzelmania It appears that the Rabbit has dropped the Queen’s diamond ring into the Hatter’s new pretzel machine…thereby baking it into one of the 100 pretzels. But which one? The Rabbit’s friends pig out on pretzels, hoping to find the ring before the Queen finds out about the whole silly mishap.</p>
<p>27. White Elephant Sale At a royal garage sale, the Queen unloads a (real) white elephant. In the hands of its new owners, however, the useless item is recycled into a whirlpool bath, a barbecue, and, finally, a prized art deco lamp sought after by none other than the Queen.</p>
<p>28. Rip-Roaring Rabbit Tales/Rabbit Without a Cause The White Rabbit, who has become convinced his life lacks excitement, imagines himself in a series of storybook adventures. But, when he narrowly averts disaster with the Queen’s flower-vase collection, he decides that sometimes it’s best when excitement is only found in the pages of a book.</p>
<p>29. Happy Boo Boo Day The Queen tells the Rabbit she doesn’t want a birthday party this year, because her subjects always manage to goof it up. Despite the Queen’s wishes, Rabbit sets into motion plans for a surprise party, to prove that they can throw a successful party. Of course, the party gets goofed-up big time, but the Queen learns that “it’s the thought that counts.”</p>
<p>30. What Makes Rabbit Run/The Duchess Who Would Be Queen To prove how popular she is, the Queen decides to run for office in a Wonderland-wide election. She orders the reluctant White Rabbit to be her opponent, assuming it will just be for appearances. But the Rabbit’s popularity grows, and the Queen is forced to rethink her way of ruling Wonderland.</p>
<p>31. Friday the Umpteenth When Alice tells the Hatter and Hare about the superstition that Friday the 13th is bad luck, she unknowingly sets off a Wonderland panic. Fear of bad luck keeps Wonderland’s residents from enjoying themselves, until they realize that good luck is sometimes a matter of perspective.</p>
<p>32. Pizza De Resistance Disgusted with the quality of take-out pizza in Wonderland, the Queen dubs the White Rabbit “Royal Pizza Chef.” He doesn’t want the job, because it will force him to cook dinner on “pizza night,” his one night off. The resourceful bunny convinces the Queen to hold a contest instead and choose the Royal Pizza Chef from the entrants.</p>
<p>33. A Litter Help From My Friends When keeping Wonderland litter-free becomes a bigger job than one bunny can handle, the White Rabbit enlists the help of all of Wonderland’s residents. The blustery weather seem for a moment to be helpful in blowing away trash-until all the loose litter lands right in the middle of the Wonderland picnic site.</p>
<p>34. Busy as a Spelling Bee The Queen is appalled at the bad spelling in thank-you notes from her subjects. When Alice explains that her school holds spelling bees every year as a way to help children improve their spelling, the Queen decides it is time to schedule Wonderland’s first spelling bee.</p>

<p>36. He’s Not Heavy, He’s My Hatter After indulging in too many of Granny Hatter’s cookies, the Mad Hatter is forced to go on a diet and exercise program.

<p>37. Invasion of the Tweedle Snatchers When the Cheshire Cat commandeers a remote-controlled toy flying saucer, the Mad Hatter and the March Hare think that Wonderland is being invaded from outer space.

<p>38. Bubble Trouble The Red Queen cuts costs at the palace by canceling the bottled water delivery and tapping Wonderland’s own underground spring. The spring, however, is mysteriously polluted by someone in Wonderland, despite the White Rabbit’s efforts as water monitor.</p>
<p>39. The Bunny Who Would Be King Movie star Rabbit DeNiro is coming to Wonderland to see his brother, the White Rabbit, whom he think is the King. The White Rabbit’s friends help him ascend to the throne, and the charade seems to work…until the Queen returns.</p>
<p>40. Welcome Back Hatter The Hatter wins what appears to be a huge castle via a mail-order sweepstakes and prepares to move out of Wonderland. The Hare is sad that his best friend is leaving, but decides to hide his true feelings to avoid upsetting the Hatter.</p>
<p>41. Noses off While trying to help Her Majesty come up with an original costume for an upcoming masquerade ball, the Hatter and Hare accidentally attach a ridiculous rubber nose to the Queen’s face, then can’t get it off. The Queen scrambles to get out of her predicament before that afternoon’s photo session with “Palace Beautiful” magazine.</p>
<p>42. This Bunny for Hire The White Rabbit breaks one of the Queen’s vases, which he assumes his valuable crystal. Rather than tell the Queen what happened, he works nonstop, moonlighting to make enough money to buy a replacement-only to discover, too late, that the original vase was merely inexpensive glass.</p>
<p>43. All That Glitters/Forbidden Fruit Tweedle Dum ignores Caterpillar’s warnings and eats a dangerous new fruit that can make him stronger, but may also make him very sick. A bellyache results, and Tweedle Dum learns to heed future warnings.</p>
<p>44. Whose Carrots Are They, Anyway? The Rabbit is proud of his carrot crop, and would like to invite his friends from Wonderland to a simple carrot-tasting party. However, many of the Rabbit’s friends proceed to turn his simple party into the biggest, glitziest event of the season.</p>
<p>45. Say It Again, Ma’am! The Rabbit misunderstands a royal edict, but is too intimidated by the Queen to ask her to repeat herself. He enlists help from Wonderland’s other residents to deduce what the Queen meant, but comes to a conclusion that only adds to the confusion.</p>
<p>46. Lady and the Camp The White Rabbit buys flowers for the Queen, only to find out that the blossoms are full of bugs. While the Hatter and the Hare de-bug the palace, the Queen camps out in the woods for the night and discovers that it’s too tough to rough it when you’re used to the soft life.</p>
<p>47. Gowns and Roses The Red Queen hears there is money to be made by putting her name on a clothing label, so she designs her own fashion line. When the model fails to arrive for the fashion show, the Queen is shocked to see Rabbit on the runway.</p>
<p>48. Dinner Fit for a Queen When the Tweedles submit a tape to “Wonderland’s Silliest Home Videos,” the Red Queen’s dignity is destroyed. She attempts to reclaim it with a staged dinner party for “Royalty’s Favorite Home Videos.”</p>

<p>51. Copy-Catter Hatter The Mad Hatter’s reputation is at stake after his royal hat designs are copied by the rascally Copy-Catter Hatter. The Mad Hatter foils his plagiarizing cousin by leaving out a design that the Red Queen is sure to dislike.</p>
<p>52. Queen of the Beasts/The Greatest Story Never Sold When the Red Queen decides her life lacks excitement, she becomes a wild wobear tamer. The Wonderland inhabitants are impressed, until they discover that the ferocious wild animal is a cute, cuddly wobear cub.</p>
<p>53. Vanity Hare When the March Hare inadvertently helps the Queen solve her crossword puzzle, she bestows upon him the Smarty Pants Medal. Soon, the Hare gets too high an opinion of his own intelligence, until he finds out that being a smarty pants sometimes means being too big for your britches.</p>
<p>54. The Best Ears of Our Lives When White Rabbit tires of being ignored, he tries to get attention by yelling and then by being silent. However, he discovers that the best way to make people curious about what you have to say is simply to speak softly.</p>

<p>58. On a Roll The Mad Hatter’s cousin Hedda Hatter is coming for a visit. Hedda is differently abled, and, when she writes that the only drawback is “stairs,” the Wonderland gang thinks she means “stares,” so no one will look at poor Hedda.</p>
<p>59. The Grap Juice of Wrath The White Rabbit spills grape juice on the Queen’s throne and enlists Wonderland’s other residents to help him remove the spot before the Queen returns from a day of picking blueberries.

<p>60. Homing Pigeons After losing his house key for the umpteenth time, Hatter invents a house key homing device. Hoping to cash in on his invention, he stages a demonstration.

<p>63. Hippity Hoppity Hypnotist The March Hare accidentally hypnotizes the Red Queen into acting like a chicken when the word “red” is spoken. The White Rabbit isn’t aware of this, until the Red Queen is about to go on Wonderland TV.</p>
<p>64. Christmas in Wonderland Christmas is nearly ruined when the Red Queen hears about Alice’s “white” Christmas and decides she won’t be happy until she gets her own snowfall. There’s only one problem: It has never snowed in Wonderland, and it would take a miracle for it to start. Maybe a Christmas miracle?</p>
<p>65. Day of the Iguanas When the Red Queen banishes a fortune teller from the palace, the White Rabbit fears a retaliatory curse has turned Her Majesty into an iguana.</p>
<p>66. I Am the Walrus When the Red Queen refuses to exclude a walrus from Wonderland, the other residents, who have “heard” that walruses are dishonest, rude, and even smelly, attempt to make him feel unwelcome. They don’t listen to Alice when she says that the walrus is very nice. But, when the Queen gives them a taste of their own medicine and a throws a walrus-only party, they finally see the error of their ways.</p>
<p>67. Weed Shall Overcome The Red Queen’s plans for a new royal tennis court are delayed when the Walrus discovers a rare plant growing on the site.

<p>70. The Days of Vine and Roses The Red Queen’s chances for having her palace make the cover of “Better Palaces and Gardens” magazine are jeopardized when some of Wonderland’s residents fail to follow the care instructions for an exotic plant. Soon the palace is completely overgrown by a massive tangle of vines.</p>
<p>71. The Clan of the Cavebunny A simple spelunking expedition turns up the discovery of the year: a bunny frozen in a block of ice. It is really a prehistoric cavebunny? All of Wonderland will soon find out, because it suddenly comes to life.</p>
<p>72.

Even so, the package turns out to be just as good at teaching Hatter a lesson about respecting people’s private property.</p>

<p>84. The Royalty Trap On the day the Red Queen is to be feted by the Royalty Hall of Fame, she accidentally locks herself in the royal tool shed. The Duchess seizes her chance to “help” the Queen by standing in for her at the ceremony-in hopes of grabbing all the attention that was meant for Her Majesty.</p>
<p>85. Just the Fax, Ma’am/Duchess Treat With the annual fund-raiser for the Wonderland library on deck, the Red Queen is intent on upstaging the Duchess in the fashion department and finally getting her picture on the society page. In her eagerness to get the fashion scoop, the Red Queen learns that sometimes the faz can be confusing.</p>
<p>86. Take the Bunny and Run/Other People’s Bunny The Red Queen learns just how nice it is to have a bunny around the house after recklessly losing White Rabbit in a bet to the Duchess. When she finds Rabbit is just as unhappy about the change of employers, the Queen makes plans to get the bunny back.</p>
<p>87. Gratitude Adjustment The Red Queen cancels “Thanks-a-lot Day,” a day dedicated to gratitude, because she doesn’t see the point of the holiday. Wonderland’s residents try to help her understand what it means to be thankful, but it takes a call from her mom to finally get the ungrateful Queen to realize that even royal folks need to say “thank you” sometimes.</p>
<p>88. Pie Noon When the pie-throwing bully from the March Hare’s high school day arrives at the Wonderland train station at high noon, the Hare panics, because none of his friends will stand with him against the bully.</p>
<p>89. Untwist of Fate Wonderland is worried that Alice won’t be able to play Juliet in Shakespaw’s “Rabbit and Juliet” because she has come down with a bad case of “tongue twisters” and can only speak in silly phrases.</p>
<p>90. Queen’s Best Friend The Cheshire Cat plays a trick on the Red Queen and leads her to believe that the stray dog she found can talk. The Queen, sure that a talking dog will bring her fame and fortune, books a spot on a TV program to showcase her talented terrier. But, to the Queen’s chagrin, the previously garrulous dog is a as quiet as a mouse once it’s on the air.</p>
<p>91. Purple Potato Eaters When Wonderland’s residents get a whiff of a batch of purple potato pancakes the Walrus is eating, they want to try them. The complicated recipe, however, makes them reluctant to help make more batter. After the Cheshire Cat tricks them into helping prepare the pancakes in spite of themselves, they learn that working for something helps one to appreciate it.</p>
<p>92. The Queen Who Came in From the Cold The Red Queen, crabby about all the anonymous letters in the paper complaining about her rash of newly imposed taxes, dons a disguise and goes undercover to root out the letter-writers. To her surprise, she ends up agreeing with the writers’ gripes, and must face the difficult task of admitting she is wrong.</p>
<p>93. The Color of Wobucks When the White Rabbit gets bamboozled by a con man into spending the Red Queen’s money on a seed for a phony money tree, his friends try to help out by “planting” one of their own. When this scheme backfires, the Queen herself comes up with a plan to bamboozle the bamboozler.</p>
<p>94. Take My Tonsils The Mad Hatter, tired of having sore throats, finally overcomes his fear and has his tonsils out. Judge Reinhold plays the doctor who performs the tonsillectomy on the Hatter.</p>
<p>95. The Sound and The Furry After the crabby Red Queen orders an afternoon of silence, the March Hare’s hearing-impaired cousin, April Hare (Marlee Matlin), visits to teach everyone sign-language. A misunderstanding leads to the Queen banishing the cousin from Wonderland and nearly turning a deaf ear to her own mistake.</p>
<p>96. Hats Off to the King After hearing the Mad Hatter perform a simple, down-to-earth song, the Tweedles arrange for him to compete on “Wonderland Star Hunt,” where Ed McMahon hosts the Best Male Singer Contest. Alas, the Hatter succumbs to all things “flashy, glitzy, and showbizzy,” and he makes a fool of himself on the show.</p>
<p>97. Those Tusks, Those Eyes The Walrus gets roped into performing his old precision creampuff-throwing act, with the Red Queen as his assistant. He has become very nearsighted, however, since he last did his act. At first his vanity keeps him from wearing glasses, but, when it becomes clear that his choice is either to wear the glasses or make a spectacle of himself -and Her Majesty-he finally visits the eye doctor.</p>
<p>98. Bah, Hamburger Tweedle Dum learns about good eating habits and the consequences of his obsession with eating junk food, when he is visited by the spirits of Nutrition Past, Present, and Future.</p>
<p>99. White Rabbits Can't Jump O.J. Simpson helps the White Rabbit play basketball.</p>
<p>100. A Wonderland Howl-oween At the traditional nighttime Halloween picnic, the Wonderland residents try to outspook each other with scary stories.</p>
