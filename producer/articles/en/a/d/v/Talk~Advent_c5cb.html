<p>"In the Roman Catholic Church, Advent begins on the fourth Sunday before Christmas..." Wouldn't it be better to say: "In the Western Church, Advent begins on the fourth Sunday before Christmas" here? Advent is observed in churches (Anglican, Lutheran, many Methodist churches among them) other than the Roman Catholic Church and it begins within those other churches on the fourth Sunday before Christmas. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrumpykansan_4648.html" title="User:Grumpykansan">User:Grumpykansan</a> 10:36, 4 Nov 2005</p>
<p>"A few non-liturgical Christians, or Catholics for whom different coloured candles are unavailable, use red candles for the four Sundays." Its actually very traditional to use red candles in Germany, at home as well as in church. People do use other colours (purple, blue, rose or wahtever), bur for simple reasons of style and taste ("Matches my curtains"). Coming from a lutheran protestant church, I don´t really know if its the same in the catholic church - although all my catholic friends have red-candle-wreaths. Coming to the point: The candle-colour is definitely not bound to the question wether the church follows a liturgy or not. At least not everywhere.</p>

<p>Has anyone found a bond between Advent and John the Baptist? John the Baptist gave us a pathway out of the wilderness through a baptism of repentance. He revealed the universal alternative, the One who would baptize with the Holy Spirit. What does this have in common with Advent? Mike81859 04:20, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Traditionally, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_the_Baptist_0931.html" title="John the Baptist">John the Baptist</a> features prominently in the gospel readings, hymns and prayers of Advent. His Advent role is that of <i>forerunner</i>, preparing the way for the Messiah. This ties in also with the focus on the baptism of Jesus celebrated in Epiphany. --<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 17:56, 7 December 2005 (UTC)]]</dd>

<p>Well, Advent is a time of preparation and penitence, and J the B is known for "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand!" Which is tailor-made for Advent. (unsigned <a href="../../../c/f/o/User%7ECfortunato_1679.html" title="User:Cfortunato">User:Cfortunato</a>)</p>

<p>How universal is the order of the themes of Advent? From looking at the advent related pages, there seems to be a statement of the same order every year, universally followed. Yet, this isn't always true. for example. Community of Christ advent 2006 Year C advent theme order is Peace, Hope, Love, Joy. For Advent 2005, Year B it was Hope, Peace, Joy, Love,and next year, Year A 2007, it will be Peace, Hope, Joy, Love. Is Community of Christ unique in the order changing or are their other Christian tradtions which use a different order?</p>

<p>The part about blue coming from the Sarum rite appears to be false:</p>
<p><a href="http://cantuar.blogspot.com/2005/12/liturgical-colors-in-sarum-rite.html" class="external free" title="http://cantuar.blogspot.com/2005/12/liturgical-colors-in-sarum-rite.html" rel="nofollow">http://cantuar.blogspot.com/2005/12/liturgical-colors-in-sarum-rite.html</a></p>
<p>The Sarum Rite color for Advent was black, not blue.]]</p>
<p>The confusion comes from the fact that the color is called "Sarum Blue." But WHY is it called Sarum Blue? Supposedly, it originated in Salisbury Cathedral, and Salisbury's ancient name was "Sarum." It's still called that. It's also the tradition color in the West of the garb of the Virgin Mary (She wears red in Eastern Art - and odd distinction between Eastern and Western Christianity.)

<p>The cantuar.blogspot.com article (Fr. Taylor Marshall) is mistaken in equating the Use of Lichfield with that of Sarum. I covered the issue here: <a href="http://orthodox-okie.blogspot.com/2005/12/sarum-blue-and-advent.html" class="external free" title="http://orthodox-okie.blogspot.com/2005/12/sarum-blue-and-advent.html" rel="nofollow">http://orthodox-okie.blogspot.com/2005/12/sarum-blue-and-advent.html</a> The Sarum Rite color for Advent was violet, which in terms of Medieval terminology is what we would call a 'dark blue' today. Black was also the Advent color for York, however - there was not a uniformity of Uses, and Sarum did not follow that of Lichfield or York, and it was Sarum's use that came to preeminence over the British Empire. <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAristibule_8d3e.html" title="User:Aristibule">Aristibule</a> 08:05, 11 January 2006.</p>

<p>How can links to Fish Eaters be "spam"? americancatholic.org - run by St. Anthony Messenger Press, a private company -- is linked to repeatedly. (Same with catholic.com, another private company) Wikipedia is their second biggest referrer according to Alexa (same with catholic.com). Where else will you get the information at the Lent section of that site you keep taking down? What is the deal here?

<p>I completely agree with Malachias, and I'm the sort of liberal he probably wouldn't have much use for.&#160;:). Fish Eaters is not just a legitimate site - it's a major liturgical resource.

<dd>Fisheaters has been prolifically linkspammed into Wikipedia. Before Christmas I removed it from over a hundred articles. As far as I can tell it has no provable authority. I asked about that on the traditionalist catholic article and got lots of arm-waving and no hard evidence - I am ill-disposed to give linkspammers a free pass, especially since the "one or two" areticles which some suggested might be appropriate has once again as of this evening turned into rather a lot more than one or two. The "traditionalist catholic" viewpoint is pretty much 100% irrelevant to a general article on Advent. Malachias knows my view on all this. - <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JzG_1e67.html" title="Special:Contributions/JzG">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> <i><a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_AfD_78f4.html" title="User:JzG/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 01:20, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
