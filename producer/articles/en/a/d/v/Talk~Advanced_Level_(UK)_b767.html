<p>Since the A level is common throughout the Commonwealth, shouldn't they receive something approaching as thorough a treatment as the type awarded in England, Wales and NI? What about noting that many students all over the world, especially in private education, actually take the <i>British</i> A-level? --<a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaEmilyDavies_9249.html" title="User:VivaEmilyDavies">VivaEmilyDavies</a> 23:56, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yup... but often countries like Singapore, although doing the 'A' Levels offered by UCLES, have different syllabus. The Ministry of Education of Sinagpore has more control over the content, while Cambridge sets and marks the papers. Wonder if anyone can wrap that up nicely...

<p>"While many universities do not consider an A-level in General Studies to be a stand-alone subject (and thus is not accepted as part of an offer), it may affect the offer which a student receives exclusive of it. For example, a student of maths, physics and computing might receive an offer "BBC" for a physics degree, whereas one also taking General Studies would receive "BCC". That said, if the student gets a C in General Studies, and B-C-D in their other three, regardless of the second C, they would have failed to reach the conditions of their offer, and thus lose that place." - is there <i>any</i> evidence for this? It is not part of the stated policies of any university that I am aware of. And it does need some rephrasing - it isn't that most universities don't accept that it's a valid A-level subject, just that it's not the type of qualification that they want to base offers on. Many would encourage students to take it anyway for knowledge-broadening purposes. I have heard anecdotes of GS being taken into account at the Clearing stage of university admissions. --<a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaEmilyDavies_9249.html" title="User:VivaEmilyDavies">VivaEmilyDavies</a> 23:49, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I feel that this section has become too unwieldly. As the subject is A level, not university admission, perhaps it should be spun off onto a more relevant or new article? There seems to be an assumption that A levels are only taken as a means to entry to a under graduate university course, which is clearly false. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkb_3e6f.html" title="User:Markb">Markb</a> 09:48, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have removed links to AS and A2 levels (pages which don't currently exist).

Otherwise, people have no impediment to creating new pages on those topics. Pages that talk about AS-levels or A2-levels specifically should link to whichever one they are talking about (we don't know where the content on AS-levels and A2-levels will end up eventually), but the redirect will take them to this article.

<p>they still existed as least as late as 1999 when I did them but they we not widely taken</p>
<p>They still exist in Singapore, but only until November 2006 (I am taking Chem and Bio this week&#160;:( ). After that the 'A' Level system in Singapore will be revamped. I wonder how come there's no history on it and I just see the AEA popping up from nowhere? Richardlu yy 15:15, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"A third view is that, as schools come under increasing pressure to improve their examination results, pupils are being coached to pass specific examinations, at the expense of a general understanding of their subjects. "</p>
<p>Bloody right. As a student just finishing my alevels now it infuriates me how little some of my class mates actually understand the subject yet manage to get the top grades. On the other hand there as some other guys with a clear talent for a subject and much more practical ability, yet they always seem to miss top marks. Doesnt seem very fair to me.

<p>The paragraph appended to the end of this page...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Breadth of knowledge has already been satisfied, following 10-years of education (6-16 years of age), the taking of, on average 7 GCSE's (6-8). By this time, people should know how to read and write, have extensively completed english language and literature and other subjects. A-levels are a specialization (hence the depth) in preparation for a further specialization at University. Unlike the US University system, that repeats 70+% of prior learning from high school, of which, a major that accounts for only 40-50% of the degree, the remainder 50-60% has absolutely nothing to do with the degree title and is just a repeat of high school, the UK degree is 4-years at 90-100% of in depth education in the specialization. This is more like the US masters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...seems a bit inflammatory, isn't sourced (70%+?), and doesn't necessarily add anything to the page. A bit about (or a link to) the GCSE's and breadth might be okay, but the paragraph as a whole is inappropriate IMO. Anyone else have any thoughts on this?</p>

<p>I have heard that people who correct and grade the A-Levels don't know the names of the pupils so bias regarding ethnicity or gender can't influence the grading. As I'm not sure whether this is true or not, I did not change the entry, so please do so if you know this to be correct.</p>

<p>"or multiple Sciences and Mathematics courses, which can have overlapping content" Can anyone find a reference for this? I cannot speak certainly for science A-levels, but certainly my experience of learning two mathematics A-levels is that the content does not overlap significantly (althought the second a-level does build on the first one) and that doing the second a-level takes at least the same amount of work as the first if not more. 86.137.104.235 17:21, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>I think that your comment about it building on the content is fair - it's not the same work repeated, but twice as much work at the same level if you do Maths and Further Maths for example. There is a choice of 17 modules, you would take 3 to do an AS level and another three to complete the A Level. In Further Maths you do another three or six.</i></p>
<p>There are some cases in which they do overlap, and not just science and mathematics. Also, I believe that the article is referring to an overlap in mathematics and science rather than Maths and Further Maths (which, really, wouldn't, by definition, overlap) - I know that physics and mechanics overlap (although as I am doing a statistics module and every core science except physics ... take with a pinch of salt) - and I'd imagine there're other overlaps in other subjects. English Literature would likely overlap with Drama (I only do English Lit, so I can't say for sure), Lit and Lang would probably overlap, biology and geography - maybe, I know that IT overlaps with Law (again, I don't do law, but as there's a section of the IT course dedicated specifically to laws on computers...) - in short, there are a lot of overlaps. Not that that's a particularly bad thing. LupusCanis 17:39, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have 4 and a half hours a week for each subject (I take four AS). 3 an hour long, with one lesson being half an hour more. That makes 18 hours a week, plus 2 more for IT/General Studies and also for Tutorial.

<dd>Yes, it is, I do the same. 4.5hrs per lesson (in 2x1hr, 1x1hr15, 1x1h30 (reduced to 1hr15 except in cases of practical lab sessions). Plus 1hr15 worth of tutorials (1x45mins, 1x30mins). Just proof that it's standard, as for A2 it changes I think, think you get one double block per subject/per week. So in principal ive got 18hrs of lessons, with the possibility of an extra 15mins per block (College's name for periods), 1hr15 of tutor (though it rarely comes to that) and 14hrs15mins free blocks. Some of my circle of friends also do another 4hr30 per block, losing 4hrs45 of free blocks.

<dd>Plenty of things here aren't encyclopedic. It wouldn't be a bad idea in my opinion. <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkinnyweed_5519.html" title="User:Skinnyweed">Skinnyweed</a> 14:37, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have made a Demographics section that has results and things like that, it's quite a mess of statistics. I've also changed the name of "questions of academic rigour" to "criticisms and reformation" as it covers it better, and added some stuff there. <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkinnyweed_5519.html" title="User:Skinnyweed">Skinnyweed</a> 15:45, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Concerning the subjects list, every single subject must have a source to an exam board otherwise it may be removed. I have started this process by adding the AQA Specifications document which sources the most common ones. <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkinnyweed_5519.html" title="User:Skinnyweed">Skinnyweed</a> 22:20, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This article needs a thorough copyedit, for instance, the first paragraph says <i>qualification, usually taken by students</i>, only a few words later it repeats itself with <i>qualification taken by students</i>. <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkinnyweed_5519.html" title="User:Skinnyweed">Skinnyweed</a> 22:29, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But it does still have the influence of the Commonwealth in it's culture, as shown by the fact that HK has A-Levels.

<p>This article requires some refractoring, some graphs (for the grades like on the <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Certificate_of_Secondary_Education_aa53.html" title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">GCSE</a> article), and just general cleanup, because it's not very clear. Hence, added the tag. (<a href="../../../b/t/i/User%7EBtipling_4d9e.html" title="User:Btipling">Bjorn Tipling</a> 18:57, 21 August 2006 (UTC))</p>

<p>it says in the article that a levels are used in former british colonies, and ireland was a british colony.</p>
<p>Ireland isn't really a British colony - the Republic of Ireland is very distinct from United Kingdom. Ireland has the Irish Leaving Certificate (I think). Michael Ly 11:49, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>-read carefully. no one is saying ireland is a british colony. it WAS one. it was also a member of the commonwealth.</p>
