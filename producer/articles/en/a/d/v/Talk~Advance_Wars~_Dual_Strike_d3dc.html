<p>This merely says that a game with this title will be released by Nintendo next year. It does say that Nintendo says nothing else about it, it doesn't manage to present any other information specific to the new product. Now, while I don't see why every commercial product with a fanbase deserves its own page, I do understand that there are arguments for this that aren't necessarily absurd. I can also understand that a long-expected and long-discussed product of some importance that doesn't yet actually exist (e.g. Microsoft's "Longhorn") <i>might</i> deserve an article. But there's no sign that this as-yet non-existent game is in any way significant.

This is fundamentally the same standard which leads us to delete personal vanity articles, CDs by garage bands, individual buildings which show no cultural or historical significance, blogs, etc. I'm not arguing that the game must become a best-seller.

<li>Surely being part of an already successful video game series achieves those criteria. I mean, it's not as though one releases a console game out of one's garage.

<p>Someone ought to incorporate the list of Dual Strikes into the article - I would but I'm not entirely sure about the best way to do it.

<dl>
<dd>Hm. At any rate, we still need more in the CO section. Perhaps something like the first few COs in the <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advance_Wars_2_f66b.html" title="Advance Wars 2">Advance Wars 2</a> article, though it probably won't happen for a while. (<a href="../../../p/a/p/User%7EPaper_Snifit_d9ba.html" title="User:Paper Snifit">Paper Snifit</a>)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I also think that Tag Powers ought to be incorporated into the article - though I'm not sure what a good way to do this would be. By the way, what exactly is "Blue Daze"? Colin and Sahsa'a Tag Power is "Trust Funds".</p>
<p>I vote for making a Wikibook with subpages like "CO Guide" and "Dual Strike Guide." I plan on getting this game soon, so I might be able to contribute to a possible Advance Wars: Dual Strike module. On an expansion note, there should be more on the gameplay, as well as the new Combat mode, which I'm about to write about (I got a demo of the game from a friend). --<a href="../../../g/a/k/User%7EGakon5_821a.html" title="User:Gakon5">gakon<sup>5</sup></a> <a href="../../../g/a/k/User_talk%7EGakon5_4f71.html" title="User talk:Gakon5">(talk)</a></p>

<p>I added a new section on Gameplay and on the new Combat mode, as well as the transmitable demos. I based all this writing solely on what I know about the game; I based the Combat and Demo sections on the demo I have on my DS. Someone who owns the game could probably expand more on this. Also, that list of new features restates some information I wrote, so some of it may need to be filtered out (plus, half the article is a big list). --<a href="../../../g/a/k/User%7EGakon5_821a.html" title="User:Gakon5">gakon<sup>5</sup></a> <a href="../../../g/a/k/User_talk%7EGakon5_4f71.html" title="User talk:Gakon5">(talk)</a></p>

<p>This article has been the target of vandalism by several IPs now &gt;_&lt; Anyways, I've expanded the article once more. First off, I've added a new section for the various game modes in <i>AWDS</i>; second, I removed the CO differences section; it's Wikibooks material, and could be transfered to a module for this game over there some time. I also removed the Game Differences section, as most all of it's contents are elsewhere in the article now. Lastly, I uploaded a screenshot to go with all that new text. Hope this was worthwhile... <a href="../../../g/a/k/User%7EGakon5_821a.html" title="User:Gakon5">gakon<sup>5</sup></a> <a href="../../../g/a/k/User_talk%7EGakon5_4f71.html" title="User talk:Gakon5">(talk)</a> 23:28, 28 September 2005 (UTC) (also, I think it's safe to say we can remove the Cleanup tag; does anyone else agree?)</p>

<p>In the Japanese version of the game, Grimm is known as Kouzou and Javier as Bittman. As such, the statement claiming that Grimm &amp; Javier's names have have been switched from the Japanese version has been deleted. Anyway, the point of this comment is to clear up confusion on the matter: Grimm (Yellow Comet) and Javier (Green Earth) have never had their names switched; however, After E3 2005 Nintendo mistakinly stated on their web site that Grimm was the Green Earth CO and Javier the Yellow Comet CO. <a href="../../../p/a/p/User_talk%7EPaper_Snifit_ceb5.html" title="User talk:Paper Snifit">(Paper Snifit)</a></p>

<p>This article was on the clean up list, so I took a stab at it. I reformatted many of the entries under "gameplay" and tried to take out some of the things that made it sound more like a FAQ or guide than an encylopedia entry. I'm still not sure if we need all of these detailed lists. I'm unsure about the list of reviews/ratings as well, does anyone have a good reason why they are there? This still needs a lot of work to make it an encyclopedia article rather than a FAQ, but hopefully this is a start. BCampbell 16:47, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, there should be three templates, one for each AW, as there are some caracteristics that are not shared (in example, COs had only one Power in AW --I think--, there are affiliations in AW:DS --the Tag level depending on how well each character carries on--, etc). The question is, which template to use if a character was in more than one game? -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 00:51, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

<p>When you start the console with AW:DS, and the GBA slot has the AW or AW2 cartridge, you get a couple of bonuses. In example, when you play with AW2 plugged in, you get <i>Sturm's Land</i> and <i>Lash's Land</i> maps, and <i>Advance Warpaper 2</i> wallpaper. If anyone is able to check the maps and wallpaper with AW, maybe we could add the information as an "Extra" section. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 02:05, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>In response to your edit summary, ReyBrujo, if we do not give the reasons why that site is included, then it sounds even more like advertising. Additionally, without the justification for inclusion, we merely look like we are being favoritist towards one site. The reason Advance Wars Net is being left up is because it is the oldest and presently the largest, shouldn't we say that's why? --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 15:44, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

If there's a list of products that gives just their names, and you add a product with a short blurb about how great it is, we'll all know why you did it.</i> Unluckily my summary was cut before finished, I was meaning that having an external link referenced as "the oldest" invites others to add their own links as their sites are "the most visited", "the most linked", "the most populated", "the most amount of articles", etc. Stating that it is the "largest" is a point of view, either by an editor or by the site itself.

<dd>No harm done. The bad thing about such words ("largest", "biggest", "most active", etc) is that they are based in a "snapshot" ("today we are the biggest"), while Wikipedia articles should be timeless (that is, there should be no need of continously checking whether the "snapshot" is still accurate or not). -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 16:14, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The choice to leave only Advance Wars Net as an unofficial was dubious and not explained.

<dd>Huh, wow, so that's what "Peacock Terms" are all about. Alright, I'll apologize for writing this page with that stuff; I would go through the article to remove-fix all instances of weasel words and peacock terms, if I had the time right now. Don't hesitate to do it for me, then! By the way, when I wrote the page, I did not own Dual Strike, so I think it was a bit of an instinct to use these terms when writing.
