<p>Don't forget Thunderbird. More information about new AMD64-cores are needed (Prosessor-roadmap in AMD's page)</p>
<p>There might be quite a bit of redundancy going on here, with both this article, the <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athlon.html" title="Athlon">Athlon</a> article, and the <a href="../../../a/m/d/AMD64_8952.html" title="AMD64">AMD64</a> describing the various processors in detail, where the Athlon article focuses on their processor series, and the AMD64 article focuses on the 64-bit "Hammer" series.</p>
<p>So, for example, to update this article with the release of Athlon 64 and Athlon FX, you need to update all three articles. It's understandable both the Athlon and AMD64 will need to, but the actual company article...?</p>
<p>My point is -- shouldn't this one mostly just cover the company profile of Advanced Micro Devices, with Related Links to Athlon and AMD64, and possibly other closely related articles? I'm asking before doing anything, because this could lead to some major changes in this article. (mostly abstractions, and the most detailed discussion of Athlon in particular perhaps being that it's one of their most well-known processor brands)</p>

<dd>I agree completely, actually, but deciding how to break out that sort of thing may be difficult. Perhaps a simple description of the company itself and a release timeline here, along with "Their most recent offerings have been the Athlon and the AMD64" with those properly Wikified . . . <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Bordelon_fa9e.html" title="User:Phil Bordelon">Phil Bordelon</a> 02:40, 1 Oct 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The AMD K5 and K6-x processors were not clones of the Intel Pentium, nor did they lack support for L2 cache. They were hybrid x86-RISC designs very much like the Athlon and Pentium 4 of today. Their only common ground with the Intel fifth-generation CPUs was the socket they went into. The K5, K6 and K6-2 all had their L2 cache on the motherboard, same as the Pentium, and the K6-III had 256K on the chip itself.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p>Should this page mention the thermal and mechanical problems that seemed to plague early versions of the Athlon? The infamous videotape on Tomshardware showing smoke curling up within seconds from Athlons when their heatsinks were removed did much to scare users away from AMD and back to Intel. And AMD certainly wasn't helped by the mechanically fragile and difficult-to-install Athlon package when Intel had already designed its Pentium 4 with a large and rugged copper heat sink and on-chip automatic thermal protection.</p>

<dd>Soon after Tom Pabst released this video, AMD released one that showed the exact opposite on their thunderbird parts. A demo person was able to run the latest Quake game for 10 minutes without a fan or heatsink on an Athlon. The truth is that the problems actually got a lot worse with the Athlon XP, where the CPUs could barely last a minute without a heatsink and functioning fan and would literally "fry". The reason this became a big issue was at the instigation of Intel, because while their contemporary P4 processor used roughly the same, and sometimes even more power, but they had a solution to the overheating problem. The P4 would self-detect the overheating condition and drop its clock rate precipitously to keep it from burning itself alive. I'm not sure if AMD ever did add in on-chip technology to do this, but very soon afterwards motherboards started adding technology that did this. So the Virtual Gorilla keeps marching on ... <a href="../../../q/e/d/User%7EQed_d487.html" title="User:Qed">Qed</a> 14:00, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You can't be serious. No microprocessor in this generation from either Intel or AMD will survive without a heatsink. In fact, Intel's P4 often runs hotter than AMD offerings. So yes, if you weren't being sarcastic, current chips will all be destroyed within moments of removing the heat sink.</p>

<p>The AMD Elan SC520 chips (which represent the entire Elan line), as well as the Am186 Series get no mention here.</p>

<p><a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInter_454c.html" title="User:Inter">Inter</a> and I have begun to discuss improving the swarm of AMD-related pages. He suggested that we stage the conversation here. Perhaps others will join and help?</p>
<p>I was going to build myself an new server and I wanted to use an AMD chip. So, of course, I turned first to the Wikipedia for background.</p>
<p>There is a lot of information, but I found it quite chaotic and inconsistent. And, frankly, much of it wasn't up to the Wiki standards we might aspire to.</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's typical.&#160;;-) When many different editors make edits to the same articles in the same category, there's bound to be a heap of inconsistencies. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInter_454c.html" title="User:Inter">Inter</a> 10:17, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I'd suggest to move some of these pages, especially the <a href="../../../d/u/r/Duron.html" title="Duron">Duron</a>, <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athlon_64.html" title="Athlon 64">Athlon 64</a>, <a href="../../../a/m/d/AMD64_8952.html" title="AMD64">AMD64</a> and <a href="../../../a/m/d/AMD_Opteron_9996.html" title="AMD Opteron">AMD Opteron</a>. Some of this can almost certainly be merged with something else. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInter_454c.html" title="User:Inter">Inter</a> 10:17, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Some of these — for example <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_AMD_Opteron_microprocessors_407f.html" title="List of AMD Opteron microprocessors">List of AMD Opteron microprocessors</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_AMD_Opteron_models_4e0a.html" title="List of AMD Opteron models">List of AMD Opteron models</a> — point to the same place through redirects. But it would be nice to get a consistent structure.</p>
<p>And speaking of consistency, some pages that I think ought be look pretty much alike — for example <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_AMD_Athlon_microprocessors_ba40.html" title="List of AMD Athlon microprocessors">List of AMD Athlon microprocessors</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_AMD_Opteron_microprocessors_407f.html" title="List of AMD Opteron microprocessors">List of AMD Opteron microprocessors</a> — look really different. I'm not a Double-E, so I can't say for certain that this is wrong, but it certainly looks wrong.</p>
<dl>
<dd>In the spirit of consistency they should look more alike. If all of them have the same structure it looks better. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInter_454c.html" title="User:Inter">Inter</a> 10:17, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>And lots of techno-babble words aren't defined, directly or by link. Look, for example, at the table headings in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_AMD_Athlon_microprocessors_ba40.html" title="List of AMD Athlon microprocessors">List of AMD Athlon microprocessors</a>. I happen to know what an FSB, but the table needs a <a href="../../../f/r/o/Front_side_bus.html" title="Front side bus">link</a> to explain it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Easily fixable. There are probably other words in the tables which should link to other articles aswell. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInter_454c.html" title="User:Inter">Inter</a> 10:17, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I've done some clean up (you can find my fingerprints here and there), but I'd guess I've done 5% of the work that might be done. So as a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html#Decision_making" title="Straw man">straw-man proposal</a>, I'm suggesting this structure to all of the articles:</p>
<ol>
<li>AMD (this article). About the company and it's history.</li>
<li>List of AMD microprocessors. Just an outline of the history of AMD's technical CPU offerings
<ol>
<li>AMD Athlon. About the chip family: what makes it cool, different. Why is an Athlon XP like an Athlon 64 (there must be some reason they have the same name).
<ol>
<li>List of AMD Athlon microprocessors. Every Athlon model every made, with interesting information about it.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>AMD Opteron. <code>:.-1 s/Athlon/Opteron/g</code> <b>&lt;-- vi joke &#160;:-)</b>
<ol>
<li>List of AMD Opteron microprocessors. Same vi joke.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>AMD Duron. Ditto.</li>
<li>Et cetera.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>List of AMD slots and sockets
<ol>
<li>Slot A. What makes it cool, different, etc.</li>
<li>Socket 940. And again</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>OK. The AMD article should list every other AMD article. That is, to have one point of departure in the AMD article hierarchy I propose the main AMD page to be the staging point. I realize that the <b>See Also</b> section can get fairly crowded, hence my merge suggestion above. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInter_454c.html" title="User:Inter">Inter</a> 10:17, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The <i>AMD Athlon</i> article might link upward to <i>List of AMD microprocessors</i> and link downward to <i>List of AMD Athlon microprocessors</i>, but not all over the place to Opteron and Duron and so on articles (I was getting really lost the first time I went through, so I'm proposing a strict hierarchy to make it easier to remember where you are).</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, the articles shouldn't link all over the place but in the spirit of WP they can link anywhere they like. If we do it <i>in</i> the text, it's fine, but having a large <b>See Also</b> section on every single article might not be so desireable. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInter_454c.html" title="User:Inter">Inter</a> 10:17, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Oh, and all of the <i>List of AMD &lt;mumble&gt; microprocessors</i> article would look alike, to the extent that it is possible to do that.</p>
<p>It's easy to see how we ended up where we are: smart people just adding stuff as it came to them. It's the Wiki-way, and thank all the Wiki-gods for it. But maybe it's time to step back and organize it.</p>
<p>As a place to start:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dt>What should a <b>List of AMD &lt;mumble&gt; microprocessors</b> page look like? Are all the table headings in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_AMD_Athlon_XP_microprocessors_385e.html" title="List of AMD Athlon XP microprocessors">List of AMD Athlon XP microprocessors</a> to many? Are the table headings in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_AMD_Opteron_microprocessors_407f.html" title="List of AMD Opteron microprocessors">List of AMD Opteron microprocessors</a> too few? I'd be inclined (another straw-man) toward</dt>
</dl>

<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Model number</li>
<li>Frequency</li>
<li>Multiplier (whatever that is)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>A CPU multiplier is simply the number of times the FSB speed should be multiplied. Say if you have an FSB speed of 133 and a multiplier of 10. That gives you a CPU core speed of 1.33Ghz. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInter_454c.html" title="User:Inter">Inter</a> 10:17, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Flash History Missing</span></h2>
<p>Alright, I've now fixed the whole article. It talks about the technology from the point of view of how and why it was important in the corporate history of AMD, rather than providing spec sheets. I've also added a section of AMD's flash business, which was a massive omission. It would still benefit from some tidy up, but I think you now get a much better feel for what AMD is about, and how they company developed. But we could do with more pre-1990 stuff now. 1970 odd to 1990 is thread bare. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimharwoodx_16da.html" title="User:Timharwoodx">Timharwoodx</a> 18:20, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article has various grammatical issues, ranging from minor to severe. There are instances where commas are inserted unnecessarily, adverbs are carelessly strung onto sentences, and there are phrases that just don't make a lot of sense. The article needs to be audited for its grammar.—<a href="../../../k/b/o/User%7EKbolino_eb99.html" title="User:Kbolino">Kbolino</a> 05:43, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I wrote most of it, and all the language tests I've done typically put me in the top 1-2% of the population. Writing is as much about style, as applying strict rules. Even the Oxford University grammar guidelines now state that split infinitives can be accepted in certain contexts for stylistic reasons i.e. even world experts on English say there is more to good writing than typing like a grammar robot. As for not making sense, if you don't know anything about technology, thats not really my problem. The page is written in relatively simple laymen terms. Its hardly technical. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimharwoodx_16da.html" title="User:Timharwoodx">Timharwoodx</a> 23:06, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Missing history, missing products, missing concept</span></h2>
<p>this article is good within the limited scope the author has staked out but IMHO falls a bit short as a general history of the firm. the article concentrates mostly on AMD's history as a second source of intel processors, and treats the recent intel-beaters as mearly an outgroath of that relationship. i have a different take on the story. i see amd as an independant processor designer that became a second source for the intel x86 line and over time learned to gain market acceptance for it's own internal architecture by accepting the x86 instruction set as input. a lingua franca for processors, if you will.</p>
<p>as noted in another comment the 2900 series is missing. what falls by the way side with it is the more general notion that AMD was a respected semiconductor firm with a history of quality in house design before they started second sourcing x86 chips. (as noted in another wikipedia article, am2900 products were used in the PDP-11.)</p>
<p>there is no mention of am29K processor in the article per se, even though there is a wikipedia article on it which is linked to at the end of this article. the am29K was an important product for AMD. during it's production lifetime it was one of the most successful risc processors.</p>
<p>the acquisition of nextgen and nextgen's contribution to the AMD product line is given some attention, but a major concept is missing from the treatment.</p>
<p>to the best of my recollection (and i'll admit it's been a while) nextgen's processor understood x86 instructions but used a different internal architecture. it translated on the fly. they're internal architecture wasn't fast enough to do that translation plus it's own work and still yeild the kind of performance needed to win broad market acceptance. they're processor did not take the world by storm, but they had a powerfull idea and experience implementing it.</p>
<p>AMD had experience with the x86 instruction set. they also had a very fast, cheap processor with it's own instruction set that was limited to niche markets because of the installed base of x86 software. what nextgen brought to the party was a way of putting those things together.</p>
<p>as described in the wikipedia K5 article, internally the AMD K series processors in large part constited of sections of the 29K. nextgen style technology was used to translate the x86 instruction set. this time the internal architecture was fast enough to handle the translation and provide a performance gain on top of it.</p>
<p>the rest, as they say, is history. AMD gained flexibility in design was not restricted to simply cloning another vendors product.</p>
<p>Nextgen and AMD transformed the published x86 instruction set from simply the instruction set of a particular processor family to a generalized interface to processors of various designs. since then other vendors have used it this way including national semiconducton, transmeta and via.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">wasn't there a compatability issue with early K series CPUs?</span></h2>
<p>i may be wrong about this, but i seem to recall that at the time of the release of the early K chips some popular commercial had exploited undocumented intel x86 features. the K chips which only supported the published spec didn't run this stuff (and i've forgotten what it was) reliably.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is highly unlikely. When AMD reverse engineered that Intel instruction set, they did not just go with what was documented. They did complete pin signal level reverse engineering, as well as a lot of software reverse engineering to figure out the entire instruction tree of the Pentium family of CPUs. So AMD was fully aware of even the undocumented instructions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Starting with the P6 family however, Intel introduced the concept of "MSRs" or "model specific registers" which are not feasible to fully reverse engineer (there are 4 billion of them, and each may be associated with an internal state machine of arbitrary complexity.) Fortunately, the architectural specification of these registers state that their meaning may change with processor version and that general software should *NOT* rely on their consistent definition -- i.e., only Operating Systems, drivers and special tools should ever use them. Nevertheless in the Athlon, AMD implemented the special "performance monitoring" MSRs as well as write combining and certain cache control MSRs which were either documented, or exposed by software which AMD was able to reverse engineer. In real software, however, there should not be any noticed discrepancy because of MSR usage.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Another issue, however, was performance of certain instructions. The AMD K6 had an extremely fast "LOOP" instruction. Unfortunately, some poorly written Ethernet drivers used to use this instruction for a predictable delay in speed. As such, Intel had been actually slowing down the relative clock through of this instruction over time, so that its overall speed was roughly constant so that this software continued to work. AMD did no such thing, and when their processors hit 332.5 Mhz all of a sudden these Ethernet drivers started to fail badly. Microsoft eventually issued a path, and future revisions of AMD CPUs were forced to slow down the LOOP instruction just like Intel did. I don't know if they continued this in the K8 line of CPUs.</dd>
</dl>
<p>however, free software also written to published specs ran fine, which made the AMD processors the darlings of the free software world, as they worked fine and were cheap. so AMD may have gotten a big boost from bsd, linux, etc.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think both AMD and Intel CPUs work just fine with "free software". AMD's CPUs tend to be *cheaper* which is probably the *real* reason it was considered a darling of the free software world.</dd>
</dl>
<p>i'm really not sure if this is factual or just a nice story, but it would be nice if someone could check it out. if it's correct it probably belongs in the article as it demonstrates the way standards adhearance affects the market.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Remember, that in a sense, Intel used to *set* the standard, and that included the documentation. However, this has generally been a minor issue with AMD CPUs as their implementations always tended to be extremely close to Intel's standard. (Certainly far closer than Cyrix, or other clone makers.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think that what may be coming to mind was the K6 issue with Windows 95. There was a "software timing loop" issue in certain versions of Windows 95 that caused windows protection errors (and spontaneous system lockup/no boot) due to the high clock speeds used by AMD in the K6-2/350 and up processors.

<p>Is this really true?</p>
<dl>
<dd>This definition began to be applied more loosely over time as AMD struggled to compete with the ramping clock speeds of the Northwood core (&gt;3.0 GHz). The credibility of the scheme was only saved by the arrival of the K8, where model numbers once again correlated more reasonably to actual performance.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I've generally followed the processor market fairly closely. I distinctly remember someone (either Anand or Tom I believe) claiming that one or more of the high rated Athlons did no deserve their rating. IIRC AMD responded and said that the PR rating was given based on their performance via a published set of benchmarks. If this was true, and the Athlon really did deserve whatever rating based on these published benchmarks, then this line clearly needs to go. We can make it clear that it was difficult for AMD to compete against the higher end of Intel's performance of course <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 15:55, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well hang on -- they were, and always have been, AMD's chosen set of benchmarks. I think that the general sentiment at the time was that AMD had been pushing it a little with the last of the K7 line. You should not automatically take the AMD corporate line over Tom or Anand. You may wish to edit this to claim that it was "disputed", but I don't think its easy to claim that its wrong.</dd>

<p>I removed the following statement</p>
<dl>
<dd>The easy cooperation by these companies is an early indication of the weakness of this case, and it remains to be seen how far AMD will go when the first hearing is in 2008.</dd>
</dl>
<p>It is unsourced POV. Normally I would tag it with a citation needed but in this case, I removed it because I feel it's a bit weak. I'm not a legal expert but I see no reason to assume the cooperation gives an indication of the weakness of the case. The companies subpoened are not under any legal threat/risk at the moment as the case is against Intel. While a successful lawsuit could potentially damage any relationship they have with Intel and their cooperation could make Intel angry, it's rather difficult IMHO to say for sure what these companies would do. On the face of it, it makes most sense for them not to cooperate too much, but not to be too resistant either. Why annoy either AMD or Intel? But it depends a lot on the circumstances. The companies might not be pleased about losing their rebates etc, but they probably don't like the threats. Also, they might feel they might put themselves at greater risk from either AMD or various governments if they don't cooperate so they might see no reason to put themselves at such risk for Intel (and if Intel tried to harm or blackmail them because of the lawsuit, they could retialiate by giving this info to AMD). Some of the companies might want to send Intel a message by cooperating. Others (e.g. Microsoft) may find themselves more favouring AMD at the moment. Point being, it's rather difficult IMHO to gauge what the cooperation of these companies means. If it were Intel themselves, then we could assume if they we cooperating easily it might indicate they don't think there is any case. But since it's about third parties who are not at direct risk, from the lawsuit, it's rather difficult to say what they cooperation entails. With a reference from some legal source, preferbly one who isn't know to always favour Intel for whatever reason (although even one who does always favour Intel would be acceptable of course) <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 16:24, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This sounds like marketing material. "Productivity?" Let's keep the article relavant to AMD: the company and products.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AMD has also formed a strategic partnership with IBM, under which AMD gained silicon on insulator (SOI) manufacturing technology, and detailed advice on 90-nm implementation.

<p>This statement couldn't be more wrong. Funny how there is no source given. Companies make dubious claims about their process technology. It certainly is not a fact that SOI offers better power consumption in practice than CMOS. If anything, the jury is still out.</p>
<p><b>Answer</b>: you may not like it, but it is a fact that SOI offers better power consumption. The reason for that is that SOI reduces transistor leakage, and if less energy is leaked, less power is consumed... simple as that. The reduced leakage also enables the transitors to be packed more closely together inside the chip. In practice, manufacturers use the "liberated" space to pack EVEN MORE TRANSISTORS into the chip. The result is that the overall power consumption of an SOI processor may look similar to that of a regular processor, but the performance is quite different (more transistors = better performance). As for references, you can access the specifications of any processor that use SOI technology (I, for instance, found all the information on SOI at the APPLE website in their documentation of the PowerPC processor)</p>

<p>Unlike some other companies, AMD provided the technical details required for the open source BIOS project LinuxBIOS</p>

<p>What other companies? What technical details?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Again, innovation is key to AMD's "Virtual Gorilla" corporate strategy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why not include the phone number for the AMD US sales office after this sentence? This may or may not be true, but it reeks of bias and a poor encylopedia article.</p>

<dd>Agree with everything here. I made a preliminary attempt to rewrite the K6 and K7 sections (which were particularly offensive in an autobiographical self-aggrandizement way). MORE WORK IS NEEDED. Falcomadol 16:31, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with most all the sentiments expressed on this talk page. A firm supporter and devoted customer of AMD, I find that the inaccuracy, bias, and poor organization of the AMD articles hurts the company's image. I fully support a rewrite, and should I find something of value, I will outline it on this page for review.</p>
<p>Just as a suggestion, does anybody know of a benchmark comparison between Intel's Core 2 Duo line and AMD's Athlon 64 X2 series? AMD's website has benchmark comparisons featuring Pentium D processors, but not the new Intel dual core models. Information from such a benchmark test might be relevant in the article on the X2 AMD processors. They Call Me Dick 08:16, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Re-Write Outline</span></h2>
<p>It's pretty clear that the AMD article currently reflects the execution level of its ATi subsidiary (that is to say, it sucks). In pursuit of making the article...acceptable, I propose we follow this outline. I have not begun work on any section of the outline, (though will commence so after the holiday) - feel free to modify the outline, or take a section to write. For now, I suggest we try to keep it to one person per section, as the "I have interesting fact X about AMD, so I'll stick it in random section Y" strategy is pretty much what got us here in the first place.</p>
<p>For now, I recommend we keep the ATI information in a seperate article - ATI operates currently as a wholly owned subsidiary, not a division of AMD. I suggest we keep the ATI article and make it abundantly clear they are "green team" - and make appropriate lateral references in the AMD article.</p>
<p>I. Introduction:</p>
<pre>
   a) Brief explanation of AMD (Name, company, founded date, primary business (semiconductor manufacturing)
   b) Vital Statistics Box
</pre>
<p>II. History</p>
<pre>
   a) Founding of AMD
         i) Founders - JS III, et al - date, circumstances
         ii) Initial Products
         iii) Company philosophy and presence in the market place
   b) "Formative Era"
         i) AMD becomes a supplier of Intel "cloned" chips (reasons for doing so, and the circumstances therein)
         ii) The begging of legal troubles with Intel (brief mention of Intel transitioning from "needing" AMD to protecting their IP, not a lot of detail here
   c) Transition
         i) AMD begins to step out of the x86 "mold"
         ii) Production woes begun to stunt AMD's growth and ability to compete
         iii) The x86 Patent Settlement
   d) Techonologically Competitve
         i) Architechtural decisions that lead to technological leadership
         ii) How technological leadership became irrelevant in the face of competition
         iii) Spinoff of Spansion
   e) A Market Leader
         i) The release of the K8 signals a new direction and unification of AMD's Strategy
         ii) Intel Anti-trust suit
         iii) Purchase of ATI
</pre>
<p>III. Technology (This section is a simple breakdown of AMD's technology and pace of advancement - detail is to be found in other articles)</p>
<pre>
   a) Early Years (cloner)
   b) Undertaking Independent Designs
   c) K-era
   d) K7 and the 'marketing of technology' (K becomes Athlong)
   e) K8 - take industry leadership
   f) Opteron (Compete beyond the package - HT, ccHT)
   g) Launch of Platform Initiatives (Torrenza, the AMD Chipset business, AMD Live)
   h) Looking Ahead (K8L, Fusion, K10)
</pre>
<p>IV. Manufacturing</p>
<pre>
   a) Manufacturing Introduction
        i) Structure of AMD's manufacturing capacity
        ii) Overlook of AMD's manufacturing technology (currently 65nm 300mm SOI process) and planned process technology
   b) History
        i) Initial Production (sublet)
        ii) Desire to compete on the "grand scale" leads to pursuit of "fabs" (Jerry Sanders Quote Here)
        iii) Establishment of First Production Facilities
        iv) Pursuit of Production Technology Leadership through Partnerships (IBM)
        v) Production Future (Fab 38, Fab 36, fab 4x (luther hills))
   c) Problems
        i) Financial Proposition (Intel 100bil. market cap v. AMD 10 bil. Market cap - same number of fabs needed)
        ii) Execution Failures (Late process shrinks, fab engineers unable to execute Architecture at the same level as the competition)
        iii) Sales growth faster than Production Growth
   d) The Chartered Solution
        i) Relationship with Chartered and UMC
        ii) ATI's affect on relationship in the future

<li>Something still not solved, what about <i>other products</i> (e.g. <a href="../../../a/m/d/AMD_Live%21_bbef.html" title="AMD Live!">AMD Live!</a>) and initiatives having codenames only (e.g. <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torrenza.html" title="Torrenza">Torrenza</a>, AMD Trinity etc.) away from CPU itself, though AMD is mainly a CPU making company now.

<li>P.S. Don't forget to mention AMD64 and TSMC.</li>
<li>P.S.2 I think you should provide something about "Spansion" and then its spin off. --<a href="../../../2/0/2/User%7E202.71.240.18.html" title="User:202.71.240.18">202.71.240.18</a> 08:29, 23 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree that there is some material missing, but I think, given the breadth of material in the form of other articles available (on AMD 64, on HT, on AMD Live etc.) - this article is about a public company, it should be structured more like ...an entry in the factbook for a country. In fact, I think we should add a section on a financial performance, but I am not sure if we can a) get that information or b) manage it effectively. I've made some small changes based on your feedback.<a href="../../../s/a/h/User%7ESahrin_7e60.html" title="User:Sahrin">Sahrin</a> 14:43, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree—this outline covers the matter fairly well. I believe that the information about each generation of processor should be placed in respective articles, instead of being placed in the main article. These individual processor articles are very sparse as it stands.The Squonk 06:25, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Good outline, something needs done. I think the main AMD article should deal with the company, and only a brief overview of the products. A list of AMD processors should be a separate article, as should a list of its future products, chipsets, grahpics, services, etc. They all should be seperate articles that only on briefly touched upon in the main article. <a href="../../../n/j/a/User%7ENja247_5969.html" title="User:Nja247">Nicholas</a> 16:56, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
