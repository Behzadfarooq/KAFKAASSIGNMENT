== Headline text == The Radio Show The Beginning</p>
<p>Airing on Saturday September 11, 1999, he met the radio market with a storm of new hope for a market already saturated in the day-to-day "get rich quick" financial situation. Richard teaches and looks on the long and storm term effects of how the markets will impact your financial future.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p><br />
== Headline text == Tuesday Night Lights</p>
<p>The 7pm home for the Advisor Answer has been the staple on Tuesday nights for many years. With that time slot move from saturday came much needed rest and a new market, the listeners that were just getting off work. The whole new crew of listeners brought a whole new base of clients. From then on we led the groups of listeners that other financial advisors left out in the cold or had no idea on how to need their needs.</p>
<p><br />
== Headline text == Back To Saturday Mornings</p>
<p>Currently the show is back to the chicken hour of 7:00am. Richard has established himself as a figurehead in the Chattanooga area as far as finance goes. So he has turned his show into an arena where other professionals come in and share their experiences with the public.</p>
