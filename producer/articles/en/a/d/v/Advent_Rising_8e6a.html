<p>Built on <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epic_Games_285b.html" title="Epic Games">Epic Games</a>' <a href="../../../u/n/r/Unreal_engine.html" title="Unreal engine">Unreal engine</a>, the game offers up the legend that a powerful, ancient race will one day unite the universe. Millions of cultures from vastly distant worlds revere and hallow these mythological beings known as <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humans.html" title="Humans">humans</a>. One race, the Seekers, know humans actually exist and feel threatened by their potential power. Under the guise of benevolent explorers, the Seekers travel throughout the galaxy in a desperate attempt to eradicate any human society they unearth. Players assume the role of Gideon Wyeth, a remnant of the last human outpost who is swept up in an ever-evolving series of sequences and events, and on the brink of discovering the incredible powers that lay dormant within him. Another race, the Aurelians, worship humans as gods and, in a way, try to warn them of the Seekers.</p>

<p>Gideon Wyeth arrives at Edumea, a small outpost planet where a gigantic <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extraterrestrial_life_in_popular_culture.html" title="Extraterrestrial life in popular culture">extraterrestrial</a> spaceship has arrived. After meeting up with his brother Ethan and doing a bit of training, Gideon heads to the alien sip with a few human diplomats to meet with the aliens. Upon meeting with the aliens, the group is told of the Seekers, an alien species bent on destroying humanity, which will soon arrive at Edumea and destroy it. At that moment, the Seekers arrive in the system, and Gideon is forced to return to the outpost. After fighting with the boarding Seeker armada and rescuing his girlfriend, Olivia, Gideon is faced with choosing between helping Ethan or Olivia aboard an escape pod. Whichever person he decides not to help is unable to make it to an escape pod themselves, and is lost to the Seeker forces. Minor portions of the story from this point further change slightly depending on who was saved, though the overall plot is the same regardless.</p>
<p>When the escape pod crash lands on Edumea, Gideon gets medical attention for Ethan/Olivia. As he does so, Gideon learns of an imminent global disaster caused by the Seeker threat, and sets out with Ethan/Olivia to find a way off the planet. As meteorites begin raining down upon the planet, Gideon meets Marin Steel, who agrees to help Gideon and Ethan/Olivia off the planet. As they escape the atmosphere, a series of asteroids impact the planet, destroying Edumea. In an effort to search for fellow survivors, Gideon scans the radio waves for distress signals, though only finds an offering of assistance to any humans from the Aurelians, the friendly alien race he had met earlier. After meeting with the Aurelian leaders, Gideon learns that humans have divine properties, and asks to be taught how to use them.</p>
<p>After grasping the basics of his mystical powers, the Aurelian is attacked by the Seekers. Although Gideon and the Aurelians try to fend off the invading forces, their ship is destroyed and they are stuck on the Seeker ship, bent on a crash course with the Aurelian homeworld. After colliding with the Aurelian sea, the ship is evacuated as it sinks, and Ethan/Olivia drowns with it. Retreating to the Aurelian capital with Marin, Gideon and the surviving Aurelian leaders ask the government for assistance, though their effort is interrupted by the arrival of a Seeker ambassador who denies destroying Edumea. Enraged, Gideon attempts to kill him, though he is able to escape.</p>
<p>Determined to remove the Seekers from the planet, Gideon sets out with the Aurelian government's forces in an effort to destroy the Seeker control tower. After fighting through multiple waves of Seeker guards, Gideon succeeds in destroying the tower. In the aftermath of this success, however, the Aurelian government is overthrown by Seeker loyalists, and Gideon is imprisoned. With the help of his psychic abilities and the Aurelians loyal to his cause, Gideon is able to escape and reinstate a favorable government. In a final effort to remove the Seekers from the planet, Gideon sets out with the last of the Aurelian army to destroy the Seeker base. Leading the ground assault, Gideon reaches some holding cells where Marin is being held captive. After freeing her and destroying the Seeker's last lines of defense, the base self-destructs and the Seeker threat is eliminated.</p>
<p>To try an receive more support in fighting the Seekers, Gideon and Marin go to the galactic council to ask for assistance in punishing the Seekers for their genocide of humans. Being an actual humans, the council believes their testimony and turns to the Seeker representatives for an explanation. While the representatives defend their race's innocence, a godlike creature known as a Koroem enters and claims that it destroyed humanity because humanity tried to replicate its appearance. Koroem claims ti have commanded the Seekers to wipe out humanity, and that it has come to absolve the Seekers of any crimes and reclaim it's rule of the galaxy.</p>
<p>With this, Gideon finds Koroem to be the person he didn't save on the outpost, and Marin joins him in trying to defeat the being. When Koroem is defeated, Gideon is drawn into a portal that it creates, leaving Marin to mourn the loss of her last link to humanity. Gideon is transported to an ice world along with some debris from the council chamber. Slowly dying from the cold, all Gideon can do is simply stagger forward seeking some sort of shelter. Moments from death, a mysterious horned creature appears, saying to Gideon, "Come with me human, there is much to be done" ending the game.</p>

<p>Following its Xbox release, Advent Rising received fairly mediocre reviews, receiving a 68 on Game Rankings and a 67 on Metacritic. While some reviewers complemented the game for what it tried to accomplish, most reviewers found the game to have too many faults. Most commonly, reviewers criticized the game's framerate, which tends to slow the game down with only a few enemies on screen and at times even during cutscenes. The targeting system also frequently found ire from reviewers, as it would not be uncommon for the targeting reticule to lock onto objects with no input from the player. The number of assorted glitches present throughout the game that ranged from causing freezing to merely detracting from the gameplay also commonly owed to the game's poor ratings.</p>
<p>Advent Rising's story also received criticism from reviewers, as many felt that the 4-6 hour game had more jumping from one place to another than necessary and far too many two dimensional characters. The game's plot was faulted by many as well, with the story seeming to progress sporadically without properly explaining what is going on. Still, most reviewers felt that the story had a definite epic quality that at the very least is on par with other popular games of the time.</p>
<p>Advent Rising's design choice was noted by some, pointing out that the characters all appear fairly elongated. While many recognized this as a deliberate stylistic element, lending an overall comic book feel to the Advent universe, the game occasionally received criticism for its unique look.</p>
<p>Upon the release of the PC version of the game a month after the Xbox counterpart, Advent Rising ws slightly better received, earning a 72 on Game Rankings and a 70 on Metacritic. Many reviewers felt that the month long delay had been put to good use as many of the glitches in the Xbox version had been fixed. Framerate was also improved dramatically, with slow down becoming a rare occurrence.</p>

<p>An avid comics fan, game creator Donald Mustard originally realized the story of Advent Rising in hand-drawn comic books. "With <i>Advent</i>, from day one, we conceived it initially as a comic book itself. Back when I was getting out of high school, we were laying the foundation for <i>Advent</i>. I drew the first several hours of what would ultimately become the game as a comic book," Mustard revealed in a <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> interview. <a href="http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=5663" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=5663" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
