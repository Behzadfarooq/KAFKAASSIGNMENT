<p>The edits made by mercer are not constructive and may constitute vandalism. I have put a notice on the user's talk page to inform and encourge the user to stop that behavior. <a href="../../../d/p/e/User%7EDPeterson_3157.html" title="User:DPeterson">DPeterson</a> 14:06, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Very true, DPeterson, it was naughty of me and I apologize for having a non-constructive response to your non-constructive contribution.. However, I have now deleted that whole section because of its complete irrelevance, which I was trying to point up by adding the names of other groups who also don't "recognize" ACT. The only circumstance where professional organizations "recognize" an advocacy group is when the group works to fund research or educational efforts-- e.g., the March of Dimes or NAMI. Your para suggested that there is some list of approved advocacy groups that serve as mouthpieces for professional organizations and that it is important to note that a group is not on that list, and this suggestion was deceptive, as you are well aware. These Wiki interchanges are certainly an education in the use of logical fallacies.12.75.168.84 14:17, 22 July 2006 (UTC)Jean Mercer</p>
<p>Of course, many professional groups use the work of advocacy groups in their position papers, but avoid the use of material from fringe groups, for obvious reasons. <a href="../../../a/w/e/User%7EAWeidman_ac2c.html" title="User:AWeidman"><font color="DarkOrange">Dr. Arthur Becker-Weidman</font></a><sub><a href="../../../a/w/e/User_talk%7EAWeidman_1aa7.html" title="User talk:AWeidman">talk</a></sub> 01:55, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have added a reference (link actually) to the website that indictes the author's intentions. Does this meet standards, HumbleGod? The link is: <a href="http://www.childrenintherapy.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.childrenintherapy.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.childrenintherapy.org/</a> which states: "Attachment Therapy on Trial: The Torture and Death of Candace Newmaker An exposé by ACT authors, published by Praeger! Another link states, " It sounds the alarm about the growth of pseudoscience and unvalidated practices in psychotherapy. And it is a call for action to protect the thousands of children who are not only among the most vulnerable, but also among the most likely, to receive abusive and harmful treatment at the hands of trusted adults … their caretakers — and their therapists!" and offers links to purchase the book.

<li>The problem with the statement as it stands is that "agenda" (as it's used here) strikes me as a <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weasel_word.html" title="Weasel word">weasel word</a> to imply that there's a motive beyond the informational aspects of publishing this book. It might be better to state it exactly as you do above--"The book professes to sound the alarm about the growth of...." The subtitle ""An exposé by ACT authors, published by Praeger" doesn't really hint directly at an agenda, as far as I can see it. I'll not revert further (except to reinstate some style formats that your reversion removed), but I expect other editors might find the current wording problematic as well. -- <b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">H·G</a></b> (<sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumbleGod_dc3d.html" title="User talk:HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">words</font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HumbleGod_9674.html" title="Special:Contributions/HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">works</font></a></sub>) 05:20, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Based on your comments I've changed "agenda" to "in support of their mission." Since the book is written by the three leaders of ACT and sold on their website, I think that is a fair and NPOV statement.

<p>While the group seems to try to influence legislation and advocate with various professional groups, I could find no mention of the group in any APSAC, APA, NASW, or AMA practice protocols or recommendations. Nor did I find any reference to them in the Special Issue of Attachment and Human Development that was devoted to issues in the diagnosis and treatment of Reactive Attachment Disorder and related topics.

<dd>Proving a negative is devilishly difficult. That is why the burden of proof is on the one making the claim. State a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> verifying the claim that there is <i>no</i> mention whatever of ACT in any protocol or recommendation of any of the organizations mentioned. Moreover, cite a source verifying the claim that "mention" of a group in a protocol or recommendation constitutes recognition or acceptance by these organizations. Cite a source even to verify the claim that any of the groups mentioned "recognize" or "accept" advocacy groups as a matter of policy. Most especially, cite a reliable source that "recognition" by these groups is a requirement to be a part of the "mainstream" of the "mental health professional community" (or even what that community is). Most especially, cite a reliable source for the claim that ACT's "advice is not sought by these groups, nor intended to be so" by the organizations mentioned.</dd>

<dd>Without verifiability of the statements made, the entire section must go, and I am prepared to delete it. It can be reinstated when verification is found.</dd>

<p>In the process of several interested parties adding various facts and perspective on this article's subject, the article itself has become quite unwiedly. As a relatively uninterested editor with absolutely no position or agenda relating to this group or its focus, I've made a number of edits, which I summarize below:</p>
<ol>
<li><i>Reorganized.</i> Typically Wikipedia articles on organizations have an introductory paragraph; a section which describes the group's focus and activities in more detail; a section on criticisms, caveats, and other possible disclaimers regarding the group, and a section on additional links/articles. I've reorganized the existing paragraphs to better reflect this standard.</li>
<li><i>Removed over-emphasized points.</i> When I returned to this article this evening, the lack of stated acceptance of this organization and its practices by professional health and mental-health organizations was mentioned no fewer than three times. This was overkill, and I've paired it down to the <b>Acceptance by...</b> section. The fact that these organizations aren't directly advocating the positions of this organization certainly merits a section, but it doesn't need to be repeated after every mention of the organization's practices.</li>
<li><i>Moved sentences around.</i> Different points were being made all over the place here. I've tried to group all of the sentences together in a related fashion to form more coherent paragraphs. I think I've largely succeeded, although I didn't focus much effort on the <b>Acceptance by...</b> section, which still looks like a horrid tug-of-war gone wrong between various editors' perspectives.</li>

<p>This entire section seems irrelevant. Groups like the AMA and APA have no reason to support or condemn a group that doesn't advertise any diagnosis, theory, or treatment. To me, this looks like a misdirected backlash against criticism of attachment therapy. Because AT actually does involve diagnosing and treating people, it is justifiably subject to medical criticism. It matters what medical experts think about a medical theory like AT. ACT, on the other hand, doesn't treat any patients, doesn't diagnose anybody, and doesn't claim to be able to cure anything. Therefore they don't need the approval of medical associations. <a href="../../../3/2/2E/User%7E32.97.110.142.html" title="User:32.97.110.142">32.97.110.142</a> 16:49, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As an advocacy group ACT has stated that they intend to influence various groups and they have made such efforts. Therefore, to the extent that their efforts are ignored by the groups they seek to influence (such as AMA, NASW, APA, etc), the section is an accurate and NPOV statement. ACT does not need the approval of any group, but it does seek to influence them and thereby achieve legitimacy for its positions; which it has not, in the instances cited. <a href="../../../d/p/e/User%7EDPeterson_3157.html" title="User:DPeterson"><font color="red">DPeterson</font></a><sup><a href="../../../d/p/e/User_talk%7EDPeterson_eca1.html" title="User talk:DPeterson">talk</a></sup> 17:12, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In addition, much of ACT's material on their website and the materials produced by Sarner, Rosa, and Mercer describe and advocate regarding "Attachment Therapy."

<p>The section has sources. The groups do not need to reject ACT. What they do is not consider any of ACT's attempts to influence their actions, which as an advocacy group ACT states is it's purpose! Those groups do take the advice of many other groups. Your request for a source that they rejct ACT is not valid as that is not what the statement says in the section. Please do not continue to merely revert.

<p>You are mistating the point. The groups in question do not cite ACT but do cite other groups in their work. The professional groups in question do not have to say they refuse to recognize ACT as that is not the point, the point is that they just don't recognize ACT or use it's materials. What is being stated is that the professional groups in question do not mention ACT in any of their material in support of the professional group's positions. This is despite the fact that ACT seeks to influence such groups and has clearly not been successful in it's efforts. The citations provided support this. Also see the points of other editors made previous to yours, which relate and support keeping the material in as written.

<p>Since Stephen B. owne Quackwatch and has ACT material on his website, a link to the Wikipedia article about him is relevant, I believe. <a href="../../../d/p/e/User%7EDPeterson_3157.html" title="User:DPeterson"><font color="red">DPeterson</font></a><sup><a href="../../../d/p/e/User_talk%7EDPeterson_eca1.html" title="User talk:DPeterson">talk</a></sup> 03:37, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So... how does that make him related? Do we put Ted Turner in the See also links of every TV station that runs CNN feeds, because he owns the company that puts material on their Web sites? If you can show that any link exists between the person and ACT, other than occasionally having links to material, you can insert it. If he was on the board of ACT, that'd be a different story.

As such ACT is not part of the mainstream mental health professional community and its advice is not sought by these groups, although ACT does attempt to influence such groups; "ACT works to mobilize parents, professionals, private and governmental regulators, prosecutors, juries, and legislators" [1] Is accurate and valid. None of the professional groups cited mention ACT, although they do use materials from other groups.

<p>'<b>Support'</b> I agree with the previous comment. The prior version of this page should be put up. As the article now stands, nearly all of it has been gutted. The Also see section was quite useful and relevant. This allows readers to have a convenient section to find links to related articles, which is consistent with Wikipedia Man. of Style. In addition, the section on mental health was relevant and informative. It demonstrated the actual standing of this group in the general mental health community. A casual reader should have this information and it is of encyclopedia standards as well as consistent with Wikipedia Man. of Style and related documents and advisements. <a href="../../../d/p/e/User%7EDPeterson_3157.html" title="User:DPeterson"><font color="red">DPeterson</font></a><sup><a href="../../../d/p/e/User_talk%7EDPeterson_eca1.html" title="User talk:DPeterson">talk</a></sup> 23:34, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>'<b>Support'</b>As several editors have noted, The See also links are qite relevant and as noted, many other pages have links to articles in the See also section that are cited in the article.

This is consistent with Wikipedia policy and practice in that it makes articles and related links available and easily assessible to others without having to hunt through an article to find a link. The statement that varius professional groups do not use ACT material but use material from other groups and that ACT seeks to influence such groups is clearly sourced on the various webpages cited.

But it is bullying to say you have the "right" to "override" a consensus. Obviously a number of people differ in their views, and that is fine.

<dd>It's not bullying to state a fact. Until you can cite a source which says "ACT is not part of the mainstream mental health professional community" you may not say it on Wikipedia. That's simply policy. The paragraph in question clearly is an attempt to denigrate ACT by implying that it's a bunch of fringe nutcases. It may be that - I don't know. But until you have a source which says that (and you have yet to find one), you may not say it in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> are quite clear that we may not paint a picture which nobody else has painted.

Those large, well-respected professional organizations do seek input from various groups, but not from Advoctes for Children in Therapy. As such ACT is not part of the mainstream mental health professional community and its advice is not sought by these groups, although ACT does attempt to influence such groups; "ACT works to mobilize parents, professionals, private and governmental regulators, prosecutors, juries, and legislators" [1] Is accurate and valid. None of the professional groups cited mention ACT, although they do use materials from other groups. I find no mention of ACT on the NASW website, although they do use materials of other groups.

<dd>I used my admin tools in an attempt to implement consensus on this Talk page - I dropped my objection to the See also section and thus there was no reason why it should not have been added, given that all parties agreed to it being there. My placement of it was intended as a show of good faith. However, if you saw it as admin abuse, then clearly I made the wrong decision, and hence immediately reverted myself. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 04:06, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Per <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, <b>Original research is a term used in Wikipedia to refer to material placed in articles by Wikipedia users that has not been previously published by a reliable source. It includes unpublished material, for example, arguments, concepts, data, ideas, statements, or theories, or any new analysis or synthesis of published material that appears to advance a position — or, in the words of Wikipedia's co-founder Jimbo Wales, that would amount to a "novel narrative or historical interpretation."</b> Wikipedia prohibits original research. There have never been sourced citations for the assertions that "ACT is not part of the mainstream mental health professional community." This statement appears to be based on the assertion that ACT is not a member of the preceding groups, which are called "well-respected" - clearly inferring that, by omission, ACT is not well-respected. Again, unsourced original research and synthesis. Until published sources are presented which advance the arguments made in that paragraph, the paragraph will not be allowed to exist on Wikipedia.

<dd>No, it's not, and I've said why it's not repeatedly. You have no source to claim that it is not part of the mainstream mental health community. There is nothing to say why it should matter that those various organizations "recognize or accept" ACT. There is nothing to say why it should matter that "well-respected" organizations don't mention ACT on their Web sites. The paragraph is clearly attempting to create negative connotations about the organization without proper sourcing. Is there a statement from the APA which states they do not accept ACT? Is there a position paper from the AMA which says they reject ACT's theories? Until you face these facts, there's nothing more to argue about, and the article will continue to not have these statements.

<dd>Well it matters whether the groups an advocacy group seeks to influence take that advocacy group's views into consideration in its work...and in this case ample evidence has been presented to show that those groups do not use ACT's material despite ACT's efforts ipso facto they are not recognized.

<p>From our Verifiability policy: "The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth." It may very well be true that ACT is a fringe loony bin. It may very well be true that everyone ignores them. Conversely, it may very well be true that they are right about everything they say and that you are all wrong. I don't know, and I can't know - and frankly, I don't care.</p>
<p>What I do know is that we do not have any <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> which state any opinions about the organization. Thus, we <b>cannot</b>, repeat, <b>cannot</b> state any opinions about the organization. We cannot make any insinuations about what the organization does or who might or might not listen to it. We can report only the verifiable facts that the organization exists, that they make XYZ claims and that XYZ organizations don't take any position on what they say. That's what Wikipedia is - an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 20:38, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>What I don't understand at all is the issue at stake here. Do they oppose a treatment that is generally considered safe and effective? Then let's talk about that specific issue, and mention who defends that treatment as safe and effective. Is there a controversial treatment where we can cite ACT opponents who say the specific thing at issue is safe, and why, and thus juxtapose their positions on the issue?

<p>Why does the article go out of its way to point out that major organizations take input from other advocacy groups?

<dl>
<dd>The article does not go out of its way to point this out. Since ACT states in it's mission that it's purpose is to impact major organizations and it has not been able to do so, this is salient...Other wording, "This group's input has not been recognized or accepted by APA, AMA...." was not accepted by other editors. <a href="../../../d/p/e/User%7EDPeterson_3157.html" title="User:DPeterson"><font color="red">DPeterson</font></a><sup><a href="../../../d/p/e/User_talk%7EDPeterson_eca1.html" title="User talk:DPeterson">talk</a></sup> 00:47, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The article gives six citations about how these major organizations take input from other advocacy groups and gives no citation or reference about how they do <i>not</i> have an official position on ATC. I understand that such a reference would be nearly impossible to find. However, these major organizations don't have position statements on many other advocacy groups and I don't see how it is notable in itself. Is the intent is to explain that this organization isn't effective? I am unsure if wikipedia is the place to decide whether or not an organization is effective in achieving its stated goals. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShotwell_e27f.html" title="User:Shotwell">shotwell</a> 02:27, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you read the history of the article you will see that those citations were required by Administrator FCYTravis. The statement that those groups do not use material from ACT and have not responded to ACT's advocacy were removed because of the Administrator's comments and statements regarding Wikipedia policy. Since ACT's purpose is to lobby those groups and those groups do have material related to ACT's area of advocacy, but do not use ACT's material, only material of others, hence the statement as it is. <a href="../../../d/p/e/User%7EDPeterson_3157.html" title="User:DPeterson"><font color="red">DPeterson</font></a><sup><a href="../../../d/p/e/User_talk%7EDPeterson_eca1.html" title="User talk:DPeterson">talk</a></sup> 12:51, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, the citations are needed if the statement there. I get the feeling that the article is trying to convey that this is a fringe group with limited influence. Once again, a very superficial reading of their website makes this clear, as does their list of activities in the article. Obviously we cannot come out and say "this group is ineffective", but I can understand the desire to try and convey this message. However, <i>wikipedia is not the place to build arguments that have not already been built</i>. Moreover, none of us can say if these major organizations have taken input from this group and such a statement is nearly impossible to cite (unless you could find some reference from the group itself). If the ultimate purpose of this wording is to convey that ACT is ineffective, then I do not believe it belongs in the article. I say that the best option would be to list their mission statement, their activities, and further note that they do not keep membership statistics. This, along with their website, will speak for itself. In its present state, this article is using the facts to make subtle suggestions to the reader. Finally, a good portion of those citations are simply the organizations' websites. I don't think that this constitutes a citation, but I'm not an expert on wikipedia citation rules. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShotwell_e27f.html" title="User:Shotwell">shotwell</a> 14:19, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually we can say whether or not AMA, APA, NASW, etc have taken input for this group...they have not. These groups state when they use material/advocacy from other groups and there is no mention of ACT. The statement as it reads is a verifiable statement of fact.

<dd>If you follow the last few references each of those lead to a citing of an advocacy group, such as the NEA at the APA site. No I don't read it the way you do. It depends on what you mean by "fringe group." If you mean a group with few members that is not recognized by any large well respected or "main stream" group (such as AMA, NEA, Democratic or Republican Party, etc) then this might qualify as such. But the facts stated are sourced appropriately and adequately. <a href="../../../d/p/e/User%7EDPeterson_3157.html" title="User:DPeterson"><font color="red">DPeterson</font></a><sup><a href="../../../d/p/e/User_talk%7EDPeterson_eca1.html" title="User talk:DPeterson">talk</a></sup> 21:10, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>I've read this exchange with interest. This is very informative and helpful. I appreciate the thought that has gone into it. I follow the links (especially the last in the set) and they clearly show that those well-respected professional organizations and membership groups do take material from various advocacy groups...no mention of ACT.

<dd>Most of the links are just to the organizations' websites. I don't think that qualifies as a source, but I'm not familiar with the citation guidelines. Moreover, a lack of references about ACT does not constitute proof for whether or not the major organizations have taken input from them. As it stands now, the claim is not referenced by the sources. The argument being built appears to be unique to wikipedia and this is a clear violation of widely accepted wikipedia guidelines. Finally, because this argument discredits ACT, I <b>strongly</b> insist on a <i>clear</i>, <i>credible</i>, and <i>strong</i> citation. Can anyone provide me with such a source? If such a source cannot be provided, then that statement needs to removed immediately. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShotwell_e27f.html" title="User:Shotwell">shotwell</a> 00:51, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If you look at all the links you will see several that provide data you want. For example, one of the links is to the APA site and shows that group using material from NEA. There is no evidence that any of the groups cited have taken advice and input form ACT, despite that being ACT's stated mission. Nor are there any references to such use of ACT material on ACT's website, where you'd expect to see it. The links show that those major well respected professional groups do accept input from various advocacy groups; just not ACT.<a href="../../../a/w/e/User%7EAWeidman_ac2c.html" title="User:AWeidman"><b><font color="#FF9933" face="monotype"><big>Dr. Becker-Weidman</big></font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/w/e/User_talk%7EAWeidman_1aa7.html" title="User talk:AWeidman"><font color="#00FF00">Talk</font></a></sup> 22:20, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are an academic, right? Would you ever include a source like that in an academic paper? That is, would your source to a claim in an academic paper ever be, "Go poke around at these sites and you'll see that it is true."? Of course not. The provided citations are no good when it comes to backing up the claim made in this article. Moreover, the claim made in this article appears to be made exclusively limited to this article. The only way that this article can claim this group doesn't consult with the APA is if a credible source has already made such a statement. Finally, I'll restate that this particular claim serves to discredit ACT. As such, someone needs to find a credible source that makes this claim, otherwise it <b>cannot</b> stay in the article. I am pretty sure that <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> are all backing me up here. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShotwell_e27f.html" title="User:Shotwell">shotwell</a> 23:30, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Most of the links are just to the organization's website. How does a link to an organization's website count as a secondary source? Moreover, none of the sources support the claim "the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association and the National Association of Social Workers have not taken positions on ACT's work". Now, it may very well be true that none of us are able to find a reference to ACT on those websites, but that doesn't prove anything except that we cannot find a position statement. Whether or not something is true, it <b>must</b> have a reliable source if we want to claim it in a wikipedia article. Now, can someone please tell me <i>why</i> I'm wrong without just telling me I'm wrong? <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShotwell_e27f.html" title="User:Shotwell">shotwell</a> 21:34, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>the sources seem quite adequate to me. They verifiy that those groups do not use ACT material (none in present and they do not mention ACT) but they do use material from other advocacy groups and acknowledge that. ACT seeks to influence those groups and has not done so.

<dd>I have seen the sources and I don't feel that they meet the guidelines. What I'd really like is for someone to give me a satisfying argument about why I'm wrong or come up with what I consider to be a good source.

<p>The links clearly show that those groups take advocacy comments and ideas from other advocacy groups and nowhere is ACT mentioned. Therefore, these are good sources...the actual webpages of the professional groups in question listing their reliance on other group's information. Again, no where on their sites is ACT mentioned.

<dd>I know I said I was done, but I am compelled to say this: While your opinion is valuable to me, simply telling me what I've already been told countless times ("the links clearly show...") won't have an effect on me. I will list out my objections here so that they are easy to refute:
<ul>
<li>We can't cite claims by pointing the reader at some websites where the reader must then click around the website to <i>infer</i> that the claim is true. These are not secondary, reliable, and verifiable sources per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>.</li>
<li>The only place that this claim exists is on wikipedia. Right at the top of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> it says that articles "must refer only to facts, assertions, theories, ideas, claims, opinions, and arguments that have already been published by reputable publishers". <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> further states that something is considered orginial research if " it introduces an argument, without citing a reputable source for that argument".</li>
<li>The statement is irrelevant and only serves to discredit ACT; as such it needs especially good sources.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Finally, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> states that "Editors adding new material to an article should cite a reputable source, or it may be challenged or removed by any editor." The burden of proof lies on those wishing to insert a claim into an article; not on the person who wants to remove or challenge it. I'm going to go ahead and remove the statement seeing as how my concerns have not been clearly addressed. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShotwell_e27f.html" title="User:Shotwell">shotwell</a> 18:11, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with the views shotwell has expressed. I just wanted to add that there is no indication that ACT has tried to influence any of the listed organizations. From what I can gather, ACT seems to focus on legislation and court cases rather than on these groups. I don't think it makes sense to state that these groups do not use ACT's information without evidence that ACT has lobbied them in any way. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStokerAce_bfc5.html" title="User:StokerAce">StokerAce</a> 18:48, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>'<b>I agree'</b> with the view of MarkWood and others...all of whom have substantial experience as editors of Wikipedia and of this subject and the various related subjects. They are knowledgeable and represent, as I read their views, a NPOV, wanting to state facts with relevant sources and citations. ACT makes clear that as an advocacy group they seek to influence professional orgs...for example, see the letter on their site by Mercer to ATTACh. Therefore, it makes sense to include the facts that large professional organizations do not use ACT materials. ACT states that their mission is to impact such groups...but show no evidence of success. <a href="../../../a/w/e/User%7EAWeidman_ac2c.html" title="User:AWeidman"><b><font color="#FF9933" face="monotype"><big>Dr. Becker-Weidman</big></font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/w/e/User_talk%7EAWeidman_1aa7.html" title="User talk:AWeidman"><font color="#00FF00">Talk</font></a></sup> 19:55, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, the APSAC/APA report about Attachment Therapy mentions ACT and references an essay by ACT; so you are patently wrong about whether or not their information is used.

Finally, I would like to point out that ACT is a vocal critic of your research, therapeutic methods, and an organization to which you are strongly affiliated.

<p>Why does the "Opposition to Attachment Therapy" section talk about the definition of attachment therapy? There is already an article about it in wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShotwell_e27f.html" title="User:Shotwell">shotwell</a> 02:27, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Because this is the primary (in fact exclusive) focus of this group; "Attachment Therapy/"<a href="../../../d/p/e/User%7EDPeterson_3157.html" title="User:DPeterson"><font color="red">DPeterson</font></a><sup><a href="../../../d/p/e/User_talk%7EDPeterson_eca1.html" title="User talk:DPeterson">talk</a></sup> 00:47, 2 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, but seeing as how there is already an article about Attachment Therapy, it seems appropriate to simply include a link. Any discussions about whether or not the term is well-defined belong (and deserve to be) in that article. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShotwell_e27f.html" title="User:Shotwell">shotwell</a> 02:27, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Since I know nothing about any of this, I am qualified to say that it didn't help me in the slightest. To put it in a different context, imagine an article about some barely known baseball team that talks about the rules of baseball. Clearly that would be redundant because there is already an article about baseball. Moreover, the claims about baseball would have less visibility and hence, they wouldn't recieve the same amount of scrutiny. Finally, this article is making a slightly controversial claim about the definition of Attachment Therapy. Clearly <i>someone</i> thinks it is well-defined because they have an entire organization about it. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShotwell_e27f.html" title="User:Shotwell">shotwell</a> 14:19, 2 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Again, it is verifiable that the def. is controversial and there is no agreed upon def as there are for other terms in psychology and forms of psychotherapy. Giving a summary and then the lead into the main article is fairly stanndard in Wikipedia and, again, here represents a compromise and consensus. <a href="../../../d/p/e/User%7EDPeterson_3157.html" title="User:DPeterson"><font color="red">DPeterson</font></a><sup><a href="../../../d/p/e/User_talk%7EDPeterson_eca1.html" title="User talk:DPeterson">talk</a></sup> 18:15, 2 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I can see that the definition is controversial and this is partially why I don't think a disussion of the definition belongs here. I would agree that it is typical for a wikipedia article to give a summary about the subject of the article and then lead into the article. In this case, the article is giving a summary about the subject of a different article. Seeing as how this article is about ACT, I think it should stick to that particular topic as much as possible. Can you please address these particular issues? <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShotwell_e27f.html" title="User:Shotwell">shotwell</a> 18:52, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Since the group uses this term and since the group is really a one issue group (it's mission is to oppose "Attachment Therapy"), a definition and brief description of the issue belongs here with the details to be found on the related article. <a href="../../../d/p/e/User%7EDPeterson_3157.html" title="User:DPeterson"><font color="red">DPeterson</font></a><sup><a href="../../../d/p/e/User_talk%7EDPeterson_eca1.html" title="User talk:DPeterson">talk</a></sup> 21:10, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why is it noteworthy that Attachment Therapy is <i>not</i> defined in the two mentioned books? Presenting information in this way does not seem NPOV to me. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShotwell_e27f.html" title="User:Shotwell">shotwell</a> 02:27, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Because there is no agreed upon def. of "Attachment Therapy." These two books are very well known and respected and would be instantly identified by anyone in the mental health field. <a href="../../../d/p/e/User%7EDPeterson_3157.html" title="User:DPeterson"><font color="red">DPeterson</font></a><sup><a href="../../../d/p/e/User_talk%7EDPeterson_eca1.html" title="User talk:DPeterson">talk</a></sup> 00:47, 2 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Ok, I was unaware of the importance of these books. Note that wikipedia articles should not be written <i>to</i> experts. I really believe that this information belongs in the Attachment Therapy article. However, should it be placed there, it would be good to try and explain the importance of that information in such a way that can be understood by mere laymen such as myself. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShotwell_e27f.html" title="User:Shotwell">shotwell</a> 02:27, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The book references belong here to support the statement (citation). Citations and references for statements are important. Again, FCYTravis required lots and lots of citations and bases for statements. <a href="../../../d/p/e/User%7EDPeterson_3157.html" title="User:DPeterson"><font color="red">DPeterson</font></a><sup><a href="../../../d/p/e/User_talk%7EDPeterson_eca1.html" title="User talk:DPeterson">talk</a></sup> 12:51, 2 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, the citations are important. Once again, this issue would be totally avoided if the relevant information was in the AT article. Furthermore, it appears as if the article is making another argument for whether or not AT is well-defined. Wikipedia articles shouldn't generally do this. It would be better if you could find some expert opinion that said exactly what the article is leading the reader to believe. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShotwell_e27f.html" title="User:Shotwell">shotwell</a> 14:19, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, these two texts are the "bibles" or sites for generally recognized definitions. Furthermore, the term, "Attachment Therapy" is not found eleswhere and when cited in lit is mentioned as an ill-defined term. <a href="../../../d/p/e/User%7EDPeterson_3157.html" title="User:DPeterson"><font color="red">DPeterson</font></a><sup><a href="../../../d/p/e/User_talk%7EDPeterson_eca1.html" title="User talk:DPeterson">talk</a></sup> 21:10, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have found many references to "Attachment Therapy" in the literature and none of them mention that it is ill-defined. Moreover, I found yet another organization interested in this topic: <a href="http://www.attach.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.attach.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.attach.org/</a>. Because of this, and my other issue about the word 'defines', I feel it is approrpriate to mark this article as having disputed neutrality until we can flesh out these details. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShotwell_e27f.html" title="User:Shotwell">shotwell</a> 22:32, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can you cite your sources for the statement, "I have found many references to "Attachment Therapy" in the literature...." As a professional in the field, I can say it is an ill-defined term with no commonly agreed upon meaning in the same way that there is a commonly agreed upon meaning in the field for such terms as Cognitive Behvioral Therapy or EMDR, or Psychoanalysis, etc. I think that since you have a different point of view, it may be appropriate for you to mark this article as in dispute...but I am not really all that familiar with Wikipedia policy on such markings. If I get a moment (HA!) I may look it up...but for now, I think your marking it as you have is probably a good idea, especially if it will help people work things out on this page and not in the article. <a href="../../../a/w/e/User%7EAWeidman_ac2c.html" title="User:AWeidman"><b><font color="#FF9933" face="monotype"><big>Dr. Becker-Weidman</big></font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/w/e/User_talk%7EAWeidman_1aa7.html" title="User talk:AWeidman"><font color="#00FF00">Talk</font></a></sup> 23:27, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A simple search on pubmed, medline, et al. all pull up references. I performed another search today at my university and pulled up several more. A quick google search (web and scholar) brought up even more. Here is one: <i>Does Attachment Therapy Work? Results of Two Preliminary Studies</i>, Second Edition. Published by Association for Teaching and Training in the Attachment of Children available from The Attachment Center Press. Here is another: <i>Report of the APSAC Task Force on Attachment Therapy, Reactive Attachment Disorder, and Attachment Problems</i>. Child Maltreatment, 11 (1), 2006, pp 76-89. I can provide many more examples upon request. The phrase "Attachment Therapy" in these sources would suggest that experts in the field can say "Attachment Therapy" and be <i>generally understood</i>. It may seem odd why I'm pressing this so hard. My concern stems from the fact that one way to discredit an organization is to make it seem as if they are fighting against something which doesn't even exist. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShotwell_e27f.html" title="User:Shotwell">shotwell</a> 00:31, 4 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As both documents show, there is no generally agreed upon meaning to the term "Attachment Therapy." The APSAC report states this pretty clearly and when you compare the definition of this vague term in various souces, you see big differences. ACT does have a clear difinition of "Attachment Therapy," but that is different than APSAC or the other you cite. <a href="../../../a/w/e/User%7EAWeidman_ac2c.html" title="User:AWeidman"><b><font color="#FF9933" face="monotype"><big>Dr. Becker-Weidman</big></font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/w/e/User_talk%7EAWeidman_1aa7.html" title="User talk:AWeidman"><font color="#00FF00">Talk</font></a></sup> 22:30, 4 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But the term is well-defined enough to use in an article title. That suggests to me that it is well-defined enough to just provide a link to the attachment therapy article and let any debate about its definition take place there. Now, I would not object to saying something like "Although the notion Attachment Therapy is considered to be ambiguous by some, ACT uses these seven criteria..." <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShotwell_e27f.html" title="User:Shotwell">shotwell</a> 22:50, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, but the article makes a claim about their stated definition of "Attachment Therapy" and it seems appropriate that such a claim would be sourced by their own writings. The current source provided in the article does not support the claim it is intended to support. Moreover, I found a list of seven criteria that ACT uses to define Attachment Therapy. As it stands now, this wikipedia article is just blatantly wrong about ACT's definition of Attachment Therapy. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShotwell_e27f.html" title="User:Shotwell">shotwell</a> 00:04, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The current revision of the article states: "The ACT defines Attachment Therapy as "the imposition of boundary violations - most often coercive restraint - and verbal abuse on a child, usually for hours at a time...Typically, the child is put in a lap hold with the arms pinned down, or alternatively an adult lies on top of a child lying prone on the floor." That quote is taken from <a href="http://www.childrenintherapy.org/essays/overview.html" class="external text" title="http://www.childrenintherapy.org/essays/overview.html" rel="nofollow">Attachment Therapy: Child Abuse by Another Name</a> and is found under the heading "What Attachment Therapy is Like". Describing Attachment Therapy is clearly not the same as <b>defining</b> attachment therapy. If I said, "Foobar2000 is terrible", I am not defining Foobar2000. They list seven criteria in the very same article, stating "For our purposes, we have identified several distinguishing characteristics, any one of which qualifies a practice to be called Attachment Therapy". It would seem much more informative to include this and I stand by my assertion that the current article revision is blatantly wrong. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShotwell_e27f.html" title="User:Shotwell">shotwell</a> 23:02, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Attachment Therapy (AT) is the imposition of boundary violations — most often coercive restraint — and verbal abuse on a child, usually for hours at a time. Typically, the child is put in a lap hold with the arms pinned down, or alternatively an adult lies on top of a child lying prone on the floor. These are known as “holding” and “compression” therapies, respectively, though many other names have been employed for them over the years. Sometimes a child is immobilized inside a blanket or sheet, which is often called either a “mummy,” “burrito,” or “angel” wrap.</p>

<p>You might infer that they define it that way, but your inference doesn't count here.

<dd>How can anyone possibly say this? They are describing what it would be like to undergo Attachment Therapy, the full quote above makes this obvious . They go on further to state that, yes the definition is ambiguous, but that they use seven criteria to distinguish exactly what it is they're advocating against. The current revision of the article is patently absurd. Moreover, it leads to the reader to believe that ACT is solely opposed to holding therapy, when it would appear that they are opposed to any sort of coercive therapies used specifically to treat "Attachment Disorder". Once again, simply stating "no, you are wrong" does not constitute a rebuttal in any sense of the word and it is not going to resolve this issue in my mind. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShotwell_e27f.html" title="User:Shotwell">shotwell</a> 17:15, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>'<b>I have to agree'</b> that the link shows is to their def of the term. I see it clearly. They define "Attachment Therapy" as the article states. This is fact and is now sourced and cited in accord with Wikipedia standards. What is infered from their own statement is not the issue at all. The issue is that this is their statement...in their own words as is a <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verifiable.html" title="Verifiable">verifiable</a> fact!! Now, if you propose to add a statement that '<b>adds'</b> to this and expands it, that would be great...propose the specific language here for comment and suggestions and consensus....I for one would very much like to see more information added and an expanded article and you'd have my support on such an addition, after I've seen it and had an opportunity to think about it. The rebuttal is that the link and source and citation speaks for itself and is <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verifiable.html" title="Verifiable">verifiable</a>.

<p>No, they are defining "Attachment Therapy." Those are their own words and that is the strongest verified source or citation. The definition should stay.

<p>Why are there "See Also" links to wikipedia articles that were already linked to? Moreover, why is the "quackwatch" article linked here? Are the two organizations related?

In that manner, consensus is reached and articles improve, and editor's knowledgeg and expertise increases. I've learned a lot following various talk page discussions. I've learned a lot from FCYTravi's discussions and interventions on this page, for example. I became an advocate recently because of a very positive experience using an advocate.

<p>I have written what I think would be an ideal compromise for this article: <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShotwell_Proposed_ACT_9138.html" title="User:Shotwell/Proposed ACT">User:Shotwell/Proposed ACT</a>. Aside from my poor prose, what objections are there to this version of the article? <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShotwell_e27f.html" title="User:Shotwell">shotwell</a> 21:45, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I slightly changed the proposed revision. In particular, I added the fact that ACT uses seven criteria to distinguish AT from other forms of therapy. I then changed further references to AT to reflect that ACT is using their own definition. Perhaps this is more neutral?</p>
<p>It seems like the issue with this article (and other Attachment Therapy related articles) may be that some people who specialize in valid treatment techniques for actual disorders feel they are being labelled as quacks because their specialization deals with Attachment. They take issue with the phrase 'Attachment Therapy' because it is too broadly applied and its usage often has the effect of lumping legitimate research with pseudo-scientific research. I find that this is a common thing in the sciences. That is, legitimate researchers get categorized with pseudo-scientific researchers through broad generalizations of whatever theory is at issue. Often, the mere existence of some pseudo-scientific theory can kill all research in a related (legitimate) area due to misconceptions by universities, funding agencies, politicians, and the public. Thus, several editors here are trying to prevent wikipedia from making broad generalizations about what is labelled as Attachment Therapy because such generalizations are potentially dishonest and harmful? Is this what is going on? I have absolutely no knowledge of psychology aside from what I've seen in Woody Allen movies.</p>
<p>Let's assume the above is true. Then yeah, we should edit these articles in such a way that allows readers to separate the cruft from the science. The only way to do this is to simply present verified facts and give each fact whatever importance it deserves. Readers must be allowed to draw their own conclusions. Generally, facts speak for themselves and presenting information in a way that makes subtle arguments can often lead the reader to infer a contradictory conclusion. Readers don't like to be fed subtle arguments. I think that this, and other Attachment Therapy articles would benefit from more attention by experts in these fields. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShotwell_e27f.html" title="User:Shotwell">shotwell</a> 13:36, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

While some editors may not like the sources cited or agree with the links and evidence, it is still valid. Perhaps a better solution would be to either cite the alternative view with facts and citations. Alternatively, it might be better to propose specific edits here for each section and then see if there is concensus for making those edits...or through dialogue and discussion, reach consensus. <a href="../../../a/w/e/User%7EAWeidman_ac2c.html" title="User:AWeidman"><b><font color="#FF9933" face="monotype"><big>Dr. Becker-Weidman</big></font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/w/e/User_talk%7EAWeidman_1aa7.html" title="User talk:AWeidman"><font color="#00FF00">Talk</font></a></sup> 22:39, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is a controversial article...as the edit history shows and the talk page shows, some leaders of ACT and their colleagues had strong objections to material here. I suspect that there are very strong feelings involved and that it is best to proceed slowly and cautiously. Following that tack, I'd suggest beginning with suggestions here for edits and proposed substitutions and allowing plenty of time for dialogue and consensus building. I think in this way we will get a better article. <a href="../../../a/w/e/User%7EAWeidman_ac2c.html" title="User:AWeidman"><b><font color="#FF9933" face="monotype"><big>Dr. Becker-Weidman</big></font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/w/e/User_talk%7EAWeidman_1aa7.html" title="User talk:AWeidman"><font color="#00FF00">Talk</font></a></sup> 22:42, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I consider the revised article to be a vast improvement in comparison to the original. Unlike the original this revised version states the facts and is void of opinion and bias. Anne11 23:21, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You should propose sepecific changes here to sections; section by section. I don't find the proposed revised article acceptable...it leaves out way to much important and verified information. I realize that the ACT group and it's leaders disagee and that is why they advocated for the deletion of this page. I suppose supporters of ACT might accept and want a watered down version...but that would eliminate too many facts. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamDavidson_1ba9.html" title="User:SamDavidson">SamDavidson</a> 19:31, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Firstly, I don't support ACT one way or the other. I'd just like to see a neutral article that contains verifiable statements. This could be a discussion about Pokemon for all I care. We have guidliens like <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> for a reason. It may be perfectly true that they don't work with organizations like the APA, but we cannot take anyone's word on it without a citation stating <i>exactly that</i>. Secondly, what verifiable facts are missing? <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShotwell_e27f.html" title="User:Shotwell">shotwell</a> 20:34, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Exactly, your poistion on ACT is irrelevant. Producing a good article is what everyone should strive for. I find that the article is neutral in tone and has many more citations and sources than comparable articles...perhaps because it is so controversial. The citations clearly show that APA, APA, AMA, NASW don't use ACT information but do use other groups' information. I find the citations and sources relevant, clear and compelling. <a href="../../../a/w/e/User%7EAWeidman_ac2c.html" title="User:AWeidman"><b><font color="#FF9933" face="monotype"><big>Dr. Becker-Weidman</big></font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/w/e/User_talk%7EAWeidman_1aa7.html" title="User talk:AWeidman"><font color="#00FF00">Talk</font></a></sup> 22:33, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ok. It would be much more helpful if any of you could tell me what you don't like. In particular, what facts does it leave out?

It's clear now that you have a direct personal interest in this article and are directly interested in discrediting them.

<dd>It doesn't represent an agreed upon "statement" because I don't agree with it. Moreover, I have already listed my objections and they've all been debated ad nauseam (literally!). However, I will list my main concerns for the sake of clarity.
<ul>
<li>The statement <i>"Professional medical and psychiatric organizations such as the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association and the National Association of Social Workers have not taken positions on ACT's work, although these groups do seek and use input from various other advocacy groups."</i> is not supported by the given references. It serves to discredit this organization and requires <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable sources</a>. As it lacks such sources, it doesn't belong in the article.</li>
<li>The statement <i>"The ACT defines Attachment Therapy as "the imposition of boundary violations - most often coercive restraint - and verbal abuse on a child, usually for hours at a time"..."</i> is blatantly wrong and needs to be changed.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I dispute the factual accuracy of the article, I dispute that the sources back up the claims, and I dispute the NPOV status of this article. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShotwell_e27f.html" title="User:Shotwell">shotwell</a> 05:22, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article represents a slowly built '<b>consensus</b>, that developed over a reasonable amount to time...just read the edit history and the talk page that preceeds all your edits...many of these issues have been carefully considered.</p>
<ol>
<li>The references and sources for the statement, <i>"Professional medical and psychiatric organizations such as the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association and the National Association of Social Workers have not taken positions on ACT's work, although these groups do seek and use input from various other advocacy groups."</i> clearly meet the Wikipedia Template:Verifiable standard and are quite clear...just follow the links and you, as several others have commented and found, will see.</li>
<li>The definition of "Attachment Therapy," is a direct quote from the ACT website...and from their book as well.</li>
<li>Just because you "dispute" a claim does not make it true. You have provided no Template:Verifiable evidence to the contrary while a number of others have provided Template:Verifiable evidence in support.</li>
<li>In the interests of consensus building...rather than merely stating what you don't like and deleting material without agreement, I'd suggest you make a specific suggestion in the last section set up for that purpose: put there what you propose indicating what you want added, deleted, and changed, and then other editors can comment. <a href="../../../d/p/e/User%7EDPeterson_3157.html" title="User:DPeterson"><font color="red">DPeterson</font></a><sup><a href="../../../d/p/e/User_talk%7EDPeterson_eca1.html" title="User talk:DPeterson">talk</a></sup> 17:36, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm quite relaxed actually. Although it is clearly listed above, I'll restate myself for the last time.
<ul>
<li>The statement "Professional medical and psychiatric organizations such as the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association and the National Association of Social Workers have not taken positions on ACT's work, although these groups do seek and use input from various other advocacy groups." is not supported by the given references.

<dd>I thus propose that the first statement be totally removed.

<dl>
<dd>I agree with both of shotwell's points. To elaborate on the first point, a citation to these organization's web sites does not prove that they "have not taken positions on ACT's work." The assumption seems to be that if something is not on their web site, it doesn't exist, which simply isn't true. To make a statement that they "have not taken a position," you would need to find a source that says "we have not taken a position." Furthermore, why does it matter if they have taken a position on ACT's work? There must be hundreds of advocacy groups out their that they have not "taken a position" on. They can't keep track of all of these groups and "take a position" on each one. So, I can't see the relevance of the fact that they have or have not taken a position on this particular group. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStokerAce_bfc5.html" title="User:StokerAce">StokerAce</a> 20:18, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I <b>DO NOT AGREE</b> with Shotwell's proposal. I think it is not based in fact and that the current material is factual, well-referenced and meets the Wikipedia standard as Template:Verifiable. However, if Shotwell has another proposal, let us see it and editors can comment. Maybe Shotwell would like to propose adding material about these seven criteria? I'd be very interested in seeing a specific proposal here. Please put your wording below. I think I might support such an addition...I will need to see your specific proposal and wording for that addition. More would be better. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonesRD_606d.html" title="User:JonesRD"><font color="DarkGreen">JonesRD</font></a><sub><a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJonesRD_1bab.html" title="User talk:JonesRD">talk</a></sub> 22:21, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Regarding Shotwell's proposal, '<b>I Disagree'</b> for the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The statements are <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verifiable.html" title="Verifiable">verifiable</a> and referenced adequately. This has repeatedly been shown in several of the sections above. I don't see why the issue keeps being raised by this person when it is so clear and has been addressed above.</li>

<dd>When my students use the word 'clear' it is usually because they are making an error. The validity of the citations is only argued ad nauseum above; that does not constitute an argument. Per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, the statement about ACT's affiliation with groups like the APA is not verified.

<dd>Actually, I think you may misunderstand the editing policy and procedures of Wikipedia. You are correct that no one owns an article or any part of one. However, it is common practice to suggest changes and edits on the talk page to build <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consensus.html" title="Consensus">consensus</a>. In that regard, DPeterson's suggestion is perfectly reasonable and one you should follow. My only question is, why would you not do just that?

<dd>Whether or not the seven criteria are added, I strongly insist that we change the passage about their definition. As I've shown above, it is not their definition. Moreover, this part of the article is just confusing. I would ideally propose replacing it and the confusing phrasing about the ambiguity surrounding the definition of AT with, "Although the definition of Attachment Therapy has no commonly agreed upon definition, ACT uses seven criteria to distinguish Attachment Therapy from other forms of psychotherapy." This is concise, easy to read, and verified. We'd reference the two claims in that sentence with the APSAC task-force report and ACT's own work. The APSAC task-force report states that the definition is ambiguous and that reference is the most authoritative reference in any of these AT articles. If that phrasing is not suitable, then I'd like to hear another idea that 1.) doesn't make the faulty claim about their definition of AT, and 2.) Says that they use seven criteria to distinguish AT. I'm neutral about whether or not those criteria are listed, so long as we don't misrepresent ACT and don't just copy/paste from their website. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShotwell_e27f.html" title="User:Shotwell">shotwell</a> 17:29, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It seems like we may find compromise on this single point. I really appreciate that we're working together on it. Here is an idea, why not change my proposed revision to suit your tastes? Anyone is allowed to edit that "article" despite it being in my userspace (anyone can generally edit anything here!) If one of us doesn't like the changes in the proposed article, then he can just revert. I don't think we'd find ourselves having an edit war over a temporary, unstable, and proposed revision of this article. Even if we did, I don't think it'd matter. If anyone does edit it, I'd recommend leaving the tag on top so that nobody confuses it for a real wikipedia article. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShotwell_Proposed_ACT_9138.html" title="User:Shotwell/Proposed ACT">User:Shotwell/Proposed ACT</a> <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShotwell_e27f.html" title="User:Shotwell">shotwell</a> 17:29, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I like your suggested edit, '<b>Althought the definition of attachment therapy has no commonly agreed upon definition, ACT uses seven criteria to distinguish attachment therapy from other forms of psychotherapy.'</b> What then would you write for the seven criteria? I'd like to see that part proposed here. However, I also think that their definition as quoted should also remain as this is their quote from their website...or a link from their website to this definition; so in either case, it is their definition. Now, if you want to suggest other edits here that would be much appreciated by me as a reader and sometime editor. I could then put my two cents in here and, I hope, contribute to building a consensus. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnsonRon_066c.html" title="User:JohnsonRon">JohnsonRon</a> 22:36, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Thank-you very much for giving us a helping hand. There are two very specific points that we're unable to compromise on.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>I do not believe that the sentence <i>"The ACT defines Attachment Therapy as "the imposition of boundary violations - most often coercive restraint - and verbal abuse on a child, usually for hour..."</i> is true. Specifically, I do not think that this is their definition. Mostly everyone else involved with this article thinks that it is true, yet I do not understand their reasoning. The quoted text is being taken from <a href="http://www.childrenintherapy.org/essays/overview.html" class="external text" title="http://www.childrenintherapy.org/essays/overview.html" rel="nofollow">Attachment Therapy: Child Abuse by Another Name</a>. It can be found under the heading "What Attachment Therapy is Like".</li>
<li>I do not believe the sentence <i>"Professional medical and psychiatric organizations such as the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association and the National Association of Social Workers have not taken positions on ACT's work..."</i> is properly sourced. The in-line citations point to the websites of these organizations. Those who disagree with me say that our inability to find a mention of ACT on those websites (despite the fact that these websites mention other organizations) shows that the claim is true. Hence, this is essentially a dispute about what constitutes a proper reference on wikipedia.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Some of the smaller points of contention (raised by me) have been.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The claims that Attachment therapy is ill-defined (I think that should just go in the <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attachment_therapy.html" title="Attachment therapy">Attachment therapy</a> article, while many disagree).</li>
<li>The <i>See Also</i> links that have already been linked to previously in the article (just a manual of style issue)</li>
<li>The part about membership statistics (I think it is being given undue weight)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I am generally willing to just ignore the smaller points because they don't seem that important. I'd just like to see some resolution on the larger issues.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShotwell_e27f.html" title="User:Shotwell">shotwell</a> 14:54, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I view this differently.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>The definition of attachment therapy by ACT is a direct link from their website to the other site and are their exact words. Therefore, it meets the Wikipedia standard of a <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verifiable.html" title="Verifiable">verifiable</a> fact. If you go to: <a href="http://www.childrenintherapy.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.childrenintherapy.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.childrenintherapy.org/</a> and then hit the third or fourth button at the bottom of their webpage you get to this definition.</li>
<li>Various large professional groups, such as the AMA, APA, APA, NASW, etc. have used material from other advocacy groups (the links are to their websites and also to pages of those sites showing where those groups used materials and accepted influence from various advocacy groups. ACT's purpose is to influence various groups, including those large professional groups (see the ACT mission), but have not been successful in that regard...there is no <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verifiable.html" title="Verifiable">verifiable</a> evidence that they have been successful.</li>
<li>There are many conflicting definitions of the term "attachment therapy." It is not part of the DSM IV, the AMA's CPT code book, or various other texts. If you search the web you will find various definitions for this term. Therefore statement that it is ill defined seems accurate.</li>
<li>The Also see section, as MANY other editors have noted, is a convenient place to put links for the reader so that the reader can easily find those links. There is no reason to not make it easier for the reader to find related articles.</li>
<li>Again, it is a fact that they do not publish membership stats...as a reader, that is of interest...if Shotwell prefers that that fact be included in another section and not it's own, that would be acceptable to me.</li>

First, there is no indication that ACT has tried to influence any of the listed organizations. Thus, I don't think it makes sense to state that these groups do not use ACT's information without evidence that ACT has lobbied them in any way. Second, how do we know they don't use ACT's information? The sources offered in support are just the organizations' web sites. They may very well use this information in materials that are not online. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStokerAce_bfc5.html" title="User:StokerAce">StokerAce</a> 18:51, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>The edited statement, is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'<b>While ACT seeks to influence various groups'</b>,professional medical and psychiatric organizations such as the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Medical_Association_5470.html" title="American Medical Association">American Medical Association</a>, the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Psychological_Association_357c.html" title="American Psychological Association">American Psychological Association</a>, the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Psychiatric_Association_f5df.html" title="American Psychiatric Association">American Psychiatric Association</a> and the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Association_of_Social_Workers_bd1a.html" title="National Association of Social Workers">National Association of Social Workers</a> have not taken positions on ACT's work '<b>and have not used it,'</b> although these groups do seek and use input from various other advocacy groups. (bold added to highlight addition).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems to be true that ACT seeks to influce various groups since they state that in their mission statement. It also seems true that the groups mentioned have not used input from ACT; however, I can see that this last element ("and have not used it"), while factually correct, may be best left out as we don't have specific evidence that ACT actually attempted this...so maybe only the first addition, "While ACT seeks to influence various groups," would be best to add if most others agree. <a href="../../../d/p/e/User%7EDPeterson_3157.html" title="User:DPeterson"><font color="red">DPeterson</font></a><sup><a href="../../../d/p/e/User_talk%7EDPeterson_eca1.html" title="User talk:DPeterson">talk</a></sup> 21:29, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In reading it again, I think a better word to use than "influence" would be to use their own word, "mobilize."

<p>Ok, the first thing I want to say about references: the "name" property of a <tt>&lt;ref ...&gt;</tt> tag is supposed to be a unique ID, so that if you want to add another instance of the same reference later in the article, you can just write <tt>&lt;ref name="same_id" /&gt;</tt>. If you give the same name to several <tt>&lt;ref&gt;</tt>, it doesn't work as intended.</p>
<p>So that's a technical thing, I fixed it, no problem. So to the serious issue. You can't say a thing like "APA has not taken position on ACT's work", and then include as a reference a link to the APA website. Seriously. That's silly. I'd remove these "references" in a heartbeat, but I understand there's been some edit warring going on and I don't want to be a part of that. I don't feel like reading this whole talk page right now, but let me just say what I assume many has said before: please remove this bit. It clearly is trying to say "ACT is a silly little organisation". Well, let me decide that. Don't insult the reader.

The advocacy group states as it's mission to inffluence various groups, such as APA, AMA, NASW, etc...but clearly has not been able to do so, although those groups do accept advocacy input from many other groups.

See, for example, <a href="http://www.kidscomefirst.info/vita99.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.kidscomefirst.info/vita99.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.kidscomefirst.info/vita99.pdf</a> I have listed other references in the article. Furthermore, the leaders, while listing all their various backgrounds and credentials on the ACT site, make no mention of being licensed to diagnose or treat mental health conditions or of having any experience practicing psychotherapy. <a href="../../../d/p/e/User%7EDPeterson_3157.html" title="User:DPeterson"><font color="red">DPeterson</font></a><sup><a href="../../../d/p/e/User_talk%7EDPeterson_eca1.html" title="User talk:DPeterson">talk</a></sup> 16:41, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I see your citations. You are correct that they do not hold themselves out to be mental health professionals on their website or anywhere else, including their bio's on their book jackets. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamDavidson_1ba9.html" title="User:SamDavidson">SamDavidson</a> 18:17, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
