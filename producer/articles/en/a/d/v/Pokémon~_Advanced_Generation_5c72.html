The goals and ambitions of <a href="../../../t/e/a/Team_Rocket_%28anime%29_a58c.html" title="Team Rocket (anime)">Team Rocket</a> are to rule the world by the exploitation and manipulation of Pokémon.

<ul>
<li><b>Jessie</b>: Vain and strong willed, Jessie shows that she is someone not to mess with. With a lonely past, and tough upbringing, Jessie has the strength and determination of one who is an independent woman. Her credentials in Team Rocket are ones that aren’t to be overlooked, however time and time again Jessie has failed in achieving various missions; namely that of capturing Pikachu. Jessie, James and Meowth have been assigned to the Hoenn region to collect information on rival Team Aqua and Team Magma.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>James</b>: Like her partner Jessie, James is a vain individual. However, the difference with James is that he exposes a more sensitive side to his character. Coming from a stable and rich family, James decided early on that the lifestyle of wealth wasn’t for him, thus deserting his family only to find himself in Team Rocket. Jessie, James and Meowth have been assigned to the Hoenn region to collect information on rival Team Aqua and Team Magma.</li>

<p>The standard 8 Gym Leaders of the Hoenn region are one of the toughest group yet. Throughout the Hoenn saga, Ash Ketchum will go toe to toe with some of the toughest trainers in all of Hoenn to battle his way to collect the 8 Gym Badges. Only then can Ash move on to the Hoenn League Champinoship.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Roxanne</b>: Roxanne is the Gym Leader of the Rustboro City Gym. Trainers who defeat her receive the Stonebadge. She is a scholar who specializes in Rock-type Pokémon. Ash battled Roxanne at the Gym while being filmed by some of Roxanne's students. Ash's Pikachu was able to defeat both of her Pokémon through a combination of pure electrical power and the Iron Tail technique, taking Roxanne by surprise.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Brawly</b>: Brawly is the Gym Leader of the Dewford Town Gym. Trainers who defeat him receive the Knucklebadge. He is a young man who specializes in Fighting-type Pokémon. After seeing Ash's battle against his star pupil, Brawly agreed to a rematch in a private arena- a wave-swept islet off the coast of Dewford.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Wattson</b>: Wattson is the Gym Leader of the Mauville City Gym. Trainers who defeat him receive the Dynamobadge. He is a jolly old man who specializes in Electric-type Pokémon. One of Wattson's tricks was a robotic Raikou that ended up super-charging the electricity in Pikachu. As a result, Ash's Pikachu was able to completely wipe out Wattson's team on its own, using a series of super-powerful Thunderbolts.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Flannery</b>: Flannery is the Hoenn region Gym Leader of the hot springs Gym in Lavaridge Town. She specializes in Fire-type Pokémon and gives out the Heatbadge when defeated. Ash has his Lavaridge Gym battle. In the battle, he uses his Corphish, Pikachu and Treecko. Despite Corphish being hit by a Yawn from Flannery's Slugma, Ash manages to defeat Torkoal and win the Heat Badge.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Norman</b>: Norman is the Gym Leader of the Petalburg City Gym. He is an expert of Normal-type Pokémon, and hands out the Balancebadge to Pokémon trainers who defeat him. Using his Grovyle, Pikachu, and Torkoal, Ash defeated Norman's Pokémon, much to Max's dismay. Max stole the Balance Badge and locked himself up in Norman's greenhouse. Norman was able to get Max under control and give Ash his Balance Badge.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Winona</b>: Winona is the Gym Leader of the Fortree City Gym. She specializes in Flying-type Pokémon and gives out the Featherbadge when beaten. Winona used Altaria, Pelipper and a "shiny" Swellow against Ash's Grovyle, Pikachu and his own Swellow. After a long (and, surprisingly, Team Rocket-less) battle, Ash won the Feather Badge from her.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Liza &amp; Tate</b>: Liza &amp; Tate are the Gym Leaders of the Mossdeep City Gym. They specialize in Psychic-type Pokémon. They give the Mindbadge to challengers who defeat them. Tate and Liza's father owns the Mosdeep Space Centre and often goes into space to search for space Pokémon. This means that they often spend time at the Space Centre, and even have battles in zero-gravity.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Juan</b>: Juan is the Gym Leader of the Sootopolis City Gym in Pokémon Emerald. He replaced Wallace, his (former) student, who in Emerald was moved up to the position of League Champion, replacing Steven. He gives the Rainbadge to those who defeat him. Juan trains Water-type Pokémon, and is quite the celebrity in anime Sootopolis, putting on shows with his Pokémon. In an intense battle, Ash managed to only marginally defeated Juan for his Rainbadge.</li>

<p>Like the Pokémon series, Pokémon: Advance Generation enjoyed 4 full length films. Like before, the films relied on the story telling of legendary Pokémon, and the promotion of upcoming Pokémon, such as those in Pokémon Diamond &amp; Pearl. With each Pokémon film raking up hefty sales not only in the box office (Japan), but on DVDs, there is no doubt that the Pokémon films will continue on throughout the generations! Listed below are the four featured length films, with a brief plotline analysis.</p>

<p>While Ash and his friends are at a carnival celebrating the appearance of the Millennium Comet, they befriend Jirachi, a Pokémon that awakens every thousand years alongside the comet. Of the trainers, it is Max who Jirachi becomes friendly with. However a former Team Magma scientist, working as a magician at the carnival, wishes to use Jirachi to bring forth Groudon.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in celebration of the Millennium Comet appearance, Ash Ketchum and company arrive at a festival where May buys a seven-panelled novelty that is said to grant a person one wish if a panel is closed for each night the comet appears. When Ash and Max accidentally volunteer for one of Butler's magic tricks, Max is introduced to Jirachi, who takes a liking to the main four.</p>

<p>A giant meteorite from space strikes in the Arctic. Arising from the crash-site is a Pokémon known as Deoxys. Feeling threatened, Rayquaza starts to attack the Pokémon while it was trying to revive a stone. The fight ends, however, when Rayquaza fires a point blank range Hyper Beam, vaporizing Deoxys except for its crystal core, which fell deep into the waters. The research team led by Professor Lund, whose camp was in the middle of the battle, takes the stone Deoxys was holding, and bring it with them on their return to La Rousse city.</p>
<p>Four years later, Ash and his friends arrive at La Rousse city, intent on battling in the city's famed Battle Tower. There, they run into Tory, the son of Professor Lund, who became afraid of Pokémon after being caught in the middle of a Walrein and Sealeo stampede caused by the meteor strike four years ago.</p>

Movie Eight</div>

<p>Hundreds of years ago, there was a large battle between Pokémon parties: Red and Green. In the present, in a small town named Rota, a yearly celebration is held commemorating this great battle. Ash, May, Brock and Max happen to come to this town during this time, and participate in a battle to decide who will be the "Hero of the Year." Ash and <a href="../../../p/i/k/Pikachu.html" title="Pikachu">Pikachu</a> win, but Mew snatches <a href="../../../p/i/k/Pikachu.html" title="Pikachu">Pikachu</a> and takes him to a mysterious tree-like structure, from which point the adventure unfolds.</p>
<p>At the festival, Ash competes in a tournament at Camaron Palace and wins, to become the "Aura Guardian" for that year. As part of the celebration, Ash is granted Aaron's staff, which contains his <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon.html" title="Pokémon">Pokémon</a> companion, <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucario.html" title="Lucario">Lucario</a>, whom Aaron had sealed before stopping the war. However, <a href="../../../p/i/k/Pikachu.html" title="Pikachu">Pikachu</a> is taken away by <a href="../../../m/e/w/Mew_%28Pok%C3%A9mon%29_a9c8.html" title="Mew (Pokémon)">Mew</a> when an adventurer named Kid attempts to put a tracker on the legendary Pokémon. Naturally Ash, with the help of <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucario.html" title="Lucario">Lucario</a>, follows Mew to the Tree of Beginning in order to rescue <a href="../../../p/i/k/Pikachu.html" title="Pikachu">Pikachu</a>.</p>

<p>Ash and Pikachu are lost in a wasteland and meet the star of the underwater Pokémon show, Hiromi. Hiromi is a descendant of a race of people who are able to communicate with the Water Pokémon, called the people of the water. They have a legend: somewhere in the oceans of the world is the Akūsha temple of the ocean, and in it is hidden a treasure called the crown of the ocean . However, no one has ever seen it.</p>
<p>Then, the Pokémon ranger Jack Walker, nicknamed Jackie, appears. Jackie is on a top-secret mission: to protect the egg of the prince of the sea Manaphy, and to deliver it to the temple of the ocean. Hiromi and Ash assist him in his mission and join him in his journey.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the pirate Phantom, who wants the egg, attacks them. Phantom plans to conquer the world using the power of the crown of the ocean, but it seems that Manaphy is needed to understand the mystery of the treasure. The hand of the high-tech mecha Phantom is piloting draws near... then, the egg glows brilliantly, and Manaphy hatches! What is the true form of the temple of the ocean? What is the legendary treasure? Will all the mysteries be understood when Manaphy's mysterious power is unleashed? Can Ash, Pikachu and Jackie complete this extremely difficult mission?</p>
