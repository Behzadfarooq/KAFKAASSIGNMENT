<dd>I think that the individual ranks are generally not encyclopedic and do not deserve their own articles. (I think we can make an exception for the Eagle rank, because it's something of an institution with importance beyond the arcana of BSA rank advancement.) However, I don't think that there needs to be an article on BSA ranks, because the section at <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boy_Scouts_of_America_a2b0.html" title="Boy Scouts of America">Boy Scouts of America</a> is probably sufficient.

<dd>I'm still not convinced that the individual ranks deserve their own articles. We could make an umbrella article for all seven, or maybe split out Eagle and combine the other six. --<a href="../../../s/m/a/User%7ESmack_b8c7.html" title="User:Smack">Smack</a> (<a href="../../../s/m/a/User_talk%7ESmack_cdf9.html" title="User talk:Smack">talk</a>) 18:57, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I'm wavering both ways. Eagle Scout deserves it's own article. The rank links at the bottom of each individual page is pretty neat, but not necessarily a reason to keep them. I suppose we could tighten up the requirements (they are rather detailed for this article) and add a bit of history. I probably won't start anything major here for a week or so, as I will be traveling. I have a few minor things to add. --<a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadget850_0012.html" title="User:Gadget850">Gadget850</a> 19:18, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>After perusing <a href="../../../l/o/n/Wikipedia%7ELong_article_layout_797f.html" title="Wikipedia:Long article layout">Long article layout</a>, perhaps we should keep all the articles and lay it out like <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Brazil_dbff.html" title="History of Brazil">History of Brazil</a>.

<dd><a href="../../../l/o/n/Wikipedia%7ELong_article_layout_797f.html" title="Wikipedia:Long article layout">Long article layout</a> advises against splitting medium-length articles into stubs. I don't think that these articles (with the exception of Eagle) can ever be more than stubs. It's not helpful to look at them in isolation; they only make sense as part of the progression of rank advancement. As for the requirements, I copied them verbatim from my Boy Scout Handbook, several years ago, assuming that they have some value in that form. They should probably be moved to Wikisource, or deleted altogether for copyright reasons. An exegetic treatment would be helpful. --<a href="../../../s/m/a/User%7ESmack_b8c7.html" title="User:Smack">Smack</a> (<a href="../../../s/m/a/User_talk%7ESmack_cdf9.html" title="User talk:Smack">talk</a>) 22:04, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Smack: See what I wrote in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Scouting_RulesStandards_b53f.html#Separate_articles" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Scouting/RulesStandards">Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Scouting/RulesStandards#Separate_articles</a> on 26 Jan. No one objected (perhaps you didn't see it). I wrote what I perceived to be a workable solution. Having said that, you and Gadget850 have a fundamental difference of opinion on this particular issue and it can't be done both ways. For me, my main goal on the rank articles is that the Pack, Troop, Crew ones be set up the same so there is a consistency, unity, and cohesion to them. And oh, we've all forgotten to mention VARSITY TEAMS. I think their ranks work like troops, and there aren't many of them, but we should mention them, perhaps in the troop rank article. <a href="../../../r/l/e/User%7ERlevse_2b5d.html" title="User:Rlevse">Rlevse</a> 11:14, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The discussion for this issue has spread across several talk pages, so I seem to have missed something. Please, let's be COURTEOUS and FRIENDLY and work this out. I know I explained my reasoning somewhere, but let's look at it again. First, take a look at these sample articles:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Class_Scout_rank_%28Boy_Scouts_of_America%29_fc45.html" title="First Class Scout rank (Boy Scouts of America)">First Class Scout rank (Boy Scouts of America)</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Hopefully, you can see where these are going. Not just the bare requirements, but also a background and a history to put it into context. The whole series still needs work, but I think it's a good start. One article covering all this information is going to be quite long, even if split by division. --<a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadget850_0012.html" title="User:Gadget850">Gadget850 ( Ed)</a> 12:17, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I think "list of..." should be changed to "adv and rec..." I like the way you have the parent article sectioned. Then perhaps one article per level pack/troop/crew with a rank overview as you've started, with the ranks for each level detailed in the sub article (pack/troop/crew). This would break it up in smaller pieces but also keep each rank out of a separate article. <a href="../../../r/l/e/User%7ERlevse_2b5d.html" title="User:Rlevse">Rlevse</a> 15:14, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As I get into the gestalt of the whole advancement program, I can see that as a whole, this is not going to work as one article. Here are some thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Move the new sections I wrote here and move them to the parent article.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>For example, copy<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_BSA_rank_requirements_85cc.html#Cub_Scouts" title="List of BSA rank requirements">List of BSA rank requirements#Cub Scouts</a> to <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cub_Scouts_%28Boy_Scouts_of_America%29_5dfe.html" title="Cub Scouts (Boy Scouts of America)">Cub Scouts (Boy Scouts of America)</a></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Take the separate rank articles and combine them into one (it's just going to be too long to fit in the parent article). Use the section as the lead-in. Take the requirements for each rank and really simplify them- get rid of the bullets.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>For example, create <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advancement_in_Cub_Scouts_%28Boy_Scouts_of_America%29_9402.html" title="Advancement in Cub Scouts (Boy Scouts of America)">Advancement in Cub Scouts (Boy Scouts of America)</a>, use the section from here as the lead, and combine Tiger through Webelos and Arrow of Light, and add the Academic and Sports Program.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Create main articles for each of the other award categories, and fold the sub-articles into it.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>For example, create <i>Service awards in the Boy Scouts of America</i>. Fold the short DESA and Silver Buffalo articles into it.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>We might just want a List of awards and recognition in the Boy Scouts of America to use as an overall view of things.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have read the above talk(s) and, while I think I may possibly almost nearly understand (not to be humble or anything), I want to check on something: We can have articles for specific ranks/awards as long as they are more than a skeleton-description?

<p>Can someone please provide some advice - the Varsity and Venturing information on this page is also covered on <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venturing_%28Boy_Scouts_of_America%29_718e.html" title="Venturing (Boy Scouts of America)">Venturing (Boy_Scouts_of_America)</a> and <a href="../../../v/a/r/Varsity_Scouts_0cc6.html" title="Varsity Scouts">Varsity Scouts</a>. I have tried to keep the information consistent across these pages, but it is definitely redundant AND it runs the risk of being edited on one article but not the other. How is a better way to do that? <a href="../../../n/t/h/User%7ENThurston_9c8d.html" title="User:NThurston">NThurston</a> 18:26, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Put a msg on Gadget850's talk page. He knows more about this than the rest of us. <a href="../../../r/l/e/User%7ERlevse_2b5d.html" title="User:Rlevse">Rlevse</a> 19:48, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The only doable way is to add a comment at the beginning of each section noting that the other article should be updated. I've been meaning to add this to each section, but I'm in a time crunch for the next week or so (Venturing and Wood Badge staff). --<a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadget850_0012.html" title="User:Gadget850">Gadget850 ( Ed)</a> 20:54, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks. I think I can get something that will work. <a href="../../../n/t/h/User%7ENThurston_9c8d.html" title="User:NThurston">NThurston</a> 22:11, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
