<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/v/Adventures_of_Sonic_the_Hedgehog_fde3.html" title="Edit section: Premise">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Premise</span></h2>
<p><i>Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog</i> is a fast-paced cartoon with much <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slapstick.html" title="Slapstick">slapstick</a> humour, akin to such shows as <i><a href="../../../r/e/n/Ren_and_Stimpy_d404.html" title="Ren and Stimpy">Ren and Stimpy</a></i> or <i><a href="../../../t/i/n/Tiny_Toon_Adventures_c0fe.html" title="Tiny Toon Adventures">Tiny Toons</a></i>. The show features very few recurring characters, usually just Sonic, Tails, Robotnik and his two hench-bots <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scratch_and_Grounder_0ef6.html" title="Scratch and Grounder">Scratch and Grounder</a> (with a third robot, <a href="../../../c/o/c/Coconuts_%28Sonic_the_Hedgehog%29_a982.html" title="Coconuts (Sonic the Hedgehog)">Coconuts</a>, appearing often) - however, there are many occasional minor characters and robots too. The plots often loosely follow the storyline of <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_series_07bb.html" title="Sonic the Hedgehog series">the video games series</a>, although when the cartoon began, the <i>Sonic</i> games were still quite new, and lacking much plot or character development, which was filled in by the show's writers.</p>
<p><i>Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog</i> was created by <a href="../../../d/i/c/DiC_Entertainment_ae12.html" title="DiC Entertainment">DiC Entertainment</a>, which produced a total of 65 episodes for its first season, and was syndicated by Bohbot Entertainment, now <a href="../../../b/k/n/BKN_cfdf.html" title="BKN">BKN</a> International (in the original run, every episode began and ended with the "Bohbot Entertainment Presents" logo). The first episode was "Best Hedgehog" (actually episode 13 in production order, shown <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_6.html" title="September 6">September 6</a>) and the last was "Hero of the Year" (episode 60 in production order, shown <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_3.html" title="December 3">December 3</a>). DiC ceased production on this comical interpretation to spend more time on its darker interpretation, dubbed just <i><a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_%28TV_series%29_fa83.html" title="Sonic the Hedgehog (TV series)">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></i> (commonly known as <i>SatAM</i> by fans), a series launched on <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Broadcasting_Company_349c.html" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC's</a> Saturday morning line-up.</p>
<p>After the original airing, DiC created one more episode in the winter of <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996_in_television.html" title="1996 in television">1996</a>, "<a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_Christmas_Blast_7813.html" title="Sonic Christmas Blast">Sonic Christmas Blast</a>", which has features from <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_%28TV_series%29_fa83.html" title="Sonic the Hedgehog (TV series)">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> such as <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Sally_6275.html" title="Princess Sally">Princess Sally</a> in a non-speaking cameo, and has Sonic and Tails visiting Robotropolis, which has a human population and a name pronounced with two "T"s. The letters page of issue #41 of the <i><a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_%28Archie_comic%29_3acf.html" title="Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie comic)">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></i> <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic_book.html" title="Comic book">comic book</a> promotes the special as "An X-Tremely Sonic Christmas", suggesting that it was originally intended to promote <i><a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_X-treme_3c84.html" title="Sonic X-treme">Sonic X-treme</a></i>, a <a href="../../../s/e/g/Sega_Saturn_833e.html" title="Sega Saturn">Sega Saturn</a> game which was eventually cancelled due to numerous problems in development; the special's name was changed to match the game that <i>did</i> come out, <i><a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_3D_Blast_5453.html" title="Sonic 3D Blast">Sonic 3D Blast</a></i>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/v/Adventures_of_Sonic_the_Hedgehog_fde3.html" title="Edit section: Characters">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Characters</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Breezie</b> - Breezie Hedgebot Robotnik was a voluptuous <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robot.html" title="Robot">robot</a> who first appeared in the episode "Lovesick Sonic", saved by Sonic, who fell in love with her. However, she was really a robot built by <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Robotnik_cb12.html" title="Dr. Robotnik">Dr. Robotnik</a> as a trap for the hero. Breezie however found she could not eliminate Sonic, caring too much for him. She also decided that despite these feelings, their relationship would not work. Breezie later fell in love with Robotnik Jr., another of Robotnik's creations. However, she seemed to retain some feelings for Sonic even after this.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Da Bears</b> - Big Griz and Big Mike, together otherwise known as "Da Bears", are two less-than-intelligent bears who claim to be Sonic's biggest fans. While rather thick, Da Bears are skilled drivers and are determined to help out Sonic in any way they can.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Lucas and Lucinda</b> - Lucas and Lucinda were teenage lovers featured in the episode "Best Hedgehog". According to a flashback by Lucas shown within, they were lab partners in <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_school.html" title="High school">high school</a>; Robotnik didn't take kindly to this, as he also had unrequited romantic feelings for Lucinda. When he attempted to "take care of" Lucas using a robot snake and promise Lucinda "a quarter of everything [he would] plunder", it only got him expelled. After building his fortress, Robotnik imprisoned Lucas. Sonic later reunites them and attends their wedding as the <a href="../../../b/e/s/Best_man.html" title="Best man">best man</a>, hence the episode's title.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Miss Possum</b> - A sweet (and short) lady possum, she was Sonic &amp; Tails' friend in the town of Tranquil Gulch, who brought them to the town to sort out its problems there. Once they were cleared up, she was made Sheriff.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Prince Charnock and Splorg</b> - Prince Charnock and Splorg are special guest stars who appear in "Close Encounters of the Sonic Kind". Charnock is a green lizard-like alien with a squid-like head, while Splorg is a floating spectacled red blob resembling a red blood cell. Charnock is on vacation and seems to be a bit of an idiot, while Splorg is smart, pompous and arrogant. The two crash-land their ship on Mobius thanks to Robotnik's new Electro-Suction Plate, while on their way back to their homeplanet of Rhombus. Charnock is supposed to be crowned king of the planet in just two hours, but their ship is now in pieces. It also revealed that Charnock is on vacation, but if he cannot reach his coronation in time, his unnamed baby brother will become king and destroy Mobius.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Professor Von Schlemmer</b> - Professor Von Schlemmer is a kooky scientist that has orange hair and green skin. When Sonic or Tails are in danger, they sometimes see him for a device which he invents that can stop Robotnik or find each other such as when Sonic was trapped in a temple in the episode <i>Tails' Tale</i>. However Professor Von Schlemmer sometimes forgets his name in a few episodes and asks himself who is he, which Sonic or Tails reply that he is Von Schlemmer. Some of his inventions include Gizmo Gas (makes an object grow), Dream-ma-ma-jig (can get dreams into the real world) and Portable Dream-ma-ma-jig (same as Dream-ma-ma-jig except smaller and looks like a night cap).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Santa Claus</b> - This version of <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Claus_71fe.html" title="Santa Claus">Santa Claus</a> lives on Sonic's home planet of <a href="../../../m/o/b/Mobius_%28Sonic_the_Hedgehog%29_2e4b.html" title="Mobius (Sonic the Hedgehog)">Mobius</a>, with the familiar task of delivering presents to children on <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_Eve_b7d8.html" title="Christmas Eve">Christmas Eve</a>. He appeared in <i><a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_Christmas_Blast_7813.html" title="Sonic Christmas Blast">Sonic Christmas Blast</a></i>, in which <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Robotnik_cb12.html" title="Dr. Robotnik">Dr. Robotnik</a> planned to steal Christmas and rule the world. Santa apparently announced his retirement, but in truth he had been replaced by Metal Claus, a dimwitted robot who was only programmed to say things revolving around Christmas. Robotnik held Santa captive in a nearby mountain, but Sonic was there to rescue Santa and foil Robotnik's plan. As a gift, Santa gave his job to Sonic, and Christmas was saved.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Wes Weasley</b> - Mobius's number one salesman/con artist. Wes Weasley is often recognized for his yellow suit and his merchandise of questionable quality. Being a salesman, Wes doesn't really care who's buying from him, so long as he gets his pay. He's quick to leave if things start going wrong however.</li>

<p>There were 6 VHS tapes released in the US with 2 episodes each per tape. In the UK, there were about 10 tapes released; Volumes 1 to 6 (except Volume 5 which is Quest for the Chaos Emeralds, a 4 parter edited without the title cards) had 3 episodes per tape, High Stakes Sonic/Sonic Breakout and Momma Robotnik's Birthday tapes had 2 episodes each. Also there was a bumper tape released that was roughly 3 hours long. None of the UK videos had the Sonic Says segments included except the episode High Stakes Sonic. It is worth noting that one of these UK videos had four different versions. All of these four had the episode "Sonic Breakout in it." However, in one the other episode was "High Stakes Sonic." In another it was "Slowwww Going" and the final version had all three of these episodes. Also there was a tape with just the Sonic Breakout episode. Also in France there were a few VHS releases by Sony Music. <a href="http://cartoonsvhs.free.fr/index.php?page=a" class="external autonumber" title="http://cartoonsvhs.free.fr/index.php?page=a" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
