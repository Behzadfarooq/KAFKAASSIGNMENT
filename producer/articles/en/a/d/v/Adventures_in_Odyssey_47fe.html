<p>The idea of <i>AIO</i> began in the mid-1980s with Steve Harris, then Coordinator of Promotion with Focus on the Family's Broadcasting Department. The VP of Focus on the Family along with other production staff were discussing ideas for the upcoming Christmas broadcasts when Steve Harris suggested a radio drama. Harris, with consent of Focus on the Family executives Mike Trout and Bobbie Valentine, decided to produce a <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas.html" title="Christmas">Christmas</a>-themed radio drama called "Spare Tire" for airing during the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a> holiday season. The drama, which featured only two actors, was a "smashing success", <sup><a href="#Notes" title="">1</a></sup> and paved the way for a second and third Christmas drama, the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a> "House Guest" and the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a> "Gone Fishin'". Both of these dramas included actor <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hal_Smith_%28actor%29_bbd6.html" title="Hal Smith (actor)">Hal Smith</a>, who would later portray <i>AIO</i> main character <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Avery_Whittaker_88f4.html" title="John Avery Whittaker">John Avery Whittaker</a>, and Chuck Bolte, who would portray <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Adventures_in_Odyssey_characters_5ac1.html#George_Barclay" title="List of Adventures in Odyssey characters">George Barclay</a>.</p>
<p>In the spring of <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>, Focus on the Family founder <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Dobson_fefe.html" title="James Dobson">James Dobson</a> interviewed <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Wilkinson_6bf8.html" title="Bruce Wilkinson">Bruce Wilkinson</a> on the subject of <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_media.html" title="Mass media">media</a> influence in modern society. Wilkinson persuaded Dobson that complaining about media programming was not enough -- that Christians should produce their own programming as a replacement.</p>
<p>In response, Dobson called on Steve Harris to launch a radio series. Focus on the Family hired <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phil_Lollar_3e46.html" title="Phil Lollar">Phil Lollar</a>, a filmmaker and screenwriter, and Harris and Lollar began to work on creating the program, but disagreements abounded concerning the show's format. Initial plans for a <a href="../../../v/a/r/Variety_show.html" title="Variety show">variety show</a> faded; eventually, the two decided on a "30-minute weekly drama/comedy program set in a small town, centering on the problems, foibles, antics, relationships, and goings-on of the people with the town."<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_completeguide1"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/d/v/Adventures_in_Odyssey_47fe.html#endnote_completeguide1" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/d/v/Adventures_in_Odyssey_47fe.html#endnote_completeguide1" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></sup></span></p>
<p>The two then established the setting, disagreeing on <a href="../../../o/r/e/Oregon.html" title="Oregon">Oregon</a> or <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio.html" title="Ohio">Ohio</a> (but selecting the latter). Lollar named the town "<a href="../../../o/d/y/Odyssey_%28fictional_town%29.html" title="Odyssey (fictional town)">Odyssey</a>" after seeing <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_F._Buckley_6696.html" title="William F. Buckley">William F. Buckley</a>'s <i>United Nations Journal: A Delegate's Odyssey</i> on his bookshelf. Next, the name of the program's main character was chosen: <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Avery_Whittaker_88f4.html" title="John Avery Whittaker">John Avery Whittaker</a>. "<a href="../../../w/h/i/Whit%27s_End_3930.html" title="Whit's End">Whit's End</a>" was created, and Lollar wrote detailed histories and descriptions of Odyssey, John Avery Whittaker, and Whit's End. By mid-<a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>, Focus on the Family approved the show's description, and hired a new writer, Susan McBride. In early fall, Focus on the Family decided to finance a 13-episode test series, <i>Family Portraits</i>, which would determine whether the idea would fly or fail. Harris, Lollar, and McBride wrote the pilot episode, FP1: "Whit's Visitor" during November 1986; it was produced by Focus on the Family's Bob Luttrell in December 1986, and aired on January 5, 1987.</p>
<p>Focus on the Family received over 4,000 positive responses from listeners, fueling the show's development. Joe Glauberg, a staff writer for <i><a href="../../../h/a/p/Happy_Days_98db.html" title="Happy Days">Happy Days</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../m/o/r/Mork_and_Mindy_5009.html" title="Mork and Mindy">Mork and Mindy</a></i>, was brought in to help generate creative direction. The final <i>Family Portraits</i> episode, FP13: "A Simple Addition", aired on April 13, 1987, leaving the entire summer for Harris and Lollar to move the series from testing stage to full-time production.</p>
<p>Over the summer of 1987, production moved, along with the rest of Focus on the Family, from <a href="../../../a/r/c/Arcadia%2C_CA_10ef.html" title="Arcadia, CA">Arcadia</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a> to <a href="../../../p/o/m/Pomona%2C_CA_767a.html" title="Pomona, CA">Pomona</a>. The new show, called <i>Odyssey USA</i> (<i>OUSA</i>), retained only two main characters from <i>Family Portraits</i>: <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Avery_Whittaker_88f4.html" title="John Avery Whittaker">John Avery Whittaker</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Riley_6875.html" title="Tom Riley">Tom Riley</a>; the pilot, 1: "Whit's Flop", premiered on November 21, 1987.</p>
<p><a name="The_First_Decade_-_1986_to_1996" id="The_First_Decade_-_1986_to_1996"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/v/Adventures_in_Odyssey_47fe.html" title="Edit section: The First Decade - 1986 to 1996">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The First Decade - 1986 to 1996</span></h3>
<p>The first major change in <i>Odyssey USA</i> occurred in April 1988, after only 24 episodes of the new program. Focus on the Family Broadcasting VP Mike Trout argued that the inclusion of "USA" in the program's name would alienate listeners outside the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> (and, in particular, in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>). Thus, the show's name was changed to <i>Adventures in Odyssey</i>. (All back episodes of <i>OUSA</i> were relabeled.)</p>
<p>The program also gained recurring characters, a feature that <i>Family Portraits</i> lacked (other than Whit). Most important were the introductions of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connie_Kendall_8bce.html" title="Connie Kendall">Connie Kendall</a>, <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugene_Meltsner_ab61.html" title="Eugene Meltsner">Eugene Meltsner</a>, and the Barclay family, as well as more appearances of <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Riley_6875.html" title="Tom Riley">Tom Riley</a>. A few <i>Family Portraits</i> episodes were rewritten and aired as <i>AIO</i> episodes with similar stories but different characters.</p>
<p>The program also took many creative leaps and bounds almost right from the start. The show saw 29 albums released in that time starting with "Family Portraits" and ending with "Welcome Home." Within that time many story arcs were introduced including the infamous <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackgaard_saga.html" title="Blackgaard saga">Blackgaard saga</a>, the conversion of Connie, and the history of Eugene.</p>
<p>The first decade -- lasting through December <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a> -- saw production of 372 <i>AIO</i> episodes</p>

<p>After 10 years of non stop production, the format and schedule of production needed a change. Therefore, a break was called and from December 1996 to September 1997 production halted on Adventures In Odyssey.</p>
<p>When the show came back there were three significant changes.</p>
<p>First, was that Hal Smith had obviously passed on and Paul Herlinger took over the voice of John Avery Whittaker. The First Decade had ended with Whit making a very welcome return to Odyssey and it seemed the perfect place to step back and brain storm about where the show would go from there.</p>
<p>Secondly, almost all of the normal child actors were not brought back including Kurt, Isaac, Oscar, and Lucy. The only surviving "child" was Rodney Rathbone. Other main characters were brought back such as Tom and Connie. All of the old story lines had been wrapped up and it was time to introduce new characters or flush out the newer ones such as Jack and Jason, to make the show more fresh and hopefully more accessible to new listeners.</p>
<p>Finally, production turned into a system more like television complete with a season premiere and finale.</p>
<p>There was also a hiatus from November 1998 to September 1999, though four new episodes aired in the spring of 1999.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/v/Adventures_in_Odyssey_47fe.html" title="Edit section: Officer David Harley">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Officer David Harley</span></h3>
<p>One of the most controversial decisions made on the show was involving a character by the name of Officer David Harley played by <a href="../../../w/i/l/Will_Ryan_9ac0.html" title="Will Ryan">Will Ryan</a> (who also voices Eugene Meltsner).</p>
<p>He made his first appearance in the third AIO episode, "Lights Out at Whit's End." His final appearance was on an unreleased 2 part arc called "The Return of Harley."</p>
<p>His character was one of a local Police Officer that was not too bright but with a good heart and good intentions. His appearance on the show caused a large amount of response from parents concerned about how his persona would send the wrong message about real police officers and his character was later dropped with little or no explanation as far as the show plot goes.</p>
<p>The majority of the shows that Officer Harley appeared in were later re-recorded and re-aired under different titles with another character, Harlow Doyle: Private Eye who was again voiced by Will Ryan. Other episodes had the character of Eugene replacing Officer Harley. If an episode was not redone, it was not released at all.</p>
<p>Later on when a demand for the original episodes to be re-released came up, an album called "The Early Classics" was released in 1996. It featured many of the original episodes with new intros and outtros by Chris along with the re-recording of other episodes to remove Officer Harley. To this day no Officer Harley episodes have been officially released and the original albums are something of a collector's piece.</p>
<p>The main lesson that people learned was that Focus on the Family listened to their listeners by removing Officer Harley and later bringing him back in the form of Harlow Doyle.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/v/Adventures_in_Odyssey_47fe.html" title="Edit section: Whither Whit?">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Whither Whit?</span></h3>
<p>The most significant change to <i>AIO</i> came in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>, when <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hal_Smith_%28actor%29_bbd6.html" title="Hal Smith (actor)">Hal Smith</a> died of a <a href="../../../m/y/o/Myocardial_infarction.html" title="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</a>. With that, the voice of the <i>AIO</i> main character was gone.</p>
<p>Of course, a number of yet-unaired episodes had been recorded, giving the <i>AIO</i> writers time to plan a course of action. Starting in episode #274: "First-Hand Experience", two of the show's main characters, Eugene and Bernard, left on a trip to <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>. This six-episode arc, which followed Eugene and Bernard's trip, gave the writers over a month to decide the fate of Whit back in Odyssey.</p>
<p>Eugene and Bernard arrive back in Odyssey in episode #280: "Gone . . .", learning that Whit has taken a position in <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a> with the Universal Press Foundation's Missions Board, and that due to the urgent nature of the vacancy, Whit is scheduled to leave that day. Eugene and Bernard race to the airport, only to find that Whit has just departed. The episode uses several clips of Whit from past episodes, in addition to clips of a tape Hal Smith sent to the <i>AIO</i> staff shortly after the death of his wife, to create the scenes with Whit.</p>
<p>Whit returned to Odyssey in 1996; since that time, he has been voiced by Paul Herlinger.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/v/Adventures_in_Odyssey_47fe.html" title="Edit section: New Directions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">New Directions</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>The "Split" era</li>
</ul>
<p>The "Split" era refers to a time period in AIO history when the producers were searching for a new Whit. In 1994, After Hal Smith died, the character of John Avery Whitaker was sent to the Middle East so the producers could find a new actor to play Whit. To fill the void Whit left, two new characters were introduced. Jason Whitaker, Whit's son, portrayed the adventurous side of Whit. He also possesed Whit's inventing skills. Whit's wisdom and faith were found in the other new character, Jack Allen. Jack and Whit were lifelong friends, and Jack took over Whit's "grandfatherly" attributes, aiding the kids in moral dilemas and being the spiritual leader of the gang at Whit's End. The attributes of Whit were split between Jason and Jack and the show continued on.</p>
<ul>
<li>Departure of Will Ryan</li>
</ul>
<p>Between 2000 and 2005 the character of Eugene was nowhere to be found. While he was involved in the Novacom saga, he never actually spoke during these shows. Only things about him were mentioned, like the fact that his apartment had been ransacked (Plan-B; Missing in Action). This abscene of Eugene was due to the absence of Will Ryan, the actor who played Eugene. While it is not known (to the public) why Will Ryan went on this hiatus, one can guess it may have dealt with contractial issues or family problems. Eugene and Will Ryan returned in 2005 in "A Most Intriguing Question." The absence of Eugene was explained by saying that he and Katrina had toured the world. Eugene has been on the show steadily since that date.</p>
<ul>
<li>Novacom and new directions</li>
</ul>
<p>The Novacom saga was a major series in AIO. The saga lasted between 2000 and 2002. It dealt with the evil doings of a TV company named Novacom, Andromeda (the parent company), and all of their minions such as Dr. Charles. They planned on using mind control to rule the world (clearly showing the view of the AIO writers and producers). During this saga, Whit opened a new Whit's End in Connellsville. Many new character were introduced then cut after the series ended in the spring of '02. During this series, Robert Mitchell (Mitch), who was allegedly murdered, but later found to be alive, was introduced and he and Connie became a couple. Cal Johnson (Alex Jefferson's cousin) was also introduced. Jason Whitaker became a more prominent character, but after the end of the Novacom series, he returned to his minor role that he had before the series began. Cal and Mitch exited soon after the end of the Novacom series as well. Aubrey and the Shepard family also were cut after this Novacom saga. Another major outcome from the saga was the tone of the show. The Novacom series was very mature for the usually young audience (7-11 yrs. old.) While the Novacom saga is a favorite of many Odyssey fans young and old, AIO has been quite different ever since. In general the tone has been much more light hearted with little of the intrigue found in during the Novacom days.</p>
<ul>
<li>Changing of Connie</li>
</ul>
<p>Connie Kendall has had several personalities during the AIO history. Early on in the series, she was a very rebellious teen. She had a lot of spunk and rebellion as many teens do. After she became a Christian in the early 90s, she was still spunky, but better behaved and more intent on doing God's will. After the Novacom series and her failed relationship with Mitch, she has become very different. In great contrast to her early days, current Connie is very whiny and weak. She is low on self-confidence and feels that she has no greater purpose. She now does little other than work, with no friends other than the kids or employees at Whit's End. It seems as though the character has grown old, not in age but in freshness, and the writers have found little to give her a new angle.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/v/Adventures_in_Odyssey_47fe.html" title="Edit section: Format">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Format</span></h3>
<p><i>AIO</i> is atypical in that it does not fall cleanly into either comedy or melodrama category, and episode plots range from the farcical (e.g., #440: "I Slap Floor") to the extremely serious (e.g., #499, "Exit"). In all, approximately one-third of all episodes fall in the purely comic category, a third in the purely dramatic category, and the remaining third are hybrid. However, all episodes are written to convey some <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moral.html" title="Moral">moral</a>, and a <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> reference verse, and are written to be both entertaining and acceptable to all age groups.</p>
<p>Most radio episodes are written to fit in a half-hour broadcast window, though it is not uncommon for a single episode to span multiple half-hour segments, divided into numbered parts (each carrying their own production number). To date, there have been <a href="../../../6/4/_/64_%28number%29.html" title="64 (number)">64</a> multi-part episodes, with the four-part "Plan B" the largest (episode #484, #485, #486, &amp; #487). Major storylines, as with other melodramas, span numerous episodes. The Novacom saga, for example, spans 29 episodes, originally aired over a 20-<a href="../../../m/o/n/Month.html" title="Month">month</a> timeframe.</p>
<p>Initially, each <i>AIO</i> episode began and ended with a short story segment, usually around two minutes total, involving the program's host, Chris. (Chris seemed to exist in both the real world and in the fictional <i>AIO</i> universe.) These "wrap-arounds" introduced and highlighted the subject of the episode; at the end, Chris would give the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> verses supporting the theme of the particular episode, as well as production credits and, occasionally, contact information for Focus on the Family. Eventually, it was decided that these wrap-arounds had become so elaborate that they detracted from the main story and Odyssey plotline, and starting in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>, Chris's role was reduced to a brief introduction ("Hi, this is Chris. Welcome to <i>Adventures in Odyssey</i>!"), followed by John Campbell's <i>AIO</i> music theme. However, Chris retained the role of concluding each episode with a recapitulation and biblical reference. In multi-part episodes, Chris introduces the later segments by introducing select informative soundbites ("Last time, on <i>Adventures in Odyssey</i> . . .).</p>
<p>Another change to the introduction came shortly thereafter: Chris's welcome statement was overlaid onto the musical theme, followed by a welcome from main character <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Avery_Whittaker_88f4.html" title="John Avery Whittaker">John Avery Whittaker</a>, after which a selection of <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soundbite.html" title="Soundbite">soundbites</a> from the episode were <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/juxtaposed" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:juxtaposed">juxtaposed</a> to create a (usually) comedic preview of the episode.</p>
<p>This format has remained, albeit with a few minor changes. First, beginning with the 1994 episode "Second Thoughts", various characters followed Chris in welcoming listeners to the program (a change originating when the character of "Whit" was absent from the show from <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>). Second, beginning with episode #144, "Someone to Watch Over Me", the <i>AIO</i> theme and welcome sequence was moved to follow the opening scene in select episodes, similar to most modern-day television melodramas and sitcoms. Third, voice acting credits were added to engineering credits read by Chris at the show's conclusion.</p>
<p>The only other experiment regarding the <i>AIO</i> format began with episodes #428a, "The Eternal Birthday" and #428b, "Imaginary Friend", two quarter-hour episodes designed to air within the same half-hour time slot. Each "half-episode" was independent of the other, and generally tended to the comical because of the limited development possible in a shorter time frame. After ten such "splits", the idea was abandoned (<i>AIO</i> fans claimed splits catered to a declining attention span among youth.) <a href="http://www.aiohq.com/album/34.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aiohq.com/album/34.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>
<p>The current format, for most episodes, is thus:</p>
<ol>
<li>Musical theme</li>
<li>Chris's introductory welcome</li>
<li>Introduction from a character</li>
<li>Soundbite preview of the episode</li>
<li>Episode, with two commercial breaks</li>
<li>Chris's conclusion, with episode summary, moral take-away, Bible reference, and voice, engineering, writing, and production credits</li>
</ol>
<p>The timespan of individual <i>AIO</i> episodes also varies greatly. The shortest episode is 223: "Real Time"; the episode covers events that take place in approximately twenty-two minutes of Odyssey time (the actual episode is 22 minutes, 51 seconds long). However, other episodes contain events in Odyssey that may occur over more than a month, for example, 182: "The Scales of Justice" and 202: "Timmy's Cabin".</p>

<p><i>AIO</i> is in a relatively unique position. Most radio dramas were popular before the advent of inexpensive and convenient recording and playback formats, and back episodes were never released. <i>AIO</i>, however, began near the end of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compact_audio_cassette.html" title="Compact audio cassette">cassette tape</a> era, and <a href="../../../f/o/c/Focus_on_the_Family_c475.html" title="Focus on the Family">Focus on the Family</a> decided to use that medium to create albums of <i>AIO</i> episodes, a decade before the custom became popular of releasing TV series on <a href="../../../d/v/d/DVD_1991.html" title="DVD">DVD</a>. The early albums contained six cassette tapes, with two episodes per tape, and were the primary release format through <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>, with most of the first 208 episodes released exclusively on cassette (a few remain unreleased to this day).</p>
<p>In 1993, the 16th <i>AIO</i> album, <i>Flights of Imagination</i>, was released for both audio cassette and on four <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compact_disc.html" title="Compact disc">CDs</a>. Dual-release, on both cassette and CD, remains the strategy to date, with all nearly all episodes since #209, "Columbus: The Grand Voyage", available on both audio cassette and CD.</p>
<p>In 2006 Focus on the Family said that album 45 would be the last album to be released on both cassette and CD, limiting future releases to CD only.</p>

<p><i>AIO</i> reflects the beliefs and stances of its parent organization, <a href="../../../f/o/c/Focus_on_the_Family_c475.html" title="Focus on the Family">Focus on the Family</a>, a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">U.S.</a>-based <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interdenominationalism.html" title="Interdenominationalism">interdenominational</a>, <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evangelicalism.html" title="Evangelicalism">evangelical</a> non-profit organization. All episodes are based on a certain <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scripture.html" title="Scripture">scriptural</a> reference, though the inclusion may range from simply the Chris's thematic summary at the end of the program, to the religious topic being discussed throughout the episode. Some episodes deal with general moral principles, such as <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honesty.html" title="Honesty">honesty</a> or <a href="../../../t/r/u/Trust_%28sociology%29.html" title="Trust (sociology)">trust</a>, with little reference to <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> in particular (for example, #158: "A License to Drive"). Others, however, concern <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctrinal.html" title="Doctrinal">doctrinal</a> topics such as <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christology.html" title="Christology">Christology</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salvation.html" title="Salvation">Salvation</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spiritual_warfare.html" title="Spiritual warfare">Spiritual warfare</a>, and so forth (for example, #357, "The Search for Whit, part 3"; #330, "The Time Has Come"; and, #122-#123, "Castles and Cauldrons, parts 1-2", respectively). Most, though not always all, of the protagonists are <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christians.html" title="Christians">Christians</a>, and prayers and church events are regularly included in episodes. However, denominational issues are not considered. For example, most <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> characters attend churches with such nondenominational names as "Odyssey Community Church" and "Odyssey Bible Church".</p>
<p>In addition, the principle of <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_inerrancy.html" title="Biblical inerrancy">Biblical inerrancy</a> is ascribed to most of the protagonists, especially <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Avery_Whittaker_88f4.html" title="John Avery Whittaker">John Avery Whittaker</a>.

"Whit", as he is called by most friends (<a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugene_Meltsner_ab61.html" title="Eugene Meltsner">Eugene Meltsner</a> a notable and consistent exception), is a <a href="../../../w/i/d/Widower.html" title="Widower">widower</a> with a varied history, a history that often plays into episodes.

He and his late wife Jenny moved to Odyssey approximately ten years before the setting of the pilot episode of <i>AIO</i>.</p>

Connie appeared in Odyssey in episode #4, "Connie Comes to Town", as a junior-high student. After graduating in episode #405, "The Graduate", she decided to continue to work at "Whit's End" full-time. Eugene, who first appeared as a college student in episode #51, "Connie, Part 1", began an internship at Whit's End while attending Campbell College. In recent years, his fellowship with the college has given him less opportunity to work at Whit's End, and the sensitive nature of his research caused him to flee Odyssey in the midst of the Novacom saga. After much soul-searching, Eugene returned to Odyssey in episode #564, "A Most Intriguing Question (Part 1)".</p>

<li>Connie</li>
</ul>
<p>The first multi-part plot arc of <i>AIO</i> concerns Connie Kendall. Connie, a teenager from California, moves to Odyssey in episode #4: "Connie Comes to Town", and takes a job at "Whit's End". Through the first season, there is a significant amount of tension between Connie's areligious belief and the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> of Whit and Tom. Over time, Connie softens to Christianity, and becomes a Christian at the end of the two-part episode "Connie" (#51 &amp; #52).</p>
<ul>
<li>Blackgaard saga</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Main article:</i> <b><a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackgaard_saga.html" title="Blackgaard saga">Blackgaard saga</a></b></p>
<p>The "Blackgaard saga" is the definitive <i>AIO</i> storyline, with its roots first mentioned in #19, "Recollections", and its <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encore.html" title="Encore">encore</a> in #424 &amp; #425, "Blackgaard's Revenge, parts 1 &amp; 2". Thus, the saga was broadcast over a total of 11 years. The saga includes the 11-part <i>Darkness Before Dawn</i> series, originally broadcast in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>.</p>
<p>The saga recounts the ongoing battle between John Avery Whittaker and his nemesis, Dr. Regis Blackgaard, over two different items: first, a computer program Whittaker developed for the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Security_Agency_8130.html" title="National Security Agency">National Security Agency</a> named "Applesauce", and second, a mineral found beneath "Whit's End" that forms the active ingredient in the enzyme TA-418, a chemical weaponizer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Barclay saga</li>
</ul>
<p>Another ongoing storyline in <i>AIO</i> concerns the Barclay family's direction following father George Barclay's unemployment. In the Barclay saga, George Barclay is led into the ministry, and the Barclay family eventually moves from Odyssey to the small town of Pokenberry Falls.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Search for Whit</li>
</ul>
<p>Roughly a year following John Avery Whittaker accepting the position in the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_East_c1c7.html" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>, a series of strange, unclear messages reach Odyssey, essentially making it seem evident that Whit has disappeared and may be in danger. Jason and Eugene embark on a mission to find him, and eventually do (presumably because the producers found a suitable recast for Whit's voice).</p>
<ul>
<li>Eugene And Katrina</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most popular plot arcs in <i>AIO</i> concerns Eugene Meltsner's relationship with Katrina Shanks. Eugene and Katrina's relationship was plagued by numerous miscommunications and misunderstandings, which were largely a result of Eugene's lack of experience when it came to matters of the heart.</p>
<ul>
<li>"Meltsner Arc"</li>

</ul>
<p>A mysterious man named Malachi comes to Odyssey and claims to be an <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angel.html" title="Angel">angel</a>. Seemingly, this story arc was inspired by the popular CBS-TV drama <i><a href="../../../t/o/u/Touched_By_An_Angel_e9b5.html" title="Touched By An Angel">Touched By An Angel</a></i>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Novacom saga</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Main article:</i> <b>Novacom saga</b></p>
<p>The largest continuous plot arc attempted to date, the "Novacom saga" spanned 29 episodes originally aired over a 20-month timeframe, and concerns the attempts of the Novacom Corporation to brainwash Odyssey and, eventually, the world.</p>
<p>The Novacom series begins with a number of episodes that introduce the Novacom corporation to Odyssey. Novacom is a media conglomerate, and buys a number of television and radio stations in the Odyssey area. Many of the television programming they run is controversial and violent, which quickly puts Whit and most of the protagonists of Odyssey at odds with Novacom. Later it is found that Novacom is trying to mind control the people of Odyssey and the world.</p>
<p>Over time, an increasing number of voices claim that Novacom is up to no good.</p>

<p>In addition to normal shows, which involve characters in the Odyssey fictional universe, a few other formats are frequently used (in, perhaps, 10% of episodes). These divergent formats are usually connected to Odyssey by such devices as inventions of John Avery Whittaker, for instance.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/v/Adventures_in_Odyssey_47fe.html" title="Edit section: KYDS Kids Radio">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">KYDS Kids Radio</span></h3>
<p><i>Kids Radio</i> is a <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_station.html" title="Radio station">radio station</a> run out of Whit's End. While it doesn't necessarily broadcast continually it has been used to tell many stories. A few of the broadcasted shows have included <i>The Twilife Zone</i> (a parody of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Twilight_Zone_97ab.html" title="The Twilight Zone">The Twilight Zone</a></i>), <i>The Jimmy Barclay Show</i>, <i>Candid Conversations with Connie</i>, "Ask Mitch", (later changed to "Ask Docter Wise") and <i>O.T. Action News</i>.</p>
<p>The idea behind KYDS "Kids Radio" began in episode #36: "Kids Radio". Brad Dillard, a local youth, convinces Whit to allow him to use some old equipment at "Whit's End" to produce a radio station for kids' programming. Though many of the children of Odyssey express interest, Brad cannot convince enough others to actually work on the production. Brad's father, seeing his son overworked, asks Whit to discontinue the station's operation, and he sadly does so.</p>
<p>However, Whit decided the idea was a good one, and in episodes #114: "The Big Broadcast", and #141: "Over the Airwaves," he reintroduces "Kids Radio" as a medium for conveying biblical truths to the children of Odyssey.</p>
<p>"Kids Radio" is an interesting plot device, as it plays into <i>AIO</i> in numerous, but very different, ways. For instance, several episodes of <i>AIO</i> are nothing more than a half-hour length "Kids Radio" program. Usually, the <i>AIO</i> episode begins as normal, after which a character (usually Connie Kendall) introduces the "Kids Radio" program to Odyssey residents. In this way, real listeners skip through the <a href="../../../o/d/y/Odyssey.html" title="Odyssey">Odyssey</a> fictional universe and enter a second-layer fictional universe, such as <i>The Twilife Zone</i>, a "Kids Radio" program. (For example, the <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pilot_episode.html" title="Pilot episode">pilot episode</a> for <i>The Twilife Zone</i> is the only content of episode #288: "The Twilife Zone.") Actress <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katie_Leigh_e091.html" title="Katie Leigh">Katie Leigh</a> portrays <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connie_Kendall_8bce.html" title="Connie Kendall">Connie Kendall</a>'s wrap-around of the broadcast of <i>The Twilife Zone,</i> as well as Rodlyn Serly, the host of <i>The Twilife Zone</i> who is fictional even in <a href="../../../o/d/y/Odyssey.html" title="Odyssey">Odyssey</a>. Thus, with these programs, there is a double-layer of fiction.</p>
<p>Other <i>AIO</i> episodes contain "Kids Radio" programs, but from the perspective of the <a href="../../../o/d/y/Odyssey.html" title="Odyssey">Odyssey</a> fictional universe. For example, episode #294: "Unto Us a Child is Born", concerns the playwriting, directing, recording, and live-radio drama on "Kids Radio" (live in the Odyssey fictional universe, not in reality). The same is the case with episodes of <i>Candid Conversations with Connie,</i> sports programs, and others.</p>
<p>It is implied that "Kids Radio" is not in continual live broadcast, as characters sometimes use the studio (located in <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whit%27s_End_3930.html" title="Whit's End">Whit's End</a>) to conduct private conversations, as in episodes #335 &amp; #336, "Love is on the Air, Parts 1 &amp; 2".</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/v/Adventures_in_Odyssey_47fe.html" title="Edit section: The Imagination Station">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Imagination Station</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="../../../i/m/a/Imagination_Station_c4e0.html" title="Imagination Station">Imagination Station</a> is undoubtedly the most often-used <a href="../../../p/l/o/Plot_device.html" title="Plot device">plot device</a>, outside of the major characters and "Whit's End"/Odyssey as a whole, in <i>AIO</i>. Indeed, it is almost a character itself, having evolved throughout the <i>AIO</i> storyline and playing a major role in most <i>AIO</i> plot arcs. The Imagination Station is one of John Avery Whittaker's inventions. People can use the station to experience historical and biblical events in a seemingly more-immersive version of <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virtual_reality.html" title="Virtual reality">virtual reality</a>. The general concept is similar in many respects to the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a> <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holodeck.html" title="Holodeck">holodeck</a>. The station is typically used for educational and for other productive reasons however on one occasion the fictional corporation Novacom attempted to exploit its technology to enslave the entire world. In the video series episode "A Knight for a Day" the Imagination Station is used by the villain as a mind-control device.</p>
<p><a name="The_Room_of_Consequence" id="The_Room_of_Consequence"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/v/Adventures_in_Odyssey_47fe.html" title="Edit section: The Room of Consequence">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Room of Consequence</span></h3>
<p>The "Room of Consequence", another of Whit's inventions, was introduced in episode #236, "Into Temptation". The idea is that just as the Imagination Station allows individuals to step into the past, the Room of Consequence allows them to see a possible future, usually extrapolated from the decisions the person is making in the present. Unlike the Imagination Station, the Room of Consequence does not appear to allow for significant interaction with the future environment.</p>
<p>The Room of Consequence plays a much smaller role in <i>AIO</i> than the Imagination Station, with only ten episodes including it to date.</p>
<p><a name="The_Transmuter" id="The_Transmuter"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/v/Adventures_in_Odyssey_47fe.html" title="Edit section: The Transmuter">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Transmuter</span></h3>
<p>The Transmuter is another one of John Avery Whittaker's inventions. Just as The Imagination Station allows a person to experience the past, and The Room of Consequence allows a person to see a possible future, the Transmuter allows a person to experience the present from another person's point of view. This lets you experience events from a perspective you normally wouldn't be able to see. It debuted in episode #419, "Another Man's Shoes". The Transmuter is described as bearing a resemblance to the <a href="../../../w/e/i/Weighing_scale.html" title="Weighing scale">weight scales</a> in a Doctor's office.</p>

<li>The names of the Barclay family are all based on the movie <i><a href="../../../i/t/27/It%27s_a_Wonderful_Life_54b1.html" title="It's a Wonderful Life">It's a Wonderful Life</a></i>: George is based on the character George Bailey, played by <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Stewart_33aa.html" title="Jimmy Stewart">Jimmy Stewart</a>, Mary is based on Mary Bailey, played by <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donna_Reed_6a7a.html" title="Donna Reed">Donna Reed</a>. While the adults' names are based on the fictional characters' names, their children's names, Donna, Jimmy and Stewart, are based on the names of the actors Donna Reed and Jimmy Stewart, respectively (Stewart's middle name is Reed, putting the actors' last names together). The last name is a close approximation of Bailey. The relation between <i>It's a Wonderful Life</i> and the Barclays on AIO is so close that they made a 1-hour Adventures in Odyssey episode (It's a Pokenberry Christmas, Parts I &amp; II) with the plotline and many of the quotes from the movie. Also AIO characters have alluded to <i>It's a Wonderful Life</i>. See <a href="http://aiohq.com/referenc.htm#wonderlife" class="external text" title="http://aiohq.com/referenc.htm#wonderlife" rel="nofollow">List of references to <i>It's A Wonderful Life</i></a>.</li>

<li>An <i>AIO</i> episode, #248, "Terror from the Skies", is based heavily on the radio broadcast <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_War_of_the_Worlds_%28radio%29_eb0e.html" title="The War of the Worlds (radio)">The War of the Worlds</a></i> by Orson Welles. The episode features Edwin Blackgaard, owner of the "Harlequin Dinner Theatre", producing a radio broadcast dubbed <i>Terror from the Skies</i>. Like <i>The War of the Worlds</i>, it uses news bulletins tell about an alien invasion. In Blackgaard's broadcast, a <a href="../../../m/e/t/Meteor.html" title="Meteor">meteor</a> lands near Odyssey. The meteor breaks open and several hideous <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extraterrestrial_life.html" title="Extraterrestrial life">aliens</a> emerge, who capture and eat several people, before encountering the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_National_Guard_9eaf.html" title="United States National Guard">National Guard</a>. The National Guard try to defeat them, but to no avail, as the aliens are not affected at all by the weapons. All appears to be lost, until the aliens succumb to the simplest weapon: water, which affects them in a way similar to acid. This is an homage to the way the aliens in <i>The War of the Worlds</i> succumb to viruses and bacteria. <i>Terror from the Skies</i> is confirmed by Edwin Blackgaard to be simply a dramatization, much like the way Orson Wells confirmed his to be.</li>

<li><i>AIO</i> Episodes #122 and #123 "Castles &amp; Cauldrons, Part 1" and "Castles &amp; Cauldrons, Part 2" were the first episodes to have a parental advisory from Focus on the Family founder/chairman <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Dobson_fefe.html" title="James Dobson">Dr. James Dobson</a> due to the heavily dramatic and spiritual nature of the episodes. The episodes portrayed spiritual aspects of <a href="../../../r/o/l/Role-playing_game.html" title="Role-playing game">fantasy role-playing games</a> (RPGs). The scripts were carefully reviewed by <i>AIO</i> and Focus on the Family staff members prior to airing. These episodes are highly controversial, even among Christians. Castles and Cauldrons is a reference to <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dungeons_and_Dragons_fd83.html" title="Dungeons and Dragons">Dungeons and Dragons</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>On the compilation album, <i>Grins, Grabbers and Great Getaways</i>, episode #36, "Kids Radio" was labelled "KYDS Radio" (apparently using KYDS as the station's call sign). This is a play on words as the station was run "by kids, for kids". The <i>AIO</i> website and later releases of the episode changed the name to "Kids' Radio". Although, most fans refer to it as "KYDS Radio".</li>
