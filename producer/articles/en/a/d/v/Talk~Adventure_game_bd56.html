<p>Japanese adventure games are NOT the equivalent of visual novels, or at least, not visual novels as described in the Wikipedia article. I own several (categorized as adventure on Amazon.co.jp and their maker websites) for the PS2, and they are not just walls of text, with static backgrounds and pictures. There are a couple like this, but not all, and in several, there are significant portions of gameplay that resemble an RPG or other type of game with several minigames, fighting, or different activities to perform. I know the terminology of this 'type' of game is already really mixed up, but I'd like to at least remove the reference to visual novels because it's misleading.Lijakaca 20:40, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's true that not all Japanese adventure games are visual novels. However, there are literally <i>hundreds</i> of visual novel games available. The "Adventure" section of most Japanese game stores, in my experience anyway, tends to include "action adventure" games along with games that fit the description on this page. I think that removing the reference to visual novels is a bad idea, as it is a prevalent form of this genre and is mostly restricted to Japan, but it would be fair to add a comment mentioning that Japan does not produce such games exclusively. --<a href="../../../w/a/k/User%7EWaka_4674.html" title="User:Waka">waka</a> 13:05, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

...the release of the Sony PlayStation marked the end of the adventure era;...
</pre>
<p>That sentence doesn't make much sense, as the article states itself consoles never had much todo with the development of adventures, most of the console adventures where just ports from C64, Amiga or PC. So the Playstation can't really have had very much influence into the dawnfall of the adventure genre, since they never had (many) adventure games to begin with. -- Grumbel 16:41, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I wrote that line, but I didn't intend to suggest that the PS1 caused the fall of the Adventure genre (though I think a case could be made that public interest in games made a major transition to the Adventure-light console systems). Rather, I meant that the decline of the Adventure era coincided with the release of the PS1. I didn't mean to indicate any causality here, so if you find the line confusing go ahead and change it. --<a href="../../../w/a/k/User%7EWaka_4674.html" title="User:Waka">waka</a> 20:02, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I've gone through and tidied up the language. I feel the clean-up tag could go now. Thoughts?</p>

<p>Games which would be labelled Action Adventure on the console are oftenly labelled Action RPG or just CRPG on the computer. Is there a difference between Action Adventures and Action RPGs? Action RPGs seem to be identical to Action Adventures, just that they have RPG-elements (usually that means character stats and skills). However most modern CRPGs are action focussed (the vast majority of skills are about combat, most quests involve combat as single or primary solution), so most of them could easily be called Action RPGs. Where is the border between CRPGs and ARPGs, where the border between Action Adventures and Action RPGs? -<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshmodai_1a4e.html" title="User:Ashmodai">Ashmodai</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>As I see it, action RPGs are basically any any RPG with pronounced action and reflex-based elements, the most notable example being <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diablo_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Diablo (computer game)">Diablo</a>. The difference between an action-adventure game and an action-RPG can be vague, but basically boils down to "can I improve my character's statistics and abilities?" If the answer is no, then the game in question can't really be called an RPG. Just because the characters in a game are engaged in some kind of action doesn't mean the game can be called an action game; "action game" implies a requirement for dexterity and reflexes on the player's part, whereas in a non-action game the requirement is shifted onto the player's character(s). After all, there's more violent action implied in a game of Risk than in any CRPG, but Risk is clearly a strategy game because the <i>player</i> isn't required to simulate the action, only the strategizing. YMMV. -<a href="../../../g/t/r/User%7EGtrmp_2ffc.html" title="User:Gtrmp">Sean</a> 01:06, 30 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So by your definition a turn based CRPG cannot be an Action RPG, no matter if it focusses on action or not? Some kind of border case might be Baldur's Gate, which is clearly understood as a traditional CRPG by most people, but relies on twitch-action in its combat parts, although strategies and tactics can be applied by pausing during a combat. So technically, Baldur's Gate is partially an Action RPG because it can be played like one, or what? I think the seperation you suggested, although it might sometimes be unperfect, makes sense. -<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshmodai_1a4e.html" title="User:Ashmodai">Ashmodai</a></p>

<dd>Baldur's Gate only has minimal "twitch action", and then only if you turn off the autopausing feature. Which is a decision not unlike giving all of your characters bows but none of them arrows. -<a href="../../../g/t/r/User%7EGtrmp_2ffc.html" title="User:Gtrmp">Sean Curtin</a> 06:13, 31 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I.e. the game is primarily a CRPG, but can be played like an ARPG by the <i>l33t</i>, aye? Thought so. I suppose I just prefer turn based combat over twitch-action-which-isn't-because-it's-got-a-pause-mode combat. Ah, well, tastes differ. Don't take any offense from my wording. -<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshmodai_1a4e.html" title="User:Ashmodai">Ashmodai</a></p>

<p>Common genres of TBGs, or Text-Based Games include:</p>
<p>- Interactive Fiction. Posessing a novelistic style, and primarily concerned with the literary sense of the work. Examples include Phototopia and Luminous Horizon.</p>
<p>- Dungeon. Typically these TBGs are combat and maze-based. Some are single player, some are online, such as multiplayer text-based games (MUDs) with a fantasy flavor. Examples include Three Kingdoms, BorderZone.</p>
<p>- Adventure. Marked by the original D&amp;D-style exploration games with a puzzle theme. Examples include HLA Adventure, Zork.</p>
<p>- Slideshow Fiction. These are usually a story combined with still images. Some see these games as a natural evolution into the graphical medium. Examples include Myst and Space Quest.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Interactive fiction is already in there, MUDs are not really adventure games (but they're included in the "see also" section), and Myst is not a text-based game at all.

<p>The Lucas Arts section mentioning Monkey Island and the screen cap of the game all give the impression that MI originally used a more advanced version of SCUMM and was originally in 256 colors. This is not the case, it was originally in 16 colors and used a more primitive version of the SCUMM system. It wasn't until its re-release using version 5 of SCUMM that is saw the graphics and interface upgraded nor was it the first game to use SCUMM 5, MI2 was. The Wikipedia entries for SCUMM and Monkey Island both have more current information. The bits giving credit to MI1 as being the first could be altered to show that MI2 was the first, but I don't have the resources to pull this off. Also, being a newbie to all this I don't with to mess with such a large wiki entry.</p>

<p>I hope you don't mind a few criticisms made in the spirit of honest desire to approve this:</p>
<p>1) I think the overlap with Interactive Fiction is important.</p>
<p>2) I don't know why Loom is in "others" -- it's not that different from other games -- the spells serve as an inventory. Myst for example has less inventory.</p>
<p>3) The section on Myst descends into hyperbole. While I found it immersive, I found Zork much more immersive.</p>
<p>4) The history section hops around with graphic adventures coming before infocom.</p>
<p>5) Both Scott Adams and Infocom had graphical adventures (the S.A.G.A. --- Scott Adams graphical adventures) and a few graphics games from infocom including shogun and a few others (the interactive fiction page will have some).</p>
<p>6) Alone in the Dark seems a notable omission from Action-Adventure.</p>
<p>7) The types system seems confused since it implies that an adventure could be text, graphics, puzzle or action -- which I'm sure isn't the intent.</p>

<p>A new paragraph has recently been added to 'Common features' which needs reviewing. It states "Many graphic adventure games depicted or make reference to subject matter that would otherwise been censored or taboo in a video or computer game.". What is being referred to, and is it the majority or minority of adventure games? It also states "Adventure games that relied heavily on humor (i.e. Discworld, Blazing Dragons, Adventures of Willy Bemish, The Secret of Monkey Island and Simon the Sorcerer) were often influenced by Monthy Python satire and comedy." I disagree with this too - I would contend that Monkey Island is Pythonesque, and this appears subjective anyway. British humour is not the same as Pythonesque, and at least 3 out of the 5 games named are British (with one written by a former Python, so of course it's Pythonesque). Can we decide on what we want this paragraph to contain before we edit for typo's and grammar? <a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurns_flipper_b88f.html" title="User:Burns flipper">Burns flipper</a> 14:29, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A merge or redirection would be pointless. The creation of a Slide-Show game category is even a stretch in itself. If anything, the games it refers to (mainly Myst) should be considered on of the first 1st person Adventures with QuickTime Capability. The fact that each venue was static should hvae no bearing on whether the game warrants a different category or not. Keep it Bare bones basics, I say. And to give an opinion, "Slide Show Games" is a ridiculous notion to begin with. To take it's meaning literally would be as if I were to create a game using Microsoft Power Point: The best I could do would be to create a "what's hidden in this picture game". Slideshow denotes static, and any adventure game is anything but.--JYHASH 02:37, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This has nothing to do with fluency. It's a well-established term in gaming journalism in several countries. There is no word that is related to quest in Bulgarian, Russian or other languages, for example, so it's convenient an unambiguous to refer to them as "куест" games. I suspect that when a term had to be invented for other languages, "adventure" was either not yet an established term in English-language gaming classification, or a translation or transcription of the word "adventure" was deemed too ambiguous. (Actualy I recall an article in a Bulgarian gaming magazine in the 90's on the history of adventure games where they say it was the latter. I think there were people who argued for "приключенска игра" too, and it was generally agreed "адвенчър" is the poorest choice.) It might be worth a mention in the English wikipedia as it is an English word.&#160;:) <a href="../../../k/r/u/User%7EKrum_Stanoev_86e1.html" title="User:Krum Stanoev">Krum Stanoev</a> 11:08, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If it is important what an adventure game is called in different countries, why not make a whole section devoted to what an adventure game is called in different languages and countries? I wouldn't probably do that myself, as I don't think it is relevant information, but just listing a few countries seems unfair to me.&#160;;-) And I don't think it is important enough information to be mentioned in the first paragraph...--<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeadworm222_2d91.html" title="User:Deadworm222">Wormsie</a> 20:32, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There should be a mention of this kids' adventure game by Playmobil Interactive. For it was the very first video game to be designed specially for girls (though many boys played it, too), for before it, video games, although played by girls, were really marketed towards boys. 67.174.4.138 22:02, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would argue that Dreamfall is not an adventure game at all. If anything, it is an interactive movie. The puzzles are overly simplistic and there are several fighting-based action sequences. It is not a true sequel to The Longest Journey at all, but simply a game incorporating some of the same characters. I would argue that The Longest Journey should be classified as a stand-alone game. The definition in this article states that "[a]dventure is a genre of video game typified by exploration, puzzle-solving, interaction with game characters, and a focus on narrative rather than reflex-based challenges." Dreamfall incorporates no real puzzles and has too much of a focus on reflex-based challenges.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 63.230.51.130 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_63.230.51.130_cb32.html" title="Special:Contributions/63.230.51.130">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>I haven't played either of the games, but it sounds like you have a good argument. You can go ahead and make the change(s) yourself.

<p>no dont go ahead. "your argument" is meaningless in wikipedia - find a reliable 3rd party source that argues it and reference it.</p>
<p>p.s. you'll have to find more and better source than gamespot, which calls it an adventure game <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/pc/adventure/longestjourney2wt/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gamespot.com/pc/adventure/longestjourney2wt/index.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, adventuregamers, which calls it an adventure game <a href="http://www.adventuregamers.com/article/id,377" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.adventuregamers.com/article/id,377" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, itweek, which calls it an adventure game <a href="http://www.itweek.co.uk/personal-computer-world/software/2158924/dreamfall-longest-journey" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.itweek.co.uk/personal-computer-world/software/2158924/dreamfall-longest-journey" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, eurogamer, which calls it an adventure game <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=64432" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=64432" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, etc etc. get the picture?Nespresso 22:22, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Gamespot also classifies the following as adventure games: Barbie Fashion Show, Oregon Trail II, Survivor, and Leisure Suit Larry: Magna Cum Laude</p>
<p>Adventuregamers states in their review: "Dreamfall is a game that simply doesn't have much actual gameplay. Of the fifteen or so hours you'll spend playing, the vast majority of that time will consist solely of moving your character from place to place, person to person, and task to task, without any real challenge or even much of an interactive role." <a href="http://www.adventuregamers.com/article/id,626/p,2" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.adventuregamers.com/article/id,626/p,2" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></p>
<p>From the itweek review: "By and large this works reasonably well, but it also includes rudimentary combat and stealth systems, neither of which are particularly well executed or, indeed, fun. The biggest letdown is that the puzzling aspect has been greatly simplified, often reduced to little more than collecting a few items in order to progress." <a href="http://www.itweek.co.uk/personal-computer-world/software/2158924/dreamfall-longest-journey" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.itweek.co.uk/personal-computer-world/software/2158924/dreamfall-longest-journey" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></p>
<p>While lots of sites have no trouble classifying it as an adventure game, most of them also include reviews that show that it does not meet the definition, any more that the latest King's Quest game, the latest Leisure Suit Larry game, or the latest Broken Sword game do.</p>

<p>I think it should be mentioned somewhere that most traditional adventure games made today are made outside of North America, where they are still popular. In Europe for example, there wasn't a "huge crash" like what happened in the USA. ChocolateCookie01 14:52, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
