<p>Why exactly was moo removed? Whoever wrote apt-get thought it noteworthy enough to be mentioned when it's run without arguments. ("This APT has Super Cow Powers.") --Calamari 01:54, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I did, and I just removed it again. I realize that apt-get is indeed not very serious, but this doesn't change the fact that this is an encyclopedia, and that the article is about APT, not apt-get.--<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChealer_e61a.html" title="User:Chealer">Chealer</a> 22:39, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>apt-get redirects to this article, and if no separate article is created about apt-get, it should also include bits about apt-get. I suggest a header "Super Cow Powers", which explains the prominent mention of "This APT has Super Cow Powers." in apt-get, and the easter egg that it is.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>For example:
<dl>
<dd>== Super Cow Powers ==</dd>
<dd>The command line tool, apt-get, displays a message "This APT has Super Cow Powers." in its help message. This message is a hint of an <a href="../../../e/a/s/Easter_egg_%28media%29.html" title="Easter egg (media)">easter egg</a>. The easter egg in apt-get is, that when typing "apt-get moo", it displays an <a href="../../../a/s/c/ASCII_art_8901.html" title="ASCII art">ASCII art</a> image of a <a href="../../../c/o/w/Cow.html" title="Cow">cow</a>, and the text "Have you mooed today?".</dd>

<p>What about adding a whole section on Easter eggs, or the humor in apt-get? Since there isn't a separate article on apt-get the notable items in apt-get should be mentioned here. moo and supoer cow powers are noteworthy.

<dd>If you use "use" as a synonym, of "usage", then you should use "usage", which is less ambiguous.

<dd>Fine, I'll change it to "usage". And the whole thing is about how the program is used, so the onus is on you to provide reasons not to move the sections about. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThumperward_1d10.html" title="User:Thumperward">Chris Cunningham</a> 20:05, 14 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>I don't think a link to <a href="../../../a/p/t/Apt-rpm.html" title="Apt-rpm">apt-rpm</a> is appropriate in the See Also section. There is already a link in the body text, and the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_Layout_8552.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to Layout">Wikipedia:Guide to Layout</a> states that there is consensus that the "See also" section "should ideally not repeat links already present in the article."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Guide_to_Layout#See_also" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Guide_to_Layout#See_also" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Therefore, there needs to be a rationale for why this link <i>should</i> be included there, given that doing so goes outside of the guideline.

<p><a href="../../../d/a/t/WP%7EDATE_3c44.html" title="WP:DATE">WP:DATE</a> instructs that both <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>-<a href="../../../m/a/r/March_9.html" title="March 9">03-09</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_09.html" title="March 09">March 09</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a> are acceptable formats. In cases where multiple styles are correct and there is no compelling reason for one or the other, WP generally teaches to use whatever the original author used and to remain consistent throughout a given page. This page originally had the Month DD, YYYY format. There has been no compelling (or indeed <i>any</i>?) reason given for the change. Therefore, that is the format we should have here. <a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDMacks_c1d8.html" title="User:DMacks">DMacks</a> 13:13, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>See that "February 17, 1958" example? We could therefore presume that it is an acceptible format. We could edit-war for personal preferences about which format is "better" forever and never settle it, because there is no right answer, and all the choices are valid. Therefore, WP teaches us to use whatever the original author used. Therefore, "March 09, 1999" is how it should be.</dd>
<dd>While we're nailing this coffin shut, I even found an explicit policy on <a href="../../../d/a/t/WP%7EDATE_3c44.html#ISO_date_formats" title="WP:DATE">ISO date formats</a>, namely that they should not be used in general. I'll quote here so you don't have to go searching for it:
<dl>
<dd>dates, for example 1958-02-17, are unambiguous. However, they are not common in English prose, and are therefore unfamiliar to many readers. Accordingly, they should generally not be used in normal prose. This applies even if they are in a link</dd>

<dd>There are no WP guidelines that state that ISO isn't to be used. Please, rather than blaming other people for their possibly imperfect work, improve it yourself.

<p>Removing the first header makes the intro too long. The Sources section does not belong above the sample usage, because the concept of sources is not as important as the basic mechanism by which APT works.

<dd><b>Weakly opposed</b>. It looks like it's mostly a manual for apt-get and other command-line tools that come with apt, so maybe it would be better to include it as a footnote when discussing the front ends? OTOH, the doc mixes many topics (general apt configs, the apt-get command, other apt commands like dselect), so it might be better to omit this link and instead (if anything) have links to specific components of that (or another) doc in the relevant sections of the article. Or scrap it altogether...I don't think wiki pages generally link to external documentation about how to use their subject (instead link to a primary site for the subject overall, which would include links to docs). <a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDMacks_c1d8.html" title="User:DMacks">DMacks</a> 19:59, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><s>There's no requirement that a wikipage have an extlink to a website.

<dd>Indeed, but I don't see your point.

<dd>Seconded. It's basically a prescriptive link. If it were an actual man page I could see the point in it staying, but it doesn't describe what APT actually is so much as instruct one how to use it. It doesn't fit under any of the criteria for a site which should be listed under WP:EL. Including it invites further prescriptive edits to the extlinks. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThumperward_1d10.html" title="User:Thumperward">Chris Cunningham</a> 23:06, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Weak keep</b>. That HOWTO covers Debian package management quite a bit. I agree that the topic is broader than APT and that there is very little non-HOWTO content, but in the absence of an article which covers Debian package management in general, the link is still relevent. Now that we know there are as many people asking to remove the link as there are people for keeping it, the moderator can be assured that I won't object to any decision that can be made. I care very little.--<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChealer_e61a.html" title="User:Chealer">Chealer</a> 17:38, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Seems even further off-topic to me...it's a list of packages that are available via apt from some particular server for one particular OS platform. A bit like an article about telephones, or at best telephone-numbers in general, linking to the New York City telephone book. <a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDMacks_c1d8.html" title="User:DMacks">DMacks</a> 21:16, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>That link is even less relevant, as DMacks says. BTW, it was introduced by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Advanced_Packaging_Tool&amp;diff=66518763&amp;oldid=66104344" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Advanced_Packaging_Tool&amp;diff=66518763&amp;oldid=66104344" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> but I removed it since.
