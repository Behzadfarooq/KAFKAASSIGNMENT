<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/v/Adversarial_system.html" title="Edit section: History of the adversarial process">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History of the adversarial process</span></h2>
<p>Some writers trace the process to the medieval mode of <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trial_by_combat.html" title="Trial by combat">trial by combat</a>, in which some litigants, notably women, were allowed a champion to represent them. Certainly the use of the <a href="../../../j/u/r/Jury.html" title="Jury">jury</a> in the common law system seems to have fostered the adversarial system, and there are many today who believe that it remains the best way of providing for the determination of a disputed issue. On the other hand, the new British Civil Justice reforms initiated by Lord Woolf (the Civil Procedure Rules or CPR) are prefaced with a case management system controlled by the judge rather than by the lawyers representing the different parties; similar case management systems are coming into use in the United States.</p>
<p>The adversarial system also disposes of the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canard.html" title="Canard">canard</a> whereby lawyers are often asked how they can represent someone if they believe that person to be guilty (or innocent for that matter, although this might be a more difficult position): counsel must not deceive the court but his client is entitled to have the best presentation of the case laid before the tribunal and to have the evidence fully tested.</p>
<p><a name="Basic_features_of_the_adversarial_system" id="Basic_features_of_the_adversarial_system"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/v/Adversarial_system.html" title="Edit section: Basic features of the adversarial system">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Basic features of the adversarial system</span></h2>
<p>As an accused is not compelled to give evidence in a <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crime.html" title="Crime">criminal</a> adversarial proceeding, he may not be questioned by prosecutor or judge unless he chooses to do so. However, should he decide to testify, he is subject to <a href="../../../c/r/o/Cross-examination.html" title="Cross-examination">cross-examination</a> and can be found guilty of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perjury.html" title="Perjury">perjury</a>. As the election to maintain an accused person's 'right to silence' prevents any examination or cross-examination of that person's position, it follows that the decision of counsel as to what evidence will be called is a crucial tactic in any case in the adversarial system and hence it might be said that it is a lawyer's manipulation of the truth. Certainly, it requires the skills of counsel on both sides to be fairly equally pitted and subjected to an impartial judge.</p>
<p>By contrast, while defendants in most civil law systems can be compelled to give a statement, this statement is not subject to cross-examination and not given under oath. This allows the defendant to explain his side of the case without being subject to cross-examination by a skilled opposition.</p>
<p>Judges in an adversarial system tend to be more interested in ensuring the fair play of <a href="../../../d/u/e/Due_process.html" title="Due process">due process</a>, or <a href="../../../f/u/n/Fundamental_justice.html" title="Fundamental justice">fundamental justice</a>. Such judges decide, often when called upon by counsel rather than of their own motion, what <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evidence_%28law%29.html" title="Evidence (law)">evidence</a> is to be admitted when there is a dispute; though in some common law jurisdictions judges play more of a role in deciding what evidence to admit into the record or reject. At worst, abusing <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judicial_discretion.html" title="Judicial discretion">judicial discretion</a> would actually pave the way to a biased decision rendering obsolete the judicial process in question — <a href="../../../r/u/l/Rule_of_law.html" title="Rule of law">rule of law</a> being illicitly subordinated by rule of man under such discriminating circumstances.</p>
<p>The rules of evidence are also developed based upon the system of objections of adversaries and on what basis it may tend to prejudice the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trier_of_fact.html" title="Trier of fact">trier of fact</a> which may be the judge or the jury. In a way the rules of evidence can function to give a judge limited inquisitorial powers as the judge may exclude evidence he/she believes is not trustworthy or irrelevant to the legal issue at hand.</p>
<p>Peter Murphy in his Practical Guide to Evidence recounts an instructive example. A frustrated judge in an English (adversarial) court finally asked a barrister after witnesses had produced conflicting accounts, 'Am I never to hear the truth?' 'No, my lord, merely the evidence', replied counsel.</p>
<p>The name adversary system may be misleading in that it implies it is only within this type of system in which there are opposing prosecution and defense. This is not the case, and both modern adversary and inquisitiorial systems have the powers of the state separated between a prosecutor and the judge and allow the defendant the right to counsel. Indeed, the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights_4a1c.html" title="European Convention on Human Rights">European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms</a> in Article 6 requires these features in the legal systems of its signatory states.</p>
<p>The right to counsel in criminal trials was initially not accepted in some adversarial systems. It was believed that the facts should speak for themselves, and that lawyers would just blur the matters. As a consequence, it was only in <a href="../../../1/8/3/1836.html" title="1836">1836</a> that England allowed suspects of felonies to have legal counsel (the <i>Prisoners' Counsel Act</i>). In the United States, however, personally retained counsel have had a right to appear in all federal criminal cases since the adoption of the Constitution (a response to the English practice of barring counsel from felony cases) and in state cases at least since the end of the Civil War, although nearly all provided this right in their state constitutions or laws much earlier. Appointment of counsel for indigent defendants was nearly universal in federal felony cases, though it varied considerably in state cases <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt6frag7_user.html#amdt6_hd36" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt6frag7_user.html#amdt6_hd36" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. It was not until <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a> that the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Supreme_Court_2553.html" title="U.S. Supreme Court">U.S. Supreme Court</a> declared that legal counsel must be provided at the expense of the state for indigent felony defendants, under the federal Sixth Amendment, in state courts. See <i><a href="../../../g/i/d/Gideon_v._Wainwright_bcee.html" title="Gideon v. Wainwright">Gideon v. Wainwright</a></i>, <span class="plainlinksneverexpand"><a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=372&amp;page=335" class="external text" title="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=372&amp;page=335" rel="nofollow">372 U.S. 335</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>One of the most significant differences between the adversary system and the inquisitional system occurs when a criminal defendant admits to the crime. In an adversary system, there is no more controversy and the case proceeds to sentencing; though in many jurisdictions the defendant must have <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allocute.html" title="Allocute">allocution</a> of her or his crime, a false confession will not be accepted even in common law courts. By contrast, in an inquisitional system, the fact that the defendant has confessed is merely one more fact that is entered into evidence, and a confession by the defendant does not remove the requirement that the prosecution present a full case. This allows for <a href="../../../p/l/e/Plea_bargain.html" title="Plea bargain">plea bargaining</a> in adversary systems in a way that is difficult or impossible in inquisitional system, and many felony cases in the United States are handled without trial through such plea bargains.</p>
<p>Another difference is in the rules of evidence. Because the adversarial system assumes that the evidence is to be presented to laymen rather than to jurists, the rules of evidence are considerably more strict. Rules on <a href="../../../h/e/a/Hearsay.html" title="Hearsay">hearsay</a> are much stricter in most adversarial systems than in inquisitorial systems; though often lower tribunals are allowed some flexibility in applying the strict rules of common law evidence such as in domestic relations courts or in small claims proceedings where the parties are often unrepresented by lawyers and the judge functions as more of an inquisitor to protect the interests of children than a neutral arbiter of justice.</p>
<p>In some adversarial legislative systems, the court is permitted to make inferences on an accused's failure to face <a href="../../../c/r/o/Cross-examination.html" title="Cross-examination">cross-examination</a> or to answer a particular question. This obviously limits the usefulness of silence as a tactic by the defence. In England the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 allowed such inferences to be made for the first time in England and Wales.(It was already possible in Scotland under the rule of criminative circumstances) This change was disparaged by critics as an end to the 'right to silence', though in fact an accused still has the right to remain silent and cannot be compelled to take the stand. In the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, the <a href="../../../f/i/f/Fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution_1b56.html" title="Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Fifth Amendment</a> has been interpreted to prohibit a jury from drawing a negative inference based on the defendant's invocation of his right not to testify, and the jury must be so instructed if the defendant requests.</p>
<p><a name="Comparisons_with_the_inquisitorial_approach" id="Comparisons_with_the_inquisitorial_approach"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/v/Adversarial_system.html" title="Edit section: Comparisons with the inquisitorial approach">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Comparisons with the inquisitorial approach</span></h2>
<p>In many jurisdictions the approaches of each system are often formal differences in the way cases are reviewed. It is questionable that the results would be different if cases were conducted under the differing approaches; in fact no statistics exist that can show that these systems do not come to the same result. However, these approaches are often a matter of national pride and there are opinions amongst jurists about the merits of the differing approaches and their drawbacks as well.</p>
<p>Proponents of the adversarial system often argue that the system is more fair and less prone to abuse than the inquisitional approach, because it allows less room for the state to be biased against the defendant. It also allows most private litigants to settle their disputes in an amicable manner through discovery and pre-trial settlements in which non-contested facts are agreed upon and not dealt with during the trial process.</p>
<p>In addition, adversarial procedure defenders argue that the inquisitorial court systems are overly institutionalized and removed from the average citizen. The common law trial lawyer has ample opportunity to uncover the truth in a laboratory called the courtroom. Most cases that go to trial are carefully prepared through a discovery process that aids in the review of evidence and testimony before it is presented to judge or jury. The lawyers involved have a very good idea of the scope of agreement and disagreement of the issues to present at trial which develops much in the same way as the role of investigative judges. It has also been argued that a trial by a jury of one's peers may be more impartial than any government paid inquisitor and a panel of his peers. In the United States the right to a trial by a jury of one's peers who are common citizens is guaranteed by the United States Constitution.</p>
<p>Proponents of inquisitorial justice dispute these points. They point out that most cases in adversarial systems are actually resolved by <a href="../../../p/l/e/Plea_bargain.html" title="Plea bargain">plea bargain</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/t/Settlement_%28law%29.html" title="Settlement (law)">settlement</a>. Most legal cases in these systems do not go to trial; this can lead to great injustice when the defendant has an unskilled or overworked attorney, which is likely to be the case when the defendant is poor. In addition, proponents of inquisitorial systems argue that the plea bargain system causes the participants within the system to act in perverse ways, in that it encourages prosecutors to bring charges far in excess of what is warranted and defendants to plead guilty even when they believe that they are not. Furthermore, proponents of inquisitorial systems also argue that the power of the judge is limited by the use of lay assessors and that a panel of judges may not necessarily be more biased than a jury.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some countries with an <a href="../../../i/n/q/Inquisitorial_system.html" title="Inquisitorial system">inquisitorial system</a> do use <a href="../../../j/u/r/Jury_trial.html" title="Jury trial">jury trials</a> for some categories of <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crime.html" title="Crime">crime</a>. Interestingly, some countries such as <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a> before 1943 which used to have a right to jury trial, rarely used them, as there is a popular belief that any defendant who requests a jury trial has a case that is so weak that they are willing to risk pleading their case before strangers rather than professional judges. Hence, jurors in those countries are very unsympathetic toward defendants. (Jury system in Japan was suspended in 1943. In 2004, whole new lay-judge system was enacted in Japan and will be installed in 2009. In this system, 6 jurors and 3 judges will discuss and judge a case together.)</p>
<p><a name="Criticisms_of_the_adversarial_system" id="Criticisms_of_the_adversarial_system"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/v/Adversarial_system.html" title="Edit section: Criticisms of the adversarial system">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Criticisms of the adversarial system</span></h2>
<p>Critics of this system suggest that the ability of a party to obtain a favorable result may hinge more upon the quality of their lawyers than on the facts of the case. An uncharismatic lawyer may fail to sway the jury with the plain facts of the case, whereas a highly charismatic lawyer may find favor with the jury by relating a narrative that seems to have little to do with the facts. This perception has been highlighted in popular culture - a classic example being the <i><a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Park_326f.html" title="South Park">South Park</a></i> episode in which <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnnie_Cochran_a847.html" title="Johnnie Cochran">Johnnie Cochran</a> is portrayed as winning the jury over with his absurd and meaningless <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chewbacca_defense.html" title="Chewbacca defense">Chewbacca defense</a>.</p>
<p>The system is also criticized for the lucrative advantages it appears to present to the lawyer. Although both civil and criminal defendants are generally permitted to represent themselves <i>pro se</i>, the complexity of the legal system means that the civil defendant is often forced to either pay whatever it takes to defend himself, or enter into a settlement with the opposing party. This is typified in <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danny_Devito_306b.html" title="Danny Devito">Danny Devito</a>'s famous quote in <i><a href="../../../o/t/h/Other_People%27s_Money_fd95.html" title="Other People's Money">Other People's Money</a></i> that "lawyers are like nuclear weapons, you have yours, I have mine, and when we use them they %^%$ everything up".</p>
<p>The system has also been attacked as an obsolete relic of ancient customs like the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trial_by_ordeal.html" title="Trial by ordeal">trial by ordeal</a> and <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divine_law.html" title="Divine law">divine law</a>.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The adversarial system has also been attacked for failing to accurately resolve complex high-tech science and technology issues by technically-unqualified judges and juries, and this has lead to proposals for a science-based legal system. In the proposed science-based system, all experts retained for matters of science and technology would be required to be totally neutral (retained by the courts instead of by opposing parties). Such a system has been proposed by many people in the criminal-justice system and engineering and scientific communities to eliminate hired guns and their junk science and slanted testimony and keep scientific fraud out of the courts. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
