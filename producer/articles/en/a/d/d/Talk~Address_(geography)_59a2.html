<dd>I disagree with removing this text from the article (and I shall put it back). The aim of contributions to Wikipedia is to improve on articles, not remove pieces of text just because they are not liked. Moving it to another article is good. Editing it to remove the NPOV appearance is good. Not good is to delete without any positive contributions.--jrleighton 01:54, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I tracked down the origin of this section. It was originally the "Revision as of 03:41, 3 August 2005", and was written by "219.78.20.85", who wrote that a Briton would have written it as "Birmingham, UK" or "Birmingham in England", and not as "Birmingham, England". Given that he identifies himself there as "an indian citizen living in hong kong", I'm going to delete these references from the article. But his point that Americans have an improper propensity to assume that the wouldwide audience will understand the state abbreviations, I'll leave that part in. --Keeves 21:18, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Note the redirect from "Postal Address" to "Address (geography)". While the common use of the term "address" assumes some "geographic" name(s) / identification (involving some or all of street number, street name, apartment or suite, sub-division or "urbanization", city/locality, state, country, etc.), that is often not the case. That is, it would be more accurate to acknowledge the bipartite nature of "Address (postal and/or geography)". Indeed, if one wants to be even more precise and inclusive, that would need to be "Address (delivery routing information and/or geography)" - read further down for why. Not "postal" because there are non-postal "addresses". Non- postal addresses can either be so because of a lack of precise data (many countries lack that data in an open, consistent, and public form ... though a recipient or a community may "name" their location, which others may or may not use and with which those others may or may not agree!). Address may also be non-postal because some "real" locations (residences or businesses) do not have a postal address (by fiat or by design). Indeed, based on the Wikipedia entry for "geography" and some comments there (specifically those by William Hughes), one might consider replacing "geography" with [human] "named locations".</p>
<p>The domain of address as associated with a geographic name or location does not always uniquely and precisely cover the domain of "Postal Address". Why? Relevant address examples where geography and address representation do not merge and match (the geography is at least "opaque" from if not different from the "Postal Address" and/or actual delivery location) include Post Office Boxes (POB), Rural Route / Highway Contract (RR/HC), General Delivery (GD), Unique ZIP codes (used at least in the USA), military style addresses (used in USA, Canada, and elsewhere), and lately business complex or subdivision wide delivery boxes (to optimize their delivery operations, USPS is pushing both old and new business complexes and especially "gated" subdivisions to adopt "on site", consolidated / single location boxes).</p>
<p>For the last of the above examples, physical delivery location for suites or addresses is not directly / geographically at (each of) those addresses. Rather it is associated with a set of delivery boxes somewhere else. To be sure, that "somewhere else" may be in a building lobby or at a "front gate entrance" near those addresses; but, the address representation for delivery may either be by "box at general address" or use the geographic address (though the delivery is actually done to a box known to be the delivery location associated with that geographic address ... but again not at that geographic address itself). This is similar to a row of RR/HC mailboxes on a "main road" somewhat near to, though occasionally miles away from, the geographic locations (addresses) of the recipients. Note that though USPS is in the process of attempting to convert RR/HC type address to street name type address (and has been for some time), there are still several million of those in the USA (and many more world-wide, where any such conversion process - if it happens at all - will take much longer!).</p>
<p>Such non-directly-geographic addresses may only be "addressed" via their postal authority designations and by operational delivery knowledge. Those designations are mainly comprised of postal authority constructed and maintained "routing information". Under such designations and operations, there are not necessarily enough externally exposed or commonly recognizable "geographic" names or components to specify an "address" (city and state may be included but those could hardly be considered precise enough to identify an "address"!). Rather, precise "geography" (for physical delivery and/or for its association with some "real" geographic name / location) is only known by the delivery agency. And, the delivery agency is not always a postal authority. Private delivery can and does occur either as contracted - Rural Route / Highway Contract (indirectly postal authority) or completely via a private delivery service (which can maintain their own geographic name or "virtual" delivery designations for an address).</p>
<p>See UPS "loop and segment" route designations (virtual addresses) by which deliveries can be made to both postal and non-postal addresses (docks at warehouses, in warehouse districts for example). That is just one example of a private delivery "address" designation. The "loop and segment" designation (though often but not always associated with a "real" commonly named location and/or postal address) can be unique and allows UPS to accomplish delivery to a geographic location. But, that loop and segment identification should not be confused with a common geographic representation (it is only a current routing representation, since routes can be changed).</p>
<p>A PO Box can be designated as a numbered physical box in some post office that serves a ZIP (postal) code, or (if mail delivery is large enough for a recipient - either in volume or size) may just be a "pseudo box" (bin in the back or just a sticker on a package in a general holding area). Both the ZIP code and the post office (physical location and/or delivery responsibility) are open to change. Moreover, a change in ZIP code or a reorganization of post offices (old ones closed, new ones opened) can (and does) result in a different geographical location being associated with the same (unchanged) PO Box with regard to its recipient / owner. One can quibble about whether an unchanged PO Box number at the same or a new post office location with the same or a new (different) ZIP code is a different address (for the same physical post office with the same POB under a new ZIP code, or for a new location post office with the same POB under that same or a new ZIP code).</p>
<p>The situation is even more geographically divorced (or opaque) with unique ZIP and military style addresses. A unique ZIP identified address is merely a "routing code" (needing basically only the 5 digit ZIP!) for a mail-room. The physical location of that mail-room is necessarily known only by the recipient (who sets it up) and the postal authority (who delivers to it). That mail room may be located at or near a commonly known geographic location / address OR may be "secured" behind a gate and on property for which there is no commonly known geographic name (street number and name). One might obtain by means other than the unique ZIP a geocode for such a location; but few so far would accept a geocode as a commonly known geography named "address" (even though by means of mapping and GPS technology it could be more geographically precise than an "address").</p>
<p>A military style address is a routing code or identification known only by a military post office, to which the "regular" postal authority tenders that mail. The routing code may not relate to any physical location at all but rather to an organization (military unit) that "moves around" (obviously the case for a maritime unit / ship, but also for others as well). So there will be no invariant / permanent geocode for many military "addresses".</p>
<p>To be sure, one would like to ASSUME that such "odd" constructs will someday be dispensed with (say maybe everyone learns their "address" as a geocode and everyone else agrees to use that!? ... notwithstanding any "moveable" addresses like those for some military units). The weight of human "place naming" and postal / delivery operations being what it is, that may be unlikely for a very long time to come. So until and unless that happens, "address" will probably have these "quirks" that should be acknowledged in any reference source on the subject.</p>

<p>in many countries you would format an address this way 111-4444 main st. the way you would interpret this address is the building number is 4444, and the apartment is 111. i was wondering if an american would interpret it the same way, or how else would he interpret it. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.142.82.222_d098.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.142.82.222">86.142.82.222</a> (<a href="../../../8/6/2E/User_talk%7E86.142.82.222.html" title="User talk:86.142.82.222">talk</a>) 03:10, 15 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>That format isn't followed here.

Your address would be written 4444 MAIN ST APT 111.
