It has no place in that article, arguably it could appear in an article about hoaxes, but even then it seems pretty non-notable with no significant material written about it beyond the odd paragraph blurb. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk"><font color="mediumseagreen">talk</font></a>)</sup> 16:35, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I not only gave an explanation for opposing Addhoc's change to the article, I posted fair warning on the article talk page that he would be blocked for perpetuating this hoax that I have dealt with on Wikipedia for over a year now. Given his assurance that he will not edit the affected article, I have unblocked him. This is not a content dispute—this is a case of knowingly adding content to Wikipedia that has been rejected as false and fradulent in the past. Once Addhoc shows that he is receptive to Wikipedia's community standards for handling such content this issue will be resolved. Other than his fixation on the Matrixism issue, Addhoc has been a fine contributor—I would characterize him as a net positive contributor to the project. It would serve the interests of the project for Addhoc to become more responsive to corrective actions in the future. — <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Philwelch</a> <a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">t</a> 23:36, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As far as Just War theory goes, I was merely trying to clarify what was already on the page. If I accidentally changed the meaning through my attempt at clarification it is only due to my limited expertise on the subject and should of course be changed to align correctly with how Just War theory really is defined.</p>
<p>On the other point, I wasn't attempting to show a case for "human rights" from agency, except insofar as one thinks that human rights and moral rights (ie, moral protection) are interchangable terms. Using human agency (roughly defined as rationality and free will) as a fundamental premise for morality and moral protection is a mark of <a href="../../../d/e/o/Deontological_ethics.html" title="Deontological ethics">deontological ethics</a>, the ethical category to which absolutism belongs. Deontological ethics is the main competitor to utilitarianism in moral philosophy. So I guess I'm not exactly sure what you're getting at; perhaps I simply was unclear and have confused you, in which case you are welcome to clean up my comments for clarity.</p>

<p>Looing at those, they are both quoting a single source and in my view certainly don't provide any level of verifiability, as even that single source only quotes the matrixism source website as claiming a following. It is so vague as to be meaningless, I doubt very much meets our notibility requirements nor our NPOV or reliable source requirements. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk"><font color="mediumseagreen">talk</font></a>)</sup> 16:54, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

Just before replying, I gave a welcome message, which is customary, as you can see on my page, VSmith left a similar message.

<p>Addhoc , thank you for your well-meaning efforts at that article. Although I disagree on technical grounds with many of your changes, it may be good to you to get involved with the article and learn about it, so I will postpone my comments and refrain from reverting you for now.</p>
<p>If you are truly committed to spend the countless hours defending WP's NPOV against an admitted advocate of BDORT, who sells it for a living, despite the procedure (and related techniques) being declared '...irresponsible and unacceptable' by a Medical Disciplinary Review Board in NZ, please carry on.</p>
<p>Be aware however, that the advocates, of which we have seen several, will persist until the article will look their way. When they are done, it will say that BDORT is a wonderful technique, that can diagnose and heal most diseases, from the common cold to cancer, and has simply not been appreciated by mainstream medicine. Be also aware that there are people out there, potential WP readers, who will rely on BDORT to the exclusion of conventional diagnoses and treatments, as was the case in NZ, with possible dire consequences.</p>
<p>It is clearly not WP's role to perform any <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, and we must only present <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. But under persistent daily barrage and pressure of the BDORT advocates, the article can gradually erode, as well meaning editors, such as yourself, may not have the same willingness to devote the needed hours per day, every day, to it to defend against the professional advocates, who will persist indefinitely, as their livelihoods clearly depend on it.</p>
<p>Again, I will let you try this out for a while to get the feel of the situation and decide if you wish in fact to commit the needed long term resources to it. Thanks, <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 11:29, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Crum375, you repeat your misrepresentation of me again, even though I have explained this to you before. This is not so good. Again for the record here: I do not advertise, attract, "sell", or otherwise promote for monetary profit or reputation the BDORT to attract patients to come to consult with me, or any other activity that would lead to my financial gain. I practise Japanese-style acupuncture. As a technical tool within my consultations I sometimes use the BDORT. The patients do not know it by that name, mostly do not know what I am doing, etc. If that is not clear enough for you let me know. Otherwise you are repeating the mistake I highlighted to you on the Omura Talk page. I anticipate that you might say my website is some kind of promotion. You would be right. It is technically promoting my techniques to other practitioners as a non-financial friendly sharing of information with colleagues. I hope that corrects your misunderstanding. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardmalter_f65b.html" title="User:Richardmalter">Richardmalter</a> 04:58, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You are you making false accusations. The evidence you have presented to suggest that I am into puppets is a joke. You are just upset you can't seem to force your POV. Believe me there are enough people who believe the article intro is flawed. My advice to you is to learn to better *articulate* your points rather than descending into mudslinging. Please take this as an honest advice. Learn to convince other people in good faith than trying to create animosity. Trincomanb 02:08, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You are being warned for the second time for appearing to be uncivil and harassing other users who don't share your POV. You have repeatedly issued warning templates on user talk pages, with the sole purpose of intimidating them and without any form of evidence. There appears to be circumstantial evidence that appear to show you have left some threatening comments on my talk page directed to me and my family (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Trincomanb&amp;oldid=70316915" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Trincomanb&amp;oldid=70316915" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Trincomanb&amp;oldid=70316915</a>) and covered that up by making a comment try to distance yourself from it. You have appeared to have done this anonymously to prevent getting caught. Online harrasment is a crime in many countries and continued attempts to do this will result in a complaint made to Wikipedia adminstrators and the relevant police authorities. It would be prudent for you to read the wikipedia Harassment policy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Harassment" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Harassment" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Harassment</a> It is important to keep a cool head, especially when responding to comments against you or your edits. <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Personal attacks</a> and <a href="../../../d/o/n/Wikipedia%7EDon%27t_disrupt_Wikipedia_to_illustrate_a_point_8268.html" title="Wikipedia:Don't disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point">disruptive comments</a> only escalate a situation; please keep calm and remember that action can be taken against other parties if necessary.

<p>That applies to other editors more than me. I am merely correcting errors in the article. Wikipedia is based on <b>FACTS</b> and not POV's. When a user deliberately reverts an article in favor of his or her POV that is a vandal. And I’m not doing that. Unfortunately, users on LTTE page acts like 7 year olds - showing disrespect to every other user except for what they want to add. The intro. was discussed in the talk page before and everyone had to compromise in some way to reach an agreed intro. At that time these user did not contribute in anyway and now keep changing to their POV. This is clearly showing disrespect to other users and <b>disrespecting Wikipedia policies</b>. Keep in mind that wikipedia is based on <b>Facts</b> and you can change the article any amount of times if that is to genuinely maintain quality and NPOV(FACTS)of the article!----RavenS 00:03, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, when a user reverts an article because of their peception of NPOV, this is a good faith edit in a content dispute, which certainly isn't vandalism. You have said the LTTE are terrorists should be described as such, this is clearly against the advice of <a href="../../../w/t/a/WP%7EWTA_2564.html#Terrorist.2C_terrorism" title="WP:WTA">WP:WTA:terrorism</a>. However, I agree that some users are acting in a manner that is slightly immature. Finally, I would advise you are not correct in your last statement: you cannot make more than three good faith reverts in twenty-four hours. <a href="../../../a/d/d/User%7EAddhoc_21d7.html" title="User:Addhoc">Addhoc</a> 10:15, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
