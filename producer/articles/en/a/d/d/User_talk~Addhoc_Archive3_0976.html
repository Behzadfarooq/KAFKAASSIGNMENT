<dd>I'm taking a short Wikibreak. Therefore I am not going to participate in this mediation anymore.

<p>Hello Addhoc,</p>
<p>I'm pretty much playing it by ear. I closed the advocacy case following Messhermit's statement above, but am willing to engage as a mediator or as an instigator at large;-)--<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_6b89.html" title="User:Amerique">Amerique</a> 12:55, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks, I guess I should have looked to see whether Messhermit's case was closed. Would you be interested in leading this mediation? <a href="../../../a/d/d/User%7EAddhoc_21d7.html" title="User:Addhoc">Addhoc</a> 12:57, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, it seems to me that there is an interestingly diplomatic exchange occuring on the article talk page, which Tony Sidaway has been participating in. I don't think the situation calls for more overt leadership at this point, but i would like to help facilitate the discussion. I'm not sure how to proceed with the MEDCAB case. The article itself could use someone's leadership in finding references, however.--<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_6b89.html" title="User:Amerique">Amerique</a> 13:22, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can't you contribute to the evidence page?

<dd>Hi Mammal4, Cornwall has previously had independence, the other entities listed, Wales, England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Isle of Man and United Kingdom all similarly have previously been or currently are independent. Sussex by comparison hasn't been considered independent since the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norman_invasion.html" title="Norman invasion">Norman invasion</a>. <a href="../../../a/d/d/User%7EAddhoc_21d7.html" title="User:Addhoc">Addhoc</a> 09:41, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thats fine - I don't really have a problem with that - probably best to leave you're reasons on the discusssion page though in case someone comes back and changes it again. You might want to look at the organisation of the England portal too, which lists Cornwall as a subportal of England, and Sussex as a related portal along with Scotland etc which I think is a bit mixed up. take care <a href="../../../m/a/m/User%7EMammal4_a688.html" title="User:Mammal4">Mammal4</a> 12:02, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Addhoc--Thanks for the edit to the Fred Newman entry. Unfortunately, the changes you made were reverted by a contributor who has consistently inserted misinformation, false information, and a fair amount of material, generally unsourced, which straddles the line of libelous. For the past week or so, I've been cleaing up the article, and supplying backing citations. The other author [journalist Dennis King, posting anonymously] has relented in each instance, as the corrections were valid (see Discussion section of the article for a history). However, on one section, Mr. King insists on reverting his formulation, to wit: "It's [the Newman founded youth program All Stars Project] board and staff are dominated by followers and therapy patients of Newman, some of whom live with Newman and Kurlander in a communal townhouse in Manhattan." It has repeatedly been pointed out to Mr. King that this disclosure of personal therapeutic choice has no place in an encyclopedia (not to mention whether or not the statement is true, i.e., is it communal, do such persons live there etc)&gt; his justification that the information has been "widely reported" is disingenuous; it is not widely reported, and the citations he adds are either to his own website or to material for which he was the primary source. Arguing with this gentleman has reached a point of absurdity--your assistance, or any direction on how to proceed, is greatly apprecaited. I have attempted to delete the offending line with a note added that it has been refrred to mediation, but the reversions persist.

<p>Similar situation as with Newman article above. Same person, Dennis King, reverting back to his highly non NPOV version, and basically making the article a forum for his somewhat defamatory and getting a bit too obsessive bashing of his bete noir Fred Newman. You can refer to versions under my username and Mr King's (most recently posting as IP 208.222.71.17) and discussion page. Mr King is also seeming to solicit would be vandals to jump into the fray (see post Mr King from ex-iwp.org message board under his user name "wordsmith", some of which has been cited on the discussion page.)

<p>Quimby is well-known as perhaps the predecessor to Eddy. Many people think she lifted a major part of her teachings from Quimby before he died. Some people dispute that. It's a source of controversy in the church and for her personally. He is quite relevant to her early career. In fact, perhaps the single, most relevant figure. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 13:42, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes the article says "In the 1860s she began to explore faith healing and associated with Phineas Quimby. His influence on her is disputed; the Christian Science Church maintains she thought highly of him personally but ultimately disavowed his technique as more mesmerism-based than Christian. However, there are many passages in her work "Science and Health" that mirror passages in Quimby's writings." However, I'm not disputing the article content. According to <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>, for a link to be included it has to provide relevant information about the subject. The Quimby link doesn't appear to provide any further information about <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Baker_Eddy_01fc.html" title="Mary Baker Eddy">Mary Baker Eddy</a> and in this context should be removed. <a href="../../../a/d/d/User%7EAddhoc_21d7.html" title="User:Addhoc">Addhoc</a> 13:49, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>From a biographical point-of-view, I think providing a link to a site which discusses more in-depth her predecessor or who she got her ideas from (possibly) is relevant to her own article. It's not only relevant to his article, since part of her biography discusses her ideas, and if they came from him, then it's relevant to have a link to details about him that may not be on his wikipedia article itself. It is, at the least, a rational argument, and thus shouldn't be removed as if there was no justification whatsoever.

<dd>If I can chime in here (and I don't feel strongly about this) there's already a link to the Wikipedia article on Phineas Quimby in the first paragraph. The external link is also provided from that page. I'm not sure what the official Wikipedia style position is on redundant links, but from a minimalist position less is better. (For the record I agree that some reference to Phineas Quimby is appropriate. His relationship to Mary Baker Eddy is important to an understanding of the roots of Christian Science.) <a href="../../../d/i/g/User%7EDigitalican_b532.html" title="User:Digitalican">Digitalican</a> 23:12, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello. I would like to request your assistance in dealing with a matter over CS Lewis. I have proposed a critics section that allows a critique of his philosophy and most others agree to this idea, however they seem to only agree to information that does not truly conflict with Lewis' views... I have offered quotes from Einstein, a Professor from New York, and Sigmund Freud and one individual claimed they were not original research. I would to resolve this duspute for when I asked for suggestions on how to change things none replied.
