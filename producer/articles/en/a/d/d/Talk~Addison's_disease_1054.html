<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/d/Talk%7EAddison%27s_disease_1054.html" title="Edit section: Hydrocortisone is Cortisol">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Hydrocortisone is Cortisol</span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../c/o/r/Cortisone.html" title="Cortisone">Cortisone</a> is <b>not</b> cortisol, it is a less active metabolite of it. Cortisone injections are used for joint injuries, to temporarily reduce inflammation. These injections are intramuscular, and are not the same thing as the intravenous hydrocortisone/cortisol used for Addisonian crises. Please don't mess with medical terms unless you've researched them first.</p>
<p>That said, I'm of two minds as to whether we should use the term hydrocortisone at all. It's more readily recognized than cortisol, and seems to be used for pharmacologic cortisol. The problem is that from what I've seen, hydrocortisone is used mostly for anti-itch and anti-allergy applications, rather than <i>endocrine</i> ones. I'm tempted to just change all references to cortisol, in order to make it clear that we're talking about in a purely endocrine context, not as allergy medicine. <a href="../../../k/a/j/User%7EKajerm_77ec.html" title="User:Kajerm">Kajerm</a> 21:56, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As this confusion is very prevalent, I think it essential to mention and clarify. Hydrocortisone <i>is</i> used for endocrine and rheumatologic purposes, but of course, topical hydrocortisone is more familiar to most people these days. Still, I think it makes sense to follow standard usage, and use the term "hydrocortisone" when speaking pharmacologically, and "cortisol" when speaking physiologically. The clarification should specifically indicate that is how the terms are used.</p>
<p>It would be worth mentioning the relationship of cortisone to cortisol, particularly since cortisone acetate has been (and rarely, still is) used as treatment for Addison's. There's a pair of enzymes, 11Î² hydroxy-steroid dehydrogenase, types 1 and 2, which interconvert between cortisol and cortisone.</p>
<p>Prednisone and other glucocorticoid steroids are also used. Prednisone is similar to cortisone, and is converted by the same enzymes to prednisolone, which is the active drug.</p>
<p>BTW, the IV/injectible hydrocortisone used is generally hydrocortisone sodium succinate (generally, brand-name Solu-Cortef), an ester of cortisol, which quickly converts to cortisol. Methylprednisolone sodium succinate (Solu-Medrol) and dexamethasone are also used.</p>
<p>The article could use more pharmacology and physiology links to Wikipedia content.</p>
<p>Also, a better description of the ACTH/synthecin stimulation test used to diagnose the condition. And the term "adrenal insuufficiency" needs to appear, as that's the general descriptive term. Thomas Addison's original 1855 paper can be found (in scanned form) at <a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1033929" class="external free" title="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1033929" rel="nofollow">http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1033929</a>; a link would be appropriate.</p>
<p>You can find a lot of info in my Furl archive: <a href="http://www.furl.net/members/rwkrwk" class="external free" title="http://www.furl.net/members/rwkrwk" rel="nofollow">http://www.furl.net/members/rwkrwk</a>.</p>
<p>No mention of DHEA, which is also generally missing in primary Addison's.</p>
<p>Also, this should be hooked in with the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Medicine_54a3.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Medicine">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Medicine</a> project. That's in addition to the canine connection. The canine connection is important because of its higher degree of prevalence in various breeds gives us a lot more information on the disease. (Rats don't help much -- they use corticosterone instead of cortisol).</p>

<p>--- I have seen in my research online that most articles speak at least briefly to the risks associated with Addison's and buth surgery and pregnancy, but I don't see either mentioned here so I wondered if they both should be. Perhaps an entire main section on "Addison's and daily life activities."</p>
<p>--- Also, I have searched and searched (online, using Google as my launching point) and have found nothing on Addison's impact on relationships, to include friendships, business dealings and intimacy/marriages (and the like). I was wondering 1. if this would make a worthwhile addition to this article and 2. what some common experiences and observations are regarding these from those who know firsthand: those with Addison's.</p>

<p>Like any chronic condition, there can be broad consequences. Fatigue can be a feature at times, even with optimal treatment. Stress is harder to manage. But I find diabetes to have a much larger impact on my life on a day-to-day basis. Of course, <i>untreated</i> Addison's impact on everything is profound. Before diagnosis, I was unable to even sit up for more than a couple hours. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobKerns_3266.html" title="User:BobKerns">Bob Kerns</a> 21:03, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

As someone that has had Addison's Disease for four years now it has not changed my life at all. The only times it has affected my life are during times of more stress than normal such as being sick or when you are "stressing" out over something. My doctor has advised to double the normal the daily dose of prednisone and florinef in those situations. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheckmate911_4427.html" title="User:Checkmate911">Checkmate911</a> 14:13, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>--- Also, I saw that the symptom "Loss of consciousness" WikiLinks to "Coma." I think this may not be best as a coma is significantly different (and far more severe) than losing consciousness. Yes, loss of consciousness may lead to a coma, but a coma is a different phenomenon and losses of consciousness usually are not coma-producing. Is there a better way to WikiLink these? (Also, if Coma specifically is a "symptom" of Addison's, it should be stated as such!) <a href="../../../v/i/g/User%7EVigilancePrime_1989.html" title="User:VigilancePrime">VigilancePrime</a> 11:37, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>--- Not to be bothersome with all this, but I wondered something and thought this the best place to find out. I have found that most of the articles and research I have come across refers to persons with Addison's Disease as "Addisonians." I was wondering if this is an accepted term among those with Addison's? (For instance, members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints are often called, simply, "Mormon," but for a long time this term was not used by LDS members and was often considered offensive, but now is becoming accepted, even used in a recent LDS television ad - as a parallel example.) <a href="../../../v/i/g/User%7EVigilancePrime_1989.html" title="User:VigilancePrime">VigilancePrime</a> 11:37, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>--- By the same token, if any of my wording in the additions to this article are less-than-ideal (for instance, to avoid repetition, I vary terms and use words such as "afflicted," "sufferer," and "Addisonian"). PLEASE let me know if any of these are considered improper and/or derogatory in any way. <a href="../../../v/i/g/User%7EVigilancePrime_1989.html" title="User:VigilancePrime">VigilancePrime</a> 11:37, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I removed a claim that Addisons Disease is "never hereditary". My reading suggests that some causes are hereditary, and the article <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autoimmune_polyendocrine_syndrome.html" title="Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome">Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome</a>, which is a major cause of the disease clearly shows that some forms of the syndrome are a result of inherited mutations. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertbrockway_3ea2.html" title="User:Robertbrockway">Robertbrockway</a> 05:23, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Chronic stress can and does precipitate Addison's. I suppose emotional malnutrition and anger at the self would be two causes of that. Psychological factors certainly do deserve a mention. Zinc deficiency and copper toxicity would be two common concomitant conditions impairing adrenal function. I've seen some relatively serious cases caused by the above three alone. Also, I haven't seen one case of this that didn't show some degree of hypothyroidism aswell.<small>âThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 81.108.30.175 (<a href="../../../8/1/2E/User_talk%7E81.108.30.175.html" title="User talk:81.108.30.175">talk</a> â¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_81.108.30.175_54ca.html" title="Special:Contributions/81.108.30.175">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<p>What on Earth does "emotional malnutrition" mean? Anything at all? I know what stress is, and if it can cause this condition, I would support including it, but I suspect "emotional malnutrition" is meaningless crap. It sounds like something out of some hippie self-help book, and not medical at all. If this is a real medical term, however, please clarify. Emily</p>

<p>I know this probably shouldn't go here, but I couldn't resist as people knowledgable in this area will read this. I have gone through some chest/upper stomach pains, dizzyness, fainting (this is whilst driving btw) and then finding myself really hot/cold needing the aircon on full and my face is full white - is it possible that it could be a result of me currently tapering my prednisolone dosage?!?! I have been on pred for the past 6 months, and also 6 months around 2 years ago. I began tapering about a month or two ago, from 25mg to 12.5mg to 10mg and currently at 7.5mg. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Cheers. [User:Timeshift9|Timeshift]] 15:33, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not a regular Wikipedia updater, but here's something for research. My dog, Fraiser, has Addison's. He takes predisone, and another medication whose name I cannot recall, but both are steroids. While addison's is treatable, it is not curable in dogs, and therefore he must remain on medication for the rest of his life. Due to the medicine he is taking, it is likely that he will not live as long as he otherwise would, as the medicine leads to other problems, specifically kidney failure later in life.</p>
<p>Also, while on his medication, he acts perfectly normal and active. There is no hint that he has addison's. That may also be worth noting. And our vet advised that he take a calcium suppliment, as the medicine also affects those levels.</p>
<p>Again, I am only speaking for my dog, but I know the disease is rare and the information may be useful. As far as I understand, these things about Fraiser are common to dogs with the disease. Thanks. Dave</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, those sound the same as my dog, Dottie. She was diagnosed with Addison's less than a year ago after having a near-fatal Addisonian crisis. But after tha one event she hasn't changed a bit. We just have to keep an eye on her, and if she starts acting weird in <b>any</b> way we take her to the vet immediately. She also has to go every month to get shots and tests done to make sure everything is running smoothly, which it has so far. I just put this page on my watchlist so I might try adding to the Canine section a little. <a href="../../../k/o/n/User%7EKonman72_ac5b.html" title="User:Konman72">Konman72</a> 07:39, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
