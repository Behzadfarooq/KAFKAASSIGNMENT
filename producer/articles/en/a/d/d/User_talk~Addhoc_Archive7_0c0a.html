<p>Thanks for your message. If you can convince me that I am wrong as far as my understanding of wikipedia's policies is concerned, I will remove the link in question myself, if its included by a third party again, I will myself remove it again. But if you are convinced by my logic, please assure me that you will let sense prevail.</p>
<p>Let me state the obvious, Venu62 has had bad relations with me right from the start, but I know he is a good contributor otherwise, and he contributes mostly to articles that are about Tamil. There was a big dispute on the same <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carnatic_music.html" title="Carnatic music">Carnatic music</a> article in the recent past where he was pushing for undue mention of Tamil music. Since I vehemently opposed it and made him withdraw from his POV pushing etc, he has an axe to grind against me. He would try to justify all his actions saying I'm a spammer etc, but I dont want to get into all that here. Though I dont have anything personal against him, he cant stand me and has constantly tried to pick faults with my edits and articles in particular, and I have not returned the favour yet.</p>
<p>Venu62's <b>content</b> contribution to Carnatic Music related articles is zilch (nothing substantial in any single article) as far as I have seen.</p>
<p>Some people are morons in just one aspect, and its hard to shake them off your back. They keep picking at you and make your life miserable to derive perverse pleasure in causing pain to others.</p>
<p>As regards Ncmvocalist and A4ay, their past contributions will make their intentions and their level of contributions abundantly clear. See their talk pages and edit histories. ­ <span class="sigSrkris" style="background:gold;color:#FF0000"><big>ॐ</big> <a href="../../../s/r/k/User%7ESrkris_bf65.html" title="User:Srkris">Kris</a> (<a href="../../../s/r/k/User_talk%7ESrkris_6c1c.html" title="User talk:Srkris">☎ talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_srkris_629a.html" title="Special:Contributions/srkris">contribs</a>)</span> 17:35, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I had to butt in as I'm being personally abused here again by Srkris. Let us get the full picture here. Srkris makes it as if I came to Carnatic music to pick fight with him. Far from the truth. In fact Srkris's initial contributions were limited to inserting links to his websites to hundreds of articles related or unrelated to carnatic music. I have been contributing to Carnatic music related articles for a long time. Here is a sample of articles and stubs I have created/substantially edited relating to Carnatic music. You can see the article history to verify my claim:</dd>

<p>Okay. Maybe I'm looking too hard for a connection here, but hear me out:</p>
<ul>
<li>The vandalism in the <a href="../../../r/o/d/Rodney_King_f40c.html" title="Rodney King">Rodney King</a> article that Keltik31 reverted was left by anon IP 84.169.183.1*. * That IP originates from Wiesbaden, Germany on some searches, Amsterdam on another search, and Marina Del Rey, California on yet another search...so maybe I need to learn how to search IPs more accurately.</li>
<li>There is a <a href="http://www.wiesbaden.army.mil/sites/local/" class="external text" title="http://www.wiesbaden.army.mil/sites/local/" rel="nofollow">US Army garrison</a> in Wiesbaden.</li>
<li>Keltik31 admits to being in the US military <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Halloween&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=85284199" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Halloween&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=85284199" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Halloween&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=85305249" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Halloween&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=85305249" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Coincidence? I don't know Keltik31's IP, so I can't confirm that they did <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rodney_King&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=90662914" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rodney_King&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=90662914" rel="nofollow">this</a>, but I think the chances of him <i>knowing</i> the person who vandalized the page for him to "revert" are good, if indeed Keltik31 is in the military.</p>
<p>The id "keltik31" gets <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Keltik31&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;filter=0" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=Keltik31&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;filter=0" rel="nofollow">245 hits</a> on Google.

<dd>Completely agree with you, the anon only made a single edit and IMHO the whole thing was a set up for talk page trolling. That said, my understanding is the RfC is already successful, so we only need evidence of an ongoing problem and then we can take it to ArbCom and get him banned. <a href="../../../a/d/d/User%7EAddhoc_21d7.html" title="User:Addhoc">Addhoc</a> 20:21, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The thought crossed my mind too, but I am very uncomfortable accusing a user of this kind of behavior without a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCU_026f.html" title="WP:RFCU">checkuser</a> result to back it up. That's why I removed it from the RfC page. If a checkuser request is made and shows they are the same, it should be re-added to the RfC, but per <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> I don't think it should be there until then. --<a href="../../../g/i/n/User%7EGinkgo100_66a1.html" title="User:Ginkgo100">Ginkgo</a><a href="../../../g/i/n/User%7EGinkgo100_Esperanza_6689.html" title="User:Ginkgo100/Esperanza"><font color="green">100</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/i/n/User_talk%7EGinkgo100_02a2.html" title="User talk:Ginkgo100"><i>talk</i></a></sup> 20:45, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm the editor who noticed Keltik's reversion of the Rodney King vandalism, deleted his addition of it to the RK talk page, and listed it as disputed behaviour in the RfC. While it certainly crossed my mind that Keltik orchestrated the whole thing to backdoor a racist slur into Wikipedia, none of his other contributions suggest to me that he is subtle enough for that. I just think he took advantage of run-of-the-mill vandalism to backdoor a racist slur into Wikipedia. I revert vandalism every day, as do countless other editors. I have never before seen an editor copy the vandalism he reverted onto a talk page to explain that he had to remove it. I don't think that edit was made in good faith and I don't think he should be let off the hook for it. We don't need to prove that he put it in the article; we have an edit history that shows plainly that he put it on the talk page. - <a href="../../../e/r/o/User%7EEronMain_e7ee.html" title="User:EronMain">Eron</a> 21:25, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think that's the likely scenario. On the 9/11 talk page, Keltik31 questioned whether the attackers were terrorists. After another editor responded by saying something to the effect of terrorism is still terrorism, regardless of the motive, Keltik31 posted that Israel is a terrorist nation. I think he/she was trying to provoke a response (to the comment questioning if the attackers were terrorists) just so he/she could express his anti-Semitism.

<p>Hey, are you trying to be a mediator on the Carnatic Music article or merely siding with some of the editors? If its the former, I dont see you are interested in establishing any understanding on the issue. You are taking a bird's eye view of the issue and forming opinions before discussion. This is unhelpful, its not going to resolve the dispute. First ask A4ay and Ncmvocalist to stop their edits there and ask them to behave. I am reverting the edits of these two who are not showing any maturity to engage in a productive discussion. See their total contribution history and their talk pages. Let me see whether you are able to first make them engage sensibly. Thanks. If you are not going to discuss properly the reasons for inclusion/exclusion of the link other than just linking to WP:EL and WP:COI, the mediation wont work. ­ <span class="sigSrkris" style="background:gold;color:#FF0000"><big>ॐ</big> <a href="../../../s/r/k/User%7ESrkris_bf65.html" title="User:Srkris">Kris</a> (<a href="../../../s/r/k/User_talk%7ESrkris_6c1c.html" title="User talk:Srkris">☎ talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_srkris_629a.html" title="Special:Contributions/srkris">contribs</a>)</span> 16:40, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am sure you are right. But, I doubt that the bias is deliberate (though there are always exceptions) it is the result of individuals only being able to write on those subjects that they are familiar with. The advantage of Wikipedia is when you write crap someone challenges it or corrects.

<dd>Thanks for answering. I have been thinking all afternoon. I thought I understood <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is a policy but I am not sure anymore. If it is true that it is a policy, then all these discussions about me and the fact tags would not have been going on over and over again in various forums for the last four months.

There is no signature. This strikes me as rather extraordinary and excessive. I'm concerned, particularly since I've seen Mattisse is considering leaving Wikipedia for a while. My impression was that investigation had found that Mattisse had done nothing wrong in this matter? I guess technically Hanuman Das is not doing anything wrong by identifying Mattisse as the author, but it certainly feels like a punitive action. I don't know if I'm asking you to do anything. It just feels nasty to me. I happened to catch this because I have pretty much all of the Starwood link pages on my watchlist.

The whole current situation was <i>created</i> by Mattisse using sockpuppets.

This is <i>specificly</i> mentioned on <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> as being an abusive use of sockpuppets!

<p>Since you are my Advocate, perhaps you would give me some advice. I am wondering whether to ask a question on the new <a href="../../../s/t/a/Talk%7EStarwood_Festival_mediation_80a7.html" title="Talk:Starwood Festival/mediation">Talk:Starwood Festival/mediation</a> now opening. Specifically, I was looking at the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_H._Farber_004a.html" title="Philip H. Farber">Philip H. Farber</a> article and wondering about the 3 internal links (plus 2 external links) to Rosencomet. Since the internal links are to three different Rosencomet parent articles: <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starwood_Festival_bc88.html" title="Starwood Festival">Starwood Festival</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/n/WinterStar_Symposium_a3e4.html" title="WinterStar Symposium">WinterStar Symposium</a> and <a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_for_Consciousness_Exploration_c248.html" title="Association for Consciousness Exploration">Association for Consciousness Exploration</a>, do they count separately or together? My question to you is this (it's a political question):</p>
<ol>
<li>Should I just stay out of it now as a person who causes more trouble and distraction to the process and let others take care of it?</li>
<li>Should I weigh in because if I don't I lose the right to have a say? (I was advised previously this might be the case on the first Starwood mediation, as I initially stayed out of it.) Plus am I expected to or not? I can't tell.</li>
<li>Should I stay out of it because I start to feel sick to my stomach and get anxious about what might happen if I do stick my nose in? (I think this was the article that when I AFD'ed it originally provoked 999 into retaliation.)</li>
<li>Should I weigh in because the last comment indicates that I've lost my bearings, am taking everything way to seriously and need to get over all my fright and act normal?</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a true request for advice, asking the benefit of your political judgment and tact as I seem to lack both. So I am not asking what my rights are or anything like that. I am trying to figure out how normal people act around here without causing all the ruckus I seem to. And I do not want to cause more trouble or hinder anything. But, also, I don't want to get stuck being nervous about everything I do as I am now. (Be Bold!) Thank you.

<dd>Hi Matisse, clearly the amount of internal and external links is excessive. Regarding your question:
<ol>
<li>No, the users who have introduced these links, instead of explaining their actions, are being hostile in response.</li>
<li>Regarding mediation, I would suggest you shouldn't consider that your involvement is expected. You have notified the wider community of the problem and beyond this you don't have any obligation. Mediation isn't usually a long winded debate, more often the discussion is lead by the mediator. Accordingly, if you want to be involved then a short note on the mediation page would be sufficient.</li>
<li>I am concerned about your stress levels. Even if you aren't involved there are other editors who understand the problem. Regardless of your decision, I would suggest you avoid debating the problem.</li>
<li>No, however if you decide to be involved then, I would suggest you post a short note on the mediation page and then wait for <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheNuevara_65d1.html" title="User:CheNuevara">CheNuevara</a> to start the process.</li>

<p>I'm sorry if I mistakenly asked for wikibreak. I did not mean to do so. I just want to withdraw from the Advocacy program as it has made things worse. I wanted to learn about how to use Wikipedia but I learn only accidently when you have made a comment or intervened and I am not learning your rationale. And there are probably many comments I don't know about and would have to hunt around to find. So I am not learning much from that. Ususally if I see a comment by you it is way after the fact so I miss its impact. You made one on my talk page and that was effective but it doesn't help me for the future.</p>
<p>Right now I need to use diffs and watchlists, and other things that I don't know enough about. I don't understand the terminology and I was hoping you would help me. I was also hoping you would guide me more. I need someone who can relate to me more in my terms. You assume I already know things. When I asked you to explain Ars Scriptors comment, your reply was not helpful. (I don't even know what his role is supposed to be -- just that he makes me an object of ridicule in Mattisse Redux - which I guess he thinks is clever.) I ask you for some real feedback via email but I did not gotten anything helpful. Instead I was lulled into a false sense of security and now I am in worse shape than before. If I just spend my time writing and editing there is always trouble brewing in the background for me. I find it strange that no one ever looks into what has actually happened or what I have actually done. They just go by what other people say. Those who are clever with diffs etc. have the upper hand. No one has actually looked at facts. Advocacy appears to be a feel good thing and that only makes things worse in the situaion I am in. I think it is better if I go it alone. I thank you for the effort you did put in and if you know of a method that would be more helpful to me than advocacy maybe you will recommend it. And please take me off wikibreak if that is my status now. Sincerely, Mattisse 15:14, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You wrote, "the swastika predates Hinduism." Of course this pre-dates Hindu Dharma. It was used first by the ancient Indians who would later become Hindu and then peoples in Iran, Mid-East, Europe and the Americas began using this. The swastika was an important symbol to Hindu Dharma and so Shri Gautam Buddha used this as his symbol.

<dd>Of course, firstly, this isn't about whether you are nice, decent, honest Wikipedian - you very obviously are. However, your answer to Q1 was slightly uninspiring. Personally, I don't consider requested moves to be a big deal. I hold the view that Wikipedians should be mature enough to agree consensus and to move pages without supervision. That's probably just me though. Also, yes I kinda assumed that you and every other sensible Wikipedian issues vandal warnings and reports them. So I guessed that you would block them, instead of reporting, because to be honest, that's obvious. Really the minimum would be to indicate that you would help clear the backlog at AIV when it gets busy. Also, what about saying that you have enough experience of the deletion process to close AfDs? Or just saying that you would monitor the backlogs and help out with the most urgent? Finally, if you understand the mysteries of US copyright law, you could help out with image deletions. Also don't bother saying "I would let others change the culture of Wikipedia by administrative action", in reality most new admins take a while before they have much influence.</dd>
<dd>Your answer to question 2 was better, if you had written several featured articles, that would be impressive, however nothing wrong here. On the other hand nothing to convince me that you definitely should have more buttons.

<dd>In fact, I had a substantial part in the final polishing of <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonia_%28terminology%29.html" title="Macedonia (terminology)">Macedonia (terminology)</a>, now on the main page; but it wasn't as much fun as the earlier stuff listed; but since it's topical, I will add it. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 22:29, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your answer to question 3 should have explained why you went over 3RR. Also, your list of Wikipedians that you've crossed swords with appears to be incomplete - judging by the oppose voters.
<dl>
<dd>Cross swords with? No. Disagree with a position I've taken? Yes. Cyde, for example, disagrees with many positions I've taken, and I don't think he should have been promoted; but it's not something I've ever felt stress over. He's never picked on anything I value; just other people. Should question 3 be reworded? I answered it as it was written. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 22:29, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, It has gone beyond the ridiculous in this article.

<p>Hey Addhoc, I'm mediating the Starwood case. It seems to me that so far Mattisse has declined to involve herself in the mediation, although she has responded to a few comments left by others on my talk page. I'm not interested in taking action against Mattisse or any other user; I'm only interested in ending the content dispute. I would appreciate it, however, if you would let me know what your view on the Mattisse / alternate accounts, Mattisse / Hunaman Das - Ekajati, and Mattisse / Rosencomet issues are. It would be a great help to me.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot!</p>
<p>Peace. - <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheNuevara_65d1.html" title="User:CheNuevara"><font color="#F0B400">Che</font> <font color="#004411">Nuevara</font></a> 02:53, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you for voting in my RfA which at 51/20/6 unfortunately did not achieve consensus. In closing the nomination, <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> remarked that it was one of the better discussed RfAs seen recently and I would like to thank you and all others who chose to vote for making it as such. It was extremely humbling to see the large number of support votes, and the number of oppose votes and comments will help me to become stronger. I hope to run again for adminship soon. Thank you all once more. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiwoohoo_4afe.html" title="User:Wikiwoohoo">Wikiwoohoo</a> 19:49, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
