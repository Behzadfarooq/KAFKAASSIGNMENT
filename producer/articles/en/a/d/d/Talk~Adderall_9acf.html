<p>Does every slang name for adderall need to listed in this article? It seems fairly pointless. I suggest that we remove all but the most common. Any thoughts? <a href="../../../f/o/o/User%7EFoolishben_2b03.html" title="User:Foolishben">Foolishben</a> 05:32, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Update: I went ahead and removed all the slang terms for adderall. There are plenty of websites that have endless lists of slang terms for drugs. We do not need to waste space and bandwidth for such widely available knowlage. I also removed the link to a personal website used for citation. It was terribly written and very poorly sourced. Had the website been fantastic I still would have removed it. If you cite something cite the origional research, not just another artical that uses the research.<a href="../../../f/o/o/User%7EFoolishben_2b03.html" title="User:Foolishben">Foolishben</a> 21:17, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>There's some dispute as to whether "bennies" is actually a slang term for Adderall (although I might be on my own saying it isn't).</p>
<p>My point was that "benny" refers to either benzodiazepines (irrelevant) or <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benzedrine.html" title="Benzedrine">benzedrine</a>. Benzedrine is closely related to Adderall, but not the same thing. Specifically, Adderall is a mix of amphetamine salts, while Benzedrine is a variant of <a href="../../../a/m/p/Amphetamine.html" title="Amphetamine">amphetamine</a> itself. Perhaps I'm being a bit pedantic, though -- certainly more pedantic than teenagers and their durn drug slang!&#160;:) <a href="../../../a/d/k/User%7EAdking80_47ed.html" title="User:Adking80">Adking80</a> 15:55, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Uhh, yeah, any drug that has analogous effects can have the same slang applied to both. This somewhat stems from the fact that all illegally produced drugs offer different highs between batches, brands, and genetics. There are two general types of weed, X is more often than not doped with different speeds and hallucinogens. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndolering_15c5.html" title="User:Indolering">Indolering</a></p>

I just edited the "External links" section to include two websites which do not focus on negative aspects of this medication. Part of the reason I added these was for their factual content (e.g., the second website reports the relative effectiveness of Adderall <i>vis a vis</i> Ritalin SR), but another was because the existing three externally linked websites were each focused on harmful aspects of Adderall, which in my reckoning added perceived bias to the Wikipedia article (although not necessarily in the external articles themselves). Make no mistake, this is a powerful medicine, with potential for abuse—however, it also has helped many, many people control their ADHD symptoms and the great majority of people prescribed Adderall do not abuse their medication. --<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanaxp_4e21.html" title="User:Ryanaxp">Ryanaxp</a> 15:01, Feb 16, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Something got screwed up here - I will clean up this article when I get the chance. But the section on Tolerance is poorly backed up at best; it smacks of being lifted from an herbal-remedy page. I haven't seen good evidence that tolerance is an issue with these drugs in therapuetic doses, and the magnesium solution just isn't in agreement with the NMDA article. For that matter, NDMA as a means of achieving tolerance seems wrong; and again I sure can't find any evidence of a link.</p>
<p>Certainly there's an NPOV problem in advocating a certain treatment (Magnesium)... I don't think wikipedia has any place doing so.</p>
<p>If, somehow, the tolerance stuff is accurate, it should be included in all the amphetamine-related articles. Right now, none of them even contain the word "tolerance". Given the lack of conclusive study or at least a half-decent source, I will edit this section out shortly.</p>
<p>Also it is stated that the drug has a "short half-life", but in the same page, the half-life is mentioned as being 10-13 hours.</p>
<p>--<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimboOmega_0ff1.html" title="User:JimboOmega">JimboOmega</a> 23:00, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Regarding the half-life issue, I think this particular confusion stems from mixed-up terminology because there are two separate types of half-lives that are not sufficiently differentiated in the article. Although the <i>elimination</i> half-life of Adderall may indeed be between 10-13 hours, this is a different half-life from <i>plasma</i> half-life which is more correlated to the effective time-period of the drug (and which is in fact rather short for amphetamine-class pharms like Adderall). Therefore, I re-added the sentence mentioning the short-term effects of Adderall caused by its short half-life, but I modified it to clarify that this refers to the <b>plasma</b> half-life of Adderall (rather than the elimination half-life). --<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanaxp_4e21.html" title="User:Ryanaxp">Ryanaxp</a> 15:32, May 17, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think you've still got it wrong. If you look at the <a href="http://www.adderallxr.com/pdf/prescribing_information.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.adderallxr.com/pdf/prescribing_information.pdf" rel="nofollow">the prescribing information (PDF)</a>, you will see that the plasma concentration peaks late (with adderall XR, almost 8 hours after initial dosing). A significant amount remains in the plasma even 24 hours after administration (more than a third of peak).</p>
<p>It is, however, a matter of some debate as to how plasma concentration relates to effectiveness. Some users in an ADD forum I frequent complain of declining effectiveness past 5 hours, even with XR, so it's hypothesized that the alleviation of symptoms is best noticed by the CHANGE in plasma concentration. It hasn't been satisfactorily proved to me; Shire's research has shown effectiveness at 4 hours to be similiar to effectiveness at 12 hours. My personal theory is that changing concentration is most noticeable to the user, but in fact total concentration is most relevant to smyptom control. This is not a scientifically tested fact by any stretch, though.</p>
<p>It's also thought these effects could be very different for those without ADD, and it's *also* thought that a dose that's too high can actually impair concentration -- this together could be taken to imply that for a non-ADD person to use the medication, the therapuetic benefits could be very minimal and only in a certain (small) range of plasma concentration.</p>
<p>--<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimboOmega_0ff1.html" title="User:JimboOmega">JimboOmega</a> 16:10, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I may well have it wrong; certainly (regrettably?), I'm not a pharmacologist. I'm sure you understand the significance, but it also bears mentioning that Adderall XR would of course be expected to have a prolonged presence in the plasma compared to "straight" Adderall, but that is probably more attributable to the extended release feature than to the half-life of the amphetamine ingredients themselves.
<p>Also, although this has no bearing on the article, I can contribute my own anecdotal two cents and emphatically agree that subjectively at least, Adderall wears off rather sooner than I wish it would—despite the fact that its plasma concentration might remain fairly steady. It's frustrating because the doct takes a skeptical view when I report this, probably because the blurb in the <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physician%27s_Desk_Reference_8172.html" title="Physician's Desk Reference">PDR</a> makes no mention of this effect. --<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanaxp_4e21.html" title="User:Ryanaxp">Ryanaxp</a> 01:29, May 18, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a question about food consumption and "prolonging" Tmax. What exactly does it mean to "prolong?" Take this except from Shire:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Food does not affect the extent of absorption of d-amphetamine and l-amphetamine, but prolongs Tmax by 2.5 hours (from 5.2 hrs at fasted state to 7.7 hrs after a high-fat meal) for d-amphetamine and 2.1 hours (from 5.6 hrs at fasted state to 7.7 hrs after a high fat meal) for l-amphetamine after administration of ADDERALL XR® 30 mg. Opening the capsule and sprinkling the contents on applesauce results in comparable absorption to the intact capsule taken in the fasted state. Equal doses of ADDERALL XR® strengths are bioequivalent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could someone possibly explain in laymen terms what it means for Tmax to be "prolonged" from 5.2 to 7.7 hours. Does that mean Tmax will last 2.5 hours <i>longer</i> or you won't reach Tmax until 2.5 hours <i>later</i>. I would think "longer" because it says food does affect the absorption of Adderall, so how would it make Tmax later? Again, I have no idea and I am just trying to make sense of things. No where on the web is this cleared up as everyone takes their pharmacokinetics section directly from Shire. Also, what does it mean to be bioequivalent in this context?</p>

<dd>The real problem is that, unfortunately, many of today's professors not only tolerate cramming, but actually encourage it! In an ideal world, where no one forgets what school was originally for - no one would ever need to use stimulants to study.

<dd>I'm glad to see the "abuse" section has been expanded, as many people will come here to write about it. I added a bit about the cognitive effects of Adderall (rather, dextroamphetamine)but there is quite a bit more. It's all on google scholar, I'm just a bit too lazy to cite it all. Adderall has the same attentional-enhancing effects in "normal" subjects as ADHD. One study found that users' IQs increased an average of 5 points after a year of constant use (though the subjects were children diagnosed with ADHD). I added that double blind study which was very impressive, since it used normal subjects. Dextroamphetamine is also used by the military for fighter pilots. It's difficult to find anything really recent looking at the effects of Adderall (dextroamphetamine) on normal subjects, likely because most of the funding would be going towards looking at the effects on ADHD kids.</dd>

<p>INCOMPLETE AND INAPROPRIATE ARTICLE: I posted the followingt coment elsewhere here, but I just found that i posated it in the wrong place. In any case, I don't understand the system hee for commentary, or if anyone will veen be able to read what I write...</p>
<p>Neither the word addiction, nor the word tolerance, appear anywhere at all in that article or its sources. Also, minimum trherapeutic and maximim dose are not indicated. These are thw two most important categories of information (addiction and dose) to be aware of with any controlled substances, and yet there is no mention of either. This suggests a clear bias in the article, and it renders the article incomplete and inappropriate at best.</p>

<p>In my experience, 30 mg pills (of either variety - standard release or XR) rarely cost more than 5 US dollars individually, or 2 in larger amounts. I'm not sure if they are just unusually available where I live or if the price range needs an adjustment downward.</p>
<p>In my experience, Adderall costs $1 for every 10 mg. That is for small amounts; in larger amounts some dealers will go as low as 20 cents per 10 mg. I don't know who to pose this to, but I do believe that the prices should be adjusted down. I was the one to edit the prices with the references, but if the references were not required, than I would have used the lower amounts. Anyway, to whom it may concern: the prices in the article are too high, but were the only prices I found online so they could be referenced. It's not that I condone the use of stimulants, and it's not like I use stimulants (just covering my butt is all). wickedspikes 22:55, 03 January 2006 (PST)</p>
<pre>
      $5 for 30mg? Its more like 15mg pills for 25 cents each, 50 cents for a 30mg.
</pre>
<p>I know people who buy Adderall XR 30 mg pills for $10 a piece. It probably deals more with supply/demand recognition. You have to consider that generally you can only get an Adderall prescription NORMALLY every 30 days, or however long your doctor prescribes you. It's not a refillable drug under law, so you must have your doctor prescribe you a knew bottle every time. Thus, you are at the mercy of your doctor. Also, certain health insurance companies enforce a 2 week waiting period before they will cover the costs of another $120 bottle. So even if your doctor would give you a prescription early there is a decent possibility your insurance company won't cover the costs, UNLESS you are prescribed a different dosage. In order for someone who is prescribed Adderall to sell his pills, they would have to be sure not to sell too many as to run out of enough pills for themselves. So, combine these "supply" factors with whatever demand is out there in your region it is very possible to sell a 30 mg XR for $10.00.</p>
<p>Neither the word addiction, nor the word tolerance, appear anywhere at all in that article or its sources. Also, minimum trherapeutic and maximim dose are not indicated. These are thw two most important categories of information (addiction and dose) to be aware of with any controlled substances, and yet there is no mention of either. This suggests a clear bias in the article, and it renders the article incomplete and inappropriate at best.</p>

<p>Someone mentioned wanting to know adderall's actual effects from a user of it...i'm sixteen and take it (prescription), both XR and fast-release. someone also mentioned lingo- that just reminded me, i'd assume that "fast" would be a nickname for fast-releases...if you're interested. um, yeah, if you take too much, your eyes will be really dilated and you'll feel unable to make yourself seem relaxed (sort of like a drunk person trying to be sober by oovverannunnnnccciatinnnngggg their wooorrrrrds). on adderall, i feel really organized, love to learn (sort of do anyway though, but it gives me time to), and if i take it in the afternoon and finish my work but still have the buzz, i have this urge to clean my room and organize everything in it... taking it makes me feel like my life is under control and i'm organized and getting better grades...while i'm on it, i have more anxiety and bite my nails too much (it doesn't really bother me; i just try to control it for others around me lol)...but long-term it releases stress because it enables me to study and read (i'm an extreeeeeeemely slow reader and comprehend noooothing) at a more normal pace, so i get better grades and learn more and don't feel quite so "stupid" or "slow". i'm not being arrogant - i'm really not dumb...i'm pretty smart, but add has prohibited me from showing that for a very long time. i think adderall, if anything, reduces my creativity...i'm very creative and love music, french, culture, art, you name it - anything to distract myself... but while i'm on adderall i discover some sort of secret passion for the sciences and math and my ideas aren't quite as creative. however, this is not a very big side effect. long-term, i think daily use of adderall (normal dosage, nothing "serious") can perhaps be very harmful...i mean, it's as if you've been hooked on cocaine since you were little. by the way, i don't feel addicted at all...i love how much adderall has allowed me to do because of add, but i'm not hooked.

<p>I'm adding a section on the blackbox warning placed on all amphetamine based ADD and ADHD drugs by the FDA recently. This warning was added because of the risk of sudden cardiac death and heart damage from long term use of the drug.</p>

<dd>I've removed this. Neither is there a black box warning on Adderall, nor is the discussion about warnings on stimulants due to adverse cardiac health effects from long term use.

<p>I'd like to see a section added about interactions. There have to be some, and considereing the potential for abuse, a segment on possible interactions would be very helpful.<a href="../../../n/u/t/User%7ENut-meg_ecbc.html" title="User:Nut-meg">nut-meg</a> 18:32, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm considering adding a very frightening and severe interaction which occurred to my girlfriend just yesterday, but am hesitant for the reason that I wouldn't be able to verify it properly. Here it is: Two days after discontinuing pretty mild alprazolam use that had been going on for about a week, she and I took pretty enormous doses of Adderall (we can't recall the precise amount, but it definitely wasn't less than 400 mg for each of us over a VERY brief period, perhaps 24-30 hours). While we each were enjoying an incredibly powerful high, she suffered three types of seizures in a row: first a secondarily generalized attack which neither of us recognized as a seizure, then, moments later, a generalized tonic-clonic seizure which prompted me to call an ambulence. While we waited for the ambulence, a complex partial seizure began and either continued throughout the ambulence ride, although the seizure in the ambulence may have been a separate complex partial seizure. She's fine now, but what a terrible thing to suffer! I should add two things: first, that she isn't prone to seizures naturally, although she did have a complex partial seizure once before as a result of a different drug interaction also involving alprazolam. Second, that the diagnosis of the various seizures was by actual doctors, and isn't simply my own amateur assessment. Wowbobwow12</p>
<p>Alprazolam (Xanax) does not interact adversely with amphetamines. It's much more likely that the large dose (400mg is over 10x more than the largest pill size) was the cause. I'll add something about interactions. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7EReb42_0a93.html" title="User:Reb42">Reb42</a> 21:01, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I highly doubt that it was an adverse interaction between the two. First of all, discontinuing alprazolam (or any benzo), even a small dose, can result in seizures on its own regardless of other drugs being taken. This is rare, but does effect some individuals. Secondly, 400mg of amphetamine is a MASSIVE dose that could quite possibly cause seizures on its own. In fact, people have died from much lower doses than that, you're lucky you survived... Regardless, I doubt it was the combination of the drugs. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 20:13, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah, that was almost certainly the 400 MG dosage. For normal patients 30-40 MG is considered on the high end. You took 10 times that.</p>

The whole side effects section needs a possible edit. I've read packages and never seen some of the side effects mentioned.

Furthermore side effects take up about a third of the length of the article. Could we not simply have an image of the written side effects from say Shire or some other reliable source?

The article is about Adderall which is a medication. None of your citations are valid with regards to this medication when it is taken at therapeutic levels as prescribed. Drug abuse or drug addiction can cause the all sorts of symptoms but that's not the point now is it? With drug abuse the drug is typically injected or snorted causing the instant high as all of the drug reaches the brian in a second or two. Then we have the crash that follows. When one ingests the drug it enters the body through the stomach lining and slowly reaches the brain. Alcohol injected into the body would also be a highly harmful drug. It's all in the delivery system and therefore your claims are consequently bogus. Stimulants taken as prescribed are one of the most safest AND effective classes of medication out there. --<a href="../../../s/c/u/User%7EScuro_f2bf.html" title="User:Scuro">scuro</a> 16:32, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's the same substance. Saying "it's all in the delivery system" is an excuse; by that standard about half of the side effect list should be removed from the article. The point remains that Adderall, as a prescription medication, when taken *as* prescribed, can cause side effects such as bruxism in certain people. Trying to find articles that explicitly state, "Adderall causes X, Y and Z" is going to be difficult; literature is going to say "amphetamine" instead. It's necessary to read somewhat deeper to settle this question.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Another thing: where does this emphasis on injection/insufflation come from? Neither was mentioned in any of the articles I linked. Surely you are not suggesting that it is impossible to abuse a drug by ingestion. Any amount of firsthand experience will prove that there is also a "crash" when Adderall is taken orally. <b>Yes, delivery mechanism does influence the absorption time, but saying "drug abuse involves injection/snorting, and your articles are about drug abusers, therefore none of them apply" is just not true. It may be the case that certain side effects (re: the original point of contention, bruxism) occur only with higher amounts outside the bounds of normally accepted doses; I don't disagree. My original goal here is to offer a counterpoint to your earlier statements about how a sample size of one is insignificant with research linking amphetamine-based drugs and bruxism, and I feel that I have successfully done that. If you believe I am in error, please cite your sources.</b> <a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMystic_Pixel_429d.html" title="User:Mystic Pixel">Mystic Pixel</a> 05:18, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is ALL ABOUT THE DELIVERY SYSTEM. You call this an "excuse", and I rely on clinical studies that support my points. <i>"Reinforcing effects occur when methylphenidate elicits large and fast dopamine increases that mimic those of phasic dopamine cell firing, whereas therapeutic effects occur when methylphenidate elicits slow, steady-state dopamine increases that mimic those of tonic firing. Thus, the characteristics of clinical use (low doses administered orally and titrated for therapeutic effects) constrain methylphenidate’s abuse".</i> <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> Here is a study that shows that therapeutic levels of stimulants actually decrease the likelihood of stimulant abuse. It's "the same substance", how can that be? Stimulants are just supposed to be bad, no???!??</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Is bruxism mentioned as a clinically proven side effect of Adderall? I haven't found that in literature and it looks like you are having a hard time as well. You say we "need to read deeper", I call that going out on a limb to make an insupportable point for who knows what reason. Theraputic stimulants are one of the safest and most effective classes of drugs out there but abuse the drug and it is highly dangerous. Take it as prescribed and it has been clinically shown to reduce the symptoms of ADHD for 9/10 of those with ADHD.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>By the way, the articles you cited ARE all about drug abuse. No where in them do I read "therapeutic use of stimulants", instead I read "drug abuse", "inhaled"( there goes your insufflation contention), "toxicity", "wired", "severe- amphetamine abuse"...etc etc. so my contention that all of the articles are about drug abuse still holds. --<a href="../../../s/c/u/User%7EScuro_f2bf.html" title="User:Scuro">scuro</a> 03:42, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Citing scholarly sources does not an argument make. If you are going to go all "academic" about this, please be sure you know what you're doing. Using research on the effects of drug <b>abuse</b> in meth/amphetamine addicts to argue that bruxism is a side effect of low-level, therapeutic Adderall use gives your argument extremely poor <a href="../../../e/x/t/External_validity.html" title="External validity">external validity</a>.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Adopting your line of logic, I assert that having a daily glass of red wine (a low-level therapeutic intake of another substance with high potential abuse) comes with the common side effect of... seizures. Everyone knows <a href="../../../s/e/i/Seizures.html" title="Seizures">Seizures</a> and alcohol have a well-known link. Oh snap, and I have the citations to prove it:</dd>

<dd>Since it was hard to find studies that said "a daily glass of wine causes X, Y, or Z" besides health benefits, I found that using research on alcoholics served just as well. Ok, so those studies focused on a <i>completely different population</i> than casual wine drinkers, and I guess there *might* be a small, statistically insignificant difference in their alcohol consumption... whatev, same substance (sort of). The point remains that drinking *one serving* of red wine a day, for health benefits, can cause side effects such as seizures in some people. Since I even put my clever <i>scientific citations</i> in APA formatting, this must make my argument *extra* true. /sarcasm. I hope I've made my point. My Adderall makes research fun.</dd>

<dd>On a last note, there are plenty of articles that explicitly state "Adderall does X, Y, and Z", and they are quite easy to find if you have University access to e-journals. Literature is going to call is "mixed amphetamine salts", group it under the keyword "psychostimulants", or just simply call it "Adderall".
