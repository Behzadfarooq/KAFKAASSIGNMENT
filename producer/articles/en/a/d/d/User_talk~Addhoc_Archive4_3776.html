<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/d/User_talk%7EAddhoc_Archive4_3776.html" title="Edit section: Sockpuppetry">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Sockpuppetry</span></h2>
<p>This is in regard to <a href="../../../a/m/a/Wikipedia%7EAMA_Requests_for_Assistance_Requests_September_2006_Mu%C3%A9ro_810c.html" title="Wikipedia:AMA Requests for Assistance/Requests/September 2006/Muéro">my AMA request with which you're helping</a>. I'm sorry to post this here, but I would guess that Jaskaramdeep is watching edits to that page, and I wanted to make sure you got this message. Basically, I now know that he has engaged in sockpuppetry (one word or two?). He admitted to editing under the IP address 68.149.136.136 (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.149.136.136.html" title="User talk:68.149.136.136">read here</a>). There, he was also warned about removing messages on Jaskaramdeep's talk page (this was before anyone realized he <i>was</i> Jaskaramdeep). Recently, <a href="../../../6/8/2E/User%7E68.149.157.248.html" title="User:68.149.157.248">User:68.149.157.248</a> and Jaskaramdeep "outvoted" me about an issue on the <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonathan_Cheechoo_1ef9.html" title="Jonathan Cheechoo">Jonathan Cheechoo</a> page (Jaskaramdeep's edit summary was "2 vs 1. I believe you're outvoted, so please stop the revert war"). <a href="../../../6/8/2E/User%7E68.149.157.248.html" title="User:68.149.157.248">User:68.149.157.248</a> has recently been engaging in the same activity as Jaskaramdeep, like removing legitimate messages from talk pages and leaving uncivil comments. After checking the IP Info and WHOIS for <a href="../../../6/8/2E/User%7E68.149.157.248.html" title="User:68.149.157.248">User:68.149.157.248</a> and <a href="../../../6/8/2E/User%7E68.149.136.136.html" title="User:68.149.136.136">User:68.149.136.136</a>, it's obvious that those two are the same person, and therefore Jaskaramdeep, <a href="../../../6/8/2E/User%7E68.149.136.136.html" title="User:68.149.136.136">User:68.149.136.136</a>, and <a href="../../../6/8/2E/User%7E68.149.157.248.html" title="User:68.149.157.248">User:68.149.157.248</a> are all three the same editor. I understand that sometimes a person may forget to log in, but it's clear that Jaskaramdeep "voted" twice, by using sockpuppetry. What can be done about this? --<a href="../../../m/u/%C3%A9/User%7EMu%C3%A9ro_3824.html" title="User:Muéro">Muéro</a><sup>(<a href="../../../m/u/%C3%A9/User_talk%7EMu%C3%A9ro_9f40.html" title="User talk:Muéro">talk</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mu%C3%A9ro_f9f3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Muéro">c</a>)</sup> 04:40, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I completely agree, he is using his IP address as a sockpuppet. When he 'votes' using his sockpuppet, we should tag such comments as those of a suspected sock puppet. <a href="../../../a/d/d/User%7EAddhoc_21d7.html" title="User:Addhoc">Addhoc</a> 10:13, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am going to explain this very, very clearly, beacause you obviously didn't take the time to read my comment on the sockpuppet page. I admitted that <a href="../../../6/8/2E/User%7E68.149.157.248.html" title="User:68.149.157.248">User:68.149.157.248</a> and <a href="../../../6/8/2E/User%7E68.149.136.136.html" title="User:68.149.136.136">User:68.149.136.136</a> are me. My internet provider must have changed my IP address. I am <b>not</b> user:129.128.67.22. <b>user:129.128.67.22 has not made any comments on the Ales Hemsky talk page</b> as you lied about on the sockpuppetry page. I have made many comments on the Ales Hemsky talk page, using the username Jaskaramdeep, or my IP address. Now both you and Muero are falsifying information, and I am going to file a complaint unless you state your mistake on the sockpuppet page. Why user:129.128.67.22 from Edmonton, Alberta is making edits to a player page for Ales Hemsky of the Edmonton Oilers is anyone's guess. My guess is that as an Edmontonian, he/she follows the Oilers as do I. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJaskaramdeep_43c5.html" title="User:Jaskaramdeep">Jaskaramdeep</a> 20:19, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

In the longer term, you could set up either a merge proposal or list for deletion.Addhoc 20:03, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</i>. The user has deleted the cannabis reproduction article without (1)removing dispute tags, (2)without having a strawpoll, (3)without backing up a history of the discussion on the reproduction article which contained dispute tags. There where no proposals and the user is editing the work of others which has been cited before him. I think the user is uncivil and has abused mytalk page. Since the user does not want to reach consensus then there is nothing I can do but ask that you warn the user about <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a> and ask him to revert the changes they made and follow your advice this time.

<dd>Yeah just wanted to contribute to what you asked on my talk page. Pleased to meet you. I am sure the article will turn out well but there is some call for it to be less specialized than what it currently is. The reproduction section is almost the size of the remainder of the article. I believe, as others believe on the cannabis article talk page, that the layman should be able to use this article as an encyclopedia and read up on references for themselves. I tend to agree. What would be your position of creating specialized pages like the reproduction page again. This fork business is not exactly a consensus or warranted given the need to apply the KISS principles&#160;:) I hope you under. Thanks again. (Simonapro 09:05, 12 October 2006 (UTC))</dd>

<p>It appears that I have walked into the middle of a revert war wrt the inclusion of Alberto Fujimori in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_dictators.html" title="List of dictators">List of dictators</a> (which I only ran across in the course of RC patrol). Minimal searching seems to indicate that you mediated a previous conflict on this topic; was a conclusion reached? Including Fujimori in the list, without a solid scholarly reference, strikes me as contrary to WP:V and WP:NPoV; but YMMV. FWIW, I am unlikely to bother reverting it again if it is re-added by the same person; I will leave that to the usual suspects. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_K._Edwards_c2ba.html" title="User:Michael K.

<dd>I notice that you reopened the case of Alberto Fujimori. Unfortunately, I'm not going to participate and I already made that statement clear. Bdean on the other hand is in a pov pushing struggle with other IP's, and I don't want to participate in that either. Something is clear here: Bdean is attempting to use this page for propaganda purposes since he "claims to be a Humans Rights advocate". Maybe he is planning to attach this article with some Human Rights propaganda just as the letters asking contributions for some Central African country - I don't know. Nevertheless, I rather avoid any trouble here and I don't have the time to deal with people that are not willing to read a different opinion. Please remove my name from that mediation.</dd>

<dd>I'm shocked to see that some people believe that they should be treated with "royalties" just because they describe themselves as "Human Rights Advocates". Doesn't that states that they already have a political agenda?</dd>

<p>Since you have accepted the Kidman case it might be "helpful" to know that a resolution has, at least for the time being (there is no guarantee re: the future actions of other user named in the case in regard to apparent talk page consensus) has been reached based upon a paragraph you deleted at the Cabal page. It is the one that mentions that Wiki precedent for this type of article establishes naming countries of citizenship, e.g. for Kidman "Australian-American", and not one or the other. I realize that Wiki precedent may not be policy, so this may not be valid and you can delete this also as nonsense if you so desire. I thought the mention in the Cabal case was helpful, and relevant per Kidman talk page discussion. A definitive comment in regard to this proposed precedent would be helpful, rather than deleted and ignored.

It is improper for you to remove another mediator's advice when it does not breach wikipedia policy. The rest of the material you removed (even if by mistake) obviously was useful to resolve the case, so I hope this incident makes you think twice about deleting things from mediation pages in the future. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkovich292_9f23.html" title="User:Markovich292"><font color="green"><b>Markovich292</b></font></a> 23:09, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And you were not the mediator at the time either. I was thinking about taking it up (which is why I responded in the mediator response section...), although I found that an RfC had not been filed. Often times an RfC will have the effect of bringing another perspective to the issue that pushes it in a good direction, or even solves the disagreement immediately. I don't see why you would call that absurd (especially when RfCs are listed in <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResolving_disputes_9a93.html" title="Wikipedia:Resolving disputes">Wikipedia:Resolving disputes</a> as "the main avenue for general disputes"). <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkovich292_9f23.html" title="User:Markovich292"><font color="green"><b>Markovich292</b></font></a> 05:32, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Addhoc. Both of these warnings for incivility were put by you but I have not mentioned you so I dont see your problem.I have simply asked people to stop vandalising the LTTE article. unilaterally deleting a referenced section from an article in spite of the objections of the other users is definitely vandalism.

<p>Constructive comments like these are needed to actually make the article better. I'll get down to both the tasks of enclyclopedic language and the background of Hinduism once the AfD is over. Would you please remove the template? The template may be misused by User:Green23. Given his history of vandal attempts he may use it for detaching Buddhism from it's Dharmic roots and attempt original research on the article. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreedom_skies_2507.html" title="User:Freedom skies">Freedom skies</a> 16:16, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you. I'm working on both enclyclopedic language and the background of Hinduism on my sandbox. It should be ready in less than two days. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreedom_skies_2507.html" title="User:Freedom skies">Freedom skies</a> 17:20, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would like to know what is the best procedure to stop a vandal which is using different Ips from the 136.159.x.x ip range? This person has racial issues /opinions and makes changes with insults. Is there any way to give permission to certain users to edit a page in this case (Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University) to avoid this kind of vandalism?
