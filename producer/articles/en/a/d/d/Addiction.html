<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/d/Addiction.html" title="Edit section: Terminology and usage">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Terminology and usage</span></h2>
<p>Decades ago addiction was a pharmacologic term that clearly referred to the use of a tolerance-inducing drug in sufficient quantity as to cause tolerance (the requirement that greater dosages of a given drug be used to produce an identical effect as time passes). With that definition, humans (and indeed all mammals) can become addicted to various drugs quickly. Almost at the same time, a lay definition of addiction developed. This definition referred to individuals who continued to use a given drug despite their own best interest. This latter definition is now thought of as a disease state by the medical community.</p>
<p>Physical dependence, abuse of, and withdrawal from drugs and other miscellaneous substances is outlined in the <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders_5c59.html" title="Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</a> (DSM-IV TR). Unfortunately, terminology has become quite complicated in the field. To wit, pharmacologists continue to speak of addiction from a physiologic standpoint (some call this a physical dependence); psychiatrists refer to the disease state as dependence; most other physicians refer to the disease as addiction. The field of psychiatry is now considering, as they move from DSM-IV to DSM-V, transitioning from "dependence" to "addiction" as terminology for the disease state.</p>
<p>The medical community now makes a careful theoretical distinction between <i>physical dependence</i> (characterized by symptoms of <a href="../../../w/i/t/Withdrawal.html" title="Withdrawal">withdrawal</a>) and <i>psychological dependence</i> (or simply <i>addiction</i>). Addiction is now narrowly defined as "uncontrolled, compulsive use"; if there is no harm being suffered by, or damage done to, the patient or another party, then clinically it may be considered compulsive, but to the definition of some it is not categorized as "addiction". In practice, the two kinds of addiction are not always easy to distinguish. Addictions often have both physical and psychological components.</p>
<p>There is also a lesser known situation called pseudo-addiction.{(Weissman and Haddox, 1989}} A patient will exhibit drug-seeking behavior reminiscent of psychological addiction, but they tend to have genuine pain or other symptoms that have been undertreated. Unlike true psychological addiction, these behaviors tend to stop when the pain is adequately treated.</p>
<p>The obsolete term <i>physical addiction</i> is deprecated, because of its connotations. In modern pain management with opioids physical dependence is nearly universal but addiction is rare.</p>
<p>Not all doctors agree on what addiction or dependency is, because traditionally, addiction has been defined as being possible only to a psychoactive substance (for example <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcoholism.html" title="Alcoholism">alcohol</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/b/Tobacco_smoking.html" title="Tobacco smoking">tobacco</a>, or <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drug_addiction.html" title="Drug addiction">drugs</a>), which is ingested, crosses the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood-brain_barrier.html" title="Blood-brain barrier">blood-brain barrier</a>, and alters the natural chemical behavior of the brain temporarily. Many people, both psychology professionals and laypersons, now feel that there should be accommodation made to include psychological dependency on such things as <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gambling.html" title="Gambling">gambling</a>, <a href="../../../o/v/e/Overeating.html" title="Overeating">food</a>, <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypersexuality.html" title="Hypersexuality">sex</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/r/Pornography_addiction.html" title="Pornography addiction">pornography</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_addiction.html" title="Computer addiction">computers</a>, <a href="../../../w/o/r/Workaholic.html" title="Workaholic">work</a>, exercise, cutting, and <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shopping.html" title="Shopping">shopping</a> / spending. However, these are things or tasks which, when used or performed, cannot cross the blood-brain barrier and hence, do not fit into the traditional view of addiction. Symptoms mimicking <a href="../../../w/i/t/Withdrawal.html" title="Withdrawal">withdrawal</a> may occur with abatement of such behaviors; however, it is said by those who adhere to a traditionalist view that these withdrawal-like symptoms are not strictly reflective of an addiction, but rather of a behavioral disorder. In spite of traditionalist protests and warnings that overextension of definitions may cause the wrong treatment to be used (thus failing the person with the behavioral problem), popular media, and some members of the field, do represent the aforementioned behavioral examples as addictions.</p>
<p>In the contemporary view, the trend is to acknowledge the possibility that the <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypothalmus.html" title="Hypothalmus">hypothalmus</a> creates <a href="../../../p/e/p/Peptides.html" title="Peptides">peptides</a> in the brain that equal and/or exceed the effect of externally applied chemicals (<a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcohol.html" title="Alcohol">alcohol</a>, <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicotine.html" title="Nicotine">nicotine</a> etc.) when addictive activities take place<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. For example, when an addicted gambler or shopper is satisfying their craving, chemicals called <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endorphins.html" title="Endorphins">endorphins</a> are produced and released within the brain, reinforcing the individual's positive associations with their behavior.</p>
<p>Despite the popularity of defining addiction in medical terms, recently many have proposed defining addiction in terms of <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economics.html" title="Economics">Economics</a>, such as calculating the <a href="../../../e/l/a/Elasticity_%28economics%29.html" title="Elasticity (economics)">elasticity</a> of addictive goods and determining, to what extent, present <a href="../../../i/n/c/Income.html" title="Income">income</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consumption_%28economics%29.html" title="Consumption (economics)">consumption (economics)</a> has on future consumption.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> …</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/d/Addiction.html" title="Edit section: Physical dependency">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Physical dependency</span></h3>
<p><i><a href="../../../p/h/y/Physical_dependence.html" title="Physical dependence">Physical dependence</a></i> on a substance is defined by the appearance of characteristic <a href="../../../w/i/t/Withdrawal.html" title="Withdrawal">withdrawal</a> symptoms when the substance or behavior is suddenly discontinued. While opioids, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, alcohol and nicotine are all well known for their ability to induce physical dependence, other categories of substances share this property and are not considered addictive: <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cortisone.html" title="Cortisone">cortisone</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/t/Beta-blockers.html" title="Beta-blockers">beta-blockers</a> and most antidepressants are examples. So, while physical dependency can be a major factor in the psychology of addiction and most often becomes a primary motivator in the continuation of an addiction, the primary attribute of an addictive substance is usually its ability to induce pleasure<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> and its facility in becoming routinely used. A notable exception to this is <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicotine.html" title="Nicotine">nicotine</a>. Users report that a cigarette can be pleasurable, but there is a medical consensus<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> that the user is likely fulfilling his/her physical addiction and, therefore, is achieving pleasurable feelings relative to his/her previous state of physical withdrawal. Further, the physical dependency of the nicotine addict on the substance itself becomes an overwhelming factor in the continuation of most users' addictions. Although 35 million smokers make an attempt to quit every year, fewer than 7% achieve even one year of abstinence (from the NIDA research report on nicotine addiction).<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Some substances induce physical dependence or <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physiological_tolerance.html" title="Physiological tolerance">physiological tolerance</a> - but not addiction - for example many <a href="../../../l/a/x/Laxative.html" title="Laxative">laxatives</a>, which are not psychoactive; nasal <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decongestants.html" title="Decongestants">decongestants</a>, which can cause rebound congestion if used for more than a few days in a row; and some <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antidepressants.html" title="Antidepressants">antidepressants</a>, most notably <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venlafaxine.html" title="Venlafaxine">venlafaxine</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paroxetine.html" title="Paroxetine">paroxetine</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sertraline.html" title="Sertraline">sertraline</a>, as they have quite short <a href="../../../h/a/l/Half-lives.html" title="Half-lives">half-lives</a>, so stopping them abruptly causes a more rapid change in the neurotransmitter balance in the brain than many other antidepressants. Many non-addictive prescription drugs should not be suddenly stopped, so a doctor should be consulted before abruptly discontinuing them.</p>
<p>The speed with which a given individual becomes addicted to various substances varies with the substance, the frequency of use, the means of ingestion, the intensity of pleasure or euphoria, and the individual's genetic and psychological susceptibility. Some <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcoholic.html" title="Alcoholic">alcoholics</a> report they exhibited alcoholic tendencies from the moment of first intoxication, while most people can drink socially without ever becoming addicted. Studies<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> have demonstrated that opioid dependent individuals have different responses to even low doses of opioids than the majority of people, although this may be due to a variety of other factors, as opioid use heavily stimulates pleasure-inducing neurotransmitters in the brain. The vast majority of medical professionals and scientists agree that if one uses strong opioids on a regular basis for even just a short period of time, one will most likely become physically dependent<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. Nonetheless, because of these variations, in addition to the adoption and twin studies that have been well replicated, much of the medical community is satisfied that addiction is in part genetically moderated. That is, one's genetic makeup may regulate how susceptible one is to a substance and how easily one may become psychologically attached to a pleasurable routine.</p>
<p><a href="../../../e/a/t/Eating_disorders.html" title="Eating disorders">Eating disorders</a> are complicated pathological mental illnesses and thus are not the same as addictions described in this article. Eating disorders, which some argue are not addictions at all, are driven by a multitude of factors, most of which are highly different than the factors behind addictions described in this article.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/d/Addiction.html" title="Edit section: Psychological dependency">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Psychological dependency</span></h3>
<p><b>Psychological dependency</b> is a dependency of the mind, and lead to psychological withdrawal symptoms (such as <a href="../../../c/r/a/Cravings.html" title="Cravings">cravings</a>, <a href="../../../i/r/r/Irritability.html" title="Irritability">irritability</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insomnia.html" title="Insomnia">insomnia</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/p/Depression_%28mood%29.html" title="Depression (mood)">depression</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anorexia_%28symptom%29.html" title="Anorexia (symptom)">anorexia</a> etc). Addiction can theoretically form for any rewarding behavior, and is believed to be strongly associated with the <a href="../../../d/o/p/Dopaminergic_system.html" title="Dopaminergic system">dopaminergic system</a> of the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brain.html" title="Brain">brain</a>'s <a href="../../../r/e/w/Reward_system.html" title="Reward system">reward system</a> (as in the case of <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cocaine.html" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a> and <a href="../../../a/m/p/Amphetamines.html" title="Amphetamines">amphetamines</a>). Some claim that it is caused as a <a href="../../../h/a/b/Habituation.html" title="Habituation">habitual</a> means to avoid undesired activity, but typically it is only done so to a clinical level in individuals who have emotional, social, or <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mental_illness.html" title="Mental illness">psychological dysfunctions</a>, taking the place of normal positive stimuli not otherwise attained (see <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rat_Park_9216.html" title="Rat Park">Rat Park</a>).</p>
<p>It is considered possible to be both psychologically and physically dependent at the same time. Some doctors make little distinction between the two types of addiction, for the result, <a href="../../../s/u/b/Substance_abuse.html" title="Substance abuse">substance abuse</a>, is the same. However, the cause of the addiction in either case is quite different, as is the type of treatment preferred.</p>
<p>Psychological dependence does not have to be limited only to substances; even various activities and behavioral patterns may be considered addictions if they are harmful, e.g. <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gambling.html" title="Gambling">gambling</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_addiction.html" title="Internet addiction">Internet use</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_addiction.html" title="Computer addiction">usage of computers</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_addiction.html" title="Sexual addiction">sex</a> / <a href="../../../p/o/r/Pornography_addiction.html" title="Pornography addiction">pornography</a>, <a href="../../../e/a/t/Eating_disorder.html" title="Eating disorder">eating</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-harm.html" title="Self-harm">self-harm</a> or <a href="../../../w/o/r/Workaholic.html" title="Workaholic">work</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Addiction_and_drug_control_legislation" id="Addiction_and_drug_control_legislation"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/d/Addiction.html" title="Edit section: Addiction and drug control legislation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Addiction and drug control legislation</span></h2>
<p>Most countries have legislation which brings various drugs and drug-like <a href="../../../s/u/b/Substance.html" title="Substance">substances</a> under the control of licensing systems. Typically this legislation covers any or all of the opiates, <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methamphetamines.html" title="Methamphetamines">methamphetamines</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannabinoids.html" title="Cannabinoids">cannabinoids</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cocaine.html" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbiturate.html" title="Barbiturate">barbiturates</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hallucinogen.html" title="Hallucinogen">hallucinogens</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/y/Tryptamines.html" title="Tryptamines">tryptamines</a>, <a href="../../../l/s/d/LSD_cccf.html" title="LSD">LSD</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/e/Phencyclidine.html" title="Phencyclidine">phencyclidine</a>(<a href="../../../p/c/p/PCP_1185.html" title="PCP">PCP</a>), <a href="../../../p/s/i/Psilocybin.html" title="Psilocybin">psilocybin</a>) and a variety of more modern synthetic drugs, and unlicensed production, supply or possession is a criminal offense.</p>
<p>Usually, however, drug classification under such legislation is not related simply to addictiveness. The substances covered often have very different addictive properties. Some are highly prone to cause physical dependency, whilst others rarely cause any form of compulsive need whatsoever. Typically nicotine (in the form of tobacco) is regulated extremely loosely, if at all, although it is well-known as one of the most addictive substances ever discovered.</p>
<p>Also, although the legislation may be justifiable on moral grounds to some, it can make addiction or dependency a much more serious issue for the individual. Reliable supplies of a drug become difficult to secure as illegally produced substances may have contaminants. The withdrawal from the substances or the contaminants can cause additional health issues and the individual becomes vulnerable to both criminal abuse and legal punishment. Criminal elements that can be involved in the profitable trade of such substances can also cause physical harm to users in some cases.</p>
<p>A simpler explanation is that people take pain relievers to relieve their pain. The pain can come from PTSD inducing experiences like being in a war zone, child abuse and child sexual abuse, and other similar trauma.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/d/Addiction.html" title="Edit section: Methods of care">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Methods of care</span></h2>
<p>Early editions of the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Psychiatric_Association_f5df.html" title="American Psychiatric Association">American Psychiatric Association's</a> <i><a href="../../../d/i/a/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders_5c59.html" title="Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</a></i> (DSM) described addiction as a physical dependency to a substance that resulted in withdrawal symptoms in its absence. Recent editions, including DSM-IV, have moved toward a diagnostic instrument that classifies such conditions as dependency, rather than addiction. The <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Society_of_Addiction_Medicine_1df7.html" title="American Society of Addiction Medicine">American Society of Addiction Medicine</a> recommends treatment for people with chemical dependency based on patient placement criteria (currently listed in PPC-2), which attempt to match levels of care according to clinical assessments in six areas, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acute intoxication and/or <a href="../../../w/i/t/Withdrawal.html" title="Withdrawal">withdrawal</a> potential</li>
<li>Biomedical conditions or complications</li>
<li>Emotional/behavioral conditions or complications</li>
<li>Treatment acceptance/resistance</li>
<li><a href="../../../r/e/l/Relapse.html" title="Relapse">Relapse</a> potential</li>
<li>Recovery environment</li>
</ul>
<p>Some medical systems, including those of at least 15 states of the United States, refer to an Addiction Severity Index to assess the severity of problems related to substance use. The index assesses problems in six areas: medical, employment/support, alcohol and other drug use, legal, family/social, and psychiatric.</p>
<p>While addiction or dependency is related to seemingly uncontrollable urges, and has roots in genetic predisposition, treatment of dependency is conducted by a wide range of medical and allied professionals, including <a href="../../../a/d/d/Addiction_Medicine_0e4c.html" title="Addiction Medicine">Addiction Medicine</a> specialists, psychiatrists, and appropriately trained nurses, social workers, and counselors. Early treatment of acute withdrawal often includes medical <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detoxification.html" title="Detoxification">detoxification</a>, which can include doses of <a href="../../../a/n/x/Anxiolytic.html" title="Anxiolytic">anxiolytics</a> or narcotics to reduce symptoms of withdrawal. An experimental drug, <a href="../../../i/b/o/Ibogaine.html" title="Ibogaine">ibogaine</a>, is also proposed to treat withdrawal and craving. Alternatives to medical detoxification include <a href="../../../a/c/u/Acupuncture_detoxification.html" title="Acupuncture detoxification">acupuncture detoxification</a>. In chronic opiate addiction, a surrogate drug such as <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methadone.html" title="Methadone">methadone</a> is sometimes offered as a form of <a href="../../../o/p/i/Opiate_replacement_therapy.html" title="Opiate replacement therapy">opiate replacement therapy</a>. But treatment approaches universal focus on the individual's ultimate choice to pursue an alternate course of action.</p>
<p>Therapists often classify patients with chemical dependencies as either interested or not interested in changing. Treatments usually involve planning for specific ways to avoid the addictive stimulus, and therapeutic interventions intended to help a client learn healthier ways to find satisfaction. Clinical leaders in recent years have attempted to tailor intervention approaches to specific influences that effect addictive behavior, using therapeutic interviews in an effort to discover factors that led a person to embrace unhealthy, addictive sources of pleasure or relief from pain.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/d/Addiction.html" title="Edit section: Diverse explanations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Diverse explanations</span></h2>
<p>Several explanations (or "models") have been presented to explain addiction:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <i><a href="../../../m/o/r/Moral.html" title="Moral">moral</a> model</i> states that addictions are the result of human weakness, and are defects of <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moral_character.html" title="Moral character">character</a>. Those who advance this model do not accept that there is any biological basis for addiction. They often have scant sympathy for people with serious addictions, believing either that a person with greater moral strength could have the force of will to break an addiction, or that the addict demonstrated a great moral failure in the first place by starting the addiction. The moral model is widely applied to dependency on illegal substances, perhaps purely for social or political reasons, but is no longer widely considered to have any therapeutic value. Elements of the moral model, especially a focus on individual choices, have found enduring roles in other approaches to the treatment of dependencies.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The <i><a href="../../../o/p/p/Opponent-process.html" title="Opponent-process">opponent-process</a> model</i> generated by Richard Soloman states that for every psychological event A will be followed by its opposite psychological event B. For example, the pleasure one experiences from heroin is followed by an opponent process of withdrawal, or the terror of jumping out of an airplane is rewarded with intense pleasure when the parachute opens. This model is related to the opponent process color theory. If you look at the color red then quickly look at a gray area you will see green. There are many examples of opponent processes in the nervous system including taste, motor movement, touch, vision, and hearing. Opponent-processes occurring at the sensory level may translate "down-stream" into addictive or habit-forming behavior.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The <i>allostatic(stability through change) model</i> generated by <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Koob_2944.html" title="George Koob">George Koob</a> and Michel LeMoal is a modification of the opponent process theory where continued use of a drug leads to a spiralling of uncontrolled use, negative emotional states and withdrawal and a shift into use to new allostatic set point which is lower than that maintained before use of the drug (Koob and LeMoal, 2001; Koob and LeMoal, 2006).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The <i><a href="../../../d/i/s/Disease_model_of_addiction.html" title="Disease model of addiction">disease model of addiction</a></i> holds that addiction is a <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disease.html" title="Disease">disease</a>, coming about as a result of either the impairment of <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neurochemistry.html" title="Neurochemistry">neurochemical</a> or behavioral processes, or of some combination of the two. Within this model, addictive disease is treated by specialists in <a href="../../../a/d/d/Addiction_Medicine_0e4c.html" title="Addiction Medicine">Addiction Medicine</a>. Within the field of medicine, the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Medical_Association_5470.html" title="American Medical Association">American Medical Association</a>, National Association of Social Workers, and American Psychological Association all have policy as to addictive processes representing a disease state. While there is some dispute among clinicians as to the reliability of this model, it is widely employed in therapeutic settings. Most treatment approaches involve recognition that dependencies are behavioral dysfunctions, and thus involve some element of physical or mental disease. Critics like <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanton_Peele_5abf.html" title="Stanton Peele">Stanton Peele</a> describe an absence of medical evidence for an implied physiological process (beyond that of simple mood state changes) that can be equated with the disease of addiction. Organizations such as the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Society_of_Addiction_Medicine_1df7.html" title="American Society of Addiction Medicine">American Society of Addiction Medicine</a> believe the research-based evidence for addiction's status as a disease is overwhelming.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The <i><a href="../../../g/e/n/Genetics.html" title="Genetics">genetic</a> model</i> posits a genetic predisposition to certain behaviors. It is frequently noted that certain addictions "run in the family," and while researchers continue to explore the extent of genetic influence, there is strong evidence that genetic predisposition is often a factor in dependency.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The <i><a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture.html" title="Culture">cultural</a> model</i> recognizes that the influence of culture is a strong determinant of whether or not individuals fall prey to certain addictions. For example, alcoholism is rare among <a href="../../../s/a/u/Saudi_Arabia_53d2.html" title="Saudi Arabia">Saudi Arabians</a>, where obtaining alcohol is difficult and using alcohol is prohibited. In North America, on the other hand, the incidence of <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gambling.html" title="Gambling">gambling</a> addictions soared in the last two decades of the <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a>, mirroring the growth of the gaming industry. Half of all patients diagnosed as alcoholic are born into families where alcohol is used heavily, suggesting that familiar influence, genetic factors, or more likely both, play a role in the development of addiction. What also needs to be noted is that when people don't gain a sense of moderation through their development they can be just as likely, if not more, to abuse substances than people born into alcoholic families.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The <i>blended model</i> attempts to consider elements of all other models in developing a therapeutic approach to dependency. It holds that the mechanism of dependency is different for different individuals, and that each case must be considered on its own merits.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The <i><a href="../../../h/a/b/Habituation.html" title="Habituation">habit</a> model</i> proposed by <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Szasz_eb3d.html" title="Thomas Szasz">Thomas Szasz</a> questions the very concept of "addiction." He argues that addiction is a metaphor, and that the only reason to make the distinction between habit and addiction "is to persecute somebody." <a href="http://www.szasz.com/drugsandfreedom1973.html" class="external text" title="http://www.szasz.com/drugsandfreedom1973.html" rel="nofollow">(Szasz, 1973)</a></li>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/d/Addiction.html" title="Edit section: Neurobiological basis">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Neurobiological basis</span></h2>
<p>The development of addiction is thought to involve a simultaneous process of 1) increased focus on and engagement in a particular behavior and 2) the attenuation or "shutting down" of other behaviors. For example, under certain experimental circumstances such as social deprivation and boredom, animals allowed the unlimited ability to self-administer certain psychoactive drugs will show such a strong preference that they will forgo food, sleep, and sex for continued access. The neuro-anatomical correlate of this is that the brain regions involved in driving goal-directed behavior grow increasingly selective for particular motivating stimuli and rewards, to the point that the brain regions involved in the inhibition of behavior can no longer effectively send "stop" signals. A good analogy is to imagine flooring the gas pedal in a car with very bad brakes. In this case, the limbic system is thought to be the major "driving force" and the orbitofrontal cortex is the substrate of the top-down inhibition.</p>
<p>A specific portion of the limbic circuit known as the <a href="../../../m/e/s/Mesolimbic_pathway.html" title="Mesolimbic pathway">mesolimbic</a> dopaminergic system is hypothesized to play an important role in translation of motivation to motor behavior- and reward-related learning in particular. It is typically defined as the <a href="../../../v/e/n/Ventral_tegmental_area.html" title="Ventral tegmental area">ventral tegmental area</a> (VTA), the nucleus accumbens, and the bundle of <a href="../../../d/o/p/Dopamine.html" title="Dopamine">dopamine</a>-containing fibers that are connecting them. This system is commonly implicated in the seeking out and consumption of rewarding stimuli or events, such as sweet-tasting foods or sexual interaction. However, its importance to addiction research goes beyond its role in "natural" motivation: while the specific site or mechanism of action may differ, all known drugs of abuse have the common effect in that they elevate the level of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens. This may happen directly, such as through blockade of the dopamine re-uptake mechanism (see <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cocaine.html" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a>). It may also happen indirectly, such as through stimulation of the dopamine-containing neurons of the VTA that synapse onto neurons in the accumbens (see <a href="../../../o/p/i/Opiates.html" title="Opiates">opiates</a>). The euphoric effects of drugs of abuse are thought to be a direct result of the acute increase in accumbal dopamine.</p>
<p>The human body has a natural tendency to maintain <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homeostasis.html" title="Homeostasis">homeostasis</a>, and the central nervous system is no exception. Chronic elevation of dopamine will result in a decrease in the number of dopamine <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transmembrane_receptor.html" title="Transmembrane receptor">receptors</a> available in a process known as <a href="../../../d/o/w/Downregulation.html" title="Downregulation">downregulation</a>. The decreased number of receptors changes the permeability of the cell membrane located post-synaptically, such that the post-synaptic neuron is less excitable- i.e.: less able to respond to chemical signaling with an electrical impulse, or <a href="../../../a/c/t/Action_potential.html" title="Action potential">action potential</a>. It is hypothesized that this dulling of the responsiveness of the brain's reward pathways contributes to the inability to feel pleasure, known as <a href="../../../a/n/h/Anhedonia.html" title="Anhedonia">anhedonia</a>, often observed in addicts. The increased requirement for dopamine to maintain the same electrical activity is the basis of both <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physiological_tolerance.html" title="Physiological tolerance">physiological tolerance</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/t/Withdrawal.html" title="Withdrawal">withdrawal</a> associated with addiction.</p>
<p>Downregulation can be classically conditioned. If a behavior consistently occurs in the same environment or contingently with a particular cue, the brain will adjust to the presence of the conditioned cues by decreasing the number of available receptors in the absence of the behavior. It is thought that many drug overdoses are not the result of a user taking a higher dose than is typical, but rather that the user is administering the same dose in a new environment.</p>
<p>In cases of physical dependency on <a href="../../../d/e/p/Depressant.html" title="Depressant">depressants</a> of the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_nervous_system.html" title="Central nervous system">central nervous system</a> such as opioids, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbiturate.html" title="Barbiturate">barbiturates</a>, or alcohol, the absence of the substance can lead to symptoms of severe physical discomfort. Withdrawal from alcohol or sedatives such as barbiturates or benzodiazepines (valium-family) can result in seizures and even death. By contrast, withdrawal from opioids, which can be extremely uncomfortable, is rarely if ever life-threatening. In cases of dependence and withdrawal, the body has become so dependent on high concentrations of the particular chemical that it has stopped producing its own natural versions (endogenous ligands) and instead produces opposing chemicals. When the addictive substance is withdrawn, the effects of the opposing chemicals can become overwhelming. For example, chronic use of sedatives (alcohol, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbiturate.html" title="Barbiturate">barbiturates</a>, or benzodiazepines) results in higher chronic levels of stimulating <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neurotransmitter.html" title="Neurotransmitter">neurotransmitters</a> such as glutamate. Very high levels of glutamate kill nerve cells, a phenomenon called excitatory neurotoxicity.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/d/Addiction.html" title="Edit section: Criticism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Criticism</span></h2>
<p>Levi Bryant has criticized the term and concept of <i>addiction</i> as counterproductive in psychotherapy as it defines a patient's identity and makes it harder to become a <i>non-addict</i>. "The signifier 'addict' doesn't simply describe what I am, but initiates a way of relating to myself that informs how I relate to others."</p>
<p>A stronger form of criticism comes from <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Szasz_eb3d.html" title="Thomas Szasz">Thomas Szasz</a>, who denies that addiction is a psychiatric problem. In many of his works, he argues that addiction is a choice, and that a drug addict is one who simply prefers a socially taboo substance rather than, say, a low risk lifestyle. In 'Our Right to Drugs', Szasz cites the biography of <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malcolm_X_92fd.html" title="Malcolm X">Malcolm X</a> to corroborate his economic views towards addiction: Malcolm claimed that quitting cigarettes was harder than shaking his heroin addiction. Szasz postulates that humans always have a choice, and it is foolish to call someone an 'addict' just because they prefer a <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drug.html" title="Drug">drug</a> induced <a href="../../../h/a/p/Happiness.html" title="Happiness">euphoria</a> to a more popular and socially welcome lifestyle.</p>
<p>Therefore, being 'addicted' to a substance is no different from being 'addicted' to a job that you work everyday. It should be noted that Szasz and Bryant are not alone in questioning the standard view of addiction. Professor John Booth Davies at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Strathclyde_d765.html" title="University of Strathclyde">University of Strathclyde</a> has argued in his book <i>The Myth of Addiction</i> that 'people take drugs because they want to and because it makes sense for them to do so given the choices available' as opposed to the view that 'they are compelled to by the pharmacology of the drugs they take'. <a href="http://www.druglibrary.org/special/davies/mythprologue.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.druglibrary.org/special/davies/mythprologue.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. He uses an adaption of <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attribution_theory.html" title="Attribution theory">attribution theory</a> (what he calls the theory of functional attributions) to argue that the statement 'I am addicted to drugs' is functional, rather than veridical. <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanton_Peele_5abf.html" title="Stanton Peele">Stanton Peele</a> has put forward similar views.</p>
<p>Experimentally, Bruce K. Alexander used the classic experiment of <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rat_Park_9216.html" title="Rat Park">Rat Park</a> to show that 'addicted' behaviour in rats only occurred when the rats had no other options. When other options and behavioural opportunities were put in place, the rats soon showed far more complex behaviours.</p>
