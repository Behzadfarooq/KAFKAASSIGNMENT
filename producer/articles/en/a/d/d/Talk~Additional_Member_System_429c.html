	    <p>Henrygb, can you please justify this recent change in the definition of AMS? It might be nice if AMS and MMP meant different things, but AFAIK that's simply not true, I have always been under the impression that when someone in Scotland says 'AMS' they are referring to the original definition ie: equivalent to MMP.</p>
<p>Even if the definition of AMS is to be changed, it would be better if the old page was moved to MMP rather than being edited in place, ie: change the title, not the content. As it stands most of its content is still specific to MMP, and the MMP branch has lost its history and much of its content.</p>

<dd>The point is that AMS on the face of it means each voter having two votes in elections (using two systems) where the members in the second election are <i>additional</i> to those in the first. That is the position in Scotland, Germany etc. But it is also the position in Russia, Japan etc. Indeed the inclusion of Japan in the list of countries on the AMS page, when it has a parallel system is an indication of the confusion. I do not see that parallel voting systems are any less AMS than mixed member proportional systems are AMS; parallel and MMP should each be seen as subsets of AMS. Google is likely to be biased to the worldwide examples that English speakers are familiar with. That being said, I don't want to get into a revert war, so I have added a paragraph trying to explain the difference. Henrygb 29 Jan 2004</dd>

<dd>Since the issue may have arisen again (see below) here's my late reply. Unfortunately what AMS or any other term means "on the face of it" doens't matter. Many voting systems have less than ideal names (What does "alternative vote" tell you for example!) but meanings are defined by common usage.

<p>Re Japan and Macedonia.

<dd>But it is clear that several people regard "Additional Member System" as meaning two elections (or at least two counts), one less proportional and one more proportional to provide "additional members". The question of whether it requires the proportional part to take account of the non-proportional part is, in my view open as "common usage". For the sake of clarity, I still think that AMS should be the general term, pointing to "Parallel voting" and "Mixed member proportional voting" as specific terms. Germany and others would still be AMS, but they would also be MMP. --<a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenrygb_9b92.html" title="User:Henrygb">Henrygb</a> 20:25, 12 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, though it does not explicitly use AMS to describe New Zealand, but instead MMP (even if it does say similar to Germany).

<p>I've deleted this text: <b>and in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> the other parties get compensatory seats to obtain the proportionality.</b></p>
<p>It's simply a big lie... uh... mistake. I've read the Electoral Act before (it's online if you want to check it) and the Electoral Commission website confirms my understanding <a href="http://www.elections.org.nz/esyst/govt_elect.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.elections.org.nz/esyst/govt_elect.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. In New Zealand, you just keep your overhang seats, no compensation for the other parties. I'd love to know where that idea came from though.</p>
<p>There is another quirk in the New Zealand system, the number of seats that are allocated proportionally can be less than 120, if some of the constituency seats have been won by people who were independent or effectively independent (their party didn't stand a list). Say there were 5 independents, then 115 seats would be allocated to parties proportionally. This means that independents do not cause an overhang. You only get overhang if a real party wins more constituency seats that it would have been otherwise entitled to.</p>
<p>This is all academic (so far) because we have never had an independent elected, and never had an overhang, although it's conceivable that the Maori Party may overhang at the election next year.</p>
<p>Another piece of speculation just occurred to me. There's a grubby piece of legislation called the Electoral Integrity Act, whereby a rebellious MP can be kicked out of parliament if they "interfere with the proportionality of Parliament" (or wording to that effect). The idea is if you leave your party you have to continue to vote along with your party or they can have you expelled. Constitutionally dubious, but the drafters of the bill must have known that, because they build a sunset clause into it. Anyway... if a party was in overhang, presumably their rebels would be free to leave, because their party had too many MPs anyway.</p>
<p>Sorry this is way off-topic, I got carried away.</p>

<p>I cut out most of "<i>It needs be considered that this problem has never occurred in most countries using AMS, where the candidates must generally be part of a readily identifiable party. In theory, it would be possible by setting up two separate parties, one to run a list and one to run in electorates, but as these parties would have to be incorporated separately, there is strong potential that divisions between the two parties could prevent any fruitful cooperation. Alternatively, the electorates could be run by indepedent candidates, 'appointed' by the party with the list, however yet again the party will have no control over the indepedent electoral candidates. Both concepts also risk alienating voters.</i>" and replaced it with "<i>Decoy lists are not used in most countries using AMS, where most voters vote for candidates from parties with long-standing names.</i>" The rest is in my view a POV apologetic analysis. If there is evidence of an attempt to do this elsewhere which went wrong then it should be included. Other speculation as <i>what might happen if ...</i> is unencyclopedic. One maight as well say that only Italian voters are clever enough to respond to decoy lists. What is interesting is that the Italian version of AMS required the list candidates to be defeated constituency candidates with the same party label - i.e. a protection against decoy lists, but it did not work. --<a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenrygb_9b92.html" title="User:Henrygb">Henrygb</a> 00:06, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>And now I have cut out "<i>Most other countries using AMS have stricter laws regarding party membership and/or the formation of political groups. In Germany, for example, neither membership in different parties at the same time nor <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_list.html" title="Open list">open lists</a> (i.e. voting lists open to members of different parties or groups that intend to form a political alliance) are legal. These measures also serve to keep small parties from circumventing the 5% threshold. Thus decoy lists are virtually impossible.</i>". Presumably this is really trying to say that you cannot be a constituency candidate for one party and a list candidate for another party; but that is also true in Italy. I would like to see evidence of any AMS country where the state prohibits simple membership of more than one party if the parties allow it. The articles on <a href="../../../l/e/f/Left_Party_%28Germany%29_33c6.html" title="Left Party (Germany)">Left Party (Germany)</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_and_Social_Justice_Party_6a4f.html" title="Labour and Social Justice Party">Labour and Social Justice Party</a> suggest that alliances are possible.

The only way to stop them is to unify the constituency and the party vote into a single vote (in effect also requiring each party to stand in each constituency). --<a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenrygb_9b92.html" title="User:Henrygb">Henrygb</a> 21:51, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>There should also be consideration to moving it to Additional Member Systems (system<b>s</b> instead of system). This article is really describing two rather different electoral systems.

<p>If AMS is restricted to cases where "the aim is for the party's total number of representatives, including constituency representatives, to be proportional to its percentage of the party vote" then the UK needs to be removed from the list of places using AMS. The article states:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>On the district or national level (i.e. above the constituency level), the total number of seats in the assembly are allocated to parties proportionally to the number of votes the party received in the party portion of the ballot. Subtracted from each party's allocation is the number of constituency seats that party won. The number of seats remaining allocated to that party are filled using the party's list.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>That is not AMS in the UK, which reverses the counts and is more like:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>On the constituency level seat are elected on a single winner basis. On the district or national level (i.e. above the constituency level), the additional seats in the assembly are allocated to parties proportionally to the number of votes the party received in the party portion of the ballot, taking into account the seats already won in the constituencies; for example a <a href="../../../h/i/g/Highest_averages_method.html" title="Highest averages method">highest averages method</a> is used in the proportional part, the sries of divisors starts at a higher point.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The second of these is actually closer the the word "additional", and means that <a href="../../../o/v/e/Overhang_seat.html" title="Overhang seat">overhang seats</a> are no longer a meaningful issue - a party which wins "too many" constituencies simply wins no proportional seats, and so cannot be taking away seats from anyone else. Part of the philosophical difference is shown in the reversal of UK and NZ ballot papers. --<a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenrygb_9b92.html" title="User:Henrygb">Henrygb</a> 16:42, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is discussed (inconclusively) above but I have to bring this subject up again. I've been reading about electoral systems for many years and have never heard AMS defined as anything other than another name for 'mixed member proportional'. In fact IMHO, with the exception of New Zealand, <i>AMS</i> is the more commonly used name than <i>MMP</i>. Reading the comments above the current definition used in this article seems to be based solely on a mistake made by some Wikipedians on the table of votings systems articles and an overly literal reading of the name <i>AMS</i>. As <a href="../../../p/m/6/User%7EPm67nz_cbcb.html" title="User:Pm67nz">Pm67nz</a> says, many electoral systems are poorly named. I think this article should redirect to <a href="../../../m/i/x/Mixed_member_proportional_representation.html" title="Mixed member proportional representation">Mixed member proportional representation</a> and any unique material be merged with that article and <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parallel_voting.html" title="Parallel voting">parallel voting</a>. <a href="../../../i/o/t/User%7EIota_1ff6.html" title="User:Iota">Iota</a> 19:38, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've read those comments and have been trying to respond to them. Correct me if I'm missing something, but the current definition seems to have been justified on only two grounds:</p>
<ol>
<li>The fact that some Wikipedians used the term in a certain way on the voting systems table, from which it has been inferred that the current definition is part of common use.</li>
<li>One possible interpretation of the literal meaning of "Additional Member System".</li>
</ol>
<p>The acid test, surely, is not what some Wikipedians have done, or the personal interpretation that Wikipedians give the literal meaning of a term, but what the literature says. So has anyone ever read anything that uses the same definition that this article does? I'm not asking for specific citations at this point, I'd just like to know, in a general way, if other peoples' actual experiences of the use of this term contradict my own. <a href="../../../i/o/t/User%7EIota_1ff6.html" title="User:Iota">Iota</a> 14:41, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The proposed merger (which has had the tag for quite a while) should <b>not</b> occur. The term "Additional Member System" can be used (and is) to refer to both MMP and SM. They are both related electoral systems, and are related as they both have some form of additional members. This page servers as a useful disamb and explains the differences between the two.

The problem is, the term AMS is not used as an over-riding term for both, but exclusively for one or the other. So, my proposal is for AMS to redirect to Mixed Electoral Systems (which is used for to refer to both). --<a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidnighttonight_662c.html" title="User:Midnighttonight">Midnight</a><a href="../../../m/i/d/User_talk%7EMidnighttonight_d19a.html" title="User talk:Midnighttonight">tonight</a> 00:27, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
