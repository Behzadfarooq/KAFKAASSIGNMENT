<p>Addhoc, would you please take a look at the Sex Tourism discussion page when you get a chance. I added links to support the second paragraph as you suggest. But, I really think Edgarde is getting out of line. I just don't know what to do about it. Let me know what you think.<br />

<p>The <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarwatt_1f61.html" title="User:Marwatt">User:Marwatt</a> is making article Marwat a personal article. He is politically and personally oppoent to the tribe of some people. He dragged the personal enimty on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>, which is too bad. I am also a political oppoent to the people A M. Khan writes about, but believe me what ever he si writing is based upon truth. As wikipedia is not a property of my father, I have no question in making it fair and clean one. I support <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_M._Khan_c4c8.html" title="User:A M. Khan">User:A M. Khan</a> even being a political opponent. But be known that if <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarwatt_1f61.html" title="User:Marwatt">User:Marwatt</a> be given a warning for personalising and politicising the Wikipedia and specially the article <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marwat.html" title="Marwat">Marwat</a> and relevant articles to it, whole of the problem will be solved.</p>
<p>Make a justice, please. Go through discussion and history you will know the culpability of <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarwatt_1f61.html" title="User:Marwatt">User:Marwatt</a>. He is responsible for vandalising the article, as he is keep on deleting the useful and true informations, those are mentioned with proofs.</p>

<p>Dear <a href="../../../a/d/d/User%7EAddhoc_21d7.html" title="User:Addhoc">User:Addhoc</a>, I am hopeful, regarding the appeal for Justice made by User:Lakki Marwat. You are having good record impression and pleasant attitude. Otherwise I am hopeless to make a plea to most of the Administrators on <a href="../../../w/p/_/WP_84ae.html" title="WP">WP</a>, as it is hard to achieve justice by them. As you are a senior member of <a href="../../../k/c/_/WP%7EKC_cf13.html" title="WP:KC">WP:KC</a>, you must be kind to me, even if I am wrong. So you correct me in a lovely manner, as a human deserves to be corrected in such a way.</p>
<p>Here I must tell you one thing humbly, that I don't want to discuss the edits on the article <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marwat.html" title="Marwat">Marwat</a>. I believe the edits should be into discussion at article’s discussion page. Where no one likes to discuss but keep on approaching administrations for their help.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I just would like to make you know one thing, by drawing your attention towards article <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marwat.html" title="Marwat">Marwat</a> that is vandalise by one of the fellow who is having almost similar username to article.</p>
<p>If you visit the Discussion Page of article <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marwat.html" title="Marwat">Marwat</a>, you will find a paragraph (#19), written by <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarwatt_1f61.html" title="User:Marwatt">User:Marwatt</a>. In that paragraph (#19), heading and first line is written in pure <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pashto.html" title="Pashto">Pashto</a> Language (the headline and first-line is quoted below in bold).</p>
<p><br />
( Quoted )</p>
<p><b>Kasam Pe Khduai Ka de rana We Lekal</b> (Head Line)</p>
<p><b>Ter so pore che ze zamdai yem, Wala ka rana Akhtar Munir ya nor fazoolyat pe de article che wachai.</b> (End of Quoting)</p>
<p><br />
The meanings of these two lines is "That I vow to God, that I won't let you write". "Till I am alive, I swear upon Allah (God), you can't mention the name of Akhter Munir in this article"</p>
<p><br />
<b>Addhoc</b>, doesn’t this means that this is a challenge and there is a personal enmity, political enmity besides this editing (vandalism)?</p>
<p>See the discussion page of that article, <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarwatt_1f61.html" title="User:Marwatt">User:Marwatt</a> is fail to defend his edit/deletes, clearly.</p>
<p><br />
If you take an interest in resolving the dispute and "issue" of editing for article <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marwat.html" title="Marwat">Marwat</a>, I am sure the page will get a rest and updating instead of being a battleground for my fellows.</p>

<p>Dear Addhoc, as a fellow member of AMA I would like to bring this to your kind notice what <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_M._Khan_c4c8.html" title="User:A M. Khan">User:A M. Khan</a> has written to my above <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pashto.html" title="Pashto">Pashto</a> warning (our native language and to some degree accurately translated by him) to his vandalism on page <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marwat.html" title="Marwat">Marwat</a>. I will consider it vandalism because it carries a POV.</p>
<p>And I quote;</p>
<p><i>"Anyhow, your claim for being a government official, not proved so far. I wish if you really are a government official. So I would like to see, that how you can make NAB nabbing Akhter Munir of whom ""<b>stick</b>"" can hardly be held in your hands. I hope you understood by memorising the famous proverb of Pashto."</i></p>
<p>I am sure Addhoc that you understand the meaning of a "Stick" over here as it carries the similer meaning in all languages. Would you consider that civil. This is my question from you??. I have already filed a case for checking his sock puppets of User:Ghazni Khel, User:Lakki Marwat, 210.56.14.139, and 203.175.64.10. You must also be aware of this fact that he was banned by <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_JPS_fb9e.html" title="User:The JPS">User: The JPS</a> earlier as well for misbehaving.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarwatt_1f61.html" title="User:Marwatt">Marwatt</a> 14:34, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I affirm that I was banned <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_JPS_fb9e.html" title="User:The JPS">User: The JPS</a>, but I was also unbanned by him after I made clarification to him.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/d/d/User%7EAddhoc_21d7.html" title="User:Addhoc">User: Addhoc</a>, let me clear to you humbly, that stick means the same as you will find in the dictionary. As Akhatr Munir Khan <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marwat.html" title="Marwat">Marwat</a> uses '<i>stick</i> to walk, after he fell from stairs, few weeks before. I am just pointing that stick. Remember, I never wanted to bring up personal issues here, as I mentioned above, but <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarwatt_1f61.html" title="User:Marwatt">User: Marwatt</a> made it first.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/d/d/User%7EAddhoc_21d7.html" title="User:Addhoc">User: Addhoc</a> as you are administartor and AMA member, I would like to make a please to kindly resolve the issue of article <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marwat.html" title="Marwat">Marwat</a> that has been a battle-ground for past few months due to an induvidual <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarwatt_1f61.html" title="User:Marwatt">User: Marwatt</a> who loves to persoanlise the article as he is having Personal enmity with those "Notable People" whom I mention always.

<dd>Anything I should do/not do that you advise? One concen I have...along with a couple of other editors, is that Shotwell's views seem a bit extreme and so similiar to those of Sarner, a leader of the advocacy group, Advocates for Children in Therapy and that Shotwell's views are not supported by a significant number of other editors. As one editor asked, what is our obligation regarding mediation and accomodation when there is just one voice and many others feel they have responded to his concerns/questions reasonably and see not need to make the changes he is suggesting (see those suggestions as unwarranted and a bit extreme)? <a href="../../../d/p/e/User%7EDPeterson_3157.html" title="User:DPeterson"><font color="red">DPeterson</font></a><sup><a href="../../../d/p/e/User_talk%7EDPeterson_eca1.html" title="User talk:DPeterson">talk</a></sup> 23:59, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Regarding the possibility of sockpuppetry, I would advise that we shouldn't mention this before filing a <a href="../../../s/s/p/WP%7ESSP_fb6b.html" title="WP:SSP">sockpuppet report</a> and obviously we can only file that if we have sufficient evidence. Regarding mediation, I would suggest that we should use the discussion to demonstrate there is a consensus for a balanced, neutral wording and that Shotwell's views are somewhat extreme. <a href="../../../a/d/d/User%7EAddhoc_21d7.html" title="User:Addhoc">Addhoc</a> 11:11, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Oh, I don't think that Shotwell and Sarner are "sockpuppets," I was just noting that Shotwell's views are so very similiar to that of Sarner, who is a leader of the fringe advocacy group, ACT, which has had problems with several of the pages in dispute here.</dd>
<dd>I like your idea of continuing with mediation and using the discussion to demonstrate that there is a consensus for a balanced, neutral wording and that his views are extreme.

<p>Shotwell has made some vague proposals that I have responded to on my talk page and on a page he created: User:Shotwell/DDP and ACT. If you could take a look at my comments and then let me know what you think, I'd appreciate it.

<dd>Thanks for letting me know. I would suggest that it would be preferable if the discussion was on a mediation page, instead of in Shotwell's user space. Also, I would agree Shotwell's comments are somewhat vague. <a href="../../../a/d/d/User%7EAddhoc_21d7.html" title="User:Addhoc">Addhoc</a> 10:31, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, I just saw that. Is there some way to have the mediator close the case as "resolved" with the pages staying as they are (as I and several others wanted), so that I don't have to raise this issue again, get an advocate and go through mediation? In other words have a more formal resolution that the issues are ended after extensive discussion and the result is that the pages stay as is? I'd posted on his page something like that. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Shotwell/DDP_and_ACT#Out_of_town_Tired_of_this_dispute" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Shotwell/DDP_and_ACT#Out_of_town_Tired_of_this_dispute" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Shotwell/DDP_and_ACT#Out_of_town_Tired_of_this_dispute</a>

<p>I got a curious message today, as apparently the MedCab case between the two is open, and the message on my talk page that was left says I was named as a party. If this is the case, I was not informed of this. I am aware of one MedCab request that was made directed by WideFox at Kilz, but I was not named as a party. I find it curious, since the only role I have had is to warn both of them on their indiscretions. Can you please verify whether or not I am named in such a case?

<dd>To be honest, I'm not sure where to start. I've put all the pages you've listed on my watchlist and there hasn't been any movement in the last week.

If you believe you can demonstrate that an individual editor has been disruptive, you could file a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">RFC</a> and if you require assistance, the <a href="../../../a/m/a/WP%7EAMA_ced1.html" title="WP:AMA">AMA</a> handle this sort of dispute. In my capacity as mediator, I usually try and resolve edit wars, however in this case all of the templates appear to be stable. If the situation was that an article was non-compliant with policy, then obviously I would attempt to mediate towards a compliant solution. In this case however, the templates don't appear to infringe <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> or <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a>. I recognise there could be advantages to including the same graphic in all of the templates, however I agree with Keitei this could be achieved by including a catagory.

<p>Okay, I think I was wrong to submit a user conduct issue to MedCab. Sorry. Please show me how to withdraw my request.

<dd>Thank you for reopening the case. Of immediate concern to me are Simonapro's past and continuing accusations that I have violated Wikipedia policies WP:CIV and WP:VAND. Of additional concern is Simonapro's stated intention to engage in a revert war<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cannabis&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=86005636" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cannabis&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=86005636" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, while failing to directly address concerns regarding the reliability of the source <a href="../../../c/a/n/Talk%7ECannabis_ff6a.html#Greg_Green" title="Talk:Cannabis">Talk:Cannabis#Greg Green</a>. Of ongoing concern is that Simonapro often misconstrues or misrepresents references (most recently: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cannabis&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=86018834" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cannabis&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=86018834" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cannabis&amp;diff=86019023&amp;oldid=86018479" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cannabis&amp;diff=86019023&amp;oldid=86018479" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cannabis&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=86127763" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cannabis&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=86127763" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>), and habitually engages straw men (most recently: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Simonapro&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=86223833" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Simonapro&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=86223833" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>). Simonapro has not been receptive to comments by third parties regarding either content or conduct. It does not seem likely that further attempts to negotiate will be effective. Your commments and any advice about how best to resolve these issues would be greatly appreciated.

<dd>Obviously there is the possibility of a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html#Request_comment_on_users" title="WP:RFC">RFC</a>, this would require that we could demonstrate our efforts to resolve the situation. Looking at his talk page the comments by <a href="../../../e/p/t/User%7EEpte_18c5.html" title="User:Epte">Epte</a> would certainly be good enough. Could I suggest the next step is that you leave Simonapro a similar message. Thanks, <a href="../../../a/d/d/User%7EAddhoc_21d7.html" title="User:Addhoc">Addhoc</a> 19:40, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Most of your recent redirects do not work. You must use the actual text of the article name, not the URL text and do not put anything else on the line.
