<p>hi. i made some major changes to the intro. i don't think the opponent process theory of addiction holds enough water in the medical community to be mentioned in the very beginning of the article. i've worked in an addiction lab for 2 years and the only time i remember that one coming up is in my intro psych class. also, chemical dependence, habit-forming, and addiction: NOT the same, NOT interchangable. i thought it was a better start to give a loose definition, but bring up the split in the research community of whether it is appropriate to confine the definition to drugs or to include behavior like sex or eating. my PI is of the former school- she gets so mad about it! <a href="../../../a/m/u/User%7EAmutepiggy_d05f.html" title="User:Amutepiggy">Amutepiggy</a> 00:57, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The term "psychological addiction" does not have a medical precedent, and should be classified under the <b>Casual Addiction</b> subheading (as that seems to refer to misuse of the term addiction). Psychological addiction IS NOT a form of addiction. The dictionary definition of addiction is "Addiction is a strong dependence on a drug typified by three factors: 1) severe withdrawal symptoms; 2) tolerance to a given dose, or the need for more and more of the substance; and 3) the loss of control.". Addiction is a medical term designating the continued and increased use of a drug to avoid withdrawl symptoms, NOT simply a habitual behavior. This needs to be emphasized in the article. <a href="../../../d/r/y/User%7EDryGrain_7436.html" title="User:DryGrain">DryGrain</a> 23:11, 19 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>In this case how would you explain Cocaine Addiction? WebDome</p>
<hr />
<p>The problem is that the dictionary definition of addiction is not exactly the same as the medical definition. Cocaine addiction meets (3) in the dictionary definition rather clearly. The way it meets (1) is through the withdrawal symptom of depression. It doesn't really meet (2) at all. And yet clearly individuals can addict to cocaine use. Psychological addiction, casual addiction, etc. are all attempts to define the term so that it meets the various types of addictive behavior. When you get down to the medical issues, one big issue is that sedative addiction is a very different animal from opioid addiction...different parts of the brain...different disease course...different treatments...etc. I'm removing the word "craving" from the entry only because craving doesn't exist in some forms of addiction (such as sedative addiction). Hope that's acceptable. <a href="../../../d/r/g/User%7EDrgitlow_8bf4.html" title="User:Drgitlow">Drgitlow</a> 01:24, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Decades ago, addiction was a pharmacological term that clearly referred to the use of a tolerance-inducing drug in sufficient quantity as to cause tolerance (the requirement that greater dosages of a given drug be used to produce an identical effect as time passes).</b> That pharmacological term called drug resistance. Ex. resistance to antibiotics in infection treatment. Any drug is "tolerance - inducing" over the period of time, tollerance in other words is adaptation. It has nothing to do with addiction.WebDome</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><b>With that definition, humans (and indeed all mammals) can be addicted to various drugs quite quickly.</b> Wrong, The term addiction derives from the Latin word addicere, which means "to sentence".WebDome</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, a lay definition of addiction developed. This definition referred to individuals who continued to use a given drug despite their own best interest. This latter definition is now thought of as a disease state by the medical community.</p>

<li>Yes and no. This caution from a New Zealand government agency demonstrates that cutting coffee out of your routine is about more than just a few days of being cranky. "An individual withdrawing from caffeine because of a chronic toxic overdose may experience symptoms of withdrawal including headache, nausea, nervousness, reduced alertness and depressed mood. These symptoms are most acute during the first 20-48 hours, but they may persist for as long as 7 days. Discontinuation of caffeine at even a moderate intake can lead to these symptoms. There is also a danger of developing dependence by having that cup of coffee for the headache caused by caffeine withdrawal." <a href="http://www.medsafe.govt.nz/Profs/PUarticles/caffeine.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.medsafe.govt.nz/Profs/PUarticles/caffeine.htm" rel="nofollow">Medsafe</a> <a href="../../../d/w/i/User%7EDwindrim_6e1c.html" title="User:Dwindrim">Denni</a> 20:29, 2004 Feb 16 (UTC)</li>

<li>Note that cannabis is listed as <i>behaviorally</i> addictive. It certainly can be that, and when a regular user can't get it, s/he goes through all the classic withdrawal symptoms.

<dd>That is called seeking behavior, a concept not yet discussed in this article. It is related to the reinforcing properties of a drug. Which are all related to the concepts described herein variously as addiction and dependence. Cannibas is listed in <i>some</i> places as behaviorally addictive. It also has been shown to be associated with withdrawal symptoms. And the tolerence properties of cannibas are related to the canabinoid profile of a particular stash. THC-d9 typical of finer kind-bud has a different tolerance profile than schwag genotypes with higher concentrations of cannabidol and/or cannabidiol.</dd>
<dd>And have you ever measured the increase in cortisol in your blood, an increase in blood pressure, or an increase in body temperature in the hours and days without cannibas after a few days or weeks of regular use? NIH has, maybe not in your body, but in the body of plenty of monkeys and other primates like us. Withdrawal in some people, after certain dosage levels, results in measurable increases of mid-brain anxiety reactions.</dd>

<dd>Seeking behavior, reinforcing properties, tolerance, withdrawal, and continued use regardless apparent harm and beyond any potential therapeutic benefit -- all of these things have been repeatedly documented in some regular marijuana users.

<dd>I tried to sort out the growth of taxonomy from <i>addiction</i> to <i>dependence</i> but addiction is still used in medical settings and in popular settings. There is a lot more that needs to be done to get this up to par, but maybe these latest edits will make it somewhat more interesting to someone with deep professional knowledge of the topic. This article can never say what is addiction and what is dependence, it can only site multiple and conflicting standards of various professional associations. And those discussions have been plagued for years by conflicting political interests that at times have interfered with users' genuine need to know about the substances we choose to self-titrate. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChocolate_bar_c9da.html" title="User:Chocolate bar">Chocolate bar</a> 08:05, 14 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We know cocaine addiction exists. The difficulty is getting it to fit into the overall "addiction" rubric. For example, individuals with cocaine addiction don't have an objectively measurable physical withdrawal as they do from alcohol. But they do have significant depressive symptoms. They don't generally build up significant tolerance as they do with both sedatives and opioids. They do have ongoing use of the drug despite their best interests, however. <a href="../../../d/r/g/User%7EDrgitlow_8bf4.html" title="User:Drgitlow">Drgitlow</a> 01:49, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What I have come to believe is a gross oversight of the mental health profession is the recognition that not all addictions are dysfunctional. Thus I have added the definition chart at the beginning. Another gross oversight that I feel that the mental health profession has failed to recognize is the condition I have labeled Mass Behavior Addiction. Under the dysfunctional section of this category, I feel that many cults and totalitarian systems could be classified. Comments?</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Emailuser&amp;target=Scottperry" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Emailuser&amp;target=Scottperry" rel="nofollow">Scott</a> April 18, 2004</p>
<p>Scott, your construct of addictions is well on the way to being what could be a useful rhetoric for explaining addiction theory. But, in as much is it is <i>what you believe</i> it is not encyclopedic. Wikipedia, or encyclopedias in general, summarize what has been widely discussed in society. The ideas of symbiotic addictions versus disfunctional addictions are interesting, but they do not reflect the vast study of addiction by practitioners and by academies. Right or wrong, an encyclopedia article needs to first explore what has been done then review that information in the light of critical theories <i>if those theories have some wide basis in popular discourse</i>.</p>
<p>If you can find support in literature for how symbiosis is accepted as a view of addiction, that should be included, but I am somewhat familiar with literature on addiction and can't readily find that. The Social Norms Model is widely used for several areas of study and education that overlap with addiction - it is used somewhat in college alcohol abuse prevention education, for example, but it is more common to sociology than to addiciction medicine or addiction theory. Maybe you could summarize the origins and assumptions of social norms modeling in a new article on social norms model, which could provide a theoretical and practical basis for including the concept in this article. ----</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/d/Talk%7EAddiction_7be0.html" title="Edit section: One Definition of Addiction">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">One Definition of Addiction</span></h2>
<p>I moved this table from the article to the talk page for several reasons. One is that it was set up as a 334 pixel chart, which forces the Wikipedia namespace out of bounds for any user using 600X800 resolution. Tables resolve best when set up as a percentage of the window, as was the chart contributed April 14.</p>
<p>Color selection is a subjective choice, but the new chart colors seemed bold and intrusive, rather than simple and leading into the table, as they were on the April 14 chart. Most internet page layout guides recommend use of one or two colors, but three colors might tend to be distracting rather than tend to contribute to readibility.</p>
<p>Beyond these layout problems, this chart has logical problems. "Not all medical practitioners agree on what comprises addiction or dependency." is redundant in that a more precise review of evolving differences in addiction medicine, and the organizations involved in addiction medicine, was already a part of the article.</p>
<p>"One definition of addiction" is not attributed to any organization of behavioral medicine practitioners, any addiction medicine society, or even an academic source. Obviously, being "one definition" does not assure it is not one person's definition, or that it is a widely accepted definition. Since definitions of addiciton can only be opinion, an encyclopedic article on addiction should first summarize the opinions of practitioners working professionally in the field. "<b>Mass Behavioral Addictions</b>" appears to be an idiosyncratic concept - the phrase gets exactly zero hits as a unique phrase on Google, so it might not belong in an encyclopedic article on the current science and popular literature related to addiction. That said, the information is interesting, and might be attributed to a source, but ScottPerry would do well to name a source. If some source can be cited to support the concept of general/disfunctional and symbiotic addictions, as described in a table, the article would be more reflective of current knowledge if it does not override the summary of addiction definitions drawn on standard medical approaches. I say that because the layout would better serve readers effort to see the world through the encyclopedia if space attributed to various ideas in the article were proportional to the amount of discussion and literature the supports the various concepts. <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalbiano_fb73.html" title="User:Talbiano">Talbiano</a></p>

<p>I've moved the paragraph on the "social norms model", added by Scottperry, here. The information contained in it may have a place in the article, if properly integrated, but it doesn't belong in a section of explanations for addiction. Perhaps someone can add a section on addiction education.</p>
<p><i>"The</i> social norms model <i>is often employed in educational efforts intended to demonstrate, especially to student populations, that self-administration of psychoactive substances is not a normative behavior. Educators often employ the social norms model in attempts to demonstrate that those who frequently use alcohol or other psycho-active substances in ways that pose the threat of physical harm are a minority, and that the majority of a social group approaches the use of potentially harmful substances with caution and moderation."</i></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/d/Talk%7EAddiction_7be0.html" title="Edit section: Definitions and citations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Definitions and citations</span></h2>
<p>There are many statements made in this article about what addiction is, and precious few citations or qualifications. Every statement is made as if it were indisputable fact. Yet in the past century, these definitions have evolved considerably. Even in the past few decades there has been significant shifts in thinking about addiction, dependence, drug abuse, and so on.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Addiction is an uncontrollable compulsion to repeat a behavior regardless of its consequences.</i> — Why is this not qualified? For example, "addiction is <i>widely regarded in current medical practice</i> to be …"</li>
<li><i>Addiction is now narrowly defined as "uncontrolled, compulsive use despite harm"; if there is no harm to the patient or another party, there is no addiction.</i> — citation please</li>
<li><i>the primary attribute of an addictive drug is its ability to induce euphoria while causing harm.</i> — What is the criteria for determining whether harm was <i>caused by</i> the drug?</li>
<li><i>Addictions can theoretically form for any rewarding behavior, but typically only do so in individuals with emotional, social, or psychological dysfunctions</i> — omg; citation please.</li>
<li><i>There is also a lesser known situation called pseudo-addiction</i> — citation please; if it's lesser-known, all the more reason to be careful not to misrepresent how widely-held this notion is.</li>
<li><i>Not all doctors do agree on what addiction or dependency is</i> — this should be an introductory statement and examples of the variety of views should follow; why is it buried?</li>
<li><i>Nicotine is considered by many to be the most addictive substance in the world, although there has been no way found to determine this.</i> — possibly a contentious statement; citation please.</li>
<li><i>Caffeine, ingested by more than 80% of human adults, is the most popular psychoactive substance in the world.</i> — citations for stats please (not that I don't believe this particular statement).</li>
<li><i>Early editions of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders described addiction as a physical dependency to a substance that resulted in withdrawal symptoms in its absence. Recent editions, including DSM-IV, have moved toward a diagnostic instrument that classifies such conditions as dependency, rather than addiction.</i> — here's some citations (sort of), but why is this under "Methods of care"?</li>
<li><i>...in addition to the adoption and twin studies that have been well replicated, much of the medical community is satisfied that addiction is in part genetically moderated.</i>— Well replicated studies with no citation? If anyone knows, please add a cite.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
The "Diverse explanations" section seems to be quite closely related to defining addiction and explaining the divergent points of view; it should be much closer to the beginning of the article.</p>
<p><i>Addictions can also be formed due to opponent process reactions … Because of opponent process[,] criminal behavior, running, stealing, violence, acting, test taking can become habit forming.</i> — Is the term 'habit-forming' (it should be hyphenated, I believe) meant to be synonymous with 'addictive'? I think many would consider a 'habit' to be much less extreme than an 'addiction', no?</p>
<p>Those are the main points that I see in need of cleanup. Can some of the people more invested in the current content of this article attempt to address some of these points? It is doubtful that I will have time to research them in the near term. I have, however, been working on getting a lot of definitions and citations into the <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drug_abuse.html" title="Drug abuse">drug abuse</a> article.

<dd>changed the bit about the habit- i'm a stickler for keeping addiction to mean drug/alcohol addiction, though i am trying to keep my POV out a here as much as i can bear it. still, "habit-forming" is not the same as addiction, whether you include behaviors or not.</dd>

<dd>i'm starting to go through and find some info to back up some of the claims you listed. i always have trouble figuring out how to format citations- should they just go in the same section? <a href="../../../a/m/u/User%7EAmutepiggy_d05f.html" title="User:Amutepiggy">Amutepiggy</a> 01:26, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Also, it should be noted that some highly addictive drugs (so-called hard drugs), such as cocaine, induce relatively little physical dependence, whilst other drugs (so-called soft drugs) such as magic mushrooms and peyote are not normally considered to give rise to any significant degree of addiction or dependence, Here you say the same thing about both drugs wich is "such as conaine induce relatively Little physical dependence" and "are not normally considered to give rise to any significant degree of addiction or dependance" so what are you trying to say, drugs arn't addictive? I was confused by that, you might want to clarify or word it better.</p>
<p>I agree with the comments here.. Why are anti-depressants excluded as being addictive in the article. If a drug causes negative effects in a user when they do not have the drug in sufficient titer in their body, is that not addiction? I don't understand how one can exclude them from the definition of being addictive. The drug companies do not want this to be part of the characterization of the drug. The psychological neurological dependency on the drug is what defines the "addiction". Now if a diabetic does not take insulin properly they will ultimately be at risk, but the effects are not "directly" neurological, rather the low blood sugar causes "general" effects that can lead to coma and death. In the case of anti-depressants the effects of withdrawal, ie. low titer, are DIRECTLY neurological,. this is a very important aspect of the article as the anti-depressants are commonly used, and the langague used by doctors as suggested by drug companies are clearly intended to minimize concerns about dependency, and effects of withdrawal, and anything that would suggest that some of these drugs are ADDICTIVE... This is a very important part of definition and the current article takes the anti-depressants out of this sphere,, not sure this is accurate or correct or responsible..</p>

<p>Regarding the paragraph that begins "The middle striatal reward pathway...", some questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is "(from earlier in the circuit...)" supposed to be a clarification of "receives presynaptic input" for nontechnical readers? I think anyone who needs that clarified will have given up before reaching this point. Also, is "these earlier in the circuit cells" grammatically correct?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The same question about "Cells that are said to respond..." If this is supposed to be providing a definition of the phrase "cells that respond to" as used in the previous sentence, I don't think the definition is correct. (Surely the expression of receptors is not sufficient to say the cell responds to the associated agonist!)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Do "many believe that there are more neurotransmitters involved" <i>within the middle striatal reward pathway</i>, or do they believe that <i>other pathways</i>, which use other neurotransmitters, contribute to addiction?</li>
</ul>

<dd>i changed a lot of that section- ugh, forgot to sign in AGAIN. i always do that. anyway- the name is now "neurobiological basis" instead of "physiological basis." i hope it contains much of the same information, but clarified and with some reference to larger anatomical regions (not just "dopamine cells.") i want to put in more stuff about the orbitofrontal cortex- there is comorbidity of impulse control disorders and addiction, and chronic drug users have shown poor performance on lab-constructed tests of inhibition as well as hypoactivity in that region. essentially, the "bad brakes" may be just as important as the strong driving force from the reward regions. <a href="../../../a/m/u/User%7EAmutepiggy_d05f.html" title="User:Amutepiggy">Amutepiggy</a> 03:25, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just for perspective, I have always thought of addiction as <b>The inability to stop something you desire to stop.</b></p>
<p>..."The inability to stop something you desire to stop" is perhaps an oversimplification. Ambivalence derived from some sort of conflict seems to be a big issue with those that are perceived to be struggling with addiction. The conflict can be both an attraction to the euphoric effects of the object, yet a simultaneous repulsion to negative consequences of its usage. There might be a spreadsheet of advantages and disadvantages in the mind of the addict which may paralize one from moving away from an equilibrium (or status quo) that one has convinced oneself of being thoroughly stuck in.

<li>My two cents, and I speak of 100% irrefutable experience, is that the disease of addiction is progressive, incurable and fatal. Period. Well with drug addiction anyway.

<p>If addiction is a disease that is progressive, incurable, and fatal then all of those "spontaneous permanent remissions" (--using the disease venacular) were a result of divine intervention or just bad theory? What if addiction is the compulsion to use because of the user's misguided attempts at "happiness" or euphoria (or reduction of pain, anxiety, depression, etc.) in spite of the subsequent negative consequences. This might explain an addict's obsession to want to moderate --not so much the usage (of course), but moderation of the negative consequences. A pattern that can continue to everybody's consternation for a great deal of time.Anthronify 19:51, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Much of the discussion here is fascinating. I'm happy to help out. The American Society of Addiction Medicine, the specialty organization for MD/DO's who work in this field, obviously has a definition of Addiction. Its definition has been accepted by other relevant specialties in the medical community (pain medicine and so forth). While your discussion makes it clear that this is only one definition, it is the working definition used by medical specialists who treat this disorder on a daily basis. If that's the definition that you'd like here, I'm happy to provide it.<a href="../../../d/r/g/User%7EDrgitlow_8bf4.html" title="User:Drgitlow">Drgitlow</a> 03:04, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just came across this article and have to say I find the subject conceptually fascinating. I'm an economist who dabbles a little in philosophy, and have very little familiarity with psychology or medicine. However, I thought I might offer one or two rambling reflections on this subject!</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>A good definition of addiction must imply harm. Otherwise we're all trivially addicted to oxygen, water etc.</li>
<li>Time is a more important factor than it might seem. Much of what we think of as addictive behaviour involves a judgement that an individual is 'irrationally' seeking pleasure, relief etc. now at the cost of significant harm later. Thus ascribing addiction will very often involve <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethical.html" title="Ethical">ethical</a> judgements about intertemporal <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rationality.html" title="Rationality">rationality</a>. I wonder if the basis for such judgements has been given much thought. A couple of further points on this subject. First, society's attitude to the 'timing of pleasure' is strongly influenced by economics and religion. As <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marx.html" title="Marx">Marx</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/b/Weber.html" title="Weber">Weber</a> and others so astutely pointed out, the rise of <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalism.html" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a> was associated with an emerging ideology surrounding the value of postponing consumption, pleasure etc. for future benefit. This is often also associated with <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant.html" title="Protestant">Protestant</a> values. I wonder if protestant, capitalist societies are more likely to classify a greater number of people as 'addicts' if they don't conform with prevailing social and economic values. Second, if we take a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neoclassical_economics.html" title="Neoclassical economics">neoclassical economics</a> view of human behaviour, can addicts usefully viewed as individuals exhibiting behaviour with unusually high <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discount_rate.html" title="Discount rate">discount rates</a> (for time preference)?!</li>
<li>It might be possible to take a '<a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_choice.html" title="Public choice">public choice</a> approach' to those who classify and treat addicts. What are their sectional interests? And how might these sectional interests pursue their goals? A simple hypothesis might be that pharmaceutical companies would seek both to widen the overall defintion(s) of addiction, whilst also subdividing that into as many sub-categories as possible. This <a href="../../../r/e/n/Rent_seeking.html" title="Rent seeking">rent seeking</a> behaviour would maximise the potential for <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monopoly.html" title="Monopoly">monopoly</a> rents on treatments. The same may also apply to the commercial or bureaucratic interests in providing other 'therapies'. Such hypotheses might be usefully tested empirically.--<a href="../../../n/m/c/User%7ENmcmurdo_69fe.html" title="User:Nmcmurdo">Nmcmurdo</a> 01:36, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Each entry describes a given model (e.g. disease, genetic, etc.) but only the disease model has notation concerning what critics of the model believe. If we are to be neutral about this, either that sentence should be removed OR each of the models should have a sentence describing what critics of the model believe.

<p>Hello, all. I'm hopping over from the discussion on the <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcoholism.html" title="Alcoholism">Alcoholism</a> article trying to figure out the best way to summarize what you have here for those reading our article. I'm glad to see that you have a very well organized and informed article over here.</p>
<p>I can't help but notice that you don't mention the strong evidence for a neurochemical basis of opioid addiction posed by the work performed on alcoholism in Finland (alcohol releases endorphin, an opioid). The short version is that they discovered that continuation of normal drug taking habits (alcohol and opiates, but not nicotine) while taking an opioid antagonist results in a loss of interest in the drug taking habits over time. This effect persists indefinitely after the patient stops taking the opioid antagonists unless the person starts taking their addictive drug <i>without</i> the antagonist again, in which case the addiction is re-established. This has resulted in a treatment called <b>pharmacological extinction</b>, which has been demonstrated to work for alcohol, heroin, opium, and endorpine encouraged behaviors like gambling and overeating.</p>
<p>I'm not going to give you a song and dance, but I will provide a few links that you can use to verify this process.

<p>I find the paragraph using the argument around the absence of "free will" illogical, uncorrect, and not really contributing to the subject. Discussing free will on it's own page is fine, but the presented argument can be used to make every mental process or behavioral activity seamingly meaningless. It is not of special importance to addiction in any way. In addition, it can hardly be presented as generally accepted view of the matter at all. So I think it should be taken out of the article. A short reference to the problem of free will is fine, however.</p>

<dd>I agree, the issue of free will's involvment in addiction is ill defined and really a different subject. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> 22:59, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The reference to Tom Hinton (under "Casual Addiction") seems a bit oblique. Is he a well known MySpace addict? I don't get the reference. Perhaps I'm ignorant, but I can't find anything that relates.</p>

<p>There's an external link to Shelton on Fasting and Addiction which seems to be a chapter from <i>The Hygenic System Vol III: Fasting and sunbathing</i> by Herbert M. Shelton printed in the 60s. It's a fairly POV essay that doesn't seem to correspond to any documented findings we have in the article. I've never heard of either Sheldon or The Hygenic System, but wondered if i was just ignorant and this is in fact a famous book whose recommendations are being used to great success all over the world (or just provides historical interest for readers). --<a href="../../../s/i/o/User_talk%7ESiobhanHansa_31d8.html" title="User talk:SiobhanHansa">Siobhan Hansa</a> 20:56, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I believe these are untrue. They definitely shouldn't go in without a reference.</p>

<dd>Some of the highly addictive drugs (<i><a href="../../../h/a/r/Hard_drug.html" title="Hard drug">hard drugs</a></i>), such as <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cocaine.html" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a>, induce relatively little physical dependence.</dd>

<dd>It has been proved recently that most addictions are really just psychological. By saying you have a disorder addiction, you just are making an indirect excuse to get attention or you enjoy it too much.</dd>

<p>The article needs to be edited thoroughly. Some parts, particularly the introduction, are awkward and very poorly written. The poor use of the English language will hinder the reader's understanding of the concepts and, quite frankly, cause the reader to question not only the validity of what he is reading, but also the source itself [Wikipedia].</p>
