<p>Is it possible to get any response from you either to my email to you or to my posts on you page on Wikipedia?</p>
<p>Did I rashly break an unforgivable rule? Or were you my Advocate only because others involved with Starwood like Katharine asked you to be and not really for me as a person or to help me learn to deal with Wikipedia better? Or is it because when Ars Scriptor emailed you about me, he said something that resulted in you deciding that I was evil and to ignore me? Or do you just not like me?</p>
<p>It's a strange be ignored by you and to feel I don't exist here. I'm thinking that after the end of the year I will leave Wikipedia if what is happening does not become more transparent to me. If a person such as you feels contaminated by me then I ought not to be here. One more month -- that will make 8 months on Wikipedia for me total aad long enough to tell if there is any chance for me here.</p>
<p>Again, I apologise if I have alienated you or hurt your feelings or done something unforgivable. I am so sorry. Sincerely, <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattisse_2503.html" title="User:Mattisse">Mattisse</a> 12:27, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Matisse, sorry for not replying earlier, I was on holiday. At the moment, there appears to be some problem with my bowser.

<dd>Hi Addhoc, I am talking about the three emails I sent you after you agreed we should communicate by email, two while you were still my Advocate. Also the questions I posted to you that you did not answer. It feels strange to be ignored by your own Advocate! I expected an Advocate to interact with me and explain things I did not understand. I was not aware that your role was to keep a big distance from me. But it doesn't matter now and I do appreciate what you did do. Thank you.

<p>Please tell me what is going on? Not just a vague apology but some real information. The email from Ars Scriptor to you about me, after which you ignore me? His ANI and history of bias against me and history of siding with Hanuman Das and Ekajaki and Anger22? Why is your "Welcome to AMA" the only contact you have ever initiated with me? Is this the normal advocacy program? I don't understand. Why are you carrying on normally (per your contributations for today) but nothing but a vague reply on your talk page to me with no concrete or helpful information? Why do you not reply to eamil? Please be more forthcoming. Please take me seriously as a person and not "Mattisse Redux". Thank you.

<dd>I understand that. So that mean you feel no obligation to explain any of the past odd happenings to me, even if you are not my Advocate now? Nothing? Ever? Even the questions I asked when you were my advocate? Just zero? This (to me) seems unprofessional and wrong. I feel I have been left completely "out of the loop". So the end result is, when you were my Advocate you did not have to answer and questions or have any contact with me, and now that you are no longer my Advocate the same is true? I don't see the point of Advocacy then. Well, thanks for intimating (since you are not clearly stating anything and I have to read between the lines) that you do not ever intend to clarify anything. I will not trouble you again. Sincerely, <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattisse_2503.html" title="User:Mattisse">Mattisse</a> 19:09, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

That's a shame, seeing as how you put so much effort into that account. I'm thinking about reporting you. It can't be good for Wikipedia to have advocates who try and abuse their power like that, wouldn't you agree?

<p>Your replies to posted questions were superficial - you did not educate or provide guidance as it sounded like I would receive from the AMA page. And now I only accidently ran across you message to me since I am not contributing to articles anymore. Otherwise I probably would not have known you answered me. Thank you.

Addhoc/Archive8, <b>thank you</b> for your support in <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Davidruben_4db1.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Davidruben">my RfA</a> which passed on 13th December 2006 with a tally of <b>49/10/5</b>. I am delighted by the result and a little daunted by the scope of additional responsibilities; I appreciate your comments re lack of experience in some aspects and I shall be cautious in my use of the new tools. I am well aware that becoming an Admin is not just about a successful nomination, but a continuing process of gaining further experience and I should welcome your feedback.

<p>Could I suggest that mundane editorial disagreements are most likely to resolve quickly and productively when editors observe the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remain polite per <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECivility_3fb1.html" title="WP:Civility">WP:Civility</a>.</li>
<li>Solicit feedback and ask questions.</li>
<li>Keep the discussion focused. Concentrate on a small set of related matters and resolve them to the satisfaction of all parties.</li>
<li>Focus on the subject rather than on the personalities of the editors.</li>

<p>I'm puzzled by your comments here (<a href="../../../s/i/l/User_talk%7ESilentriver_9ccb.html" title="User talk:Silentriver">User_talk:Silentriver</a>); you seem to be assuming bad faith regarding my edits and warning messages. <a href="../../../s/u/b/User_talk%7ESubwayguy_c9e9.html" title="User talk:Subwayguy"><sub><i><b>SUBWAY</b></i></sub>guy</a> 17:05, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm suggesting that instead of edit warring over the placement of tags and giving dubious warnings about alleged policy infringements, you could have spent your time cleaning up the article. <a href="../../../a/d/d/User%7EAddhoc_21d7.html" title="User:Addhoc">Addhoc</a> 18:45, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I believe all my tags and warnings were proper under the circumstances. I hardly think it was proper to call them "pointless" and to characterize me as "grumpy." However, I do agree with you that it would have been useful for me to have cleaned up the article personally: I will try to improve on that in the future. <a href="../../../s/u/b/User_talk%7ESubwayguy_c9e9.html" title="User talk:Subwayguy"><sub><i><b>SUBWAY</b></i></sub>guy</a> 03:56, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That's fine. I should have phrased my comments in a more constructive manner. <a href="../../../a/d/d/User%7EAddhoc_21d7.html" title="User:Addhoc">Addhoc</a> 14:46, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for your support in my RfA. I've felt it best to withdraw on this occasion and think about the good advice I received. As you suggested, I think I will try again, but I need to get that experience first.

<p>Hi Addhoc, I am honored by your barnstar. It is my wish that I may deserve it. Thank you.
