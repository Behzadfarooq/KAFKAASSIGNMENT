<dd>I agree that you should outsource the sigmas, but I strongly <b>disagree</b> with "<a href="../../../a/d/d/Addition_of_natural_numbers.html" title="Addition of natural numbers">Addition of natural numbers</a>" being incorporated into this article. That seems overly Bourbakist. The content of the article "<i>Addition of natural numbers</i>" certainly needs a better home, but it isn't here.

<dd>Well, then I won't do the merger yet, or perhaps at all; we'll see how <a href="../../../a/d/d/Addition.html" title="Addition">Addition</a> looks after the split to <a href="../../../s/u/m/Summation.html" title="Summation">Summation</a> and go from there. We'll still need to do <i>something</i> about <a href="../../../a/d/d/Addition_of_natural_numbers.html" title="Addition of natural numbers">Addition of natural numbers</a>, possibly taking a hard look at <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_number.html" title="Natural number">Natural number</a> itself.

<dd>Come on, as in the example I moved to <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musical_set_theory.html#Addition" title="Musical set theory">Musical_set_theory#Addition</a> was an overgrown example of arithmetic modulo 12. I replaced it with the comment, "In <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modular_arithmetic.html" title="Modular arithmetic">modular arithmetic</a>, the set of integers modulo 12 has twelve elements; it inherits an addition operation from the integers that is central to <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musical_set_theory.html" title="Musical set theory">musical set theory</a>." which now appears in the Generalizations section. I hope that the Generalizations section makes it clear that there are countless different versions of addition indispensible to all kinds of fields.</dd>
<dd>In fact, I'm more than a little uneasy that you've linked to it from the top of <a href="../../../a/d/d/Addition.html" title="Addition">Addition</a>.
<ol>
<li>The notion of addition in musical set theory doesn't have its own article, and</li>
<li>the material linked to never defines addition,</li>
<li>nor does it use the word "addition" except in the heading you added, and</li>
<li>the word "sum" is <i>just a link back to <strike>here</strike></i>. (<i>now a link back to <a href="../../../s/u/m/Summation.html" title="Summation">summation</a> after re-redirect of <a href="../../../s/u/m/Sum.html" title="Sum">sum</a>)</i></li>

<p>Does the source state that "addere" means "to give to"? Certainly, "ad" can mean "to" and "dare" means "to give", but that doesn't imply that "addere" means "to give to". Charlton T. Lewis, An Elementary Latin Dictionary, lists "to put to, place upon, lay on, join, attach" as meanings <a href="http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0060%3Aentry%3D%23305" class="external autonumber" title="http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0060%3Aentry%3D%23305" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Furthermore, the form "addend" does not exist in Latin. As you say, the word is inflected; the canonical form "addendus", which is the masculine singular nominative. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 02:37, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, I know virtually nothing about Latin (Does it show?), so let me just quote. Schwartzman says:
<dl>
<dd><b>add</b> (verb), <b>addition</b> (noun), <b>additive</b> (adjective): from the Latin verb <i>addere</i>, itself a compound of <i>ad</i> (<i>q.v.</i>) "to" and <i>dare</i> "to give." When you add an amount to something, you "give more to" that something. The Indo-European root is <i>do-</i> "to give." Related borrowings from Latin include <i>donate</i> and <i>condone</i> "to give sanction or approval." A related borrowing from Greek is the <i>dose</i> of medicine given to a patient. In arithmetic, the "+" symbol...</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>He seems pretty confident about the giving. I originally wrote "give more to" to follow the source, but I decided the "more" wasn't justified without speaking of "an amount", so I deleted it, leaving "give to".</dd>
<dd>I guess I shouldn't be too surprised that <i>addere</i> has other meanings; if you'd like to add Lewis' list, be my guest.</dd>
<dd>As for <i>addend</i> not actually being a Latin word, I wasn't sure about that, so I kind of hedged. How should we put it? <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 02:58, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, as long as I'm quoting, I should quote this entry:
<dl>
<dd><b>addend</b> (noun): from Latin <i>addere</i> "to add" (<i>q.v.</i>), with the suffix <i>-nd</i>, which creates a type of passive causative, so that Latin <i>numerus addendus</i> meant "the number to be added." In the statement 3 + 4 = 7, many Renaissance writers...</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>What the heck is a "passive causative"? Is it just a gerundive, or am I missing something? <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 03:06, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Under the section Notation and terminology, addition and add are said to be conjugations of the latin verb addere. They are more properly derivatives... A conjugation is a changed form of a verb indicating aspect, person, number, etc like it says in <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammatical_conjugation.html" title="Grammatical conjugation">grammatical conjugation</a>, but a nonal form or a reuse of a verb stem in another language is a <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derivative_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Derivative (disambiguation)">derivative</a>.

<dd>Sorry to be so late in checking back on this. Yes, a loan word is more like <i>cologne</i> or <i>bologna</i>.

<p>I would question the assertion that "Addition is not tremendously important to analog computers, whose essential function is integration.[23]" Analog computes are generally used to solve differential equations, not simple integration, and the RHS of most DE's of interest include the sum of more than one term.

<p>OK, now that I've been pointed to this article by another editor (whose <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalix_alba_9f89.html" title="User:Salix alba">good name</a> I shall not sully by mentioning), I'm going to offer an opinion before even attempting to work on it. (Caveat: I am not a math person. I am a writer and editor outside of Wikipedia; those are the skills and perspective I'm bringing here.)</p>
<ol>
<li>This article covers too much territory. It needs to be pared down to basics. Ideally, I think it should provide such a basic level of information that it can be used as a reference term elsewhere without overwhelming people when they click through to it.</li>
<li>I actually think <b>non</b>-mathematicians need to work on this article. I think this <b>may</b> be a case where too much knowledge is a bad thing. There's too much information and detail.</li>
<li>Addition is one of the most basic building blocks of math as I understand it. This article should reflect that. It should be simple, straightforward. At a glance, I'd say 80% of the content could be tossed, broken into separate articles, or reduced to "see also" or wikilinks.</li>
</ol>
<p>I realize this is going against what people have created here. This is why I'm putting this on the talk page before getting all <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">bold</a> on it.

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Here's my thinking: When an article gets as large as this, it's a cry to be divided into discrete parts which can concentrate on explaining the specifics. I realize that, because of the very foundational nature of "addition", there is a desire to enumerate these many mathematical and scientific connections in the same article. However, the drawback to this approach is the reader may be overwhelmed with detail.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I believe the language in the article needs to be vastly simplified.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>For example, I have to concentrate to understand the <b>first sentence</b> of the article. I have to <b>really</b> concentrate to understand the second sentence. It's not a brag to say I am fairly literate and well versed in the English language. And I <b>already</b> understand the concept of addition and the use of symbolic representative letters in math. Why is it so difficult? Perhaps it's a problem of translating math, a precise symbolic system, into less precise words. Beyond that point in the article there is an almost unremitting stream of specialized mathematical jargon/cant and terminology. (I'm using "jargon" in a non-pejorative manner here.) When a term is explained/defined with words whose specific contextual meaning is <i>also</i> difficult to understand, there's a problem. I suppose the many wikilinks are intended to provide additional clarification but it feels like a weak alternative to clearer original text.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not even sure I could do a better job on the article but I feel these are valid concerns so I'm expressing them. I'm a writer, a wordsmith, if you will. I'm certainly not an advocate of writing to an overly simplistic, grade-school level. But if I'm having trouble comprehending the text, I've found this is a good indication that a large majority of other readers will also have trouble. I <i>know</i> my points above are radical. However, I also know there comes a point when line editing and tweaking sentences will not noticeably improve the readability of the article. I believe this is one of those times.</dd>

<dd>You raise valid points that are equally applicable to many introductory-level math articles. It is unfortunately often true that the prose is too difficult or proceeds too quickly for the intended reader. I hope that you will consider making at least a few changes to illustrate how you would like to see the prose improved. Typically, the reason that things are phrased the way they are is that the original author didn't, or couldn't, think of a better way to say them. So some editing by a nonspecialist might inspire the rest of us in how to write the rest more clearly.

<dd>Indeed, first paragraphs in maths articles are always hard, I'm somewhat suprised that thiss has proved the case even for something as simple as addition.</dd>
<dd>Encarta has <i>The arithmetic operation of addition is indicated by the plus sign (+) and is a means of counting by increments greater than 1. For example, four apples and five apples could be added by putting them together and then counting them individually from 1 to 9. Addition, however, makes it possible to add, or compute, sums more readily.</i></dd>
<dd>Britannica <i>Combining two sets of objects together, which contain a and b elements, a new set is formed that contains a + b = c objects. The number c is called the sum of a and b</i></dd>
<dd><a href="../../../../simple/a/d/d/Addition.html" class="extiw" title="simple:Addition">Simple English wikipedia</a> has <i>In arithmetic, addition is putting two or more numbers together. The sign for addition is "+". The name for this sign "+" is "plus".</i></dd>
<dd>As to whether its too long, ther is some very advanced material here, especially in the Addition of natural and real numbers, which makes many references to set-theoretic quantities. These could possibly be split off to formal definitions of addition. Its worth also comparing with <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subtraction.html" title="Subtraction">Subtraction</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multiplication.html" title="Multiplication">Multiplication</a> which are both too short and don't come close to comprehensive. --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalix_alba_9f89.html" title="User:Salix alba">Salix alba</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/l/User_talk%7ESalix_alba_982c.html" title="User talk:Salix alba">talk</a>) 08:51, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I realize the difficulty of explaining addition in plain prose. I think that's why I ranted a bit on the talk page rather than just attempting some changes and providing an example of clearer language. I'll take a whack at the opening para and see if I can make it better. For the record, I think the whole intro should be reduced to a plain para or two on the <b>basic</b> concept of addition. Info currently in paras three and four shouldn't be in an intro at all. My basic mantra for an intro is <b>basic and simple</b>. Despite what I said above about not writing to a grade school level, I believe an intro needs to be written as simply as possible without misrepresenting the subject. If there are wikilinked words/phrases in the intro, they themselves need to be easily understood <b>without</b> clicking through. I'm speaking only of the intro here, not the rest of the article. Ugh. I'm sorry if I appear to be speaking condescendingly to an undoubtedly intelligent group here. It's not my intent to insult anyone. Oh, and thanks for the other examples, Salix and Melchoir.

<dd>Musing philosophically (after edit conflit with paul below) -</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../p/i/a/Piaget.html" title="Piaget">Piaget</a> 1965 - <i>it is a great mistake to suppose that a child acquires the notion of number and other mathematical concepts just from teaching. On the contrary, to a remarkable degree he develops them himself, independantly and spontaneously. When an adult try to impose mathematical concepts on a child prematurely, his learning is mearly verbal; true understanding of them come only with mental growth</i>.</dd>
<dd>My interpretation of this is that it is actually a hard thing to explain in words. When I've taught children basic arathmatic I've primarally used methods other than english paragraphs to explain the concepts - lots of manipulative materials like lego brick, and activities like counting squares and many many examples slowly leading up to a general theory. Bairly a word is written on the page.</dd>
<dd>The other problem is that mathematics is priamilly a constructive field, everything in mathematics builds on a simpler concept, hence addition first requires the idea of counting, 1,2,3,4... Then the idea of counting on hold up four fingers then raise 1,2,3 more fingers, now count how many fingers there are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. We see reference to other concepts in the other intro paragraphs above, <a href="../../../s/e/t/Set.html" title="Set">set</a> is mentioned by Britannica.</dd>
<dd>Then we have the fact that addition covers several related things, addition of counting numbers is subitly different to addition of lengths.</dd>
<dd>So I posit that there is an intrinsic dificulty with plain english sentances which do not refer to other concepts and cover the range of things which addition covers. None of the other intro paragraphs above is entirely satisfactory.

<p>OK, this is, of course, not as easy as I hoped. I feel a bit like a ass coming in and blustering about the difficulty in reading it and then struggling <i>much</i> more than I usually do in rewriting such a small section. Before anyone screams about the important points I eliminated, please consider that I attempted to focus solely on the very <b>basic</b> qualities of addition. I believe almost everything I took out was far too complicated for an intro. I also haven't looked carefully in the body of the article for the supporting documentation for the children and animals statement. I sure hope that's supported. Why would I leave something so peripherally related to addition like that in the intro and get rid of so much other info? Because it's human interest. "Oh, my child may know how to add before speaking? Wow, that's strange!" This is intended to draw people into the body of the article. It's called a teaser in print and TV.

<dl>
<dd>I admit I've got a few slings…
<ul>
<li>I don't think it's a good idea to introduce "adding" and "total" in the first sentence along with "addition". The main danger is that they're read as parts of the definition, which would make it circular. Maybe putting them in italics would help clarify their role?</li>
<li>"Combining" is vague. All binary operations could be described as combining two numbers — some quite meaningfully. My question is, <i>how</i> does addition combine its inputs in a way that distinguishes it from MAX, or subtraction, or averaging, or multiplication, or the Pythagorean sum…?</li>
<li>"Equal simple amount"?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>As for taking out things that are too complicated for an intro, just remember that the <a href="../../../l/e/a/Wikipedia%7ELead_section_3c3e.html" title="Wikipedia:Lead section">manual of style</a> advises us that the lead should reflect the whole article — and I agree, and so do the folks at <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a>.

<dd>Sorry for the lateness getting back here on this. Life intrudes. I acknowledge the things you pointed out, Melchoir. Most of your critique comes down to the difficulty I have in translating a symbolic and number based transaction into a simple English phrasing. While I should not argue with the WP manual of style, I still contend that if people can't make it through the lead section easily, they are highly unlikely to go further into the article. That's what I think the target is for a lead section: to include enough of the complexity of the full article but without overwhelming the casual reader. You'll have to excuse me if I say the overload threshold for most general readers of the maths articles is going to be lower than many other types of articles. I'm basing this on mostly on my own perceptions but I believe it holds true.</dd>
<dd>Every one of your points is well taken: the circular nature of using "adding" to describe addition, "combining" is a poor substitute for what was originally "increasing" I believe, and "equal simple amount" was a paraphrase from a <i>Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary</i> definition (and a stunning failure of a phrase in my opinion.) I'm trying to think my way through to another way of expressing it. Argh. Perhaps I'm not as flash as I like to think. This is easily one of the most difficult tasks I've attempted on WP, requiring exceptional precision in the choice of words and phrasing. Thinking now, I'll be back. --<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Pigman_7e6d.html" title="User:Paul Pigman"><b><font color="green">Pig</font></b><sup><font color="red">man</font></sup></a><sub><a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_Pigman_813e.html" title="User talk:Paul Pigman">dialogue</a></sub> 03:24, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the children and animals statement probably over states the case. From what I can tell these experiments do something like: put one object behind a screen, then put another object behind it. Finally the screen is removed and the child is suprised if there is not two objects behind it. This ability is far removed from a complete ability for addition, even for low numbers like 3+5. Indeed there are counter experiments where children between 4-7 have problems with inclusion of sets, given a set of 3 boys and 5 girls the child will answer incorrectly when asked if there are more children than girls.</dd>

<dd>Just found an interesting example of a definition. <i>Addition of numbers does not mean to increase but to group, join or rename a pair of numbers as a single number. The number idea is the same whether expressed as 3+2 or 5. ...</i> (Richard Copeland - How children learn mathematics, p133) --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalix_alba_9f89.html" title="User:Salix alba">Salix alba</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/l/User_talk%7ESalix_alba_982c.html" title="User talk:Salix alba">talk</a>) 10:29, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Salix, the def in your last para is interesting and seems really quite accurate to me. It covers a range of possible examples. Any other people's opinions on it? Of course the problem is finding a way to paraphrase it in just as clear language without plagiarizing it. --<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Pigman_7e6d.html" title="User:Paul Pigman"><b><font color="green">Pig</font></b><sup><font color="red">man</font></sup></a><sub><a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_Pigman_813e.html" title="User talk:Paul Pigman">dialogue</a></sub> 18:37, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Folks, I'm going to bow out of this discussion. Please do whatever you think appropriate to the intro. This re-write is easily one of the more stressful experiences in my recent Wikipedia participation (and that's saying something!) Perhaps it's my own lack of ease with the broader math subjects but I can't seem to adequately grasp the best English expression of these concepts. I feel that I'm just poking at it without having a firm vision of outcome. For me, this is very unusual. Be assured my backing off has nothing to do with the company discussing it here. I just have to back off for my own well-being. --<a href="../../../p/i/g/User%7EPigman_d995.html" title="User:Pigman"><b><font color="green">Pig</font></b><sup><font color="red">man</font></sup></a><sub><a href="../../../p/i/g/User_talk%7EPigman_f895.html" title="User talk:Pigman">dialogue</a></sub> 18:09, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
