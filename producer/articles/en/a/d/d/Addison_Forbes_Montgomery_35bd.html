<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/d/Addison_Forbes_Montgomery_35bd.html" title="Edit section: Background">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Background</span></h2>
<p>A highly regarded neonatal surgeon, Addison is also a board certified <a href="../../../o/b/-/OB-GYN_17bd.html" title="OB-GYN">OB-GYN</a> with fellowships in maternal-fetal medicine and medical genetics, she did two years of study on cystic fibrosis. She has been called "McHot" by the male interns, and has been compared to <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isabella_Rossellini_2e07.html" title="Isabella Rossellini">Isabella Rossellini</a> by Meredith. She was married to Derek for eleven years before having an affair with his best friend, plastic surgeon Dr. Mark Sloan, which prompted Derek to leave New York for Seattle. In spite of her chosen speciality and Derek's large family, Addison admits to Miranda Bailey that when she and Derek discussed having children, she realized she wasn't ready. After she and Derek initially separated, Addison remained in New York and lived with Mark for two months, during which she became pregnant and aborted Mark's baby. The relationship ended when Mark cheated on Addison and Dr. Webber brought her to Seattle Grace for a consult on a difficult case (and, presumably, to break things up between Derek and Meredith). Richard was aware of Derek and Addison's strained relationship, though not the cause of it ("Yesterday"). She decided to stay on as head of neonatal surgery at Seattle Grace, signing a lucrative 2 year contract, and she and Derek decided to work things out. After finding out about Derek's affair with Meredith, in a drunken haze, Addison called Mark Sloan to Seattle. Derek and Addison agreed that their marriage was over and started divorce proceedings. She asked Mark Sloan to go back to New York, but he stayed, expressing his desire to continue their relationship. Addison continues to rebuff him. When the divorce was finalized Addison dropped the "Shepherd" from her last name. A possibility of a relationship between she and Alex Karev has been hinted at, when she kisses him in Joe's bar. Even after he rejects her affections, she continues to lust after him from afar. She has (along with Mark Sloan) decided to abstain from sex for 60 days. If Dr. Sloan completes the challenge, she is willing to try a real relationship with him. She has expressed immense interest in being the next Chief of Surgery. Addison is one of only a handful of surgeons in the world who know how to separate fetal blood vessels.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/d/Addison_Forbes_Montgomery_35bd.html" title="Edit section: Character History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Character History</span></h2>
<p>Addison is a fellow of the American College of Surgeons. Addison met her ex-husband, Dr Derek Shepherd in medical school, she completed her residency under the supervision of her now good friend, Dr. Richard Webber, she avoided Richard for almost 12 months after he taught her a valuable lesson about not getting too close to her patients in a harsh way. Addison became extremely successful and began her own practice in New York. This put some strain on Addison and Derek's marriage. After Addison was caught cheating with Derek's best friend, Dr. Mark Sloan, Derek moved to Seattle to get away from her. There, he met Dr. Meredith Grey with whom he started a relationship. Addison then went to Seattle after Derek and Derek and Meredith broke up so that he and Addison could try to mend their marriage. This left Meredith feeling distraught and betrayed. After things didn't work out between them, Addison and Derek got a divorce and Derek went back to Meredith.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/d/Addison_Forbes_Montgomery_35bd.html" title="Edit section: Personality">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Personality</span></h2>
<p>Although Addison is famous for being difficult and often uncompromising, she has revealed softer aspects of her personality from time to time. She has openly claimed to be the best in her field on various occasions, and has promptly mentioned her resume to people who have questioned her abilities. One of the most competitive surgeons, Addison has sometimes challenged her colleagues, most notably <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Karev_5a40.html" title="Alex Karev">Alex Karev</a>, who has spent a long part of his internship with her. However, she also has an excellent bedside manner and, like Dr. Izzie Stevens, is known for becoming emotionally attached to a lot of her patients. Her father-daughter relationship with her mentor, Dr. Richard Webber, has often offered sanctuary to Addison, and has helped her reveal some of her insecurities. She has chosen to remain honest about her separation from her ex-husband and the details of her infidelity and has confessed to feeling guilty about her affair with Mark Sloan. As her good friend Miranda Bailey has observed, Addison tends to define herself through the men in her life. Her love life is often troubled, and she finds it difficult to commit to any longtime relationship.</p>
