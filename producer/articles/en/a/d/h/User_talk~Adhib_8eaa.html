OK, you probably did not mean to wreck the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">Conspiracy theory</a> page, but you did leave it mangled, with its bottom chopped off.

<p>I like the way you restructured <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">Conspiracy theory</a>. In particular, your comment <i>"what if a 15-year old kid needed to find out what 'conspiracy theory' is about, and came to this article to find out?"</i> makes a lot of sense. The articles need to be designed for people trying to get factual information on the topic. If you are willing, I'd like to see a similar restructuring of <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unidentified_Flying_Objects_3d3d.html" title="Unidentified Flying Objects">Unidentified Flying Objects</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/s/Roswell_UFO_Incident_5c6c.html" title="Roswell UFO Incident">Roswell UFO Incident</a>. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a> 15:41, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've learned a great deal from my strange conversations with fellow editors on <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">Conspiracy theory</a>.

<p>Hi Adhib, AndyL has changed Duke's diploma from Kiev to an honorary degree. Do you happen to know what it was exactly that they gave Duke, and do you have a reference? Best, <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> 16:56, Mar 19, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The issues are twofold: Firstly, does the institution have the academic credentials by which its awards would receive international recognition as postgraduate degrees? Secondly, does it have the academic credibility to be treated as a politically-neutral arbiter of the quality of Duke's scholarship? My recommended reference materials are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.iapm.kharkiv.edu/english/about/about_body.html" class="external text" title="http://www.iapm.kharkiv.edu/english/about/about_body.html" rel="nofollow">IAPM English language pages assert capacity to grant 'diplomas'</a></li>
<li>An independent source <a href="http://www.eucen.org/conferences/past/Warsaw1998/ukraina/nextukra.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.eucen.org/conferences/past/Warsaw1998/ukraina/nextukra.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> confirms 'diploma': "It is the largest private higher school of Ukraine with its admission quota more than 1 200 students. In IAMP more than 7 000 students study, it has many branches and regional centres. This private higher school is gradually turning into a Ukrainian analogue of the British Open University. It awards diplomas in eight specialities from the sphere of economy, business, law and psychology on a three-level system - younger specialist (expert), bachelor, master (two, four and six years of training respectively)."</li>
<li>The same source <a href="http://www.eucen.org/conferences/past/Warsaw1998/ukraina/nextukra.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.eucen.org/conferences/past/Warsaw1998/ukraina/nextukra.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> records that 'nostryfication' - achieving equivalence with international standards - is in progress, not yet achieved.</li>
<li>Rector of IAPM is considered a Nazi within Ukraine <a href="http://www.iapm.edu.ua/news/zayava-13-06.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iapm.edu.ua/news/zayava-13-06.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></li>
<li>World Jewish Congress identifies IAPM as main source of anti-Semitic propaganda in Ukraine <a href="http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/anti-semitism/ukraine-pro.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/anti-semitism/ukraine-pro.cfm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></li>
<li>The Ukraine State Committee on Ethics has requested the repeal of the IAPM's existing accreditation <a href="http://www.cjes.ru/bulletin/?bulletin_id=915&amp;lang=eng" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cjes.ru/bulletin/?bulletin_id=915&amp;lang=eng" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></li>
<li>There's some confusion distinguishing the IAPM from the <b>International Personnel Academy</b>, which may turn out to be the body that 'awarded' the 'doctorate' <a href="http://spookspot.blogspot.com/2004_11_28_spookspot_archive.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://spookspot.blogspot.com/2004_11_28_spookspot_archive.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I'm being pedantic here for the simple reason that Duke boosters themselves put emphasis on this honorific to argue that their ideas command rank and respectability in some parts of academia. I think it is wiki's duty to clarify to what extent IAPM is properly thought of as a degree-awarding body. <a href="../../../a/d/h/User%7EAdhib_ade4.html" title="User:Adhib">Adhib</a> 20:32, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for doing all this research. I agree it's important, and you're not being pedantic at all. I'm a little concerned that the word "diploma" was used by the source you link to above simply because of a translation error, as the text does refer to bachelors and masters, which we would normally call degrees; though they may be using the word "diploma" deliberately to signal a lack of accreditation. I'd say you should use your judgment regarding what to call it, as you're the one who has done the research. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> 20:54, Mar 19, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To be frank, I reverted you most recently because I thought it was vandalism. The link addition was <i>that</i> questionable. Trustafarian is a slang term and added absolutely nothing to the article by linking it there. I will generally leave a comment unless I believe an addition to be vandalism or a test. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Quinlan_49be.html" title="User:Daniel Quinlan">Daniel Quinlan</a> 13:38, Mar 26, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmmm. The Trustafarian link made sense in the context of the whacking great paragraph that was also eliminated, I thought. Trustafarian is a popular culture term for aristocrat - both denote a person living on 'independent means' - the interest from property accumulated by their family. Was the paragraph on <i>Aristocracy as a social group</i> merely collateral damage sustained in the squelching of my admittedly populist link, or did you have specific questions about that stuff, as well? <a href="../../../a/d/h/User%7EAdhib_ade4.html" title="User:Adhib">Adhib</a> 16:03, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Either I'm missing something about this system, or it's not a form of <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renewable_energy.html" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a> - it's simply a substitute for aircon, one which uses a bit less energy (presumably - although even that reduction seems not to be quantified - what wattage do the water pumps burn?). Maybe there is a nifty heat exchanger involved that's creating a net power output? But I can't see any reference to that. <a href="../../../a/d/h/User%7EAdhib_ade4.html" title="User:Adhib">Adhib</a> 13:46, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../e/n/e/Energy.html" title="Energy">Energy</a> is defined in the start of its article as: the property ... of changing the state of a <a href="../../../s/y/s/System.html" title="System">system</a> or doing <a href="../../../w/o/r/Work.html" title="Work">work</a>. Later in the article, one can read: how much <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mechanical_work.html" title="Mechanical work">work</a> the system could be made to do, or how much <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heat.html" title="Heat">heat</a> it can exchange.

<dd><a href="../../../e/n/e/Energy.html" title="Energy">Energy</a> measures <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mechanical_work.html" title="Mechanical work">work</a> or <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heat.html" title="Heat">heat</a> exchange; although this technology doesn't <i>generate</i> energy that can do work, water-cooling is a form of heat exchange.</dd>
</dl>
<p>So, assuming my understanding is correct, by definition, exhanging heat <i>is</i> a form of energy. The state of the system <i>is</i> changed.

<dd>Thanks for setting that out. I <i>think</i> my suspicion is confirmed, though I really can't be certain (I'm no thermodynamicist). If work is being performed in the act of heat exchange, it is done by the warm buildings acting to warm the chilled water at the pumphouse. The lake system itself must be drawing electrical energy from the grid (or burning fuel) to drive the pumps that raise water from the lake bed. It makes no contribution to energy <i>supplies</i>, so I'd be reluctant to accept definitions of renewable energy which accommodated it - though it is, of course, substituting for a more inefficient cooling technology, and thus makes energy <i>savings</i> possible. <a href="../../../a/d/h/User%7EAdhib_ade4.html" title="User:Adhib">Adhib</a> 20:01, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, I am relatively new to wikipedia but interested in learning more about the problem of disciplining abusers on public IP blocks such as you describe. Can you point me at a relevant discussion so I can arm myself with the facts? At present, I do not see why repeat abuse from a public IP should not be stopped by blocking anon. edits from that IP. Genuine contributors can sign up. -- <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJdowland_630e.html" title="User:Jdowland">Jon Dowland</a> 29 June 2005 10:51 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm no expert. All I can tell you is that blocking of anon vandals frequently took my access down before I posted these comments, <i>despite</i> my being signed-in. So many people share this ISP in the UK that there was a period back in December when <i>all</i> access was blocked for over a week (I can reboot to get allocated another IP in the 62.255.64.x series by the ISP, but in this case every IP in their series was subject to a block). For all I know, people were mis-applying blocks, ie, blocks which were for some reason not discriminating between anon and signed-up contributors. Or it might be that ntl (the big UK ISP) has some particular way of serving that defies such discrimination using wiki processes. But in any case, it seems to me more constructive to take two minutes to hand serious anon vandals over to their ISP - it's not like you called the cops, and you're far less likely to get repeat offenders from that strategy. <a href="../../../a/d/h/User%7EAdhib_ade4.html" title="User:Adhib">Adhib</a> 10:10, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Adhib, could you move the straw poll on the revision of the article to its own section (by adding an appropriate header)? I sense that the validity of the NPOV tag will continue to be challenged and would like to maintain the thread of that discussion for the sake of clarity. I would make the change myself but I worry that it would be seen by some as an invitation for abuse and example of my 'rampant POV.' and lack of good faith. <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 18:59, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
