<p>Is it possible that a citizen of a rich country adopt a citizen of a poor country in order to enable the latter to move to or stay in the rich country? Is that possible even if the adoptee is an adult? If yes, do the parents of the adoptee have to agree? <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a> 05:44, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>.. <i>Is it possible that a citizen of a rich country adopt a citizen of a poor country in order to enable the latter to move to or stay in the rich country?</i> Well, by it's nature, international adoption involves the movement of minors from 'poor' to 'rich' countries. Staying in the rich country is a byproduct of, rather than the purpose of, the adoption.</p>
<p>.. <i>Is that possible even if the adoptee is an adult?</i> Generally no, as an adoption terminates the parental rights of one set of parents and replaces them with another. Such rights normally terminate with the age of majority.</p>
<p>.. <i>If yes, do the parents of the adoptee have to agree?</i> In most jurisdictions, parental consent to adoption is required except in cases of abandonment, or where neglect has been proven and parental rights have been terminated. In general, therefore, in most jurisdictions, it is not possible to adopt an adult. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastun_82b1.html" title="User:Bastun">Bastun</a> 12:24, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For what it's worth, it appears to be possible to adopt adults in California: <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/01/31/MN37724.DTL" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/01/31/MN37724.DTL" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. While it's true that most <i>parental rights</i> terminate with majority, many of the benefits of children do not, so adult adoption might make sense.</dd>

<dd>And although it isn't possible yet, there's a forthcoming Bill in Ireland (not yet published, so no reference), one part of which will allow those who've been in long-term fostercare to be adopted by their fosterparents (assuming mutual consent), once the person in fostercare reaches 18.

<p>This section still seems a little empty to me. It mentions that there is movement for reform, but doesn't explain what reforms are being introduced or sought. Will work on expanding this over the next while.

<dd>In removing the first paragraph, there's nothing there now to actually explain what 'adoption reform' is.

<p>I have just come across this page for the first time, and I find the section on "Honest Adoption Language" interesting and informative. However, the "Reasons for Preference" column is not NPOV as it stands now. The text in this column states as fact opinions that are clearly controversial. These opinions should all be attributed to the specific people and groups who hold them, or they should be deleted.</p>
<p>I will eventually remove the POV myself, but I wanted to post this message first, because someone familiar with the issue will probably be better able than me to NPOV the text while retaining useful information.</p>

<dd>As you'll see from previous discussions on this talk page, the language surrounding adoption is something of a controversial issue. I'm responsible for the current 'Language of adoption' section as it stands now, after acting as something of an arbiter between various views. The idea here was, in accordance with Wiki policy, to present both sides of the argument as regards HAL and PAL (which itself is not NPOV) and let people make up their own minds. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastun_82b1.html" title="User:Bastun">Bastun</a> 09:45, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're right that the PAL section is also POV. I'm glad that you've worked to present both sides on this. While I still feel that the opinions eventually need to be attributed explicitly to specific groups, I can see that the current situation is better than just presenting one side of the debate. --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 13:02, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okies, I'll look for some attributions when I'm working on the Adoption Reform section (though it's looking unlikely now that I'll get to it this week), rather than just the links to Google-searches for the terms. This section of the page does tend to attract POV edits and vandalism, so it probably needs to be spelt out more clearly that both "sides" <i>are</i> POV and that it's left for the reader to decide on the merits of each view. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastun_82b1.html" title="User:Bastun">Bastun</a> 21:15, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>The external link Adoptionnews.com appears to be new and poorly constructed (many pages are still blank). It seems to be part of the adoption.com/adoption.org/&amp;c. commercial group. Can we delete that external link? I think that linking to adoption.com is sufficient. (The information at adoption.com is itself fragmented, difficult to navigate, and advertiser driven, though there seems to be little indication to casual users that "recommended" links are actually recommended on the basis of advertising fees).</p>

<p>Ok, I may be totally wrong, but I dont see why all the links are needed for the "Adoption" article. There are, in my opinion, far too many. Wouldnt it be better to make a seperate article for international adoption or adoption in Canada or adoption in Asia, etc.....i dont know...it just seems too much. Not to mention that many of the links are biased....so we get into the idea of "pro-adoption" vs "anti-adoption" and I just think that deserves a seperate article.--<a href="../../../o/w/n/User%7EOwnlyanangel_bfd2.html" title="User:Ownlyanangel">Ownlyanangel</a> 00:55, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I wouldn't put them in a separate article, but you're right that there's a problem with spam and bias. Hmm.

<dd>There are separate article for <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adoption_in_the_United_States_fc56.html" title="Adoption in the United States">Adoption in the United States</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_adoption.html" title="International adoption">International adoption</a>. The former is perhaps a good example of what happens when something gets split off into a separate article without too much thought or preparation. I'd support the addition of other country-specific articles (and am working (slowly!) on one). As regards the external links here; they represent a good mixture of government/state agencies, general adoption information sites (probably more useful for people wanting to find out how to go about adopting), post-adoption sites (probably more useful for those interested in tracing, search and reunion), and sites dealing with particular aspects of adoption (e.g., coping with placement, ethical issues, research, societal changes). The sites currently linked to therefore present a good overview of many aspects of adoption from different perspectives. The one absence is links to adoption agencies - there are literally thousands of them so including one over another would be dubious. Best to stick with Wiki policy on advertising and exclude them all. I also support country-specific links. As mentioned several times in the article, laws vary from state to state, country to country. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastun_82b1.html" title="User:Bastun">Bastun</a> 09:40, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am adding sources as I find them. I've already added a comparatively long list of sources. I don't know what you mean by "forum" and "self-published websites". I referenced at least one professional journal, and I am adding more printed literature references. Each reference I included contained professional research, and some of them included further references. At the rate we're going, the references are going it be bigger than the article section. Most of the information I found through adoption organizations. The study you deleted encompasses adopted children as well, and so it's relevant. Yo may not be aware fo it, but abuse is a known ("obvious") problem in adoption circles, so I must insist that the topic be treated, especially considering the mountains of evidence, both anecdotal and scientific. If you'll stop deleting the changes, I'll be able to keep filling in references from my list. Qwasty</dd>

<dd>Please see <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html#Using_online_and_self-published_sources" title="WP:RS">WP:RS#Using_online_and_self-published_sources</a> for an explanation of why web forums and self-published websites are not normally considered reliable sources on Wikipedia. As for the the Pediatrics study, the fact that the study group <i>encompasses</i> adopted children doesn't tell us anything. The trend in abuse could actually be the exact opposite among adopted children, but this could be overwhelmed by trends among the far greater number of non-adopted children living with unrelated adults. Also, the "obviousness" of a problem isn't much of an argument if you can't find reliable sources. --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 14:57, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's more than one study cited, with both of them encompassing adopted children, and I've even excerpted a quote from one of them that specifically addresses adopted children. Once again, I'm not sure what reference you're talking about that's a self published website or a forum. In that article section, reference 10 is a forum link, but that was in the text before I started modifying it. I haven't read it yet, so I don't know anything about it.</dd>

<dd>All studies I have found show between 800% and 6500% increase in risk of death for adopted children. As far as obviousness goes, I'm an adopted person who's frequently feared for his life, and since I have found limitless anecdotal evidence, and plenty of scientific evidence that shows that my experience is not uncommon, I consider abuse and neglect of adopted children an "obvious" problem above and beyond what normal children experience (was adopted-out partly due to abuse, and I was abused FAR worse by my adoptive parents than my natural parents). But, you don't have to take my word for it, just call any organization that deals with adoption and ask them if this issue is a significant concern for them. In short, the idea that adopted children have it as good as normal children is completely wrong, no matter how you look at it - Subjectively, or qualitatively, adopted children are put at vastly higher risk for abuse and death simply by being adopted.</dd>

<dd>I don't mind continually adding references, and I think it's important that I keep doing it since the facts are so shocking and outrageous, especially in the tender context of adoption, which is supposed to be a pure and noble thing. I have seen parents adopting both animals and children, and I have noticed very little difference between the way they are both handled. If potential adoptive parents who read this article become aware of the facts I've added, they'll hopefully avoid adding to the statistics.</dd>

<dd>By way of example: "Some adoptees report that that they were made to feel - consciously or not - as if they should forever 'be grateful' to have been 'chosen'." No problem with this - pretty much any of the current literature goes into it. But then "Even the best adoptive parents sometimes act as if their adopted children should be like loyal and grateful pets, rather than ordinary unruly children." and "Punishments given to misbehaving adopted children can be notoriously harsh, and while natural parents may hate the thought of giving out punishments, adopted parents may punish solely on the perceived ingratitude of their adopted children." are wild assertions. "Natural" parents abuse children too! And some edits, e.g., the part about parents protecting children unto death, apart from being a wild assertion, just aren't legible.</dd>

<dd>Much of what you've quoted is not what I've written. It was there before I began editing, and I cleaned it up and added references. I don't think they're wild assertions though, which is why I've taken the time to cleanup and add references. Everyone is freaking out over these facts, particularly the increased death rates for adopted children. Yes, it's appalling, but it's true. What those figures state is that risk for premature death in adopted people is greatly increased overall, not just from abuse, though abuse is the largest cause of death studied.</dd>

There was a bunch of other related topics covered as well, but I don't know what happened to it since then. Qwasty 01:18, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Qwasty, thank you for providing the citations that you found for the abuse info. I'm still concerned about the subsection above the abuse subsection, though ("Honesty issues").

<p>User:MatthewFenton, please see the External Links section above before removing the links again as to why they are included. You've twice removed links to many sites belonging to State- and State-funded and other <i>major</i> organisations that deal with adoption and post-adoption issues. They are both useful, informative and <i>directly</i> relevant to the article. And adoption laws and practices vary greatly from country to country. I'm actually the editor who added the 'cleanup spam' tag originally - it was needed because links to individual for- and non-profit adoption agencies were being added - there are literally thousands of these. Why would you exclude major organisations working in the field of adoption, such as Origins or Bastard Nation (who've succeeded in having laws changed in six US states!)? <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastun_82b1.html" title="User:Bastun">Bastun</a> 00:51, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nor am I&#160;:-) Do you know is there an alternative tag that would serve better than the 'cleanup spam' tag? Basically what I'm trying to avoid is having hundreds of 'Acme Adoptions Inc. - {insert state} agency doing adoptions from {list of source countries}'. Wikipedia isn't the place for that and there are better alternatives, including sites like adoption.com (which is listed). But at the same time still maintaining links to organisations working with the issue of adoption, whether that be research, advocacy, search and reunion, provision of information, etc. Cheers. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastun_82b1.html" title="User:Bastun">Bastun</a> 09:41, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"<b>Adoption</b> is the legal act of permanently placing a child with a parent or parents other than the birth parents..." makes sense to me.

<p>The external links section has over 30 sites listed. Clearly some of them do not belong. For the moment, I'm hiding the whole section while I peck away at the list to see who fits the criteria:</p>
<p>"Links normally to be avoided Except for a link to a page that is the subject of the article or is an official page of the subject of the article, one should avoid:</p>
<p>Any site that does not provide a unique resource beyond what the article would contain once it becomes a Featured article. Any site that misleads the reader by use of factually inaccurate material or unverifiable research. See Reliable sources. Links mainly intended to promote a website. Links to sites that primarily exist to sell products or services. For example, instead of linking to a commercial bookstore site, use the "ISBN" linking format, giving readers an opportunity to search a wide variety of free and non-free book sources. Links to sites with objectionable amounts of advertising. Links to sites that require payment to view the relevant content. Sites that are inaccessible to a substantial number of users, such as sites that only work with a specific browser. Direct links to documents that require external applications (such as Flash or Java) to view the relevant content, unless the article is about such rich media. If you do link to such material make a note of what application is required. Links to search engine results pages. Links to social networking sites (such as MySpace), discussion forums or USENET. Links to personal websites, including blogs and anonymous websites or webpages, except those allowed by policy (see WP:V) Links to open wikis, except those with a substantial history of stability and a substantial number of editors. Sites that are only indirectly related to the article's subject: it should be a simple exercise to show how the link is directly and symmetrically related to the articles subject. This means that there is both a relation from the website to the subject of the article, and a relation from the subject of the article to the website. For example, the officially sanctioned online site of a rock band has a direct and symmetric relationship to that rock band, and thus should be linked to from the rock band's Wikipedia article. An alternative site run by fans is not symmetrically related to the rock band, as the rock band has only indirect connections with that site." <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html#What_should_be_linked_to" title="Wikipedia:External links">Wikipedia's external links policy</a> <a href="../../../m/d/b/User%7EMdbrownmsw_9056.html" title="User:Mdbrownmsw">Mdbrownmsw</a> 19:22, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>if someone is born in mexico and adopted into an american family, would the person have mexican citizenship or no?</p>
<dl>
<dd>It depends on Mexico's citizenship laws and you would really need to consult a lawyer, but my understanding is that many (not all) countries will grant citizenship to people born in that country. The adopted person would probably need to have a copy of their pre-adoption birth certificate. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastun_82b1.html" title="User:Bastun">Bastun</a> 13:11, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>However, once adopted, the child becomes a citizen of the american family...´If you try to reclaim Mexican citizenship, you may have to renounce American citizenship...many countries do allow dual citizenship...but many others do not <a href="../../../d/p/e/User%7EDPeterson_3157.html" title="User:DPeterson"><font color="red">DPeterson</font></a><sup><a href="../../../d/p/e/User_talk%7EDPeterson_eca1.html" title="User talk:DPeterson">talk</a></sup> 22:17, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The United States apparently does <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_nationality_law#Dual_citizenship" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_nationality_law#Dual_citizenship" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.

<p>I removed the link to the special needs page because that redirects to a very brief article about special education. In this context (adoption) special needs is a much broader concept that includes children with chronic medical issues, mental health problems, behavioral problems, and, in some jurisdictions, it can also include older children and other children that are "difficult" to place. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERalphLender_bfe4.html" title="User:RalphLender"><font color="green">RalphLender</font></a><sup><a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERalphLender_f133.html" title="User talk:RalphLender">talk</a></sup> 18:31, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That reads fine. I'd reverted the previous removal of the link to <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_needs.html" title="Special needs">Special needs</a> (by an anon IP) because it left a sentence hanging with no conclusion. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastun_82b1.html" title="User:Bastun">Bastun</a> 21:50, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
