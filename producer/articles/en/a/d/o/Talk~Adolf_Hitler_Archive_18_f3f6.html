<p>"The question stands: why the blanket interest in Hitler, when Stalin merits as much, if not more? Isn't it a pretence to insist that the Hitler obsession has anything to do with moral reflection and lesson-learning?--<a href="../../../s/h/t/User%7EShtove_8f32.html" title="User:Shtove">shtove</a> 00:21, 11 November 2005 (UTC)".--<a href="../../../s/h/t/User%7EShtove_8f32.html" title="User:Shtove">shtove</a> 01:34, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's to do with how history is taught in school and how it's passed down. In Britain, history focuses largely on the world wars, throughout mandatory lessons and GCSE (I'm not so sure about A level). I don't know what is said about in other countries since I'm from Britain. Also, since Russia aided the allies in the 2nd World War, Stalin is inevitably ignored in the multitude of documentaries that have been made about it, since these documentaries are made by the countries that won, and so focus on the losers. Because of this, most people when asked about the 2nd World War will think of Hitler, even if they know very little about it (e.g young children), since he has been the most televised dictator from recent times. Even people with little interest in the 2nd World War know a lot about Hitler because of the mass of information about him. If teaching about Stalin was widespread throughout history lessons and the general public then I'm sure that people would talk about his 'atrocities' just as much. However, this hasn't happened because Stalin's actions were very self-contained, and kept within Russia, whilst Hitler's were committed at a time when most of the world had an interest or involvement with Germany. As such, we have an interest in things that involved us, and teach them in history. Stalin's actions did not involve us, and so draw less interest. it sounds very cold-hearted, but humans tend to have little time for learning about things that do not, or did not ever involve them to any great degree.Humpelfluch</dd>
</dl>
<p>Your points are sound, but not all GCSE pupils or tv-viewers are interested in Hitler, and I daresay a few of them are more interested in Stalin. What I'm getting at is the obsession we have. My view is that Hitler is our chosen cipher for evil - absent God - and that the soap-opera of his life gives the cipher mass appeal. As for the self-contained nature of Stalin's actions - state communism set out to dominate the world and human nature: far more pernicious than Germany's cobbled together ideology. I wonder what Ukrainians and Poles would think of the obsession?--<a href="../../../s/h/t/User%7EShtove_8f32.html" title="User:Shtove">shtove</a> 22:12, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Excuse me, but from what I see in the Hitler/Nazi Wikipedia presentation, here the cipher of evil is <i>underplayed</i>. His personal and rock hard, never changed and clear program is very hard to find, and completely un-linked as I question below. Sorry , temerity to interject but...<a href="../../../e/f/f/User%7EEffK_b5e6.html" title="User:EffK">EffK</a></dd>

</dd>
<dd>That is true, but the fact remains that there are far more documentaries about Hitler than Stalin, since the 2nd World War was bigger and affected more countries than Stalin did. For this reason the average person knows more about what Hitler did than Stalin, and this may not be throught choice or interest, but simply because what Hitler did is focused on so much more than Stalin. I've given a reason or two above for why this is so, but I don't know for certain why, all I know is that we do focus more on Hitler, and because of this the vast majority of people know of the Holocaust, but not as many will know of Stalin's atrocities. And so when we talk about great evil, Hitler is what a lot of people will think of. It may also be due to the fact that a lot of Jews survived the concentration camps and were able to talk about it, and the allies saw these camps and were able to talk about them. Less people survived what Stalin did, so less people could talk about it or have first hand experience of it.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>As for state-communism, it may have set out to take over the world, but it wasn't as involved with us as Hitler's plans. Germany invaded, Russia did not. Germany basically atempted to put forward their views and dragged the world into it, while Russia may have had the plans and intention, but were not so loud about it, so less people knew, and still now, less people know about state communism than Nazism, again because Nazism affected so many more people than Russian communism. Russian communism affected the people in the country, but Nazism affected the country, and every country they invaded and fought against.Humpelfluch 15:08, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Obviously, the only people who have valid insight on this matter are Germans who deal with problems stemming from Hitler to this day. [/sarcasm]. Seriously, you have to realize that wherever you grew up, there's a lot of bias on these matters. America is so concerned about Hitler because the war was a big thing for our (I'm American) contry, and it's essentially run right over the effect Stalin had, and if anything, Americans generally feel that Stalin's acts were just paving the way for a Hitler figure (I'm being overly brief, but you get the idea). That's why we, as a nation, tend to focus on Hitler more than Stalin. And last I checked, the US was still one of the biggest Wiki contributors to the English pages, so that influence appears here. It's a simple formula, really. If this were a primarily Russian site (or the wiki for a Russian-area language), I imagine Stalin would be getting a lot more fervor than Hitler. So it is with Mussolini and Italy. [User calderra is logged out]</dd>

<dd>Did Hitler kill each and every Holocaust victim personally, by hand, with help from no one else? I'd imagine that's why.

<dd>I think he was not a Christian. He was well aware that could not publicly condemn (or contradict) Christianity because that would be devastating to his popularity. Only (difficult to verify) private discussions can serve as evidence in this matter. He even stopped the T4 euthanasia programme under pressure from the churches. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 23:34, 13 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>These quotes do appear to be verifiable. If someone announces publically that he is so-and-so, this - the act of <i>announcement</i> - is an undeniable fact, and is independent from discussions related to an <i>evaluation</i> of the validity of the announcement; the phrase "Hitler claimed to be a 'Christian'" holds true even if he was among the least-Christian people who ever lived. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShawnc_13f4.html" title="User:Shawnc">Shawnc</a> 15:43, 14 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Then write something like "In his public discourses, before the elections he claimed to be a Christian.". There is documented evidence that there were two professions that he hated i.e. the priest and the lawyer. (I forgot where I read this).

<p>I agree with Andries. Though Hitler was not an esotoricist as Himmler or Heß, he neither was a Christian. Hitler was born into a Catholic family, but from his youth onward didn't practice the faith in any way. He never went to church, except for weddings of people like Göring or funerals. He did not "discuss his faith" but made religious reference in his speeches - that's quite different. References to God do not make one a Christian. In fact, it is known that he wanted to erradicate Christianity after the "Endsieg". Any references to Christianity must also be seen in light of the NSDAP's "positive Christianity" which basically means a shell to be filled by Nazi ideas. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 22:34, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Finally somebody who <s>dis</s>agrees with me on something. That is rare lately.&#160;:)Yes, I saw on German TV (ZDF?) a testimony by a Catholic SS-man who stated that Hitler more or les privately told him that he wanted to eradicate Christianity after the Final Victory (Endsieg). He could not do that when the war was not won because he needed the support of the people. I do not have the details though. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 13:01, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I consider his analyses of Hitler's life and thoughts authorative. He did not write a chronological well-referenced biography, like Kershaw. Can somebody please check if and where Haffner wrote this.

<dd>I think we can delete it now (and also it's sub category:Nazi war criminal). According to the vote 5 want to delete it and only 2 to keep. --<a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHaham_hanuka_7d7e.html" title="User:Haham hanuka">Haham hanuka</a> 13:45, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I agree that the subcategory is a bit questionable. Whether he belongs into "War criminal" category is a matter of definition of that category: he certainly didn't commit any war crimes himself, but he did order some (e.g. through the <i>Kommissarbefehl</i>). <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 13:50, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>but it is a PoV. If I think that George Bush is a war criminal, Can I add it to this category? --<a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHaham_hanuka_7d7e.html" title="User:Haham hanuka">Haham hanuka</a> 13:55, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>No, Haham, it is only a POV insofar everything is a POV. If Bush was seriously (!!) charged or even convicted or had escaped charge or conviction via death or other means while evidence of his guilt were avaiable then you could include Bush. But that is not the case. Some want to include Bush for crimes committed by subalterns - I don't, unless they'd have evidence of his involvement (via orders etc.). Anyway, Bush is alive. Hitler is dead, was dead (and hence never charged) but the historiographical evidence "convicts" him. Though history is no law court, it presents evidence of what someone has done. That's not POV, as there's no serious debate over what he has done. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 14:06, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was earlier objecting to the neutralising of the specificity of this Title for the Hitler bankers who kept his movement afloat, down to german businessmen. now I see that the vote for deletion was carried by <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_McClenon_acae.html" title="User:Robert McClenon">Robert McClenon</a> and one other. this seems exrtraordinary, especially as the info was sourced to the very page . What exactly does this contribute to Wkipedia, and why do we sleep walk along into this kind of revisionism in WP&#160;? I can only say that I am appalled at the approach being forced hrough here and in many related articles. This is sabotage of a high order and denies <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verifiability.html" title="Verifiability">verifiability</a>. <a href="../../../e/f/f/User%7EEffK_b5e6.html" title="User:EffK">EffK</a> 10:06, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Does the administrator of this Wikipedia still live within the world of the magazine "Mad"&#160;? He seems to be not so qualified for this job. He seems to be a "Wikipedia administrator". Hans Rosenthal (ROHA) (hans.rosenthal AT t-online.de -- ersetze AT durch @ ) (19012006)</p>
