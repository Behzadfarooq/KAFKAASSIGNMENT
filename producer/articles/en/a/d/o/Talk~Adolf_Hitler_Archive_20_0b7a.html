<h2><span class="mw-headline">CIA?</span></h2>
<p>This is already in the archives but first, the CIA didn't even exist until after AH was dead. Second, the OSS collected all sorts of raw allegations and stories about AH for ten years, much of it provided by refugees who had much to gain by telling US intelligence spooks what they thought they wanted to hear. Over the past year, some journalists and authors, looking for fresh roadkill to sell in airport bookstores, have dredged up some of the old tall tales and published them without a hint of scholarship or academic context. There is no verifiable evidence AH was beaten into being a sociopath by Alois and the story about him having been beaten nearly to death has but one dodgy, unqualified source and has no basis in the documented record. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 07:50, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd been puzzling about that section myself. The question of Hitler's "mental or physical illnesses" is a serious topic which should, and I think does, have its own article. At best, this could be included in there as one piece of speculation. But it reeked of outdated war-time propaganda. These days, it is very rare to hear psychoanalytic theoris about the brutalization of AH by his father, double-bind theories, etc.. --<a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacatosias_a9d0.html" title="User:Lacatosias">Lacatosias</a> 08:54, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Most scholars are circumspect enough to acknowledge that diagnosing AH according to DSM standards from the historical record is impossible. On a talk page it's no problem to say most of us would consider him "crazy" or "lunatic" one way or another but it's best to let that emerge through his documented actions and effect on Europe (tens of millions of innocents dead etc etc). The term <i>sociopath</i> is generally supported, but getting into rambling, often fabricated tales about his childhood or sexual habits based only on hearsay picked up by the OSS from people who loathed him (and usually had something to gain) will only make the reader think it's easy to spot genocidal maniacs and it's not. I'm simplifying here but even his opposition didn't realize how nuts he was until it was too late, while by 1944 the majority of high ranking Germans and industrial leaders seem to have been privately acknowledging, one way or another, that he was "mad." <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 16:10, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Were any muslims killed during the holocaust? Surely Hitler would have found them to be undesirable, just like he did the Jews, homosexuals, and communists. Yet I can't find any references to muslims during the holocaust. Davez621 09:09, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Very simplified answer: The Turks (who were major German allies during the Great War) and most Arab countries were nominally Axis allies or neutral throughout the 1939-45 war and the Turkish population of Germany was nominal. Moreover, the open anti-semitism of many (but not all) Arab leaders made diplomacy with Berlin somewhat easier. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 15:40, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Nazis of the 1930's can not be compared to the simple gutter racists of today. They didn't think that just because someone was not white that made him racially inferior. Himmler invited Muslim religious leaders to Berlin on several occasions and Arabs hoped Nazi Germany would thwart Jewish plans to return to what was then Palestine. Nazi racial theorists believed that Germans are racially related to Tibetans, Indians and the Japanese. To prove this the SS organised expeditions to Tibet and tried to suggest a link between runes and Japanese script. There were even purely Indian divisions in the Waffen-SS who believed they were helping to liberate their country from the hated British occupying forces. This dubious past has led Germans to be liked and even revered (almost against their will!) in parts of Northern Africa, the Middle East, India and Japan to this day. There was even a controversy in India 1-2 years ago when an Indian school book described Hitler as a great man who had done many good things for his country. There's plenty more to read up on bizarre Nazi racial theories...</p>

<p>Dear Lacatosias, I have been involved in other issues therefore my "absence" from this article. EffK is banned or about to be banned. As for ROHA (Hans Rosenthal), he posts interventions once in a while, mainly to protest against the current photo of Hitler at the top of the article. I don't think it's against AGF to say that he doesn't register so that he cannot be blocked. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 18:32, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Incarnation of evil</span></h2>
<p>Ok, yeah, I guess he was for most folks who would express the notion in those terms. However, it's an op-ed, fuzzy sort of thing to say with quasi religious ramifications. If someone can come up with a citation from a major AH biographer or other qualified, peer-reviewed historian who makes a statement along the lines that AH "is considered by most to be an incarnation of evil" or something similar, I'd say it's ok to include it. Until then, without a solid, attributed cite, it's not encyclopedic, however true. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 18:39, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think the phrase "incarnation of evil" is a bit over the top, but I don't think cites are necessary for generally held opinions that it would be hard <b>not to find</b> a consensus for. Perhaps the wording can be changed to something like: "in popular discourse, figures like Hitler and Stalin are often cited as examples of evil". -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 00:43, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>With all due respect, I'm not sure popular discourse is a helpful thing to cite here. Anyway the word <i>evil</i> is already used in the closing paragraph. By the bye, a Russian once said to me, "Hitler was horrible, but at least he thought he was saving the world. Stalin had no such illusions. He was evil." <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 00:48, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think much of the word "evil" as it's too connotative of specific religious beliefs, so I don't care whether it's included or not. My point is that not every phrase in an article requires "a suitable citation in a secondary source by a peer-reviewed author" - for instance, articles by (perhaps less conscientious) editors of pop music biographies frequently talk about popular judgements without citations which are in any case meaningless, given the subject. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 01:01, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, we agree more or less about the word <i>evil.</i> However, we don't agree on citations. Anything in the article should be supportable, that's WP policy. If you assert something and can't back it up with a verifiable secondary source, it can be removed. WP's role is not to tell the world AH was evil. Most people can glark that on their own, by the bye and many are likely to interpret the article as biased and unreliable if it sums up the "Darth Vader" aspect of AH's legacy too neatly. AH was not a comic book character, which is one of the reasons he managed to cause so much damage. WP's role is to summarize his biography from peer-reviewed sources. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 01:11, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wyss, we do agree on citations, it's just that we don't agree on the interpretation of what requires a citation; all I'm saying is that not everything is citable according to stringent standards, but can be considered a fact of experience and therefore deserves mention. It's like calling a certain landscape beautiful, or to use an imagined quote, "Bavaria is widely considered one of the most beautiful regions in Germany" - where you are going to find a scholarly peer-reviewed source for that, not to mention that not everything that turns up in scholarly sources isn't worth equal weight due to innumerable questions of methodology, bias, etc? -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 01:25, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yeah, the hitch is that Hitler isn't Bavarian scenery. The header of this high traffic article about one of the world's most emotion provoking subjects must be written to the strictest possible, objective, scholarly and encyclopedic standards. I mean, sure, AH was fuckin' evil, but the moment the article asserts that, its scholarly credibility is chaveled and many readers will assume the rest of its content is equally moralizing and weak on supportable, specific history. The use of words like "brutal," "evil" and "violent" in an intro also imply strong emotion which in itself erodes credibility to nil among cautious and educated readers. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 01:32, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<p>Yet you restored the word "violent" to the intro. Hey, in truth we're not that far off in our takes on this. My concern is establishing a credible tone in the header. The article does a great job of representing the documented record, in which he rather starkly emerges as a murderous sociopath (he was responsible for the deaths of even more Germans than Jews by the way, which is not to in any way diminish the horrors and utter moral bankruptcy of the Holocaust). So far as his racial beliefs go, he did stir up the thugs with Jew baiting but most middle class Germans were far more afraid of communism, anarchy and hyper-inflation. Further, there's no evidence Hindenberg would have appointed him chancellor if he'd known the camps would be a result, never mind Germany in ruins by 1945. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 01:57, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, you did not understand the issue: I don't care much for the word "evil" and its connotations, only about citations in gray areas, and this is a gray area that isn't important. On the other hand, Hitler's anti-Semitism and his use of violence are NOT gray areas, they ARE significant aspects of Hitler's popularity (both within his party and among the public) and rule, they are VERY well documented, your own "sources" back this up, he was not responsible for the SYSTEMATIC deaths of more "ordinary" Germans than Jews/Communists, the use of violence went well beyond merely "Jew baiting", and all the scholarly works I cited above go into GREAT detail about both these aspects of Nazism, in fact you could say <i>Nazi Germany and the Jews</i>, which only covers the period from 1933-1939 by the way - ie BEFORE the war - is about this subject only. You're just wrong on this and if you look up the books I mention (which are just ones I own by the way, there must be several others), you'll understand. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 02:27, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

My question here is: Why do you like the picture that is currently in the heading? And why do you not like the picture | colspan="2" align="center" |</p>

<p><a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> said: "ROHA, das ist eine Uniform der Grausigkeit, nicht Ruhm." And I answer: Did you mean that the uniform that Hitler wears in the current leading picture is a "Uniform der Grausigkeit" or did you mean that the current Hitler pic is a "grausiges Beispiel für einen schlechten Wikipedia-Artikel zum Thema Adolf Hitler"&#160;?

<p>ROHA,</p>
<ul>
<li>first of all it was you who went against all consensus and unilaterally kept on inserting what you thougt a better picture. That is wrong regardless of whether you were right or wrong in your argument.</li>
<li>the current picture is, IMO, better since it tells us more about Hitler's self-image then your picture does.</li>
<li>your picture is no less a propaganda photo.</li>

<p>Okay, <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a>, so lets find a compromise: If both of the candidate photographs are propaganda photos, so why should we not chose the one that looks a little bit less propagandistically&#160;? The other candidate could be placed somewhere else in the article.

<p>ROHA, IMO the "uniform" photo is better as it also contains information about how Hitler saw himself and how he was seen most of the time. There is no "less propagandistically", as your photo probably was meant to convey a different propagandistic message at a different occasion. You picture can also be placed somewhere else. I don't care about the pixels very much. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 10:01, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">For the sake of some certain readers and contributors</span></h2>
<p>There was a contributor named "Lacatosias" who said the following:</p>
<p>"(No, that's backward. You do not put the German term in parens unless you are addressing a German audience. Parens are used to clarify. If anything, it should be the other way 'round.") I could not answer at the appropriate place, since it was blocked. But I am glad to answer here: You, Lacatosias, claim that "You do not put the German term in parens unless you are addressing a German audience". And I simply answer: What I added was to explain to an English-speaking audiance what the acronym "NSDAP" means. (Since this acronym NSDAP of a German name: "National..." and so on is still in the introduction of this article, I think my intention was a good one.) Not so&#160;? Now, if not so, then please delete the useless "(NSDAP)", since it will not give any additional information. Hans Rosenthal (ROHA) hans.rosenthal AT t-online.de -- replace AT by @ ) (01022006)</p>

<p>Roha, don't be too hard ton Lacatosias. He deleted it all and I restored the acronym, as it might be useful to use that acronym in the article.

<p>I'm going to put here a POV tag, and this is not just about the intro. Look at the entery about Hitler on Columbia encyclopedia <a href="http://education.yahoo.com/reference/encyclopedia/entry/Hitler-A" class="external autonumber" title="http://education.yahoo.com/reference/encyclopedia/entry/Hitler-A" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and learn how the write an article clean of points of view. The "six million myth" does not appear there and this is all of text related to the holocaust appears there:</p>
<p>" <i>As the tide of war turned against Hitler, his mass extermination of the Jews, overseen by Adolf Eichmann, was accelerated, and he gave increasing power to Heinrich Himmler and the dread secret police, the Gestapo and SS (Schutzstaffel).</i>"</p>
<p>I think we should write more than this here but not to present him as an anti-hero from children's cartoon. --<a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHaham_hanuka_7d7e.html" title="User:Haham hanuka">Haham hanuka</a> 14:22, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is entertaining though, you have to admit.
