<p>I have added descriptions for some of the tools, but am not done yet. I have put an hour of work into this, and plan to spend more in the coming days. I added more information, and added a screencap of the toolbar.</p>
<p>I would like to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create images of the tool icons to put beside their descriptions</li>
<li>Finish listing all the tools and their functions</li>
<li>Talk about other panels besides the tool panel</li>
<li>Add a section for useful extensions, or perhaps simply a series of links</li>
<li>Work on creating a graphical digram of the hierarchy of the toolbar to replace the current screenshot of the toolbar which isn't as helpful as my proposed diagram would be.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fireworks has a very loyal following and while it's a much smaller player in the market, it offers some highly effective workflow advantages over its larger competitors. Some of these include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vector Masking</li>
<li>Transparency exporting</li>
<li>Integration with Flash</li>
<li>Object selection</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not sure if you wanted to include a section on why this program is so popular with professionals.</p>
<hr />
<p>I've reverted the second paragraph to a version more in line with NPOV guidelines. Here's the previous version: <i>Fireworks is similar in purpose to the popular Adobe Photoshop, and offers much more range and sophistication than does the latter. Photoshop has a habit of being intensely uncustomizable - making it a developer's worst enemy. With the release of Macromedia Studio 8, Fireworks improves its advantage over Adobe Photoshop. Fireworks is a primarily vector-based program, whereas Photoshop is stuck in the world of bitmap editing.</i></p>

<p>I reverted the last edit because</p>
<p>1) Fireworks is not "king over Photoshop", and implying that it is by saying that "more and more experienced graphic designers" see it that way is misleading and not factual. How many is "more and more", and what constitutes "experienced"? In my 10 years as a graphic designer, I can say with confidence that Fireworks may be useful, and may even be better than Photoshop in some ways, but is certainly not king over Photoshop.</p>
<p>2) Bitmaps suffer roughly the same reduction in quality no matter which program they're resized in. In fact, Photoshop offers 5 varieties of interpolation for upwards resizing, minimizing the loss of quality compared to most programs. Implying that Fireworks can resize images better than Photoshop is misleading - they both handle bitmaps and vector images the same way.</p>
<p><i>Response:</i> However, FW is much more capable of vector processing and development - along with the bitmap end of the spectrum.</p>
<p>3) Photoshop has greatly expanded its vector capabilities since Fireworks was first released.</p>
<p><i>Response:</i> "expanded" - Yes, expanded, BUT improved over Fireworks?? ... no</p>
<p>4) Most designers use Photoshop in conjunction with other graphics programs, such as Illustrator. Comparing Fireworks to Photoshop is therefore somewhat inaccurate. However, most designers I know, if forced to choose just one graphics editing program, would go with Photoshop.</p>
<p><i>Response:</i> Fireworks is like Photoshop and Illustrator bundled into a single program - a program that has the features of PS and Illustrator but does it better.</p>
<p>5) On what basis do you make the statement that if Adobe merges the two products, the end result will "boast the fireworks core"? This seems like blatant speculation to me.</p>
<p><i>Response:</i> As does your prognosis. I merely state that, due to the great and ever-increasing power and versatility of Fireworks, the combination (if it comes to that) will likely contain much of the Fireworks core data engine.</p>

<p>I just realized that it makes more sense to compare Fireworks to Imageready, not Photoshop. After all, Fireworks is specifically for web graphics, just like ImageReady.

<p>My apologies - there are some responsed in the NPOV discussion, which I missed because they're mixed in with the original post. Let me fix that first and then address the response. <a href="../../../r/a/s/User%7ERasi2290_24fb.html" title="User:Rasi2290">Rasi2290</a></p>
<p>Ok, now that I've made clear what was in my original post and what was in the response...my responses follow.</p>
<p>1) Fireworks is not "king over Photoshop", and implying that it is by saying that "more and more experienced graphic designers" see it that way is misleading and not factual. How many is "more and more", and what constitutes "experienced"? In my 10 years as a graphic designer, I can say with confidence that Fireworks may be useful, and may even be better than Photoshop in some ways, but is certainly not king over Photoshop. <a href="../../../r/a/s/User%7ERasi2290_24fb.html" title="User:Rasi2290">Rasi2290</a></p>
<p>Since you haven't disputed this, I trust you agree? <a href="../../../r/a/s/User%7ERasi2290_24fb.html" title="User:Rasi2290">Rasi2290</a></p>
<p>2) Bitmaps suffer roughly the same reduction in quality no matter which program they're resized in. In fact, Photoshop offers 5 varieties of interpolation for upwards resizing, minimizing the loss of quality compared to most programs. Implying that Fireworks can resize images better than Photoshop is misleading - they both handle bitmaps and vector images the same way. <a href="../../../r/a/s/User%7ERasi2290_24fb.html" title="User:Rasi2290">Rasi2290</a></p>
<p><i>Response:</i> However, FW is much more capable of vector processing and development - along with the bitmap end of the spectrum.</p>
<p>Agreed, Fireworks is better than Photoshop or Imageready for handing vectors. But that's not what you were saying. You were saying that Fireworks is better for resizing ALL graphics, which isn't true at all. Resized bitmaps suffer a similar reduction in quality in either program. Vectors can be resized in either program with no quality difference. If you want to make the point that Fireworks is better at handling vectors overall, I agree with you, but that's a totally seperate point. <a href="../../../r/a/s/User%7ERasi2290_24fb.html" title="User:Rasi2290">Rasi2290</a></p>
<p>3) Photoshop has greatly expanded its vector capabilities since Fireworks was first released. <a href="../../../r/a/s/User%7ERasi2290_24fb.html" title="User:Rasi2290">Rasi2290</a></p>
<p><i>Response:</i> "expanded" - Yes, expanded, BUT improved over Fireworks?? ... no</p>
<p>In your original article you implied that photoshop was totally incapable of handling vector graphics. While this was true at one point, it no longer is. Simple vectors can be created in photoshop, more complex ones can be imported from Illustrator. <a href="../../../r/a/s/User%7ERasi2290_24fb.html" title="User:Rasi2290">Rasi2290</a></p>
<p>4) Most designers use Photoshop in conjunction with other graphics programs, such as Illustrator. Comparing Fireworks to Photoshop is therefore somewhat inaccurate. However, most designers I know, if forced to choose just one graphics editing program, would go with Photoshop. <a href="../../../r/a/s/User%7ERasi2290_24fb.html" title="User:Rasi2290">Rasi2290</a></p>
<p><i>Response:</i> Fireworks is like Photoshop and Illustrator bundled into a single program - a program that has the features of PS and Illustrator but does it better.</p>
<p>Clarification: it's like a WEB version of those two programs bundled together. Photoshop and Illustrator were both designed for print graphics, and combined, they are far more powerful than Fireworks alone. This is why I think it makes no sense to compare Fireworks with Photoshop in the first place. Fireworks is for web graphics, so it should be compared to the web graphics version of Photoshop...which is Imageready. And in that context, I already granted that it's overall better than Imageready. Not Photoshop. <a href="../../../r/a/s/User%7ERasi2290_24fb.html" title="User:Rasi2290">Rasi2290</a></p>
<p>5) On what basis do you make the statement that if Adobe merges the two products, the end result will "boast the fireworks core"? This seems like blatant speculation to me. <a href="../../../r/a/s/User%7ERasi2290_24fb.html" title="User:Rasi2290">Rasi2290</a></p>
<p><i>Response:</i> As does your prognosis. I merely state that, due to the great and ever-increasing power and versatility of Fireworks, the combination (if it comes to that) will likely contain much of the Fireworks core data engine.</p>
<p>My prognosis was similar as yours - with a few major differences. First, I was talking about it merging with ImageReady; again, this makes more sense than comparing it to Photoshop. Secondly, I made it more clear that nobody knows right now, and we're all speculating on this. And thirdly, I was more specific in what I think would happen. "Boast the Fireworks core" is sort of vague. If you mean that Adobe would start using the Macromedia interface, I assure you that will never, ever happen. Adobe has invested HUGE time and money into establishing their interface across all their programs, and people like it the way it is. If you mean that common operations will work differently - they'll work the 'macromedia' way instead of the 'adobe' way, again, that will never happen. If, however, you mean that Adobe will incorporate Fireworks' features into Imageready and/or PHotoshop, I agree completely.</p>
<p>I'm not even sure if this kind of speculation belongs in a wikipedia article, but if it does, it should be clear that it is exactly that.<a href="../../../r/a/s/User%7ERasi2290_24fb.html" title="User:Rasi2290">Rasi2290</a></p>
<p>I do agree with Rasi2290 here - perhaps it should be made clear that this is purely speculation. Good point. (MLS)</p>
