<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Hitler Putsch" is the German name</span></h2>
<p>In English it's called the "Beer Hall Putsch". The Germans call it the Hitlerputsch. 217.245.8.95 08:18, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sounds reasonable. Should we get someone in to make that change for us? <a href="../../../a/g/a/User%7EAgathoclea_2154.html" title="User:Agathoclea">Agathoclea</a> 12:55, 30 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Let native speakers decide.</dd>
<dd>A bit of historical detail: at first, immediately after the event, it was called the "Hitler-Ludendorff-Putsch", since Ludendorff was both the figurehead and the most prominent leader, while Hitler had been a merely local celebrity. It was this coup and the subsequent trial that propelled Hitler to national prominence, so much that later Ludendorff was dropped from the name of the event alltogether. "Hitlerputsch" certainly gives a more accurate description, as Hitler was the moving force of the attempt after Kahr, Lossow and Seisser (representing government, military and police) had withdrawn their support.</dd>
<dd>But again, current usage should decide which term to use, so "native speakers to the front!"<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 13:49, 31 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>A word from a native speaker: I have never heard someone say "Hitler-Ludendorff-Putsch" - that expression might be found in history books where the author goes to extra lengths to sound reputable, but pretty much anyone would either use "Hitlerputsch" or alternatively "Marsch auf die Feldherrnhalle", which is the event's name as I learned it back in school (mid/late eighties). The "Putsch" name was not used while I was in school - as our history teacher explained, calling it a "putsch" would imply a successful attempt to overthrow the state, and it would then be necessary to call it "attempted Hitlerputsch" or something to remain accurate which would be unnecessarily complicated, so the more neutral "Marsch..." was used. From my reading, it seems that "Hitlerputsch" is used by a number of historians, and people will definitely understand the term. For what it's worth, the article on de.wikipedia resides at <a href="../../../../de/h/i/t/Hitlerputsch.html" class="extiw" title="de:Hitlerputsch">de:Hitlerputsch</a> -- <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFerkelparade_da80.html" title="User:Ferkelparade">Ferkelparade</a> <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFerkelparade_2c87.html" title="User talk:Ferkelparade">π</a> 14:04, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Ferkelparade, am I right in supposing that you are German. So am I. With "native speaker" I was addressing the native speakers of English, whose usage should determine the term to use. I agree that Hitler-Ludendorff-Putsch is used very rarely, for the reasons given above. "Putsch" however doesn't necessarily denote success. In the vast majority of cases, simply "Hitlerputsch" is used without explicitely saying that it failed. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 14:13, 31 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Oh, I see. I assmued you were looking for native Germans to decide current usage in German&#160;:P You're probably right that "putsch" does not necessarily imply success, I only repeated what I was taught in school (and what seemed quite reasonable back then). Meanwhile, I am so used to the term "Marsch auf die Feldherrnhalle" that I actually have to spend a couple seconds of thinking before I realize what is meant by "Hitlerputsch" when I hear the term -- <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFerkelparade_da80.html" title="User:Ferkelparade">Ferkelparade</a> <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFerkelparade_2c87.html" title="User talk:Ferkelparade">π</a> 14:18, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Where are the English native speakers with knowledge in this? <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 16:19, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>What is the question, exactly? In English we always call it the "Beer Hall Putsch." Is there some dispute about this? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 16:42, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>That is the question: by which name is the event most commonly referred to among English speaking historians and writers. Some (see above) suggested to change it to Hitlerputsch. This is the common German term, but I as a German cannot vouch for English usage. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 16:53, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>But the original person didn't say that we should change it, just said that Hitlerputsch is the German name (while also noting that "Beer Hall Putsch" is the English name). Then Agathoclea suggested that someone "make that change," even though nobody had yet explicitly suggested a change. At any rate, you don't need me to tell you that "Beer Hall Putsch" is the English name - has that ever been in doubt? We should use the English name, I think. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 17:17, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>It possibly was suggested earlier, now in the archives. Anyway, I don't mind either way and will not pursue the issue further. I just felt that no reply had been given by an English speaker. You, John, now have closed the gap. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 17:23, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I would have been bold enaugh at the time to make the change, but the article was protected at the time, so I solicited consensus which would allow an admin to do the change.

<p><b>"By then, Hitler's racial policies had culminated in the genocide of 11 million people, including about six million Jews, in what is now known as The Holocaust."</b></p>
<p>my suggest is to change it to:</p>
<p><b>"By then, Hitler's racial policies culminated in a genocide which most of his victims were Jews. This genocide now known as The Holocaust."</b></p>
<p>What can we learn about Hitler from the fact that X and not Y million people died in the genocide. Why does the number of other genocides does not mentioned in any into of other dictators who lead them.</p>
<p>I have looked on Adolf Hitler on servel encyclopedias and those numbers do not appear in the all article. (not just in the intro).</p>

<dd>I looked it up. This information is embarrassingly incorrect. The <b>Encyclopedia Britannica</b> writes: <i>Although Catholics, Poles, homosexuals, Roma (Gypsies), and the handicapped were targeted for persecution, if not outright extermination, the Jews of Germany, Poland, and the Soviet Union were by far the most numerous among the victims; in German-occupied Europe some 6,000,000 Jews were killed during the war. The sufferings of other peoples were only less when measured in their numbers killed.</i> <b>Encarta</b> writes: <i>Because the Allies halted Germany's forces, Hitler's global ambitions were not realized; however, of the approximately 18 million Jews in the world, one-third were killed in what came to be known as the Holocaust. The great majority of European Jews perished, a fact that Hitler boasted of in his last testament.</i></dd>

<p>According to William L. Shirer in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rise_and_Fall_of_the_Third_Reich_619a.html" title="The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich">The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich</a></i>:</p>
<p>"On March 19, 1945 Hitler issued a general order that all military, industrial, transportation and communication installations as well as all stores in Germany must be destroyed in order to prevent them from falling intact into the hands of the enemy. The measures were to be carried out by the military with the help of the Nazi gauletiers and "commissars for defense." "All directives opposing this," the order concluded, "are invalid."</p>
<p>Germany was to be made one vast wasteland. Nothing was to be left with which the German people might somehow survive their defeat.</p>
<p>Hitler told Albert Speer, the Minister for Armament and War Production:</p>
<p><i>If the war is lost, the nation will also perish. This fate is inevitable. There is no necessity to take into consideration the basis for which the people will need to continue a most primitive existence. On the contrary, it will be better to destroy these things ourselves because this nation will have proved to be the weaker one and the future will belong solely to the stronger eastern nation [Russia]. Besides, those who will remain after the battle are only the inferior ones, for the good ones have been killed.</i></p>
<p>This "scorched earth" directive was followed the next day, on March 23 by an order by Martin Bormann, the Fuehrer's secretary. Speer described it on the stand at Nuremberg: "The Bormann decree aimed at bringing the population to the center of the Reich from both East and West, and the foreign workers and prisoners of war were to be included. These millions of people were to be sent upon their trek on foot. No provisions for their existence had been made, nor could it be carried out in view of the situation. It would have resulted in an unimaginable hunger catastrophe.</p>
<p>And had all the other orders of Hitler and Bormann -- there were a number of supplementary directives -- been carried out, millions of Germans who had escaped with their lives up to then might well have died. Speer tried to summarize for the Nuremberg court the various "scorched earth" orders. To be destroyed he said were:</p>
<p><i>"all industrial plants, all important electrical facilities, water works, gas works, food stores and clothing stores; all bridges, all railway and communication installations, all waterways, all ships, all freight cars and all locomotives.</i></p>
<p>That the German people were spared this final catastrophe was due to -- aside from the rapid advances of the Allied troops, which made the carrying out of such a gigantic demolition impossible -- the superhuman efforts of Speer and a number of Army officers who, in direct disobedience of Hitler's orders, raced about the country to make sure that vital communications, plants and stores were not blown up by zealously obedient Army officers and party hacks."</p>

<p>Most of those so called Hitler quotes from that book are fictional or altered for dramatic effect in the book "The rise and fall of the third reich" and the movie based on it "der untergang." It also seems to be misunderstood the intended meaning behind alot of verified statements by Hitler. This largely stems from two things. One being the obvious propaganda incentives for distorting and taking out of context various statements, and the other being the linguistic differences and lack of better translated terminology. Even though you can translate something into English, it doesnt always translate the desired implications, connotations and contextual variables originally intended in the statement. Certain political interests have grossly exploited this poorly understood fact and have painted a very skewed and distorted picture when it comes to examining the 3rd Reich. This is true of any translation, whether it is German, English or Hebrew. Nazrac</p>

<p>Josef Mengele loves your style Golbez. How can you rationally argue that making a judgment of Mengele and the Final Solution is a POV statement? By your own whacked reason, the entire Hitler article is practically a POV statement. It is all about his madness. Does it make you mad that Hitler was mad? Does it make you mad that Mengele was mad? Does PistolPierre make you mad? Pardon my POV statement, but you make no sense.</p>
<p>You misquote my edit BTW. I said the sadism of the Nazi medical experiments were as appalling as the Final Solution. I did not say William L. Shirer wrote that.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Edits in "Legacy"</span></h2>
<p>WP is a free encyclopedia, and if you chose not to register, you can edit as IP.</p>
<p>Nice theory. Does anybody really read the IP edits, or are they all deleted without any other thought? I chose not to register.</p>
<p>In Legacy, it is said that Bavaria (to be more precise, the minister of the finance there) holds the copyright on "Mein Kampf". This is contested; furthermore, there is "Hitler's second book", published by Weinberg from the US, did not have "copyright problems".</p>
<p>It is said that in Germany, it is illegal to display swastikas. Also wrong. There was a popular T-Shirt in the 90s with a swastika being thrown into a trashcan; there also are swastikas galore on the cover of Turtledove's book "In the presence of mine enemies". It is true that in the young federal republic, period photos were edited to delete the swastikas; this is no longer the case. It is forbidden to show symbols of the dictature (also the SS runes, and so on...) uncommented or to glorify the Nazis (like, eg, the english prince some years ago). To display a swastika for demonstration purposes, as a symbol of other cultures (indian mythology, kanji ethymology, .......), or in a way that it is clear you do NOT sympathize with the Nazis, is possible. (eg, Swastika in trashcan, or the TIME-like austrian newspaper "profil" had a series with a swastika in a crosshairs as its symbol).</p>
<p>Some time ago, I got the information about Hitlers family and what happened to them. I wrote it into the wikipedia to have it handy and to share it with other people. Obviously, it got reverted; as I wanted to check something today, the information was no longer in the article.</p>
<p>Perhaps you could write what kind of contribution is wished by the wikipedia, and what not. But please, correct the abovementioned factual errors regardless of the criteria. --85.181.29.81 04:56, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Dear 85,</p>
<ul>
<li>the Bavarian finance department does hold the copyright for MK, as well as all other possession of Hitler.</li>
<li>the display of a Nazi Swastika and other symbols deemed anti-constitutional is illegal. That many anti-Fascists use the swastika in such contexts is another matter, and in doing so they are putting themselves in danger of being prosecuted, as the aim is not always that clear. Just recently such a case was considered by a court (I don't know more right now.)</li>
<li>And yes, we actually read edits by IPs. I think they are read even more than those by regular editors. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 16:07, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
