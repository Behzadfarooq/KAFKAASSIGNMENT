<p>Karl, the info you inserted into Hitler was word for word accurate (I guess you are referring to this by naming Shirer - Machtan is not impeccable scholarship but the author of the fringe theory). However, the info was also mere details of which we could included thousands and your edit summary "Hitler's sexuality" betrayed your POV, as did your follow-up posting of a category. We will not have fringe hypothesis with bascically not a strain of credulity in the article, especially not by decreeing them as fact or by sneaking them in by not stating but alluding. I don't care what the Homosexual community thinks on this, I care for the Historical community and what it thinks on Machtan. How the deletion of poorly based, overblown claims that one of the biggest mass murderer in history were an homosexual can be considered "homophobic" is beyond even the wild extensions of that term one commonly encounters. If your care for procedure, than put it up for discussion on the Hitler talk page. Thanks very much. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 16:08, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Your opinion on Professor Machtan is irrelevant. And, as noted in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hidden_Hitler_a4f2.html" title="The Hidden Hitler">The Hidden Hitler</a> article, his research and conclusions have been widely accepted by other scolars, critics, book reviewers, and major media. Wikipedia details reliable and credible sources for such claims such as that in <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Lincoln_11e8.html" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> as one example. Plus, there are dozens of others where statements from far less credible sources appear in the biography and they are given the "gay" category. Wikipedia reports credible sources, and NPOV means we editors don't make claims as to their veracity. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarl_Schalike_f2d6.html" title="User:Karl Schalike">Karl Schalike</a> 16:17, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I move the section over from the article, for further discussion. Karl, apart from any concerns about content, your placing of this section on the top of the article suggests POV pushing in my book. [Talk:Adolf_Hitler#Excised_section Here it is.] -- <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 16:18, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Str1977 - Do not revert my edit. That is contrary to Wikipedia policy. As stated already, if you have diagreements with any of the facts I inserted, then air your opinion here. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarl_Schalike_f2d6.html" title="User:Karl Schalike">Karl Schalike</a> 16:23, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Karl,</p>
<ul>
<li>please read the article on Kubizek you have linked to and see the standards of any valid treatment of this hypothesis looks like. Than compare it with your inclusion here.</li>
<li>regardless of what I think about Machtan (and his hilarious if not so saddening thesis on why Hitler put homosexuals into camps certainly doesn't invoke any high estimations), his theory is (to put it mildly) not widely accepted. It is disputed. Hence including Hitler into the category of homosexual politicians is unacceptable. (That might be a problem in other articles too, but if you care about that go there and removed them there. Improve these articles - don't worsen this one to prove a point,)</li>
<li>Since when is Mrs Haamann a homosexual activist? Her article here doesn't exist and her article on the German WP certainly doesn't imply this.</li>

Again, your opinion of Machtan is not relevant. Wikipedia policy is extremely clear on this editing policy.

<li>This Karl guy is a nutbag. The only "proof" he can site is this Prof. Machtan's claims. This is another case of this "encyclopedia" giving creedence to the fictious writings of some anti- nazi windbag. You guys should really check out your own entries. Here's a hint. Click on Lothar Machtan above, read the "factual" wikipedia article about him CAREFULLY, then click on all 3 men listed as homosexuals that helped Hitler rise to power, and read their profiles. Notice anything strange? The first thing you should notice is that 2 of them, as well as Hitler, were dead before Machtan was born, so it's easy to claim they were gay, they can't say otherwise and who's going to stand up for them?? However, if you read the Ernst Hanfstaengl profile you will find it says he was married in 1920 and had 2 children. A married homosexual with 2 children? Sounds like somebody (Machtan) has his wire crossed.I like to call all this "Hitlerphobia". For years people claimed he was Jewish because of the holocaust. That he was gay because homosexuals were also targeted. I've even heard he was desended from gypses and that's why they were targeted as well.GET A CLUE!! You don't kill your own kind. Did the 2 Jewish kids at Columbine kill other Jews? No, they shot minorities and Christians. Did the 3 Jewish college students that did those Alabama church burnings burn any synagogs? No. Seen any gay guys arrested lately for "gay-bashing"? What I'm trying to say is, quit trying to make Hitler something he was not. It's like saying the Christian participents in the Crusades were secretly Muslims or that the KKK was made up of (secretly) black men. The guy's been dead for 60 years, let it rest. If you can't, try pondering this. It's been almost as long since the U.S. dropped 2 Atomic bombs on Japan. Do you think the Japanese call president Franklin Roosevelt a (secretly) Japanese homosexual?</li>

<dd>What next? David Irving coming along to edit the article and say that Hitler didn't know about the Holocaust? This article is fast becoming a joke.

<p>Str1977 - You have reverted my edits three times in less than 24 hours. One more time and I will have no choice but to report a violation of the three revert rule. Regretfully, further mass deletions of factual NPOV and relevant material from impeccable sources will force me to refer such conduct to the Wikipedia Arbitration Committee. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarl_Schalike_f2d6.html" title="User:Karl Schalike">Karl Schalike</a> 16:48, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Karl, no, I have reverted twice and consciously refrained from reverting a third time, though I could have done so. BTW, you always have a choice in your actions, especially in whether to report a (hypothetical) violation of Wiki rules. I have in the recent past encountered quite a few violations of 3RR and haven't reported. I know about ArbCom and have recently been involved in a very long-lasting case resembling this one a bit (not yet, but the substance is there). The offender is banned now, so please be reasonable. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 17:22, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On the contrary, Karl, YOU have reverted MY edits three times, and for factual material to be deleted, it first has to be posted. Your material doesn't count. Bring on the Committee, it will be great to get a decision on this. Can't wait.

<p>The correct place for your material, Karl, would be in a separate article; it is far too long for this one, and based on material that is unproven and written by POV-biased sources. Tell us - what do Kershaw or some of the other Hitler biographers have to say on this issue? Can you name one that corroborates any of your claims? No. My suggestion is to a seperate article and provide a link to it from here, but it is inappropriate for inclusion here. Perhaps the other editors might post their opinions also and we can arrive at a consensus. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Dorosh_6aa0.html" title="User:Michael Dorosh">Michael Dorosh</a> 17:10, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Your conduct here violates the principles and policy under which Wikipedia operates.

<p>Whether or not the assertion that Hitler was homosexual is an "attack" is completely dependent on one's point of view. Personally, I am much more concerned with the lack of reference to the fascist nature of Hitler's ideology, which appears to me (and apparently others) to be easily proved. I can't get too up-tight about whether Hitler should be in the "Gay politicians" category, when we still can't agree (along with the German wikipedia) that the article should link to the Fascism category. It concerns me more when an editor removes reference to the Holocaust, and to the millions of deaths caused by Hitler's aggression, from the introduction, than to speculation as to Hitler's sexuality.<br />
Having said that, I agree that the article should not include the proposed long essay on Hitler's sexuality - it all seems based on after-the-fact speculation, and rumours abounding at the time. Of course people in the thirties would "cast aspersions" on Hitler's sexuality - in those days, to call someone "effeminate" was one of the acceptable forms of discrediting them. How can it be <i>proved</i> one way or the other? How can some professor "declare" that Hitler was gay? (Dorothy Thompson's remark about Hitler "crooking his little finger when he drinks a cup of tea" is, frankly, hilarious, and not worth mentioning in any article).<br />
I would invite Karl Schalike to create a short paragraph in this article and link to the article "Hitler's sexuality", where the various theories can be put forward. Then the debate can take place there, and we can get on with the more relevant discussion as to the nature of Hitler's regime and ideology. <a href="../../../c/p/m/User%7ECPMcE_3017.html" title="User:CPMcE"><i>Camillus</i></a> <a href="../../../c/p/m/User_talk%7ECPMcE_6ecc.html" title="User talk:CPMcE">(talk)</a> 18:01, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The speculative material about sexuality is wholly unsupported and has no place in this article. Speculative, unsupported published sources are not reliable nor verifiable and therefore are not acceptable under WP guidelines. There is zero, I repeat, <i>zero</i> evidence AH and Gustl Kubicek had sexual relations and most of the other stuff bandied about on the subject of Mr Hitler's sex life through the years has been codswallop. Meanwhile, WP has had similar incidents involving Abraham Lincoln and Elvis Presley along with at least a dozen other famous (and very dead) people. At the very most and only to diffuse this abuse of WP I'd support a separate article called Adolf Hitler's sexuality in which this stuff could be mentioned and thoroughly debunked. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 18:31, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Fred Bauder has already said that RfA likely needs to be fixed. The admin who tossed me into that wrote an email apologizing profusely for it and tried to get me pulled out but he was ignored, they <s>boneheadedly</s> didn't do their homework and thought I was defending someone's honour or something. Give me a frickin' break. I respect arbcomm but they botched is all. It'll work itself out. I will revert this sort of codswallop on sight and would welcome any new RfA that would examine the clear sourcing vios this sort of unscholarly abuse represents. There are plenty of historical figures for whom we have clear evidence that a mention along these lines is helpful and appropriate and by the bye, have a look at <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dana_Plato_0712.html" title="Dana Plato">Dana Plato</a> for an example where I've politely insisted supported evidence of LGBT behaviour be reflected. I've also contributed heavily to <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberace.html" title="Liberace">Liberace</a>. Some biographiocal subjects warrant this discussion. Adolf Hitler, Mr charismatic world shaking genocidal sociopath, is not one of them. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 18:44, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Beware conflation</b> Readers are cautioned that conflation of documented facts is rampant in popular historical topics like AH. For example, <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernst_R%C3%B6hm_da41.html" title="Ernst Röhm">Ernst Röhm</a> is documented has having been homosexual and there is no meaningful dissent among historians about it. Röhm had a public image problem as a result, even resorting to (ineffective) newspaper campaigns in which he was photographed with his mother. Moreover, the <a href="../../../s/a/_/SA_3dd6.html" title="SA">SA</a> had many practicing homosexuals in its leadership ranks. When AH purged the SA and ordered Röhm shot in his prison cell it was because the brownshirts were threatening his absolute political control of the Nazi party. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 20:02, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Implication in detail</b></p>
<p>Clearly you can build a valid argument from true premises, and arrive at a true conclusion. You can also build a valid argument from false premises, and arrive at a false conclusion.</p>
<p>The tricky part is that you can start with false premises, proceed via valid inference, and reach a <em>true</em> conclusion. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Premise: All fish live in the ocean</li>
<li>Premise: Sea otters are fish</li>
<li>Conclusion: Therefore sea otters live in the ocean</li>
</ul>
<p>There's one thing you can't do, though: start from true premises, proceed via valid deductive inference, and reach a false conclusion.</p>
<p>We can summarize these results as a '<b>truth table'</b> for implication. The symbol "=&gt;" denotes implication; "A" is the premise, "B" the conclusion. "T" and "F" represent true and false respectively.</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3" align="center">
<caption>Truth Table for Implication</caption>
<tr>
<th>Premise</th>
<th>Conclusion</th>
<th>Inference</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>A</th>
<th>B</th>
<th>A =&gt; B</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">false</td>
<td align="center">false</td>
<td align="center">true</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">false</td>
<td align="center">true</td>
<td align="center">true</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">true</td>
<td align="center">false</td>
<td align="center">false</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">true</td>
<td align="center">true</td>
<td align="center">true</td>
</tr>
</table>
<ul>
<li>If the premises are false and the inference valid, the conclusion can be true or false. (Lines 1 and 2.)</li>
<li>If the premises are true and the conclusion false, the inference must be invalid. (Line 3.)</li>
<li>If the premises are true and the inference valid, the conclusion must be true. (Line 4.)</li>
</ul>
<p>So <em>the fact that an argument is valid doesn't necessarily mean that its conclusion holds</em> -- it may have started from false premises.</p>
<p>If an argument is valid, and in addition it started from true premises, then it is called a <b>sound</b> argument. A sound argument must arrive at a true conclusion.</p>
<hr />
<p>I hope Karl can recognize that his argument belongs to the row 3 of the table - a false (or at least unproven, unprovable and not accepted) conclusion starting from true premises, resulting in an unsound argument. While the miscellany of fact and conjecture he has compiled may be based on actual events, they don't lead to any valid inference about Hitler's sexuality. Using Karl's arguments one can also pin down every effeminate, squeamish, soft-skinned etc man that one knows as gay - if that isn't the worst sort of homophobic or sexist stereotyping, I don't know what is. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 00:07, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>For years it has been known that and a number of Hitler's high-ranking henchman were <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexual.html" title="Homosexual">homosexual</a> and as far back as 1931 the <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munich_Post_2b02.html" title="Munich Post">Munich Post</a> reported that "every knowledgeable person knows that inside the Hitler party, the most flagrant whorishness contemplated by <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paragraph_175.html" title="Paragraph 175">paragraph 175</a> is widespread." The newspaper attacked "the disgusting hypocrisy that the Nazi Party demonstrates--outward moral indignation (against homosexuality) while inside its own ranks the most shameless practices prevail." As well, there were early suggestions that Adolf Hitler himself might have been gay. After interviewing Hitler in 1931, American <a href="../../../j/o/u/Journalist.html" title="Journalist">journalist</a> <a href="../../../d/o/r/Dorothy_Thompson_19ec.html" title="Dorothy Thompson">Dorothy Thompson</a>, noted by <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_magazine.html" title="Time magazine">Time magazine</a> in 1939 as one of the two most influential women in the United States, wrote about Hitler's "soft, almost feminine charm." She alluded to his possible homosexuality as much as media standards and political realities of the day allowed by saying "I bet he crooks his little finger when he drinks a cup of tea."</p>
<p>In 1945 Samuel Igra published <i>Germany's National Vice</i>, which said homosexuality ran through the heart of Nazism. Igra named Hitler aides and close friends who he said were known homosexuals. In what is considered the definitive history of <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_Germany_add9.html" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a>, the 1960 book <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rise_and_Fall_of_the_Third_Reich_619a.html" title="The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich">The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich</a></i> by <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_L._Shirer_d2d0.html" title="William L. Shirer">William L. Shirer</a> states that "many of the early Nazis were homosexual - who flocked to the party as if to a natural haven." Shirer wrote that Hitler, "who was so monumentally intolerant by his very nature, was strangely tolerant of one human condition-a man's morals."</p>
<p>During the latter part of 1905, Hitler met musician <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_Kubizek_1b13.html" title="August Kubizek">August Kubizek</a> and the two quickly became close friends, sharing a bed in a room they rented on the Stumpergasse in Vienna. In his post-war book, <i>Young Hitler, the Story of Our Friendship</i>, Kubizek wrote that during their time together Hitler "always rejected the coquettish advances of girls or women. Women and girls took an interest in him in <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linz.html" title="Linz">Linz</a> as well as <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vienna.html" title="Vienna">Vienna</a>, but he always evaded their endeavors." In Kubizek's book he also wrote that Hitler had a great love for a girl named "Stefanie" and wrote her countless love poems but never sent them to her. Instead, the book says, Hitler read his poem "Hymn to the Beloved" to Kubizek. Several scholars have claimed that evidence shows that parts of Kubizek's book were fabricated, and the extensive research by Professor <a href="../../../l/o/t/Lothar_Machtan_b273.html" title="Lothar Machtan">Lothar Machtan</a> stated that while the Stefanie girl definitely existed, some of the 1953 writing was a deliberate "heterosexualizing" of Hitler in retrospect.</p>
<p>In Germany, <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychology.html" title="Psychology">psychology</a> professor Manfred Koch-Hillebrecht published <i>Homo Hitler. Psychogramm des deutschen Diktators.</i> in 1999 and in 2001, Lothar Machtan, historian and professor of Modern and Current History at <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Bremen_01f3.html" title="University of Bremen">University of Bremen</a>, published <i>Hitlers Geheimnis. Das Doppelleben eines Diktators</i> with an English translation by John Brownjohn titled "<i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hidden_Hitler_a4f2.html" title="The Hidden Hitler">The Hidden Hitler</a></i>." In his work, Professor Machtan presents a documented study of Adolf Hitler's homosexuality and the impact his being gay had upon his life and career. Machtan writes that the records show Hitler himself never condemned homosexuality, but he allowed the murder and persecution of gays in order to keep the secret of his own homosexuality from surfacing. The respected Austrian gay activist, historian, and writer <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigitte_Hamann_e3d1.html" title="Brigitte Hamann">Brigitte Hamann</a> too has investigated Hitler's homosexuality and appears in the 2004 <a href="../../../h/b/o/HBO_509e.html" title="HBO">HBO</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/Documentary_film.html" title="Documentary film">documentary film</a> <i><a href="../../../d/e/b/Hidden_Fuhrer%7E_Debating_the_Enigma_of_Hitler%27s_Sexuality_fcc2.html" title="Hidden Fuhrer: Debating the Enigma of Hitler's Sexuality">Hidden Fuhrer: Debating the Enigma of Hitler's Sexuality</a></i> by gay American documentarians Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato.</p>

<p>There is absolutely no consensus to keep this section as is in the article, and certainly not where it was placed (wedged between Early Childhood and something else). If necessary one can mention that there is some speculation on Hitler's sexuality, and place references or footnotes, but follow it up by explaining that no major biographer or scholar of the Nazi period has ever supported or mentioned evidence of the notion that Hitler was homosexual. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 04:17, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry, but you have ignored <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicy_66bd.html" title="Wikipedia:Policy">Wikipedia:policy</a>. Inserting a section for someone's sexuality exists in Wikipedia already and is part of numerous articles with a Wikipedia "Gay" Category given to many Wikipedia biographies based on little more than rumors. Like it or not, the <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_a514.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee">Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee</a> supported this fact with <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOnefortyone_0698.html" title="User:Onefortyone">Onefortyone</a>. Editor's on the Hitler article do not have the right to "vote" to ignore the issue. Editors here do not work in a vacuum, we are required to work within the established rules and policies, or, if we disagree, we apply to the Arbitration Committee to change them. No editor here has the right to ignore the research of a <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Bremen_01f3.html" title="University of Bremen">University of Bremen</a> professor and respected historian for more than 27 years whose conclusions that Adolf Hitler was <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexual.html" title="Homosexual">homosexual</a> is supported by historian <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigitte_Hamann_e3d1.html" title="Brigitte Hamann">Brigitte Hamann</a> and others.

<p>How many of the historians supporting Machtan have published a major work on Hitler? A small community of fringe writers supporting each other (much like we've seen on these very talk pages, really) does not make historical allegations any more true.

She is a reputed historian and biographer and was cited in my courses about Hitler but never did this allegation come up seriously.

<p>The none-too-subtle nature of Karl Schalike's threating to turn this into a discrimination issue is absolutely nothing short of contemptible. Oh, it might be worth pointing out that I, myself, am gay. That said, this matter has nothing in the slightest to do with homophobia other than its use here as a shameless coercion tactic.</p>
<p>Any rational human being will glean from Karl's writing here the extent to which he has made this a personal point of contention, thus espousing a POV motivated more by pre-conceived socio-political notions than any desire for historical accuracy. Indeed, the comment in which he states refusal to accept the "credible sources" as conclusive "says volumes about the Wikipedia editor" is laughable for its sheer irony, as is the one declaring all dissenting 'opinions' to be irrelevent (ditto for the factual evidence behind those opinions, apparently, as he never even once directly responded to any of them).</p>
<p>Karl, what speaks volumes about the editors here is the monumental sense of patience they've displayed in entertaining this tomfoolery - I seriously doubt I could have been so polite. Now, given your utter distain for matters of opinion, let's use some common sense and resolve this with a simple question (and one wholly un-influenced by opinion, to boot!)</p>
<p>Effectively, it comes down to this: Are you able to state that your supported view on this matter is one accepted by the vast majority of credible, reputable historians and academic community?</p>
<p>Lest you have any confusion, and wend in causing yourself further embarassment, I'll help answer that for you: No, you can't, and for this reason it has no rightful place being presented as accepted truth in the context of a non-fiction reference source. Period. Is there really any left to talk about? --JBowman79 23:44, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The section speculating about Hitler possibly being homosexual was removed because the user who removed it said that it did not have enough evidence. But the article J. Edgar Hoover speculates about Hoover being homosexual and that has not been removed. There is far more evidence for the allegations of Hitler's homosexuality than for Hoover's and for some of the other historical figures described as homosexual on wikipedia. <a href="../../../f/d/r/User%7EFDR_67d4.html" title="User:FDR">FDR</a> <a href="../../../f/d/r/User_talk%7EFDR_b075.html" title="User talk:FDR">MyTalk</a> 23:15 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
