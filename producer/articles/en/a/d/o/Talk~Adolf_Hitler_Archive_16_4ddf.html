<p>I think the link to the Hitler museum should be eliminated it claims to be neutral but is really a Nazi front site as indicated by its own link page.

<p>FK. I have Sectioned this story somewhat. I said each edit that it was a necessary section. Some people have short sight and sectioning can assist them. Others would get lost in the screen , or the story, yes? <a href="../../../e/f/f/User%7EEffK_b5e6.html" title="User:EffK">EffK</a> 18:57, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Atkins and Tallet as to the truth of the <i>quid pro quo</i> <b>attested</b> and provided by User John Kenney, as User:Str1977]] well knows. Kick back is a translation in to American English, and is used there to describe the <b>same</b>. I'll get the <i>diff</i>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Centre_Party_%28Germany%29/Archive1&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Centre_Party_%28Germany%29/Archive1&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Centre_Party_%28Germany%29/Archive1&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4</a>[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Centre_Party_%28Germany%29/Archive1&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Centre_Party_%28Germany%29/Archive1&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>]</dd>
<dd>Looking at it, I will admit that the basic substance of Flamekeeper's accusations seems to be supported by Atkin and Tallett's narrative - Pius XI and Pacelli <i>were</i> willing to acquiesce in the Centre Party's demise as a <i>quid pro quo</i> in return for the Concordat, and Kaas was, essentially, acting as their agent.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>FK. Now, I sourced that <b>all parties</b> allowed the use of Art 48 in October 1931, so why suggest other-wise, {User:Str1977}}&#160;? Please, be true to source ,esp. especially when I have sourced exactitudes.</p>
<p>FK. Now, why do you deny the relevance of , and remove the highlight to, the completely relevant and justified Westphalian-Industrial Magnates and the Nazis, Str1977&#160;? It is apparent that the course of Hitler's life is over-turned by this financial support in the most truly revolutionary fashion. I say this is an effort at POV enforcement .</p>
<p>FK. Now, I am aware that you possess strong will to insert your radical opinion via such removals , and that you do this to the limit of rationality, and beyond- as in the Source which you are prepared to traduce and yet leave billed by author. This is clearly un-acceptble policy by you, and I do not have to analyse your motivation for doing so. Your assertion as to your opinion re The Fire, is entirely un-sourced by any means, and we, I, am only interested in that which an editor can prove in good faith, as I do so. I do so to the extent of illustration of reason based in all source, including that provided by ,you say, your religion. I do not have to tarry here, as my analysis is hitherto crystal clear&#160;: I accuse you of utterly <b>ir</b>-rational allowance to yourself, of arrogation to yourself of <b>power in Wikipedia greater than the accepted norms of Source</b>.</p>
<p>FK. Now, in the case of the <b>Magnates</b>, you starkly continue to reduce the truths available through history as sourced, even as represented in Wikipedia . I am detained obnoxiously by this mis-use of good-will, my good will. Here and now you continue to provoke the serious rift of rational consensus the which I as User, should not have had to expect , or suffer still.</p>
<p>FK. I can only hope that some reasonable editors might realise the extreme action you take in this regard here and now. The thought that this is to continue between the two of us alone is provocation to that which I am then attacked for, explanations and ranting etc etc. Now I hope that rational witnesses and editors will avail of the buttons to undo what is opinionated editing, ie POV editing. The serious nature of Str1977 editing has come to my shocked attention since this editor's arrival on Wikipedia, as I openly attest. Any more POV changes cannot expect to further ruin my capacities to undertake good faith in WP, and I warn you here that I shall therefore with equanimity await your further POV insistence, add them all together, and post them where Arbitration will hopefully deal with you. So, go ahead, User but spare us waffle here- do your damage and here limit yourself to sourced justifications for your NPOV . <a href="../../../e/f/f/User%7EEffK_b5e6.html" title="User:EffK">EffK</a> 21:51, 15 December 2005 (UTC)ps you say that Papen conspired against Schleicher <i>with</i> Schleicher.&#160;!!

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Missing from this Article</span></h2>
<p>I am glad to see that some of my input remains on this page, but several omissions are noticeable.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reichskonkordat.html" title="Reichskonkordat">Reichskonkordat</a>, and the <i>quid pro quo</i>/kick-back thereof negotiated. User:Str1977 it seems balks at the inclusion of this history. This is very wrong, in fact its omission is a scandal in itself...</p>
<p>Monsignor or Prelate <a href="../../../l/u/d/Ludwig_Kaas_3696.html" title="Ludwig Kaas">Ludwig Kaas</a> is mentioned, as he should be, several times- but there is no link upon his name...</p>
<p>'Charismatic' stinks - what is this some kind of SPOV(sympathetic)/POV&#160;? It is inaccurate as the word charismatic qualifies a lasting positive. Charismatic would certainly be appropriate to a contemporary report, but not as a one word hindsight description of a genocidal maniac. I agree we're all too stupid to find the right word- a one to keep up with the simplistic nature that some accord to these pages , but again say that mesmerising is less POV, but no I don't have a <i>theasaurus</i> ...</p>
<p>'Internal links' to Anti-semitism , Nazi Concepts, Appeasement, Concordats, People various seem to be absent along with the other matters I mention . I am no longer prepared to be assailed by reverts- as last on 15 December, designed to discredit me, and therefore leave this for virtuous editors' inspection.... <a href="../../../e/f/f/User%7EEffK_b5e6.html" title="User:EffK">EffK</a> 10:23, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>-Maybe a quick statement as to why your input omissions should be "noticable" would help everyone? And just because the word 'charismatic' is misunderstood by some people, doesn't change its definition.

<dd>I already did. It's still dumb and its still there. Re ommissions Noticeable because they are put in every history worth its salt. The deal with the Reichskonkordat gave international acceptance to a pariah , persuaded a third more Germans to more willingly accept the Nazi State, and this was effected through Ludwig Kaas. 'German businessmen' is imprecision, repeated twice . The sectioning I placed was clearer-at present it's distraction and counter-productive. But, here's a statement as to why I cannot even clean-up my own input- I refer you to my response of a few days ago at <b>15 December</b> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/EffK/Evidence#3_December_20052005" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/EffK/Evidence#3_December_20052005" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>],<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/EffK/Evidence#3_December_2005" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/EffK/Evidence#3_December_2005" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/EffK/Evidence#3_December_2005</a></dd>
<dd>I'm fed up with the revisionism that goes down here. It has always been impossible for me to edit on any articles, as revisionism buts in before appropriate clean-up can start. It is like building an <i>enciclo</i> during a punch-up. I note the tone of user Calderra/gspawn with regret. Are you suggesting that I am un-helpful by chance&#160;? I suggest that good faith would return this article to the manner in which I left it recently , OK? Revisionism is very subtle, by the way , and uses the handy coverlets of <i>enciclo</i>, length, off-topic, all when at last we have the chance to write a full enciclo . Tt costs a dime for a million words, so what's with these attitudes&#160;?</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">You cannot win the propaganda race</span></h2>
<p>For me it seems to be quite clear that you cannot keep the current propaganda pictuture of Hitler within this English Wiki article. You will have to decide by yourself. Or you will have to learn. So easy is that. Hans Rosenthal (ROHA) (hans.rosenthal AT t-online.de -- replace AT by @ ) (22.12.2005) PS: Remove the pic, then I will remove your pic. Thats what it is all about.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hans again changed the picture and the article is again protected. Like many others, I find Hans' abusive and disruptive behavior very disturbing and I completely understand if some people here don't want to negotiate with him anymore after he left the discussion. I also think that threatening to vandalize this article until the picture is changed he is weakening his point and he should be shown that we don't allow vandalism. He should just be banned and ignored. However, I further understand (please correct me) that he can change his IPs across a very broad range which makes it difficult or even impossible to ban him.</dd>
<dd>Let me try to understand him. I know, that he spends a lot of time on this and the German article. He is very interested in Hitler and he is attending the discussions to the Hitler article in the German wikipedia, where he also doesn't have a user account and is largely ignored. I guess (don't know) that he is Jewish (from his name) and considerably older than most other wikipedians (from his comments above, where he said <i>you young [something something]</i>). Taking into account that Hans is possibly Jewish (certainly German) and Germany's history, his obsession with the picture makes sense, so I suggest we should be considerate with him and not judge him too hard.</dd>
<dd>Talking about the picture, I personally was also a little bit shocked when I saw that a propaganda photo appeared on top of the article, but didn't want to start a discussion when the article just had improved that much. But, when I read Charles' comments about his childhood experience with propaganda, I couldn't refrain from giving my two cents. I see from comments above that some other people also didn't like the photo. For technical reasons (resolution, cropping) the picture may be preferable, but it certainly is <b>not <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_7fb1.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">NPOV</a></b> (simply because it is propaganda) and therefore not appropriate for use in an encyclopedia that can be accessed by everyone, e.g. children and other people, who are not familiar with European history, and who are susceptible to propaganda. I don't think it matters what kind of photography Stalin's article shows, but I think, even if this would mean giving in to terrorism, even if Hans should be banned, a different picture has to be found. I think we had one before, that was (maybe technically inferior) more appropriate, because more neutral. As Charles said, the current picture could be placed somewhere farther in the article, so the point about how Hitler wanted to present himself could still be made.</dd>

<dd>No excuse - good stuff. I'm familiar with the Elizabeth article, so I took it as an example, and my portrait point relates to propaganda only. But just for the hell of it - the English queen condoned criminal privateering for the benefit of the state, encouraged colonisation by driving out natives, oversaw war in Ireland "<i>by fire, sword and famine</i>" (justified by dodgy racial comparisons), and used propaganda to great affect for the establishment of a greater England and, ultimately, Britain: how small is the difference? When it comes to historical comparisons, I've left messages above about our fascination with Hitler and relative ignorance of Stalin - we seem so eager to heap our opprobrium on him that we forget he was just a man, and that others have been equally capable of evil.--<a href="../../../s/h/t/User%7EShtove_8f32.html" title="User:Shtove">shtove</a> 20:22, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I still think, I didn't excuse him but tried to understand him, there is a difference. I like what you said about the queen and how people are capable of evil. Probably there are still many people out there who adore her as a strong monarch. Ok, so tell me about her pictures, please. Are there pictures of Elizabeth that show her in a more NPOV way, show her recognizably, and are appropriate for an encyclopedia? <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMale1979_76fc.html" title="User:Male1979">Ben</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMale1979_96ca.html" title="User talk:Male1979">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Male1979_fd02.html" title="Special:Contributions/Male1979">C</a></sub> 21:25, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Even if an act can't be justified, it can be excused (the difference between murder and manslaughter in a crime of passion); but even if it can't be excused, can it be understood? Perhaps in a psychiatric sense. I agree with your comments on Hans, but a person of good faith shouldn't entertain crankiness in others - it only encourages the buggers to keep doing what they're doing. On Elizabeth's portraits, I think there's five contained in the article, two of which are non-propaganda (or non-iconographic); there's a good external link at the end of the article, which shows just how well she managed her image. I think both types of portrait (if they really are to be distinguished) are appropriate to Wikipedia - include as many as possible. Should the lead photograph be a strong one? I'd say so, just to grab attention for the article - after all, the greater part of the content is in the words. There are people who adore Elizabeth, and rightly so - she was a remarkable woman; unfortunately, many of her admirers are unthinking patriots. Have you voted in the <i>Charisma</i> delete-undelete section above? The only right government is "<i>of the people, by the people, for the people</i>", but I think the Hitler obsession sets up a historical costume drama that helps people to ignore Abe Lincoln's advice and claim vindication for their own prejudices. I'm not mad.--<a href="../../../s/h/t/User%7EShtove_8f32.html" title="User:Shtove">shtove</a> 22:27, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Our understandings of excuse seem to differ. I say he should be punished because he violated rules. His behavior is not acceptable. When I say, I can try to understand it, I mean that his motives were possibly not "evil", in a way that's similar to manslaughter and murder. This judgement of mine is perfectly in line with the <i>assume good faith</i> guideline.</dd>
<dd>I wholeheartedly agree with what you said, about "<i>of the people, by the people, for the people</i>" and Hitler cult as a vindication to defy democratic principals. However, I don't see what your conclusion is. Mine is the following: Nazis and anti-democrats characterize him as the energetic, charismatic, and strong leader, who started a war, determined to help the German people that was unable to help itself. I think a picture showing him in a uniform promotes that characterization and is therefore bad in the lead.</dd>
<dd>I didn't read the Elizabeth stuff yet (I have to admit I suspect it to be off-topic), but I will. There is a saying: "a picture says more than 1000 words." Pictures convey emotions to the viewer. For pictures there should be the same policy as for text. They should be NPOV. This means, that if there is a pro-something picture, it has to be complemented with enough NPOV pictures and explanations and possibly POV pictures for the other side. Propaganda pictures unbalance an article.</dd>

<p>I don't see what the big deal about Adolf Hitler's picture is. When I first saw the picture, I had no idea it was a propaganda picture. It's not like it says "help Germany win the war" or anything. Just because the picture was taken for propaganda purposes, it doesn't mean it is propaganda. Hitler was a military leader--what's wrong with depicting him in a uniform? --Bowlhover 22:36, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Most usable (i.e. good quality, close up) photos will be propaganda or publicity shots at least. Does anyone even have a photo not authorized by Hitler that could be used? --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavril2020_6819.html" title="User:Davril2020">Davril2020</a> 04:52, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>If Hitler had left one legacy, it’s his propaganda machine. Even his advisory Josef Stalin was interested in the way the Fuhrer portrait himself to the world. For just that reason Germans rarely publish anything Nazi. Instead of fighting about the propaganda pictures, rather add an interpretation of the photo and state its propaganda value. If no propaganda material is to be shown then all photos of Hitler taken after the end of the First World War should be removed.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">six to ten million Jews? Wannsee, and "final solution"</span></h2>
<p>Was this citation footnoted? If anything, I'd always heard the figure was between five and six million (I recall reading that <i>The Destruction of European Jewry</i>, described as the most definitive work on the Holocaust [written by Jewish historian Raul Hilberg], put the number around 5.1 million).</p>
<p>Also I've read that the Wannsee Conference was the not *the* time and place where the Holocaust was "planned", in fact there was no single meeting that laid out the whole process, but people like to imagine there was a singlular event that can be identified as the "main event" so to speak. (Consider the fact that Himmler himself did not attend.) (This fits in with what is sometimes referred to as the "functionalist" vs. the "intentionalist" school of Holocaust scholarship, with which I happen to agree [the former that is].)</p>
<p>Also "Endlösung" in German does not have any specific connotation to the Holocaust, in my experience, rather it is phrase (or word) which can be applied to any situation, thus the proper expression is "Endlösung der jüdischen Frage" or "Final Solution of the Jewish Question"--can any native speakers confirm this? --Critic9328 16:24, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Maybe then, now it's pretty closely connected to the Holocaust. --<a href="../../../y/o/o/User%7EYooden_5685.html" title="User:Yooden">Yooden</a></dd>

<p>You're right here. From the transcripts of the Wannsee Konferenz, we know that the Holocaust had already been planned by this point. Mobile gassing trucks were in use (they had originally been used to gas children with disabilities) and the gas chambers at Auschwitz were under construction. At Wannsee, the various branches of the Nazi bureacracy were instructed to put the "evacuation" (the euphemism used to describe killing) of the Jewish population into effect.</p>
<p>As to the number killed in the Holocaust, I've heard 5 million and I've heard 7 million, with most historians accepting the figure is around 6 million.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">ID of Hitler's body</span></h2>
<p>On a History Channel documentary they said that identification was made using Hitler's ears (I don't remember if it said that this was in conjunction with dental records or by itself), apparently ears are like fingerprints and they had some way of comparing the corpse they found with medical records.</p>
<p>Also they mentioned something about a double that Hitler had employed during the war to frustrated would-be assassins, and that this man was also killed at this time, this being part of the reason for the belief that Hitler himself survived. Finally they said he aimed the pistol he used upwards through his mouth, as a gunshot through the sinal cavity will cause massive distortion of the facial features, making identification difficult (Hitler was apparently loathe to subject his body to the same [mis]treatment that Mussolini had received in Italy [his body had been hung upside-down in a public square and people spit on it]).</p>
<p>Also the show claimed that his skull was not destroyed along with the rest of his remains in the 1960's but was sent back to Russia where it still exists.--Critic9328 16:20, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

Someone had tacked on ++++and the Nazis, unhelpfully, I always thought. Do we care that without their lolly/dosh/re-finacing and grants, that Hitler would have failed in his enterprise? That Papen, the ex-chancellor king-maker conspirator, welded through the bankers these <i>magnates</i> into the grand enterprise? The enterprise as a controlled <i>counter-revolution</i> or defeat of the entire left, even the democratic left, and married the desire of even the papacy to this. The sporting hero scheming two faced catholic nobleman, so well known to the German President, his family, the Aristocrats, the landowoning class of Prussia, the Army officer class, the magnates or largest Industrialists of particularly Rhine-westphalia, the Catholic Church highest, the corrupt nationalist media and business circle, the whole bang-shoot. Do we delete him, Papen, too, being as he is , sourceable as being and doing all this?
