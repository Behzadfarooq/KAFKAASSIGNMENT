<h2><span class="mw-headline">Criteria Proposals</span></h2>
<p>There has been a proposed section of <a href="../../../a/d/o/Wikipedia%7EAdopt-a-User_a79f.html" title="Wikipedia:Adopt-a-User">Wikipedia:Adopt-a-User</a> that includes specific criteria for adoption. This matter is being discussed and no criteria will be added until a consensus is reached. <b>When the final draft is made all previosly noted thoughts, opinions, and complaints should be reviewed.</b></p>
<p>These are the <i>proposed</i> versions of the criteria:</p>

<p>Have not been blocked in the last year</p>

<p>To quit this program you must have had a total of three adoptees, at seperate times, who's relationships with you have been ended for at least three months.

<p>Cannot currently be an adoptee and must have been free of adoption for the last two weeks and not have been accused of vandalism, must not have been blocked, and must be part of Concordia for one week.</p>

<dd>I agree, some of the rules are bad. I just added some to make it so we have guidelines, and that they could always be deleted.

<dl>
<dd>the reason I think these rules are better is that it ensures that the soon-to-be-adopter will be a good person for it but still retains more rights than in the first draft. I think we should have a "Constitutional Convention" and decide on the rules. Once the rules are finally agreed upon by all/most, than we write them out in an official manner and have <i>everyone</i> check themm over and make new suggestions. When everything is good, we will post them as the official criteria. I think that we should also debate over any point an unlimited number of times during and throughout the convention- that way if someone has a new thought, it will be expressed. I also think the we should have a criteria instead of lettimg anyone in. And, of course, we need to select who will take part in the convention, adopters, adoptees, both, anyone... I think anyone who is currently a member or anyone becomes a member during the debate. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandfan_08ca.html" title="User:Randfan">Randfan</a> 20:51, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>and we need to officially name this organization. I'm fine with Adopt-A-User but I think the adoptr should be called a Mentor/tutor (though that would ruin the theme). I like Mentor more.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>And we need to name the Adoptee (I'm fine with this name) <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandfan_08ca.html" title="User:Randfan">Randfan</a> 20:58, 3 November 2006 (UTC) <small>Post Scriptum: by now you should know I like using "and" at the beginning of a sentence and "official" a lot.</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Can we still adopt while this discussion is going on? Part of me says yes, part of me says no. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandfan_08ca.html" title="User:Randfan">Randfan</a> 20:58, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I'd like to listen to others before I vote and I'd like to vot for the final or something that will help/be developed into the final. i'm not to strongly opposed to this but not fully for it either (and I wrote it!) <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandfan_08ca.html" title="User:Randfan">Randfan</a> 21:14, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why don't we have discussion for each of the proposed criteria (must be Esperanza, must not be vandal, etc) instead of voting on proposals as a whole? --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Olsen_0313.html" title="User:Daniel Olsen">Daniel Olsen</a> 01:37, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>okay. I like yours. I think it may just need a few extra touches, if we combine 3 and 4 I think it would be great. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandfan_08ca.html" title="User:Randfan">Randfan</a> 21:36, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The Esperanza programme requirements are out of scope. Requirement for number of edits and/or time on Wikipedia makes more sense.

<dd>I think Daniel's idea is the best I've seen so far, as I agree with some of the above qualifications, but not all of them. The only thing you'd have to watch for was conflicting qualifications (e.g., must be/must not be a member of some guild/clan/project, etc). <b>...&#160;</b><span style="background-color: #11cbc4;width:52px;height:16px;font-size:12px;p{text-align:center}"><a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvriette_f119.html" title="User:Avriette">aa</a>:<a href="../../../a/v/r/User_talk%7EAvriette_2538.html" title="User talk:Avriette">talk</a></span> 02:16, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Do we really need any requirements? If a user thinks they know what they're doing and they want to help, then why shouldn't you be allowed to adopt someone less experienced than you? Why should you have to join Esperanza, KC, Concordia, and wait at least two weeks? Why shouldn't you be allowed to help out as many people as you want? I think 3 or four of the rules would exclude me as an adopter altogether. I agree with the fact that you shouldn't have vandalized or been blocked, and that you should be willing to help out (duh), but the rest is just useless beaurocracy. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Olsen_0313.html" title="User:Daniel Olsen">Daniel Olsen</a> 01:37, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>maybe we can call it a <b>guideline</b> instead of a criteria (that way they don't <i>have</i> to meet them but may think again if they see it and think they need more experience). <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandfan_08ca.html" title="User:Randfan">Randfan</a> 03:05, 5 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with Randfan here. But I would take out <i>any</i> mention of EA, KC, and CC.

<dd>Same here. Right now, Esperanza is a bit shaky also, and it's probably best to leave it out, at least for now. "Recommended" to join Esperanza and/or KC, but not required is probably better criteria for adopters. –- <strong><a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKungming2_bd1a.html" title="User:Kungming2"><font color="blue">kungming·</font></a><font color="green">2</font></strong> <a href="../../../k/u/n/User_talk%7EKungming2_b479.html" title="User talk:Kungming2"><font color="#999999"><sup>(Talk)</sup></font></a> 00:31, 27 November 2006 (UTC)
