<p>Advertising language is used in the article:</p>
<ul>
<li>...rapidly adapted to deliver...</li>
<li>...has since evolved to support...</li>
<li>...order-of-magnitude faster...</li>
<li>...making it a very attractive platform...</li>
</ul>
<p>Section "Supported Platforms" misses the point that Flash is not supported on many platforms such as Linux PPC, *BSD and others. The Linux x86 version is not very mature and it is outdated (v7,0,61,0) (this may be true for other platforms too).</p>
<dl>
<dd>I disagree with "missing the point". Flash supports more platforms than any other runtime environment (to my knowledge). Additionally, we are talking about computer used to browse the web. To me, the only notable exception to the supported platform list is Linux x86 version of version 8, but this is a very small amount considering that generally speaking, these computers are servers and are not running browsers, and that Linux boxes running browsers would be a very small minority of web browsers indeed (unfortunately).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps "...very attractive platform..." is a poor choice of words, but Flash really is the most sensible platform for delivering cross-platform software.
<dl>
<dd>"the most sensible platform for delivering cross-platform software." is purely POV, and Flash is not available for dozens of platforms (which is a fact, not a POV). --<a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELost.goblin_28b2.html" title="User:Lost.goblin">Lost Goblin</a> 00:22, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>I think the above discussion is missing the point. IMO, the reason this article sounds like advertising is because it considers only Macromedia's Flash player. There are several other flash players (see <a href="../../../s/w/f/SWF_f627.html#Players" title="SWF">SWF#Players</a>). We should redirect the page to Flash_Player, and treat all the players in the same article (even if the non-Macromedia sections are all stubs).</p>
<p><br />
I've done edits to the article that I think will make it sounds less like an advertisement. Take a read through, do changes to parts that I may have missed and when we agree the article is neutral we can remove the {{advert}} tag. Also, about the article only including the Macromedia player, maybe we could make a template with links all the flash players?

<p>How is this advertising? Personally, I don't see this as an adversising medium and it seems like they're just listing some of the features of Flash. A couple adjectives don't make it a advertisement, the author was just trying to tell about some good qualities of Flash. So it can do things faster than other platforms similar to it. So what? I just don't see how these adjectives make an ad. --<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECherryT_a3dd.html" title="User:CherryT">CherryT</a> 00:11, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I disagree. Macromedia Flash is an authoring environment which generates binray SWF files that can be run in the Flash Player. It also can generate files unrelated to the Flash player, such as GIFs. Moreover, Flash is not the only such tool: Laszlo, Flex, Swift3D, Illustrator, and many many more also have a similar capability, i.e. to generate SWF files which run in the Flash player.</dd>

<dd>Sorry, backtrack. Yes, I checked it out thoroughly and the beta is going to be rebranded Adobe. I changed the article to reflect that clearly. However, since the Wikipedia article is mainly about the official, released, supported, endorsed Flash Player and not the hacker beta, the title of the article needs to remain Macromedia Flash Player until an OFFICIAL version is released that is branded Adobe. The product is NOT "now called Adobe," as you said. The product is Macromedia. It WILL be Adobe in the near future, and the company has given us a preview of it, but it is incorrect to call the product "Adobe" yet. 68.148.168.84 05:41, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>"Although Macromedia has been acquired by by Adobe, the software is still known as "Macromedia Flash Player", not "Adobe Flash Player", contrary to some speculation."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well then why on earth is the article title 'Adobe Flash Player'? It's like an encyclopedia having an entry under 'Cotton War of 1823' that says 'Despite speculation to the contrary, the Cotton War actually occurred in 1805'.</p>
<p>Update: I checked on the download page <a href="http://www.adobe.com/downloads/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.adobe.com/downloads/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, where ALL Macromedia products are still listed as Macromedia. The name has not yet been changed. Someone jumped the gun. I'm moving this article back. It's still Macromedia Flash Player.</p>
<p>Edit: The original reason for this move was the Beta page (<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/public_beta/" class="external free" title="http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/public_beta/" rel="nofollow">http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/public_beta/</a>). I read through this carefully. The only company reference is at the end, where it says "Thank you, The Adobe Flash Player Team". It seems to me one of two things might have happened: 1) The Team from Adobe that works on Flash thanks you for downloading the Flash Player. This is supported by the fact that everywhere else in the article the player is referred to as simply 'Flash Player'. In this case, the name change is not official. 2) The name has been changed to Adobe Flash Player in the beta. Even if this is the case, it seems to me that until the final product comes out, the name of the article at Wikipedia should not be changed because it is not yet official enough. It can certainly be mentioned, of course.</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<p>Do you know of anything without limitations? This seems meaningless to me.</p>

<p>NO AUDIO IN FLASH SITES SUCH AS YOUTUBE OR MYSPACE Many Windows XP, Internet Explorer and Firefox users have experienced audio problems after installing Adobe Flash Player 9. Adobe has not fixed this problem as of 10 March 2007. However a solution that solves the problem for many was published in this forum by the user Gilhooley:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/webforums/forum/messageview.cfm?forumid=44&amp;catid=184&amp;threadid=1175007&amp;enterthread=y" class="external free" title="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/webforums/forum/messageview.cfm?forumid=44&amp;catid=184&amp;threadid=1175007&amp;enterthread=y" rel="nofollow">http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/webforums/forum/messageview.cfm?forumid=44&amp;catid=184&amp;threadid=1175007&amp;enterthread=y</a></p>
<p>BilalM summarized the instructions as follows:</p>
<p>1. Open registry editor by going to Start menu, Run, typing regedit and then Enter. 2. In the registry editor, navigate through the tree in the left pane til you reach My Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Drivers32 4. On the right pane, right click and click on New, select String value, enter "wavemapper" (without quotes of course), ENTER, type "msacm32.drv", ENTER. 5. Close the editor. No need to restart. Open IE and test Video on MySpace or YouTube.</p>
