<p>The recent edits of Molobo could be perceived nationalistic, because they carry an implicit claim by one country to another's territory; I may be wrong. However, there is no reason to Polonize these names. If the massacre is known in English by its Polish name, link the massacre (i.e. Massacre of Ponary), not the modern Lithuanian town of Paneriai. <a href="../../../p/o/n/Ponary.html" title="Ponary">Ponary</a> is in any case a redirect to <a href="../../../p/a/n/Paneriai.html" title="Paneriai">Paneriai</a>, so the reason Molobo is giving for Polonizing the name of the town doesn't make any kind of sense. - <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalgacus_587c.html" title="User:Calgacus">Calgacus</a> 23:45, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I see you're a friendly chap. Please be courteous, because otherwise, I won't bother interacting with you. His name, forename and surname, are German (not just German sounding); and I would suggest the onus (i.e. burden of proof) is on you Molobo to prove that he isn't of German descent. The alternative is that his family at some point abandoned their Polish name, and moreover, that his parents were sufficiently Germanophile that, without even having German descent, they gave their son a German name in addition, and that Adolf, moreover, was never inclined to have it Polonized. Maybe someone can give me a reason why I'm wrong? - <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalgacus_587c.html" title="User:Calgacus">Calgacus</a> 23:45, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

These influences have been caused by various factors ranging from fascination with other cultures (borrowings from French) to historical processes such as the partitions (borrowings from German and Russian) or accepting Christianity (borrowings from Latin). Latin started to influence Polish in the Middle Ages. When Polish statehood and Christian order were established, the language incorporated religious and liturgical vocabulary, often via Czech and German (e.g. anioł [angel], msza [mass]). Today this influence is limited mainly to scientific jargon. Words of German origin were borrowed particularly in the 19th century as a result of the policy of Germanization. It would be difficult to imagine modern Polish without such obvious lexical calques as czasopismo (magazine, after the German Zeitschrift), dworzec kolejowy (railway station, after Bahnhof) and owiatopoglšd (world view, after Weltanschauung). --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 00:04, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>- Fascinating. But there were millions of actual Germans in early twentieth century Poland, I'm curious why you think it unlikely. Well, I'll go to the library and find a source that proves it; you better hope it doesn't turn out that he's actually an ethnic German.&#160;:) - <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalgacus_587c.html" title="User:Calgacus">Calgacus</a> 00:11, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>you better hope it doesn't turn out that he's actually an ethnic German.</i> Why&#160;? If he was I don't mind. Why should I care&#160;?

<dd>It's hardly just personal opinion. But the fact you're taking it so seriously (combined with your desire to Polonize the name of a Lithuanian town) makes me think it likely you'd be upset by the discovery. Maybe I'm wrong. But I won't restore <i>German descent</i> (which he obviously had), until I get a source.

<dd>German forename, German surname, knowledge of the ethnographic situation in modern Polish history, etc. As to the census: Probably both. It doesn't matter though, we don't go trolling through censi in order to find out what to call one town when. That is the name of the town, both in Lithuanian and English. It doesn't matter that it was once partly inhabited by Germans or Poles or whoever. - <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalgacus_587c.html" title="User:Calgacus">Calgacus</a> 00:24, 30 January 2006 (UTC</dd>

<p><i>knowledge of the ethnographic situation in modern Polish history</i> Hmm you found the information that German words were borrowed fascinating-and this is rather basic knowledge.Excuse me If I am doubtfull.</p>
<p>I don't think descent is that important. He might be German, or Jewish (I saw one page listing him as a Jewish mathematcian).

<p>You didn't answer my questions: Ponary isn't used in English for the name of the town&#160;? Are you saying that Paneriai is an English name&#160;? Since you claim that the name should be named after country it is in, then it would follow that it would be German or Polish name depending upon which country you believe had legal rights over the town at the time. --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 00:55, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It usually is. You can only use the historical name when there is an absence of a common English name, in which case you put the current local name in brackets upon first mention. If you think that the modern English name Paneriai (you have no case for Vilnius) isn't common enough, you have to give good reasoning as to why Ponary, rather than Paneriai or Ponaren, is a good historical name for the period in question. - <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalgacus_587c.html" title="User:Calgacus">Calgacus</a> 01:04, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
