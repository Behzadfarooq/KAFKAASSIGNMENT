<h2><span class="mw-headline">Final version and POV tag</span></h2>
<p>I think we can remove the POV tag once these two lines are decided on, as they seem to be the only ones under dispute. The following is my version which is open to stylistic but not major semantic modification.</p>
<p><i>Hitler gained popularity through his charismatic oratory, often appealing to German nationalism, anti-Semitism, and promises of economic improvement. Once in power, he applied propaganda along with para-military violence in public to establish an efficient totalitarian state with almost no domestic resistance.</i></p>

<p>Please calm down, guys. I want to suggest the following rewording:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hitler came to power in a Germany plagued by political and economic crisis, using his (political skills and) <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charismatic_authority.html" title="Charismatic authority">charismatic</a> oratory, appealing to <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalism.html" title="Nationalism">nationalism</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">anti-Semitism</a>. He established a <a href="../../../t/o/t/Totalitarianism.html" title="Totalitarianism">totalitarian</a> state based on <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a> and coercion.</dd>
<dd>After the <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economic_system.html" title="Economic system">economy</a> had recovered and the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military.html" title="Military">military</a> rearmed, <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_Germany_add9.html" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> started <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> and during the height of its power, Germany and her <a href="../../../a/x/i/Axis_Powers_169f.html" title="Axis Powers">allies</a> occupied much of <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>. The <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_policy_of_Nazi_Germany_b7c8.html" title="Racial policy of Nazi Germany">racial policies</a> that Hitler directed culminated in an immense number of deaths across Europe, commonly cited as about 11 million people, including about 6 million <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jews</a>, in a <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genocide.html" title="Genocide">genocide</a> now known as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Holocaust_8edb.html" title="The Holocaust">the Holocaust</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I am undecided on the "political skills" (though keen is overdoing it), as I am not sure what these skills are except for rhetoric, charisma, and playing va-banque. But never mind.</p>
<p>I removed the "effective", as the Hitler state was many things but not effective.</p>
<p>I also reincluded the economic issue (both as crisis and as recovery), but without sounding as praise. I also included the actual start of the war, as the former version just suddenly plunged and was in the middle of the war.</p>
<p>Any suggestions for making it more concise are of course welcome. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 00:44, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

I don't think this was done under appropriate WP authority but I've little hope he'll ever agree with that.</s> Either way, yeah, I guess there are folks who think AH had no political skill, no significant popular appeal and was into brutality and violence for their own sakes. I mean, why regard him as the frighteningly talented piece of human complexity and moral irresponsibility that he was, when one can avoid all those inconvenient and uncomfortable subtleties and sum him up as frickin' <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darth_Vader_35c8.html" title="Darth Vader">Darth Vader</a> or whatever? <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 01:10, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It seems people don't really read the Talk page here, yet have the temerity to edit self-righteously . Repeating myself:
<ul>
<li>Good, so we can remove "schadenfreude". And Wyss, about "keen political skills", let's quote your own words - <i>If it's so generally held, finding a suitable citation in a secondary source by a peer-reviewed author shouldn't be much trouble.</i> (ie not just a handful of web pages.) As with charisma, it's not the inclusion that's being debated so much as its relevance next to other factors that are <i>already mentioned</i> and provide <i>more specific information.</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>As for the use of the word coercion: "coercion" implies that people were being forced into doing something specific. In fact, apart from the public humiliation in which Jews were forced to clean latrines in front of crowds etc, people were not being "coerced" - they were being beaten up, deported or killed. That's why I used "violence." -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 01:36, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Violence is a broader and more accurate category than "coercion"; it's like the difference between saying Hitler ruled Germany and Hitler ruled Bavaria. The analogy being that you want to insist that since Hitler ruled Bavaria, he couldn't have ruled Germany too. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 02:02, 1 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Truth be told I think coercion is the broader category. Lots of Germans complied (or, say, "adapted") because it was easier than getting one's head lopped off or starving to death in a Gestapo cell or concentration camp. The <i>implied threat</i> of violence is a much wider and more efftive tool than violence itself. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 02:08, 1 February 2006 (UTC)\</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>You wouldn't have so many semantic troubles if you actually knew something on the subject. There wasn't just an implied threat, there was a lot of documented violence, and it's an important aspect of Nazism. It's more important than unspecified "keen political skills" anyway so stop removing it. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 02:22, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hitler rose to power amidst deep economic and political crisis by promises of economic improvement. He used charismatic oratory and propaganda to appeal to popular nationalist and anti-Semitic sentiments.

<p>Hanuka, how is "violence" POV - I think the actions of the SA clearly constitue violence. Beating up (or worse) opponents, attacking rival party meetings etc. Propaganda may sound bad, but it isn't a derogatory term in itself, and in fact derives much of its negative connotation from the Nazis. But I am willing to discuss working alternatives. My objective was to include something that gave the substance of Nazi/Fascist rule - in Mussolini's case the two pillars are "consensus and terror" (though there was considerably less terror in Italy). <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 09:31, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>My objections</p>
<ol>
<li>violence and coercion are both included. And all along people were trying to exclude one or the other because of excessive POV - can we just remove coercion?</li>
<li>As for WW2, it's a bit simplistic to say the Germans "started" it as there is some debate over what was exactly the "start" of the war - the main article on <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> itself goes into that.</li>
<li>It seems even longer than the earlier version.</li>
</ol>
<p>And this is an observation - people kept arguing that Hitler was only portrayed negatively, yet by putting economic/military recovery in passive one downplays Hitler's role (I'm fine with that but I wondered why no one else objects to it.) I'll make slight tweaks and suggestions are welcome. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 17:42, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is good, I would add one thing also - Germany's defeat by the Allies was a;sp directly attributatble to Hitler's style of leadership. Hitler ran a chaotic nation, in which he deliberately had his subordinates working at cross purposes and in competition with each other, to ensure Hitler remained at the top of the chain. If someone can think of a one sentence summation of that notion, it would be appropriate here. Something like</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the height of its power, Germany and her <a href="../../../a/x/i/Axis_Powers_169f.html" title="Axis Powers">allies</a> occupied much of <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>, but ultimately, Germany was defeated by the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allies.html" title="Allies">Allied powers</a> in 1945. Hitler exercised personal control over major facets of the German economy, military, and government, by 1942 having supreme political power as well as supreme command of the Army. His style of leadership, encouraging subordinates to compete needlessly, and the chaotic reporting lines in the country led to an extremely inefficient economy which, coupled with Hitler's poor attempts at grand strategy and an effective coalition of overwhelming material resources by Germany's enemies, ultimately led to their defeat. The Second World War in Europe was ultimately "Hitler's War" for it was he who personally instigated the war, prosecuted the war, and shaped Germany's participation.</p>

<p>The intro still has problems. Use of the word <i>violence</i> in the context of a <a href="../../../t/o/t/Totalitarian.html" title="Totalitarian">totalitarian</a> <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictator.html" title="Dictator">dictator</a> is redundant and unencyclopedic because it gives the appearance of PoV, even if bias is not actually present in the article. Second, the lack of any mention of AH's widely documented political ability (some editors may mistakenly believe that political ability is in itself a positive, admirable trait) is conspicuous in its absence and third, parts of the intro suffer from very weak syntax and style. Minor nitpick to <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Dorosh_6aa0.html" title="User:Michael Dorosh">Michael Dorosh</a>'s interesting remarks: To characterise the 1939-45 war as "Hitler's War" is tempting, however it is also speculative in the sense that we can't be assured a second world war in Europe could have been avoided if only AH hadn't been in power. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 20:19, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Respectfully suggesting this replacement for the middle paragraph of the intro:
<ul>
<li><i>Hitler assumed power in a time of political and economic crisis for the German state. Through his use of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charismatic_authority.html" title="Charismatic authority">charismatic</a> oratory he appealed to the electorate, with an emphasis on the need for economic revitalisation, while urging the people to accept state policies that derived from <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalism.html" title="Nationalism">nationalism</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">anti-Semitism</a>. By way of effective <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paramilitary.html" title="Paramilitary">paramilitary</a> violence, a <a href="../../../t/o/t/Totalitarianism.html" title="Totalitarianism">totalitarian</a> state was established by his party, with a view to creating the empire of the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_Reich_a799.html" title="Third Reich">Third Reich</a> under the leadership of a <a href="../../../f/u/h/Fuhrer.html" title="Fuhrer">Fuhrer</a>.</i></li>
<li><i>With the surge in <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economic_system.html" title="Economic system">economic activity</a> under his leadership, and the envigoration of the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military.html" title="Military">military</a> establishment during the mid-1930's, Hitler directed the German state's diplomatic relations, to the point of provoking the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">second World War</a>. At the height of its power in 1941, Germany (along with its <a href="../../../a/x/i/Axis_Powers_169f.html" title="Axis Powers">allies</a>) occupied much of <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>, and parts of north Africa, the middle-east and west Asia.</i></li>
<li><i>Hitler took unusual responsibility in determining the strategy and battle plans of the state's <a href="../../../w/e/h/Wehrmacht.html" title="Wehrmacht">army</a>, but in 1945 Germany was defeated by the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allies.html" title="Allies">Allied powers</a>. By then, the <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_policy_of_Nazi_Germany_b7c8.html" title="Racial policy of Nazi Germany">racial policies</a> set by him had culminated in a great number of deaths - the figure commonly cited is of 11 million people, which includes the deaths of 6 million <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jews</a> in a <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genocide.html" title="Genocide">genocide</a> known as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Holocaust_8edb.html" title="The Holocaust">the Holocaust</a>.</i></li>

<dd>I hope this addresses all the points raised in debates going back three months (adding his involvement in military campaigns), but with a better flow than the existing paragraph in the intro.

<dl>
<dd>All right, my thougts on Shtove's suggestion:
<ul>
<li>The general problem is, as Wyss said, that this version is too long for the intro, while the shorter version does the trick of conveying the same info as well.</li>
<li>"Assume" to me sounds to much like taking hold of an apple lying around.</li>
<li>The rest of the sentence is factually ok, but it is too long and offers explanations better left to the article itself.</li>
<li>"with a view to creating" is IMHO only elaborating on what "totalitarian state" means here.</li>
<li>the economic lines gives too much credit to Hitler (or seems to) while stating that Hitler directed diplomacy is stating the obvious. "Provoke" is inaccurate.</li>
<li>His stearing of the military is again stating the obvious and possibly connects his military decisions too close with the defeat. Though Hitler is often portrayed as a military dilitant, he was in fact quite well informed in the military field - his decisions weren't that foolish until this "forward strategy" ran adrift. What really caused the defeat were his political and not his military decisions.</li>

<p>I actually like the current version, though the "coercion and propaganda - totalitarian state" is missing, except for the "provoked World War II" bit. That sounds like Germany provoked others to start the war (as it did in 1870 with Napoleon III), when in fact it was Germany that started the war. Granted the war at the beginning was not a world war, only a German-Polish war, but with France and the UK entering the war after a few days it was a World war. Anyway, we are taking about one war here (WWII) which started on 1 September 1939. Hence I will change "provoke" to "start".</p>
<p>- This is what I wrote before, but it appears that I was looking at an outdated version. Here are some more comments on my edit and the current version:</p>
<p>I changed "Allied powers" to "Anti-Hitler Coalition", for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid the repitition of the word "allied/s", which could suggest and identity. The wording "Axis allies" is awkward and shouldn't be used</li>
<li>I'm not sure whether the Soviet Union was part of the Allied Powers, but it bore a large burden of the war.</li>
<li>Anti-Hitler Coalition is a perfectly common term.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The proper terms are "Axis powers" and "Allies," the latter including the USSR by treaty, the <a href="../../../d/e/c/Declaration_by_United_Nations_298a.html" title="Declaration by United Nations">Declaration by United Nations</a>. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 23:40, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I retained the following passage:</p>
<p><i>He established a <a href="../../../t/o/t/Totalitarianism.html" title="Totalitarianism">totalitarian</a> state through effective <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paramilitary.html" title="Paramilitary">paramilitary</a> violence.</i></p>
<p>Is this passage intended to refer to Hitler's rise to power or to his governing the Third Reich. Paramilitary violence played a part in the former but not in the second case. Coercion or repression are more fitting in the second case.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

<dd>Paramilitary <i>violence</i> is problematic. First, the word is too vague. Second, the mere threat of violence had much sway in Nazi Germany. Third (as I've mentioned before) violence in the context of a totalitarian dictatorship is unremarkable. Use of the term is redundant and creates the impression of bias or emotionalism, even if these aren't editorially present. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 23:40, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm hoping to address the concerns of the reader of this article, rather than those of the contributors. Forgive me, but replacing <i>Allied Powers</i> seems a bit complicated, or recondite, for a WP article. The term <i>violence</i> (paramilitary or otherwise) is one of the <b>bones (of contention) - (see, <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>)</b>. I do know the current intro (2nd para) doesn't read well. This is a big subject - one of WP's most popular - so, let the intro be long and let it be readable. Better that than the disjointed thing we have at the moment. Let <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> hack away at the suggested replacement - prolix and inaccurate as it may be - until they produce something that helps the reader who wants to learn about Adolf Hitler.--<a href="../../../s/h/t/User%7EShtove_8f32.html" title="User:Shtove">shtove</a> 23:53, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Readers of whatever background or bias will inevitably be distracted by an intro that attempts to accomplish too much. In an extreme case, AH's b-d dates, political offices and acknowledged responsibility for the holocaust are likely enough. Once one starts to elaborate beyond that bare framework, the probability of bias, reader irritation, misleading word choices and spin (well meant or otherwise) approaches 1. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 00:03, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I take one of your points. In my historical biogs I cite in the intro - name, DOB/DOD, station/rank/occupation - and then give a single sentence summary of what the subject achieved. It's the last part that proves a problem on this subject, with the lesser or greater degrees of elaboration that <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> demands. My suggested <b>replacement</b> touches on all the "<i>likely</i>" areas, in a style that I consider logical. The reader of this article will have no background or bias - the reader reads. So let the intro be readable (so what if it's long?) and <i>accomplished</i>. And let the contributors relegate their conflicts to the talk page.--<a href="../../../s/h/t/User%7EShtove_8f32.html" title="User:Shtove">shtove</a> 00:30, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Shtove, I changed from Allied powers to Anti-Hitler Coalition (which is just as correct) for a couple of reasons, one being to avoid the repetition and possible confusion. The problem with using "Axis powers" is that does not clearly connect them to Germany and that "and its allies" was flowing better. Also, this change doesn't avoid possible confusion when suddenly "Allies" appear.</dd>

<dd>The word <i>terror</i> is too loaded to use, even here, though terror it was, and violence it was. Coercion can involve either applied or threatened force. Indeed, the force they applied wasn't always so violent, but usually effective enough. The term <i>violent</i> is vague and misleading. While I think the phrase <i>coercion through paramilitary and police power</i> since some readers seem to think that means a polite wink and meek request to clamber into the cattle car or whatever, why bother with it? The body of the article mostly does a very helpful job of explaining how he did all this. Why irritate and distract readers with a dodgy, over-long intro? <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 01:32, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>Sure, Wyss. With "consensus and terror" I was only referring to principle I know from my studies of fascist Italy. I did edit the text to reinclude "propaganda and coercion". It use coercion exactly because it can involve either applied or threatened force. (Actually terror has that dual nature as well, as it refers to the fear caused, but unfortunately many associated terror with the violence itself and wouldn't distinguish, say, terrorist attacks from assasinations). Again I agree about the length. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 01:39, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wyss, I never disputed that the terms you use are standard. I was concerned for the flow and the possible confusion. But I won't push this issue.

<dd>Nonsense? I've cited the terms. Anyway you've now got the word <i>power</i> in that sentence three times and it'll never stick stylistically. Truth be told, part of the skill of writing these articles is using accepted terminologies in a smooth and seamless narrative flow. Please reassure me and say you didn't deliberately use the word 3x to make a point?

<dd>No, I wasn't trying to make a point by using "powers" (I didn't count it, though I liekd the parallel structure Axis Powers vs. Allied Powers). I just think Allies, accurate or not, a bit too vague. It might be the official term but as such it was used by the Allies and the Allies knew whom they were allied to. "Allied Powers" makes it clearer that we are not talking about some allies but a specific group of that name.

<dd>Trust me, in the context of 1939-45, <i>Allies</i> and <i>Axis powers</i> have ultra precise, stark, standard and widely understood meanings&#160;:) <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 01:50, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Er, you don't have to trust me, click on the wikified cites above. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 01:51, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I trust you and I know that these are precise. I was just concerned about the flow.</dd>
<dd>However, I don't understand what you mean by wikified cites. The articles on "Axis powers" and "Allies" (actually "Allies of World War II")? Or the link to the UN Declaration - I can't find the words "Allies" or "Axis" in there)?</dd>
<dd>Are these two actually the official terms of the alliances in question? Axis isn't really, as the Axis never was and never was intended as a formal alliance, rather Mussolini's surrogate for such an alliance while he was still contemplating. Is Allies an official term.</dd>
<dd>Or are these terms used by historians? I know Axis Powers are, and Allies are too, but I have also read Allied Powers. We should ask a native speaking historian, as my first language is German. There we'd have "Achsenmächte" and "Alliierte" (which doesn't creat the "Allies vs. allies" problem). <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a></dd>

<p>In Anglo-Saxon culture (English), these were and are the "official" terms. Newspapers and radio at the time used them, history books still use them, every biography of every person from that time I've read uses them and lastly, everyone I've ever known who was alive then and has spoken to me about it in English has used the terms... <i>Allies</i> and <i>Axis (powers)</i>. I've heard and read variations in French and German but this is the En WP.</p>
<p>The article <a href="../../../d/e/c/Declaration_by_United_Nations_298a.html" title="Declaration by United Nations">Declaration by United Nations</a> explains the legal treaty that bound them (it was the genesis of the present day UN by the bye) and goes on to say that they were referred to as the <i>Allies</i>. The article <a href="../../../a/x/i/Axis_powers.html" title="Axis powers">Axis powers</a> does a similar job (though after the essentials, towards the end, someone dumped in some incoherent machine translation gunk).</p>
<p>Yes, sometimes you will see <i>Allied powers</i> but not nearly as often.</p>
<p>In 40s era lit one will often see <i>Axis</i> used stand-alone. I think I've even seen this in comic books from the period (I'm a Betty and Veronica fan, Archie got his start in something called "Pep" comics during the era and I've seen several of them). <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 02:33, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm not sure I fully understand the argument here. "Allies" is a standard term, and if capitalized, can be understood to be a proper noun referring to the anti-German powers in World War II. That said, I think Str is right that the particular usage in question is a bit awkward. I'd prefer "Allied powers." "Germany was defeated by the Allies," with no context, just sounds awkward to me. I'd also make the side point that Wyss is most certainly wrong to say that any other terminology is "unsupported by the historical record." During World War II itself, the most commonly used term for the Allies was "the United Nations." For obvious reasons of ambiguity and confusion, this has not been used by historians. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 05:16, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's why they call them the <i>Allies</i> in this context. I'm not making this stuff up&#160;:) <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 14:18, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Surely not. But "Allied Powers" would further forestall confusion - is that term really so outrageous? <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 14:21, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This whole dispute sounds like a tempest in a teacup. I don't think the standard term 'Allies' is so vague that we need to invent a similar neologism like 'Allied Powers'. But 'Allied powers' sounds ok too. I could go either way, but without capitalizing Powers when talking about the Allies. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesley_19bf.html" title="User:Wesley">Wesley</a> 14:32, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Truly... the standard, widely understood terms in English for the two combatant groups of countries during the 1939-45 war are <i>Allies</i> and <i>Axis powers</i>. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 14:43, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's nothing wrong with the term "Allies," but I repeat that it seems awkward in the particular context of the disputed sentence. What's wrong with "Allied powers"? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 21:28, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
