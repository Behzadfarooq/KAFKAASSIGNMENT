<dd>Will the <a href="../../../w/e/l/Wikipedia%7EWelcoming_Committee_d01f.html" title="Wikipedia:Welcoming Committee">Wikipedia:Welcoming Committee</a> let new users know that this sort of assistance is available? I tend to think that it might be one of the few ways that a newcomer would know it is possible. Also, I do have some reservations about the word "adopt", as it could be perceived as vaguely insulting to the newcomer. Maybe "coach" or "tutor" or something like that might work better. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 19:31, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Interesting idea, it would be nice to see newbies have easier access to personal help. I'm not sure what tone you want to establish, but I have to say that "adopt" did seem a bit inappropriate to me as well. Coach or tutor sounds a little less intimate to me. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookandcoffee_bb60.html" title="User:Bookandcoffee">Bookandcoffee</a> 16:55, 29 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It <b>definitely</b> plays up the "baby" aspect of the "adoption" process. Personally, I'm not sure that I'd want to use it myself, as I think I'm a bit more "adult" than the picture is. I still think that something like a "big brother/big sister," "tutor", "coach" or the like might get more newcomers to actually use it. Maybe something like this:</dd>

<p>Yeah, it could use a better image, but that's the idea.

<dd>I would hope the answer to this could be "yes". I'm thinking that if someone were, for instance, involved in adding information on insects and the politics of the Ivory Coast, that they might benefit from having "mentors" (I like that word better) from each of the fields in which they are involved, if there is no single person involved in both fields available. Also, it would definitely be useful if someone's designated "adoptor" were to go on an extended break for whatever reason to have someone else already familiar with the newcomer available to step in immediately. Lastly, if we have a true saint who can deal with several newcomers at once, I would definitely want them to be able to do so. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 23:50, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hmm...Well, it technically isn't supposed to be a userbox, it's supposed to be at the top of your userpage. But yeah, if it would be used as a userbox, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conformity.html" title="Conformity">then it should look more like a normal userbox</a>. It should be more userboxy, if you will. I was thinking that we could go both ways and include two versions of each template; one for the top of the page and one for a userbox.</p>
<p>The "adopt me" and "I'm adopting" templates are supposed to be big and at the top of the page to get your attention, <i>but</i> the "I adopted" and "I got adopted" templates don't neccesitize attention-grabbing tactics; actually, they're kind of annoying. So, hypothetically, the "seeking adopting" templates would be big and the "I'm a happy camper" templates would be nice, non-blatant userboxes (although everyone might not want to conform to that).</p>

<p>Not something I do often. I am thinking that we should find a way to publicise ( excuse my misspellings ) the whole program. I agree that maybe it could use a new name, although I like the <a href="../../../a/d/o/WP%7EADOPT_c4e7.html" title="WP:ADOPT">WP:ADOPT</a> shortcut. If we find experienced editors and asked them if they would be interested in joining, and also send new users a message asking them to join, and maybe get one of the welcome templates changed so that it includes something about <a href="../../../a/d/o/WP%7EADOPT_c4e7.html" title="WP:ADOPT">WP:ADOPT</a>. I think that we need to make the project page more user-friendly before we get it added to a welcome message, as new users inexperienced in Wikipedia will be using it frequently.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Notifying new users of Adopt-a-User</span></h2>
<p>Is it permissible to inform new (good) users of the existence of Adopt-a-User, and recommend them to join? I notice many good new users out there who need help, but don't know that this project exists, and would probably benefit the most from it. –- <strong><a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKungming2_bd1a.html" title="User:Kungming2"><font color="blue">kungming·</font></a><font color="green">2</font></strong> <a href="../../../k/u/n/User_talk%7EKungming2_b479.html" title="User talk:Kungming2"><font color="#999999"><sup>(Talk)</sup></font></a> 07:57, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Absolutely. I have adopted two users, and since doing so, which is not all that long, I have had three new editors come to me with perfectly sensible questions which an adopter could have helped them with. I sorted them out, of course, but my point is that they were wholly unaware of the <a href="../../../a/d/o/WP%7EADOPT_c4e7.html" title="WP:ADOPT">WP:ADOPT</a> scheme.--<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony.bradbury_30fb.html" title="User:Anthony.bradbury">Anthony.bradbury</a> 14:27, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have also adopted two users (though unfortunately one turned out to be a sockppuppet of a permanently banned user) but found they weere both relatively experienced. Adoption should be targeted to the newest of users - and I see no problem in proactive in getting new adoptees A.Bradbury. If you dont want more adoptions you can always point them to WP:Adopt</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>See above, but I did recommend that WP:Adopt be part of the welcome template. OR we could change some of the warning templates to get more adoptions (though this might lead to more vandalism).

<dd>I was(am) adopted by <a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethaniol_f0fa.html" title="User:Lethaniol">Lethaniol the adopting god</a>, and I guess my editing style was, well, as he put it "relatively experienced". To be honest, I was not all that experienced, but with Lethaniol's help, I quickly learned some of the "tricks of the trade" on how to become a better editor. The most important thing that Lethaniol taught me was that I should be ALWAYS ready to learn something new from ANYONE trustable and more experienced.</dd>
<dd>I took his advise and learned from the admin of the US History project, among others. Lethaniol really was(is) a GREAT mentor - I'm <b>very glad</b> that he adopted me and was willing to put up with my somewhat, um, <i>unique</i>, sense of humor and writing style....</dd>

<dd>1.a.: Decide whether the "rules" are actually rule or guidelines, if we want them. Also figure out how strict, how to enforce them, how to decide "punishment"/"reward", etc.</dd>
<dd>1.b.: Decide when to start to enforce them and create deadline for discussion to end.</dd>
<dd>2.a.: If rules/guidelines don't become accepted, decide how this project is to be run</dd>

</li>
<li>To increase Adoption awareness - by advertisement e.g. Wikipedia Newsletter, word of mouth and links to the project from places where new users will see e.g. help pages, welcome template etc...
<dl>
<dd>To increase number of adoptees to over 100 and adopters to over 50, currently 68 adoptees and 30 adopters at 15:02, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Figure out how to advertise and increase numbers.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Maybe create a page or common problems for new users and a place where a new user can post a question to <i>all</i> adopters. Kind of like the Help Desk or the {{{helpme}} but specifically to us (also have specific help instead of leaving a template on their talk). On this page we should have the question, the answer, and other comments or further questions posed which stemmed from this question. We should also have the answer left on the new user's talk page to make sure they get it.
<dl>
<dd>We probably should tell them how to respond to the user who helped them here because I've met some new users who didn't know how to do this.
<dl>
<dd>From an adoptee POV, what about naming the adoptee help desk {{{adopteehelp}}}? Appropriate, and easy to remember.... <a href="../../../n/d/c/User%7ENDCompuGeek_acac.html" title="User:NDCompuGeek">NDCompuGeek</a> 20:49, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Should we have something specific to do once we've adopted? I've been asking my adoptees if they need any help, so far with no reply, but maybe, as been mentioned before, we should have a certain page for questions as well as the adopters' talk pages. The only problem with this is that it would quickly become something like the Newcomers' Help Page, so what would be different about this page that would merit its creation? This also gets over the sort of awkwardness of personally contacting someone.

<p>Hi guys - I am going to act on this soon unless there is some major issues.</p>
<p>I think a subpage where Adopters can put there experiences down, how they dealt with it, and whether anyone has any suggestions would be a good. I think this should be separate from the talk page, so that it is easier to navigate and does not get archived (would be able to manually sort it into different categories of problems).</p>
<p>In case any one is interested - I will be adding my dealings with suspected sockpupper adoptees - my first adoptee was banned for being a sockpuppet of a user who was banned for issueing death threats , my third adoptee is in the process of having a sockpuppet action gaining force againist them.

Should I "drop" them? This should probably be moved to that page.

<dd>Hey I don't think there is any hard and fast rules as yet. Personally if I had 2 relatively inactive users, I would keep them on as Adoptees, and adopt others if I wanted. I don't think it is about how many adoptions you have, but about being able to help out the adoptee out appropriately. So if you take on a high-maintenance Adoptee it would be irresponsible and unfair to take on another until that one finds it feet. If you have x mature Adoptee who only need occasional help you may feel you can take on another. Hope that helps</dd>

<dd>I think these are some really good ideas.

<dd>I think we should keep it this way, though I must say, I would have liked it to ention "Diary" because that is a place where one is able to record their experiences... But this diary would be accessible to the public so they can use it as an "advise column". Should we sort it (meaning the Experiences page) all into "Adoptee issues", "Adopter issues", "Both" or something like that. For example, what we have currently could be cassified under "Adoptee isssues".... —<font style="background:white" size="1"><i><b><a href="../../../%C2%A1/_/_/%C2%A1.html" title="¡">¡</a></b></i><a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandfan_08ca.html" title="User:Randfan"><font face="Vivaldi" color="darkblue">Rand</font></a><a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERandfan_2a35.html" title="User talk:Randfan"><font face="Times" color="darkred">fan</font></a><a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandfan_Esperanza_7da0.html" title="User:Randfan/Esperanza"><font face="FlutedGermanica" color="SeaGreen"><i>!</i></font></a></font> 21:36, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the name's fine- I see what you mean about how adoption implies more of a permanent thing, but on the project page we can see it's not.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Excessive adoption?</span></h2>
<p>I have come across a user, or to be fair the user has been pointed out to me, who has adopted seven new users. The Adopter in question whom i will name on this page if any editor asks me to, has a total of 448 edits of all kinds at this time. I question whether this indicates a broad enough basis of experience to adopt anyone, let alone seven. One of his/her adoptees has come to me with help with a problem, being unable to get advice elsewhere.</p>
<p>I really feel that we should set minimum standards of experience for adopters. I know that this has been discussed elsewhere, but it needs to looked at urgently. I would suggest not less than 1,500 edits, excluding edits to the editor's own pages; at least six months editing; and no blocks (except fault-free autoblocks) for at least six months. There should also be a limit of say three adoptees per adopter at any one time.

<dd>I think you set your standards are very high - if you got time also comment at <a href="../../../a/d/o/Wikipedia_talk%7EAdopt-a-User_Criteria_Discussion_fo_exact_rules_e075.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Adopt-a-User/Criteria/Discussion fo exact rules">Wikipedia talk:Adopt-a-User/Criteria/Discussion fo exact rules</a> we can help push through the standards we expect of Adopters. I think the real issues that will come out of it are:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>How long part of/how many edits/in what areas of wikipedia do we expect of our Adopters?</li>
<li>Are they rules or guidelines?</li>
<li>If we make them rules how do we enforce?</li>
<li>If we make them guidelines when do we tell an adoptee / adopter about an inappropriate situation</li>
<li>And finally who has the dirty job of doing this enforcement.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>In this case Anthony, I suppose I would suggest having a chat with the Adopter concerned - being honest that a concern has been raised, but ask how the adoption process is working for them - without being to aggressive (blimey am I saying that?!?!)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Categories</span></h2>
<p>The cateogries are a great way to find people involved with wikipedia or people to adopt, but we have to be careful to keep project pages out of them. I recently edited <a href="../../../a/d/o/Wikipedia%7EAdopt-a-User_Templates_cfbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Adopt-a-User/Templates">Wikipedia:Adopt-a-User/Templates</a> to effectively subst the templates and keep them, as well as edit the main project page to remove another incorrect category link. Please keep these things in mind and always remember to change the {{<a href="../../../a/d/o/Template%7EAdoptme_a6f6.html" title="Template:Adoptme">Adoptme</a>}} userbox to <span style="font-family:monospace;">{{<a href="../../../a/d/o/Template%7EAdoptee_68c5.html" title="Template:Adoptee">adoptee</a>|Your Username}}</span> when adopting so that other adopters don't get confused and accidentally try to adopt a user who's already been adopted.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Absent adopter</span></h2>
<p>Hello everyone, I’ve been recently adopted by a very nice and helpful adopter, but the problem is that he’s paying very little attention to me. I was adopted over a month ago and so far he responds to my queries after an average of 3 to 4 days, last massage was posted a week ago, and to this moment didn’t receive an answer. The adopter is very kind and informative, but since I’m here almost everyday I’d rather have someone more available to adopt me. I don’t know what I can do about it, I don’t want to offend my adopter. Does anyone have any suggestions?

<dd>My suggestion = explain to your adopter that though they are really helpful, that because they are not on all the time, but you are, that you would like a co-adopter (a second user to adopt you), so you can ask that user a questions if the other is not around. A number of adoptees have more than one adopter - either to help out a new adopter, or because an adopter is not around all that often. So if you want a second adopter - just put the <a href="../../../a/d/o/Template%7EAdoptme_a6f6.html" title="Template:Adoptme">Template:Adoptme</a> back on your userpage, check with any new adopter that they are on regularly, and away you go.

<p>Just a reminder that we've created a page for adopters to relate their experiences on Wikipedia, which can then be discussed and questions asked.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Page of adopters</span></h2>
<p>I think there should be a page here that lists all the users willing to adopt. It can have a "status" whereas they may not want to take on new adoptions for whatever reason (too busy IRL, too many adopters, etc) but would also list what they are especially good at here on Wikipedia and a "sales" pitch perhaps. That way new users can go "shopping" for an adopter on this list and not just sit and wait around for someone to post on their talk page, though that certainly could be how some do it and there's nothing wrong with it. At a minimum it should have the adopter's username, link to user page, status and a space avaiable for the adopter to write what they want, but they don't have to.

<dd>I think there is some merit in this idea. Am currently busy with other aspects with Adopt-a-User, but if someone would design and promote such a page I would add my details there.

<dd>I think this idea is a good one- it means the adopter and adoptee are more similar- for instance, if an adoptee wanted to know more about vandal fighting, they'd choose a user that did a lot of that. However we have to advertise it a lot more and change the adoption userboxes to fit this page in- just some re-wording. I'll be glad to get started on the pages, though- any thoughts on the page name?

<dd>Do you think it might be sensible routinely to survey our adoptees, say a month after adoption ,to find out what they expected from adoption and whether they got it?--<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony.bradbury_30fb.html" title="User:Anthony.bradbury">Anthony.bradbury</a> 21:46, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes and no. In the near future once have fully developed Adopter's Area and <a href="../../../a/d/o/Wikipedia%7EAdopt-a-User_Adoptee%27s_Area_ae69.html" title="Wikipedia:Adopt-a-User/Adoptee's Area">Adoptee's Area</a> - hopefully this next week - will leave a message on all Adopters and Adoptees talk pages linking to the new areas and asking them to contribute their experiences. So that should do for getting a survey and input of the current Adoptees.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In the future though I am not sure. Am already keeping track on all new Adopters at <a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethaniol_Adopters_3220.html" title="User:Lethaniol/Adopters">User:Lethaniol/Adopters</a>, keeping track of all Adoptees will be even harder work! Maybe should change the Adoptee template to encourage them to use the <a href="../../../a/d/o/WP%7EADOPT_c4e7.html" title="WP:ADOPT">WP:ADOPT</a> pages or we could request that all Adopters after a month contact their Adoptee for feedback. But unless someone physically communicates with all the adoptees on their talkpages I think it will be difficult. Maybe we need to rely on the Adoptee to bring us a problem if there is one - see example a few sections above here. Also Adopters could be damaging if they don't help out their Adoptee but at the end of the day that won't stop their access to Wikipedia or its many other support mechanisms.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So the conclusion I come to is - generally no contact from Adopt-a-user centrally. Request Adopters encourage their Users to contribute here.

<dd>I was actually planning to send out a happy holidays notice to my adoptees, reminding them that I was always there to help. The way I see it, the important part of this program is not to create a good social bond between members (that's what got esperanza MfD'd) but to always have someone to turn to when you have a question. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Olsen_0313.html" title="User:Daniel Olsen">Daniel Olsen</a> 00:16, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Just to clarify - I totally agree with Daniel - it is the individual relationships that matter. But if things go wrong, or a adoptee wants other support they need to be aware of the <a href="../../../a/d/o/WP%7EADOPT_c4e7.html" title="WP:ADOPT">WP:ADOPT</a> central area where they can ask. Again see section a few above where one such Adoptee did.

<dd>As an <b>adoptee</b> of the program, I feel that my adopter really did and is helping and encouraging me to reach out of my 'comfort zone' and try new things. For instance, even though I have only been actively editing for about two months, I have already started a portal, done significant edits for the US Military History task force, and tried my hand at template-making. If it were not for the assistance of my adopter, I definitely would not have even tried these things, let alone successfully wrote these articles and activated this portal.</dd>
<dd>My adopter has also taught me some of the basics of the Wikipedia philosophy, the most notable (that I got out of it) was that the article does not belong to me - I must let others make edits and let the community rule by consensus, not by the 'since I started the article, it's mine, and I won't let anyone else edit it' rule. He has also taught me that if I see something that needs fixing, just go ahead and fix it - be bold, but get the references!</dd>
<dd>I can see where Gnevin may be coming from. There are those that might become overly reliant on their adopter, not try new things, and not grow their abilities. In my opinion, the AaU program helps this kind of user to get more familiar with their comfort zone things, and with this familiarity become more willing and able to do more things sooner on the Wikipedia site.</dd>
<dd>In summary, yes, I probably needed a little 'mothering' to get me out of my initial "stagefright" and get to editing, but once I was encouraged to stretch my wings and write, my adopter has and is a great asset that I am very glad that I have. <a href="../../../n/d/c/User%7ENDCompuGeek_acac.html" title="User:NDCompuGeek">NDCompuGeek</a> 15:58, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Urgent Proposal - New Users seeking Adoption...</span></h2>
<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>There is plenty of people looking to be adopted, so get to it. Anyway to the proposal:</p>
<p>As Adopt-a-user is becoming more popular, the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedians_seeking_to_be_adopted_in_Adopt-a-user_d05c.html" title="Category:Wikipedians seeking to be adopted in Adopt-a-user">Category:Wikipedians seeking to be adopted in Adopt-a-user</a> is filling up fast. I am sure I am not the only one to notice that sometimes people create an account, use the adoptme template, and never return. Also people may get contacted by a few adopters, but still lag in removing the Adoptme template. So to try and make the Category easier for wannbe Adopters to use I suggest removing the Adoptme Template in the following circumstances -</p>
<ol>
<li>With a new user, who has had very few edits, who adds the Adoptme template, and then over the next 3 days makes no further edits.</li>
<li>A new user, who has been contacted by two or more adopters, and who after 3 days has not removed the Adoptme template.</li>
</ol>
<p>With both of these suggestions the user concerned will be told why the Adoptme Template has been removed, and that they are welcome to reinstate it. Unless anybody has any major objections to this, I will enact it a day or two.

<p>Hello. This is Flameviper, saying that I'm back to my happy home here at Wikipedia. I had to leave here for a month or so, for reasons I will not discuss right now.</p>
<p>And for other reasons that I will also not discuss right now, I have realized that Wikipedia is the place for the Flamey Snake. So, without further ado, I'll discuss the current state of things.</p>
<p>As far as Adopt-a-User, I want to say that I am very proud of its current progress and that Lethaniol seems to be doing a great job at managing the ever-growing program. I must say that at first, I had some doubt at whether somebody else would be able to do the same thing I did, but after periodically checking in to see what Lethaniol has done, I am assured that Adopt-a-User is in safe hands.</p>
<p>Although Lethaniol is doing a great job currently, I don't think that one person will be eventually able to control the huge program. And so if you need any help with things, just call on me. I'll be there in a flash.</p>

<h2><span class="plainlinks"><span class="mw-headline">Lots of People wanting to be Adopted!</span></span></h2>
<p>It is becoming obvious that as the Adopt-a-user program becomes more and more popular, the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedians_seeking_to_be_adopted_in_Adopt-a-user_d05c.html" title="Category:Wikipedians seeking to be adopted in Adopt-a-user">Category:Wikipedians seeking to be adopted in Adopt-a-user</a> is becoming a bit cumbersome. This is because it is harder for newer Adopters to find people that they want to offer adoption to, and that some user seeking Adoption are currently not offered it. The solution mentioned <a href="../../../a/b/o/Above.html" title="Above">above</a> to remove the <a href="../../../a/d/o/Template%7EAdoptme_a6f6.html" title="Template:Adoptme">Template:Adoptme</a> from users that have been offered multiple adoptions or been inactive since adoption offer – has worked to some extent cutting the numbers to about 2/3, but that still leaves 30 odd users seeking adoption and that number is only going to get bigger.</p>
<p>One of the reason for increasing demand has been the <a href="../../../w/e/l/Template%7EWelcome123_604a.html" title="Template:Welcome123">Template:Welcome123</a> which has advertised the program extremely well. I made an alteration recently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3AWelcome123&amp;diff=98646555&amp;oldid=97921248" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3AWelcome123&amp;diff=98646555&amp;oldid=97921248" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> that removes the instructions on how to add <i>Adoptme</i> to a user page, and instead guides people to the <a href="../../../a/d/o/WP%7EADOPT_c4e7.html" title="WP:ADOPT">WP:ADOPT</a> page. This means new users will have to read up about Adoption, giving them more buy in, before learning how to be Adopted.</p>
<p>Another change I have made is to the <a href="../../../a/d/o/Template%7EAdoptme_a6f6.html" title="Template:Adoptme">Template:Adoptme</a> itself, adding a link to <a href="../../../a/d/o/Wikipedia%7EAdopt-a-User_Adoptee%27s_Area_Adopters_f0cf.html" title="Wikipedia:Adopt-a-User/Adoptee's Area/Adopters">Wikipedia:Adopt-a-User/Adoptee's Area/Adopters</a> so that users can track down potential adopters themselves.</p>
<p><a name="New_Category_Proposal" id="New_Category_Proposal"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">New Category Proposal</span></h3>
<p>On top if this I have the following proposal:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Create new category for example – Category:Wikipedians seeking adoption with the Adopt-a-User that have already been offered adoption by one or more experienced users.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Create a new user box that Adopters replace the <i>Adoptme</i> user box with once they have offered Adoption to a user. This user box will obviously add that user to the category mentioned above.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Initially someone (likely me&#160;:( ) will have to go round and change these user boxes, but once people get into the swing the Adopters themselves can do this 10 second job. One of main advantages of this proposal is that it will still allow us to keep an eye on users that have been offered adoption but not adopted as yet, as well as leaving them a user box with links/info on how to request another adopter if they do not like the user who has offered adoption. The main disadvantage is the extra editing that each adopter has to do.</p>
<p>What do people think – yes or no? If no please come up with some other suggestions on how to improve the situation at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedians_seeking_to_be_adopted_in_Adopt-a-user_d05c.html" title="Category:Wikipedians seeking to be adopted in Adopt-a-user">Category:Wikipedians seeking to be adopted in Adopt-a-user</a>. Again if no reply in a few days I will enact upon this. Also I will get on creating the required user box and category in the meantime.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Some questions.</span></h2>
<p>How does adoption work? Do you keep an eye on them and offer advice when they make mistakes, or just wait until they come to you with questions, or what? How long does a typical adoption take? <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> (Have a nice day!) 11:42, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well here is my opinion - other opinions would be really welcomed. Generally I let the adoptee ask me questions, and keep out of their hair. If an adoptee does not ask many questions or has been silent for a while, I drop by their talk page give a friendly hello and maybe check out their contributions to see what they have been up to. Only if they are having obvious problems e.g. blocks, vandalism tags, conflict with another user, or minor things like not signing talk pages or using edit summaries will I seek to offer obvious advice.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In terms of the process of adoption the standard way seems to be to drop by the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedians_seeking_to_be_adopted_in_Adopt-a-user_d05c.html" title="Category:Wikipedians seeking to be adopted in Adopt-a-user">category for users seeking adoption</a>, asking up to a couple of these users if they want adoption (you will generally not get a 100% success rate when you offer adoption - but should be prepared for it if it happens), wait for them to confirm on your/their talk page, confirm adoption by updating <a href="../../../a/d/o/Wikipedia%7EAdopt-a-User_Adopter%27s_Area_Resources_2e75.html#Templates_including_modified_welcome_template" title="Wikipedia:Adopt-a-User/Adopter's Area/Resources">adoption templates</a>, and then ask them what they would like help with. The adoption then continues either until:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>The adoptee becomes suitably experienced to <i>graduate</i> from the program (for an average user probably between 1-3months).</li>
<li>The adoptee becomes inactive or does not respond to your offers of help.</li>
<li>The adoptee is unhappy with their adopter and wishes a new one or wishes to leave the program.</li>
<li>The adopter becomes unhappy with their adoptee - e.g. in the rare case that an adoptee is <i>using</i> there adopter to hide behind when they get into conflict.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>The length of adoption is interesting because I have found that I get lots of simple questions early on, and then as the adopotee becomes more comfortable with Wikipedia less questions, but when you do get them they tend to be of a more involved nature e.g. dealing with conflict, setting up templates, wikiprojects etc.. or reviewing their work.</dd>

<p>Hi everyone -</p>
<p>You may have noticed that I have been putting a lot of work into Adopt-a-user over the last two months - well now it is time for me to take a break and play around with other things in Wikipedia. I will stay as a very active Adopter and continue to Adopt new users, also I will continue with the following tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Complete and send a message to all Adoptees as mentioned <a href="../../../a/d/o/Wikipedia_talk%7EAdopt-a-User_aea5.html#Contacting_All_Adoptees_and_Adopters" title="Wikipedia talk:Adopt-a-User">above</a>.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Categorization and userboxes</span></h2>
<p>Hello. I just wanted to let the people who administrate and edit this great help forum know that I have just gone through all the pages (at least the ones I could find) and categorized the pages under <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_Adopt-a-User_9835.html" title="Category:Wikipedia Adopt-a-User">Cat:Wikipedia Adopt-a-User</a>. This way, it will be much easier to a) find all the forum's pages in one place, and b) update all pages using <a href="../../../a/w/b/WP%7EAWB_c695.html" title="WP:AWB">AWB</a> if something needs to be changed in the future.</p>
<p>I also tweaked the userboxes very slightly by adding <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillscrlt_UBX_categories_5524.html" title="User:Willscrlt/UBX/categories">category suppression</a> to them. This way the actual userboxes can be displayed on the <a href="../../../a/d/o/Wikipedia%7EAdopt-a-User_Templates_cfbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Adopt-a-User/Templates">templates page</a> instead of a substituted version. This gives a "live preview" of the actual userboxes, which also helps to detect if anyone has vandalized the boxes. I have also tried to track down the non-user pages where these userboxes have been displayed and suppressed the categories on those pages (since they aren't users, the pages don't need adoption).</p>
<p>If anyone has any questions about what I did or would like more details, feel free to ask. I think this is a great idea for a program, and I have recently adopted three Wikipedians. I thought it would be nice to give back to the program a bit, too.

<p>I think that those who have been blocked from editing in the past 6 months <i>because they have used a proxy such as Google Web Accelerator</i> should still be allowed to adopt.

<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>I see there is a growing backlog at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedians_seeking_to_be_adopted_in_Adopt-a-user_d05c.html" title="Category:Wikipedians seeking to be adopted in Adopt-a-user">Category:Wikipedians seeking to be adopted in Adopt-a-user</a>, any ideas on how to sort this, some suggestions to get the ball rolling:</p>
<ol>
<li>Recruit more Adopters</li>
<li>Encourage all Adopters to take on one or more new Adoptees</li>
</ol>
<p>Not sure if these ideas will work but certainly needs something done! Cheers <a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethaniol_eabe.html" title="User talk:Lethaniol">Lethaniol</a> 16:38, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes I think that would be fine but I suppose there is one proviso - IMHO you need to be editing on Wikipedia regularly i.e. every day or two so that you can respond to any questions that your adoptees might have.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Using AWB</span></h2>
<p>I see no problem with it, however, I just want to make sure it's okay to use AWB to change {{adopt me}} to {{adoptoffer}} on their user page. Is it? --<a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETeckWiz_cd20.html" title="User:TeckWiz"><b>TeckWiz</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../t/e/c/User_talk%7ETeckWiz_cb9b.html" title="User talk:TeckWiz">Parlate</a></sup><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TeckWiz_ea80.html" title="Special:Contributions/TeckWiz">Contribs</a><sub><a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETeckWiz_%40_bf84.html" title="User:TeckWiz/@">@</a></sub></small> 03:07, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't see anything wrong with it in principle, but wanting to use AWB implies you would be offering adoption to a plurality of users, and you should be careful not to offer adoption to too many users at once. I know you are a capable person, though, and I'm sure you have it well under control. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDar-Ape_ebe2.html" title="User:Dar-Ape">Dar</a>-<a href="../../../d/a/r/User_talk%7EDar-Ape_4b35.html" title="User talk:Dar-Ape">Ape</a> 03:41, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It doesn't seem like adopties are that active. I usually get only one question per day. I guess they're still getting into Wikipedia. So, I have plenty of space for people. --<a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETeckWiz_cd20.html" title="User:TeckWiz"><b>TeckWiz</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../t/e/c/User_talk%7ETeckWiz_cb9b.html" title="User talk:TeckWiz">Parlate</a></sup><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TeckWiz_ea80.html" title="Special:Contributions/TeckWiz">Contribs</a><sub><a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETeckWiz_%40_bf84.html" title="User:TeckWiz/@">@</a></sub></small> 03:59, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I do not see a problem with using AWB (though you should be using something like the piped link templates: {{Adoptoffer|Lethaniol}}. Obviously I too have quite a few adoptees, but I find that their question load is low. Hence when I offer adoption I normally do so to a handful of users (4-8), because although the initial workload will be high, it soon drops off.

These users, as in this case, show little or no interest in the project and seem unlikely to return, but fill up <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedians_seeking_to_be_adopted_in_Adopt-a-user_d05c.html" title="Category:Wikipedians seeking to be adopted in Adopt-a-user">Category:Wikipedians seeking to be adopted in Adopt-a-user</a> and make it more difficult to identify active users who need assistance.

<dd>I'd say after a week, certainly two, just remove the adoptme.

<dd>This was the main reason why I created <a href="../../../a/d/o/Template%7EAdoptoffer_6cfb.html" title="Template:Adoptoffer">Template:Adoptoffer</a> so that users with very few edits could be offered adoption, but not clog up <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedians_seeking_to_be_adopted_in_Adopt-a-user_d05c.html" title="Category:Wikipedians seeking to be adopted in Adopt-a-user">Category:Wikipedians seeking to be adopted in Adopt-a-user</a>.
