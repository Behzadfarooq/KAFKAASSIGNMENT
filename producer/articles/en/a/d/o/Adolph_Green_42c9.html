<p>Green was born in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">the Bronx</a> to <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hungary.html" title="Hungary">Hungarian</a>-<a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish.html" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> immigrants Daniel and Helen Weiss Green. After high school, he worked as a runner on <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wall_Street_9499.html" title="Wall Street">Wall Street</a> while he tried to make it as an actor. He met Comden through mutual friends in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a> while she was studying drama at <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_University_dca5.html" title="New York University">New York University</a>. They formed a troupe called the Revuers, which performed at the <a href="../../../v/i/l/Village_Vanguard_5017.html" title="Village Vanguard">Village Vanguard</a>, a club in <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greenwich_Village_91fa.html" title="Greenwich Village">Greenwich Village</a>. Among the members of the company was a young comedian named Judy Tuvin, who later changed her name to <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judy_Holliday_3636.html" title="Judy Holliday">Judy Holliday</a>, and Green's good friend, a young musician named <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonard_Bernstein_093b.html" title="Leonard Bernstein">Leonard Bernstein</a>, frequently accompanied them on the piano. The act's success earned them a movie offer and the Revuers traveled west in hopes of finding fame in <i>Greenwich Village</i>, a <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944_in_film.html" title="1944 in film">1944</a> movie starring <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carmen_Miranda_f0d9.html" title="Carmen Miranda">Carmen Miranda</a> and <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Ameche_c40e.html" title="Don Ameche">Don Ameche</a>, but their roles were so small they barely were noticed, and they quickly returned to New York.</p>
<p>Their first Broadway effort joined them with Bernstein for <i><a href="../../../o/n/_/On_the_Town_fd7f.html" title="On the Town">On the Town</a></i>, a musical romp about three sailors on leave in New York City that was an expansion of a <a href="../../../b/a/l/Ballet.html" title="Ballet">ballet</a> entitled <i>Fancy Free</i> on which Bernstein had been working with <a href="../../../c/h/o/Choreographer.html" title="Choreographer">choreographer</a> <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerome_Robbins_0e66.html" title="Jerome Robbins">Jerome Robbins</a>. Comden and Green wrote the lyrics and book, which included sizeable parts for themselves. Their next two musicals, <i>Billion Dollar Baby</i> (1945) and <i>Bonanza Bound</i> (1947) were not successful, and once again they headed to California, where they immediately found work atet MGM.</p>
<p>They wrote the screenplay for <i><a href="../../../g/o/o/Good_News_269e.html" title="Good News">Good News</a></i>, starring <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_Allyson_c4f8.html" title="June Allyson">June Allyson</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Lawford_c2d1.html" title="Peter Lawford">Peter Lawford</a>, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Barkleys_of_Broadway_0c05.html" title="The Barkleys of Broadway">The Barkleys of Broadway</a></i> for <a href="../../../g/i/n/Ginger_Rogers_7a3f.html" title="Ginger Rogers">Ginger Rogers</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Astaire_084a.html" title="Fred Astaire">Fred Astaire</a>, and then adapted <i>On the Town</i> for <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Sinatra_d0f7.html" title="Frank Sinatra">Frank Sinatra</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene_Kelly_33e8.html" title="Gene Kelly">Gene Kelly</a>, scrapping Bernstein's music at the request of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Freed_01cd.html" title="Arthur Freed">Arthur Freed</a>, who did not care for the Bernstein score.</p>

<p>They reunited with Kelly for their most successful project, the classic <i><a href="../../../s/i/n/Singin%27_in_the_Rain_%28film%29_9191.html" title="Singin' in the Rain (film)">Singin' in the Rain</a></i>, about Hollywood in the final days of the silent film era. Considered by many film historians to be the best movie musical of all time, it ranked #10 on the list of the 100 Best American Movies of the 20th Century, compiled by the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Film_Institute_e524.html" title="American Film Institute">American Film Institute</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>. They followed this with another hit, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Band_Wagon_057a.html" title="The Band Wagon">The Band Wagon</a></i>, in which the characters of Lester and Lily, a husband-and-wife team that writes the screenplay for the show-within-a-show, were patterned after themselves. They were <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_Award_136f.html" title="Academy Award">Oscar</a>-nominated twice, for their screenplays for <i>The Band Wagon</i> and <i><a href="../../../i/t/27/It%27s_Always_Fair_Weather_7e27.html" title="It's Always Fair Weather">It's Always Fair Weather</a></i>, both of which earned them a <a href="../../../w/r/i/Writers_Guild_of_America_faab.html" title="Writers Guild of America">Screen Writers Guild Award</a>, as did <i>On the Town</i>.</p>
<p>Their stage work during the next few years included the revue <i><a href="../../../t/w/o/Two_on_the_Aisle_b67c.html" title="Two on the Aisle">Two on the Aisle</a></i>, starring <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bert_Lahr_5cdf.html" title="Bert Lahr">Bert Lahr</a> and <a href="../../../d/o/l/Dolores_Gray_b5e8.html" title="Dolores Gray">Dolores Gray</a>, <i><a href="../../../w/o/n/Wonderful_Town_06d8.html" title="Wonderful Town">Wonderful Town</a></i>, an adaptation of the comedy hit <i><a href="../../../m/y/_/My_Sister_Eileen_8c9f.html" title="My Sister Eileen">My Sister Eileen</a></i>, with <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosalind_Russell_7997.html" title="Rosalind Russell">Rosalind Russell</a> and <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edie_Adams_b904.html" title="Edie Adams">Edie Adams</a> as two sisters from Ohio trying to make it in the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Apple_edd6.html" title="Big Apple">Big Apple</a>, and <i><a href="../../../b/e/l/Bells_Are_Ringing_%28musical%29_4cbd.html" title="Bells Are Ringing (musical)">Bells Are Ringing</a></i>, which reunited them with Judy Holliday as an operator at a telephone answering service. The score, including the standards "Just in Time," "Long Before I Knew You," and "The Party’s Over," proved to be one of their richest.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1958.html" title="1958">1958</a>, they appeared on Broadway in <i>A Party with Betty Comden and Adolph Green</i>, a revue that included some of their early sketches. It was a critical and commercial success, and they brought an updated version back to Broadway in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a>.</p>
<p>Among their other credits are the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Martin_ffc6.html" title="Mary Martin">Mary Martin</a> version of <i><a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Pan_7c41.html" title="Peter Pan">Peter Pan</a></i> for both Broadway and television, a streamlined <i><a href="../../../d/i/e/Die_Fledermaus_addb.html" title="Die Fledermaus">Die Fledermaus</a></i> for the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolitan_Opera_386b.html" title="Metropolitan Opera">Metropolitan Opera</a>, and stage musicals for <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carol_Burnett_bffe.html" title="Carol Burnett">Carol Burnett</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/s/Leslie_Uggams_9a60.html" title="Leslie Uggams">Leslie Uggams</a>, and <a href="../../../l/a/u/Lauren_Bacall_c938.html" title="Lauren Bacall">Lauren Bacall</a>, among others.

<p>The team was not without its failures. In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>, <i><a href="../../../a/_/d/A_Doll%27s_Life_6a71.html" title="A Doll's Life">A Doll's Life</a></i>, a misguided attempt to figure out what Nora did after she abandoned her husband in <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henrik_Ibsen_812c.html" title="Henrik Ibsen">Henrik Ibsen</a>'s <i><a href="../../../a/_/d/A_Doll%27s_House_18c2.html" title="A Doll's House">A Doll's House</a></i>, ran for only five performances, although they received <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Award_ddaa.html" title="Tony Award">Tony Award</a> nominations for its book and score.</p>

<p>SIMILARITIES BETWEEN "SINGIN' IN THE RAIN" AND KAUFMAN AND HART'S "ONCE IN A LIFETIME"</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the creative brilliance of "Singin' in the Rain," it should be noted, as has been pointed out by various theater and film historians, that the very subject matter and satiric view of Hollywood as it transitioned from silent to talking pictures was preceded (and some have argued) based on the George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart play, "Once in a Lifetime." That play was produced on Broadway in 1930, roughly fifteen years before "Singin'" and features the same character types as well as many similar plot devices seen in "Singin' in the Rain." Some of the similarities are very close indeeed: the inept sound recording technicians, the untalented film star whose inability to perform in a sound movie must be disguised and the generally dim view of Hollywood's ability to adapt to the new technology, were first presented by Kaufman and Hart in their earlier Broadway hit. It should also be noted that while Comden and Green were stellar lyricists, all the slongs featured in "Singin' in the Rain" had been written much earlier, many as early as the 1920s. Music and lyrics for the song "Singin' in the Rain" itself were by Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown; "Make 'em Laugh," considered an original song, was a near-plagiarism of a Cole Porter song (see relevant Wikipedia entry); "Good Morning" had been featured in the earlier film, "Babes in Toyland," and so on. While Comden and Green's achievement on "Singin' in the Rain" was considerable, the creators of much of the raw creative ideas and material (some of far lesser renown67.163.22.112 21:30, 9 February 2007 (UTC)) deserve proper credit and our true appreciation.</p>
