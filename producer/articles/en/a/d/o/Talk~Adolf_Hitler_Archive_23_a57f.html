<h2><span class="mw-headline">Charisma</span></h2>
<p>This was indeed discussed some time ago. Calling this sociopath charismatic is not a compliment so there's no reason to qualify it with distracting "weasel" language. Lots of unhelpful, murderous people, including genocidal sociopaths like AH, have charisma. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 08:14, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know why I have to repeat myself a few hundred times. It is not like I'm talking to illiterates. Please read what has been written, repeated and emphasize in the sections above - charisma is not being debated, its role is. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 00:29, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Brute force</span></h2>
<p>Please provide citations from major biographers and other historians published in verifiable secondary sources to support the use of the vague op-ed term <i>brute force</i> in the header of this article, thank you. I see no reason why AH's police-state methods can't be referred to as what they were, the use of para-military and police power. I guess I should add, since AH is so (justifiably) hated, that my concern here is the use of encyclopedic and helpfully descriptive language. Speaking among friends, I'm sure I've characterised Mr Hitler's political machine or tactics as "brutal" but the term is too vague for an academically sound description. I mean, I've also called him <i>a psychotic, murderous asshole who set back civilisation at least a generation</i> but wouldn't support that language here. Moreover, for the first several years lots of Germans didn't find him brutal at all. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 15:36, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Brute force may be op-ed language, but it is not untruthful; if you want references and scholarly material, look up the acclaimed "Nazi Germany and the Jews" by Saul Friedlander. Here's a quote from the early pages in my copy: "Anti-Jewish violence spread (my note: SPREAD, not BEGUN) after the March elections... In Breslau, Jewish lawyers and judges were assaulted in the court building... in Gedern, the SA (Storm Troopers) broke into Jewish homes and beat up the inhabitants... The list of similar incidents is a long one. There were also killings... (etc.)... Much of the foreign press gave wide coverage to the Nazi violence." Also note, on the previous page: "The primary political targets of the new regime and of its terror system, at least during the first months after the Nazi accession to power, were not Jews but Communists." Also look at the works "Holocaust: A History" by Deborak Dwork and Robert Jan van Pelt, "Holocaust" by Martin Gilbert. Jews were being publicly humiliated in the streets by police, arrested, their homes were broken into and wrecked, and groups of Jews started being transported to concentration camps almost right away. All the scholars mentioned are reputable, not hacks like Goldhagen or other agenda-driven ultra-Zionists.</dd>

It's true, the latter may be unhelpful. However, it usually comes AFTER I meet with IMMENSELY unhelpful resistance to making small but necessary changes.

<dd>Wyss, I'm serious, there is really nothing I can find at the link which explains what the phrase "keen political skills" means.

<dd>Interestingly enough, all of the sites you linked support the fact that anti-Semitism was a major factor in Hitler's popularity, and that violence was frequently used by Hitler, both of which you tried to play down with your edits. As for his political skills, they don't seem to point to much that is specific other than what is mentioned, namely his ultra-nationalism, rhetorical skills, anti-Semitism, economic promises, use of propaganda etc. and they also discuss his crackpot theories and personality which don't qualify as "skills", apart from other factors that have little to do with Hitler; the salient exceptions are Hitler's choice of symbol for the Nazis, which is of course good marketing, and the rivalries he allowed to develop to strengthen his own position. I was wrong to miss these, but I think you'll agree you made it unfeasible by simply throwing up a search with mostly redundant material. However, they don't seem to add up to a whole new set of skills after mentioning "use of propaganda" or "charismatic oratory". Perhaps we could keep "political skills" and remove the adjective "keen." -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 02:13, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Why "violent" is not redundant &amp; op-ed langauge</span></h2>
<p>At least three users don't seem to understand the diff between saying police powers were involved and violent police power was involved. It's very simple, it helps if you know a little history:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stalinist Russia was a police state in which millions were deported, tortured, executed without fair trial, etc. Police and para-military forces were involved, of course. However, unlike Nazi Germany, these forces did not beat up people on the streets, in their homes, in full view of others, and so on. The Post-Stalinist era did not see great changes in method; of course, the arbitrariness, censorship and death toll decreased drastically, but the Soviet Union remained a very strict police state.</li>
<li>East Germany, practically micro-managed by the Stasi, was a police state which used similar methods, again with lower numbers of victims and with less visibility, but with equally dangerous consequences for anyone implicated in any "subversive" activity. The same extends to other Soviet "satellite states" like Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, etc.</li>
<li>North Korea, and certain Latin American, Middle Eastern and African countries are among modern police states with the grimmest human rights records. Once again, military and police forces are always under the government in these countries, but they do not all engage in public violence against citizens.</li>
</ol>
<p>As shown above, all of the Nazi violence was of a different order and the words chosen are perhaps better than "brute force".</p>
<p>However, other op-ed language has crept into the header which in my opinion is not substantial enough and therefore does not belong. This includes "keen political skills", which has been debated above and which I will repeat stands for very little more than the specific propaganda and oratory skills already mentioned; and now the newly introduced "schadenfreude".</p>
<p>This is a header and not really a summary. I think violence and anti-Semitism belong in the header because they were significant aspects of Hitler/Hitlerianism which affected thousands if not millions. I wouldn't say that vague language like 'political skills' or that documented but not all that relevant 'schadenfreude' affected thousands if not millions. However, I'm open to suggestions about the latter.</p>
<p>Finally, NPOV is not about giving equal time to every single opinion and making every personality look like a mix of good and bad. It's about using unbiased information to project a contextually accurate picture. Trying to throw in information about, for ex., how much Hitler loved little furry animals to "balance" an article is no longer about NPOV, it's about being un/able to judge the value of facts. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 04:53, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree that North Korea, Guatemala, and Zimbabwe are "not violent." We simply don't have to spell out every single method in the <i>intro</i>; that's what the <i>article</i> is for.

<dd>Zimbabwe, from time to time yes. I don't know enough about Guatemala; North Korea - the streets are practically deserted a lot of the time. Please look at what I'm saying - secret/ military police are violent, but not always publicly, and that's what I want to emphasize. It's not about "spelling out methods". Are you deliberately being trivialising? Do you think the difference between public violence and humiliation and secret torture is just a question of method? In the Soviet Union it was possibly to deny torture and it is true that even now many people don't know/ don't believe in Stalinist crimes, in Russia. In Nazi Germany the crowds cheered on. Talking about his violent methods is specific. Mentioning "keen political skills" is judgement. I find your judgement on the header rather skewed, not for any partisan reasons, but probably simply because you don't want any changes. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 10:46, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Violence and Request for comment</span></h2>
<p>I came in through <a href="../../../r/e/q/WP%7ERequests_for_comment_Politics_16db.html" title="WP:Requests for comment/Politics">WP:Requests for comment/Politics</a>, on whether or not "violence" and "anti-semitism" are suitable terms for the into.</p>
<p>I've read it over a few times, and feel it to be quite balanced at the moment (dont know whose reversion it is, and dont want to know!). There are some issues with the phrasing imho, for example the mild suggestion that violence was a tool he used to come to power, which was not really the case. Some intimidation, certainly, but the true paramilitary and police violence came later.</p>
<p>Also, as a mild grammar issue, the sentence "Hitler gained popularity through his appeals to German nationalism, his anti-Semitism, his charismatic oratory, schadenfreude and promises of economic improvement" suggests that he made appeals to his charismatic oratory , which is kind of odd.

<dd>Hi there, I think the open violence should be mentioned along with anti-Semitism, and I think we tried to point out that he used the violence to gain totalitarian control, not popularity! Your rephrasing is fine except for a nit in the second line - power is mentioned a second time too soon, sounds jarring.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Encyclopedic Standards and mealy-mouting</span></h2>
<p>Here is an excerpt from a professional peer-reviwed encylopedia, "The Encylopedia Americana". The entry is called "Adolf Hitler" and it is attributed to one Wolfgan Sauer of the University of California, Berkely. The intro says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"...Riding on a wave of European fascism after WWI...he built a Fascist regime <b>unparalleled for barbarism and terror</b>. <b>His rule</b> resulted in the destruction of the German nation-state and its society, in the ruin of much of Europe's traditional structure, and in the extremination of about 6 million Jews. He was eeventually defeated, but his temporay success demontsrated frightenongly, at the brink of the atomic age, the vulnerability of civiliztion."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Point 1) You see, THAT's a lead. It does exactly what it is supposed to do: it summarizes Adolf Hitler and the results of his actions, what they mean for humnaity. The rest of the articel is suposed to flesh out the details. The lead of an article should not be about this or that speficic aspect of the subject's life in the first place: he obtained power by thais or that means. That's what the body of the artcile is for: early years, Hitler's childhood, Hitler's rise, etc,..</p>
<p>Point 2) The langauge is obviously quite straightforward and blunt. Not POV, just blunt and honest. It is a fact that Hitler built a Fascist regime unparalled in brutality, barabraims and terror. To elimeinate such terms is to present a false and dangerously misleasing picture of what happened during those years. The article should just tell the truth. But if we must onsist on the doumcnation of every single word, then deos anyone mind if I throw in "unparalled barbarim and terror" since it is used by a historian in a peer-revied professional encylcopedia. --<a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacatosias_a9d0.html" title="User:Lacatosias">Lacatosias</a> 10:43, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agreed, 100%. Op-ed reassurances that he was a murderous asshole will hurt the article's credibility for many serious readers, who are looking for facts and already know how bad he was. The question, which the body of this article helpfully does address, is <i>how</i> someone so dangerous could ever have become so powerful. Simply put, lots of people thought he was saving the world in Germany's image. Few educated Germans, even the hardened-from-birth anti-semites, would have supported him in 1933 had they known the industrial slaughter camps would result (never mind the rest). <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 18:04, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Most of his biographers attribute AH with highly developed political skills, especially by the early 1930s. He didn't wrest control of all Western Europe by 1940 through dint of oratory alone.

<p>Hallo, I know I started this but by now the opening paragraph has become "overcrowded" with attributes, some of them not that fitting (e.g. Schadenfreude). If we cannot do add a simple reference to a few of Hitler's attributes I must suggest moving this further down, say to the section on his early rise. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 16:22, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think moving it down might not be a bad idea. Along the lines of what I wrote above (somewhere), the lead should be a summary not explain the rise of Hitler, all of the attributes of Hitler ot anything like that in any case. Just a suggestion but it is actually a kind of informal policy, I undertsand, in encypedia artciles.--<a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacatosias_a9d0.html" title="User:Lacatosias">Lacatosias</a> 18:09, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem is "spin." Lots of people like to portray AH as a cartoon character of evil, thinking that giving him credit for any talent or skills is to endorse what he did with them. He wasn't a cartoon character of evil, but something much more sophisticated and dangerous. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 17:53, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

And Wyss, about "keen political skills", let's quote your own words - <i>If it's so generally held, finding a suitable citation in a secondary source by a peer-reviewed author shouldn't be much trouble.</i> (ie not just a handful of web pages.) As with charisma, it's not the inclusion that's being debated so much as its relevance next to other factors that are <i>already mentioned</i> and provide <i>more specific information.</i> -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 23:07, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">RfC</span></h2>
<p>I suggest replacing disputed adjectives with facts. I speak German also and I share the doubts about using "schadenfreude" in the introduction. That word describes a passive sort of mean-spiritedness. "Charismatic" is less informative than to note that he came to power at the lowest point of the Depression.</p>
<p>Hitler's early economic program included halting reparations payments to World War I victors and increasing German defense spending. These measures improved the German economy and were popular domestically although they violated international treaty. A central part of Hitler's beliefs was that the problems of Germany were caused by Jewish people. He put this into practice soon after he gained office by firing all persons of Jewish descent from civil service jobs and replacing them with non-Jewish Germans. Increasingly severe restrictions followed over the next decade, removing Jewish people from all aspects of economic and civic life, and culminating in the Holocaust (follow with figures already in the article). More than any other individual, Adolf Hitler was responsible for causing World War II. (As the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> introduction states), "Approximately 62 million people died as a result of the war."</p>
<p>These are statements that no serious scholar can dispute and that illustrate why another encyclopedia characterized his rule as "unparalleled barbarism." Such expressions are not hyperbole in the case of Adolf Hitler, but it is better to show the dispassionate facts behind them. As each new generation approaches maturity it encounters this history afresh.

<dd>I would just leave the question of charisma alone. It's been beaten to death already and I don't understand why you still have to oppose it so vehemently. As someone who has lived there and was to some extent part of the collective contemplation of <i>how this happen</i> it is fairly clear that he was someone who has brought his particular skills to bear at the right time and exploited a certain opportunity, which might not have existed in this exact form before or after. Charistmatic authority (for the lack of more fitting expression) was one of them. It's certainly much more valid than <i>schadendfreude</i>, which has finally been removed. <a href="../../../j/b/e/User%7EJbetak_984b.html" title="User:Jbetak">Jbetak</a> 23:08, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, yes, there was a combination of circumstances and catalysts, and all I wish to emphasize is that certain articulations of the intro <i>strongly imply</i> that Hitler's charisma was a primary factor or the basis on which all the other factors came into play, where Hitler's/Nazism's popularity is concerned. The intro needs to be balanced, that's all.

<p>Regarding <i>charisma</i>: this word tends to glamorize people. I'd prefer "effective" or "skilled" to describe Hitler's public speaking. That was one of many elements that led to his power. However, that particular element is hard to quantify. His domestic popularity is an interesting subject. It would be better to discuss that in context later in the article. I suggest that the introduction focus on elements that lend themselves to simple and uncontroversial summaries. The role the great depression played in the Nazi rise to power is one such element. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 06:08, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
