<h2><span class="mw-headline">Night of the long knives</span></h2>
<p>This extract is suspicious too: " To consolidate his regime, Hitler needed the neutrality of the Army and the industrial magnates. They were alarmed by the "socialist" component of National Socialism, which was represented by the mainly working-class Brownshirts of Ernst Röhm's SA. To remove this barrier to acceptance of his regime, Hitler unleashed his lieutenant Himmler to murder Röhm and dozens of other real and potential enemies during the night of June 29-June 30, 1934. The event is remembered as the Night of the Long Knives. "</p>
<p>Was the Night of the Long Knives a result from considerations about industrial magnates&#160;? Himmler planned the whole thing didn't he&#160;? What does Himmler care about the industrial magnate's views&#160;?</p>
<p>He was interested in winning the power struggle inside the regime, that's what I think.</p>
<p>Is this again a sentence from one of the "Glasnost" readers, or does anyone have material to support it&#160;? Otherwise we should cut it. --217.228.213.50 10:26, 14 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>A cursory read of any history of the SS (Reitlingers "Alibi of a nation" is highly recomended) will show that the Night of the Long Knives had little if anything in reality to do with any considerations about insustrial leaders as such - there were concerns about Political Issues and Rhoem's relationship with them but the act was nothing more than Himmler doing Hitlers bidding and clearing potentially embarassing people from the scene. The only reason that industrial magnates would have been a consideration is in terms of breaking their power and removing any threat to the leadership of the Party and the Reich.</p>
<p>It is well worth reading about the events of that Night as they give an interesting insight into the character of both Himmler and Hitler but also others who would go on to become powerful figures within the Nazi party and the government/miltary apparatus.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hitler and vegetarianism</span></h2>
<p>I removed a sentence describing Hitler becoming a vegetarian. AFAIK this is an urban myth, just try googling with <i>hitler vegetarian</i> and see most results. --<a href="../../../f/a/r/User%7EFarside_3ab6.html" title="User:Farside">Farside</a> 17:05, 15 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This needs to be pinned down. See List of vegetarians and Talk:List of vegetarians. I was under the impression that it was an urban myth and I found <a href="http://www.vegsource.com/berry/hitler.html" class="external free" title="http://www.vegsource.com/berry/hitler.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.vegsource.com/berry/hitler.html</a> to support this assertion, however the List of vegetarians article has now been changed to read "according to several sources who had close personal contact with him, including the architect Albert Speer, his personal secretary Traudl Junge, and both of his cooks, Constanze Manziarly and Marlene von Exner. All of the respected biographies of Hitler, including those by Joachim Fest and Ian Kershaw, state that Hitler became a steadfast vegetarian after the death of his niece Geli Raubal in 1931. There is an urban legend that he occasionally engaged in the consumption of pork, but no member of his personal circle has confirmed this." <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMintguy_20fd.html" title="User talk:Mintguy">(T)</a> 17:14, 15 Jul 2004 (UTC)

<p>I read the U.S. Govt. report on him which stated that he stopped eating meat after the death of his neice, saying it reminded him of a corpse.

<dd>I suggest this, but I'll take my time on putting it on for obvious reasons. 1) I think it was a bit of a long paragraph, 2) I think "enforced" is a bit of a stretch, since he hasn't been shown to have personally carried anything out, and 3) I think the Red army needs mention (and credit) for being where they were, when they were. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam</a> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow"><b>Spade</b></a>] 01:58, 11 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Agreed, but it covers a lot of necessary material.</li>
<li>I am too tired to argue this point right now, but essentially, nothing happened in Nazi Germany without Hitler's approval. He imposed the anti-Semitic measures (Nuremberg, etc., that led to the Holocaust. There is documentation that he knew.</li>

<dd>I'd be very interested in documentation that he knew about the particulars of the holocaust.

I always assumed that due to <a href="../../../f/%C3%BC/h/F%C3%BChrerprinzip.html" title="Führerprinzip">Führerprinzip</a>, the higher ups expected independance and results from their subordinates, and saw question asking, or a need for micromanagement from below as a sign of gross incompentance.

<p>Hello, I think the article has a lot of problems currently. It seems more like a desperate search for positive wording than a serious encyclopedia article. Too frequently it seems like praise. You can verify what I wrote on the german wikipedia AH article btw. I don't want to make anymore edits since they'll likely be just reverted again. Just to exemplify, the very first sentence gets the facts very wrong. You'd have to say like he was leader of the party and 'leader and empire chancellor' from 1934 on. Führer means 'leader' in exactly the way native english speakers use the word, naively. Sentences like "he also spent a lot of time reading" or "reading the book is like hearing him speak" are utter crap. The article doesn't mention the guy didn't have any kind of school diploma and gets his failed artistic ambitions very wrong.</p>

<p>I have no problem with a mention of the Red Army (please capitalise), the reference in regards to reporting Hitler's suicide was just inaccurate. SMERSH wasn't part of the Red Army but of the NKVD, their job was to follow in the rear after the Red Army and mop up spies and saboteurs as well as basically police both the Red Army and the rest of the NKVD.

<p>Jiminey christmas, Hitler didn't kill all those people who died in WWII... I'm not even sure if he killed anybody, ever, and if he did it was in WWI, when he won the Iron Cross. If your going to blame world leaders for the death they lead to, how about the death toll for Marx? Or Jesus? Or muhammed? Anyways Stalin was <i>way</i> worse a person than Hitler, at least Hitler liked <i>somebody</i>, at least in theory, (his Aryan ideal Germans), unlike Stalin who never did a good thing for anybody ever, and tormented his own family and associates mercilessly, while having his native russian and georgian people massacred (as well as anti-jewish pograms). <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam</a> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow"><b>Spade</b></a>] 12:50, 16 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Jesus was wasn't a world leader, Marx wasn't idea, Muhammed was a secular leader. That why I feel insecure with Islam despite my respect for many Muslims. Idea will becoome what people do with.... But it's still difficult to me see where was the justification for the wars of religion in Europe in any Godspell... Seriously political leader in charge of some secular power aren't responsible&#160;? Georges Bush didn't wan't the second Gulf War&#160;? (good or bad isn't even the question), I think he did'nt kill any Iraquian or American soldier with his own hands.</p>
<p>At second though how regressive your idea is "at least Hitler killed somebody" it's simply tribal. You mean that it's more legitimate to kill on an ethnic basis&#160;? Stalin achieved to manipulate a lot of people for a criminal project because they believed they were working the happyness whole humanity. Hitler did this for the superiority of German race... Basic animal instinct of domination IMO.</p>
<p>Just for your information I've read Alexander Soljenitsyne in the first French edition when the French Socialist party was mostly ignoring his books. I never had any doubt it was the truth. But "Hitler is unpopular" is so weak it isn't serious. Hilter is considered has an terrific criminal by anyone who has some brain&#160;! <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Pierre_Raffarin_31b4.html" title="Jean Pierre Raffarin">Jean Pierre Raffarin</a> is unpopular....</p>

<dd>I don't necessarilly agree w your suggestion that a leader can be a criminal, and the subject of Pinochet comes to mind. I also question your evaluation of my point regarding Hitlers motivation. I am not saying it's ok to kill on an ethnic basis, but I am saying that is a more moral foundation to base ones abuses on than sheer ego and and intent to horrify. Hitler didn't want ordinary Germans terrified and cowering before his awfulness, but Stalin did want that from russians. Hitler wanted ethnic Germans to thrive at the expense of others, Stalin wanted himself to thrive, at the expense of his own Russian people. I see a moral distinction, but can accept that yoiu do not. Irregardless, I think the article articulates his unpopularity reasonably well in saying "<i>His legacy is to have become among the most reviled men in world history.</i>"</dd>

<dd>Not unless somebody disputes it we don't. As far as blaming the embrace of total war on all sides resulting in denying Hitler responsibility for <i>all</i> the death and destruction of WWII, your darn right. Hitler was <i>not</i> single handedly responsible for every bad thing that went down during that war. The allied powers did plenty of bad stuff too, not to mention the Japanese. Even the glorious Americans did some shady things (bombing of dresden, anyone? Japanese internment camps? etc..). Nobody in this discussion is trying to say Hitler was a benevolant, easy going chap w an undeserved reputation. Quite the opposite, I for one was trying to force some perspective. Anyhow, I think "one of the most reviled men in history" is perfectly accurate <i>and</i> NPOV, since its an obvious fact, and in no way attempts to sway the reader that this is a fair or accurate sentiment, but rather only that it is a common one, and something important to know when learning the basics about the man who was Adolf. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam</a> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow"><b>Spade</b></a>] 11:41, 20 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

Isn't funny how they have the death count at Auschwitz, yet every year it is reduced because we find out one person who was "dead" wasn't really dead, was at Auschwitz, or even existed. Yet the number stays at 6 million. And another thing to add, ever notice how ever Jew is a holocaust survivor?

For info, the interesting info on Alois Hitler taking the Hitler name is already in <a href="../../../a/l/o/Alois_Hitler_2be7.html" title="Alois Hitler">Alois Hitler</a> and further details on Klara Hitler are already in <a href="../../../k/l/a/Klara_Hitler_743f.html" title="Klara Hitler">Klara Hitler</a>.</p>
<p>After pruning, the next bit will be to consider whether it needs any restructuring/rewriting. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJongarrettuk_f336.html" title="User:Jongarrettuk">Jongarrettuk</a> 11:54, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If we make it featured, we will need to consider vandalism, which will only increase in that step. Perhaps locking it down during that time period? -<a href="../../../n/3/2/User%7EN328KF_2ea6.html" title="User:N328KF">Joseph</a> <a href="../../../n/3/2/User_talk%7EN328KF_4c65.html" title="User talk:N328KF">(Talk)</a> 14:14, 2004 Oct 2 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I've now finished my pruning and reordering. It's now the right size. So a note for <b>future editors:</b> <b>Only add something if you also take something away</b> (either deleting it or moving to a new page). Otherwise it will get longer than 32kb again.</p>
<p>I have created a number of new pages where some of the deleted info has gone. Many of these need tidying up! Please help. These articles are: <a href="../../../m/e/m/Members_of_Hitler%27s_cabinet_b89c.html" title="Members of Hitler's cabinet">Members of Hitler's cabinet</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler_in_popular_culture.html" title="Hitler in popular culture">Hitler in popular culture</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler%E2%80%99s_political_beliefs.html" title="Hitler’s political beliefs">Hitler’s political beliefs</a> and Images of Hitler. Other info was either input or already duplicated into existing articles, or of such peripheral interest (if it could be said to be of any interest) that I deleted it.</p>
<p>The article is now all in British English. Previously it was about half US and half UK. I had to get rid of this inconsisency, and on the grounds that Hitler was European, and on the grounds that as I'm British, British English comes more naturally to me, that's the form of English I've gone for. <b>Future editors: Please stick to using British English so that the article is consistent</b>.</p>
<p>Finally, if I've made a mistake and deleted your favourite bit or nugget of information, I apologise. Feel free to reinsert it (as long as you also delete sentences of a similar length to those you add). <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJongarrettuk_f336.html" title="User:Jongarrettuk">Jongarrettuk</a> 17:59, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hitler disambiguation</span></h2>
<p>Someone recently made <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler.html" title="Hitler">Hitler</a> a disambiguation page. I thought it silly so I changed it back to a redirect, but moved the other bit to <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Hitler (disambiguation)">Hitler (disambiguation)</a>, which is now an orphan (except for the above link). Should anything be done with that disambig page? All the names on it (except for <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Lu_Hitler_Marak_9014.html" title="Adolf Lu Hitler Marak">Adolf Lu Hitler Marak</a>, which probably doesn't belong anyway) are at the bottom of this article under Family.

<p>1st, I have no clue how the page got blanked, I think it was a wiki bug, cuz I didn't do that, afaik. second, eastern opinion on Hitler and Nazi's is very different, and some historians (you can call them apologists if you want) have a more favorable opinion. Not everybody in the world has the same opinion about everything.

<p>Saying Hitler's policies were "expansionist" is factually misleading, historical revisionism and shows ignorance of history. The fact of that matter is that most of the territories were actually formerly part of Germany before WWI and heavily populated by Germans but were clearly stolen from Germany. Trying to recover stolen lands is not "expansionist". User:Nayra:Nayra</p>

<dd>Sorry, I completely disagree. Whta you're saying is a half-truth at best, and grossly misleading at worst. If you seriously think your story is the whole truth, you should read some more history books (hint: start with looking up <a href="../../../l/e/b/Lebensraum.html" title="Lebensraum">Lebensraum</a> and think about why WW2 started with an invasion of Poland) -- <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFerkelparade_da80.html" title="User:Ferkelparade">Ferkelparade</a> <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFerkelparade_2c87.html" title="User talk:Ferkelparade">π</a> 06:48, 14 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree, it's irrelevant. Go to any other page about a person and it will have the person's date of birth, but not a reference to whether it was daylight when they were born. It just seems silly and unencyclopaedic. Also, it's long enough an article anyway, this is hardly a big issue that makes it worth saying in a short (32kb) article. That's why it gets removed, anyway. You'll have to ask those who add it why they keep adding it.<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJongarrettuk_f336.html" title="User:Jongarrettuk">jguk</a> 04:27, 16 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In addition to being irrelevant and non-encyclopedic, it's also vague, as it could mean just about any daylight hour, and I'm not even sure it's accurate. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 06:19, 17 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>
