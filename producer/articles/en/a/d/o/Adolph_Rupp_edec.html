<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolph_Rupp_edec.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Rupp was born outside <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halstead%2C_Kansas_8217.html" title="Halstead, Kansas">Halstead</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas.html" title="Kansas">Kansas</a> to <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mennonite.html" title="Mennonite">Mennonite</a> <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_people.html" title="German people">German</a> immigrants, the fourth of six children. He grew up on a 163-acre farm which his father (Heinrich) homesteaded. After his father's death in 1910, Rupp's oldest brother Otto took over farming responsibilities. As a youngster, Rupp worked on the farm and attended a school in a one-room school house in the country. He first became interested in the sport of basketball at the age of six years old when Halstead won the first of two consecutive Kansas state high school titles. According to interviews, he and his brothers stuffed rags into a gunnysack which his mother sewed up to use as a basketball on the family farm. Later, Rupp starred on his Halstead high school team, averaging 19 points per game his senior year while serving as captain and unofficial coach.</p>
<p>Rupp attended the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Kansas_7e6d.html" title="University of Kansas">University of Kansas</a> from 1919-1923. He worked part-time at the student Jayhawk Cafe to help pay his college expenses. He was a reserve on the basketball team under legendary coach Dr. <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phog_Allen_c7d9.html" title="Phog Allen">Forrest "Phog" Allen</a> from <a href="../../../1/9/1/1919_in_sports.html" title="1919 in sports">1919</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/2/1923_in_sports.html" title="1923 in sports">1923</a>. Assisting Allen during that time was his former coach and inventor of the game of basketball, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Naismith_3dbc.html" title="James Naismith">James Naismith</a>, who Rupp also got to know well during his time in Lawrence.</p>
<p>In Rupp's junior and senior seasons, 1922 and 1923, Kansas had outstanding squads which would later be awarded Helms titles as the top team in the nation those seasons.</p>

<p>After graduation, Rupp looked for opportunities in banking but soon opted to take a teaching and coaching job at Burr Oak (KS) High School. Disappointed in the facilities in Burr Oak, he later moved to Marshalltown Iowa where he coached wrestling, a sport he knew nothing about at the time and learned from a book.</p>
<p>In 1926-27, Rupp accepted the basketball head coaching position at Freeport High School where he also taught history. He stayed at the high school for four years, building a record of 59-21 and guiding his team to a third place finish in the 1929 state tournament.</p>
<p>During his time in Freeport, Rupp met his future wife Esther Schmidt. Rupp took summer classes at <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_University_082c.html" title="Columbia University">Columbia University</a> in New York City where he earned a Masters degree in education. He was also known to have travelled to nearby Madison Wisconsin to observe and learn from <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Wisconsin-Madison_a81d.html" title="University of Wisconsin-Madison">University of Wisconsin</a> basketball coach <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Meanwell_4fbc.html" title="Walter Meanwell">Walter "Doc" Meanwell</a>.</p>

<p>Rupp coached the <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kentucky_Wildcats_a7bf.html" title="Kentucky Wildcats">University of Kentucky</a> basketball team from <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930_in_sports.html" title="1930 in sports">1930</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972_in_sports.html" title="1972 in sports">1972</a>. At Kentucky, he earned the title <b>"Baron of <a href="../../../b/l/u/Bluegrass_region.html" title="Bluegrass region">the Bluegrass</a>"</b>. Rupp was a master of developing local talent. He took more than 80% of his players from Kentucky. He promoted a sticky man-to-man defense, and a relentless fast break offense that battered opponents into defeat. Rupp demanded 100% from his players at all times, pushing them to great levels of success.</p>
<p>His Wildcats teams won four <a href="../../../n/c/a/NCAA_Men%27s_Division_I_Basketball_Championship_caac.html" title="NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship">NCAA championships</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/4/1948_NCAA_Men%27s_Division_I_Basketball_Tournament_cee8.html" title="1948 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament">1948</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1949_NCAA_Men%27s_Division_I_Basketball_Tournament_e8c1.html" title="1949 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament">1949</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1951_NCAA_Men%27s_Division_I_Basketball_Tournament_b270.html" title="1951 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament">1951</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1958_NCAA_Men%27s_Division_I_Basketball_Tournament_7e71.html" title="1958 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament">1958</a>), one <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Invitation_Tournament_fe71.html" title="National Invitation Tournament">NIT</a> title in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946_in_sports.html" title="1946 in sports">1946</a> (when the NIT was a competitive tournament of national contenders), appeared in 20 NCAA tournaments and captured 27 <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southeastern_Conference_3deb.html" title="Southeastern Conference">Southeastern Conference</a> titles.</p>
<p>Rupp was forced into retirement in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972_in_sports.html" title="1972 in sports">1972</a> after reaching age 70, at that time the mandatory retirement age for Kentucky state employees.</p>

Rupp listened to the broadcast of the game from his hospital bed before finally succumbing to a protracted battle with spinal cancer and diabetes. He is interred at <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lexington_Cemetery_%28Kentucky%29_295d.html" title="Lexington Cemetery (Kentucky)">Lexington Cemetery</a> in Lexington, Kentucky. He died the same day as <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_United_States_3dfd.html" title="President of the United States">President</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodore_Roosevelt_3623.html" title="Theodore Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>'s younger daughter, <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethel_Roosevelt_Derby_cc40.html" title="Ethel Roosevelt Derby">Ethel Roosevelt Derby</a>.</p>

<p>24 of Rupp's players earned <a href="../../../a/l/l/All-America_7275.html" title="All-America">All-America</a> honors, seven won <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olympic_Games_4ea8.html" title="Olympic Games">Olympics</a> gold medals, and 28 played professionally. A four-time Coach of the Year, Rupp established a winning tradition at Kentucky later achieved only by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Wooden_d704.html" title="John Wooden">John Wooden</a> at <a href="../../../u/c/l/UCLA_052f.html" title="UCLA">UCLA</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dean_Smith_f8c5.html" title="Dean Smith">Dean Smith</a> at <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_North_Carolina_at_Chapel_Hill_49d1.html" title="University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill">North Carolina</a>. In 1969 Rupp recruited Tom Payne as the first African American to play on Kentucky's squad. This late date lead many to conclude that Rupp held racist views. This conclusion is inferred in the 2006 basketball film Glory Road. A little more than a year before his death, the Wildcats moved from their on-campus Memorial Coliseum to <a href="../../../r/u/p/Rupp_Arena_4d69.html" title="Rupp Arena">Rupp Arena</a>, named after him, in downtown <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lexington%2C_Kentucky_68e8.html" title="Lexington, Kentucky">Lexington</a>; the team continues to play there.
