<p>This account is not a fair analogy regarding Adolph Rupp. Coach Rupp attempted to recruit black players (i.e. Wes Unseld) as early as 1964. Tom Payne, Coach Rupp's first recruited black player signed in 1969. Darryl Bishop, another black athlete, was recruited to play football. However, he also played on the basketball team in 1969. Additionally, the University of Kentucky integrated its basketball team with black players before the following Southeastern Conference member schools: Florida, Louisiana State, Mississippi, Tennessee and Mississippi State.</p>
<p>There is overwhelming evidence that Coach Rupp WAS NOT a "segregationist". UK played home games against teams with black players beginning in 1948. The next "southern" school to allow this practice was Tennessee, which began permitting black players with visiting teams to play on the UT campus during the 1960s. Adolph Rupp coached black players as early as 1926, and coached Don Barksdale on the U.S. Olympic team in 1948.</p>
<p>For the most well-researched thesis on the subject, please see the following page by Jon Scott:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bigbluehistory.net/bb/rupp.html" class="external free" title="http://www.bigbluehistory.net/bb/rupp.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bigbluehistory.net/bb/rupp.html</a></p>
<p>His page is supported with numerous credible references. Thanks.</p>
<p>Some context for the infamous 1966 UK/Texas Western all-White vs. all-Black teams: <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_University_c8f9.html" title="Duke University">Duke</a>, which was also in the final four that year, also had no black players. If Duke had beaten UK in the semi-finals, would everybody be talking about Duke having a racist past? <a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERogerd_6b4d.html" title="User:Rogerd">Rogerd</a> 14:24, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>still, there isn't much discussion to the racist allegations, instead we have a sentence saying he was accused before being hit by a barrage of statements in his defense. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 71.214.68.13 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.214.68.13_8c14.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.214.68.13">contribs</a>) 22:11, January 29, 2006.</small></p>
<p>Adolph Rupp has been quoted by Frank Deford as calling the Miners "coons" during halftime of the national championship game. If he were not a racist, he wouldn't have used that language to motivate his players. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 68.33.88.35 (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.33.88.35.html" title="User talk:68.33.88.35">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.33.88.35_8590.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.33.88.35">contribs</a>) 21:49, February 8, 2006.</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>Everyone else who was present through the 1966 championship game disputes Deford's claim about the "coons" comment. No one is certain that Deford was even around Rupp at that game. For more information on this, see the site linked by someone else above.</dd>

<p>The article says, "The Adolph Rupp Trophy, named in his honor, has been awarded annually to the best white or black player in men's college basketball since 1972."</p>
<p>Is "best <i>white or black</i> player" really necessary? Why does race matter here? I don't think this award is limited to whites and blacks; an outstanding Asian or Latino could also win.</p>

<p>In the Criticisms section, I'm rather confused. See, I wanted to remove weasel words, and as I have no knowledge of this man whatsoever, I figured I'd be a good candidate for the job. But then I was reading it, and aside from being really confusing, what with various teams and names and whatnot that seem to be unrelated to the man himself and/or his career specifically, there's only one point in favor of the argument that he's viewed as a racist. Could someone please give more proof? Thanks <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENarnibird_be11.html" title="User:Narnibird">Narnibird</a> 20:05, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>p.s. and enough of the "he coached black high school students in Illinois" stuff, because seriously, wasn't that part of his job, given he was a high school coach? That does not mean he was not racist, it just means he did what he was told. <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENarnibird_be11.html" title="User:Narnibird">Narnibird</a> 20:08, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Are you kidding me? You want to say in the article that Rupp is a racist because he could not coach black players at Kentucky due to SEC policy until 1970, yet you think the fact that he coached black players as a high school coach was simply 'part of his job' and not evidence of whether or not he was a racist? It cuts both ways: either it was all just 'part of his job' or none of it was. Either both coaching black players in Illinois and not coaching them at Kentucky due to SEC policy 'just means he did what he was told' or neither does. Geez.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This entire 'Criticisms' section, since it cites no sources and is simply not based in fact, has been removed.</p>
