<p>Hi, about your comments at <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> - you can start someone with a test3 or test4 for egregious vandalism. It's a matter of style. Sometimes you'll be surprised though when a simple test or welcome stops someone. Most of the infantile type vandalism I start off slow, and generally if there is massive obscenity/racism/etc. I'll go straight to test4.

<dd>Just because your sources are biased, does not mean your encyclopedic entry needs to be... maybe change the lines to reads as "America and Germany had ships in the harbor", and calling it simply a 'disaster' instead of a 'catastrophe'... it may have truly been a catastrophe for the local natives and population, but on a global scale, was it really that bad?

Rather than deleting them, it's preferable to simply change them into redirects. There are two main reasons for this; GFDL compliance (the edit history of the merged material gets "left behind" at the old title) and convenience for people performing searches for or linking to the content.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">About the LGBT characters page</span></h2>
<p>Adolphus I'm really not sure what to decide on with this page's deletion. I think its a big waste of info, but at the same time as I said in the voting booth...every character gets some slight hint. Very few characters are strongly actually implied to be flat out gay...maybe not enough to warrent a page. But the convtoversy as well as pointing out the fact that there's a lot of satire over the subject of homosexuality on the Simpsons is I think worthy of some sort of attention.</p>
<p>The way its looking right now its probably going to be deleted regardless of what we do. But maybe something we can try is to make a "pop-culture impact" or just "pop-culture relevance" page in general to put information such as this into nicely organized foot notes. Things like the general satire thats seen on the show, including a foot note on LGBT. That would kill a lot of birds with one stone. What do you think? The show has had a lot of impact on pop culture with its various satire...I think its worthy of at least foot note.--<a href="../../../k/i/y/User%7EKiyosuki_aad2.html" title="User:Kiyosuki">Kiyosuki</a> 02:14, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Adolphus 79 - can you give me an idea why you put 'stub' on the Mystics article? It pretty much covers them and I have seen much shorter entries that are not marked stub. Any other input appreciated as well.</p>
<p>Thanks Annabells</p>
<dl>
<dd>stubs are nothing bad, all it really mean is that your article could use some expanding... it will help other editors find your article, and possibly add to it... as far as shorter articles than yours, yes, those are stubs also, maybe just not tagged yet... you have a very good start to an article there, it just needs a little cleanup, and some formatting... have fun, and happy editing... - <a href="../../../a/d/o/User%7EAdolphus79_aa38.html" title="User:Adolphus79">Adolphus79</a> 21:27, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I did not do that on purpose, and thank you, but I <i>can</i> spell properly... if you look at the history, you will see that someone else had gone though and fixed the spelling while I was editing for tags... the next edit is me fixing a couple of the reverted fixes, and saying 'oops' in the edit summary... and while I admit that I <i>should</i> have gone through and fixed all the typos that I reverted, I assumed that the editor who created the article would do so, and did not want to further step on his toes... that was just a quick visit last night as I was patrolling the new pages list... I have now reverted the article back to the proper spelling... have fun, and happy editing... - <a href="../../../a/d/o/User%7EAdolphus79_aa38.html" title="User:Adolphus79">Adolphus79</a> 02:48, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello Adolphus. I am very unhappy with your recent activity on CSD. I reviewed six of your nominations - and I had to decline ALL SIX. Let's review them (my edit summary in parentheses):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../j/u/d/Judge_Donald_Thompson_ff2e.html" title="Judge Donald Thompson">Judge Donald Thompson</a> (decline CSD - obviously. Take to AfD if you still want it deleted) - Significance is obviously asserted. Don't bother with prodding, since this person was quite notorious recently for jerking off on the bench during court hearings - I even read about him in the legal periodicals.</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/o/u/Jousei_Shounan_a629.html" title="Jousei Shounan">Jousei Shounan</a> (redirect instead of delete) - CSD A7 does NOT apply to fictional characters!</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/o/n/Jon_Cleary_9861.html" title="Jon Cleary">Jon Cleary</a> (decline CSD - obviously. Added many tags) - notability as writer is asserted. Why would you want it deleted, unless it were a hoax??</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/e/r/Jeremy_Goss_4236.html" title="Jeremy Goss">Jeremy Goss</a> (decline CSD - obviously. Added many tags) - notability as football player is obvious!! Why, again would you want it deleted??</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/o/n/Jon_Turley_ac26.html" title="Jon Turley">Jon Turley</a> (decline CSD, prod instead. Notability as author is asserted) - I agree with deletion, but not speedy deletion, as the article clearly states he had been published.</li>
<li>Jory Twist (redirect instead of delete) - CSD A7 does NOT apply to fictional characters!</li>
</ul>
<p>You're WAY off base. You need to seriously re-read <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>. I suggest taking a week off CSD'ing things altogether, while you recalibrate. This is really something awful.

<dd>I'm sorry about that, I really am... but if those were the only ones not to qualify, I guess it's not so bad... I think I tagged about 50 in total... I was working on <a href="../../../d/e/a/Wikipedia%7EDead-end_pages_9f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Dead-end pages">Wikipedia:Dead-end pages</a>, and to be honest, I must disagree with you for a moment... I only tagged the articles that <i>as I read them</i> did not prove notability of the subject... whether the subject truly is notable or not, I did not feel that the article proved that... I understand that the subject <i>might</i> be notable enough for inclusion in Wikipedia, and that someone <i>might</i> come along later and expand the subject, but when I read the article, it <i>did not assert the importance or significance of its subject</i>...</dd>
<dd>I have to admit, it was late at night when I did that, and the fictional characters should have just been redirected... I know that now... I guess the only real excuse I have is that those 6 articles above just happened to get tossed in with the several dozens of other vanity and obviously non-notable articles that I tagged last night... well, that and me still being a noob...</dd>
<dd>as far as taking a break, you're right... I've only been registered for 2 months now, and I've already made almost (if not more than) 4000 edits... I've been considering taking a WikiBreak myself... the vandals always come back, the deleted articles always come back, what's the point? I will be on a forced WikiBreak during most of July as I am moving, I'm not sure how active I will be when I come back, as it really doesn't seem to matter... don't worry about being harsh, no worries... you're right, those 6 articles did not qualify for speedy... have fun, and happy editing... - <a href="../../../a/d/o/User%7EAdolphus79_aa38.html" title="User:Adolphus79">Adolphus79</a> 19:46, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Dude, just to be clear. I reviewed seven of yours, I think. Re-read CSD carefully. No assertion of significance. X is a football player in the big leagues = assertion. X is writer = assertion. X is a judge = even THAT is an assertion. X is a judge who jerked off on the bench and was fired for it = that's FOR SURE an assertion. A7 - no assertion of notability. X is an emo kid from n00b high school - no assertion.

<p>A note to interested parties... I had added an entry for Qwigybo in the Simpsons' <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_simpsons#Impact_on_language" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_simpsons#Impact_on_language" rel="nofollow">impact on language</a> but it was edited out. Someone else had earlier suggested a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_creation/2006-07-11#Qwigybo" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_creation/2006-07-11#Qwigybo" rel="nofollow">separate entry</a> for it entirely, citing its <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/qwigybo" class="external text" title="http://www.answers.com/topic/qwigybo" rel="nofollow">mention</a> on Answers.com. Not sure I agree with that, but perhaps it would fit better within the neologisms. Anyway, of course it was a joke but the whole point was in creating language so I can't imagine a better fit for one of these two areas. Sorry if I misspelled it; I do not know the exact episode where it appears right now but I can provide it later.
