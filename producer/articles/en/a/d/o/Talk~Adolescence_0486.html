<p>This section does not seem to conform at all to NPOV; the sweeping generalizations and lack of citations are all of great concern. I agree with 202.2.32.27 that the input of an expert is necessary here; unfortunately, the corresponding section in <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolescent_psychology.html" title="Adolescent psychology">Adolescent psychology</a> has the same problem. I've put neutrality tags on both of them - anyone else think these need to be rewritten? <a href="../../../a/b/i/User%7EAbigali_c8ea.html" title="User:Abigali">Abigali</a> 08:50, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes... i do, i removed a chunk of the most biased info including the part on teenagers 'emotional insecurity' and the unproven parts of teen sexuality and teen sexual behaviour. I put in a few statistics from a January 2005, centers for disease control study on teen sex that at least has some data, although info on foreign policy, data, statistics on teen sexual behaviour is widely varied. (I especially found the part which said 'teens usually have sex or make sexual contact out of a 'hook up' was quite.... shall we just say. DOWNRIGHT WRONG! PUT IN SOME DMAN EVIDENCE DAMNIT!!!!.</p>
<p>Although this section still needs A LOT OF EDITING!.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.history-of-rock.com/teenagers.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.history-of-rock.com/teenagers.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.history-of-rock.com/teenagers.htm</a></p>
<p>Is a link on the references and when i visited it i found HIGHLY BIASED completely unbacked opininated information. When i tried to find this link to the offending page I couldn't find it in the edit code where it was supposed to be. Although it still shows up on the page and is an active link, if someone could help with locating the link and removing it that would be much appreciated.</p>
<dl>
<dd>That source is used as a reference backing up the fact concerning when the word "teenager" came into use.

<p>damnit.... could someone PLEASE EXPLAIN why they restored the text i deleted IWTHOUT CITING A GOOD REASON?. It was entirely backe4d up, the websites listed as reference are of a right wing nature and themselves contain unproven facts, and the centers for disease control data. WHICH IS LEGIT AND I POSTED WITH A LINK! HAS BEEN DELETED.</p>
<p>I'm restoring the CDC data and deleting the text until someone comes up with viable information, please note iwill also try and contact an admin to put protection on this article.</p>

<li>First of all, you deleted more than what was simply pertaining to sexuality. If you are going to edit and delete, please be more careful. Secondly, your data (at least part of it) was included. My first revert yesterday included the piece about contraception. I accidently missed the part about the birth rate dropping, but it has been restored. See footnotes 19 and 21. As to the other points, US News &amp; World Reports is hardly a right-wing publication. There are other sources listed in there from the CDC, the US Dept of Health &amp; Human Services, the Journal Pediatrics &amp; the Medical College of Wisconson you deleted as well. If you would like to refute Dr. Sax then by all means <a href="../../../b/e/_/WP%7EBe_Bold_2c3b.html" title="WP:Be Bold">WP:Be Bold</a>, but don't simply delete it because you don't like what he says. Also, be sure you can offer evidence to back it up. Sax has an MD and PhD, so I am sure he would not get published if he did not have evidence to him back up. Finally, please calm down a bit. There is no need to get all excited, nor to use profanity.

<p>also.... if there should be a seperate article on teen sexuality WHY IS THERE AN ENTIRE MINI ARTCIEL ON IT WHICH IJUST CLAIMED WAS NON NUETRAL AND FALSE???!!!</p>
<p>deleted biased information.. again!, highly request protection ASAP. Leonard sax's info is highly biased and weakly backed up. The KFF/CDC info i put in was replaced with older outdated info which contributes even more to the biased and unscientifically proven materials that seems to be hypocritical of the articles own words....</p>
<p>The links are also FILLED with antisexual information that would not be helpful to a parent or teenager looking for a good reference on teenaged sexuality.</p>
<p>If a seperate article is to be then i think it'll need discussion as there is too much trolling the info to fit into particular relegious political ideologies.</p>

<p>What ocncerns me the most is how the article says that teenagers are incapable of dealing with the emotions etc. that come with sex, how it does far more harm then good, and how it says teenaged sexual relations are usually hook-ups*.</p>
<pre>
*how do you define hook-ups?
* has there been a reasonable study proving this?
*has leanoard sax EVER gotten the opinions of teenagers themselves?
</pre>
<p>I myself havn't been able to find any of his books, although Judith Levine's book, harmful to minors: the perils of protecting children from sex will tell you exactly the opposite.</p>
<p>Plus, CDC data stating STD rates are now at 88 per 1,000 HARDLY seems to be an 'epidemic', except in the hispanic and african ethnicities where it tends to be a little bit higher. If you can i'd like to see some studies to back up the above points WHICH are preferably not from Sax, if they are then PLEASE give me the source of the study....</p>
<p>(note that the CDC study link had been removed and i'd like it to be reinserted, also. I'm going to move the CDC data up towards the top of adolescent sexuality/psychology because of the multitudes of data saying sex between teenagers is dangerous.</p>
<p>This should help to balance it out in case some parent reads it and doesn't even get to the bottom having decided (MY daughter can't have sex!!, this data says she'll become depressed!!!) I'd prefer the links to studies proving the depression as well.</p>
<p>PLUS we need a world view and studies from at least more countries then the United states, as this presents a problem to people visiting this page who are from other but english speaking countries.</p>
<p>I'll also try and find some data on european views on adolescent seuxal activity (I have some and can get some more), and i must say the house-of-rock page is itself heavily biased and deriving the origin of the term 'teenager' might seem, upon close inspection.... a bit unreliable.</p>
<p>P.S. sry for the shouting, but I really DO consider this information to be biased and completely un-nuetral as well as opinionated.</p>

<p>P.S.S.</p>
<p>I would REALLY appreciate it if more sources backing up the claims of harm done to teenagers from sex/ intoxication causing it/reducing embarrasment could be provided 'hopefully' in internet form that are seperate from Leonard sax's theories as a LARGE amount of ther references are from Leonard Sax and it would be gratefully acknowledged if you could come up with more sources to back up Sax's claims due to his ideas and facts filling up a lot of the topic of teen sexuality.</p>
<p>Oh yes... I'm wondering about a seperate wikipedia article SPECIFICALLY for teen sexuality and activity/behaviour due to the fact that it is a bit long and if info about other countries are included the length might be increased DRAMATICALLY.</p>
<p>Thus warranting another article based solely on this.</p>

<p>The entire section is poorly sourced and highly subjective. It is obviously biased because any intro Psychology text will tell you that this teenage crisis thing is not known in many parts of the world, so many of the problems discussed in the passages can be debatable.</p>
<p>However, we must have a civil debate. It's best to avoid sweeping generalizations, and to cite every controversial statement you make. Let's start doing that. <a href="../../../x/i/n/User%7EXiner_4ce3.html" title="User:Xiner">Xiner</a> (<a href="../../../x/i/n/User_talk%7EXiner_ca85.html" title="User talk:Xiner">talk</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Xiner_41d9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Xiner">email</a>) 02:35, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Guidelines to be kept in mind: Unsourced statements may be deleted; opinions should not be stated as facts (even if an expert said it); credibly sourced statements should not deleted (do not throw the baby out with the bathwater). <a href="../../../x/i/n/User%7EXiner_4ce3.html" title="User:Xiner">Xiner</a> (<a href="../../../x/i/n/User_talk%7EXiner_ca85.html" title="User talk:Xiner">talk</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Xiner_41d9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Xiner">email</a>) 21:47, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree, and that is why I have reverted the edits made by Nateland. I am sure he is well intentioned, but his writing leaves much to be desired and it has been pointed out here and on his talk page that he can not simply delete material he disagrees with. He does, as you say, throw the baby out with the bath water. The older text may be biased, but at least it is readable.
<ul>
<li>Biased text does not belong in Wikipedia, and if Nateland's edits are not written well, please try to polish it instead of reverting. Also, please sign in if you have an account, and sign your messages. If you believe anyone's removed properly sourced material, please give me the diffs. <a href="../../../x/i/n/User%7EXiner_4ce3.html" title="User:Xiner">Xiner</a> (<a href="../../../x/i/n/User_talk%7EXiner_ca85.html" title="User talk:Xiner">talk</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Xiner_41d9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Xiner">email</a>) 21:47, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't want to take sides here, but Nateland's offered to discuss his text here. I urge the other side to do the same. <a href="../../../x/i/n/User%7EXiner_4ce3.html" title="User:Xiner">Xiner</a> (<a href="../../../x/i/n/User_talk%7EXiner_ca85.html" title="User talk:Xiner">talk</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Xiner_41d9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Xiner">email</a>) 21:49, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The sections on "Psychology of adolescents" and "Adolescent sexuality" consist mostly of biased commentary, and mainly pertain to the United States. Many of the statements seem to be supported by an <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeal_to_authority.html" title="Appeal to authority">appeal to authority</a> rather than actual data.

<p>I hope this can be used as a temporary replacement for the section on teen sexuality due to it's easily verifiable and trustworthy nature. (The Centers For Disease Control are pretty reliable in my opinion and many others) Plus it's layout would EASILY allow for inclusion of information on adolescent sexual activity and sexuality in other countries.. oh yes i'm thinking. Could someone come up with some internet sources to show that adolescents have as diverse sexual orientations as adults?, that would be a given and add some more info other then statistics on pregnancy and STD transmission.</p>
<p>I myself KNOW that teenagers (I myself am a teenager, a little over 14) have varied orientations both homo, heterosexual, and paraphilic, but do ont know of many good studies or surveys to prove this point which aren't under hot debate.</p>
<p>below is my idea of a good temporary replacement, i've also contacted an admin a few days ago to see if they can help out in this matter. 9Not sure if they'll get back to me though)</p>

<p>While a highly controversial topic, both sides of the issue for and against this activity have been fighting fiercely to prove their points on both relegious, secular, scientific, and statistical grounds.</p>
<p>This section deals with....</p>
<p>Adolescent Sexual Activity In The United States</p>
<p>Research (Shown in the paragraph below) HAS proven In The United States however that pregnancy and std transmission in sexually active teens has gone down dramatically over the past 10 years, both of which have been leading secular reasons for stopping adolescent sexual activity (For pregnancy this is vaginal intercourse and for STD's like HIV it is anal, oral, or vaginal sex that counts towards the statistics, other STD's like syphillis etc. are available at the reference page)</p>
<p>Centers For Disease Control study On Rates For STD, and Pregnancy in United States teens</p>
<p>Of US teens aged 15-19 who are having sexual intercourse almost all (98%) use at least one form of contraception. The most popular form, at 94% usage, are condoms and the birth control pill at 61%. [4]</p>
<p>U.S. teen pregnancies had decreased 28% between 1990 and 200 from 117 pregnancies of every 1,000 to 84 per 1,000 by the year 2,000.[5]</p>
<p>Plase note however that WORLDWIDE: "Genital HPV infection is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) that is caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). Human papillomavirus is the name of a group of viruses that includes more than 100 different strains or types. More than 30 of these viruses are sexually transmitted, and they can infect the genital area of men and women including the skin of the penis, vulva (area outside the vagina), or anus, and the linings of the vagina, cervix, or rectum. Most people who become infected with HPV will not have any symptoms and will clear the infection on their own."[6]</p>
<p>Also, in the case of HPV condoms DO NOT completely stop the risk of contraction oh HPV, however the use of condoms has been shown by studies to lower the risk of getting this Disease[7]</p>
<p>Some of these viruses are called "high-risk" types, and may cause abnormal Pap tests. They may also lead to cancer of the cervix, vulva, vagina, anus, or penis. Others are called "low-risk" types, and they may cause mild Pap test abnormalities or genital warts. Genital warts are single or multiple growths or bumps that appear in the genital area, and sometimes are cauliflower shaped. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENateland_dd34.html" title="User:Nateland">Nateland</a> (<a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENateland_ee2a.html" title="User talk:Nateland">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nateland_a30c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nateland">contribs</a>) 21:55, 6 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<li>Nateland, you may not have anything to do on a Saturday night/ Sunday morning, but plenty of us did. 12 hours is not a sufficient time period to achieve consensus on something like this. In general, several days is a good rule of thumb. Most of us don't hover over WP constantly, so you can't assume that since no one raises any objections within a few hours that we all agree. Further, what was on there contained good info on health &amp; pregnancy, but you deleted much on psychological issues. I did like creating a subsection about US teens. Finally, <i>again</i>, don't simply delete material you disagree with. What is posted is from experts in easily verifiable sources. Find other sources to back up what you believe if you want. I've reverted to the old text. --<a href="../../../i/l/l/User%7EIlluminato_0afe.html" title="User:Illuminato">Illuminato</a> 03:34, 8 January 2007 (UTC) PS - The note you added is not part of the WP style.

<p>Due to the dispute about the leonard sax information being filled in on the sexuality section I put in just general STD info until it could be resolved.... (I was thinking it would be neutral enough just as a basic filler until this dispute could be fixed)</p>
<p>Although now that it's al lback to the old junk I'm thinking the same thing Xiner, adolescent sex should be relegated to the MAIN topic of sexuality (Maybe the portal or something?, or inside the article on human sexual behaviour?), and then once it's there we can all argue and fuss over what goes in it.</p>

<p>If it was in human sexual behaviour then we could link off into the various other subjects of sexuality as teenagers DO have a diverse range of sexual behaviours including homosexuality and paraphilia's and thus it would allow for GREATER expansion of this topic which needs much information.</p>
<p>And to Illuminato, I know i shouldn't have deleted it. But it's ALL from Leonard Sax!, THAT'S the problem, we need info from BOTH sides of the debate and if it's all LEONARD SAX!, then well.... maybe we should have a for and against section. But I think that what i stated in my post above would be quite fitting as it IS general sexuality.</p>
<p>Then we'll let the larger audience shred it to bits and feud over the content. Although I think that BEFORE we even THINK of sticking it in the sexuality portal we'll need to create a NEW section that is acceptable to the 4 of us as i see it.</p>
<p>That means once it's as neutral as WE and any OTHER people who join in think it ought to be THEN we can discuss amongst ourselves the issue of merging it with the sexuality portal or one of it's subarticles.</p>
<p>What do you think Illuminato/people?</p>

<li>WP is not a place to have debates with for and against sections. You did not place those new sections in the sexuality section, so please be more careful in the future. A lot of the info you had was duplicated, so I removed what was in there twice. Also, please get a full cite for the Levine source. Your original text said she was a journalist, is she also an expert in teenage sexuality? If she is not, I question whether what would only be her opinion should be included. I left it in for the time being, until you get the full cite. Finally, there are 18 cited sources in this section, and only 5 of them are from Sax. Thats a far cry from "ALL."--<a href="../../../i/l/l/User%7EIlluminato_0afe.html" title="User:Illuminato">Illuminato</a> 00:34, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>A few random thoughts about the edit war:</dd>
<dd>We don't always have to break things out into pro/con terms. That often isn't the best way of presenting different opinions. In this case, I think we can come up with something more nuanced than "for" and "against" sections. You can't look at a study and decide whether the study is for or against adolescent sexuality, so these sections won't work. We should also be careful to say that a study has proven its conclusion. We can say things like "according to a study by..." or "researchers at xyz wrote that..." but we should not say "Research (Shown in the paragraph below) HAS proven". With that said, the quotes from Leonard Sax are excessive, placed too highly, and the way they are used is a violation of the NPOV policy. There are even opinionated statements which are written in Wikipedia's own voice - absolutely prohibited by NPOV. For example, the sentence "The harm done to teenagers who engage in sexual activities is especially true for girls" must be removed. I am placing an NPOV tag on this section and I hope that we will hear from people other than Illuminato and Nateland here. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 00:42, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Is that really a source we want to be using here? From the wikpedia page on <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harmful_to_Minors_8b16.html" title="Harmful to Minors">Harmful to Minors</a>: "Because of its controversial nature and content, it was nearly impossible for Levine to find a publisher — one prospective publisher even called it "radioactive." A book that was nearly impossible to publish because it was so extreme doesnt really sound like the type of sources we should be using here.

<dd>It's a pretty well-known book and it got a lot of press coverage, not all of which was negative. Joycelyn Elders wrote the foreword. It's an opinionated source, but it is a good source for describing the opinions of those who believe sexuality is normal in teenagers. Please re-read the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> policy.

<dd>True, it got a lot of press but only because it was so controversial. I don't think anyone is arguing that sexuality isn't normal in teenagers, just whether or not it is healthy for them to be acting on those instincts. Anyway, from the quote provided, this book seems to argue that sex is good for children. I haven't read it, but the only other people I know making that argument in NAMBLA. --<a href="../../../i/l/l/User%7EIlluminato_0afe.html" title="User:Illuminato">Illuminato</a> 03:14, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, i was just trying to make a compromise that wouldn't be reverted by making for and against sections.</p>
<p>Because.. due to the controversial nature of this topic I think that it requires views from both sides AS WELL as general info (which was deleted multiple times by illuminato) Yes, i recognize i am biased FOR teenage sex and that's the reason i am contending it's current state so much.</p>
<p>I was thinking that with for and against sections as well as a general info (probably statistical and scientific) it would be more informative due... as i said earlier there might be people coming to this page (As it's #1 on googles search for adolescence) for advice and I am worried that the current constantly reverted to section on sexuality WILL cause possible confusion and misguided ideas about the adolescent sex that will NOT be in the interest of the person affected by it.</p>
<p>YES, my FOR section was pov, i was going to add more info and statisttics from the book (Of which there are many), although since I think that judith's book is like a highly liberal version of leonard sax's highly conservative book it's not a very good book for use in wikipedia.</p>
<p>But i DO think that accurate, straight information WHICH tells EXACTLY what the effects and/or consequences of teen sex as WELL as info on contraception, and views of various organizations on this perhaps, WITH some polls of the views on teen sex from teenagers myself.</p>

<p>Now, a minor concern is that the Part on HPV. WHICH can be partially prevented via condom usage (A Centers For disease control link was PLACED within EASY clicking distance to prove this point that it can lower it's risk and yet....</p>
<p>It keeps getting changed to (Oh it cannot be prevented by condoms or anything blah blah blah)</p>
<p>Now what arouses my suspicions is that people against sex among adolescence would do ANYTHING to make sex seem dangerous no matter what.</p>
<p>Even if it's just a little virus, and Illuminato.</p>
<p>HPV can lay dormant for YEARS. So if you get it before you marry, you marry, and you have sex. you can STILL contract HPV!, so EVEN MARRIAGE isn't any good when faced with what you term 'unpreventable diseases' I think i'll add in that part.</p>
<p>Also, the article seems to be doing ok. BUT!, even though most of Leonard Sax's quotes have been removed. There are still parts which i find, oddly unverifiable. I'll check them out though just to make sure.</p>

<p>teens - and preteens - are too young to fathom the consequences, both physical and emotional, of" sexual activities.</p>
<p>How is that able to be PROVEN?, that's not a very provable point. Comes from world news.</p>
<p>impersonality of twenty-first-century adolescent sex victimizes girls" and "plenty of harm" is done to boys as well.[9] When taking part in hookups "the kids don't even look at each other. It's mechanical, dehumanizing. The fallout is that later in life they have trouble forming relationships. They're jaded.</p>
<p>I have sources to indicate that sex ACTUALLY HELPS relationships form later in life by giving teens the tools to make love, negotiate, and more.</p>
<p>, a professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco and author of The Sex Lives of Teenagers, "early initiation into sexual behaviors [takes] a toll on teens' mental health. The result, she says, can be 'dependency on boyfriends and girlfriends, serious depression around breakups and cheating, [and a] lack of goals.'</p>
<p>This came from World news too. In fact BOTH of these are from a 2005 article that i doubt ANYONE can easily get to. I'm requesting that the person who posted this PROVIDES THE ARTICLE ON-LINE ALONG WITH IT'S SOURCES.</p>
<p>Otherwise it breaks a wikipedia policy (Can't remember which one though), but WHO keeps year old newspapers?, not many people would have the article on hand to verify judging by that. AND newspapers don't usually list sources except random or 'specially picked' scientists who might not have A CLUE what they're talking about. I'm HEAVILY in favor of removing the US and world news report paragraphs and checking into the statement that teens become 'jaded'.</p>

<p>Yes, the topic of adolescent sexuality is WAAAYYY to trolled. The part on HPV has been reverted AGAIN and the main article on Adolescent sexuality IS a identical copy.</p>
<p>We've got a MAJOR problem with trollers and I think that we should try and keep the adolescent sexuality part OUT of this article and in the main article on that topic.</p>
<p>EVEN if it means a never ending edit war, we can always try and call in an administrator.</p>
<p>Now... with the main article on adolescent sexuality, I'm up for some revising of it to get rid of any POV statements and try to present all major sides of the debate in a clearly visible manner (This to me is a big problem as I myself am an advocate FOR allowing teenagers to have consensual sex with the use of contraception and whenever I've managed to introduce that side of the debate into the article and it wasn't reverted... well, it was shoved down at the bottom and out of sight basically. )</p>
<p>It looks like we'll need to put in a <i>lot</i> of effort for this. In the meantime I'll check over the main article, add some neutrality tags to the section on this adolescence article.</p>
<p>And I think I'll delete the section here as it's already in the main article on adolescent sexuality (Whomever created it... probably that annoying pest Illuminato when he/she/herma :-) was looking for a way to sneak in a few POV statements, I apologize if i was wrong about Illuminato making it.. but he's given me A LOT of trouble in the past with this topic.</p>

<p>I reverted a recent edit by Nateland where he completely removed a section of the article because another article covered the same topic. However, to quote from <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html#Article_spinouts_-_.22Summary_style.22_articles" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">WP's guideline on spinout articles</a>, having a summary of a main article is a "completely normal Wikipedia procedure." The <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">Summary style</a> guideline in a nutshell says "When articles grow too long, longer sections should be spun off into their own articles and a several paragraph summary should be left in its place. Such sections are linked to the detailed article with a {{main|&lt;name of detailed article&gt;}} or comparable template under the section title." That is what was there, and what I returned.</p>
<p>Edit the summary to improve it if you like, Nateland, but please do not delete it again. Also, when you make a change of more than 10,000, it is not a minor change. I will assume good faith and consider it a mistake, but please take care not to misuse the minor change button in the future.--<a href="../../../i/l/l/User%7EIlluminato_0afe.html" title="User:Illuminato">Illuminato</a> 04:40, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The sexuality section was really long - three pages of text. It is now summarized in the Adolescence article as one and a half pages of text. I think that is still kind of long. Maybe it would be less time consuming to delete this section for now and focus efforts on the <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolescent_sexuality.html" title="Adolescent sexuality">Adolescent sexuality</a> article.

<p>We sometimes give an alternative formulation of the non-bias policy: assert facts, including facts about opinions — but do not assert opinions themselves. There is a difference between facts and opinions. By "fact" we mean "a piece of information about which there is no serious dispute." For example, that a survey produced a certain published result would be a fact. That there is a planet called Mars is a fact. That Plato was a philosopher is a fact. No one seriously disputes any of these things. So we can feel free to assert as many of them as we can.</p>

<li>I agree that this doesn't represent a worldwide viewpoint, but to be honest, I'm not even sure that this represents a US viewpoint. Since when is it abnormal and horrible for adolescents to explore their sexuality? It seems that many on this talk page raised their eyebrows a bit while reading this section.

<p>Especially the section on teen sexuality- sounds like someone had a bad relationship at 15 and decided to make up a load of rubbish. This whole "hook-up" thing is nonsense, and teenagers can be just as emotionally developed as physically developed, although some may not be. I changed it to make it a bit more subtle a while ago (but not <b>necessarily</b> emotionally, for instance) but the edits were removed; this information is completely biased and incorrect. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.67.162.83_4b63.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.67.162.83">84.67.162.83</a> (talk) 23:01, 9 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<li>Yes, I agree completely! I previously didn't want to say anything about that, but it does seem like someone was hurt in the past, has come up with a hypothesis based on their own emotional disturbances, and then tried to find opinions that corroborated with the hypothesis (rather than the other way around).

<p>Well, Illuminato was the user who created this section. And his record of using reverts to keep favored POV inside of articles. Then creating spin-off articles to try and ward away complaints or when his favored materials are in danger of being removed and kept removed due to consensus by more than 3 wikipedians. As well as using varying tactics to try and validate his actions. Makes me think he is a simple POV-pusher who, even if he DID have bad experiences shouldn't act this way on such a simple website.</p>
<p>Also, the main article on adolescent sexuality has been updated and thus the current section should be updated. The section itself seems irrelevant to the article on adolescents worldwide as a whole and I say it should be removed and a link at the top of the article saying 'for the article on adolescent sexuality see <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolescent_sexuality.html" title="Adolescent sexuality">adolescent sexuality</a>. There is strong opposition to the current and the exact same data has been literally copy &amp; pasted into numerous other spin-off articles.</p>

<p>"All teens have sexual lives". That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. I myself am 13 years old and I have no sex life at all, real or fictional (not that I want one). Why did they invent such a stupid thing? There are many teenagers like me around the world, and in my opinion, one of the writer's next statements "Sexual life is important for teenagers" is also incorrect as we see that many of the teenagers with sexual lives are rude, irresponsible and very noisy, a trait which most of the teenagers without sexual lives do not possess. You may think I am inventing this, but I have my sources as I have moved a school in the last year and I've been researching the behaviour of the 2000 (approximately) students in my school and of the 3500 (approximately) in my old school by doing surveys. I have finished explaining my point.</p>

<p>Directed at Illuminato.</p>
<p>When I edited the section on adolescent sexuality I removed the phrases by ponton lynn saying sexuality is a vital part of teenagers lives. (Sexuality is important to people, but not neccesarily vital, and the phrase seems out of place. Especially considering ponton lynn's views are U.S. centric).</p>
<p>And the phrase saying adolescents might not be psychologically mature enough to have sex and could face emotional distress. I'll need clarification. What kind of emotional distress?, how can willingly having sex make you emotionally unstable?. I thought if people had a sexual drive strong enough to make them initiate sex they'd be emotionally capable of withstanding the pleasures sex can bring them.</p>

<dd>I disagree that Dr. Ponton's quote there is US centric. If anything, you have made the section more US centric. The words "United States" did not appear in that section before your recent edit. It is well documented that distress can result from sexual activity before a teen is ready for it and you can find it on the other articles on this topic. Your brain does not fully develop until you are into your mid twenties and having a strong sex drive does not mean you are emotionally prepared for sex. All the evidence is to the contrary, in fact. If you can find a source that says physical capability means emotional readiness I will certainly look at it, but I don't think you will be able to find one. --<a href="../../../i/l/l/User%7EIlluminato_0afe.html" title="User:Illuminato">Illuminato</a> 04:15, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Saying they're not emotionally mature, (when in the context of your revert stated it as universal fact that all adolescents are harmed by sex) is a broad statement to make. Maybe not brain size wise etc. But in the context of sexuality that can only serve one purpose. POV. And POV is what started this whole 3 months long debate...</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, saying adolescent sexuality is of concern to the wider society inside of an article on adolescence worldwide is a pretty big statement to make. Can you back that up with worldwide facts, quotes, statistics, and proofs of consensus among all classes and races and peoples?. (That's how you'd have to reasonably prove such a statement )</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And no Illuminato, proving your facts is up to <i>you</i>. Wiki policy says that the poster of a controversial statement has to provide the proof for it. Don't just dump the burden of proof on <i>me</i>.</dd>
<dd>That's all for now. And <i>please</i> refrain from edit warring so much. It's causing many people trouble and grief. (Don't you have other things to do then just patrol a small category of wikipedia articles looking for changes not to your liking?). <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENateland_dd34.html" title="User:Nateland">Nateland</a> 04:53, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First, please do not edit my comments, even if for typos. Formating is one thing, changing text is quite another. Secondly, there is loads and loads of research that says teens bodies mature far faster than their emotional or cognitive abilities. Just pick up a copy of any medical or psychological journal, particularly one dealing with young people - Adolescence is excellent. If you want specifics from that journal try "Adolescent Sex And Mass Media: A Developmental Approach" by John Chapman at Penn State, or if books are more to your liking read "Today's children: Creating a future for a generation in crisis." by David Hamburg. Its a cruel irony, in fact, that while teens bodies are maturing faster than ever we are prolonging their adolescence. I don't envy you being so young in this day and age. --<a href="../../../i/l/l/User%7EIlluminato_0afe.html" title="User:Illuminato">Illuminato</a> 05:19, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Illuminato, you've critisized me and claimed immaturity on my behalf because of minor typos instead of fixing them. I simply fixed a few typos on your behalf as a <i>courtesy</i>. If you don't want me to show you courtesy then fine. Say so and I won't. Also, stating that adolescents aren't mature enough to have sex is not a small or even <i>proven</i> statement. The burden of proof is on you. And in case you didn't realize, back a couple centuries ago people went out into the world around age 14 and had children at even younger ages almost regularly in some parts due to much shorter average human lifespans...</p>
<p>Yet, despite young sex the world continued on. Nowadays with modern technology people live longer and thus it seems the expectation to have sex later has popped up or just simply increased due to this fact. Trust me, if your statement is true then about 200-1,000 years ago the world would have been frought with emotionally devastated people. Now which is truer?.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thousands of years of history.</li>
<li>Or the opinions of a few dozen scientists in narrow scoped fields that were formed within the last 50 years or so?.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not saying life back then was necessarily <i>fun</i> for the average person. But it was filled with much more <i>evil</i> then today. War, death, rape. Yet even <i>young</i> children saw and normally lived through it if disease didn't get them first. And back then it seems no one thought <i>twice</i> about having children as soon as possible or as soon as necessary.</p>
<p>I'm reverting your edits <a href="../../../i/l/l/User%7EIlluminato_0afe.html" title="User:Illuminato">User:Illuminato</a>. And if I have to, I'll go all the way up the ladder to get you blocked. P.S. the burden of proof is on <i>you</i>. Did you <i>read</i> all of the above?. Or did you just choose to 'conveniently' ignore parts of what I said?. 20:12, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nateland, changing text in an article is one thing, doing it on a talk page is another. In an article the text belongs to WP and anyone can edit it. On talk pages what I said is mine. It is my thoughts I am conveying, and should not be be changed by others. There is a difference. Also, please read <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">WP:MOS</a> and you will see that the word "sexuality" in the in section title should be lowercase. Just look at the other sections in this very article. All multiple word titles only have the first word capitalized. Finally, the sentence said that teenagers are not emotionally or cognitively mature yet. Our brains our still developing into our mid-twenties. This is not the opinion of a few rouge scientists, this is fact. I have cited two sources saying it is true - where are your sources saying it isn't? Show me good science saying a 14 year old is emotionally mature and I will read it with an open mind, but I don't think you will find one. You can't delete cited material simply because you don't like it. If it is untrue, thats one thing, but you have not shown me anything that says it isn't. --<a href="../../../i/l/l/User%7EIlluminato_0afe.html" title="User:Illuminato">Illuminato</a> 03:36, 8 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Illuminato, maybe that statement <i>is</i> fact. But its placement in that section gives a tone saying adolescent sex <i>is</i> going to harm adolescents psychologically in the least. And saying it's particularly of concern to people. WHAT people?, people in the united states?. Sure, there's a big enough culture war over adolescent sex in the US. Worldwide?, I don't think so.</p>
<p>Because of this placement of your <i>facts</i> it violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. I'm reverting your edits for neutrality. They belong in the part on culture or social aspects of adolescence. NOT in a section where they make sexual activity look inherently damaging. OH yes, Illuminato. Can you quit going on about spelling and punctuation?, people make mistakes. THat doesn't mean their views on a subject are meaningless.... <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENateland_dd34.html" title="User:Nateland">Nateland</a> 15:49, 8 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just edited the Adolescence Psychology section and cited all the references, I also made the section neutral, earlier it was just referring to the Adolescent Psychological process as being mostly negative. I have now added factually verified information and have removed the phrases which didn't really mean anything and/or were just misleading and most of all, were unsourced.</p>
<p>Do not revert the changes, you could visit the references to verify all the information I have added. <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorrectus_da62.html" title="User:Correctus">Correctus</a> 14:58, 8 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Added a new picture to the article of a few teenagers in Nicaragua, the image itself is public domain and was found in the "Boys" category of Wikipedia's public domain images. There are no old people in the picture so I dont think there would be any more problems regarding the introductory image.
