<h2><span class="mw-headline">Fascism, Totalitarianism, response to Str1977 post above</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>I acknowledge different theoretical perspectives (liberal, Marxist, social democratic, and conservative), inevitably giving rise to rival generic models. However, ‘fascism’ (small ‘f’, as large ‘F’ is conventionally reserved for the original Italian Fascism) has been widely accepted as a generic term by most historians and writers on political ideology and history, and this is clearly not going to change; the majority of scholars in the field agree that there is substance to warrant such usage. Due to its huge historical impact and brutality, the German National Socialist movement and regime has received the most intensive study, both in its own right and as a possible variety of fascism. But in spite of this Mussolini’s regime remains something of an exemplar for international fascism.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I acknowledge differences between Nazism and Italian Fascism. Who doesn’t? I addressed this point in some detail already, stemming both from distinct fascist routes reflective of national differences both for the origins of the differences and the structural political, economic and cultural differences. For instanced there was less popular participation and enthusiasm for the wars (Ethiopia, and Spanish Civil War). In fact large portions of the population were very cynical; fascists and Mussolini were often regarded privately as ridiculous, including all the military swagger, although the idea of Italy becoming a more powerful, influential had appeal. Italy was a nation weak in resources while Nazi Germany possessed the material and human resources to make it potentially the most powerful state in Europe. Italian fascism was still also racist, in ethnocentric and cultural terms, as the use of chemical warfare against the Abyssinians in 1935 showed. It was not for a lack of want that the ‘fascistization’ was more insidious in Germany, than Italy. This had to do with restraints and differences external to its own ideology. The core of the ideology, its historical roots and its core political goals remained basically the same, despite the differences.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Nazi obsession with a racialism not only afflicted the German Nazis, but also several eastern European nationalist and fascist movements including those in Croatia, Slovakia, Serbia, Lithuania, Romania, Bulgaria, and the Ukraine. Anti-Jewish bigotry was rampant in all of these racialist movements, as was the idea of a link between Jewish financiers and Marxists.</p>
<p>I disagree that Rousseau can be said to be the father of Totalitarianism. In fact I disagree that totalitarianism is even possible in a strict sense, outside of works of fiction. Maybe approximations in some ways, best left understood in relative, rather than absolute terms. The Nazi state was massively authoritarian, but was less than ‘total’ in its control. The structuralists/functionalists (essentially a materialist) analysis of historians has largely replaced the more idealist [[[Great Man theory of history ]] outlook, and with some scholars even seeing Hitler as a comparatively weak dictator. While I don’t agree, I do think these methodological approach is more accurate and useful, instead of the almost cartoonish picture that absolute totalitarianism. Even Stalin’s totalitarianism in the Soviet Union was not absolute. I think its best left in fictional accounts of Oceania in 1984. character, although possessing totalitarian aspects.</p>
<p>The work on totalitarianism (Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, following that of Arendt), was was soon seen to be inadequate. There’s been a number of serious objections were raised to the applicability it’s criteria to any regimes, fascist or not. The term totalitarian proved to have even more considerable theoretical difficulty than fascist. And today Totalitarianism remains a vague and largely untestable hypothesis, hotly disputed and contested, much more so than fascism itself. To quote, ‘.. the very best that Friedrich and Brzezinski offered was a partial and primitive taxonomic scheme and some schematic accounts of some of the seemingly necessary and contingent conditions for the manifestations of some of the species, or subspecific, properties with which they were concerned… we neither know which traits of totalitarianism might be “essential” or “necessary,” nor can we argue with any confidence that the shared similarities between totalitarianisms mean anything “significant.” …. What we do not have is a general theory of Fascism (much less a general theory of totalitarianism). (A. J. Gregor, 1998, pp. 216-219 and 226-237).</p>
<p>But, this step backwards has not stopped a post-cold war resurgence of right wing Eastern European writing on the totalitarian theme – most of which remains as speculative and unproven as were its 1950s predecessors. Long ago Frederic J. Fleron Jr. remarked that it has become little more than negative label on a for a “bad”system of government’. - examples of which include Sparta, the Empire of Diocletian and Calvin’s Geneva. (cf. ‘Soviet Area Studies and the Social Sciences: Some Methodological Problems in Communist Studies’ Soviet Studies, 19/3: 1968, p. 313.) Arendt’s picture of totalitarianism was far too simplistic and she eventually concluded that her definition could not apply to the Soviet Union, which she ultimately referred to as a ‘one-party state’. Arguably the most devastating single attack on the totalitarian model of fascism came from Wolfgang Sauer’s article ‘National Socialism: Totalitarianism or Fascism?’ (American Historical Review, 73:2 December: 1967). In anycase 'Totalitarianism' not a clean’ scholarly concept, serving instead as an ideological instrument; its impossible to treat it as 'neutral' scholarly analytical tool. Notice that this doesnt have anything to do with favoring communism or Marxism. Its rejection is,though, related to an adoption of a materialist method that is shared by Marxism, which played a big role in developing the social sciences in this way, which informs to some degree the rejection of idealist, organic, theories of the state such as totalitarianism. But, suggesting that one is against the use of this concept because one is really a commie is a little silly. Red baiting is no longer in vougue.&#160;:)</p>
<p>Back Rousseau and the French Revolution. I say that it’s more accurate to think of it as one the fathers of all modern social theories; its progeny has thus been called Modernism. Indeed its the reaction to it gives us our modern ideologies. That is, the response to the French Revolution and Rousseau, by Hegel, Marx, and others, that poured into an intellectual stew that served us Marxism, socialism, national socialism, fascism, modern liberalism, modern conservatism, communism, depending on nature of the reaction. The democratic notions embodied in liberalism and Marxism was a positive reaction and development whereas fascism was a reaction against it in general and in particular against Marxism. This is what I meant.</p>
<p>"Fascism is reaction," said Mussolini, but reaction to what? The reactionary movement following World War I was based on a rejection of the social theories that formed the basis of the 1789 French Revolution, and whose early formulations in this country had a major influence on our Declaration of Independence, Constitution, and Bill of Rights. Fascists particularly loathed the social theories of the French Revolution and its slogan: "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity."</p>
<ul>
<li>Liberty from oppressive government intervention; the liberty to cast a vote in a system in which the majority ruled but the minority retained certain inalienable rights.</li>
<li>Equality in the sense of civic equality, egalitarianism, the notion that while people differ, they all should stand equal in the eyes of the law.</li>
<li>Fraternity in the sense of the brotherhood of mankind. That all women and men, the old and the young, the infirm and the healthy, the rich and the poor, share a spark of humanity that must be cherished on a level above that of the law, and this binds us all together.</li>
</ul>
<p>Benito Mussolini proclaimed, "Fascism, which was not afraid to call itself reactionary... does not hesitate to call itself illiberal and anti-liberal."</p>
<p>Modern historians of national culture and ideology like G. L. Mosse make this point, located fascism as part of a much longer European ‘revolt against reason’ and Enlightenment values characteristic of both Italian and German history.</p>
<p>The same point is made in Sternhell, "Modernity and Its Enemies: From the Revolt against the Enlightenment to the Undermining of Democracy," “The Enlightenment was the age of criticism....The principal ideas of the modern age--progress, revolution, liberty, democracy--ensued from criticism. It was the rational criticism of certitudes and traditional values--and in the first place religion--which produced the theory of the rights of man, the primacy of the individual with regard to society....It was the rational criticism of the existing order which allowed society to be conceived as an aggregate of individuals and the state as an instrument in the hands of the individual. The Intellectual Revolt against Liberal Democracy, 1870-1945, ad. Zeev Sternhell (Jerusalem: Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities, 1996), 12.</p>
<p>"Fascist Romanticism is hatred of the modern world and nostalgia for an organic community of the past…” A prime example is the German Nazis' longing for "the old tribal and feudal Germany, for traditional peasant life in opposition to the big city, it assert that the German Nazi vilification "of the modern world and nostalgia for an organic community of the past" is typically fascist. See ibid., 56-57, 60-63, 69-72.</p>
<p>Also See Eric Hobsbawm, Nations and Nationalism since 1780: Program, Myth, Reality (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990); and H. Stuart Hughes, Consciousness and Society: The Reorientation of European Social Thought, 1890-1930 (New York: Vintage Books, 1958) About the birth of democracy in the wake of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution of 1789, and the subsequent globalization of capitalism, that supports my claims.</p>
<p>“Scholars now recognize the role of fascism in the emergence of anti-Enlightenment movements opposed to the democratic tradition that was the heritage of Enlightenment thought. Indeed, the rise of fascism in Europe responded to a widespread search for spiritual values and "organic" institutions capable of counteracting what was considered the corrosive effects of rationalism (and capitalism) on the body politic. As Pierre Birnbaum notes, democracy's opponents repudiated the Enlightenment principle of a rationalism inherent in human nature and the legitimizing principle of "one man, one vote." In its stead they posited ethnic, regional, and religious forms of national identity, antithetical to political democracy's universalist and rationalist precepts. See Pierre Birnbaum, "Catholic Identity, Universal Suffrage and 'Doctrines of Hatred,'" in The Intellectual Revolt against Liberal Democracy, 1870-1945, ad. Zeev Sternhell (Jerusalem: Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities, 1996), 233-51.</p>
<p>Fascists, though opposed to Enlightenment ideals were eager to absorb those aspects of modernity that could be reconfigured within their antirational concept of national identity. Thus, historian Jeffrey Herf has documented the Nazis' thorough acceptance of modern industrialism, which has led him to coin the term "reactionary modernism" to describe those thinkers and ideologues under the Weimer Republic and the Third Reich "who rejected liberal democracy and the legacy of the Enlightenment, yet simultaneously embraced the modern technology of the second industrial revolution." See Jeffrey Herf, "Reactionary Modernism Reconsidered: Modernity, the West and the Nazis," in Sternhell (as in n. 8), 131-58; and idem, Reactionary Modernism: Technology, Culture, and Politics in Weimar and the Third Reich (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984). Herf's book considers the simultaneous championing of "volkish ideology," "romantic irrationalist ideas," and "modern technology" on the part of such thinkers as Oswald Spengler, Ernst Junger, and Carl Schmitt, Nazi ideologues Goebbels and Hitler.</p>
<p>To contravene this new social and political order, the Enlightenment's critics turned to alternative philosophical strands, from which they constructed new social systems attuned to the Industrial Revolution yet opposed to the democratic tradition. Antirationalist philosophers and activists such as Maurice Barres, Georges Sorel, and Henri Bergson, antidemocratic sociologists like Gustave Le Bon and Vilfredo Pareto, and racial theorists like Arthur de Gobineau inspired the anti-Semitic blood and soil politics of the Nazis, the creation of fascist myths under Mussolini, the socioeconomics of corporatism, and the theatrical mass politics of fascist regimes and movements throughout Europe. Moreover, concepts and myths were created to reflect regeneration, spiritualism, and primitivism, integrated into the anti-Enlightenment pantheon of fascist values. Over the course of the 1990s historians of fascism began probing this cultural matrix.</p>
<p>By claiming that fascism possessed a "mythic core" Griffin highlights the irrationalism behind fascist ideology and the function of myths as motivating factors among fascism's adherents. He turns to the theory of myth propounded by French political theorist Georges Sorel (1847-1922) to define the fascists' specialized use of this concept--an appropriate association, given Mussolini's self-professed debt to the author of <i>Reflections on Violence</i> (1908). Sorel concluded that the revolutionary transformations instigated by religious sects and political movements arise from the emotive impact of their core myths, defined as those visionary principles that inspire immediate action. For Sorel, myths were decidedly instrumental; rather than providing people with a social blueprint for a future to be created incrementally through political reform and rational planning, myths presented the public with a visionary ideal whose stark contrast with present reality would agitate the masses. In his Reflections on V iolence, Sorel underscored the emotive and antirational nature of myth by defining it as "a body of images capable of evoking all the sentiments which correspond to the different manifestations of the War undertaken by socialism against modern society." Nazi ideology was to supply values that would facilitate the nation's rebirth, pointing out that "the Nazis no more wanted to return Germany to the period of the Volkswanderugen (tribal migrations) or the Holy Roman Empire than the [Italian] fascists wanted to return literally to the age of the Romans or the Renaissance." See Roger Griffin, The Nature of Fascism (London: Pinter, 1991; reprint, London: Routledge, 1993), See Jeffrey Herf, "Reactionary Modernism Reconsidered: Modernity, the West and the Nazis," in Sternhell, 131-58; and idem, Reactionary Modernism: Technology, Culture, and Politics in Weimar and the Third Reich (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984). Herf's book considers the simultaneous championing of "volkish ideology," "romantic irrationalist ideas," and "modern technology" on the part of such thinkers as Oswald Spengler, Ernst Junger, and Carl Schmitt, Nazi ideologues Goebbels and Hitler. In Herf's words, "The reactionary modernists were German nationalists who turned the revolt against materialism away from backward-looking pastoralism.... They saw in technology a thing of beauty, a product of German creativity rather than of Jewish commercialism and internationalism." (Herf [as in n. 8], 134). Central is the idea "of the myth of renewal" to this "alternative" modernism in fascist ideology. See Roger Griffin, The Nature of Fascism (London: Pinter, 1991; reprint, London: Routledge, 1993), 47 (page references are to the reprint). Jaskot's book is indicative o f a new trend in fascist studies that focuses on the competition among various Nazi organizations for economic and cultural hegemony under the Third Reich</p>
<p>Griffin also sees racist eugenics as an aspect of its palingenetic or regenerative ultranationalist orientation. "Espousing "blood and soil" tribalism even as it constructed autobahns, engineered the Volkswagen, and developed advanced methods of factory organization, the Nazi regime--like its Italian counterpart and fascist movements in France--looked to both a mythic past and a technological future in a manner that seems highly contradictory." Fascism is a genus of political ideology whose mythic core in its various permutations is a palingenetic form of populist ultra-nationalism. (p. 26)".</p>
<p>So, we see that the volkish aspect of Fascism are just the paricular varient expression that took form in Nazism. The key here is that fascism is simply the most virulent form of right-wing populism. Not all right-wing populist groups are fascist, but all Fascist groups use right-wing populist rhetoric. They work together in a complex dynamic of demonization and scapegoating leading to ethnocentric repression that often accompanies right-wing populist movements.</p>
<p>Volkish thinkers are one part of this in Nazi Germany. They embraced all things German—the medieval past, the German landscape, the simple peasant, the village— and denounced the humanist tradition as alien to the German soul.</p>
<p>Volkish thinkers abhorred almost everything about modern society—industrialization, urbanization, materialism, party politics, and class conflicts. Capitalism, impersonal and rationalized, destroyed ancient social forms and virtues and alienated people from themselves and each other. Liberalism fostered materialism, individualism and a rational-scientific outlook all of which separated Germans from the true genius, the peculiar character, the soul of the German nation.</p>
<p>The peasant, in close touch with the soil, was believed to be most in touch with this German soul. Urbanization was breaking this link with the soil and thus was a grave danger to the future of the German nation. Germans who lived in cities were urged to return as often and as much as possible to rural areas to get in touch with this real source of German identity and distinctiveness. The idea of lebensraum and the settlement of German farmers in the east, which was picked up and amplified by the Nazis, were based upon this idea of returning as many Germans as possible to agriculture and the connection with the land.</p>
<p>Volkish thinkers yearned to restore the sense of community that they believed existed before industrialization. Only by identifying with their sacred soil and sacred traditions would Germans escape from the rootlessness and alienation of modern industrial society. A return to roots would restore authenticity to life and stimulate creativity. Only then could the different classes band together in an ‘organic’ unity.</p>
<p>Volkish thinkers were strongly attracted to racist doctrines which held that race was the key history. A race retained its vigor and achieved greatness when it maintained its purity; intermarriage was a contamination that resulted in genetic, cultural and military decline. Volkish thinkers claimed that the ‘German race’ was purer than, and therefore superior to, all other races. They claimed that the Germans were descendants of ancient Aryans, the only descendants who had maintained their purity.</p>
<p>This is where racism naturally ties it Imperialism (which btw, is an essential part of the totalitarian model, so its odd that on one hand those that support the Totalitarian label reject describing it as imperialism (Arendt would disagree). Also, anti-Semitism was a very prominent feature of Volkish thought. Some Volkish thinkers wanted a German religion, different from Christianity. Others wanted to harmonize Christianity with ancient Germanic traditions; this was linked with a determination to expunge ‘Jewish’ elements from Christianity.</p>
<p>I think it might help if you if you realize that Fascist ideas constituted a vague ideology rather than, i.e. Marxist-Leninism, an intellectual coherent dialectic. Thus, we are dealing here, not with a precise ideology, but with the loosely formulated aspirations and inchoate impulses, which motivated the fascist movements, but whose elements can be grasps sufficiently for identification.</p>
<p>It’s no accident that Fascism in all its variants (Nazism) display anti-modernism or of social pathological processes in the paths of development it followed. Its raw materials were the forces of militarism, racism, chauvinism, charismatic leadership, populist nationalism, fears that the nation or civilization as a whole was being undermined by the forces of decadence, deep anxiety about the modern age and longings for a new era to begin---all these active ingredients are made possible in contemporary history, forged together into popular, and even mass movements in the inter-war period for both fascism and nazism, and allowed them to eventually to erect a new type of single party state, as a conjuncture of acute socio-political tensions resulting directly or indirectly from the First World War and the Russian Revolution.</p>
<p>To sum up, since the 1960’s the case was strongly made that fascism was in fact a genuine ideology, with its origins and the intellectual revolt against liberalism, rationalism, industrialization and urbanization of the nineteenth century, followed by communism and democracy in the twentieth. Beginning with Ernst Nolte’s ‘resistance to transcendence’ definition, a range of ideologically defined generic models was constructed insisting that fascism can be core defined in terms of its ideas and beliefs. [Nolte, 1966; Gregor, 1969.] The 1970s and ‘80s a number of liberal historians (Renzo De Felice (later moved right), Zeev Sternhell, George L. Mosse, and Stanley Payne) followed up this ideological and historical line of enquiry and established as an accepted fact that generic fascism could be defined, at least in part, through its shared core beliefs. By the early 1990s a second generation of liberal idealist scholars were building upon these earlier works with Roger Griffin’s The Nature of Fascism published in 1991, followed by Roger Eatwell’s article: ‘Towards and new Model of Generic Fascism.’ in 1992.</p>
<p>Thus, Fascism and Nazism, despite their differences, can be viewed as alternative forms of fascist route to modernization. Both were attempts to escape from a perceived spiritual and material crisis in Italy and Germany, with the creation of a new society. Italian Fascism had always been imbued with the modernization myth. Nazi Germany's "reactionary modernism" likewise reflected in Hitler’s Table Talk of nazi’s eventual desire to turn back the clock, in a de-urbanized society. <a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 20:15, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Gio, I have not yet read all of your post (but I will in time). Just a few remarks on points you raised.</p>
<ul>
<li>I think you are right that there were external factors that limited Fascism as well (notably the existence of a King and the, well, nonchalant attitude of Italians towards laws - as opposed to German efficency - agreed these are clichees, but they have their kernels of truth and you know what I mean), but there were also internal factors involved. You cannot lay the huge difference between people killed by Mussolini 1922-43 and Hitler 1933-45 at the doorstep of external limits.</li>
<li>You are giving a good outline of the F vs. T debate - only I disagree with you on the merit of the concept of T. I think both (small case) fascism and Totalitarianism are valid constructs/models (and as not such not real vs. Fascism or Nazism or Communism) that try to elucidate Nazism, both try and both are valid but appearently we disagree on which model is better in doing the job.</li>
<li>Saying that T. cannot be achieved in reality is beside the point - the intent of the regimes is what counts - the human factor will always work against perfection, be it good or bad.</li>
<li>I agree that the French Revolution is the source of all political ideologies (with the exception of the reactionaries, by which I mean the actual reactionaries of the early 19th century that never had much real impact) - they relate to the FR by affirming some and opposing some (either for being too little or too much). When Mussolini declared F. to be reactionary he was using a term already tainted by polemics - he didn't try to restore the conditions of 1788 (on the contrary, being a Nationalist) and "futurism" was one of the three root movements of Italian Fascism.</li>
<li>I must insist on my characterisation of Rousseau - wasn't it he who theorized about the Volonté Generale that he defined a priori and which must be implement even against any opposition. This was the ideology on which Robespierre and Saint Just based their terreur, this was the root of Marxist ideology and of all the atrocities of the Communist world.</li>
<li>You are right that actual Fascism is somewhat opposed to ideology ("Our ideology is the act!"), but that isn't true in the case of Nazism, though it is not as easy to find Nazism's actual ideology as the leaders were spinning sometimes conflicting threads - but in the end Hitler is definitive and he is ideologically coherent.</li>
<li>I also must disagree with you on the racist character of Fascism. No doubt, Fascists "looked down on the negro" but that doesn't make them any more racist than many Western democratic leaders/societies. However, you won't find any attempts by Italy to exterminate the "racially inferior Abyssianians". The usage of gas is also irrelevant in that respect - Germans and Entente used gas on each other in World War I - does that mean there were racist against each other?</li>

<dl>
<dd>The article intro makes Hitler sound like some sort of misunderstood, wayward hero who rescued Germany and led it forward, just as the Nazis used to portray him.</dd>
</dl>
<p>While I thoroughly believe that he has made this statement in total good faith and utter sincerity, I do not agree with <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">User:Simonides</a>. The Holocaust/genocide sentence, along with reference to his having led Germany to utter defeat starkly shows that this was, in polite terms, one of the most disastrous leaders in history. <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">User:Simonides</a> says he has been editing on WP for about a month. I wish he had expressed this stark (and valid) opinion on this page earlier. If he did, I apologize for not seeing it.</p>
<p>It don't think it is encyclopedic or helpful for the intro to make any particular effort in expressing the supportable and reasonable opinion that AH was one of the purest, documented historical examples of evil available (which I happen to agree with). The intro is not an opportunity for op-ed. Let the reader decide: Readers who can't infer a similar opinion from the whole artilce's text as it now stands won't be swayed by an intro anyway.</p>
<p><a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">User:Simonides</a> also "accused" me of thinking AH was "talented and brilliant." I do. One of the starkest lessons of history may be found in the tale of Mr Hitler, that we are led both to meed and to ruin by the most talented and brilliant among us and that all that glitters is not gold. AH was not a cartoon caracature of evil to the tens of millions who supported him during the 1930s, who learned only when it was too late that in addition to being talented and brilliant, he was a raving lunatic. Even Madga Goebbels was expressing doubts along these lines by 1943. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 20:50, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"evil" is in itself a POV; I personally don't believe in "evil" nor agree that Hitler was a good example of such. The crimes committed by the Third Reich were notable for the banality of the men committing them. The picture of Hitler as the carpet-chewing drooler is appropriate for Punch magazine but not an encyclopedia. Dismissing him as a mere lunatic or madman is a disservice I think t those that followed him, those that fought against him, and those that were victimized and died at his command.<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Dorosh_6aa0.html" title="User:Michael Dorosh">Michael Dorosh</a> 21:56, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think it much matters what we think of Mr. Hitler. I don't think it really mattered that much in the course of history, either, which means I'm not in the intentionalist camp. We need only note the fascist nature of the Nazi Regime, mention its particularities, the history, and the role played by its dictator, however lazy he was himself to do much of the actual dictating. I happen to think that all imperialism, and all fascism is evil, as in immoral, a violation of ethical principals. This imperialist regime under the form of fascism just carried out its class violence and racism in a more concentrated, open and terroristic manner characteristic of fascism--but not essentiallly different in nature than what all the other imperialists did and still do, and that includes US imperialism as well as the classic the British Empire whose sun never set, etc. Its all "evil" and not primarily based on the individual historical actors. <a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 22:12, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I know you would disagree. We disagree. And, no, it's very helpful when we make the systmatic connection of unjust state power, looking at the driving political and econoimic forces for system of oppression despite their form. Very helpful. Imperialism need not be fuzzy at all if we cofine ourselves with a particular school of thought within imperialist theories. And, I can show historical continuity and accuracy for such a POV. Just to quote Noam Chomsky, on the US supported genocide of East Timor where almost one-third of the Timorese population was wiped out: <i>"The greatest genocide relative to population since the Holocaust, and supported by the US."</i> I'd call that a comprable evil. Like I said you don't have to be a fascist to be an imperialist, although all fascists are imperialists. The millions that US imperialism killed in Vietnam is also pretty evil, and some of it was very Nazi-like, in practice. <a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 22:50, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I absolutely cannot see where this article portrays Hitler as a hero. There were certain pitfalls and much of the discussion has been on avoiding these pitfalls.</p>
<p>I disagree with Michael (and Hannah Ahrendt) that the evil of the Nazi regime was banal. I believe she was blinded by Eichmann's defense strategy who claimed that he was only obeying orders. Other utterances of him however make it clear that he knew and liked what he was doing, namely killing Jews. The evils of Nazism were banal only to the extent that any evil is banal as it violates moral principles open to any ordinary human being (and not just to hypertrained ethicist, these are sometimes the worst offenders themselves). One of these is "Thou shalt no murder!"</p>
<p>I also disagree on "Imperialism" - I agree that it is potentially useful, but as there are reasons against using it and als alternative wordings, I prefer these alternatives. No, it is not useful to try to equate totally different things (though both might still be bad): the US is not Nazi Germany, even when taken a toleration of the Timor genocide into account. Citing Chomsky doesn't make it any better. He might be a great linguist (Ann should comment on this), but his political views are plainly misguided. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 23:19, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd expect you to disagree with me and the great political thinker, <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noam_Chomsky_7341.html" title="Noam Chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a>. I disagree about imperialism, though, and I still plan on dealing with that subject in depth. Btw, it was not toleration, it was active support, both militarily, violating the arms embargo(as they were running out of bullets), and politically, to quote Chomksy: <i>"Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan -- who was, at that time, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. In his memoirs, he says, the U.S. "wished things to turn out as they did and worked to bring this about. The Department of State desired that the" UN "prove utterly ineffective in whatever measures it" might undertake. "This task was given to me, and I carried it" out "with no inconsiderable success." He also knew how things turned out. He goes on to say that, in the next couple of weeks, about 60,000 people were killed -- the same proportion, he says, as the number of people killed by the Nazis on the eastern front. And -- having proudly compared himself to the Nazis -- he then goes on to some other topic.</i><a href="http://www.zmag.org/chomsky/talks/9512-timor-etan.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.zmag.org/chomsky/talks/9512-timor-etan.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 23:22, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As far as Timor goes. I don't know the exact facts and so I can't comment on it. Only this much: I think you would agree that murdering Timorians was not the supreme objective of US policy. That doesn't make those guilty any less guilty, but still it is a difference. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 23:52, 19 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Its a distinction without a moral difference. My point has only been that other imperialist can be just as evil, even democratic ones, as fascist imperialsts are--that imperialism is just as moraly repugnant. Lets consider a provacative point using "mens rea" analysis of criminal law here. According to Michael Tonry, Professor of Law at the University of Minnesota, "In the criminal law, purpose and knowledge are equally culpable states of mind. An action taken with a purpose to kill is no more culpable than an action taken with some other purpose in mind but with knowledge that a death will probably result. Blowing up an airplane to kill a passenger is equivalent to blowing up an airplane to destroy a fake painting and thereby to defraud an insurance company, knowing that the passenger will be killed. Both are murder. Most people would find the latter killing more despicable."

<dd>Legal definition. If it violates international law, but not your own nations law, is the killing still not murder, even if its unjust killing? Even if the orders are illegal? The Nuremburgh trial I think settled this point by merely following orders doesnt excuse culpability.

<dd>This brings up Kholberg's 4th level of moral development... <i>I was only following orders.</i> There are those who say (and with some basis) that most of the Wehrmacht officers sentenced at Nuremberg shouldn't have been, while responsibility for horrors done in the camps is more tangled. Hitler, Bormann and Himmler, for example, could have been legally prosecuted and sentenced under international law for the industrial genocide of civilians. They knew what was coming one way or another and each killed himself when hope of personal escape evaporated. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 23:42, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Michael,</dd>
<dd>a soldier killing in war according to the accepted rules of war (a deficent but necessary crutch) is not a murderer, <b>BUT</b> Eichmann didn't kill in the war (but sent Jews to death factories), Himmler was no soldier until July 1944. And order like the Kommissarbefehl were illegal, as Gio says, according to the accepted rules of war and according to the Wehrmacht's code and there were officers that refused to implement it because of this. Being a soldier doesn't exclude the possibility of murder, as Gio says. Some killings in war are not murder, but other killings are murder even in war. It is the latter category Nazi Germany is rightly beloathed for, not the former. And Nuremberg (though only directed at the losing side) did make that clear.</dd>
<dd>Ah, and Eichmann was not "just doing his duty as a soldier". He said that in his trial to improve his position. But in an interview, secretly taped, he bragged about killing Jews and did not hide his anti-Semitic motives.</dd>
<dd>As for conflicting legal spheres. See Natural law (which doesn't change) and rules of war (which are somewhat subject to change - but they did not change at some time between, say, 1920 and 1945).</dd>

<dd>You honestly don't "get" that evil is a POV? I mean, really? And you don't understand that the whole idea of labelling Hitler as "evil" is a POV issue? If Hitler, Eichmann and the thousands, perhaps millions, of "good Germans" who willingly participated in the industrial slaughter of 11 million people didn't see themselves as "evil", what point is there in our labelling them as such? It only serves to lessen the impact of what they did, as we can simply ascribe it to mental illness or some other reason that invites incredulity.

<dd>There's that tale about Goering while on trial at Nuremberg and one day he was in the prison courtyard walking about with other defendants and Jews were mentioned in the course of a conversation. A guard overheard him say (I'm paraphrasing, sorry), "Jews? I thought we killed them all!" The clear implication being there was, under the law, no military justification. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 00:03, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sigh. Half my time on WP is spent refuting strawmen because some people either can't or won't read or enjoy disingenuousness for the sake of it. A whole section discussing bollocks! How sadly symptomatic.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>First, to correct Wyss, I linked to and discussed this paragraph, which of course she doesn't understand or doesn't mention:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><i>Under Hitler's <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charismatic_authority.html" title="Charismatic authority">charismatic</a> <a href="../../../l/e/a/Leadership.html" title="Leadership">leadership</a> Germany emerged from the depths of defeat to rebuild its <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economy.html" title="Economy">economy</a> and its decimated <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military.html" title="Military">military</a>. At the height of their power during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, the armies of <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_Germany_add9.html" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> and its <a href="../../../a/x/i/Axis_Powers_169f.html" title="Axis Powers">allies</a> dominated much of <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>.</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Second, I started by saying <i>This was my first edit, less than one month ago, to the article on Hitler.</i> Not <i>This was my first edit on Wikipedia</i>. I first came to WP over a year and a half ago but quit for several months, but that's irrelevant - even if I was here just a month ago it is no indication of credibility, given that some long-time editors here are simply clueless.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Third, it appears Wyss is engaging in <a href="../../../h/a/r/Wikipedia%7EHarassment_9843.html" title="Wikipedia:Harassment">Wikistalking</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Fourth, the POV that I discussed with Gio33 becomes more evident everyday, now that Str1977 makes his opinion of Chomsky clear. (Not that Chomsky is a political <i>thinker</i> - but he is one of the few important <i>activists</i> with scholarly authority.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Fifth, there is no affirmative, scholarly documentation to prove that Hitler was either extraordinarily talented or brilliant. This is purely subjective opinion that some scholars differ on, but regardless of consensus, it remains a matter of interpretation. It's a clear example of a 'point of view'.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, I personally never brought up or mentioned the word <i>evil</i> - the word does not mean a lot to me. However, I've read enough or watched enough memoirs of the Holocaust/WW2 and of Stalinism to at least vaguely grasp the scale and the great many nuances of what victims of either went through, compared to which the aleatoric debates on 'lack of good' and 'law vs responsibility' are mere shuffling of feet, the silliness of naive children trying to make sense of adult things. There are many problems with the approach to the article, but a key one is that some people here are so wound up on <i>understanding the Nazis</i> that they fail to see anything else, as if <i>understanding American Republicans</i> - merely a bunch of idiots or ignoramuses, most of them amoral, manipulative and greedy people with no insight into or empathy for anything - gives us any profound truths about humanity or the crime of the Iraqi invasion. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 06:05, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Simonides &amp; Wyss, could you please stop this bickering. Simonides, Chomsky might be a great linguist but he has no more authority to base his political utterances on than you or me or Wyss or Gio or whoever. Interpretation gets cited all the way in WP - if scholars agree on this it wouldn't be POV (Not to say that it isn't). And IMHO it is safe to say that Hitler had some talents and made use of them. We needn't include "evil" into the article (and I am not sure who suggested that) - let's report the facts and any human being in his right mind will come to the conclusion by himself. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 08:37, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My points were not addressed only to Wyss.</dd>
<dd>Chomsky has plenty of authority based on the several books he has written, none of which reflect shoddy scholarship, something Chomsky knows a great deal about, although many people may differ with him on matters of interpretation. As an activist, he certainly has much more authority than anyone on this page, and to claim otherwise is just silly.</dd>
<dd>What does it mean to say Hitler 'was talented'? Every other employee of a local mafia is 'talented' in much the same way, ie in thuggery, deception, self-conviction, manipulation, self-promotion, apathy towards basic human rights, the value of a human life, etc, which is not very different from many politicians, of course. If that's what you mean (ie base resourcefulness), then yes, he was 'talented.' -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 06:22, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The point is that 1) you misquoted me and after my clarification continue to misrepresent my comments, intentionally or not; 2) your idea of NPOV has little to do with objectivity and more to do with a sort of kindergarten philosophy where fairness means giving every point of view, even unfounded ones, equal representation - after all <i>everyone has a token amount of good in them</i>!

<dd>I don't think the intro makes Hitler out to be a hero either (quite the contrary). Since these discussions have become a bit convoluted and extended (which is normal) I suppose I should make it clear that I have never, ever supported the use of the term <i>evil</i> in the AH article, don't even use the term myself and would work hard to remove it if it ever showed up there. The term is ultimately PoV and utterly undescriptive in any scholarly context. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 23:26, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">hitler's death</span></h2>
<p>no one knows for sure what happened to hitler in the end. The current version only includes 1 theory:</p>
<p>"Hitler committed suicide in the Führerbunker on April 30, 1945 by means of a self-delivered shot to the head (it is likely he simultaneously bit into a cyanide ampoule). Hitler's body and that of Eva Braun (his long-term mistress whom he had married the day before) were put in a bomb crater, partially burned with petrol by Führerbunker aides and hastily buried in the Chancellory garden as Russian shells poured down and Red Army infantry continued to advance only two or three hundred metres away.</p>
<p>When Russian forces reached the Chancellory they found his body and an autopsy was performed using dental records (and German dental assistants who were familiar with them) to confirm the identification. To avoid any possibility of creating a potential shrine the remains of Hitler and Braun were repeatedly moved, then secretly buried by SMERSH at their new headquarters in Magdeburg. In April 1970, when the facility was about to be turned over to the East German government, the remains were reportedly exhumed, thoroughly cremated, and the ashes finally dumped unceremoniously into the Elbe."</p>
<p>I think it should be changed to something like: "There are many theories as to what happened to hitler next. though some believe he escaped most people agree that hitler committed suicide in the bunker (along with Eva Braun). his body was burnt by the soviets so as not to create a shrine for neo-nazis)."</p>

<dd>The recommendation was specifically that he "study" architecture. As I recall, their recommendation was made in the context that he might be capable of being an architectural draftsman.

As we know, he never enrolled in any school after his rejection by the academy and within about a year had drifted into homelessness, finally asking for assistance from a homeless shelter which ironically was financed by a Jewish philanthropist. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 18:46, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>None of Hitler's paintings should be included in the article.

<p>In memory of the tens of millions who died as a direct result of this <i>evil</i> barbarian, move the pictures to Wiki commons, or delete them.</p>
<p>Also, Hitler's regime didn't "collapse" - it was ground into the dust, utterly <i>destroyed</i>, mostly by his "racial inferiors". <a href="../../../c/p/m/User%7ECPMcE_3017.html" title="User:CPMcE"><i>Camillus</i></a> <a href="../../../c/p/m/User_talk%7ECPMcE_6ecc.html" title="User talk:CPMcE">(talk)</a> 11:15, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This articleis a biography of Adolph Hitler. His art "career" was played a major part in his early life and was part of the course that led him to where he ended up. It is necessary to include it. Not to include it would violate NPOV (because you are focusing on just 1 aspect of his life). The pictures are necessary to shows us what Hitler's art was like and to allow us to make up our own minds as to weather Hitler had artisic talent or not.</dd>

<dd>It goes to his character and the notion that there is no such thing as "complete evil". Hitler demonstrated artistic ability and his perception of himself as an artist had a great effect on how he lived his life, the relationships he maintained (ie he viewed Speer as a "fellow artist"). What point would there be in having an article that said "Hitler was bad, he killed 11 million people and started a World War. The End."?

<p>The pictures of paintings are essential in giving as much info as possible in such a small document. Collapsed is a rather weak term for the state of Germany at the end of the war, and I'm not convinced having two large armies invade your country is particularly an internal process. Destroyed is too harsh and not entirely accurate (eg: The Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag are still standing and several million Germans from the time survived.), It could do with something more accurate. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilipPage_055f.html" title="User:PhilipPage">PhilipPage</a> 23:49, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Vegetarianism"</span></h2>
<p>I was a tad disappointed to see this figure classified under "vegetarians." The man was known to promote the diet, but often consumed a plethora of meats, including pork and game. Request this category be removed. --AWF</p>
<p>With all due respect, the historical record does not support your assertion, although some fringe vegetarian publications do make these wholly unsupported claims, wontedly by applying references to his diet in the 1920s to what he ate after 1932. By the standards of the time, AH was a practicing vegetarian from the early 1930s until his death. He avoided eating meat and by the early 1940s at the latest was abstaining altogether aside from animal products which may have now and then been slipped into his meals and medicines without his knowledge. Readers are strongly cautioned not to conflate vegetarianism with an ethical life, although I realize some enthusiastic vegetarians struggle with the notion these are separate things. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 22:34, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>I beg to differ. The record does support AWF's assertion. Also, Vegetarianism is motivated by ethics as much as it is by health or other concerns (environmental). Its clear the Hitler's alleged vegetarianism is not driven by ethical concerns but a result of a doctors recommendation for health problems and his fear of contracting cancer. Ones practices, including dietary practices, are an important part of ones ethical life. But, we must also look at the motivations for these actions. Even, so Hitler still ate meat.</dd>
<dd>As I said Hitler's doctors put him on a vegetarian diet for a chronic stomach disorder, his biographers such as Albert Speer, Robert Payne, John Toland, and others, have attested to his liking for ham sausages and other cured meats. We have the testimony of the woman chef who was his personal cook in Hamburg during the late 1930s - Dione Lucas. In her "Gourmet Cooking School Cookbook," she records that his favorite dish - the one that he customarily requested - was stuffed squab (pigeon). "I do not mean to spoil your appetite for stuffed squab, but you might be interested to know that it was a great favorite with Mr. Hitler, who dined in the hotel often." – From a review by Rynn Berry that appeared in the Summer 1995 issue of Vegetarian Voice. New York Times posts a correction – Hitler “did eat at least some meat.” – From a Jewish Vegetarians of North America news release. <a href="http://jewishveg.com/media12.html" class="external free" title="http://jewishveg.com/media12.html" rel="nofollow">http://jewishveg.com/media12.html</a> The link includes more information about Hitler's meat eating and the fact that the Nazis banned vegetarian organizations in Germany and the lands they invaded and occupied.</dd>
<dd>The March 15, 2005 New York Times "Corrections" box included the following important item on page two: "A film review about 'Downfall,' which looks at Hitler's final days, referred incorrectly to his diet. Although the movie portrays him as vegetarian, he did eat at least some meat.” While it is true that Hitler's doctors put him on a vegetarian diet to cure him of flatulence and a chronic stomach disorder, his biographers such as Albert Speer, Robert Payne, John Toland, and others, have attested to his liking for ham sausages and other cured meats. Even Spencer says that Hitler was a vegetarian from only 1931 on: "It would be true to say that up to 1931, he preferred a vegetarian diet, but on some occasions would deviate from it." He committed suicide in the bunker when he was 56 in 1945; that would have given him 14 years as a vegetarian, but we have the testimony to the contrary of the woman chef who was his personal cook in Hamburg during the late 1930s - Dione Lucas. In her "Gourmet Cooking School Cookbook," she records that his favorite dish - the one that he customarily requested - was stuffed squab (pigeon). "I do not mean to spoil your appetite for stuffed squab, but you might be interested to know that it was a great favorite with Mr. Hitler, who dined in the hotel often." – From a review by Rynn Berry that appeared in the Summer 1995 issue of Vegetarian Voice. <a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 18:42, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Answer</b>: Because a large amount of people were killed as a direct result of Hitler's ideology, command, and actions. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinuxbeak_c86a.html" title="User:Linuxbeak">Linuxbeak</a> (drop me a <a href="../../../l/i/n/User_talk%7ELinuxbeak_c40b.html" title="User talk:Linuxbeak">line</a>) 20:14, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>But a large amount of people were killed as a direct result of George Bush ideology and actions (or almost every US president)...

<li>That is an invalid arguement. The statement that George Bush is responsible for the deaths of x amount of people is disputable, or at the very least incomplete. George Bush did not overtly order any large-scale troop movement anywhere until after the September 11th attacks. Therefore, you would have to argue seperate points to get to that final point that George Bush is directly responsible for the deaths of many people. Additionally:
<ul>
<li>While Bush is [weakly] arguably responsible for some thousands of deaths, Hitler is unarguably responsible for several millions of deaths.</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_on_Terrorism_c7b1.html" title="War on Terrorism">War on Terrorism</a> is not easily argued to be stared by either side (Americans or terrorist groups). Hitler's campaign of expansion was unarguably a German-sparked conflict.</li>
<li>George Bush is not waging a campaign of genocide, as Hitler was. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinuxbeak_c86a.html" title="User:Linuxbeak">Linuxbeak</a> (drop me a <a href="../../../l/i/n/User_talk%7ELinuxbeak_c40b.html" title="User talk:Linuxbeak">line</a>) 20:28, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

But genocide on an industrial scale is profoundly noteworthy. Being a casualty of warfare is something different from being murdered by your own government for stupid reasons. The problem is that Hitler caused so many deaths directly or indirectly that it's hard to sort out all the numbers.</li>

<dd>Well that and being consistent. The Japanese Empire was as brutal as the Third Reich but there's no opening paragraph mention of it on the Empire of Japan entry <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_empire" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_empire" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_empire</a>, nor on any of the related Japanese Prime Minister pages nor in the opening of the Hirohito page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showa_Emperor" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showa_Emperor" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showa_Emperor</a>.

The Germans killed six million Jews and 20 million Russians [i.e. Soviet citizens]; the Japanese slaughtered as many as 30 million Filipinos, Malays, Vietnamese, Cambodians, Indonesians and Burmese, at least 23 million of them ethnic Chinese. Both nations looted the countries they conquered on a monumental scale, though Japan plundered more, over a longer period, than the Nazis. Both conquerors enslaved millions and exploited them as forced labourers — and, in the case of the Japanese, as [forced] prostitutes for front-line troops. If you were a Nazi prisoner of war from Britain, America, Australia, New Zealand or Canada (but not Russia) you faced a 4 % chance of not surviving the war; [by comparison] the death rate for Allied POWs held by the Japanese was nearly 30 %." <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilipPage_055f.html" title="User:PhilipPage">PhilipPage</a> 23:48, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is there a name for the type of moustache that Hitler sported?

<p>who cares about nuetrality??? No one wants to listen to anyone who says that Hitler was good. Wikipedia has facts right? Fact: Hitler=Evil He doesnt deserve nuetrality. unsigned by 68.116.187.228</p>
<p>Wikipedia is about neutrality, for one. Without neutrality, history becomes skewed and incorrect. Wikipedia strives for the truth in all matters.</p>
<p>Secondly, your opinion on Hitler may not be the same as another's opinion on Hitler. Just because you hate him, doesn't mean another person doesn't love him.Burnthetown 08:51, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's not a matter of wheather he 'deserves' neutrality or not. Every article in WP gets neutrality no matter what the writer's opinion is. It's an encyclopedia.

<dd>You didn't lead a nation to taking over Europe and nearly beating all world powers. Famous people have their hobbies in their biographies, and Hitler is arguably the most famous individual in history. He wasn't a great painter, but it is still important that he was interested in painting. That being said, I have yet to find anything on his ballroom dancing. Burnthetown 19:55, 9 March 2006 (UTC)
