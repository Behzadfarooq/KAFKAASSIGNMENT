<p>Is there any need for the <a href="../../../m/u/d/Mudbrick.html" title="Mudbrick">mudbrick</a> article? I suppose it can just redirect to this article. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChina_Crisis_8a30.html" title="User:China Crisis">China Crisis</a> 20:52, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Mudbrick is described as having a very short lifespan, 30 years and generally is poor. Adobe is described as being much more effective. I think it must be the formula that makes the difference. <a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotusduck_82e8.html" title="User:Lotusduck">Lotusduck</a> 01:42, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The "formula" does indeed make a big difference. Adobe varies so widely that no estimate of lifespan is useful without qualification. A useful estimate would have to include climate in which it is found, whether it has been maintained, it's ingredients, and type of construction.</p>
<p>Thus an adobe house built on concrete footings protects the bricks from spashes of rainfall and erosion of the bottom of a wall - a constant problem. Annual re-plastering is common in some parts of the world. I have read reports of an adobe house built and lived in for decades in a rain forest&#160;! Some near-eastern locations have adobe structures older than two millenia. Mixing either cement or bitumen with natural adobe creates a brick which competes with fired clay in longevity ands water resistence.<a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStasi2_d3b5.html" title="User:Stasi2">Stasi2</a> 15:37, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This and the <a href="../../../m/u/d/Mudbrick.html" title="Mudbrick">mudbrick</a> article should IMHO be combined or at least thought through more systematically. As presently presented (and linked to other articles) there is a lot of overlap but some questionable patterns. Some questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there a clear typology for earthen materials in terms of composition - either human engineered or natural (i.e., the clay, lime, sand, &amp; OM naturally occuring)? If so, could it be the basis for a more logically organized set of articles?</li>
<li>Or is it related to climate (adobe where it's arid and earthen structures can be maintained for centuries, and mudbrick in more humid climates)? In which case maybe the pages should be merged.</li>
<li>Or is it more cultural - we use adobe, they (poor folks that they be) use mud bricks? On this one I'm not trying to score PC points - note that the <a href="../../../m/u/d/Talk%7EMudbrick_3640.html" title="Talk:Mudbrick">mudbrick</a> article is linked to the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_International_development_85b4.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject International development">Wikipedia:WikiProject International development</a> project, but this adobe article is not...--<a href="../../../a/1/2/User%7EA12n_b0f6.html" title="User:A12n">A12n</a> 19:13, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>a part of this is written like a very incomplete how-to. Lets do some research and make a wikibook that tells the average person how to make their own adobe bricks, after all, it should mostly be a matter of the right proportion of both materials. People could learn and maybe help themselves landscape their yard.

<p>Not quite that easy as soil/dirt varies in its suitability for adobe bricks. Must have the right clay/sand content.</p>

<p>I'm wondering whether there should be a category called "sustainable technology" - but perhaps it would overlap too much with categories like <a href="../../../a/p/p/Category%7EAppropriate_technology_015e.html" title="Category:Appropriate technology">Category:Appropriate technology</a> &amp; <a href="../../../r/e/n/Category%7ERenewable_energy_5528.html" title="Category:Renewable energy">Category:Renewable energy</a>. For the moment, I'll just use <a href="../../../a/p/p/Category%7EAppropriate_technology_015e.html" title="Category:Appropriate technology">Category:Appropriate technology</a> (which is a subcategory of <a href="../../../d/e/v/Category%7EDevelopment_d647.html" title="Category:Development">Category:Development</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/s/Category%7ESustainability_8813.html" title="Category:Sustainability">Category:Sustainability</a>).</p>
<p>In the cases of <a href="../../../r/a/m/Rammed_earth.html" title="Rammed earth">Rammed earth</a>, <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adobe.html" title="Adobe">Adobe</a> &amp; <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_brick.html" title="Dutch brick">Dutch brick</a>, I think they reasonably belong in <a href="../../../a/p/p/Category%7EAppropriate_technology_015e.html" title="Category:Appropriate technology">Category:Appropriate technology</a>. At the moment, though, the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appropriate_technology.html" title="Appropriate technology">Appropriate technology</a> aspect of these technologies is not developed in the articles. Anyway, feel free to make a different edit or suggestion.</p>
<p>btw, <a href="../../../m/u/d/Mudbrick.html" title="Mudbrick">Mudbrick</a> needs either a lot of work, or to be merged with the Adobe article. --<a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESingkong2005_96e7.html" title="User:Singkong2005">Singkong2005</a> 02:58, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article and the <a href="../../../m/u/d/Mudbrick.html" title="Mudbrick">mudbrick</a> article imply that they are the same thing. I'm not sure that this is true - someone from a permaculture garden told me that adobe is built up from mud and then allowed to dry, whereas mudbricks are made into bricks and then dried. However, the articles seem to suggest otherwise, and so I've put the merge tags up so that we can discuss and resolve the issue. --<a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESingkong2005_96e7.html" title="User:Singkong2005">Singkong2005</a> 05:19, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>VOTE FOR MERGE; They are closely related enough to describe in a single article. Mudbrick could have a section in the Adobe article if needed. --<a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaleb.G_b828.html" title="User:Kaleb.G">Kaleb.G</a> 23:59, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think that merging the two is more reasonable. I believe that mudbrick is a forerunner to adobe but still not monumental enough to have it's own article. I have also heard that the only difference between the two is materials used, not methods used to produce (though these methods may change slightly from region to region). Look at other articles in this subject, such as concrete. The Concrete article has the different types of materials and processes used throughout history. I think that mentioning mudbrick in this same context within the Adobe article would be totally sufficient.</p>
<p>I dissagree... In parts of Africa, mud brick can also describe a method of construction where bricks are actually cut out of the hard earth under dry lakebeds (and often simply out of quarries that are not near a water source) and then stacked and coated with plaster.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Where exactly? This sounds interesting enough to merit an article. Re the topic of merging the articles, maybe what we are talking about is 2 kinds of "mud bricks" - one molded (merge that and adobe) and the other cut, per what you describe. The main problem here seems to be names (see also my <a href="#Mudbrick" title="">remarks</a> above); on another level there might be a kind of strategy for the articles on building with earth that would have a summary page (with definitions of categories and links to the main articles). --<a href="../../../a/1/2/User%7EA12n_b0f6.html" title="User:A12n">A12n</a> 00:06, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I still need to find time to deal with this article and <a href="../../../m/u/d/Mudbrick.html" title="Mudbrick">mudbrick</a> and in that context would discuss soils as the material but not chemistry per se. --<a href="../../../a/1/2/User%7EA12n_b0f6.html" title="User:A12n">A12n</a> 18:26, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm reading a book entitled <i>Native North American Art</i> by Berlo and Philips, where it is written, "Anasazi construction techniques at Chaco Canyon and Mesa Verde favoured the use of stone blocks. In the last few centuries, however, most Pueblo architecture has used adobe bricks as building blocks. Made in wooden moulds, by hand, by many members of the community, adobe block construction was an innovation introduced by the Spanish" (p. 49).</p>
<p>If Anasazi culture had extensive trade and cultural exchange with the Mimbres Mogollon culture, which extended into southern Mexico, then how is the following statement from the Wiki article true? "[A]dobe had been in use by indigenous peoples of the Americas in the Southwestern United States, Mesoamerica, and the Andean region of South America for several thousand years, although often substantial amounts of stone are used in the walls of Pueblo buildings."
