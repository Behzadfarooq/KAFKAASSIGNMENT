<p>There is so little NPOV in this section it is almost intolerable.</p>
<p>To quote, "However, by the time a young man is "in his early twenties, he will rely on his girlfriend or wife to be his primary emotional caregiver." If he can not establish an emotional relationship with a woman who views sex as connected to intimacy, then he is more likely to become depressed, commit suicide or die from illness."</p>
<p>Utter unmitigated twaddle.</p>
<p>There are far too many references into the same book, by Dr Leonard Sax. I'm not a child psychologist, just a parent, but I reckon one needs to make a contribution here.</p>

<p>This article seems to be more about discrimination against adolescents than adolescence in general. I think we could use more information about teenage history, psychology, culture, and such.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I concur. The discrimination section has a very biased POV, and a good deal of it is more conspiracy theory than fact. It contains lots of "research shows" and "research proves" without a single reference. As for the higher proportion of non-Caucasian incarcerations, the same holds true for adults as well. The statement is a generic lamentation not specific to adolescence. Issues such as income, housing, education, racial discrimination and geography are true factors why crime is more prevalent among certain demographics. As for groups of adolescents being singled out and observed by security and the like, the same holds true for <i>any</i> large group of homogeneous individuals. A homogeneous group has an inferred sense of power and single-mindedness, thus to people outside the group they are naturally perceived with distrust. This is only human nature (albeit an often negative attribute). The article itself makes a strong point why groups of adolescents in particular are singled out; peer pressure is greater among this demographic than any other. Peer pressure often causes individuals to go against their better judgment and conscience. Adults recognize this - <i>I personally</i> recognize this - because they have experienced it first hand. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDan_East_ecf4.html" title="User:Dan East">Dan East</a> 07:25, August 1, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>How about an article about preteens, as separate from this one? They're a distinct age of childhood that is different enough from younger children, and from teens with their own hormonal issues and changes in intelligence, to warrant a separate article I believe.</p>

<p>Isn't teenager a kind of informal term? isn't adolescent more appreciate as the title o encyclopedia article? -- <a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakuyaMurata_085a.html" title="User:TakuyaMurata">Taku</a> 00:51 19 May 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Does anyone have access to an Oxford English Dictionary and would care to look this word up? From what I undertand, it's a very recent coinage. -- <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Amusingly, the OED entry for <i>teenage</i> refers one to <i>teen</i><sup><small>2</small></sup>, where it is defined as brushwood for fences and hedges. Nearby is the sadly obsolete word <i>teenful</i>, defined as "causing trouble or sorrow; vexatious, troublesome, painful, grievous, distressing." <i>Teenage</i> also doesn't make it into the OED <i>Supplement</i>, it may make it into the most recent edition, which I don't have. Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary gives the date 1921 for the coinage. -- <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeone_else_bc03.html" title="User:Someone else">Someone else</a> 03:18 19 May 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
I want to rename the article to adolescence because</p>
<ol>
<li>teenager seems a new, inaccurate informal word</li>
<li>no all other language has a word corresponding to teenager</li>
<li>teenager connotates eleven, twelve or twenty are not young generation. Mere age has nothing to do with important and social changes occuring during adolecence.</li>
</ol>

<p>If the two concepts are different, address the difference in the articles.</p>
<ol>
<li>Teenager is a new word, but it is <i>completely</i> accurate (it's defined numerically!) and is not considered an informal usage.</li>
<li>Wikipedia is written in English.</li>
<li><i>teenager</i> and <i>young generation</i> are not identical concepts. -- <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeone_else_bc03.html" title="User:Someone else">Someone else</a> 03:36 21 May 2003 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, of course we shall (or already?) address the difference. And to be more precise what I meant is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Teenager is relatively less formal than adolescence e.g. britannica uses adolescence instead of teenager</li>
<li>Not everyone all over the world uses a concept teenager while the concept of adolescence is widely accepted</li>
<li>Teenager coonotates 12-year-old is outside of it by its strict definition but body changes, for example, can occur in 12-year-old for sure.</li>
</ol>

<p>There should definitely be an article at teenager. The word and its meaning have inspired a million songs from "A teenager in love" by Dion &amp; The Belmonts to "teenage dirtbag" by Wheatus. It also is the root of teenybopper, teen-dream, teen-angel. The word implies and embodies cultural aspects of teenage years that the word adolescent doesn't. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a> 21:36 21 May 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The discussion is not about if we should cover a word teenager, but about the naming of the article. Why not there should definitely be an article at adolescence? -- <a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakuyaMurata_085a.html" title="User:TakuyaMurata">Taku</a> 21:40 21 May 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This is English wikipedia and teenager is the more common form and has the advantage of its cultural context as well as the chronological one. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I am not sure really teenager is more common form. If so, why does Britannica uses adolesence, for instance? Besides, I am not sure why the article named adolesence doesn't talk about cultural aspect of its stage such as drug abuse. And what do you mean by chronological context? Teeanger is rather new word. -- <a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakuyaMurata_085a.html" title="User:TakuyaMurata">Taku</a> 21:47 21 May 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I am telling you as a native <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a> speaker that it is the more common form. You will <b>never</b> hear an English or American person saying - "Oh... I remember when I was an adolescent, those were the days". <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a> 21:50 21 May 2003 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And what can I say, we are talking about which one is the common form in community of encyclopedia. If you think this is a preference problem, we can certainly go to voting. -- <a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakuyaMurata_085a.html" title="User:TakuyaMurata">Taku</a> 21:54 21 May 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>TEENAGER = 13 to 19 years old</li>
<li>ADOLECENT = undergoing transition to adulthood</li>
</ul>
<p>They are <b>not</b> the same thing. Some teenagers are adolescent, some adolescents are teenagers. Some foods are plants, some plants are foods. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Then should we need a separate article? My point is that it seems fair enough that one article talks about both, as is the case now. -- <a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakuyaMurata_085a.html" title="User:TakuyaMurata">Taku</a> 22:02 21 May 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually I should have taken the trouble to read the article before I made my comments. Apologies for that. It seems to mostly describe years the physical tranformations of <a href="../../../p/u/b/Puberty.html" title="Puberty">puberty</a>, rather than the cultural aspects of teenage years. I think perhaps adolescence should redirect to <a href="../../../p/u/b/Puberty.html" title="Puberty">puberty</a> and teenager should mostly be about teen-culture. But then again adolescence is perhaps concerned with mental as well as physical maturation. I'll leave others to ponder this. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(Via edit conflict) In a perfect world, yes, we would have seperate articles, just as we have seperate articles about <a href="../../../f/o/o/Food.html" title="Food">food</a> and <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plant.html" title="Plant">plants</a>. But there is not anywhere near enough information in the article as it stands (on either topic) to make more than a pair of tiny stubs. The sensible thing to do is retain the current single article with adolescence as a redirect to it until such a time as someone wants to come along and write an entry on adolescence. And I <i>don't</i> mean a horrible little stub, I mean the real thing which would, by the way, not be restricted to talking about adolescence in humans. In a nutshell, <a href="../../../t/e/e/Teenager.html" title="Teenager">teenager</a> is a Westerm culture or sociology topic with a narrow focus on Western societies of the last handful of decades, the US in particular. <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolescence.html" title="Adolescence">Adolescence</a>, on the other hand, is clearly a topic that requires a cross-cultural and multi-species approach. ~~</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Then what about the new name such as teenage and adolescence or other terms like <a href="../../../y/o/u/Youngster.html" title="Youngster">youngster</a>, <a href="../../../y/o/u/Youth.html" title="Youth">youth</a> or such. I know they are not the same as teenage. But for example, I suppose pubery can occur before 12 or after 19 depending on envrionments young people grow up. -- <a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakuyaMurata_085a.html" title="User:TakuyaMurata">Taku</a> 22:24 21 May 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Teenager is short, simple, and obvious. I don't think we need a title that is longer than the entry it stands at the head of. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It's so only if the teenager article only focuses on discussion of teenage culture. If not, the title seems rather misleading. I completely agree that we eventually need a separate article. But now adolescence seems fine because it contains mention about puberty and teenager with a subtopic since there is no much material now besides, it is rather limited in western culture, particularly in US. -- <a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakuyaMurata_085a.html" title="User:TakuyaMurata">Taku</a> 22:55 21 May 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Personally, I think we should move all medical information regarding puberty into <a href="../../../p/u/b/Puberty.html" title="Puberty">puberty</a> with a link to it from <a href="../../../t/e/e/Teenager.html" title="Teenager">teenager</a>. I also think "teenager" and "adolescent" are too similar words to be placed in different articles. Any differences how the terms are used could be explained in the article. I don't really mind making <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolescent.html" title="Adolescent">adolescent</a> the main article, but I've always thought "teenager" was the more common term being used in everyday language, though I am not a native speaker of English. However, if we should follow <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28common_names%29_764d.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)</a> that's what we should be looking for: the most common form used today.<br /></dd>
<dd>Regarding "adolescence", I think this has more in common with "puberty" than "teenager", as it's not a term being used <i>on</i> someone undergoing changes into adulthood, but rather to the <i>process</i> of it, or am I wrong? If not, I see "puberty" as the more appropriate name of the two as the article will contain all the medical information as well, and even though there might not yet be enough material to make two full articles if we separate <a href="../../../t/e/e/Teenager.html" title="Teenager">teenager</a> and <a href="../../../p/u/b/Puberty.html" title="Puberty">puberty</a> I think it would still be worth doing it to make things more clear. As it is now, it feels a bit weird to be redirected to <a href="../../../t/e/e/Teenager.html" title="Teenager">teenager</a> when entering <a href="../../../p/u/b/Puberty.html" title="Puberty">puberty</a>, and to see all the medical information regarding puberty when reading about teenagers.</dd>

<p>The term "Adolescent" is used all the time in biology. You ever heard of a teenage mouse or bird? <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>That's a good point. I think the best would in that case be to have a separate <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolescent.html" title="Adolescent">adolescent</a> article explaining this stage taking all species into account, and have <a href="../../../t/e/e/Teenager.html" title="Teenager">teenager</a> focus on humans only.

<p>About which one is common. That is our agreement that articles should be named a common name. But I think this common means common in encyclopedia. For example, <a href="../../../a/g/i/Aging.html" title="Aging">aging</a> is redirected to <a href="../../../s/e/n/Senescence.html" title="Senescence">senescence</a>. I doubt senescence is more common than aging. We can apply the same logic to here. I can agree with making either one article or two articles. But if we have just one containing about puberty, adolescence and teenage stuff, the title teenager seems weird. I mean the article named adolescence having mention about teenage seems make sence but I don't think vice versa. -- <a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakuyaMurata_085a.html" title="User:TakuyaMurata">Taku</a> 02:17 22 May 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Fair enough. My removal of it was just in response to the article <a href="../../../t/w/e/Tween.html" title="Tween">tween</a> being merged here, which makes no sense to me.

<p>But isn't tween article is awfully short? By definition, preteen or tween is differnt than teenager for sure, but we don't need a separate article for each term. Besides, I presume a word preteen or tween is inspired from teenage. It sounds fair enough to merge them to here. -- <a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakuyaMurata_085a.html" title="User:TakuyaMurata">Taku</a> 14:53 22 May 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>No, because by definition a <a href="../../../p/r/e/Preteen.html" title="Preteen">preteen</a> is not a teenager. Articles should remain specifically about their subject from the title. However, one possibility I suppose would be to rename this page "adolescence", then tween possibly would fit. -- <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvercat_8d16.html" title="User:Evercat">Evercat</a></p>

<dd>It is the case in a dictionary and wiikipedia is not a dictionary. Yes the trouble is I think the current name of this article. Today I add a mention about coming of age celemony genpuki in Japan but it sounds awufully weird that teenage samurai completed genpuku. I guess the trouble the word teenage implies contemporary and western society, which is one that we certain should cover, but the article should not limited to it. -- <a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakuyaMurata_085a.html" title="User:TakuyaMurata">Taku</a> 16:16 22 May 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As you see, I added particularly social aspect of teenagers or adolescents. I am afraid what I have done might look like trying to haijack the article. But it is true that what I added is what I think we should discuss. I still want to move this article to adolescence. As I said just above, parts like teenage samurai, preteen and puberty seem odd in an article named under teenager. To me, adolescence is a wider term than teenager. And regarding common words issue, we need to use a common word in terms of encyclopediac or academic community. Britannica uses adolescence instead of teenager, there is also an example of <a href="../../../a/g/i/Aging.html" title="Aging">aging</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/n/Senescence.html" title="Senescence">senescence</a>. In everyday life we usually use aging not senescence. I agree in the future we might need a separate article but now what's wrong with an article named adolesence containing about a particular concept in western society, or teenager. -- <a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakuyaMurata_085a.html" title="User:TakuyaMurata">Taku</a> 13:18 23 May 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is it as common as I think for the term "teen" to be used incorrectly to refer to minor teens only. It seems to me that sometimes people forget teen also includes 18 and 19 year olds. I've heard, for example, people discussing whether teens in the U.S. should be able to vote but since 18 and 19 year old can already vote, it seems they where using the term incorrectly to refer to minor teens only.

<dd>I think you're right, that "teen" often refers to a particular set (often starting at age 14, not 13, because that's the age when most people start high school. This may also be why 19-year-olds are sometimes excluded, as they're usually out of high school.) In a completely different context, that of pornography, "teen" refers almost exclusively to 18- and 19-year-olds as any younger would be illegal! "Teenager" redirects to this article, so if there's a place to add this info without it being too clumsy then I think it would be a perfectly fine addition. --<a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus3_dcf6.html" title="User:Icarus3">Icarus</a> 06:03, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>What are teens considered? Are they children or not. These teens are not adults. If your not an adult then what are you? Then your probally a Child. There not young adults because young adults range in there 20's. Most people call teens kids alongside calling them teens. Even teens when refrencing other teens say "oh it was that kid" or "hey kid got any change" Even a news program for young people that airs on ABC is called "TeenKid's" News. Many young people want to consider themselves adults or young adults just because it makes them feel better or great then they ever were. Isn't adolesence a stage in childhood or more obviously the last one? Anyone under 18 is considred a minor, juvenile, child, etc. I somebody has to adress this issue. You need to show both sides not just tell you opinion, you need to show both sides.</p>
<p>Anyone under 18 is a child.<a href="../../../h/m/r/User%7EHmrox_a76a.html" title="User:Hmrox">Hmrox</a> 05:31, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Anyone under 18 (in the US, at least) is a minor. In some contexts, "minor" and "child" are synonyms. In other contexts, "child" means prepubescent and "adolescent" is a separate categorization. There's no simple "yes" or "no" answer. --<a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus3_dcf6.html" title="User:Icarus3">Icarus</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../i/c/a/User_talk%7EIcarus3_9890.html" title="User talk:Icarus3">Hi!</a>)</sup> 06:46, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Both are not adults, but one group is far more emotionally, sexually, and biologically mature than the other. Saying adolescence is a stage in childhood is like saying old age is a stage of adulthood. Some similarities, but even more differences. In any case, I've heard people in their twenties referred to as "kid". Terminology does not prove fact. And if you go back a few centuries, the "end of childhood" bar ends even earlier, at around 12. The Vikings, Japanese, Jews, and many other races and cultures had and still have rites of passage around 12-13. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Patrick_198a.html" title="User:Lord Patrick">Lord Patrick</a> 07:58, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Confirmatiom in Christianity is not considered at least in the Catholic Church a "rite of passage" it is a ritual that makes you more closer Christ ant the Church community.</p>
<dl>
<dd>In the church I grew up in, it was also the time at which you were officially an adult member of the church, a member in your own right instead of by default through your parents' membership. This is, by definition, a coming of age. --<a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus3_dcf6.html" title="User:Icarus3">Icarus</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../i/c/a/User_talk%7EIcarus3_9890.html" title="User talk:Icarus3">Hi!</a>)</sup> 03:19, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I did say it WASN'T a "Rite of Passage" in the Catholic Church..</p>

<dd>Sorry, but I don't understand what you mean now. Are you saying that the Catholic church is different from the church I had experience with? Or that regardless, it should not be considered a rite of passage? Or something else entirely? --<a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus3_dcf6.html" title="User:Icarus3">Icarus</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../i/c/a/User_talk%7EIcarus3_9890.html" title="User talk:Icarus3">Hi!</a>)</sup> 22:12, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is a diffrence between being being considered and what something really is. To SOME People it's CONSIDRED a "Rite of Passage" but in reality it is not in that of the Catholic Church I can only speak for the Catholic Church, and not these Protestant Churches. In the Catholic Church it is a Rite that brings a person closer to Christ and the Community. In the Eastern Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church Infants recieve the Sacrament of Confirmation and your telling me that these infants are going through a right of passage. Please.. Give me a break and enough with this.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hey, no need to get annoyed. I'm not trying to give you a problem, just to understand what the problem is. Thanks for clarifying what you said earlier. In the denominations where infants receive this sacrament, it clearly is not functioning in any way as a rite of passage. I do not agree with removing the entire reference, however, as in some denominations (like you, I can only speak for ones I'm familiar with) it is a de facto rite of passage due to being widely considered such, and because some denominations use it to mark the point at which a member becomes a member in their own right, rather than as en extention of their parents' membership.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The section you just removed states that this is only in some denominations, and it could be clarified further if necessary. I'll try to do so now; if you think it still needs to be altered for clarity, I hope that you make any minor changes you think are necessary or come back to this talk page to suggest ways it might be improved. --<a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus3_dcf6.html" title="User:Icarus3">Icarus</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../i/c/a/User_talk%7EIcarus3_9890.html" title="User talk:Icarus3">Hi!</a>)</sup> 05:36, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the felelings of an adolescent it says that they're not mentally or emotionally able to handle sex which could be true but maybe not for some cases.

<p>The whole "Psychology of Adolescents" section deserves no place on Wikipedia. The author keeps on presenting the opinions of a certain</p>
<p>Leonard Sax, who is clearly a very right-wing, conservative, opinionated individual. Furthermore, his opinions are presented as being fact</p>
<p>(Repeatedly) simply by placing them in quotation marks. What's more, these rather extreme opinions of one sort aren't even counterbalanced by</p>
<p>extreme views of another sort.</p>
<p>But my main qualm lies with that it's not very hard to argue that the said opinions, presented as fact, are wrong. What's more, they are</p>
<p>almost certainly influenced by the religious and cultural status quo in one small place in the world. In order to back this up with evidence,</p>
<p>as the article's writer didn't, I shall analyse the offending parts of the article below.</p>
<p><br />
'adolescents are not mentally or emotionally prepared to handle feelings and emotions that come with sex' This particular sweeping generalisation doesn't even have the courtesy of quotation marks around it to try to make the fact it is purely</p>
<p>opinion valid. Furthermore, having no experience of something does not mean that said thing will necessarily do you harm.</p>
<p>'nor financially able to support children' Another statement not even quoted from a source. It appears to work off the assumption that there are no wealthy teenagers in existance.</p>
<p>'"early sexual activity - whether in or out of a romantic relationship - does far more harm than good."' At least this particular statement is a quotation. However, it is undeniably false. All over the world there are teenage sexual relationships</p>
<p>which are positive things. This articles writer is presenting as fact the concept that ALL teenage sexual relationships always do more harm</p>
<p>than good. The writer doesn't even use a qualify such as "Arguably" or "Probably"</p>
<p>"The harm done to teenagers who engage in sexual activities is especially true for girls" Once again not even presented as a quotation in the article, so all the objections raised for the previous sentance apply, plus the fact this</p>
<p>is brazenly the author's opinion presented as fact.</p>
<p>'Boys are less likely to see sex as connected to an emotional relationship. However, by the time a young man is "in his early twenties, he</p>
<p>will rely on his girlfriend or wife to be his primary emotional caregiver."' More sweeping generalisations, only some of which are quoted from the book of Mr Russel. The concept that a woman needs to "Provide" care to</p>
<p>a man is frankly offensive people people of both genders, not to mention the fact that the whole article ignores the issue of homosexual</p>
<p>relationships.</p>
<p>'If he can not establish an emotional relationship with a woman, who does view sex as connected to intimacy, then he is more likely to become</p>
<p>depressed, commit suicide or die from illness.' Once again, this particular part of the article is not a quotation from any source and is presented as impartial fact. The concept that</p>
<p>single men are more likly to become ill and die does have a source cited, however, I find the concept to be spurious at best, and would like</p>
<p>to be provided with a citation I can confirm opposed to the title of an innaccessable tome. I know that this is not a Wikipedia requirement,</p>
<p>however, for such a contraversial statement it would be a courtesy. Furthermore, the claim that a man who is in a relationship with a woman</p>
<p>who is "Not a caregiver" is equally contraversial.</p>
<p><br />
Finally I would like to come to the most grievous criticism of this section of the article. Not only are there many individual parts of the</p>
<p>article, but they are all tied together by an underlying bias. Specifically that of Conservative Christian Right-Wing America. No article can</p>
<p>be considered impartial, let alone accurate, when faced with such an extreme bias.</p>
<p>This is why I must STRONGLY IMPLORE that this article, at the very least this specific section, be put under consideration for serious</p>
<p>ammentment or a full re-write.</p>

<li>I found some links to some of the sources cited. I don't know Dr Sax, but he has a Ph.D and an MD, so I am willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. He clearly knows more on the subject than I do. Also, I imagine if you check his book you will find the further sources you are looking for. From it's <a href="http://www.whygendermatters.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.whygendermatters.com/" rel="nofollow">website</a> there is praise for it from Time and the New York Times, among others. He may be conservative (I don't know), but I am sure they wouldn't praise his book if he couldn't back up his claims. Also, there appear to be a number of references in the article, not just from him, including from the US and at least one state government. In your tirade you don't offer any competing evidence, just an ideology. If you have better data or more information to provide then by all means <a href="../../../b/o/l/Wp%7Ebold.html" title="Wp:bold">be bold</a> and edit the article yourself. A word of caution, however. Don't add "extreme views of another sort" to balance the article out. Wikipedia should be a factual source of unbiased information, not a forum for competing polemics. --<a href="../../../i/l/l/User%7EIlluminato_0afe.html" title="User:Illuminato">Illuminato</a> 22:23, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
