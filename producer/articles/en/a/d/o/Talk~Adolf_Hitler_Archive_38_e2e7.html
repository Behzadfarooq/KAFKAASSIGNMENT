<li>Because "Adolf Hitler"'s articles are so painstakingly long and enourmous full of incredible detail, (more than the <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_2730.html" title="George Washington">George Washington</a> article even) you end up with all this controversy.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I suggest that Adolf Hitler's articles be compressed with several sections and lone articles be <i>completely removed</i>. Wikipedia is not a textbook it is not a biography book either. Let's keep this on the level of an <b>article</b>.</p>
<p>And this article alone has about 13,700 words. That is longer than some multi-chapter short stories!</p>
<p>In other words: keep it short, keep it simple. Wikipedia isn't a dumping ground for all the information you know because your mom told you so or from all the collection of books you have.</p>
<p>Take at least 40 seconds to think about people who use Wikipedia as guide source of information. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColonel_Marksman_9cb1.html" title="User:Colonel Marksman">Colonel Marksman</a> 18:08, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The world pays far more attention to Hitler than to George Washington. There has been far more written in published sources about Hitler than George Washington. The greater coverage of Hitler on Wikipedia is a reflection of society's greater interest in Hitler. This is how it should be, it would be wrong if Wikipedia devoted the same amount of space to Washington and Hitler, if society devotes much more attention to Hitler than to Washington. <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDrogo_Underburrow_7294.html" title="User:Drogo Underburrow">Drogo Underburrow</a> 22:51, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps so. Doesn't mean you can dump all the information you can into this article (or any article for that matter).</li>
<li>How about I say everything plain and simple:</li>
</ul>
<p>On this article, keep only the <b>core importances</b> (general information). Come on, this is an <b>article</b>, not a book, and the same for anything on Wikipedia. If we only keep core importances on only Hitler himself, then length wouldn't be an issue.</p>
<p>Don't tell me all the information here is of core importance.</p>
<p>Also, by keeping these core importances, you eliminate virtually all problems with POV'ing and all this minute small detail crap. (Except maybe the religion part of it) It is those core elements everyone can agree with anyway and can't argue.</p>
<p>The more information you want to add, the more dispute and controversy there may be about it. Might as well add the times he picked his nose when his officers were watching.</p>
<p>Yes, if there is far more interest in Adolf Hitler than George Washington, then there will be more core information, but that's not what I see. There are articles dedicated to his health or religous outlook.</p>
<ul>
<li>You're still as yet to counter anything I'm trying to say (you're using George Washington, fewer care for him argument to support yourself in defense which frankly is doing very little for you). I'm giving you principles to think about, and you still have not yet countered any of them or given me any reason to repeal my proposal or suggestions. If you want to argue with me, attack my core principles with <i>reasons</i>. Otherwise, I just keep coming still standing by what I say, the same for anyone else trying to argue something. Destroy their point and prove their thinking is wrong or falls short, and everything else goes down. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColonel_Marksman_9cb1.html" title="User:Colonel Marksman">Colonel Marksman</a> 19:39, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The neutrality and factual accuracy of this section are disputed. Just what is factually wrong with the text? Lets see if we can agree on that first, before tackling the harder question of the text's neutrality. <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDrogo_Underburrow_7294.html" title="User:Drogo Underburrow">Drogo Underburrow</a> 23:00, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Seems that all those who were busy reverting the current version of this page continually through out the day before it was protected, have nothing to say. It seems that only Str77 has studied Hitler, and the rest of his supporters are just that; supporters, who don't know much about Hitler, but do know that whatever Str77 says, is what they support, and therefore they revert in his behalf. So I guess we have to wait for Str77 to state his objections, so that the rest of his crowd can then chime in, "me too!" if need be. - <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDrogo_Underburrow_7294.html" title="User:Drogo Underburrow">Drogo Underburrow</a> 06:45, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well normally 2 or 3 editors can enforce their POV stance, as they would force any opponent to break 3RR or give up. This did not happen here. FWIW the now put to sleep text had included theolocical discussions which are not the scope of this article, but they were used to draw OR-conclusions. Personally I find it should simply say "raised catholic" - "did not go to mass in later years" - both verifyable and not disputed. But sadly some people wanted to tinker with that and infer certain conclusions. <a href="../../../a/g/a/User%7EAgathoclea_2154.html" title="User:Agathoclea">Agathoclea</a> 07:04, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Correct. I also supsect Str1977 is looking to find something, anything, that he deems not accurate to support this tag.</dd>
<dd>I think the real objection is just about emphasis in content, and inclusion of original research stating his own conclusion of what the facts mean, according to his own understanding, instead simply reporting what the various writers actually say and know.</dd>
<dd>Also, there is a desire to make the section smaller and take away the MK quotes, as well as the mention of the nature of the Table Talk source, which he knows is the source of virtually all the anti-Christian quotes attributed to Hitler. Therefore, if anyone mentions the questionable reliablity of this source, it will have the effect of raising questoins for readres who based their belief that Hitler was not a Christian on such a source. And, this will thus undermine the POV they want to push. <a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 07:06, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There never was an attempt on my part, Gio, to do away with the MK quotes, which you could finally provide with some references - we have an online edition linked, so it isn't that difficult) - I even included them as much as I could into "my" version. Also, it is not me who is spreading falsehoods about Table Talk - I acknowledge along with those writer I am proud to call my fellow historians that it has to be used with caution. But you want to stamp it as false, hearsay and also falsely claimed that all anti-Christian quotes come from there. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 13:57, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, first of all, the Table Talk is not "the source of virtually all the ant-Christian quotes attributed to Hitler." You've got Goebbels and Speer, two rather significant figures. And Speer mentions being present when Bormann was eagerly writing down Hitler's anti-Christian statements, providing independent confirmation of at least some validity to the Table Talk. The article could reasonably draw on Goebbels and Speer, and leave the Table Talk out of it. A good article should draw on the best sources, not everything out there.</p>
<p>Second, if one insists on insisting on including the Table Talk criticism, why not also include statements that criticize reliance on Hitler's public statements? Hitler, after all, lied a lot in public. He knew the hold of the church on many Germans enough to realize that public attacks on the church were a bad idea from a propaganda standpoint, and he ordered some top Nazis to remain in the church even if they wanted to leave. So there could be a footnote insisting that any public statement by Hitler on religion has to be used with caution, since he lied a lot, and didn't want to upset the German Christian population by attacking the church. Now, this would seem to me to be silly, but no sillier than insisting that the article include criticism of a source that others are entirely willing to dispense with. <a href="../../../b/y/t/User%7EBytwerk_263a.html" title="User:Bytwerk">Bytwerk</a> 13:53, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh. I thought you (Bytwerk) were addressing the topic of this section, not criticising Gio.</dd>
<dd>Why don't we have statements that criticize reliance on Hitler's public statements? Probably because none of the sources we have used say that. Perhaps you can look in Steigmann-Gall and find where he says that for us. I don't think that he ever said that, so why don't you give me a page number? But in any event, do you agree that the article is factually accurate? None of your criticism has been about factual errors. <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDrogo_Underburrow_7294.html" title="User:Drogo Underburrow">Drogo Underburrow</a> 14:34, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just to state the obvious, but outside a very limited community of racists, Hitler is not well-liked. Therefore, few would want him associated with the groups that they are members of if they can possibly avoid it. The fact that Hitler was raised Catholic may then be seen as an embarassment to Christians in general and Catholics in specific. Therefore, whenever someone with strong Christian beliefs, particularly Catholic ones, makes edits that serve to make Hitler seem less Christian, there is a potential, if perhaps unconscious, ulterior motive. I say all this not to attack Christians by assuming bad faith but to prod Christians into looking into their own motives and considering whether their allegiance to their religion might possibly be biasing their judgement. For that matter, if Hitler did indeed become an atheist, this might be seen as an embarassment to atheists, so there's room for possible biases in more than one direction. Perhaps the article would be best off if we simply stated the few incontrovertible facts we have and left inferences to the reader. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Al</a> 14:26, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Of course, Ali, that Hitler was raised a Catholic is embarrassing for us Catholics but that is not the point as no one disputes that. It raises questions on how to best bring up a child (and believe me, the Catholic content was not the problem in Hitler's case). The contentious point here is that some are pushing the view that Hitler committed his crimes as a Catholic in order to blackwash the Church or Christianity in general. You are right, Ali, that we all should look into our preconceptions and biases - but that applies both to Christians and non-Christians/atheists. If Hitler were an atheists, you are right, that might be embarassing for them too, but and some are embarassed by such claims and wrote "atheist apologetics". I don't mean that in any derogative way as they are right to do that, to defend themselves against unjust accusations. But some are overdoing it by trying to make Hitler a Christian or a Catholic, as if there were only two alternatives. Such tactics have to be resisted too - somone who wants to read such anti-Christian polemics can visist websites another editor likes to link to frequently. As for the facts, I think we merely talked about facts before this section was created as a POV pushing rendition of the pro-Christian statements. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 13:57, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I guess that explains why PETA doesn't use him as a poster-child. He was a vegetarian, loved animals, and was very concerned for their welfare. He opposed women using cosmetics, I hear, because of animal-testing. He made fun of people calling them carrion-eaters. I am getting off topic here, I apologise. I guess I'm getting bored waiting for Str77 or even Bytwerk to acknowledge that the article is factually accurate, so we can move on to the harder part of agreeing that it is NPOV. <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDrogo_Underburrow_7294.html" title="User:Drogo Underburrow">Drogo Underburrow</a> 14:43, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Indeed. Hitler was also strongly anti-pornography (<a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/holocaust/peopleevents/pandeAMEX87.html" class="external free" title="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/holocaust/peopleevents/pandeAMEX87.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/holocaust/peopleevents/pandeAMEX87.html</a>), and yet he is not a poster child for either the right- or left-wing groups that oppose porn. Although, as Marge Simpson said, "There's no shame in being a pariah", it sure looks like Hitler is a hot potato that nobody wants to be stuck with. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Al</a> 19:31, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Given that I've got a stack of papers to read at the end of the semester, I'm not paying a lot of attention to Wikipedia at the moment. But to keep DU happy, here's a nicely sourced quotation on Hitler's dissembling views on religion:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"[T]he overwhelmingly Christian character of the German people meant that Hitler dissembled his personal views behind preachy invocations of the Almighty, and distanced himself from the radically irreligious within his own Party, even though his own views were probably more extreme.... In reality, his views were a mixture of materialist biology, a faux-Nietzschean contempt for core, as distinct from secondary, Christian values, and a visceral anti-clericalism."</dd>

<dd>I agree that is a good source, although the author is partial to the Catholic Church, we should include his view. In a review of the book here,<a href="http://www.brothersjudd.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/reviews.detail/book_id/382" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.brothersjudd.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/reviews.detail/book_id/382" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, does make th e point that, "In one of the more striking quotes in the book, one that Hoffer would have noted, Burleigh cites Hitler favorably discussing Roman Catholicism: Be assured, we too put faith in the first place and not cognition. One has to be able to believe in a cause. Only faith creates a state. What motivates people to go and do battle and die for religious ideas? Not cognition, but blind faith."

<dd>In its current state, I don't find any factual errors -- but the issue is a little more complicated than that. Let's say that I did an exhaustive study of DU, and found all the bad things he'd ever done. I could then put these into an essay that presented him as a highly unpleasant human being, the facts of which would be unassailable, but DU might still reasonably argue that, although the "facts" were accurate, the way they were presented led the reader to false conclusions. <a href="../../../b/y/t/User%7EBytwerk_263a.html" title="User:Bytwerk">Bytwerk</a> 16:31, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I understand that you have issues with the article. Its important to narrow down the issues so we can deal with them. Right now the tag says that the article is factually disputed. I'm trying to get rid of that part of the tag, so it will only say that there is an NPOV dispute. What you don't like is an NPOV issue, its using facts to mislead, in your opinion. That is an NPOV problem only. Since you agree that there are no factual errors, if we can get a few more editors to also agree, we can move forward in dispute resolution a small step by getting rid of the "factual error" tag. <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDrogo_Underburrow_7294.html" title="User:Drogo Underburrow">Drogo Underburrow</a> 16:40, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No problem. I simply got tired of waiting for Str77. He found time to revert three times a day, and he has been editing other articles, but he hasn't posted here. I think the main issue here, like Bytwerk says, is not over facts, but over the selection of facts and what that selection implies, which is an NPOV dispute.

<dd>There's not much we can do if one side won't show up. Bytwerk is busy reading papers; He doesn't have time to make more than a few comments here and there is my impression. He also didn't edit war , so his role in the dispute was minimal, though he does have an opinion about the article and strongly prefers the other version I think. Str77 is basically the only other player, so to speak, on the opposing team. AnnH (Musical Linguist]] admits she knows little about Hitler (she has said on this talk page, "I've never read a book about Hitler".); she simply backs up Str1977 always, reverting to whatever he writes. Others are only casual participants. As you can see, while they did a lot of reverting, in support of Str1977, they have nothing to say; I expect Str1977 to be the only voice on the "other team" aside from occasional comments. - <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDrogo_Underburrow_7294.html" title="User:Drogo Underburrow">Drogo Underburrow</a> 19:40, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm glad you see meatpuppetry as a problem, Gio. You didn't see it as a problem when you pretended to have no connection to BelindaGong, whose account existed for the purpose of reverting to your version, and supporting you (with votes) on talk pages, and who was shown by a usercheck to be editing from the same IP. You didn't see it as a problem when you denied (while forgetting that you were logged on as Freethinker99) having any connection to Freethinker99,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGiovanni33&amp;diff=39658698&amp;oldid=39658454" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGiovanni33&amp;diff=39658698&amp;oldid=39658454" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> whose first edit was a support for you while you were blocked for puppetry, and whose second edit was a revert to your version. You don't see it as a problem with MikaM, who has about 32 reverts to your version out of 40 article edits, and you don't see it as a problem with Kecik, who has 33 reverts to your version out of 36 article edits. Most editors in your position would be a little <i>embarrassed</i> to make the remark you made.</p>
<p>To Drogo, it is disappointing that you are still making personal remarks about me on the talk page, while ignoring the wrongdoing of others. You started off by drawing attention to the fact that I claim to be obedient to the Pope, as if that automatically disqualified me from being able to edit this article legitimately. It made no difference to you that Giovanni, who proves by his edits that his main purpose on Wikipedia is in undermining Christianity, and who makes long posts about how Christianity is like believing that the moon is made of cheese, has an anti-Christian agenda. Call on others to revert the Catholic because she's a Catholic, but don't bother to say that an editor is anti-Christian, because that's off topic here. You criticize Catholics for reverting, but it doesn't matter to you that you, Alienus, Giovanni, Mika, Kecik, and Agathoclea revert. If you're not a Catholic, you're <i>allowed</i> to revert. You come to my page and to Str1977's to complain about use of edit summaries to carry on a conversation, but it doesn't matter to you that you and <i>particularly</i> Giovanni (plus Mika, Kecik, etc.) do the same, or that Alienus even referred to another editor's genitals in an edit summary. You complain about Catholics who revert before they come to the talk page (even Str1977 who contributes very thoroughly to the talk page), but it doesn't bother you that Alienus did the same, and that Kecik almost invariably does that. You stretch the policy of original research to the extent that you won't allow the standard dictionary definition of "practising Catholic" to be used, but you introduce edits that actually state <i>as a fact</i> what Hitler personally felt (not what he said he felt).<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adolf_Hitler&amp;diff=52802624&amp;oldid=52800452" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adolf_Hitler&amp;diff=52802624&amp;oldid=52800452" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>I have already stated that I do not and will not revert to Str1977 for the sake of reverting to him, just because I like him (although I do). I did not revert to his "totalitarian", as I have no knowledge of the nazi regime. I do note, however, that Mika and Kecik, both reverted to Giovanni's "fascist", having followed him here from the Christianity article (and other articles) to give him extra support. (Oh sorry, I forgot, they're not Catholic, so their reverts are not <i>relevant</i> to this page.) As I have said before, I had no knowledge of Str1977's existence before I joined Wikipedia; nor had he any knowledge of mine. We live in different countries. I did not know his name until I had been here for seven months. He edits many articles that I don't touch. I edit (and vote at) many pages that he never comes near. My last two hundred edits contain two reverts to his version, and one support for his version on a talk page. See how that compares with MikaM and Kecik. In fact, my last two hundred edits have only two reverts other than administrative rollbacks which are not based on content dispute, and which involve articles in which I have no interest. Except that the edit warring, puppetry, personal attacks, etc. from non-Catholics are <i>not relevant</i> in your view, it would be interesting to count the reverts in the last two hundred edits of those who support your version.</p>
<p>Regarding my "no knowledge" of Hitler, I am not a historian; I am a qualified linguist, experienced in analysing text for meaning. I originally put this page on my watchlist because of the high amount of vandalism, rather than out of any particular interest. I know what "practising Catholic" means, except when people with an agenda try to redefine it. If you mention an author who claims that Hitler went to Mass every Sunday, I will not be in a position to reject it. I am, very much, in a position to reject the eccentric, original-research, and POV-pushing idea that someone who never went to Mass as an adult, was in some way still a practising Catholic. As far as having nothing to say other than support for Str1977 goes, that is a rather cheap shot, all the cheaper as you direct it only at me, while ignoring Kecik; it is also untrue, as I have provided arguments at length about the meaning of "practising Catholic", including the Oxford English Dictionary definition, and references to the Catechism of the Catholic Church and the Code of Canon Law. I am also, as a linguist (but even more, as an ordinary, intelligent editor) quite qualified to notice that when the quotations that support one POV are put in block quotes, and the quotations that support the other POV are simply inserted into the middle of the paragraph, that that is not respecting neutrality.</p>
<p>Finally, one reason why I did not contribute yesterday is that I was quite discouraged by the unjusified attacks and personal remarks, which are all the more disgraceful when we recall that remarks made about the other side are constantly criticized. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 12:07, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wow, talk about an over-reaction and a violation of civility (from an admin no less!). Ofcoruse, I won't respond to this at lengh to refute it, as it is just another major distraction from this article, but I will say that the attack above is indicative of extreme defensiveness (getting too close to the truth?). Strategic weakness + fear = extreme visciousness. To lash out like this is counter-productive. I just advise you to cool down, remain calm and level headed and realize that we all have legitimate perceptions of the same reaslity, but lets try to stick to the issue and not get sid-tracked into launching such personal attacks against other editors personal motivations, etc (which you may sincerely believe, but which I don't think is true at all). No one here is tyring to "attack Christianity." No one has that agenda. If telling the truth and being honest is 'attacking Christianity" that says more about your view of Christianity, than anything else. On wikipedia, it advised users not to write about thinks In anycase, there is no need to launch into a full attack and bring up everything you can from the distant past, when its not relevant, along with bad faith interpretations and conclusions. Just maybe it is possible that others can disagree with your POV? I read somewhere in the Wikiguidlines that when dealing with a subject you are too close to yourself it can affect your ability to recognize your bias your overly emotional committment to it will cause you to be overly defensive. I think this is a classic case of this happenening.<a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 20:51, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hitler's religious beliefs - NPOV and factual dispute</span></h2>
<p>I put my objections here since above is already crammed:</p>
<ul>
<li>ommission of the (should be uncontroversial) fact that such an upbringing was common in Upper Austria. Confirmed by both Kershaw and Rissmann taht there was nothing special in Hitler’s upbringing.</li>
<li>Stylistically I also object to saying „by his RC parents“ – if he’s brought up a RC it is understood that his parents are RC and the stance of the two are covered in depth in the following sentence.</li>
<li>deletion of the influence of pan-german thinking and Darwinism – might not be universally accepted (though no contradictory voice has been given) but because of that I have already disclaimed by “According to Rissmann”</li>
<li>deletion of the fact (again, not contradicted by anyone) that Hitler didn’t have any religious or Christian or Catholic practice after he left home. No contradictory voice is given, hence it may count as undisputed. The factual reference is replaced by a weasel “a boyhood friend never saw him” – there is more than just one boyhood friend and that friend didn’t say that he never saw him go to Mass but that he never went to Mass and that he stated he “would not be forced into Church”, which is quite a different matter. (so Factual Accuracy is concerned, below abbreviated as FACT)</li>
<li>Refusal to accept the general and standard definition of what a “pracitising Catholic” constitutes. The “confirmation event” is raised to unwarranted prominence (it was an event where his rebellion became obvious, not the cause of the rebellion).</li>
<li>The misusing of Kershaw does not appear in the current version, so I won’t repeat my objections (noted above) which however remain valid. (This would have been a factual dispute.)</li>
<li>Though I agree with him I don’t like the characterization of Chadwick as eminent. In general I object to such classification of sources and authorities unless absolutely necessary. I especially object to them when they are false and weasely (see Toland below)</li>
<li>POV pushing by using a blockquote for Hitler’s pro-Christian statements.</li>
<li>I prefer adding a year to Hitler’s “always a Catholic” statement – other utterances are dated as well and especially in this case it is important when he said it. We shouldn’t attribute prophetic qualities to Hitler – he couldn’t make a valid statement about what he will “always” be, if he was speaking in earnest.</li>
<li>I protest against (re-)moving the factual reference of Hitler never ending his church membership and what Speer (referenced and disclaimed by “according to…”) had to say about that. – in the current version it is included much further down, hanging “in the air”.</li>
<li>I protest against the inclusion of the sentence: “Though Hitler spoke against traditional Christianity in general, he in fact may have been referring to Catholicism, according to Steigmann-Gall.“ – yes, it is referenced but is also utter bullocks, turning words around in Hitler’s mouth and in St-G’s is nothing more than a speculation</li>
<li>I also reject the following: “In any event, "No matter how much he vituperated against Christianity or the churches, Hitler gave no indication that he was now agnostic or atheistic: He displayed a continued attachment to a belief in God." – The „in any event“ is a unwarranted endorsement. The info warrant inclusion but IMHO should be included at a better place.</li>
<li>“As some branches of liberal Protestantism also had similar views,“ – I always preferred „As Protestantism was more open to such reinterpretations“, as it is problematic to associate liberal Protestantism in general (even if we say some branches) with the unclear „similar views“ (what views exactly?). No one will suspect me of POV pushing on this as I am quite openly not a liberal Protestant. I tried to use a compromise version which included the substance of both, but it just got reverted.</li>
<li>I object to calling John Toland (which is still linked wrongly) “notable Hitler biographer“, as it is a POV endorsement of him (see above) and also wrong. Kershaw would fit that description, even the now dated Bullock (though I’d still object)</li>
<li>I also object to the inclusion of Toland’s claim that Hitler was “Still a member in good standing of the Church of Rome despite detestation of its hierarchy“, as it is misleading given the facts of the matter. We have already stated (in either version) that Hitler didn’t leave the church but how good his standing was is quite another matter. (FACT)</li>
<li>I do not object to the mentioning of the „deicide“ issue and have included it in my version (though it might be better suited in the Anti-semitism section)</li>
<li>I reject the inclusion of the Lewy quote as it is based on Hitler’s Reichstag speech we already have quoted above. No need to include it twice.</li>
<li>"According to historian Richard Steigmann-Gall, much is known about Hitler's views on religion through Hitler's book, <i>Mein Kampf</i>.“ Introduces a whole section of problematic bits. What follows is quotes from Mein Kampf (still unreferenced) which are useful to include. However, this all needs to be integrated into the text (as my version did). Note that this is no section of retelling Mein Kampf or retelling Steinmann-Gall but one devoted to actually giving information about Hitler’s religion. Hence editorial notes explaining how Hitler used this word hat word are out of place.</li>
<li>„He also states his belief that the Aryan race was created by God,“ is nonsense, even more so if Hitler were a Christian, since of course the other races would fit in there too. If anything in this direction is notable it is Hitler’s belief about the JEws.</li>
<li>„Refering to God as the "Lord of Creation" and the necessity of obeying "His" will, show Hitler's Christian thinking“ is also nonsense, as these words contain no particular Christian wordings – a Jew, a Muslim, a Deist could have said the same thing. (FACT)</li>
<li>The following paragraph is completely sinking to the level of being a table of contents fort he Steinmann book: „Elsewhere in <i>Mein Kampf</i>, he says, Hitler makes references to Jesus. Other sources also show Hitler's Christian thinking, according to Steigmann-Gall. He notes an unpublished manuscript where Hitler sketched out his world-view, and he gives as an example a speech on April 1922 where Hitler said that Jesus was "the true God". Finally, Steigmann-Gall gives another example where in a private Nazi meeting Hitler again stated the centrality of Jesus' teachings to the Nazi movement.“</li>
<li>„Hitler's religious beliefs demonstrated the anti-Semitic view that Jesus was an Aryan rather than a Jew“ is both claiming something that hasn’t been demonstrated and also including a highly questionable characterisation: I think to make Jesus an Aryan is both factually wrong and against the core of Christianity (if not Jew, then no Messiah), hence anti-Christian, I can see that it is motivated by anti-Semitism but I can’t see that the view itself is anti-semitic. Anyway, the paragraph adds nothing substantial to the section.</li>
<li>The text says that „Hitler writes of his Christian influence on his view of Jews“, but the following quote does not warrant such an introduction, as Hitler does not write on this Christian influence (the text of course implies against NPOV that there are such influences. The quote is an example of the reinterpretation of Jesus as an anti-Jewish hero and of the reinterpretation of the crucifixion, ridding it of any redemptive value. (FACT)</li>
</ul>
<p>As I said, there are in the “Gio/Drogo version” various instances of an unfinished text and I went all the way last week trying to include the Mein Kampf quotes into the text where it fitted best IMHO. My work simply got reverted.</p>
<p>It contains various violations of NPOV by endorsing certain statements, stating things as facts that are highly debatable or even outright false, putting things into question that are undisputed, rewriting to play down unsuitable facts, highlighting a certain point via technical edits (block quotes) and by repeating it over and over again.</p>

<dl>
<dd>I do not strongly object but I question the need to include what others in the area believe as being relevant to Hitler. Far more relevant is the beliefs that young Adolf was raised with, in particular those who rasied him---his parents beliefs, which by all accounts was sincere and devout, strict, even. It seems the purpose of emphasising "nothing special" serves to undermine the sincereity of the fact that Hitler was raised a fully practicing Catholic, as it pushes the idea that his family was just following the norm, since that was what everyone else did. That is like if a Christian professes their Christianity, and then we comment, "but ofcourse he is a Christian---people are rasied Christian in that areas where he comes from." It acts as a dismissive remark to the beliefs held by the person professing, and is not really relevant to their beliefs. So what if it was common to be rasied a Christian in the area---that is not important. What is important, in this regard, is how the individual in question is rasied--not how others in the area are. But, I wonder, did the majority of children in the area become a choir boy, and be as involved in the Church to the degreee that Hitler's parents had him involved--to the extent that Hitler himself considered joining the clergy himself? I think while most were Catholic, his mother is noted for being an esp. devout one. <a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 21:11, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>- So you want it said that he was brought up in a Roman Catholic area, but you don't want it said that his parents where Roman Catholic? That is illogical, and plain arbitrary. Its more important to state what a person's parents believe, than what people in the area where he was brought up believe, as the primary determining factor in what a person believes as a child, is what his parents tell him. Perhaps this is why you object, you don't want people to infer that at any time in his life, Hitler himself was a devout Catholic?

<dd>I agree that Hitler was influenced by pan-german thinking and social dwarinism (Not real Darwinism!), but this is about his nationalist and racist ideology, part of his fascism, and in particular Nazism (as well as imperialism)--not his religious beliefs so it does not belong in this section. Hitler did inflused these ideas into his Christianity, using the latter as a basic framework, and borrowing Christian ideas that are shared with Nazism as a political religion (blind faith, no questions, emotion not reason, etc), and his nationalist, racist ideas are mixed in his interpretation of Christianity--but that is already make clear in the MK quotes Str1977 keeps taking out. They show Hitler's Christian thinking as it is infused in his racist beliefs (that Jesus was not a Jew, but an Aryan, for example). Social Dwarinsim is not Hitler's religion, and so your wanting to including it correctly opposed as inflating the section and distracting from the subject it should be focused on.<a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 21:25, 17 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>First a note: my first version had "social darwinism" (SD), which was wrong. Rissmann talks about Darwinism in general. SD was of course part of the parcel but the main way this influence worked that Hitler couldn't reconcile the Genesis account with the findings of Darwin's theory of evolution. I don't think such a thought should be foreign to you, Gio. So Hitler felt a contradiction which result in him doubting both the Bible and the Church and this doubt of course is essential for his further views.</dd>
<dd>Unfortunaltey, Gio, you cannot help exposing either your hate of or your ignorance about Christianity by labeling as Christian things that are not elements of Christianity let alone specifically Christian ones): "blind faith, no questions, emotion not reason". And, since you haven't yet understood, if Jesus is not a Jew, he is not the Messiah. So your reiteration of this makes clear what Hitler wasn't. It is also a violation of RC doctrine and hence Hitler wasn't a Catholic.</dd>
<dd>I am not taking out the unreferenced MK quotes (I only integrated them into the text). No one claims that SD was Hitler's religion, I am only saying that Darwinism played an important role in his intellectual development. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 14:00, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It seems I'm more familiar with the nature of your own religion than you are. You claim these things are not elements of Christianity, which is interting since they clearly are. I don't want to distract from the purpose of this talk page by proving to you that at its core it is about blind faith, irrationality, emotion not reason, and not to question, etc. There are lots of quotes that show this, including from leaders within the Catholic Church who demand this. That is easily done, if you insist, on your own personal page. But, Hitler certainly recognized these elements of Christianity and happily used them as means to further control and manipulate his religious followers, by incorporating and emphasising these religious practices into his politics. This is not just me saying this, but the historian Michael Burleigh, The Third Reich: A New History, (New York: Hill and Wang, 2000). In a review of the book here,<a href="http://www.brothersjudd.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/reviews.detail/book_id/382" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.brothersjudd.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/reviews.detail/book_id/382" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, the point is made: "In one of the more striking quotes in the book, one that Hoffer would have noted, Burleigh cites Hitler favorably discussing Roman Catholicism: "Be assured, we too put faith in the first place and not cognition. One has to be able to believe in a cause. Only faith creates a state. What motivates people to go and do battle and die for religious ideas? Not cognition, but blind faith." Burleigh argued Nazism as a political religion:<a href="http://www.cosmopolis.ch/english/cosmo12/burleigh.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cosmopolis.ch/english/cosmo12/burleigh.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></dd>
<dd>Your view of Hitlers version of Christianity, to you, means he was not a Catholic, but again that is your opinion. Others disagree. I would agree he certainly was not Orthodox, but instead of either of us trying to say what we think he is, I say let the sources and fact they report speak for themselves. This is not only the way to solve the dispute here but its the policy of Wikipedia that requires it. Finally Darwinism may have played a role in Hitlers thinking, this section should only focus on his religious views. <a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 20:54, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Gio, not all “my opinion” – the Catholic Church defines what belonging to her requires and if someone doesn’t live up to that he cannot be counted as a practising Catholic. It is as simple as that and no “opinion” on my part involved. You are also misrepresenting your stance in the debate as you are far from restricting yourself to the sources (if such a thing were actually possible). Regarding the “focus on his religious views” I generally agree but … you have come to this position rather recently since you opposed it when I objected to your inclusion of “merely anti-semitic issues”. Now, that a part of your belief system (judging from the Gould quote) is affected you change your mind. However, Darwinism played a part in Hitler’s intellectual biography (leading to his rejection of the faith) and also played a large role (through Social Darwinism) throughout his life – even in the bunker he talked about how the German race had failed to succeed in the “fight for life” and hence should now perish.

<dd>Gio probably ought to read Burleigh's book rather than depending on reviews. The quotation from Burleigh's book (p. 100) does not say that he favorably discussed Roman Catholicism, rather than he admired certain characteristics of Catholicism --blind obedience, dogmatism, and fanaticism. However, Hitler wanted those three things in service of himself, not the Roman Catholic Church. Hitler was catholic (small "c") in his willingness to adopt strategies of persuasion. He even admires Marxist propaganda in <cite>Mein Kampf</cite>, though that probably doesn't make him a Marxist. <a href="../../../b/y/t/User%7EBytwerk_263a.html" title="User:Bytwerk">Bytwerk</a> 21:21, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, this is basically my understanding, as well. We don't really disagree: Hitler admired and used certain elements of Catholicism for political reasons, and he did detest other aspects for political reasons as well. But this is not unique in the history of Christianity or Catholicism. The Emperor Constantine fashioned central religious ideas and doctrines and rejected other doctrines for political reasons, as well---in merging the Roman Empire with the Church in a devine union, with Constantine as a new "Moses." Hitler is no different in this respect. He wanted to mold the Church and change it to suit his political needs of empire, and control.<a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 05:09, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks, Gio, you have stated here that Hitler wasn’t a Catholic since “he did detest other aspects” – if you reject an aspect of Catholicism you are not a Catholic, even more so if you even “detest” it. Quite apart from the fact that the things he rejected/detested are the core of the faith while the other elements are merely matters of form or not even elements of Catholicism at all (e.g. your favourite “blind obedience”). <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 22:38, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is an opinion still because it involves ones notion of what it takes to be labeled definitively a "practicing" or "not practicing" Catholic. If we stuck to the facts only, we would only state which actions Hitler took or did not take, according to sources. We have that info, but that is not good enough for Str. He wants to sum it up with the label for the readers, which is where the original research (and opinion) comes into play. There is not always a clear line between fact and opinion. Different people can look at the same set of facts and disagree regarding the imposition of such a label, just like many Catholics can regard themselves as practicing Christians even though they don't attend Mass anymore. There are many ways to practice, and not to practice in some ways does not necessarily make one "non-practicing" in an aboslute way, as is implied. I know there are different sects within the Catholic Church, and some such as Opus Dei, which do require regular mass attendence, sizable money contributions from your regular paycheck, and other obligations in order to be a practicing member. Ohters are less strict, less demanding. If we have a source that says Hitler "did not practice Catholicism" after he left home, then we can put that in as a fact as long as we properly attribute the source.<a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 20:40, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Gio, that is what an encyclopedia is all about: summing up facts. Otherwise we would not need any policies. Also, you clearly have no clue about history – not only because all your remarks (here or otherwise) betray it but because you want to only state the facts – that is impossible. But in fact you don’t even want to do that as you want to hide the facts unpleasant to you. Hitler, after leaving home, had no religious life in the Catholic sense and attended Church only for his mother’s burial. That is a fact and not a matter of opinion. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 22:38, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Drogo. Str, if you have a source that says this, then by all means include it. However, you have no such source. It is your POV, which is fine but should not be included in the article. Be happy with the facts as they are known and reported by various sources qualified in this subject matter. You are not allowed to connect the dots and state your own conclusion about the meaning of the facts, esp. when its not clear to me and other editors that your conclusion is valid. As I've said before "not practicing" suggestings a complete abandonment of any and all forms of practice, which we know is not true.

This way a reader can get a sense of what the scholars think about the question. The more POV's the better as that gives a sense of the current thinking and consensus of the question. Just leaving it to bare facts will trim it down significantly, but it would be dull. The idea is not to remove all POV, but to make sure its done in a NPOV manner (all POV's) and that the sources for these POV's are up to standards and notable, so they can be included. I have no doubt in my mind that the only reason Str wants this removed is because its a POV he does not agree with. Speculation is stating a POV, in weak terms. So, he should be happy about that. Im sure if the author stated as a fact that Hitler was talking about Catholicism, as a fact ,he'd be even more unhappy and still want it removed.<a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 21:10, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Much as you like to portray Wikipedia as simply reporting what everyone says, that's not actually the way it works.

<dd>I disagree. I think we should include all POV's, provided they are POVs clearly stated as POV's, and ofcourse, only if those are POV's articulated by reputable experts in the field. Contrary to what you say, there is a big difference between what our POV's are (which don't matter here), and the respective authorities within academia who are qualified to speak on the matter. Their POV matters. It is not fact, which is fine as long as it says "according to..." This way a reader can get a sense of what the scholars think about the question. The more POV's the better as that gives a sense of the current thinking and consensus of the question. Just leaving it to bare facts will trim it down significantly, but it would be dull. The idea is not to remove all POV, but to make sure its done in a NPOV manner (all POV's) and that the sources for these POV's are up to standards and notable, so they can be included. I have no doubt in my mind that the only reason Str wants this removed is because its a POV he does not agree with. Toland is a notable historian and writer on Adolf Hitler. His view of Hitler's religion and what he reports is valid for inclusion in the article. I oppose censoring his relevant statement. And, for the record, his view is not alone.<a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 21:18, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Colonel, sources and historians play a valid role in this but even historians can write nonsensical statements (see Steigmann). We also should use the best historians and Toland is not among them, while Kershaw is the current pinnacle of Hitler biography. If there is a real dispute between historians we should report on it including all views in a NPOV, but if there is no dispute we give the consensus of historical scholarship.

This was Hitler's belief and it should be correctly and fairly characterized, according to reputable sources. That is all this does. The passage is both notable for Hilter's anti-semitism as it is for his religious conceptions, since his is talking about what he believes was the creation of God. When Hilter talks about God, Str1977, he is talking about religious belief--even if his religious beliefs of God involve his anti-semitism. Or do you think God doesnt mean God here but he is only talking about his belief of Jews?

<dd>Members of other religions could have said it, but they didn't---Hitler said it. Hitler, who was raised a Catholic and continued to profess and demonstrate his Christian thinking in various ways said it. According to Steigmann-Gall this is one way in which Hitler was showing his Christian thinking. I don't find that nonsensical at all. The idea that Hitler could have been talking as a Jew or Muslim--now that would be nonsense (which is why no one says it or thinks such a notion is even plausable). Clearly, the religious beliefs are in the context of the known facts of his religious affiliatoin and membership: Christianity. But whatever you think, whatever I think, or others editors happen think really doesn't matter since this article is not about what we think about Hitler's religious belief.

<dd>That's being unnecessarily obscure Giovanni. Of course if we were already sure that Hitler was a Christian then we would know that he was talking about the Christian God. But since we are not - in fact since that is the whole thing we are trying to decide - we can't use the fact that he used a phrase which could have been said from many different religious viewpoints as evidence that he was a Christian. It's a circular argument.

Its perfectly clear to me that Hitler was a Christian. All the known facts point to that.

Gio, if you think that this passage adds no useful info to the section, as your above post seems to imply (when you actually think through your point) then we can always drop it. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 22:38, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>The following paragraph is completely sinking to the level of being a table of contents fort he Steinmann book: „Elsewhere in Mein Kampf, he says, Hitler makes references to Jesus. Other sources also show Hitler's Christian thinking, according to Steigmann-Gall. He notes an unpublished manuscript where Hitler sketched out his world-view, and he gives as an example a speech on April 1922 where Hitler said that Jesus was "the true God". Finally, Steigmann-Gall gives another example where in a private Nazi meeting Hitler again stated the centrality of Jesus' teachings to the Nazi movement.“</b></li>

<li><b>„Hitler's religious beliefs demonstrated the anti-Semitic view that Jesus was an Aryan rather than a Jew“ is both claiming something that hasn’t been demonstrated and also including a highly questionable characterisation: I think to make Jesus an Aryan is both factually wrong and against the core of Christianity (if not Jew, then no Messiah), hence anti-Christian, I can see that it is motivated by anti-Semitism but I can’t see that the view itself is anti-semitic.

<dd>No, it again means I have better things to do than try to sort out your opinions and separate them from legitimate criticisms of the article. You write, "I think to make Jesus an Aryan is both factually wrong and against the core of Christianity". Who cares what you think? You are not a source. It is a fact that Hitler called Jesus an Aryan, and that is all that the sentence is saying, it is not saying that Jesus really was an Aryan. <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDrogo_Underburrow_7294.html" title="User:Drogo Underburrow">Drogo Underburrow</a> 07:24, 21 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Leaving aside the incivility and unnecessary hostility of your response, Drogo, I will point out that I am a qualified English teacher with several degrees and diplomas (undergraduate and postgraduate) in English, Linguistics, and Language Studies, currently working on a doctorate, and have experience both in teaching English as a Foreign Language and in lecturing undergraduate (native-speaker) university students in academic writing. I don't know what your background is, as you don't give any indication on your user page, but I think I am in at least as good a position as you to comment on the prose style of other editors, though I generally consider it in rather poor taste to do so. Apart from the slightly unusual use of the preposition "on" with "write" (and that could be a typo for "of", just as you have a typo in "defering" [<i>sic.</i>]), and the fact that he forgot to close a bracket (how shocking!), I find nothing "poorly written" in his objection. If it makes little sense to you, that may be from a problem in your background knowledge rather than in his English. Let me see if I can put it into simpler English for you:
<ul>
<li>To say that Hitler "writes of his Christian influence" (rather than that he writes that Christianity influences him) carries an implication that there is indeed such an influence. That violates NPOV, as there are many who dispute it.</li>
<li>The quotation does not show a Christian influence, so the introduction (i.e. the line beginning with "Hitler writes of") is not appropriate.</li>
<li>The quotation does not show the Christian interpretation of Jesus's love and concern for the Jews (see, for example Luke 13:34), but implies that He resented them. Also, there is nothing in the Bible to imply that He drove the traders out of the temple because they were Jews. That is a complete distortion of the passage in John.</li>
<li>The quotation distorts the Christian understanding of Christ's death, reinterpreting it as a result of opposition to Jews, rather than as the purpose for which He came into the world — i.e. the redemption of the human race.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>If there is still anything that you don't understand, perhaps you could point to it without engaging in personal remarks. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 20:55, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Apart from these more thorough points raised by Ann, I want to reiterate: the passage does not say what the introductory sentence claims, it neither talks about the Hitler’s Christian influence nor is it a quote in which Hitler says he was influenced by Christianity. The only thing it shows is what I have written above and which I have included into “my overhauled version”. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 22:38, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>As I said, there are in the “Gio/Drogo version” various instances of an unfinished text and I went all the way last week trying to include the Mein Kampf quotes into the text where it fitted best IMHO. My work simply got reverted.</b></li>
<li><b>It contains various violations of NPOV by endorsing certain statements, stating things as facts that are highly debatable or even outright false, putting things into question that are undisputed, rewriting to play down unsuitable facts, highlighting a certain point via technical edits (block quotes) and by repeating it over and over again</b></li>

<dd>Hallo guys, unfortunately I have to go on Wiki-break for the next two days. I'll be back after that and comment on what has transpired here. Right now I just want to say that I don't understand the vitriol spread by some editors. I want to thank those that responded kindly, even if criticially. Finally, let me point out that I have no objection against keeping the section as short as possible. Yes, this is an encyclopedia article and it should be composed as such. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 11:10, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
