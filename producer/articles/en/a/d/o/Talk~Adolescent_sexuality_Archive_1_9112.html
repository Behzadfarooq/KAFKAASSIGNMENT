<p>I've greatly reduced the length of the "sexuality" section in <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolescence.html" title="Adolescence">Adolescence</a> -- it's sloppy and runs the risk of a <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_fork_623c.html" title="POV fork">POV fork</a> to have such a lengthy treatment of a subject in a subsection when a separate article also exists. However, I have reproduced the old section below so that editors can mine it for any material that is not also in <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolescent_sexuality.html" title="Adolescent sexuality">Adolescent sexuality</a> now.</p>

<p>Exactly!, in Europe and Japan as far as I know Adolescent sex is HARDLY an issue. Although in order to get a good idea of their views we'll need some peeps from Europe and other parts of the globe to do some editing on this.</p>
<p>I myself am American so.... well, yeah. Although I have some Israeli friends who might be able to contribute a tiny bit or more, i'll see if they're willing to help out.</p>
<p>No one i know from any other place though, sry... But i never did realize it WAS highly US centric until now. Damn is this topic a US culture war.... ech *shudders*.</p>
<p>I'll be removing some POV statements and links however, and i'm GLAD that this is part of wikiproject sexuality, that's quite a good category. It might even expand coverage of this topic and help straigten out POV statements.</p>

<p>I am lodging a formal complaint about the user illuminato.</p>
<p>Why?, because he IS ALWAYS inserting every possible kind of weasel word, POV statement, and he CONSISTENTLY reverts changes made by me and other people back to a HIGHLY POV state.</p>
<p>I am stating this now.</p>
<p>I request that Illuminato be BANNED from editing Wikipedia for a while at least. Due to his constant unwillingness to allow ANY sort of lettering into wikipedia other than his own biased views.</p>
<p>This has been glaringly obvious to me in the articles on</p>
<p>Adolescence, namely the adolescent sexuality section. And the new article created on Adolescent sexuality. Which he has CONSTANTLY been reverting back into an incredibly biased state with sources from 2 year old single day of printing newspapers, use of HIGHLY DUBIOUS sources to back up his OBVIOUSLY POV statements and claims which he injects, and how he HAS ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS disregarded the requests and wishes of me and other people on wikipedia in order to revert and basically vandalize articles so they reflect a TOTALLY BIASED POV,</p>
<p>I am sick and tired of this and will go into a revert war if need be until this gets fixed as HARDLY ANYTHING has managed to be accomplished with his constant interference which DOES NOTHING I repeat... NOTHING to help the article out whatsoever...... Although i am asking help from my fellow wikipedians n solving this issue and perhaps calling up a moderation committee person.</p>
<p>If you check over the discussions and histories on these two articles I am sure you will CLEARLY see the point of contention.</p>
<p>also, i will place a copy of this in Illuminato's talk page so that he knows what my allegations against him are, i am sick and tired of thiss silliness ans i hope it stops here.</p>
<p>NOTE: Illuminato's edit said fixing up the front part of the topic.... except it was basically reverted. now THAT is what REALLY annoys me, lying in order to rebias an article which is ALREADY in dire need of improvement.</p>
<p>I hope my wishes are at least considered or met.</p>

<p>I admit that at first i ddin't keep my cool, HOWEVER, Illuminato HAS BEEN doing all of what i mentioned and I DID NOT DELETE the entire article.... (at least as far as i can remember). In the beggining of my joining this site a couple of weeks ago i DID delete the adolescent sexuality section of the article on adolescence but that was ONLY because of how shocked and angered I was by the countless amounts of POV in it at that time.</p>
<p>And i am STILL trying to make it less POV of <i>but</i> <a href="../../../i/l/l/User%7EIlluminato_0afe.html" title="User:Illuminato">user:Illuminato</a> has been causing A LOT of trouble for me and the other people who have been revising this article... he might be 'polite' but if you look closely you'll SEE he IS NOT following the wikipedia guidelines..</p>
<p>Do you REALLY think that the January 25th or so edition of the 2005 U.S. world and news report is a good reference?, how many people do you think still have it to easily review?. And you can't say that using a two or so year old monthly magazine article is an easily peer accissible reference EITHER. And yes, i am trying to make it NPOV, and when i rearranged it into a format that was more conducive to a NPOV way and added the OTHER major point of view (The POV that says adolescent sexuality isn't all that bad..) Illuminato called it Nambla material and promptly deleted it.</p>
<p>HE DOES NOT post on the board before making changes, I and the others DO! and if you look at his record <a href="../../../j/e/c/User%7EJecowa_587b.html" title="User:Jecowa">User:Jecowa</a> I am CERTAIN that you will see how he has CONSSITENTLY done endless reverts in order to keep the major points of view that don't agree adolescent sex is horrible down at the bottom or deleted (Which he consistently does).</p>
<p>Why stick up for him if you don't view his records?, YES in the start my own changes were not so bright, but i HAD JUST JOINED wikipedia.... duuuuuhhhh. Do you <i>really</i> expect a person who'd been editing on wikipedia for 2 days to know EVERYTHING?.</p>
<p>P.S. and Illuminato has called many things he's done MINOR but they turn out to be apparent cover ups for rearranging, deleting, and POV'ing entire sections. Several paragraph summaries?</p>
<p>Ok, this one is for Illuminato.</p>
<p>A. you CREATED the article on adolescent sexuality.</p>
<p>B. the text in the adolescent sexuality section is IDENTICAL to that of the article.</p>
<p>C. Despite my attempts to fix that and make it into a summary you have REPEATEDLY reverted it.</p>
<p>D. why in the hell would you do all of the above?, as someone in the adolescent sexuality article talk said. "Sounds like a duplication of efforts to me"</p>
<p>no offense but you need to set your brainwaves to the tune.</p>

<p>Could someone explain why the link to this article which i put in the main article on adolescence was moved?. I don't see any reason that it doesn't belong... in fact, if the sexuality sectino of that article ever DOES become an unbiased summary than having the link to this article would.. in my opinion and i think many others would agree, be a neccissity</p>

<p>I added links and put the copied information into CLEAR quotationd.</p>
<p>I believe that the link to siecus is allowed for informational purposes.</p>
<p>I did copy a bunhc of extra info accidently because the damn reference link screwed up, but THIS is the link to the page. Ask before reverting, you're giving me the impression you just don't like what i'm adding to wikipedia (Which is quite valid information)</p>

<p>If you could restore my edit and fix the above reference link to not copy the entire siecus page that would be highly appreicated and MUCH better than just reverting it using 'popups'</p>

<p>The study data which I added IS from the public domain or is granted for educational use I am pretty sure, if you want me to paraphrase it then tell me so and I will, just don't suddenly revert it,</p>
<p>If the centers for disease control publishes data then it is AUTOMATICALLY in the public domain, the siecus website just has a brief summary of the data STRAIGHT from those study reports.</p>
<p>And the KFF data i am fairly sure is usable under fair use, that should be the only thing i would have to paraphrase.</p>

<p>So if i were to paraphrase the 2000 seventeen magazine and KFF survey and add the link it would be acceptable?.</p>
<p>And</p>
<p>I can't seem to find the YRBS info on the CDC website (There's a LOT of pdf's etc. with YEARS of YRBS data, perhaps you could help?, it's the 2001 YRBS) but if i were to find it and cut &amp; paste from the CDC website that data THEN that would be ok as well correct?, since the CDC is a federal agency anything it publishes goes right into the public domain.</p>

<p>I've paraphrased the KFF source, and dug up the 2005 CDC YRBS study and have 'injected' that into my additions, HOWEVER. I will get some more study and CDC data straight from the sources and THIS time i will check out the copyright policies&#160;:-)</p>
<p>It should be fixed up a fair amount by sunday, depends on my speed of editing.</p>
<p>And as a note to Illuminato:</p>
<p>DON'T go about deleting what i put in and call it 'formatting references and spelling' like you did in the other article, if you want it taken out then DISCUSS it here, although I think that even <i>you</i> won't find this too disagreeable, (You still get your nice little globs of Leonard Sax 'data' wayyy up top, mainly because i'm sick of arguing over it at the moment and want to fix up this article a bit more before seeing if you'll actually agree to making it not so POV'D,</p>
<p>(note, the note to Illuminato IS simply my opinion and a little note to him telling him not to mess with what i put in, as he has done in the past, this goes for everyone else to, i'm SICK of reversions based on POV) <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENateland_dd34.html" title="User:Nateland">Nateland</a> 10:11, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Nateland, I have already asked you to be more careful in your edits on your talk page. You made a number of mistakes in your edits here again, so I ask you here to take greater care when you edit so that these major mistakes are not made. For instance, you changed the quote in the lead but kept quotation marks around it. You can NOT change quotes like that. Quotes indicate that what is between them is a verbatim account. When you substitute your words you are giving the impression that someone said something they didn't. You also did this with a sentence I wrote, but ascribed it to Dr. Sax. You can't put my words in his mouth.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Your data on why teens engage in sexual intercourse was flawed several ways. First, it <i>may</i> have come from Seventeen magazine originally, but thats not where you found it. You found it on the Sexuality Information and Education Council's website. You need to say so. Further, you miss cited the data you found there. It was not 51% of 12-17 year olds who had sex because they found the right person, it was 51% of 15-17 year olds. Furthermore, 'Risky Business is not a book, it is the name of a story in U.S. News &amp; World Report. While discussing this article I should also point out that the author is a journalist writing for a news publication. If she has personal views on adolescent sexuality she keeps them to herself in the article. You can not claim, as you did, to know what she thinks on the subject.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, again many of your edits are poor grammatically and contain numerous misspellings of words. You have fragmented sentences, subjects and verbs don't match, single sentence paragraphs, etc. You even had a whole section that consisted of a single sentence. You messed up this sentence anyway, as one half of it came from the US News story but you put gave Dr. Sax attribution for it. Like you can't change peoples words inside quotes you certainly can not take comments from two different people, put them in a single quote, and give someone else authorship of it.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>Please be more careful, Nateland. It will make for a better experince for all readers and all editors. --<a href="../../../i/l/l/User%7EIlluminato_0afe.html" title="User:Illuminato">Illuminato</a> 19:57, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Anon called them reckless and asked me to bring changes to talk page, which I had already done. I kept all the content that was verifiable, and even some that wasn't properly sourced, and didn't delete anything substantive.

<p>i'll guess that it's U.S. centric, however i don't know exactly if it is US centric or not....

<p>Could we get someone down here to assess this article? It would be greatly appreciated in solving a few things...</p>
<p>Oh yes, I find that while this article is being slowly reworked into something doable, the 'summary' on the main article about adolescence ITSELF is...</p>
<p>well, IN need of much reworking, though I will wait to get some other people's input, It's been sitting there in the adolescent sexuality section of the article for a couple of weeks now with NO changes whatsoever.... And I think that it either needs to be made into a NPOV summary, or lengthened to include all of the CURRENT adolescent sexuality article.</p>
<p>(Well, i'd go for making it into an NPOV conforming summary) But this is my opinion and I think that we should divert some focus to that issue.</p>

<dd>Working on it. I am working on a complete and utter re-write of the article now, such that it can be verified. However, I am running into issues finding unbiased sources of information—everyone has their slant on this subject. That is rather frustrating. I have been working on this for a few hours now, though, and I have a draft of a new article in my user space, but I need to find <b>way</b> more information before I can replace this article with it. —Mike Trausch (<a href="../../../f/d/0/User%7EFd0man_734b.html" title="User:Fd0man">fd0man</a>, <a href="../../../f/d/0/User_talk%7EFd0man_b202.html" title="User talk:Fd0man">Talk Page</a>) 19:58, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Meh. Allow me to restate that—I need to find more <b>references</b> to information that is viable and within our standards here.

<dd>I agree, that's why whewn i first started editing the adolescent sexuality articles (or section because at that time it was a sectioni n thwe main article on adolescence) I lost my cool, I think however that the references and quotations from Leonard Sax should go, as Illuminato, who just recklessly deleted entire portions of this article (I had to revert and he messed up some revisions i had made due to my getting an edit conflict message) has NOT posted ANY of Leonard Sax's sources of information, yet he conitnuoualy tries to keep as much of his info in their as possible, and I havn't been able to get y hands on the book yet.</dd>

<p>sigh... I have tried to improve this article, and if you want the source of it all check out the main article on adolescence (There were also disputes in the adolescent pshychology article over Illuminato's addtions), I have tried to keep my cool for some time but Illuminato has been conssitently giving me problems, yes.. when I first joined wikipedia i acted pretty uncivil, but I tink that right now I am not doing the wrong thing, he deleted LOADS of information (For the upteenth time) and has done so again and again and again, I have TRIED ... (Believe me) to settle this but he won't budge, I know maybe i don't budge that much either but at least i am allowing him to keep a LOT of his stuff in the article, while he simply deletes whatever i put in their or formats it so that it is nearly invisible to the eye.</p>
<p>Like I said.. check out the history and discussion on the main article on adolescence. <i>(I mean, Illuminato CREATED the article on adolescent sexuality, why would he continuously delete entire sections which haven't met objections, are correctly paraphrase, and just go on trying to keep it as much an exact copy of the sexuality section in the article on adolescent as possible?)</i></p>
<p>He comes across to Me as simply using requests for politeness and warnings as an umbrella to continue degrading wikipedia. I'm all FOR editing and expanding articles and improving them, but when only ONE side of an issue is allowed to stay, and TONS of viewpoints come from one man and are kept there via edit warring...</p>

<p>Ok here's the deal bucko, I clearly cited my sources and so far NO ONE but YOU has disagreed with them, you have deleted ENTIRE SECTIONS 2 TIMES in the last few minutes and If you continue to do so i will report you for a 3 revert rule violation.</p>
<p>Ask Fd0man or any of the other people who helped me correctly paraphrase and reference the siecus and other information, you have NO RIGHT to go about deleting other peoples contributions by the truckload, I've been on wikipedia for less than a month and even I know that.</p>
<p>I will revert the article back to its state before your reckless editing, if you 'edit' it again and fail to discuss it with ALL of us beforehand then i will report you.</p>

<dd>Nateland, as I discussed above, I did not delete any of your proper content. I just reformatted some of it and made it easier to read, but <b>none</b> of the data you provided was removed. In fact, it was good data and I commend you for finding it. However, the version you keep reverting to has several <b>major</b> problems with it. You change quotes, provide incorrect attributions, misspell words, etc. The whole idea of wikipedia is that it is something anyone can edit. I have every right to edit this article in order to clean it up. Please read my above comments and the version of the article I have again reverted back to so that you can see for yourself that all your data was included.

<p>Just so you know, my HTML skills are as basic as can be, I normally have to take a couple of tries to get a reference tag right, and I simply changed the quotes because I saw that according to the flow of the article that they'd be better in other sections of the article, I also have had to take a couple shots to get the CDC 2005 YRBS study data ontrack as my computer messed up a few times and impeded my drafting up revisions for this article. And no, I am not an expert speller, maybe You are, and if so than feel Free to fix any speling mistaks I make and improve the article further, and the atributions was a whole paraphrasing misunderstanding on my part early this morning which I corrected.</p>
<p>You see, you can't just delete entire sections because of major problems.. the studies are listed correctly, so if they don't fit... Then just find the correctl inks on the web. Believe me, I tried to make sure the refs were right, and to my knowledge they were. You can blame me all you want for the above mistakes, but instead of deleting it, try and IMPROVE it!!! ( That's what I am rying to do nowadays, and I hope you'll do the same on this article)</p>
<p>Yes.. .I know that this topic is a point of contention, but we can't make it solely or vastly or POVly opinionated, if we include opinions, then we mark them up equally as certain peoples views and try to format them accordingly to this simple guideline, and CDC and KFF study data isn't even a summary of someones opinion, it's pure mathematically represented statistical data which Might be showing that teens aren't engaging in sex 'mindlessly and mind numbingly' as one of your experts put it, but That's a GOOD thing right?, to show that condom usage is going up, and that adolescents are not just making love for the heck of it or to piss off their parents or whatever. Unless someone is raped or coerce, people have sex because they WANT to, it's part of life, and I don't see how including accurate easily peer accessible information on that topic is such a bad thing.</p>
<p>Correct me if i'm wrong.</p>

<p>Nateland, you keep adding a Weasel Words template to the article. Instead of continued bickering, why don't you point out some instances of these weasel words. Then, you and I can join with whomever else is interested and we can fix them. It is a small project that hopefully we can work together on them and engender some good will. If you place the statements with weasel words here on the talk page we can work on them to remove the weasel words, and then fix it in the article. Sound good? --<a href="../../../i/l/l/User%7EIlluminato_0afe.html" title="User:Illuminato">Illuminato</a> 21:16, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The first thing i did when I saw your name on the history with no explanation whatsoever was to compare edits.</p>
<p>Guess what I found? You <i>did</i> delete a lot of my data, and other peoples contributions as well.... While some of it might have been additional info on other organizations who are of opposing views to Lynn Ponton, Leonard sax etc. they were only put there to try and eqaul out the balance, with people stating views AGAINST adolescent sexuality being kept WAAYYY up top in the article, and only one tiny little author being mentioned as a 'minority' view, It compells me to try and make it more even so people, when reading the article... will have information they want and/or need to make a decision if they havn't done so already or arej ust looking for a good encyclopedia article to help them with a delimma etc. (Trust me, this is the other MAJOR side of the debate, while there might not be many people who share that view, they still make up roughly the other half of the debate, so they SHOULD be included in full, or at least a little bit more then a scanty reference)</p>
<p>So I hope that you can see my concerns Illuminato, and while I will try to be as civil as possible, You should learn to be a little bit giving to other view points in the article, i mean?, is deleting a rough summary of the 3 major organizations that make up the opposing view points REALLY a valid deletion?.</p>
<p>Because doing so just biases the article even more and makes you look like you're pushing your own agenda as you have seemed to do many times in the past, Besides.. all I WANT you to do is to provide some of Leonard sax's OWN sources online, because even a book by a so called 'expert' can be filled with not a single bit of scientific od statistical or even USEFUL data except relegious and moral statements.</p>
<p>All you have to do is just look in the references page in the back of the book, and try to find some links to his 'evidence' online.</p>
<p>I will try to get time to buy the book, but the Least you can do is do the above and make it easily peer accessible... That's all I want, then, if the studies seem NPOV enough and don't come from a small town survey, then I won't complain.</p>
<p>The End.</p>

<dd>I looked at their websites, and found for the most part they advocate giving teens more information. My quick review of SIECUS and the Advocates for Youth websites didn't really seem to be saying that adolescent sex is a god thing. In fact, I found that SIECUS' official position is that "Adolescents should be encouraged to delay sexual behaviors until they are physically, cognitively, and emotionally ready for mature sexual relationships and their consequences. ..." I think these groups could be of more use to the sex education artilce. Judith Levine does advocate in favor of free sex for children and teens, so I kept her in. I don't have Dr. Sax's book anymore. I have returned it to the library. When I get back there I'll try to check it out again, but it was a featured book (thats how I came across it) and I imagine the wait list is still in effect. I would encourage you to go out and read the book yourself. You can then look up the sources yourself. --<a href="../../../i/l/l/User%7EIlluminato_0afe.html" title="User:Illuminato">Illuminato</a> 21:41, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The reply i made just before this one should lay everything out pretty much. And The advocates for youth ARE adovcates for allowing adolescents to have sex, they have PAGES saying how it's ok as long as condoms etc. are used, and SIECUS might be in favor of abistinence, but their link I kept in to support the KFF and Seventeen Magazine survey of the 510 kids aged 12-17, I couldn't find the original KFF source on their website or on google, so I used the SIECUS one as data to show that there is evidence CONTRARY to Leonard Sax's opinions that sex is just a casual hook up.</p>
<p>And that evidence simply told the percentages of teens that had responded WHY they had sex, the vast majority of which said they thought 'They had met the right person". Perfectly Acceptable to this article I think.</p>
<p>Besides, this is data STRAIGHT from the adolescents themselves, and i'm not quite sure if Leonard sax got his straight from teenagers by interviewing them or using a comparable method. It's simply study data which holds the views of adolescents themselves in an article all ABOUT adolescents.</p>

<p>_________________________________________________ "Teens - and preteens - are too young to fathom the consequences, both physical and emotional, of their [sexual] behavior."[4] According to Lynn Ponton, a professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco and author of The Sex Lives of Teenagers, "early initiation into sexual behaviors [takes] a toll on teens' mental health. The result, she says, can be 'dependency on boyfriends and girlfriends, serious depression around breakups and cheating, [and a] lack of goals.'"[4] As adolescents are not mentally or emotionally prepared to handle feelings and emotions that come with sex, nor financially able to support children, "early sexual activity - whether in or out of a romantic relationship - does far more harm than good."[5]</p>
<p>A minority, including journalist Judith Levine, believes that sexual activity among adolescents and even children is natural and causes little to no harm if contraception is used. She believes that since humans are sexual beings that even the smallest children will most likely end up taking part in sex rehearsal play with other children out of their own explorations and that it causes no harm.[6]</p>
<p>_________________________________________________________-- Human sexual behavior generally and adolescent sexual behavior in most individuals is typically influenced, or heavily affected by norms from the culture in which the individual lives. Examples of such norms are prohibitions on sexual intercourse before marriage, against homosexual sexual activity, or other taboo activities, because the religion or culture to which the individual belongs forbids them. Sometimes individuals choose not to ascribe to culturally or religious imposed norms.</p>
<p>The text inside the dashed lines is a MAJOR thing i think we need to clean up ASAP. You see, that is a U.S centric gropu of opinions from both sides of a U.S. centric issue with U.S sources. If this article is on world adolescent sexuality (As I think it has been consensually declared as such)</p>
<p>Then I think we need to go along with my earlier post which you reverted and put that in a general United states section like i had on my edits before you reverted it.</p>
<p>THEN underneath we put in the 3 categories, experiences of adolescents during sex If applicable, (this might be a bit hard to gather data on as easily peer accessible sources for this subtopic, are scarce), motivations for engaging in sex can be explained in part by the KFF/Seventeen Magazine survey and by Leonard Sax's stuff (I'll not argue over the Saxion data, but i want to see some sources as you agreed you'd do), and then lastly, Frequency of sex among adoloscents, (I think that CDC and.or other VERY well known sources should be used for this.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and a subsection on contraception usage, I have the CDC data and can find some more, this again should be added to with easily accessible VERY well known sources (Preferably in internet form).</p>
<p>And the Britain section (Well, now it's not totally US centric because its got 2 countries, although we should try and add data from other ocuntries as well) The opening though should comprise of THIS, it seems nuetral enough and worldwide applicable.</p>
<p>Human sexual behavior generally and adolescent sexual behavior in most individuals is typically influenced, or heavily affected by norms from the culture in which the individual lives. Examples of such norms are prohibitions on sexual intercourse before marriage, against homosexual sexual activity, or other taboo activities, because the religion or culture to which the individual belongs forbids them. Sometimes individuals choose not to ascribe to culturally or religious imposed norms.</p>
<p>The above seems pretty good, then in the general adolescent sex in the united states section we can add in the dashed paragraphs, and if you don't mind i'll put in my brief summary of organizations (Or just the advocates for youth one) And perhaps we can try and format it so that the two major opposing viewpoints can be put into General info subsections like FOR and AGAINST in order to reduce the problem of inequal formatting that has occured in the past.</p>
<p>That should clear it up, and we can add in other countries as we go along. (OR make a stub-like general info on adolescent sexuality that has links to articles on adolescent sexuality in other countries.</p>
<p>And... I think that we should include how Adolescent sexual orientations can differ etc. etc. (So it's more than just statistical and represented viewpoint data), I once did thata couple of hours ago, but it got deleted. I hope that it can be kept inside.</p>
<p>Maybe then.. (Yes i know. this is a FULL summary of fixes and additions that i think should be made) We can add links to <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_fetishism.html" title="Sexual fetishism">sexual fetishism</a> <a href="../../../l/g/b/LGBT_44e7.html" title="LGBT">LGBT</a> <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">homosexuality</a> <a href="../../../h/e/t/Heterosexuality.html" title="Heterosexuality">heterosexuality</a> <a href="../../../a/s/e/Asexuality.html" title="Asexuality">asexuality</a> or whatever.</p>

<dd>Nateland, having read Ponton's book, and reviews of Levine's, I don't agree that this text is US centric. They are making sweeping claims about the appropriateness and readiness of adolescents and children for sexual activities. Their claims do not simply focus on teens in the US. I agree that it probably won't be possible to find data on experiences of adolescents during sex. I do think the frequency that teens engage in sexual conduct would be a great addition to this article. More information on contraception usage and on how adolescents determine their sexual orientation would be most welcome if you can find it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As others have said, this really doesn't lend itself to for and against sections. Most of the experts quoted in this section have a much more nuanced view than that and it would be a disservice to them and to the article to pigenhole them like that. Overall, these were some good sugestions, Nateland. --<a href="../../../i/l/l/User%7EIlluminato_0afe.html" title="User:Illuminato">Illuminato</a> 03:07, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why would there be sweeping claims in wikipedia anyway?, unless she has data and concrete evidence (Which I highly) doubt, to prove that this is true for All Adolescents WORLDWIDE. Then it's centric to SOME place!, and since she's from the United states, and seems to have US views, and used a Us publishing house i think that it would be quite reasonable to keep her views in the main united states section, and leonard saxs... he doesn't even claim that to be true for ALL adolescents, so he's DEFINATELY in the United States Section by my standards.</p>

<p>The only thing is that with the high volume of views which can easily be construed as 'against' when compared to those that can be construed themselves as 'for' it is in my opinion a good idea to sort them out like that so that people can get both sides of the issue with ease.</p>
<p>I mean, the current article is a MESS if you don't mind me saying... (AT least father down in it), just one big jumble of words with everything mixed in, now i won't argue the 'trying to get more spotlgiht for your views' viewpoint.</p>
<p>But with it in such a jumble it's bound (In my opinion) to be Really really hard to read it through and get the sources etc....</p>
<p>I mean, we should at <i>least</i> sort the article out by who claims what. And I still think that the Advocates For Youth reference should be included to help equalize the article as i said before. You might not be obligated to give 'minority' views much sunlight, BUT as the FOR side makes up literally half (or a third counting the inbetween) due to the huge volume of people in this country whom have either a for, against, or inbetween viewpoint.</p>
<p>It DOES make up a significant portion of this article. Anyways, we cannot I repear Cannot have the ponton lynn etc. quotes at the START of an article on the worldwide views of Adolescence... i'm sorry if this goes against your views, I understand how you must feel right now.... but for a brief summary of worldwide views I SERIOUSLY think that keeping it to the first paragraph explaining possible cultural &amp; relegious norms etc. is a good idea and that we relegate the Judith Levine, Leonard Sax, and Ponton Lynn opinions down to the section from the United states and seperate them into the 3 categories.</p>
<p>Also, a user had included a brief few words in the article about muslim views on adolescent sex that got deleted in your revert, check out his talk page, his username is Paul Foord, I gave him some suggestions for adding the brief mentions in it and I think that this might end up branching off into other articles....</p>
<p>But anyways, in summary here's what I plab to do NOW.</p>
<p>A. Add the AFY (Advocates for Youth) mention and description IN the main United states part.</p>
<p>B. relegate ALL paragraphs and citations WHICH are POV or come from the above mentioned authors and not a basic description of possible worldwide views of this subject to their respective country sections (Namely the United states section), and before you revert this illuminato, PLEASE discuss it here. We should wait AT LEAST a couple of days and get peoples consensus on the above proposal etc.</p>
<p>C. try and sort out the jumbled text and fix some refs i added early on in editing this article when it was still only a section of <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolescence.html" title="Adolescence">adolescence</a></p>
<p>And what I request be done in or at least SERIOUSLY discussed in the immediate future (within a week).</p>
<p>A. making sections for various authorities and so called experts on the subject OR making for and Against sections for the reasons i mentioned above.</p>

<p>Oh.. sorry i didn't read that part about it not being US centric...&#160;:-)</p>
<p>No, what i mean is that these authors etc. are MAINLY FROM the US, Reside in the US, and as far as I know... have United States views...</p>
<p>Basically, NOT a SINGLE source is cited from outside the United states, now I know that the odds of a knowledgable frenchie (What?, it sounds more interesting than frenchman or 'native' french person) coming across and suddenly filling this page with world wide views of the subject is.... Slim.</p>
<p>But, we CAN and I hope WILL eventually get some views of people from outside, but until then, I say put the current 'garbage' (Sorry, but it is basically garbage until it gets put in the correct section, namely. The United states section&#160;:-))</p>
<p>And even then... Even then!, we should have seperate sections and/or articles for each region.</p>

<dd>Nateland, There are three doctors quoted in the lead with four medical degrees. If they say something about the psychological health of adolescents I am going to believe them before I believe a kid without even a high school diploma.

<p>Although remember, You yourself admitted they were sweeping generalizations, and as far as I know generalizations are NOT supposed to be in Wikipedia, and YOU might not believe ME over THEM, but that doesn't invalidate what I have stated again and again and again, No evidence has been brought up about HOW it applies to ALL adolescents WORLDWIDE.</p>
<p>And Ponton Lynn was the only to say it applied to ALL adolescents, it's simple logic, if there is a sweeping GLOBAL generalizxation on a highly controversial topic such as this, then it should have data to back it up, if not, it should be put in it's rleative section.</p>
<p>I see nothing wrong with putting the POV's in the start of the US section. I myself am willing to allow my Advocates for Youth and Judith Levine data to be put in the same place, BELOW Sax's, Anna's and Lynn's own 'evidence', now if i'm going to make allowances such as that.</p>
<p>Why can't you just allow it to stay that way for ONE DAY!. Until people can give their input etc.</p>
<p>And trust me, don't i repeat DON'T use my age against me, some people know more than others, and I believe what I believe, And I think that based on the above. Just the SUMMARY, That's what the start of an article should be!, A SUMMARY! (The rest comes later if you go by widely used article guidelines)</p>
<p>I think it's quite reasonable, and your ONLY support for keeping that in the top is because of a sweeping generalization made by one of FOUR doctors.</p>
<p>So be a mench, and don't just go about reverting etc. i think this issue should get some hearing time, (People HAVE complained about thsi in the past.. so it's not just me)</p>

<p>Ok, so it should comprise the major viewpoints...</p>
<p>then feel free to edit my revision.</p>
<p>BUT PLEASE do not edit the part on the 'culture shift' as i reworded that to fit better with its potential implications.</p>
<p>And try to leave the HPV rewording alone if you don't put it into the STD article where i think it belongs as it seems less condescending and more towards the truth (A tiny switch can make all the differrence in readibility and accuracy)</p>
<p>And yes... if we keep the beggining as is. Then we'll need to shorten it down so that the reader can see ALL major viewpoints in a short amount enough of time so as not to be unduly influenced by an overdose of certain views.</p>

<p>The current revision should be an acceptable compromise to you Illuminato, and since we're the only two people 'on' this article tonight I say we quit bickering and let it rest?</p>
<p>Agreed?</p>
<p>(I'm going to bed now, I'll place a copy of this in your talk page) And i read the guidelines for leads, but since there are so many potential (And i'm sure existing worldwide views) on this subject that we should simply put those in each respective countries section.</p>
<p>But I must point out, THERE IS NO debate like this about sexual activity between ANYONE over 18 (Even for homosexuals it's not as much as this). It's like the day you turn 18 BOOM!, most controversy and government intervention stops... --___-- seems a bit needless to me considering adolescents are normally sexually mature by the late teens or earlier and EVERYONE makea mistakes and learns from them.</p>

<p>Well, that's a Bare Bones start, But as I posted on your talk page.</p>
<p>my gripe is that the START of the lead is someones (edit: a group of peoples) own moral and/or scientific opinion on adolescent sexuality. But that opinion probably doesn't apply to whole globe a lot, or even most!!!. You see, the sentence that got relegated to the bottom pretty much layed out the stuff, and a summary of such a highly controversial subject (At least in the middle east, and North America and britain) is going to make it NEARLY IMPPOSIBLE to fit in a good summary without exclusivising it.</p>
<p>Which is what happened, so that's why I wanted the basic generic summary of how cultural norms etc. affect activites etc. etc. to stay in the lead, and a note saying issues specific to each country and/or region /relegion etc. etc. be placed in the lead so that people would KNOW where to find them.</p>
<p>It's just too specific and biased to keep it the way it is. The rest i can focus on later (Except if you don't mind i want to fix the survey from, 17 magazine and the KFF so that it says something more to what it could indicate, because saying a cultural shift is happening in that context is like saying Adolescents already DO practice unsafe sex habits, which is clearly biased by mine and i'm sure YOUR means. So i would restate it saying</p>
<p>However, earlier research done in 2000 by ___ &amp; ___ could point to an already cultural norm not recognized by the mass media</p>
<p>(It IS quite obvious that in the MM adolescent sex is viewed with distaste 99.8761% of the time and that leonard sax and lynn ponton THEMSELVES are in the mass media. THEN we could maybe say after the NPOV part,</p>
<p>or it is indicative of a shift in sexual behaviour among adolescents from an existing culture norm. (See what i mean?, human language is VERY easily switchable as you know... and we could very very easily make it POV Like that statement is now)</p>
<p>Other then that... I'm ok with what's in their, a bit of reformatting is needed, and a subsection in the U.S., britain and other countries to be added should be placed inside detailing sexual diversity among adolescents (not just HOW they discover their orientations but saying that sexual orientations among adolescents is as diverse as that of adults (Which it is, as they're sexually mature if not emotionally as you so stubbornly put it&#160;:-)</p>
<p>Although liquid sexuality is ALWAYS a possibility (But let's not be nit picky ok?)</p>

<p>What do I think about it? Very little. Hardly anything was done to improve it... no offense but it's, like I said BARE BONES. It's only one countries info, and in case you don't realize, the sexuality section in <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolescence.html" title="Adolescence">adolescence</a> has been suffering from BIAS for weeks now!, It's time we fix that as well, but enough of that, and onto my proposal.</p>
<p>I think that my proposed lead is quite good, and it seems you're just sticking and sticking and sticking to it, i don't NEED to know about WP:Style, WHAT we need their is WP:fairness and WP:global view...</p>
<p>Just re-read what i posted, the brief summary</p>
<p><a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_sexual_behavior.html" title="Human sexual behavior">Human sexual behavior</a> generally and adolescent sexual behavior in most individuals is typically influenced, or heavily affected by <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norms.html" title="Norms">norms</a> from the culture in which the individual lives.

<p>THIS is fine i think, what about you messedrocker?, and i only suggested a note because i'm guessing you want your data wayyyy up top!. Well, links to get it are there and like you said,</p>
<p>If they want the country specific info, they can just scroll down to the TOC, click on a country, and VOILA!, a (hopefully) ever-improving catalogue of accurate information and facts.</p>
<p>P.S. rocker, I second you like i have seconded many other people about Illuminato's 'facts' (Sorry but to me and others it is HIGHLY dubious), I think that they are biased, POV'd, and until someone can produce the book, and give LINKS to easily peer reviewable sources for Leonard Sax's claims they should be excluded from the article (Claims like that DO need the basic source of the evidence if there is any existing).</p>
<p>Call me extreme, but this is an EXTREMELY controversial subject, and ALL claims should be able to be easily verified for accuracy, validity, and usefullness.</p>

<dd>Nateland, the lead is not supposed to have bare bones, and it is not supposed to have structural notes. It is supposed to be a summary of what is in the article and right now there is nothing in the article about homosexuality or culture or social movements. It would not be appropriate to include it at this time. In the future perhaps, but not now. --<a href="../../../i/l/l/User%7EIlluminato_0afe.html" title="User:Illuminato">Illuminato</a> 02:04, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Bare bones?, i'm not suggesting the lead be bare bones OH NO SIREE!. I'm saying that your proposed additions are a barebones start to improving the article, not to brag but when compared to the PAGES of proposals i've made (Look further up this discussion for my most recent proposal with list of fixes a etc. etc.)</p>
<p>And the opening is simply a NPOV summary of what adolescent sexuality IS, and a brief summary of what cultures think of it etc. and possible norms affecting it.</p>
<p>It mentions homosexuality as an example of cultural prohibitions on sex, if you go by that then we shouldn't include ANY mention of sex before marriage in a negative way OR positive because that not 'connected' to the article.</p>
<p>Explanations of sexual diversity are VERY USEFUL in my opinion in an article all ABOUT adolescent sexuality, due to most adolescents, unless you are lina medina discovering their own orientations etc.</p>
<p>And do you REALLY think that simply summary I proposed contributes to a 'structure'?, now i'm not saying that structure is BAD, but to go by your words and take them to their logical 'logicity' (so as to say), ONE or TWO paragraphs briefly explaining WHAT adolescent sexuality IS. NOT the views of it, this is about adolescent sexuality in itself, I think that over the edit wars we've lost that the Whole POINT of the article is to explain what adolescent sexuality IS.</p>
<p>NOT just the views, and If we include them, NOT to give them precedence over all the other topics and issues related to this.</p>
<p>Judith levine, Leonard Sax, and Lynn Ponton's views are not part of adolescent sexuality in itself.</p>
<p>It should be in a seperate article (And it would settle a LOT of these conflicts and allow for the progression of a MAIN informational article in itself).</p>
<p>I think that this branching off would also allow the various parts of a subject to be less subject to edit wars, and we can simply include linksd to the in dividual topics from the main page.</p>
<p>Waddaya say?</p>
<p>IS WHAT should be in the lead. Come to think of it, we should put all about adolescent sexuality in a seperate article, as its being in here is kind of derogatory to the advancement of the article.</p>
<p>THEN it would fit. Adolescent sexuality in itself is NOT, I state again NOT a debate, it is a PART OF LIFE!.</p>

<p>SUMMARY: This article IS about adolescence, and YES I know that saying it should just be a detailed reference for info on adolescent sexuality, orientation, and contraception.</p>
<p>It would EASILY get rid of the problems presented by respresenting Major points of view in the article.</p>
<p>Instead, they could branch off to a seperatere subarticle WHICH was ALL ABOUT individual opninions worldwide.</p>
<p>Plus I think that it would cut down on article length over time as more countries were added.</p>
<p>This could also be applied to other articles of particular debate, however without opinions in the main articles themselves, but easily accessible with plentiful links to the articles CONTAINING THOSE.</p>
<p>It would probably ease off the load of edit warring and disputes that plague wikipedia to this day?</p>
<p>Think it's a good idea?</p>

</ul>
<p>There are at least 200 countries. I don't think each one deserves its own separate article about adolescent sexuality because it assumes that everyone in one country is of one mind. There are bound to be many different view points in one country. There will still be disagreement because everyone in a country does not have a unison opinion. If there is a point of view that is unique to a certain part of the world, that might be worth mentioning, but I think many views are going to be shared by people in more than just one country. <a href="../../../j/e/c/User%7EJecowa_587b.html" title="User:Jecowa">Jecowa</a> 04:23, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Illuminato, we're talking about a MAIN ARTICLE for pov's on this subject. And not as a POV fork... no, it would be to reduce edit warring in THIS article and allow things to actually get done such as inputting scientific data and such which to me hold more precendence than how many and whose POV'S are in the article.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>It is not meant as a POV fork, it's meant as a POV compromise. I think that Jecowas usage of the term is simply mean't to try and detract from what I have been saying for weeks now in order to push his OWN views into the article.</p>
<p>Besides, your creation of the other articles IS a POV fork that would allow much easier POV'ing and crookedness of articles due to their immensity once a bunch of countries are added.. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENateland_dd34.html" title="User:Nateland">Nateland</a> 21:07, 23 January 2007 (UTC) As <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Lehrer_f6ba.html" title="Tom Lehrer">Tom Lehrer</a> said in his song 'smut', "Smut, i'm for it" Just thought i'd half randomly include that phrase (I like it it's kind of funny)</p>
<p>Anyways, i'm glad so many people agree partially or in whole with this.</p>
<p>I REALLY do think however messedrocker that even a SMALL section at the end listing views could and probably WOULD develop into an edit war... It seems a good idea to make an article such as... Controversy over adolescent sexuality</p>
<p>Or such, however, i've said this MANY times before. Even IF we fix it here, the main article on sexuality Still has a ravaged and biased section in it that seems to be struggling just to get by. I say that (On a side note) After we decide on this articles fate, then we delete the adolescent sexuality section and provide a link to this article as this is the MAIN article on adolescence and this whole adolescent sexuality article was created by Illuminato in what I STRONGLY percieve as a duplication of efforts, say what you wish Illumina.. but you gave NO reference to this article when you made it, and the Only reason I founds it was by a comment in <a href="../../../a/d/o/Talk%7EAdolescence_0486.html" title="Talk:Adolescence">talk:adolescence</a>.</p>
<p>So whatever happens here, we should soon after turn to fixing the adolescence article.</p>
<p>Oh yes, messedrocker, would you mind adding a link to <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_education.html" title="Sex education">sex education</a>?, it wouldn't cause any controversies in all likelyhood and it would help bolster the article a bit while we debate what happens to it.</p>
<p>Anyways, on a closing note. I think that a 'pov' fork as Jecowa put it... (I don't mean FORK!, i mean make a seperate article for views on this subject to decrease disputes). is a good idea, believe me.</p>
<p>If IDENTICAL text from this article is trickling into other similar articles than something needs to be done (Before the entire sexuality portal or at least a good portion of it erupts in edit warring and disputes galore)</p>
<p>Now I have very little experience with the flow and 'joe' of wikipedia but doing something about fixing this article SOON could very well help to stop this from spreading out.</p>
<p>Well, I hope you listened to what i have to say, and also, perhaps we could get more people involved?, just from people who've contributed to this article or have Some extra knowledge of the subject so we can come to a more accurate decision)</p>

<p>After I posted i realized that i kinda.. well, never mind.</p>
<p>Although, Jecowa. I find it REALLY insulting how you immediately denounced my proposal with a tap of your enter key and the statement "It doesn't make any sense"...</p>
<p>It makes PLENTY of sense, how ELSE would two other people have responded legibly, clearly, and readily stated their thoughts and feelings.</p>
<p>Now as a clearer overview of my last post.</p>
<p>A. including even a small section for views could turn the article into another battleground.</p>
<p>B. If we make another article specifically for views in the US and not world wide views (Maybe we could make an index article that this page would a link to, the index article could list various view points by country and/or relegion) It should be called something like 'adolescent sexuality controversy in the united states' Paul you're naming proposal was good but it would be a bit unexplanatory to call it that.</p>
<p>Call me nit-picky but it would be a quick way to show what the article is about.</p>
<p>C. we should soon turn focus to the main article on <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolescence.html" title="Adolescence">adolescence</a> and try to fix the adolescent sexuality section OR delete it and make a link to the MAIN article on the subject.</p>
<p>D. that's about it, i've got homework to do and i'm waiting for some magnatune WAV files to download (I would've used flac had i known it's benifits...damn is WAV still proprietary?)</p>

<p>it can be found here controversy over adolescent sexuality I thought that it could potentially be linked to this page and would hold major POV'S etc. from different countries on adolescent sexuality.</p>
<p>As Illuminato's adolescent sexuality in the united states is Already included in this article as this is the main article for that topic and adolescent sexuality in other countries.</p>
<p>My main problem with him making that article is its potential to be used as a kind of pov get-a-round by stemming off from this main article and essentially creating TWO topics on adolescent sexuality 'three counting the adolescent sexuality section in the main article on adolescence'.</p>
<p>I think that we should use the conteroversy article to keep pov's as making individual articles for each country would spread out a coordinated attempt to easily edit and improve articles on this subject and again.. it concerns me as Illuminato created this article in itself.</p>
<p>And now... he's making ANOTHER article and including basically the same text as when I first began to work on the topic.</p>
<p>Just my thought's, i'll forward this to ALL major players.</p>

<p>The article i created appears to have mysteriously dissapeared.</p>
<p>And no record of its creation can be found ANYWHERE on wikipedia.</p>
<p>Sigh... anyways, could the protection on this page be removed?, as the MAJOR people who were against changing this article have either not responded when they had the chance and simply created a different article on the same subject (Except centric) or they are not in the majority.</p>
<p>Hopefully editing can begin soon.... i'd like to get some stuff done.</p>

<p>After I posted some messages over POV forking articles which are already or were meant to be covered by this article. Illuminato raised some concerns of his in this response. AND while I didn't really believe this to hold any standing whatsoever, I thought that it would be a good way to decide if the 'spin-offs' such as <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolescent_sexuality_in_Britain_8134.html" title="Adolescent sexuality in Britain">adolescent sexuality in Britain</a> <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolescent_sexuality_in_the_United_States_917b.html" title="Adolescent sexuality in the United States">adolescent sexuality in the United States</a> and <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolescent_sexuality_in_India_c8a9.html" title="Adolescent sexuality in India">adolescent sexuality in India</a> should stay or not or be incoporated into the MAIN article, with those pages being converted to redirects to this page.</p>
<p>His concerns are below.</p>
<p>Nateland, When I created the articles on the separate countries they were not POV forks. They were spinouts from the main article, much like the Adolescent Sexuality article is a spinout of the main adolescence article. Please check out the WP guidelines on spinouts. It says:</p>
<p>Sometimes, when an article gets to be very long, a section of the article is made into its own article, and the handling of the subject in the main article is condensed to a brief summary. This is completely normal Wikipedia procedure; the new article is sometimes called a "spinout" or "spinoff" of the main article, see for example wikipedia:summary style, which explains the technique.</p>
<p>I hope this clears it up for you. --Illuminato 22:17, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think some discussion of this matter would be greatly benefiting to wikipedias integrity due to MY own concerns and the probable concerns of others on this site.</p>
<p>Server strain: multiple articles which could easily be covered by a single article can cause server slowdown.</p>
<p>Easy Weasel-wording/POV'ing: Multiple articles reduces chances of catching biased and/or weasel words and/or unsourced and unbacked up statements etc. and allows people to more easily add in those undesirable things.</p>
<p>If we simply made a seperate article for POV we could easily cut the article by two-thirds... then it would be even SHORTER!. allowing for more expansion etc. etc.</p>
<p>Triplication of efforts: When Illuminato made THIS article after the debates over the sexuality section in <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolescence.html" title="Adolescence">adolescence</a> kept on going another series of debates arose and further up this page is a comment saying basically.</p>
<p>"Sounds like a duplication of efforts to me"</p>
<p>Now, with these NEW articles being made i'm tempted to call it a 'triplication' of efforts.</p>
<p>Well that about sums it up? A vote perhaps? <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENateland_dd34.html" title="User:Nateland">Nateland</a> 23:18, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nice catch, Jeodesic. The article, says the 17.13 figure was the age Britons lost their virginity in 2002. The higher numbers are from 2006. I'll correct in the other article. This one will have to wait until protection is lifted. --<a href="../../../i/l/l/User%7EIlluminato_0afe.html" title="User:Illuminato">Illuminato</a> 18:45, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't see a contradiction -- what that says is that for both sexes, the average age for loss of virginity is 17.13 years. When only counting the girls, it's 17.44, and when only counting the boys, it's 18.06. <a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMessedrocker_53b5.html" title="User:Messedrocker"><font color="red">★<small>MESSED</small></font></a><a href="../../../m/e/s/User_talk%7EMessedrocker_915e.html" title="User talk:Messedrocker"><font color="red"><small>ROCKER</small>★</font></a> 22:16, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It may not be contradictory, but it is wrong. It is slightly confusing in the article as they give the aggregate number for 2002, and the breakdown between the sexes for 2006.--<a href="../../../i/l/l/User%7EIlluminato_0afe.html" title="User:Illuminato">Illuminato</a> 23:09, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So it appears there has been conversation going on, which is always good. However, I'm still confused. At this point in time, what are the editorial issues that remain? If any? I've heard forks have been made regarding views in countries about adoloscent sexuality, but do we have a method about how to deal it <i>in this article itself</i>? <a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMessedrocker_53b5.html" title="User:Messedrocker"><font color="red">★<small>MESSED</small></font></a><a href="../../../m/e/s/User_talk%7EMessedrocker_915e.html" title="User talk:Messedrocker"><font color="red"><small>ROCKER</small>★</font></a> 06:15, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, mainly if the article is too POV'D. If it gives equal sunlight to all POVS. And whether it should be split into TWO articles.</p>
<p>One for the MAIN article on adolescence with GLOBALLY PERTAINING information. Which would essentially be the existing one with a definition of adolescent sexuality, different possible orientations, a little bit about contraception. Etc.</p>
<p>and another one for POV's on adolescent sexuality. With a brief explanation on the global controvesy over this topic and sections for each individual country, with major POV'S in each sectino which pertain to that particular country etc.</p>
<p>My idea is that this would GREATLY cut down on the ARGUMENTS and EDIT WARS. And although a few people oppose this, Me and others think it's a good idea.</p>
<p>Especially with cut&amp;pasted pov's being taken out of</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolescent_sexuality.html" title="Adolescent sexuality">adolescent sexuality</a> and put into.</p>
<p><a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_education.html" title="Sex education">sex education</a> <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolescence.html" title="Adolescence">adolescence</a> <a href="../../../t/e/e/Teen_pregnancy.html" title="Teen pregnancy">teen pregnancy</a> and a few others. Mainly by the <a href="../../../i/l/l/User%7EIlluminato_0afe.html" title="User:Illuminato">User:Illuminato</a>. Anyways, this is my proposition. Once the controversy over AS article is created, i'll leave it alone. But with the current off-shoots being justified by editors concerns that the article is long enough to warrant spin-offs due to extreme length.</p>
<p>I think that putting the POV'S, in another article would be a GREAT idea!!&#160;:-) Hell, i just want'a finish up this argument, repair this article to an acceptable state. And VOILA!, I can put my energies into other things on wikipedia instead of a senseless edit war over a topic such as THIS!.</p>
