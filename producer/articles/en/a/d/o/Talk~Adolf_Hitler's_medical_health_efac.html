<p>Having studied Hitler both at undergraduate and Sixth Form level, I have never come across the 'fact' that he was addicted to drugs.</p>
<p>It would be very useful if the article could include clear references to where this point is being made, that it is not universally accepted, and point out other sources (as Haffner's biography "Anmerkungen zu Hitler") which do not make this claim.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I nor anyone else here gives a damn that you studied Hitler "at undergraduate and Sixth Form level." The only reference listed so far details the addictions. The entire article begins by noting that the subject is controversial. See also the article on Theodore Morell for your enlightenment. --<a href="../../../l/2E/_/User%7EL._6c28.html" title="User:L.">L.</a> 22:56, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That is indeed what I meant (yes, it is me again), plus a wider variety of sources. If I were to rely on what an individual historian had to say about Hitler, my view on the issue would be very skewed indeed. Furthermore do I believe that the reliability of the one source (Waite) can be disputed, but that is a different matter.</dd>
<dd>May I suggest that you (L.) treat other users with a little more respect and react to constructive criticism like any decent rational being? I believe that I have sufficient justification to make the claim I have made, if only from studying several well-respected Hitler biographies (Kershaw, Fest, Haffner, Bullock) and the fact that I had close contact with Oliver Hirschbiegel's and Bernd Eichinger's team who were working on "The Downfall"/"Der Untergang", a new German film on the last days in the Führerbunker, and I haven't come across Hitler's amphetamine/cocaine addiction being presented as a fact as it is here. I would suggest that this should be changed.</dd>
<dd>On a different matter, may I suggest that the whole business about Hitler having only one testicle be removed entirely or at least cut down to a single statement that it is neither true nor relevant, as I believe that the far more important aspects of Hitler's life are put into a wrong perspective this way. If we were to evaluate the truth of every propaganda claim made about the sexual (or otherwise) health of Nazi characters or indeed any one politician, a lot of time would go to waste and the importance of relevance in historical contexts would vanish entirely.</dd>

<dd>Agreed, lighten up&#160;:) AH's meth and cocaine addictions are still controversial, especially as to timing. There's never been much doubt he was addicted to both at the time of his suicide but one could use more documentation about his intake of medications (and motives) during the 1930s. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 11:41, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree. What's interesting is that the article claims there is controversy surrounding Hitler's medical health, but according to various academic sources and academically credible resources, like the History Channel, there is little to no controversy. The controversy that exists seems to be "popular controversy" which is like the "controversy" regarding <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a>. Personally, instead of this wiki article, I prefer David Irving's book <u>The Secret Diaries of Hitler's Doctor</u> which extensively details Hitler's medical history, including this fun fact: Morell administered over eighty medicines to Hitler between 1941 and 1945. There's an appendix, too, describing these medicines. But I won't mess with the tags because the newbies tend to take offense. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 11:41, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

<p>No, you must precisely list the alleged points of bias here on the talk page before posting the tag (please do make the list, however).

<p>I must say the "sexuality" part of Hitler is total rubbish. The only evidence of his sexuality is probably one of low libido as hinted in Oberregierungsrat Leybold's Statement...</p>
<p>"He has no interest in women, and received the visits of women friends and followers without any particular enthusiasm but with the utmost politeness, and never allowed himself to be drawn into serious political discussions with them."</p>
<p>He was definately not homosexual, never painted male nudes but did several female nudes and had at least one girlfriend Eva Broun (sp?) whom he later married.</p>
<p>The very page "Adolf Hitler's medical health" comes across as an immature attempt by Zionists to humiliate somemone who despised and humiliated them. Hitler's health is historically totally irrelevant and anyone who thinks Hitler might have been insane should take a closer look at Hitler's exceptional military accomplishments, artistic skills, political and social knowledge, and many other skills he possesed. It takes a very high IQ to be able to study and understand Marxism theory and Hitler proved more than capable of handling that and many other complex subjects. Personally I think this page is comprised of vengeful baby talk and undermines Wiki in general. In the same way that Israelis today are systematically eliminating all Arabs/Muslims around Israel so too did Hitler, a German nationalist, eliminate Jews from his homeland which he undoubtably loved. George Bush I might add is also carrying out his own nationalistic crusade in Iraq and Afganistan against whom he calls "islamofachists"!!! There is absolutely no difference between successive Israeli governments, Bush, and Hitler... all being extreme nationalists hell-bent on "cleansing" the World from evil, although Hitler has the advantage of being far more intelligent to the rest and his "accomplishments" prove this. Thank you and regards, Marios Polycarpou.</p>
<p>What does sexuality have to do with one's "medical health"? Are the authors implying homosexuality is a disease?67.190.197.116 09:21, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I absolutely agree. What are speculations about his sexuality doing in an article about his health? If you could work it into something about his mental health, then maybe. At the moment it's insulting to gay people.Neil 03:35, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Medical Health and Sexual Orientation are completely different topics; this is in its present state incredibly insulting to gay people! Sexual orientation is in no way a reflection of one's health, physical or mental. I request that this be removed unless someone can give a compelling reason to link one's health and orientation.

<dd>I came to the talk page to say this, thankfully someone already has. Orientation is not an illness, mental or otherwise. I'd like to add my voice to those saying it should be moved/removed immediately. 74.78.228.126 23:21, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is in stark contrast to other reports which that he chose a semi-vegetarian diet because of adverse reactions to red meat consumption, which included stomach cramps, excessive sweating and flatulence.

<p>I've heard that Hitler was injured in the head (probably during WW1) and had a metal plate and this was the reason he covered his forehead. I've also heard about injuries to the upper lip. That would explain the silly moustace, but then it was in style then so... // <a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELiftarn_fddd.html" title="User:Liftarn">Liftarn</a></p>

<p><i>"Hitler, just like Goebbels, was burned (carbonized, to be exact) after his suicide, there hardly could be much left for autopsy after his death."</i> Now, this just isn't correct. Hitler was partially cremated using (from memory) around 12 gallons of petrol. One foot was charred off, the skin was burned off along with some muscle tissue and the underlying fat deposits at extremities only; the skull remained mostly intact, all teeth survived, the torso mainly intact apart from the bit that was uppermost. Same goes for Goebbels who was easily identified in profile by people who knew him. Garrick92 18:33, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm not sure about that but he get injured when the allies attacked the trench where he was with mustard gas.</p>
