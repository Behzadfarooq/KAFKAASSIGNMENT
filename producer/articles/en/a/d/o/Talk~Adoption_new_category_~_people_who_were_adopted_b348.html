<h2><span class="mw-headline">new category&#160;: people who were adopted</span></h2>
<p>I'd like to see a new category of people who were adopted. I don't know how to word it. "Category:Adopted" seems insensitive to me. Category:people who were adopted seems too long. What do you think?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry, I'm not sure I understand. Is it like a list of 'famous' adopted people, just like you have in say, astrology, 'famous' taurus, leo, etc? Just curious. <a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdidas_c7b4.html" title="User:Adidas">Adidas</a> 11:03, 8 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, famous people who were adopted. I read Steve Jobs' commencement speech - about how complicated his adoption was - and I was inspired by how he overcame such a complicated beginning to his life. I'm fascinated in the details of people's lives that make them who they are. I'd like to know who else is adopted. But I also know that (most) people who are adopted are very sensitive about the subject. "Category:Adopted" just seems too blunt. I thought maybe people here in Talk:Adoption would have some insight. Or maybe I should just drop it.
<dl>
<dd>Actually why not? It sounds like a good idea. Maybe it could start of a section on that page. I'm sure though some people will object to it on moral grounds, since one could argue that adoption shouldn't be seen as something to overcome. The same could be said for say 'famous blacks'. <a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdidas_c7b4.html" title="User:Adidas">Adidas</a> 20:01, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Indeed, there is <a href="../../../f/a/m/Famous_African-Americans_c928.html" title="Famous African-Americans">Famous African-Americans</a>. Would this also include famous people who have adopted? <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwardian_b62f.html" title="User:Edwardian">Edwardian</a> 07:35, 9 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I guess the page could be split in two: adoptee and adopters. I googled searched "famous adopted people" and they are quite a few resources out there. Cheers <a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdidas_c7b4.html" title="User:Adidas">Adidas</a> 08:46, 9 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I agree, I don't want it to be a list of people who "overcame" their adoption. Although I think that might be the appropriate phrase for Steve Jobs because his was particularly difficult. That is odd that there is a <a href="../../../f/a/m/Famous_African-Americans_c928.html" title="Famous African-Americans">Famous African-Americans</a> list. Not because that implys they had to overcome their blackness, but because it seems like there would be too many. Although I do get your point. Funny, I'm very interested in the List of famous redheads. And I have thought about how that might be racist. But there are so few redheads. I'd like to see both an adoptee and adopters list. Hmm. How about "Category:Adoptee" that sounds better than "Category:Adopted".
<dl>
<dd>I disagree with using the term 'adoptee'. It is still not a word; it attempts to define a person by the fact of their adoption (something rightly criticised in the 'Adoptism' section); it sounds like a disability (amputee). I know many adopted people who share this POV. Regarding the proposed section on "famous adopted people", bear in mind that many of the 'resources' on the web are inaccurate. I've seen former U.S. President Bill Clinton included in such lists, for example, but he was not adopted, he just had a stepfather. That's just one example.
<dl>
<dd>"Adoptee" is indeed a word, and not one that is <i>inherently</i> offense. It is a descriptive word that does not "define a person" anymore than "employee" "defines a person". <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwardian_b62f.html" title="User:Edwardian">Edwardian</a> 21:45, 13 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I stand corrected. I've found references to the word "adoptee" in three (online) dictionaries. I would point out, however, that they were all American dictionaries. I've found no references to it in <i>English</i> English dictionaries and my Word 2003 spellchecker (set to English (Ireland)) still underlines "adoptee" as a misspelling. So while it may be in common use in the United States, just note that this isn't the case in the U.K. or Ireland. --<a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastun_82b1.html" title="User:Bastun">Bastun</a> 09:12, 15 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I have seen and used the word <i>adoptee</i> quite a few times and I'm not American, I'm British. I think <i>adoptee</i> is far less offensive than the whole <i>adopted child</i> versus <i>biological child</i> terminology. I positively cringe at having to refer to anyone as my <i>birth parent[s]</i> or <i>biological parent[s]</i> or <i>adoptive parent[s]</i>. My parents are my mum and dad. The people who contributed biologically to my existence are 'parents' in the very loosest terms. <a href="../../../n/a/o/User%7ENao__61a1.html" title="User:Nao*">Nao*</a> 14:52, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Adopted child" is infantalizing. Adopted person is more appropriate for an individual over the age of 11. Do 50 year old individuals really want to be referred to as "adopted children?"</p>
