<h2><span class="mw-headline">AH was a vegetarian</span></h2>
<p>I know this makes some vegetarians gnash their teeth, but it's true. It wasn't because of Geli, either, but likely more because of his fear of cancer and other stuff (he and his sister Paula watched their mother Klara die a particularly painful death from breast cancer when he was 18... they both took care of and spent much time with her during this period, although he became a vegetarian much later).</p>
<p>Sources confirming his vegetarianism abound, here's a helpful summary of them <a href="http://www.geocities.com/hitlerwasavegetarian/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/hitlerwasavegetarian/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>Bormann even built a greenhouse at Berchtesgaden to ensure a steady supply of fresh veggies to AH, I've seen pictures of Bormann's kids inside, tending it or whatever. Last I heard/read (last year I think), the foundation of the greenhouse was still visible.</p>
<p>Along with being a genocidal sociopath and charismatic German nationalist, AH was also an avid non-smoker. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 00:12, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, w all due respect, I can go on citing examples of people claiming he was vegetarian, or critical of meat consumption, as well as examples of him eating various meats intentionally or unintentionally, for the forseable future.

<p>It's a trivia item in the article... there aren't too many reliable references "questioning" it... however the reliable sources usually mention plainly that Mr Hitler wasn't a vegetarian until some time during the early 30s. One must also remember that AH is (likely deservedly) one of the most smeared people in history. Lots of people made up all sorts of negative and untrue stuff about him, as if the truth wasn't scary enough, more so IMHO. The wartime OSS reports are full of that sort of thing, as was the popular press. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 17:02, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>We're mentioning it in the "The road to power" section as well. But, yeah, if we were to mention and then question every strange fact written about him, the article wouldn't be very encyclopedic. I actually think the article is very good now. How are the prospects of it ever becoming featured? <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShanes_8450.html" title="User:Shanes">Shanes</a> 17:37, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Given how controversial, misunderstood (in terms of detail) and polarizing the subject is, how about a snowball's chance on Venus? If it ever is featured, the numbers of kooks, vandals and PoV warriors attracted to it would likely be overwhelming and it's already one of the most vandalized articles on WP (only giving my thoughts though, one way or another I think it'd be helpful to feature it). <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 17:44, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>How is it that you cite a geocities article, and then dismiss 80,000 google hits, many of them vegetarian publications? This information could be discussed in a trivia section, along w tales of his escape to antartica, or his purported sexual fetishes. It is not however appropriate under "road to power", nor are speculations regarding his niece. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 15:02, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, the geocities link is replete with reliable citations and sources, which is why I chose it. As for the pitfalls of citing raw quantitative Google stats, the phrase <i>Hitler saved the world</i> gets over half a million hits <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Hitler+saved+the+world&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Hitler+saved+the+world&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, and <i>Hitler was Jesus</i> gets almost a million <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Hitler+was+Jesus&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Hitler+was+Jesus&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 16:02, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>We do agree that speculations about Geli are unhelpful for the article, although mentioning her suicide is IMO encyclopedic. However, mentioning wholly unsupported stuff about fetishes and retirements to Antarctica is not encylopedic, since including all the nutty things ever said about Mr Hitler would fill several books and be way detached from reality. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 16:12, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ok, another remark about all those veggie publications trying to downplay (or discredit) AH's vegetarianism. Can you imagine a full page magazine ad of a contented looking Hitler with the natural, mountainous beauty of Berchtesgaden in the background, captioned, <i>All sorts of interesting people are vegetarian!</i> This sort of truth in advertising would be unlikely to help these websites and publications sell whatever it is they peddle. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 16:17, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Dear Sam, dear Wyss, if I may weigh in on this: it is an undisputed fact that Hitler was a vegetarian in practice. Sometimes he is quoted uttering disdain for "carnivores" but then these quotes are usually rather dubious. On the other hand, I have heard it too that his eating habits were for medical reasons and not so much his free choice. Maybe a compromise would be to include his vegetarianism but also state that some allege this to be for medical reasons. (Other Nazis however were fully fledged vegetarians, e.g. Rudolf HeÃ.) <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 20:12, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>From the early 1930s AH was a vegetarian. I know this makes some vegetarians uncomfortable and there seems to be a revisionist movement afoot which claims he "cheated" (these stories are usually confounded with accounts from the 1920s when he did eat meat) or to retroactively "change the definition" of what vegetarianism is in order to exclude him and so on but Hitler's vegetarianism is widely documented. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 05:41, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've read in quite a few books that he was like 95% vegetarian and did eat meat <b>very occasionally</b>, like he might have a German bratwurst or blutwurst rarely -- apparently his diet was rather dull and quite repetitive, with him eating vegetable soup or something very similar like 5-6 days a week. He also drank sporadically, meaning he wasn't a complete <a href="../../../t/e/e/Teetotaler.html" title="Teetotaler">teetotaler</a> like he claimed to be...he had a <a href="../../../b/a/v/Bavarian.html" title="Bavarian">Bavarian</a> brewery brew him up a special beer with a VERY low-alcohol content when he became the <a href="../../../d/e/r/Der_F%C3%BChrer_851e.html" title="Der FÃ¼hrer">der FÃ¼hrer</a>, and he would also sip wine and champagne on special occasions and during certain meals. All of these myths about his diet and personality go back to the way the other Nazi leaders wanted to potray Hitler to the German populace and the World...they wanted to paint him as a self-denying <a href="../../../a/s/c/Ascetic.html" title="Ascetic">ascetic</a> who worked non-stop day and night for "The German people" and "the German Reich" and refused ALL luxuries and extras so that he might "get the job done quicker." This wasn't completely true at all, though SOME of it certainly was. (according to some sources he supposedly ate like a pound or more of chocolate/sweets every day!) --<a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.188.116.5.html" title="User:205.188.116.5">205.188.116.5</a> 11:08, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Removed passage</span></h2>
<p>The passage I removed places an undue emphasis on just one element, one influence of Austrian culture at that time. Especially Upper Austria was heavily nationalist in the German sense. It is reported from Hitler's childhood and he never identified as a Catholic, except for propaganda reason. We need not continue his propaganda here, do we? <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 21:02, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>First, they (his family) were all Catholics (nominally or otherwise) and second anti-Semitism was indeed deeply ingrained in early twentieth century German-Catholic culture (which included the border areas he grew up in). AH's anti-semitism did not arise from a void, nor was his amplified and contagious take on it received in one. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 23:42, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>No, of course it did not spring from a void, but the way it stands now places the focus entirely on "Catholic culture" (whatever that is) connected with the very strong "deeply ingrained" while it leaves out German nationalism completely. Note Hitler's sympathy for the "Away-from-Rome movement" and schoolboy Adolf's selection of his classmates into Germanics and non-Germanic (I'm saying Germanic to somehow illustrate in the English language what he said in German: "Du bist kein Germane!" - He didn't say "Du bist kein Deutscher!" This difference gets lost in translation. In a way, German nationalism in the Habsburg monarchy was akin to a "traitorous philosophy" not any less than other nationalisms and Hitler subscribed to it radically - this is why he dogded the Austrian military but volunteered in Bavaria.</p>
<p>To sum it up: my concern is a unbalanced wording, not the passage in itself. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 09:20, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Adding a phrase about German nationalist influences during his childhood is ok by me. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 11:53, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hitler made it clear that his anti-semitism came late, based upon pamphlets and political newspapers he read. It had nothing to do with him being catholic, or german-catholic culture he absorbed in his childhood. He insisted that he opposed anti-semitism as religious persecution, until he saw what I assume was a hassidim, and said "could this be a german too?", whereupon he decided Jews were a foriegn, non-german race, and thus acceptable to persecute. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 14:49, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Again, <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a>, documented history and the work of many peer-reviewed historians does not support your assertion that AH's anti-semitism was not influenced by his childhood environment. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 14:54, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"There were very few Jews in Linz.

<p><i>my aversion to hearing remarks against them grew almost into a feeling of abhorrence. I did not in the least suspect that there could be such a thing as a systematic anti-Semitism</i></p>
<p>...these words plainly show he was familiar with anti-semitic remarks (how else could he have developed an "aversion" to them) and did not regard the anti-semitism he'd been exposed to as <i>systemic</i>, a spot on description of the typical, everyday anti-semitic attitudes he grew up with. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 15:59, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, it shows he was familiar.

<dd>I read Hitler to say he at first was no anti-Semite since others hated the Jews on religious grounds and he rejected religion as a basis for hatred.

<p>However, a raw Google search for a phrase, even one which seems to support my edits on this topic, is unscientific in the extreme, shouldn't be relied upon and never be used as a cite.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Speech Platform</span></h2>
<p>I'm pretty sure that most of Hitler's early speeches were delivered in the beerhalls, not on street corners, as the article says under <i>Early Nazi Party</i>--<a href="../../../x/i/p/User%7EXiphon_f273.html" title="User:Xiphon">Xiphon</a> 20:10, 6 September 2005 (UTC).</p>

<dd>That's mostly true and truth be told, I've never been comfortable with that "street corner" characterization... although he did do a few speeches on what amounted to street corners during the early 1920s. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 20:42, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">declaration of war</span></h2>
<p>If the Japanese treaty so unequivocally called for it, why is there dispute at all about this declaration?</p>
<p>Some say (S. Haffner) it was because Hitler was already certain Germany would be defeated and wanted it to perish.</p>
<p>Others say Hitler considered it only a ratification of an already existing, though undeclared, state of war with the US.</p>
<p>Why these discussion if the situation is so clear?</p>

<p>It's usually mentioned because AH may not have declared war on the US if the treaty didn't exist. Although the German high command didn't take the US military too seriously in late 1941, they knew declaring war on the US was risky and some saw it as a further slide down the slippery slope. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 08:33, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Geli Raubal and vegetarianism</span></h2>
<p>I give up, I fully admit it not important or worth worrying over, but for the record many dispute the extent of his vegetarianism, and the idea that Hitler molested his niece (forcing her to pee on his face from the account I read), while conceivably notable, is low quality hearsay worthy only of a conspiracy theory or trivia section of the article. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 16:44, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>There is zero evidence AH ever peed on Geli Raubal's face. The OSS got fed lots of nutty "intelligence" reports by certain deeply alienated Germans. It's an old rumour with no historical support, none, goose eggs.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>He likely <i>was</i> intimate with his niece (but we don't know for sure), like his father Alois was with <i>his</i> niece (who happened to be Adolf's mum). It's not even close to conspiracy theory, Geli blew her heart out in his apartment with his pistol. He was seeing Eva Braun by then. That's all documented history. Putting someone's suicide in a trivia section is, uhm... unencyclopedic IMO.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Just for the record: AH was not dating Eva Braun during Geli's lifetime. The background to her sÃºicide is that he went on campaign or other political stuff and left her alone in the Munich appartment, placing an SA man to guard the door. So she shot herself. It was only after Geli's death that AH came to Eva Braun as a replacement. And with her it was the same all over again. EB tried to kill herself twice though unsucessfully (though this failure might very well be planned) to force AH to stay closer to her. She succeeded in this and ended up on the "Berghof". <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 19:13, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>There is no documented connection between Geli and AH's vegetarianism, that's another (but slightly more recent) rumour.</li>

<p>Dear Wyss, I'm not so sure whether it is right to take out Geli alltogether. After all, he was very close to her and her death did not got unnoticed. After all, this article is about the whole person A.H.

<p>Please note, whether included or not, her name is "Geli" (short for Angelika).

<li>He has a house at the <a href="../../../o/b/e/Obersalzberg.html" title="Obersalzberg">Obersalzberg</a> near (not in) Berchtesgarden that was expanded and the nazi clique built house there too.</li>

<p>In 1938, some disgruntled German guy (name?) attempted to assasinate Hitler at a beer house where he was giving a speech. However, Hitler left early, and the bomb that was planted exploded killing several NAzis, but not Hitler. He was killed in Dachau in 1945. I was wondering if anyone knew his name. it's an interesting historical tidbit. i learned about him at dachau and at the topography of terror in berlin. XXXX</p>

<p>Someone tried to change AH's baby photo to the famous school photo taken in Linz when he was a pre-teen, and put a PoV caption on it. Most historians have noticed AH's demeanor in that photo and attribute it to severe adjustment problems he had after enrolling in a much larger school in a larger town, when only a year before he'd been a popular small-town kid described as a "ring leader" among his friends (by all accounts he was miserable at the new school). Using a single photo (with a facial expression captured in a fraction of a second) to characterize someone's psychological state during late childhood is IMHO unsupportable and not encyclopedic. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 18:59, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, while 2000 years ago it had a more limited meaning, documented usage has since changed, see <a href="http://dict.die.net/decimate/" class="external autonumber" title="http://dict.die.net/decimate/" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> and <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=decimate" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=decimate" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>. However, the anon editor who altered this to <i>devastated</i> seems to be part of a significant minority, in the latter cite there's a note implying (but not stating outright) 44% of that dictionary's usage panel preferred the anon's take on the word. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 16:26, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>He was not a mass murderer. Mr Hitler was a genocidal sociopath. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 19:24, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I see there is a section of <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_murder.html" title="Mass murder">mass murder</a> called <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_murder.html#Mass_murder_by_a_state" title="Mass murder">mass murder by a state</a>. Hitler was the head of state and was the driving force behind the <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_solution.html" title="Final solution">final solution</a>. I'm not comfortable with the logic that since Hitler didn't kill all those people on his own, that he is not a mass murderer.</dd>
<dd>The category <b>totalitarian dictators</b> doesn't imply mass murder or genocide, i.e. although Mussolini and Castro are not known for being genocidal, they are listed alongside Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot and MiloÅ¡eviÄ. The Mussolini article states <i>Mussolini has been said to have saved more Jews than even Oskar Schindler.</i> I would like to see a category leaning towards genocidal war criminals. As a compromise, I've added a note about <b>totalitarian dictators</b> on the the <b>mass murderers</b> category page.</dd>
<dd>If this has been discussed previously, can someone point me to the thread?

<p>On a related note, while there may be "some" political scientists who do not regard the Nazi regime as totalitarian, as long as there are several reliable sources who do, I don't think it's appropriate to continue removing that category.--<b><a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClawson_a883.html" title="User:Clawson">chris.</a><a href="../../../c/l/a/User_talk%7EClawson_988f.html" title="User talk:Clawson">lawson</a></b> 21:56, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Many social scientists dispute the entire concept of totalitarian, saying that it lacks historical explanatory power. I'm not making that argument myself, but saying that it's one that Wikipeidia editors have no business getting into, given the NPOV policies and the policies against original research. To avoid making the call one way or another, Wikipedia editors can stick to terms that are not disputed. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 22:04, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While we're on the subject of category cruft, placing Hitler in the category of "LGBT right opposition" seems, well, pointless. We might as well put him in a category of racists, or a category of bigots, or a category of white supremacists. And what's "Nazi architecture" doing down there? Hitler wasn't an architect.--<b><a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClawson_a883.html" title="User:Clawson">chris.</a><a href="../../../c/l/a/User_talk%7EClawson_988f.html" title="User talk:Clawson">lawson</a></b> 22:04, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>From a scholarly perspective the term "totalitarian dictators" is hopelessly amateurish, journalistic shorthand. Given the structure of the government AH led, it's misleading and not helpful. "Fascist dictator" is closer, "fascist leader" is spot on. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 22:06, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Could John Kenney, or whoever else is supporting the vegetarian claim, provide a reputable source for the claim that H was a vegetarian, as opposed to someone who tried to reduce his meat intake?

<dd>I have. Even the biographers who say he was a vegetarian (the ones who are quoted) say he ate meat from time to time, which means he wasn't a vegetarian. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 08:42, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That's because agenda-pushers put together the original cites on the List of vegetarians page. Traudl Junge, his secretary, told lots of people (including the BBC) he didn't eat meat. Bee Wilson, a food writer for the Guardian, is cited in the article but nobody seems to bother to read the link to her article, where she describes his strict vegetarian regime (and ends with a "gotcha" anecdote about someone slipping bone marrow into his soup without his knowledge). <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 12:35, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've read in quite a few books that he was like 95% vegetarian and did eat meat <b>very occasionally</b>, like he might have a German bratwurst or blutwurst rarely -- apparently his diet was rather dull and quite repetitive, with him eating vegetable soup or something very similar like 5-6 days a week. He also drank sporadically, meaning he wasn't a complete <a href="../../../t/e/e/Teetotaler.html" title="Teetotaler">teetotaler</a> like he claimed to be...he had a <a href="../../../b/a/v/Bavarian.html" title="Bavarian">Bavarian</a> brewery brew him up a special beer with a VERY low-alcohol content when he became the <a href="../../../d/e/r/Der_F%C3%BChrer_851e.html" title="Der FÃ¼hrer">der FÃ¼hrer</a>, and he would also sip wine and champagne on special occasions and during certain meals. All of these myths about his diet and personality go back to the way the other Nazi leaders wanted to potray Hitler to the German populace and the World...they wanted to paint him as a self-denying <a href="../../../a/s/c/Ascetic.html" title="Ascetic">ascetic</a> who worked non-stop day and night for "The German people" and "the German Reich" and refused ALL luxuries and extras so that he might "get the job done quicker." This wasn't completely true at all, though SOME of it certainly was. (according to some sources he supposedly ate like a pound or more of chocolate/sweets every day!) <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.188.116.5.html" title="User:205.188.116.5">205.188.116.5</a> 11:04, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
