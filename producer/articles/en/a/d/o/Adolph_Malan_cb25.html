<p>Malan was born in <a href="../../../w/e/l/Wellington%2C_South_Africa_bf8f.html" title="Wellington, South Africa">Wellington</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/p/Cape_Province_c6ed.html" title="Cape Province">Cape Province</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a> . He joined the South African Training Ship "General Botha" in 1924 and 1925 as a cadet at the age of 15, (cadet number 168), after which he joined the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union-Castle_Line_fb92.html" title="Union-Castle Line">Union-Castle Line</a> of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Mercantile_Marine_Co._2474.html" title="International Mercantile Marine Co.">International Mercantile Marine Co.</a> which later earned him the nickname of "Sailor" amongst his pilot colleagues.</p>

<p>In 1935 the RAF started the rapid expansion of its pilot corps, and Malan was one of the people who joined up. He learned to fly on <a href="../../../t/i/g/Tiger_Moth_%28plane%29_7769.html" title="Tiger Moth (plane)">Tiger Moth</a> at an elementary flying school near <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol.html" title="Bristol">Bristol</a>, flying for the first time on January 6, 1936. He completed training by the end of the year, and was sent to join 74 Squadron on December 20, 1936. He was promoted to <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pilot_Officer_be76.html" title="Pilot Officer">Pilot Officer</a> in January 1937, and was appointed to acting Flight Commander of "A" Flight, flying Spitfires, in August. He received another promotion to <a href="../../../f/l/i/Flight_Lieutenant_db7d.html" title="Flight Lieutenant">Flight Lieutenant</a> just before the opening of the war.</p>

<p>74 Squadron saw its first action only 15 hours after war was declared, sent to intercept a bomber raid that turned out to be returning RAF planes. On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_6.html" title="September 6">September 6</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a> "A" Flight was scrambled to intercept a suspected enemy radar track and ran into the Hurricanes of <a href="../../../n/o/2E/No._56_Squadron_RAF_8058.html" title="No. 56 Squadron RAF">No. 56 Squadron RAF</a>. Believing 56 to be the enemy Malan ordered an attack and in the subsequent tragic battle pilots Paddy Byrne and John Freeborn shot two RAF aircraft down, killing one officer, Montague Hulton-Harrop. This <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friendly_fire.html" title="Friendly fire">friendly fire</a> incident of aircraft shooting at each other became known as the <i>Battle of Barking Creek</i>. At the subsequent <a href="../../../c/o/u/Courts_martial.html" title="Courts martial">courts martial</a>, the court accepted that the entire incident was an unfortunate error.</p>
<p><a name="Dunkirk" id="Dunkirk"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolph_Malan_cb25.html" title="Edit section: Dunkirk">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Dunkirk</span></h3>
<p>Events soon overtook the squadron. After fierce fighting over Dunkrik during <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Dynamo_2ab1.html" title="Operation Dynamo">the evacuation of Dunkirk</a> on June 28, 1940, Sailor was awarded the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Distinguished_Flying_Cross_%28UK%29_fd17.html" title="Distinguished Flying Cross (UK)">Distinguished Flying Cross</a> having achieved 5 'kill' claims. During this battle he first exhibited his fearless and implacable fighting spirit. In one incident he was able to coolly change the light bulb in his gunsight while in combat and then quickly return to the fray. During the night of 19/20 June Malan flew a night sortie in bright moonlight and shot down two <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heinkel_He-111_301d.html" title="Heinkel He-111">Heinkel He-111</a> bombers, a then unique feat for which a bar to his DFC was awarded.</p>
<p>Malan and his senior pilots also decided to abandon the "vic" formation used by the RAF, and turned to a looser formation based on the "finger four" that the <a href="../../../l/u/f/Luftwaffe.html" title="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> had developed just before the war started. Legend has it that on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_28.html" title="July 28">July 28</a> he met <a href="../../../w/e/r/Werner_M%C3%B6lders_79da.html" title="Werner Mölders">Werner Mölders</a> in combat, damaging his plane and wounding him, but failing to bring him down. Recent research has suggested however that Mölders was wounded in a fight with <a href="../../../n/o/2E/No._41_Squadron_RAF_6806.html" title="No. 41 Squadron RAF">No. 41 Squadron RAF</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolph_Malan_cb25.html" title="Edit section: Squadron Leader – 74 Squadron">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Squadron Leader – 74 Squadron</span></h3>
<p>On August 8th Malan was given command of 74 Squadron and promoted to Acting <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squadron_Leader_315c.html" title="Squadron Leader">Squadron Leader</a>. This was at the height of the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Britain_2389.html" title="Battle of Britain">Battle of Britain</a>. Three days later, on the 11th, action started at 7am when 74 was sent to intercept a raid near <a href="../../../d/o/v/Dover%2C_England_d626.html" title="Dover, England">Dover</a>, but this was followed by another three raids, lasting all day. At the end of the day 74 had claimed to have shot down 38 aircraft, and was known from then on as "Sailor's August the Eleventh". Malan himself simply commented, "<i>thus ended a very successful morning of combat</i>."</p>
<p>On the ground Malan was remembered as an inveterate gambler and often owed his subordinates money. Malan was older than most of his charges and although sociable and relaxed off duty spent most of his time with his wife and family living near Biggin Hill. He would soon develop a routine of flying the first sortie of the day and then handing the squadron to a subordinate while he stayed on the ground to do paperwork. Despite frosty relations after the Battle of Barking Creek he would often give command of the squadron to John Freeborn (himself an <a href="../../../f/l/y/Flying_ace.html" title="Flying ace">ace</a> of note), showing Malan's ability to keep the personal and professional separate. Malan commanded 74 Squadron with strict discipline and did not suffer fools gladly, and could be high-handed with sergeant pilots (many non-commissioned pilots were joining the RAF at this time). He could also be reluctant to hand out decorations, and he had a strict yardstick by which he would make recommendations for medals: six kills confirmed for a DFC, twelve for a bar to the DFC; eighteen for a DSO.</p>

<p>On December 24th Malan received the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Distinguished_Service_Order_3a2e.html" title="Distinguished Service Order">Distinguished Service Order</a>, and on July 22, 1941, Bars to the Order. On 10th March 1941 he was appointed as one of the first <a href="../../../w/i/n/Wing_Commander_%28rank%29_fd97.html" title="Wing Commander (rank)">Wing Leaders</a> for the offensive operations that spring and summer, leading the Biggin Hill Wing until mid August, when he was rested from operations. He finished his active fighter career in 1941 with 27 kills destroyed, 7 shared destroyed and 2 unconfirmed, 3 probables and 16 damaged, at the time the RAF's leading ace, and the one of the highest scoring pilots to have served wholly with Fighter Command during WW2.</p>

<p>After tours to the USA and the Central Gunnery School, Malan was promoted to <a href="../../../g/r/o/Group_Captain_0f86.html" title="Group Captain">Group Captain</a> in 1941 and became Station Commander at <a href="../../../b/i/g/Biggin_Hill_313b.html" title="Biggin Hill">Biggin Hill</a>. Malan remained keen to fly on operations, often ignoring standing orders for Station Commanders not to risk getting shot down. In October 1943 he became OC 19 Fighter Wing, <a href="../../../r/a/f/RAF_Second_Tactical_Air_Force_cf4c.html" title="RAF Second Tactical Air Force">2nd TAF</a>, then commander of the 145 (Free French) Fighter Wing in time for D-day, leading a section of the wing over the beaches during the late afternoon.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolph_Malan_cb25.html" title="Edit section: Rules of Air Fighting">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Rules of Air Fighting</span></h2>
<p>Although not an instinctive, gifted pilot Malan was an exceptional shot and a very aggressive air fighter, and above all a superb tactician who instilled the methods and techniques he had honed in 1940 into successive generations of young fighter pilots who followed him.</p>
<p>Malan developed a set of simple rules for fighter pilots, to be disseminated throughout <a href="../../../r/a/f/RAF_Fighter_Command_3603.html" title="RAF Fighter Command">RAF Fighter Command</a>, which eventually could be found tacked to the wall of most airbases:</p>
<p><b>TEN OF MY RULES FOR AIR FIGHTING</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Wait until you see the whites of his eyes. Fire short bursts of one to two seconds only when your sights are definitely "ON"</li>
<li>Whilst shooting think of nothing else, brace the whole of your body: have both hands on the stick: concentrate on your ring sight.</li>
<li>Always keep a sharp lookout. "Keep your finger out".</li>
<li>Height gives you the initiative.</li>
<li>Always turn and face the attack.</li>
<li>Make your decisions promptly. It is better to act quickly even though your tactics are not the best.</li>
<li>Never fly straight and level for more than 30 seconds in the combat area.</li>
<li>When diving to attack always leave a proportion of your formation above to act as a top guard.</li>
<li>INITIATIVE, AGGRESSION, AIR DISCIPLINE, and TEAM WORK are words that MEAN something in Air Fighting.</li>
<li>Go in quickly - Punch hard - Get out!</li>

<p>In 1946 Malan left the RAF and returned to South Africa. In the 1950s he formed a protest group of ex-servicemen called the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torch_Commando_16ee.html" title="Torch Commando">Torch Commando</a> to fight the National Party's plans to remove Cape's "coloured" voters from the roll. The Torch Commando fought a battle for more than five years, and at its height had 250,000 members. The government was alarmed by the number of judges, public servants and military officers joining the organisation that a new law was passed to ban anyone in public service or the military from joining.</p>
<p>Malan died in 1963 from <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parkinson%27s_Disease_38ed.html" title="Parkinson's Disease">Parkinson's Disease</a>, at the time a rare and essentially mysterious malady. A considerable sum of money was raised in his name to further study the disease, a fund that continues to this day.</p>
<p>He left his wife, Lynda, son Jonathan, and daughter Valerie.</p>
<p>In the 1969 war film <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Britain_%28film%29_f48e.html" title="Battle of Britain (film)"><i>Battle of Britain</i></a> the <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Shaw_%28actor%29_70d9.html" title="Robert Shaw (actor)">Robert Shaw</a> character 'Squadron Leader Skipper' was explicitly based on Malan, as recounted by <a href="../../../g/u/y/Guy_Hamilton_2b24.html" title="Guy Hamilton">Guy Hamilton</a> in the Special Edition DVD release of that film (2004), in the documentary 'A Film for the Few' included within that DVD release.</p>
