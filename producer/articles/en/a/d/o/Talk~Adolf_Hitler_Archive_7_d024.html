<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hitler and the church</span></h2>
<p>I find it odd that the material about Hitler and German churches is in the legacy section, but the content is helpful. I propose creating a new section in the article (just before or after the holocaust section) or... maybe a link to a new article, <i>Hitler and the church</i> would be appropriate. Thoughts anyone? <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 16:52, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hitler and the Churches is certainly a very interesting topic. Some of that should be in the <a href="../../../g/l/e/Gleichschaltung.html" title="Gleichschaltung">Gleichschaltung</a> article. But the churches in the Third Reich, especially the Catholic Church, e.g. the agreement of Hitler with the Pope is a topic that deserves special attention. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMale1979_76fc.html" title="User:Male1979">ben</a> 05:26, Feb 20, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>the Hitler article is already overloaded with the story of the Third Reich and WWII.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reviled</span></h2>
<p>Someone asked why the word's been called redundant... it's also used at the end of the article. I'd noticed it before and decided I didn't care, although normally an adjective like that shouldn't be repeated in a single article. Maybe substitute <i>loathed</i> or <i>hated</i> for one of them? It's certainly accurate. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 06:20, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I hadn't noticed that "reviled" was used again at the end. The lead section, acting as it does as an introduction to and summary of the rest of the article can repeat some of what follows. I don't have a problem with the repetition of the word "reviled", and "loathed" or "hated" are not quite synonymous. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> 13:56, Feb 20, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I not only dislike the redundancy and repitition, but feel that the placement in that particular sentance is poor prose. Neutrality is also an issue, no matter how unpopular the individual in question (and Hitler is arguably the most unpopular individual in history) we should strive to present them fairly, allowing the reader to form their own opinions. (<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> | <a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESam_Spade_3418.html" title="User talk:Sam Spade">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sam_Spade_c1db.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sam Spade">contributions</a>) 14:16, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I tend to agree, also regarding keeping a steady neutrality. The results of his efforts do speak for themselves (as noted above etc). <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 14:58, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am having trouble finding concrete information on the defeat of Hitler. The information I do find is sort of beating around the bush, and I need a soild answer, quick (the due date of the project I need this for is in 2 days). If you know of anything on the internet that states the exact way and aprox./exact(exact preferred) date he was defeated, can you please tell me? If you read this after February 20, 2005, don't bother, because I need it before them. I have one more question. I had never heard of this site before, and just found it yesterday while using a search engine to research about Hitler. I am a little speculative about the authenticity of the information on this site, seeing as how basically anyone is offered a chance to start an article about a subject that has not been used before. Is there someone who reviews the information and insures that it is not just a bunch of made-up stuff? <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dana.html" title="Dana">Dana</a> 16:33 February 20, 2005</p>

<p>No, his name is not Dana, that is my name, and I am a she. Do you have any information on the defeat of Hitler. Why should you have a user account (ie: necessary)</p>
<p>Hi Dana, welcome to Wikipedia. If you're looking for information on AH, you might want to read the article. After comparing it with other sources you should be able to decide for yourself how accurate it is, and how helpful it might be to you. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 23:16, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have read other information, and ithas said was repeatedly beat as a child, yet this article says that he just didn't like his father and his upbringing was normal for the time, was it normal for the time to give your child daily whippings? And then some say his whole family was also beat by his father, do you know if this is just an overexaggeration? -Dana</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm sorry, I should have been more clear. We all peer review each others work here, and since you are now involved this far, you have just as much right to verify information as anybody else. You don't <i>have</i> to form a user account, but it helps alot if you want to do stuff like edit. As far as your questions, I have no idea, a good % of what I know about Hitler is already in the article, the rest is mainly conjecture, as any stories about his upbringing are certain to be.

<dd>About AH's relationship with his father Alois, it was "normal" for boys at that time and place to receive punishment in the form of beatings (this sounds odd and cruel to most of us today). While young Adolph had arguments with his father, and was teased by him (again, not unusual) drawing any sort of causality between the sort of parental discipline he recieved and his later behavior is utter speculation. In principle, it's probably more significant that Alois died when Hitler was on the cusp of his teens but again, drawing a relationship between that event and AH's later life is ultimately guesswork. Taken as a whole, the disarray of his family and the early deaths of his parents probably played their part, and the article includes the documented facts pertaining to that. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 00:18, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Personally I take the word of Hitler himself, and his doctors. Hitler claims that he was inspired to believe as he did by observing the Autro-Hungarian empire, by reading tracts and opinionated newspapers, and by being suprised to discover Jews were an ethnicity as well as a religion, and that some of them were not German in his eyes (I think he <i>may</i> have been refering to hassidim, as he remarks that previously Jews had looked much like any other german, but that the Jews of the city did not). Also, his doctor suggests that he had syphillis, and regularly recieved methamphetimine injections. See <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitlers_medical_health.html" title="Hitlers medical health">Hitlers medical health</a> for more info. I seriously doubt his upbringing was of any great import.

<p>The drug aspect may be significant, starting at Pasewalk, the field hospital where he recovered from temporary blindness as the Great war ended. It appears he regularly took methamphetimine and cocaine through the 20s and 30s and 40s, both prescribed by doctors. Moreover, the essentially toxic "treatments" his personal physician Theo Morell was giving him by 1942 almost certainly had an effect on his behavior during the 39-45 war. There's a story that on July 20, 1944, a young doctor treated AH immediately after the bomb explosion with cocaine (swabs in the nose, as I recall), and was subsequently shocked to learn that one of the daily "drugs" Morell was giving Hitler was bella donna (a poison). By any account I've ever read Morell was a quack (not an assasin). So one can assume a likelyhood of some influence on his behavior but again, aside from that context, it's speculation. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 01:34, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I removed the Krockow paragraph about secrecy over Hitler's life, as it smacks of original research (a wiki no-no) and reads like a badly written college sophomore's term paper.</li>
<li>I removed the statement that Hitler was born "around 18:30 LMT" - who knows that? is it on his birth certificate? I find it speculatory and vague, and I doubt it will ever be verifiable.</li>
<li>I reorganized some of the section divisions in the article, as we had one title saying "biography", which had nothing to do with biography...just original research interpretations. I organized Biography into the section entitle "early life" putting "Childhood" "Early Years Vienna and Munich" and "First World War" as subsections.</li>

<dd>I saw that you again ignored that I asked for discussing some points and you just undid my changes. I wonder whether the talk page tells us more about dictatorship and democracy than the article. I saw in RequestedMove you called somebody an "annoying little gnat" 2 times with no reason, just because he/she asked for a discussion. Anyway, I take a time out, I was very upset to see the page two weeks ago because it was just so bad and I did a lot of changes. I see the page got better a lot. A lot of more changes are needed and I wanted to see for some, but I don't see a positive atmosphere and I don't have the time to just argue with some people who don't have the necessary understanding of democratic procedures or just culture of discussion.

<p>Two remarks... it's a historical fact Hitler was secretive about his genealogical origins, that they were rather more incestuous than "average" and took documented steps to research and "erase" parts of his past (whatever the reason, although the most recent scholarship tends to limit any possibility he was 1/4 Jewish, the existance of a doubt was political fodder for his opponents etc). Meanwhile, I'm all for paring down the article where possible, keeping in mind this is a way significant topic that merits a somewhat longer than average, but <i>succinct</i> bio/article. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 02:57, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I agree that something needs to be mentioned, but the two paragraphs I removed at the head of the bio article were poorly written, smacked of a sophomoric effort, and in my mind, were more an attempt to bring publicity to these two historian's theories rather than promote serious analysis of Hitler.

<p><b>Comment</b>, the bizarre edits by 203.36.44.13 regarding a "combover" along with gymnastics and pommel horses in elementary school have zero basis and were simple vandalism. <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHaham_hanuka_7d7e.html" title="User:Haham hanuka">Haham hanuka</a>, <i>fain</i> is an adverb, not an adjective. As for Geli, the documented evidence indicates she killed herself, probably because she felt trapped in a suffocating sexual relationship with a politically powerful uncle (keep in mind, AH's mother was his father's niece as well, so having that sort of interest in one of his own nieces probably wasn't much of a psychological stretch for him). Various rumours swirled around at the time but that's all they were. I removed the bit about AH spending many subsequent Xmas eves in Geli's former room in the Munich apartment not because I don't believe it (for all I know he may have done), but because it's not documented other than as anecdote and seems too granular for an encylopedia article. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 06:37, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think this is one of the few cases where "infamous" is actually justified.

<dd>AIDS is significant too (does that imply a favourable notion?), and I wouldn't call it an <i>infamous</i> auto-immune disease in an encyclopedia article. <i>Portentous</i> is even worse.

Comment: It's been my impression that one of AH's biggest issues with homosexuality was that he perceived it as an impediment to baby production (necessary for his vision of pan-Germanic expansion and redemption). It's also interesting that the leadership of the SA was populated by many gays when Hitler purged it, although his reasons for doing so seem to have been political. I imagine he also viewed "gay culture" (as we might call it today) as intrinsically subversive to what he was trying to accomplish. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 11:47, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, homosexuality wasn't a big theme of Hitler's at all, but he was of course perfectly happy to have them sent off to the camps along with whoever else public opinion made it expediant to be against. Its very telling that he waited until the last possible moment to purge <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernst_R%C3%B6hm_da41.html" title="Ernst Röhm">Ernst Röhm</a>, whom he personally liked and respected a great deal. The purge of Röhm and other "homosexuals" (I'm far from convinced their was anything more to that allegation than slander) had far more to do with the working class nature and leftist leanings of the SA and other <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strasserist.html" title="Strasserist">Strasserists</a> within the Nazi party than anything else.

<p>Having extensively re-written the article on Hitler's father <a href="../../../a/l/o/Alois_Hitler_2be7.html" title="Alois Hitler">Alois Hitler</a> (mostly for syntax and style), I realized that there were some minor errors about Alois in the main article. It was Alois who appeared before the priest, making an affidavit that his step-father was his biological father. I've also clarified the language about this in general: Hitler's grandfather was likely one of the Hiedler brothers (one married Alois' mother, the other played a huge role in raising him). The Frankenberger story (from which the "Hitler was Jewish" rumours have come) is now presented plainly as an interesting rumour with no basis in documented fact. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 18:08, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">An Uncontrolled Experiment - AH's Paintings</span></h2>
<p>Presented only for the amusement of readers of this talk page...</p>
<p>Ever since I was about twelve and saw a few paintings by AH in some book for the first time, I thought he had mild talent as a painter... above average, so to speak, even pleasing with buildings, landscapes and plants but oddly inept, even "creepy" when drawing people (maybe I wouldn't have <i>said</i> it that way when I was twelve, but I remember thinking it). Anyway, along with working on some of these AH-related articles during the past week, I stumbled across a website (linked from the main one here) with lots of AH paintings I'd never seen before. As usual, I found myself "sort of" liking some of them, but was slightly uncomfortable with his drawings of people (bear in mind, it's always hard for me to mentally disassociate AH artifacts from images of the camps and so on).</p>
<p>I should add that for me, most painters don't paint people with the convincing, stirring flair of a Waterhouse, Rockwell, Draper, Hacker or Dali, to name some broadly put "contemporaries" of AH with whom one might even begin to draw some sort of comparison.</p>
<p>So I chose a few scans of AH paintings that didn't involve people (flowers, buildings and landscapes), arranged them on the monitor display, made sure his name wasn't showing anywhere and called out to my friend who graduated from a respected European college with a four-year degree in fine arts... as a painter.</p>
<p>Me: So what do think of these?</p>
<p>Friend: Hmmm... wow!</p>
<p>Me: You like them?</p>
<p>Friend: These are great! Super!</p>
<p>After looking at them together for a minute or so, my friend paused, and said,</p>
<p>"These are by Adolf Hitler, aren't they?"</p>
<p>"Yep."</p>
<p>"They were crazy for rejecting him from art school."</p>
<p>I opened a few scans of architectural sketches by AH. The response was similar... talented and so on.</p>
<p>I brought up some portrait sketches of heads by AH.</p>
<p>Me: They're ok, I guess. About like any decent sketch artist at Montmartre...</p>
<p>Friend: Oh, better than that.</p>
<p>Finally, I brought up an AH nude (which I find slightly creepy), and while my friend liked it more than I did, we agreed the head was too small, among other details.</p>
<p>Either way, I think I can understand somewhat why he felt resentment at being rejected (twice) from attending a major art school. I think I can also see why someone told him he should try architecture. As his sister Paula said after the war, would that he had... <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 22:28, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Acronyms in opening</span></h2>
<p>I'm not sure what's with the back-and-forth on the opening, <i>leader of the National Socialist German Workers (Nazi) Party</i>.</p>
<p>Let's discuss this before changing it again, since some consensus editing was involved in getting it into the current form (remembering the need to keep the opening paragraph crisp).</p>
<p>The acronym NSDAP is certainly not too familiar to most English-speaking readers (not to say it's obscure, but it's certainly not "better known as"), for example and I can't remember one time when I've heard AH's political party referred to as the NSDAP in verbal conversation. I've seen it now and then in English texts, more so in German ones maybe.</p>

<p>I don't think National Socialist German Workers Party should be interrupted with the parenthetical "Nazi" as it currently written. Parentheticals belong after the terms being qualified, not in the middle. For all it is worth (given the etymological nature of the acronym), the parenthetical "Nazi" could logically belong as such: <i>National Socialist (Nazi) German Workers Party.</i> I prefer seeing it as <i>National Socialist German Workers Party (better known as the Nazi party)</i>. —<a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplorerCDT_cbe5.html" title="User:ExplorerCDT">ExplorerCDT</a> 16:31, 17 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>From a stylistic perspective, I don't think it's a problem. I think the alternate of putting the acronym in the middle of the name is a false dilemma and that "better known as " isn't necessary. There does seem to be some sort of a concern with how this reads, though, understandable with such an incendiary topic.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Visits abroad</span></h2>
<p>Is this section of the article really necessary...after all, despite omitting the rumoured trips to England in 1937/38 the drives through Prague, the trip to Italy, and a few others I can think of off the cuff, the section only has one entry that would probably be placed better in the WWII writeup and not as an autonomous section. —<a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplorerCDT_cbe5.html" title="User:ExplorerCDT">ExplorerCDT</a> 16:32, 17 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I was hoping someone might bring this up. No, I don't think this section is helpful. AH never visited the UK. His half brother lived there for a time (and passed some of it in prison for theft). The author of the book with that claim was an in-law and she later admitted to a family member most of it was made up, she was trying to spice up the book to make money- it didn't work btw (I remember playing a game of Trivial Pursuit and seeing a card that erroneously said he'd spent time in Liverpool). Hitler went to Italy and I think Spain (I've forgotten where that humiliating meeting with the wiley Franco was) on a very few state visits, he was in Belgium during the Great War along with France which he of course visited in 1940, too. That's about it... his famous, heavily secured eastern headquarters "Wolf's Lair" was in Poland... <i>Grossdeutschland</i> [sic] as far as he was concerned... I'd say remove it... <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 16:49, 17 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I think the section is a waste of space. Recent scholarship had alleged that Hitler journeyed to England in '37 or '38 and personally met with Chamberlain in private meetings discussing appeasement. Churchill's son has found some of his father's private papers mentioning "rumours" that selected British noblemen were key in perpetuating this treason, and that he knew of some of these meetings at the time. Whether or not those rumours are true are up to historians to substantiate, but more and more the rumours are sounding like they are. Hitler's going abroad was common, especially after his armies invaded. But in his encyclopedia article I don't think there should be a bullet-pointed travelogue...after all this isn't Ho Chi Mihn going to Paris in 1919 to try to corner Woodrow Wilson on the issue of Vietnamese self-determination. —<a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplorerCDT_cbe5.html" title="User:ExplorerCDT">ExplorerCDT</a> 18:09, 17 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">AH was a Nazi</span></h2>
<p>Bluntly put, "half" the time when one sees a reference to Germany's mad, ruinous dash to rule the world during the late 1930s and early 40s, it'll speak of <i>Nazis</i>, not <i>Germans</i>. The reasons for that are clear and Hitler by all accounts invented and unleashed the Nazi Party in his own image (never mind he started by taking over a tiny political group he'd orginally been sent to spy on). The full name in English was <i>National Socialist German Workers Party</i> and "everyone" called them <i>The Nazis</i> or the <i>Nazi Party</i>. <i>Hitler</i> and <i>Nazi</i> are linked like <i>DeSade</i> and <i>masochist</i>, <i>Einstein</i> and <i>relativity</i>, <i>John Lennon</i> and <i>Beatle</i> (no relative value judgements should be construed by the association of all these people in the same sentence). To omit the term in the opening para is to be incomplete or even misleading. Putting <i>Nazi</i> in parenthesis after the party's full name is self-explanatory in the extreme. Why the fuss? <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 05:00, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't mind the parenthetical, I just don't think that interrupting the flow of the party's name with a parenthetical is appropriate. Content bounded by a set of parentheses qualify a thought after it has been completed, not before it is finished. —<a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplorerCDT_cbe5.html" title="User:ExplorerCDT">ExplorerCDT</a> 05:16, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>But it is a component of the official name. You wouldn't call the American Telephone and Telegraph Corporation, as the <i>American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&amp;T) Corporation</i> just because you thought the Corporation part of the name was a throw away. (Though, the AT&amp;T article isn't the best example because of the improper use of a parenthetical in the article...IBM and GE are a better examples: <i>International Business Machines Corporation (IBM)</i> and <i>General Electric Company (GE)</i>...not <i>International Business Machines (IBM) Corporation</i> and <i>General Electric (GE) Company</i>).

<dd>I don't object. My only hesitation, as a matter of pure style, was repeating the word <i>party</i>, which at a minimum adds a problem that doesn't apply to the examples given by <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplorerCDT_cbe5.html" title="User:ExplorerCDT">ExplorerCDT</a> (it's <i>IBM</i>, not <i>IBM Corporation</i> and so on)... but so be it if the inter-parenthesis method doesn't work for some editors... this way is also ok by me. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 15:08, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>I don't object, but I think it is awkward to put it simply as [[National Socialist German Workers Party]] (Nazi Party). While I don't think it awkward to repeat <i>party</i> (as the guideline to never repeat a word within a sentence both is broken often and doesn't apply to parenthetical statements), when I reverted Nathan Ladd's removal of the fact, I put "<i>(known familiarly as the Nazi Party)</i>." I think there should be some <i>better known as</i>/<i>also known as</i>/<i>known familiarly as</i> to qualify the use of the parenthetical otherwise it would appear as an awkward construction. The other opportunity is to avoid putting in a parenthetical qualification here, and make the association later in the article. However, with the translation of <i>Führer und Reichskanzler</i> in the opening paragraph, the Nazi Party parenthetical statement belongs. —<a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplorerCDT_cbe5.html" title="User:ExplorerCDT">ExplorerCDT</a> 16:23, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Ok, I've tried to implement the two above suggestions. IMO it would also work with the parenthesis replaced by commas, that is...

<li>Strunk &amp; White like parenthetical clauses continuing the flow of the sentence being sectioned by commas.

<p>I've contracted the whole thing to Nazi Party; the Nazi link explains the meaning of the word, and the interior of the article is the place for detail. The intro shouldn't be full of nitpicking. I have also added a sentence about the expansionist foreign policy and the genocide, and its effect on Hitler's public image in the modern world--his "most hated leader" status. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 19:14, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>That last sentence you added about the "most hated leader" status is definitely not NPOV, though any reasonable human being already accepts it as a given, it smacks of smug bias. Secondly, Nazi is an abbreviation...abbreviations aren't appropriate at first. You qualify the abbreviation (as we have done), and then afterwards using the abbreviation is o.k. Thirdly, there are objective nuances that are not just overshadowed but trounced upon simply abbreviating it to "Nazi Party" from the get-go. The intro paragraphs are where they are because of consensus work. They also have been nitpicked in order to have the maximum dynamic without resorting to the all-too-easy POV statements you tried to edit in. —<a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplorerCDT_cbe5.html" title="User:ExplorerCDT">ExplorerCDT</a> 20:18, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Regarding Tony's additional sentence, I belive that something additional is necessary to balance two favorable sentences in the intro: <i>A <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charisma.html" title="Charisma">charismatic</a> orator, Hitler is regarded as one of the most significant <a href="../../../l/e/a/Leadership.html" title="Leadership">leaders</a> in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_history.html" title="World history">world history</a>.

For the introductory paragraph to paint a full picture of Hitler it is necessary to include the very large warts. He is not famous because of his economic policies and the war he began led to the ruin of Germany, so any economic benefits were shortlived. I don't think that it violates the NPOV rule to point out in the intro that legacy includes the Holocaust, etc. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 21:38, Mar 18, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't think my wording can be fairly described as POV. "...he is now widely regarded as one of the most hated national leaders in history." It's a factual statement and one of the most significant things about Hitler. His name is a by-word for brutal, inhuman barbarism. Note that I'm describing the legacy of the man, it's a fact that he is widely viewed in this light. I'm not saying he does or doesn't deserve that reputation, I'm observing a highly significant fact about the man.</p>
<ul>
<li>I feel it's POV, and I try to give a lot of latitude on that one. As to being "most hated" that's a judgment call, but coming out and saying he was among the most reviled is still stating an opinion of the man. A good portion of the world, for some stupid reason, reveres him something like a God who was right in massacring Jews (or those who don't think the Holocaust took place at all) and don't think he was brutal, but just. While whitewashing him is never acceptable, making blanket statements that Hitler was the epitome of evil incarnated into man is just a little too much...even if it is generally regarded true.

<p>On "Nazi", it's the English name for his party, whereas "National Socialist German Workers' Party" is simply a literal translation of the official German name. In practise his party is known as the Nazi Party. This familiar word should appear in the introduction. Save the nuances for the interior of the article and the link.</p>
<ul>
<li>No, Nazi is just an abbreviation. Before he became the "enemy," most American papers (especially Hearst papers) refered to him as the National Socialist leader. National Socialist German Workers Party is the full name of the party. The familiar word does appear in the introduction as a parenthetical qualification to the National Socialist German Workers Party. In practice, anything can be known by abbreviations, but the fact remains the party had a full name, and it is standard stylistically to mention that full name before going off and using the abbreviation. The nuances are properly placed, here, we lay out the facts and the fact is the Nazi Party was the National Socialist German Workers Party. —<a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplorerCDT_cbe5.html" title="User:ExplorerCDT">ExplorerCDT</a> 22:53, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of all those months of discussion appears to have been that the introduction somehow managed to omit the two most significant facts about Adolf Hitler: that he waged genocide against the Jews and Gypsies (and Slavs), and that his name is synonymous in the minds of most people of post-war generations with brutality and barbarism. Those are facts, and significant ones. To state the latter is not to state an opinion, but to state a fact about an opinion. And a highly significant one. As <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> puts it: "assert facts, including facts about opinions — but don't assert opinions themselves."</p>
<p>The article introduction as it now stands is hopelessly POV, falsely depicting a world statesman who is remembered only for his charisma, his political acumen, and the fact that he was on the losing side in a big war. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 23:04, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Where does it call him a statesman? Where does it say he is remembered only for his charisma? The article concludes characterizing him as "reviled" by most historians. It also clearly places responsibility for the holocaust on his shoulders, summarizes what that was, calling it industrial scale genocide, and links to the main article. By starting the article with an evaluation of legacy, one reduces the murderer to the level of a cartoon, making it more difficult for people to learn how to spot the next one who comes along. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 23:16, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Actually the wording is mealy-mouthed and passive "encouraged..." and racial policies "which reached their peak..." as if the policies themselves were doing something while Hitler was just hanging out.

<dd>Why do the assertions about his charisma and economic savvy need to be in the intro anyway? All of those are also listed in the main text. To sum up his legacy by mentioning his leadership without, in the same breath, mentioning his faults furthers a particular point of view, IMO. If the destruction of Germany does not belong in the intro then neither does his economic achievement. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 23:47, Mar 18, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reviled</span></h2>
<p>Wyss, we're talking about the introduction to the article, the part that's supposed to provide a summary of the article. If you agree that he is widely reviled, let's put it in the intro.</p>
<p>I said the intro implied he was remembered only for "his charisma, his political acumen, and the fact that he was on the losing side in a big war." I say that because that's what the intro says. It mentions "racial policies", but it doesn't mention genocide. It says he "encouraged" racial policies, but it doesn't say that he, Adolf Hitler, as his country's leader, was one of those who planned and executed the killing of millions of people on grounds of race (and for other reasons, such as eugenics). Again you appeal to detail in the article that reveal highly significant facts that aren't presented in the intro.</p>
<p>Finally we're here to write an encyclopedia article, not to write a didactic piece or a polemic. The introduction should contain a mention (not an evaluation) of Hitler's legacy, because that is the most significant remaining thing about his influence in the modern world--whether rightly or wrongly--as a symbol of evil, often a caricature. That's a highly significant fact about Hitler that doesn't (remarkably) attach itself so readily to butchers whose deeds were probably the equal of, or exceeded, Hitler's. Mao and Stalin pale into insignificance in the public mind, it's Hitler we remember as the terrible architect of genocide. That fact belongs in the introduction. We can make it as neutral as possible, but we shouldn't weasel it away. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 00:06, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>As it's written, here are the most significant facts about Adolf Hitler:</p>
<ol>
<li>His lifespan.</li>
<li>He led the Nazi party "during the Third Reich."</li>
<li>He was a charismatic orator.</li>
<li>He was one of the most "significant" leaders in world history.</li>
<li>He "fostered" a military-industrial complex that caused Germany's economic recovery</li>
<li><i>The military-industrial complex</i> for a time controlled Europe</li>
</ol>
<p>Tony's right. Not only are these <i>not</i> the most significant facts to mention in a summary, they assert a passivity in Hitler's life and career that are very apologist. "During the Third Reich" makes it sound like that was something external happening while Hitler <i>happened</i> to be in charge. Saying he was "significant" (though accurate) puts him there with Roosevelt, Churchill, the better Popes and Emperors, etc. Saying he "fostered" (an interesting word implying caring parenting) a military-industrial complex is a doublespeak way of saying he militarized Germany, and saying <i>the military-industrial complex</i> controlled Europe is just inaccurate, when it was being controlled by people, chief among which was Hitler.</p>
<p>Omitting the Holocaust from this summary, or any implication that people might have a negative opinion of him, is POV in the extreme. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemi_6641.html" title="User:Demi">Demi</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/e/m/User_talk%7EDemi_ab67.html" title="User talk:Demi">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Demi_a1b0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Demi">C</a></sub> 00:38, 2005 Mar 19 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>"regarded" -&gt; "widely regarded": This isn't totally necessary, but turns the text from appearing POV into a fact about opinion.</li>
<li>"reviled" added: It is a fact that he is widely reviled and is already stated near the end of the article. The intro is a summary and should... summarize.</li>
<li>removal of economic crisis part: Until someone cites economic historians on this issue, it shouldn't be included, as it is disputed. Economic crises eventually end because the market adjusts to the shock; the relationship to increased employment isn't necessarily causal. They're both determined by other things. (I thank my math/econ friend for clearing this up) "Things like technology shocks, terms of trade shocks, and monetary changes are the drivers" [for increased employment and economic crises], but one does not necessarily follow the other. --&#160;<span class="plainlinks"><small><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><font color="#000000"><b>BRIAN</b></font></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#555555">0918</font></a></small>&#160; 00:51, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)</span></li>
<li>primary cause in europe: "War began in Europe on 1 September 1939 with the German invasion of Poland." (from the WWII article) Just because the events of the war are lumped together under one name "WWII" doesn't mean it is useful to lump all of the causes and regions involved together. For Germany, WWII was primarily in Europe.</li>
<li>encouraged-&gt;instituted: Hitler was not on the sidelines; these were policies, not opinions, and they were enforced. --&#160;<span class="plainlinks"><small><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><font color="#000000"><b>BRIAN</b></font></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#555555">0918</font></a></small>&#160; 00:51, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)</span></li>
<li>"a" Holocaust -&gt; "the" Holocaust: Because the term is capitalized in the text "genocidal Holocaust", it is referring to the Holocaust of WWII, instead of a holocaust.

<p>I changed a few things. Hitler didn't invent Nazi Germany's racial policy, so I changed "invented" to "implemented." Anti-Semitism was in Europe long before AH was born, and all he did in his speeches and in Mein Kampf was crystallize some of it. Most of the policy making fell on his subordinates throughout the Third Reich. Globke, Eichmann, Himmler, Goebbels (esp. developing the propaganda), and a whole bunch of scientists (including pseudoscientists like "eugenicists") and statisticians. —<a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplorerCDT_cbe5.html" title="User:ExplorerCDT">ExplorerCDT</a> 16:20, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline">Comments by Wyss on my changes</span></h4>
<p>Here are Wyss's comments on my changes, copied from his talk page:</p>
<ul>
<li>The removal of the brief mention about his perceived economic influence utterly distorts reality. Germans not only thought he was saving Germany, they thought he'd improve their quality of life (although <i>living standards</i> was the wonted term back then, I believe). They supported him because they thought he'd helped turn the economy around (in the 1920s, people carted wheelbarrows filled with nearly worthless paper currency to buy groceries- at the worst of it, people sold pianos for sausages), never mind this happened as a result of many complex factors including massive spending of borrowed money on military re-development.
<ul>
<li>Germans may have perceived him as ending the economic crisis, as you state, but it is not necessarily factual. Your version didn't make that distinction ("The <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military-industrial_complex.html" title="Military-industrial complex">military-industrial complex</a> he fostered pulled Germany out of the post-<a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> economic crisis..."). See my statements on the talk page about this. --&#160;<span class="plainlinks"><small><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><font color="#000000"><b>BRIAN</b></font></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#555555">0918</font></a></small>&#160; 22:04, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Perception is way important to voters and supporters, and he did foster a military-industrial complex, and it did <i>help</i> to pull Germany out of the post-war depressions. Hitler's perceived economic role in Germany is essential to understanding his political successes during the 1930s.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><i>A charismatic orator, Hitler is widely regarded as one of the most significant and</i> <b>reviled</b> <i>leaders in world history.</i>
<ul>
<li>Sure he's reviled. However, for the alert reader, words like <i>beloved</i> or <i>reviled</i> in the opening paras of a bio reveal bias, and bring the accuracy and "spin" (if you will) of the remaining content into some question. The use of such terms should be carefully qualified, as is the use of the word <i>reviled</i> at the end of the article, where it should be (now repeated, not at all a clean thing to do). Also, there is a moral issue with human revilement/hatred (as AH's politics themselves demonstrated), never mind when it's extended beyond a personal scope as in an encyclopedia article. Finally, from <i>reviled</i> it's not too far to "strutting dictator with a funny little mustache." The people who allowed him to gain power and consolidate it didn't see him that way. The article should reflect that, it's one of the reasons why the horror happened.
<ul>
<li>As supported on <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and reiterated a few times on Hitler's talk page, phrases like "widely regarded as reviled" are facts about well-documented opinions. From WP:NPOV: "assert facts, including facts about opinions — but don't assert opinions themselves". It is not biased, as is stated on the talk page.</li>

<li>Also, I see no problem with the same word being used twice in the article and think you're pulling at strings with that specific argument. Introductions and conclusions often involve repetition.

<li>Ok, I've changed the 2nd usage to "reproved" which is very close in meaning. If you would like a different word in the "Legacy" section, please change it, but the use of "reviled" in the intro is supported by several, so please leave that alone. I'll respond to the rest later, time for food.&#160;:) --&#160;<span class="plainlinks"><small><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><font color="#000000"><b>BRIAN</b></font></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#555555">0918</font></a></small>&#160; 23:08, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)</span></li>

<li><i>He implemented the racial policies of Nazi Germany and instituted the genocidal Holocaust of millions of Jews, Gypsies and Slavs.</i>
<ul>
<li>First, the term <i>Holocaust</i> really only applies to the genocide of European Jews during that period (although I imagine some might argue that point, it's easier just to apply it to the crimes against Jews).
<ul>
<li>From the first line of <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a>: "The Holocaust refers to Nazi Germany's systematic genocide of various ethnic, religious, national, and secular groups during World War II starting in 1941 and continuing through to 1945." If it had said "Final Solution" then I might suggest changing it, as the Solution only applied to Jews.

<li>He enabled those racial policies, but this wording gives him credit for inventing them. Truth is, he spent his twenties reading (not writing) virulently anti-semetic magazines that would make an iman blush. Have you ever seen the cartoons? Germany, especially Barvaria, was ripe for genocide by the end of the Great War. AH had the political saavy to grok and run with it. There's another tricky problem and perhaps it's only one of form because we all know he was behind the authorizations for industrial scale slaughter in the camps but there's no paper trail (it was obviously either avoided or burned in the spring of 1945). We know the Holocaust happened, we know for sure he wanted, enabled and encouraged it but we don't know exactly how, except that for the most part, planning and execution were handled by others (Himmler and Heydrich, for example). The Holocaust section of the article is accurate by the way, and links to the larger main article on that topic.</li>

As he was on top, "enforced" might be better, it's passive in that it doesn't suggest he originated everything (although most agree he did), but it suggests he went out of his way to answer the "Jewish question", thus his Final Solution (something which I still think should be added to the intro). Right now, though, I'd suggest leaving it as is. More people support not using "encouraged" than using it. --&#160;<span class="plainlinks"><small><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><font color="#000000"><b>BRIAN</b></font></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#555555">0918</font></a></small>&#160; 22:04, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)</span></li>

<dd>Let's not use <i>enforced</i> at least... he didn't enforce the law, that was the job of the SS (for example). <i>Enabled</i> doesn't sound passive to me, but I understand how it might to others. That's why I liked <i>encouraged</i> (ties in with his oratory and so forth)... really, even though there's no paper trail, I'd say <i>he is believed to have ordered</i> rather than <i>instituted</i>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Shoah</span></h2>
<p>I had a discussion with Tony Sidaway on IRC, and it seemed his problem with the intro saying "the Holocaust" was that it left out "genocide", which according to him is "the most important word". Another problem for him was that the word "holocaust", according to him, didn't come into popular usage as being the word for the 1945 genocide until the 1970s, and the word was popular before then. My problem with his version was that it didn't link directly to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Holocaust_8edb.html" title="The Holocaust">The Holocaust</a>, leaving out an important link. So, we agreed that the best way to clear this up would be to use the term which is accepted by Jews and by the Catholic Church as being the proper word for "The Holocaust" (they don't prefer "holocaust" because its original meaning, as is used in the Bible, is that of a "burnt offering [to a god]", implying that the Nazis was in fact doing the proper work of the Judeo-Christian God.) Since "Shoah" is accepted by two major groups (and arguably the most important groups in this event as far as religion and the origins of anti-Semitism are concerned), and since Shoah links directly to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Holocaust_8edb.html" title="The Holocaust">The Holocaust</a>, it is probably the best choice, despite the term not being commonly used among laypeople. --&#160;<span class="plainlinks"><small><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><font color="#000000"><b>BRIAN</b></font></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#555555">0918</font></a></small>&#160; 21:26, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</span></p>

<dd>I'm sorry to have become a party to what may seem odd--a discussion on IRC that is cited as influencing an edit on Wikipedia. I just told Brian that I didn't find Shoah, which was Brian's suggestion, an unreasonable word to use, although I think it's not as common a word as Holocaust, and that in any case I think the word genocide should be specifically included in any introduction to Adolf Hitler. The word holocaust, although it has specific meanings with respect to the Shoah, also has a more general meaning. I'm presently trying to perform a wikipedia-wide disambiguation of the two usages. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 22:08, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Because the term is capitalized in the text "genocidal <b>H</b>olocaust", it is referring to <i>the</i> Holocaust, instead of <i>a</i> holocaust. This is not just my opinion, but is regarded as proper usage among scholars on this subject (I'm taking a course on The Holocaust right now and both of my textbooks on the subject support this distinction). --&#160;<span class="plainlinks"><small><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><font color="#000000"><b>BRIAN</b></font></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#555555">0918</font></a></small>&#160; 22:09, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)</span></p>

<li>But the disambiguation proves there is a need to differentiate between this and other Holocausts...many of which as the disambiguation page proves, uses a capital "H." As there are many holocausts in history (and several in fact, regarding the genocidal treatment of the Jewish people) it is inappropriate to use a definite article to describe one of those many. Not all scholars agree on this point, as you so naïvely assume...just take a quick look at the German historians who are still afraid to broach the subject boldly. —<a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplorerCDT_cbe5.html" title="User:ExplorerCDT">ExplorerCDT</a> 23:28, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Those holocausts are prefixed with terms (eg Chinese, or Black), whereas <i>the</i> Holocaust is not.

<p>Both usages are acceptable, but it is probably more sensible to refer to the Shoah as "a holocaust" since the term long precedes the Shoah and has historically (and in my personal experience) been used in multiple contexts. Anyone who thinks there is one "holocaust", or that the Shoah is "the holocaust" obviously hasn't lived long enough or has insufficient knowledge of the classical Greek origins of the word "holocaust" and its usage throughout the modern age. If you want to make the Shoah unique, do as fr.wikipedia does and refer to it as the Shoah. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 02:10, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't disagree with its accuracy. It is a remarkable word when you look at it from its usage in Hebrew. But, aside from Spielberg's oral history, and occasional utterances of it, there's really no means by which it has been imparted to the larger audience...unlike Holocaust. However, when I first hear the word "Holocaust," I don't think of the WWII genocide. Thought it is a second thought, my primary thought is of "nuclear holocaust" but that's mostly from my focus on Cold War military matters.

<li>I should probably not feed the troll, but I need to defend my position. I was alright with "genocidal Holocaust" provided that "Holocaust" linked to "The Holocaust". Tony Sidaway, however, was not, which is perfectly acceptable. Shoah is the preferred term of notable Jews and is the accepted term of the Catholic Church, and so is not a minority opinion. Mine was a compromise with Tony Sidaway; we both agreed on the current version. He is currently planning on writing a separate article for <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">holocaust</a> which will explain the origins of the term, its usage, and how it came to be associated with <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Holocaust_8edb.html" title="The Holocaust">The Holocaust</a>, so right now is disambiguating the words throughout Wikipedia.

As for Shoah..."notable Jews" isn't the whole world...just a small segment of a smaller ethnic group (a few million people worldwide) and that further proves the inclusive nature of the word's impact. If it weren't for the documentary oral history Steven Spielberg made after making <i>Schindler's List</i> or my friendship with several Jewish intellectuals, I wouldn't have heard of the word "Shoah" in the first place. It's just not used by the majority of the world. The Catholic Church isn't much more credible either because Pope Pius XII had a swastika rosary given to him by Der Führer, did nothing to stop the madman, endorsed his efforts, and they'll do anything now to patch things up and make themselves look good (though I do think Pope John Paul II's concilatory efforts are genuine, the church itself is mired in a hypocrisy that knoweth no bounds).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Article Treats the German Populus unfairly</span></h2>
<p>The article portrays the German populus in an unfairly bad light, particularly in the section om repression pre-war. Mention should be made that a) Anti-Semitism was by no means a uniquely German phenomenon and b) The public did not for a very long time give ACTIVE support to Nazi measures: One could mention the resounding failure of the April Boycott or the fact that Krystalnacht and similiar lower level violence was carried out almost entirely by the SA before the propaganda really started to hit home about 1938. Also, this section also seems to seek to create the impression that pre-war Germany was a pure terror state, which is simply incorrect. <a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKharBevNor_ad72.html" title="User:KharBevNor">User:KharBevNor</a> <small>(sig added by (<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> | <a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESam_Spade_3418.html" title="User talk:Sam Spade">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sam_Spade_c1db.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sam Spade">contributions</a>) 09:17, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC))</small></p>

I guess bashing a man's skull in, branding a swastika into his forehead, ripping out hair from a guy's beard, etc. don't count as instruments of terror (See <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erich_M%C3%BChsam_49f0.html" title="Erich Mühsam">Erich Mühsam</a> for more) when the world media were reporting them week after week before Hitler showed up in Prague in an open car. —<a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplorerCDT_cbe5.html" title="User:ExplorerCDT">ExplorerCDT</a> 06:08, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>In the pre-war impression section. It's a sin of ommission mainly. Also, the early nazi state was not a pure terror state. the Nazis used a hell of a lot of carrot with their stick, and the life of the majority of the German people (basically all the groups not being discriminated against: ie the average German) was improved over the final years of Weimar. <a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKharBevNor_ad72.html" title="User:KharBevNor">User:KharBevNor</a>

<li>It seems disingenuous to say Hitler was the cause of WW2. He was merely a product of the Treaty of Versailles.

<li>I agree that "causality" is kind of a slippery concept. However, Germany's expansion by assuming control of and invading other European countries (led by Hitler) was certainly the proximate cause. I'd be tempted to use the term "proximate" in the article but I think that's less understandable than what's there now. Most people reading the paragraph, in my opinion, would expect to see causality in a direct sense, rather than an indirect or non-proximate sense (the Treaty of Versailles itself having its own causes, so one could go back, cause by cause to even earlier events). <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemi_6641.html" title="User:Demi">Demi</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/e/m/User_talk%7EDemi_ab67.html" title="User talk:Demi">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Demi_a1b0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Demi">C</a></sub> 18:01, 2005 Apr 13 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hitler wasn't at least an atheist, and like his idol Wagner, he seems to have believed in a path set by the creator. I am not sure how Christian he was, but he didn't condemn Christianity. So does that mean he didn't consider Jesus to be Jewish? Jesus was, according to history, born as a Jew, regardless of how he later distanced himself from the law of the Jews. Was Hitler familiar with the Christian monk Martin Luther's essay "On the Jews and Their Lies", who condemned Jews regardless of his devotion to Jesus? (anon)</dd>

<p>What will always irk me linguistically is the phrase "genocidal Holocaust". Is there any other kind?

<li>My concern was that the term holocaust isn't self-evidently genocidal--it could just describe a really devastating event. The common term <i>nuclear holocaust</i>, for instance, which would be more in the nature of a strategic deterrence strategy gone wrong and doesn't really have any genocidal elements. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 16:16, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, but we're not talking about "a holocaust" here, in the meaning derived from the original event (which, in terms like "nuclear holocaust" indeed has nothing to do with genocide <i>per se</i>), we're talking <i>the</i> Holocaust, definite article, capital H, architectured by mr. Hitler. Calling that "genocidal" looks as silly as "devastating" would look for any holocaust. Implying that we need "genocidal" to make sure exactly <i>what</i> sort of holocaust is talked about, just in case the reader is thinking of mushroom clouds or indeed just any mass killing when reading about <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> being responsible for "the Holocaust" seems a bit off the mark.

The Holocaust was genocide. "The genocidal Holocaust" is doubly bad because "genocide" is so closely linked to "Holocaust" in its origins. But as I said, it's unlikely any amount of argument will settle this, as it seems to boil down to personal taste, and we all know what they say about taste... <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> 17:41, 2005 Apr 24 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Alright, I sort-of see your point. My problem is that I cannot imagine someone who knows what "genocidal" means but has never heard of the Holocaust. No, scratch that—I cannot imagine anyone who's never heard of the Holocaust, although I know my imagination is getting in my way here, because such people must exist (there must be areas of the world where WWII in its entirety is languishing in obscurity, as hard to envision as this is for me).<br />
That <i>said</i>, I still don't see why my idea of explicitly referring to the Holocaust as a genocide, rather than tagging it "genocidal", has no merit. (I'm arguing from silence here, obviously.&#160;:-) Are people really supposed to go "gee, I didn't know holocausts could be genocidal, let's click on that link"? I'd rather think they'd go "what's 'genocidal'"? In that sense, I'd like to give "genocide" prominence of its own, not an off-handed adjectival mention. What you are effectively doing here is explaining very briefly what the Holocaust entailed, which is good, but then you're also doing it very off-handedly, which is not so good, and causes irritation among people who <i>do</i> know what the Holocausts was and what genocide is (well, with "people" I only mean "me", obviously.&#160;:-) Hope this clears up my POV. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> 19:29, 2005 Apr 24 (UTC)</dd>

Therefore, why not just make it "mass murder", "a holocaust", "an organised extermination" or something along those lines (note: not <b>the</b> holocaust, but <b>a</b> holocaust, since there have been various other holocausts such as the Native American Holocaust, the Yugoslavia Holocaust, the Rwanda Holocaust, and so on). Keeping it as "genocidal Holocaust" (why the capital letter H by the way?) would not include the mass murder of homosexuals and Hitler's political opponents, as none of the two things depend on genes. --<a href="../../../h/j/v/User%7EHJV_25e2.html" title="User:HJV">HJV</a> 21:56, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So your POV does? Virtually everyone who has studied the holocaust in some depth must have noticed how the only proof that there is of these "6 million" being killed are some testimonies got by beating the living s*it out of the suspect, and some physical "proof" not proving anything at all. I do know that thousands of Jews and other people died on these camps, and that even <i>one</i> dead is one too many, but due to the lack of proof a specifid number should not be announced, as long as there is a clear lack of solid proof for this number. The International Red Cross Committee (section of war crimes or something, cant remember examtly) published an investigation stating that around 66 000 we killed in Auschwitz, but it got soon pulled back and put into the secret archives.

<p>The number factors in people who were pretty much as gentile as it gets but, were killed for 1/16 or 1/32 jewish ancestory. The number of religious Jews killed was lower but, i think the number should stick because the people who were killed for being 1/32 Jewish were still killed for being presumably Jewish.</p>
<p>The Encyclopedia Judiaca (not sure if I spelled that correctly) has an article explaining the origins of the "6 million" figure. Its been years since I read it, but the most important method used was comparative census data. An exhaustive examination of pre- and post-war censuses in Europe and elsewhere (including what is now Israel), showed that more than 6 million Jews listed in pre-war censuses had dissappeared from the face of the earth at the end of the war. When adjustments are made to account for Jews killed in the war by causes other than murder, the total was about 6 million. --<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENathan_Ladd_432f.html" title="User:Nathan Ladd">Nate Ladd</a> 08:55, May 1, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hitler was a leftist!</span></h2>
<p>There seems to be a much confusion about what leftism actually is. According to the conventional wisdom of the day, Hitler was overwhelmingly socialist, although not at all extreme as a socialist. The claim that Hitler was "rightist" falsely connects his radical nationalism with unrelated liberitarian capitalism. Readers need to be informed of this so as to clear up and prevent further misunderstandings. In my argument I refer to this article:</p>
<p><a href="http://jonjayray.netfirms.com/hitler.html" class="external free" title="http://jonjayray.netfirms.com/hitler.html" rel="nofollow">http://jonjayray.netfirms.com/hitler.html</a></p>
<p>Here's one quote which might inspire some thoughts, but there's much more to it in the whole article: ""That does however raise the question of WHY such thinking is seen as "Rightist" today. And the answer to THAT goes back to the nature of Leftism! The political content of Leftism varies greatly from time to time. The sudden about-turn of the Left on antisemitism in recent times is vivid proof of that. And what the political content of Leftism is depends on the Zeitgeist -- the conventional wisdom of the day. Leftists take whatever is commonly believed and push it to extremes in order to draw attention to themselves as being the good guys -- the courageous champions of popular causes. So when the superiority of certain races was commonly accepted, Leftists were champions of racism. So when eugenics was commonly accepted as wise, Leftists were champions of eugenics -- etc. In recent times they have come to see more righteousness to be had from championing the Palestinian Arabs than from championing the Jews so we have seen their rapid transition from excoriating antisemitism to becoming "Antizionist".

<dd>I'm not sure it's helpful to make a big thing of whether Hitler was 'leftist' or 'rightist'. As you say, the exact definition of these terms vary from time to time and place to place. Rather than saying "Hitler was a leftist" would it not be better to give a description of his beliefs and policies and leave the reader to decide which pigeon-hole, of any, to put him in? <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 20:23, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hysterical blindness?</span></h2>
<p>The current text says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>On October 15, 1918, shortly before the end of war, Hitler was admitted to a field hospital, temporarily blind following a poison gas attack. Recent research however indicates the blindness may have been the result of an hysterical reaction to Germany's military defeat.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This doesn't sound right. According to Kershaw's Hubris, p. 96-97:</p>
<dl>
<dd>On the night of 12-14, October, Hitler fell victim to mustard gas on the heights south of Wervick, part of the southern front near Ypres. He and several comrades, rereating from their dug-out during a gas-attack, were partially blinded by the gas and found their way to safety only by clinging on to each other and following a comrade who was slightly badly afflicted. After initial treatment in Flanders, Hitler was transported on 21 October 1918 to the military hospital in Pasewalk, near Stetting, in Pomerania.</dd>
</dl>
<p>AFAIK, the temporary blinding effect of <a href="../../../m/u/s/Mustard_gas.html" title="Mustard gas">mustard gas</a> is well known. See: <a href="../../../u/s/e/Use_of_poison_gas_in_World_War_I_7c33.html" title="Use of poison gas in World War I">Use of poison gas in World War I</a>.

<dd>I think a lot of my edits have been removed, when I didn't come back any more to check. So, to add some background to the edit, I copyedited the following paragraphs from de (in keywords):</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Before the end of the war, after a gas attack, Hitler was instutionalized in the military hospital at Pasewalk. He argued in Mein Kampf that the temporary blindness, because of which he was treated, was caused by the gas. Newer research, based on the hospital's records, also give way for speculations, the blindness may have been a hysterical reaction to Germany's military defeat. In any case, Hitler was treated by a psychiatrist and classified as a psychopath, uncapable for leadership.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>His superior is cited with "I will never promote this hysteric!" (Heiden [5][source of the German article). Therefore, it was not only because of Hitler's austrian citizenship, he was never promoted beyond the Gefreiter (private first class), inspite of being wounded several times and being awarded the Eiserne Kreuz of both classes and other honors. Sebastian Haffner calls his time in the military "the only educational event in his life".</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That was more or less what I copyedited back then. My goal back then was more generally to remove the strong NPOV in favor of Hitler. If you see the next section on this page here, you will find, that some things have been changed again back to where it was, many things remained though. It is important for this article especially, what kind of sources you cite. I think, about this guy, nearly anything possible has been written, so a lot depends on your choice of sources. The German is more anti-Hitler in tendency than the article here. I was criticed and reverted a lot when I introduced these and other changes. So, anyway, I just posted a request for sources on the German discussion page and tell you if anything comes up. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMale1979_76fc.html" title="User:Male1979">Ben</a> <a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMale1979_96ca.html" title="User talk:Male1979">talk</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Male1979_fd02.html" title="Special:Contributions/Male1979">contr</a> 07:33, May 6, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Mustard gas <i>and</i> hysterical?</span></h3>
<p>Thanks for digging up the source. However, I think the current version of the text is misleading (even if that source is trustworthy). My German is not very good, but I think according to the page you linked, he got temporary blindness from the mustard gas (not disputed) and <i>then</i> may have been a victim of hysterical blindness in addition to that, after he got admitted to the hospital.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>On October 15, 1918, shortly before the end of war, Hitler was admitted to a field hospital, temporarily blind following a poison gas attack. Recent research by Bernhard Horstmann however indicates the blindness may have been the result of an hysterical reaction to Germany's military defeat.</i></dd>

<dd>The text to the book says, the mustard gas attacked his eyes, but doesn't say he became blind thereafter. It says, he was treated in a hospital and then treated for hysterical blindness after the German capitulation. I don't know, whether the source (i.e. the book) is trustworthy, but the publishing house is well-established and has a good name, so I guess the book has to be taken seriously. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMale1979_76fc.html" title="User:Male1979">Ben</a> <a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMale1979_96ca.html" title="User talk:Male1979">talk</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Male1979_fd02.html" title="Special:Contributions/Male1979">contr</a> 08:35, May 13, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Sure, you can identify all other groups within the article, but not in the lead section. The point of the lead section is to summarize, not explain every single detail. The groups that were affected the most are those that should be in the lead section. You can say "Jews, Slavs, and other groups" instead.
<ul>
<li>But the handicapped and the political opponents (etc.) WERE among the groups that were affected the most. They, too, were nearly obliterated. (The Slavs, by the way, were NOT.) Moreover, the fact that he tried to extinguish all handicapped and homosexuals gives the reader information about Hitler's mind that is every bit as interesting/valuable as the fact that he tried to extinguish Jews. Finally, please note that when you list some, but not all categories of victims, you are not summarizing. You are being <i>selective</i>. <i>Summarizing</i> would be "Hitler tried to extinguish many different groups of people."
<ul>
<li>The Jews are the most oft-mentioned, and most drastically affected, group in connection with the Holocaust. You can't leave them out. Saying "Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals, and other groups" or even "about six million Jews and five million others" would work.
<ul>
<li>By what measure do you say that the Jews were the "most drastically affected"? I'll bet the percentage of handicapped and political opponents that were killed is higher than the percentage of Jews that were killed. But I can live with "about six million Jews and five million others" for now.
<ul>
<li>Total numbers are what matter for most people, not percentages. If you want a percentage: one group (the Jews) suffered 20% more deaths than all other groups combined. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><font color="#000000">brian0918</font></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#000000">™</font></a> 11:28, 1 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>As far as I am aware, the 11 million number is totally dubious. Supposedly, Simon Wiesenthal basically made it up so that the number of non-Jews killed would be nearly the number of Jews, but not quite. If you count the total number of people killed by the Nazis who weren't actually soldiers under arms, it's far more than 11 million. If you only consider those killed in a similar way to how the Jews were killed, it's considerably less. We shouldn't repeat that number unless we have a serious source for it. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 05:36, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"He was never promoted beyond corporal because he wasn't a German citizen."</span></h2>
<p>The current version of the article says: "He was never promoted beyond corporal because he wasn't a German citizen."</p>
<p>Another thing that doesn't sound right. In <i>Hubris</i> Kershaw writes (p.91):</p>
<dl>
<dd>On 3 November 1914, (with effect from 1 November), Hitler was promoted to corporal. It was his last promotion of the war, though he could certainly have been expected to advance further, at least as far as non-commissioned offizier (<i>Unteroffizier</i>). Later in the war, he was in fact nominated by Max Amman, then a staff sergeant, subsequently Hitler's press baron, and the regimental staff considered making him <i>Unteroffizier</i> [1]. Fritz Wiedermann, the regimental regimental adjutant who in the 1930s became for a time one of the Führer's adjutants, testified after the end of the Third Reich that Hitler's superiors had thought him lacking in leadership qualities. [2]. However, both Amann and Wiedermann made clear that Hitler, probably because he would have been transferred from the regimental staff, actually refused to be considered for promotion. [3]</dd>
</dl>
<p>[1] Anton Joachimsthaler, <i>Korrektur einer Bibliographie. Adolf Hitler 1908-1920</i>, Munich, 1989., 159-60</p>

<p>[3] Joachimsthaler, 159-60</p>
<p>So it doesn't seem that his citizenship was taken into account or that it was the reason for no further promotions. What is the source for that?</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">How come such serious errors slip through in such a prominent article?</span></h3>
<p>I consider myself an experienced Wikipedian (although I do most of my work in the Hungarian version), but after seeing errors such as this being included in such a well known article my trust is seriously shaken in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>What's the excuse this time? (My excuses to critics are usually, "yes but this can't happen in better known topics" or "yes, you're right something stupid was included, but this can't happen in EnWiki, since they have a lot of editors").</p>
<p>If it's because of a specific policy, than let's change that policy! (E.g. if a page sees more than x vandalisms a months, it should be protected, since important changes that need to be reviewed get lost in the "noise" generated by vandals and the reverts. I think x &gt; 100 for this article.)</p>
<p>Or is it a technical shortcoming in the Wikipedia software? Then let's fix it. I believe built in support for something like <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check_47bc.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Fact and Reference Check">Wikipedia:WikiProject Fact and Reference Check</a> would help. What do you think?</p>
<p>Or is it business as usual and I should get used to it? There is no way Wikipedia can get more reliable than this?</p>

<dd>Well, the excuse is fairly simple: Wikipedia is finite. No matter how well-known an article is or how many people watch it, even the most prominent articles will contain errors every now and then. This is business as usual, yes, and the only policy to blame is that Wikipedia is a wiki—though blaming that doesn't really make sense, because this article wouldn't exist in the first place if Wikipedia were not. Of course something like this wouldn't happen in, say, Britannica... <a href="../../../e/r/r/Wikipedia%7EErrors_in_the_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_that_have_been_corrected_in_Wikipedia_5d26.html" title="Wikipedia:Errors in the Encyclopædia Britannica that have been corrected in Wikipedia">or would it</a>? The difference is, of course, that <i>we</i> needn't tear our hair out over the terrible mistakes so committed, because we can just fix them.</dd>
<dd>Can Wikipedia get more reliable? Probably. How? I have no idea. People have suggested a lot; the most common suggestions are a rating system for specific revisions and/or an "approved" version that is updated with edits from "draft" as they are deemed reliable. If you are bent on fixing these problems <i>once and for all</i>, though, you're probably going to do more harm than good, because it can't be done. Even brilliant editors with good sources can slip up, undetected by the careful scrutiny of others. Is there still lots of room for improvement in Wikipedia's reliability? Sure. Is this due to some obvious deficiency we can simply fix? I daresay not. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 15:28, 2005 May 3 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your answer. I'm a software guy, I'm used to having bugs in everything I use or write. One of the things that we, software people try to do is making sure, that once a bug is fixed, it won't show up again. What will prevent this same mistake being re-added say 6 months from now and staying there for a year?</dd>
<dd>I agree that we can't fix Wikipedia "once and for all". Just like you can't write bug-free software. But there are ways to <i>improve</i> the reliability. Maybe my time as a software developer would be better spent adding features to Mediawiki than reviewing articles. This "draft" and "approved" version seems like a good idea. I can see that combined with <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check_47bc.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Fact and Reference Check">new referencing features</a> it can be a boost to reliability. Can you point me to a page where it is being discussed?</dd>

<dd>Hard... these ideas crop up everywhere but they can't seem to stay in one place. There's <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_1.0" class="extiw" title="m:Wikipedia_1.0">Wikipedia 1.0</a>, which aims to produce a half-decent print/CD-ROM version.

<dd>And while I'm on the subject, though there's no editorial equivalent of the <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regression_testing.html" title="Regression testing">regression testing</a> you mention, in practice this does happen after getting burned enough times. If a particular misgiving about an article is so common as to need debunking multiple times, then either the article will be clearly updated to <i>deny</i> the error, or if not notable or common enough, will be added to the talk page. Since this sort of thing can't be automated, unlike with software, it's naturally harder. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 16:05, 2005 May 3 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, if this article was thoroughly referenced like the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> article, I think that would help. Also I feel that the constant struggle against vandals and fanatics generates a lot of noise which makes it hard to keep track of what really changed. I believe that this article can serve as a case study for pointing out several shortcomings of Wikipedia. Anyway, thanks for the links, I'll keep thinking about this. I feel that the software can be improved to address some of the problems and help save editor's valuable time. <a href="../../../n/y/e/User%7ENyenyec_b0aa.html" title="User:Nyenyec">nyenyec</a>&#160;<a href="../../../n/y/e/User_talk%7ENyenyec_f6d7.html" title="User talk:Nyenyec">☎</a> 18:25, 4 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I hate to say it, because it's almost Wikipedia blasphemy, but if we ever want to get to the point where Wikipedia's information is to be really trusted, we have to have some system where there are restrictions on who can edit. My own view is that we should move towards a system where certain articles should be marked as 'trusted' or some such, and that after that only a list of 'trusted' editors can change them. It would be nice if we could then have an 'additional information' section which would still be visible, and which anyone could edit where people could add new facts. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 13:24, 6 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Extreme noise generated by vandalism</span></h2>
<p>Am I the only one who feels that there is so much noise generated by vandals and editors reverting vandals that it's nearly impossible to keep track of what's going on in the page history, especially when one leaves for a couple of days?</p>
<p>Would you agree, that a switch "Hide vandalism" (similar to hide minor edits in Recent changes) would help? Editors could mark vandalism reverts with a flag, so you can filter out these changes in the page history.</p>
<p>(Otherwise I'd simply protect pages like this that receive too much vandalism.)</p>

<p><a name=".22Reportedly_by_suicide.22..."></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Reportedly by suicide"...</span></h2>
<p>Right now the intro part about his death reads:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Although he wanted his reich to last a thousand years, it ended shortly after his death, reportedly by suicide, in his Berlin Führerbunker. (See Hitler's death.)</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I find this "reportedly by suicide" strange looking. What else did he die of in the Führerbunker, if not suicide? I've read many obscure theories about Hitler's death, but him being killed by someone else in the Führerbunker is not one of them. So I'd like to change that line to something like:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Although he wanted his reich to last a thousand years, it ended shortly after his suicide in the Berlin Führerbunker. (See Hitler's death.)</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Or some variant thereof. Maybe wikilink "his suicide" to <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler%27s_death.html" title="Hitler's death">Hitler's death</a>, and save some precious intro-space. But that "reportedly by suicide" thing is just silly. No? <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShanes_8450.html" title="User:Shanes">Shanes</a> 01:02, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Maybe wikilink "his suicide" to <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler%27s_death.html" title="Hitler's death">Hitler's death</a>, and save some precious intro-space</i>. Do we have to? I changed this, and while I will readily admit it's clunky, it's still better than producing easter egg links. See <a href="../../../p/i/p/Wikipedia%7EPiped_link_ad60.html" title="Wikipedia:Piped link">Wikipedia:Piped link</a>. In this case it's not <i>quite</i> so bad because it's obvious "his suicide" must link to some specific article on Hitler's death, but still. (Oh, and yeah, "reportedly" is needlessly POV.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 01:52, 2005 May 9 (UTC)

<dd>Well, this is the intro and we want to keep it short. There are many places where we could have inserted a "see also" (invasions of Czechoslovakia, see also: <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munich_Agreement_c71b.html" title="Munich Agreement">Munich Agreement</a>, Poland (see also <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish_September_Campaign_01ad.html" title="Polish September Campaign">Polish September Campaign</a>) to name a few), but we generally don't do it in intros. At least it's my impression that we shouldn't do it. The reader knows that he'll have to read the article to learn more about stuff written in the intro, and putting in "see also" stuff there seems wrong to me. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShanes_8450.html" title="User:Shanes">Shanes</a> 02:20, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>I fundamentally disagree, have any of you read <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitlers_death.html" title="Hitlers death">hitlers death</a>? The circumstances couldn't be any less clear. <big><i><b><a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a></b></i></big> 01:54, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Couldn't be any less clear" is stretching it... I know that some still think there are room for doubt wether he maybe managed to escape, but as long as we don't want to mention that in the intro (which is right IMO, a link to the death-article is enough) and we are speaking about him dying in the bunker, I feel that "reportedly" is needless NPOV. Or are there any sourses documenting that Eva Braun or any others might have shot Hitler <i>while he was still alive</i>? Not even the Hitler's death article mentions that as a theory. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShanes_8450.html" title="User:Shanes">Shanes</a> 02:20, 9 May 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Or maybe the "reportedly" is there to let there be room for the escape theory? In that case we should remove the "," after suicide. But I don't like that either. If this is the theory you have in mind with that word, that is. Is it? <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShanes_8450.html" title="User:Shanes">Shanes</a> 02:40, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Meh. It's not as bad as "allegedly", I suppose. Do we really need to go over this in the intro, though? The "defeat and death" section is there for a reason. I think we can afford to not give the minority POVs (and they are a small minority) a spotlight in the first paragraph. "Reportedly"... I dunno. Still iffy.<a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 02:32, 2005 May 9 (UTC)</dd>
