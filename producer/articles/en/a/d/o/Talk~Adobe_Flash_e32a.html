<p>Actually I was originally going to support consolidating, but since Futuresplash started out as a competing technology, and has it's own history (albeit short), I think it should have a freestanding article. <a href="../../../x/t/r/User%7EXtramental_c23a.html" title="User:Xtramental">x</a> 20:02, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I didn't say it was competing with Flash; and I'm not clear what your point is. What I'm saying is that Futurewave and Futuresplash had a unique presence before Macromedia got hold of them. It was more than just a name change. <a href="../../../x/t/r/User%7EXtramental_c23a.html" title="User:Xtramental">x</a> 01:38, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You said "Futuresplash started out as a competing technology", and since the topic of the article is Flash - I assumed you are talking about competing with Flash.</dd>
<dd>In any case, Futuresplash plug-in wasn't particularly popular until Macromedia bought it, so I don't think it deserves separate article. At most it should have a section in the current article. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuturix_f1b9.html" title="User:Futurix">Futurix</a> 08:33, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Interesting using popularity as a criterion. And yeah I was using the term "competing technology" in a wider context, sorry about the confusion. <a href="../../../x/t/r/User%7EXtramental_c23a.html" title="User:Xtramental">x</a> 14:55, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>What is this prank flash, I haven't made any flashes. Right now im working on a flash and cant find any of the action script I want so i can make a pre-loader. I need one bad.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/o/Talk%7EAdobe_Flash_e32a.html" title="Edit section: needs updating">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">needs updating</span></h2>
<p>There is a lot of info missing from this page, particularly new advancements that have happened in the last couple of years. ActionScript has matured into an object oriented language,(AS2.0) supporting many of the constructs that go with that, such as classes and interfaces. Not much here applies to versions later than Flash 4 (now at Flash 8).</p>

<p>It seems like the article's structure (and, to a lesser extent, the text itself) isn't very well balanced. The advantages section (which isn't actually a section) reads like a fairly well organized presentation, whereas the disadvantages section seems a good deal more haphazard and looks like everyone with something foul to say has just added it to the end of the list. Gripes about inconsistent scroll bars and buttons aren't balanced with a note that this sort of thing is even possible in the first place. The security points are misorganized and don't have any clear focus.</p>
<p>Can someone who is more familiar with the format take a look into this? I'll look again in a week or two, but I'd really rather someone who actually works with Flash make these changes. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilkmandan_1e7a.html" title="User:Milkmandan">Milkmandan</a> 21:18, 2005 Feb 13 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hm... I'm not entirely sure most Flash authors actually pay attention to the disadvantages of the format. 146.186.145.37 14:53, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To be honest, I think most (real) Flash developers would be kind of afraid to mess with the disadvantages list (combining topics and stuff), in fear of looking biased through the eyes of the 'flash==evil' crowd. I'll have a look at it though and provide a few links to add more information to that. <a href="../../../z/e/h/User%7EZeh_5abb.html" title="User:Zeh">Zeh</a> 14:54, 11 Apr 2005 (GMT -3)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Okey, I've changed a lot of that advantages/disadvantages section. Rewrote many of the comments, added some, split some, merged some. I believe it's a bit more neutral now (on both accounts), although I think it's too big and it's getting a bit lost. --<a href="../../../z/e/h/User%7EZeh_5abb.html" title="User:Zeh">Zeh</a></dd>

<dd>As the article stands today, it still reads to me like a sales presentation. Where are the dissenting voices? Most people I know who despise Flash don't hate it because of a few minor security flaws, patched long ago. They hate it because the whole premise is "<b>wrong</b>", for the same reason they detest Web sites that do <a href="../../../b/r/o/Browser_sniffing.html" title="Browser sniffing">browser sniffing</a> and shunt all non-"Mozilla" browsers to an error page. <a href="../../../1/2/1/User%7E121a0012.html" title="User:121a0012">121a0012</a> 02:30, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The current "Security" section looks really, really biased. I don't know anything about the subject, but the language is definitely slanted and the use of allcaps emphasis is pretty over-the-top. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshf_2e3c.html" title="User:Joshf">Joshf</a> 11:11, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Like most new technologies that are easy to learn, Flash has often been misused in a way that lacks customer focus. Flash, particularly in its early days was used to create unusable and inaccessible sites. In recent years the Flash usage has matured and the quality is much higher"</p>
<p>I agree with this statement, but there is no data to back it up and saying that "the quality is much higher" seems very... pointy.</p>
<p>Also:</p>
<p>"These factors make Flash-based content unsuitable for indexing by search engines. However, this problem can be alleviated with correct web site design."</p>
<p>This is also true. Nintendo, for instance, is heavily misusing Flash to create things as simplistic as static image links (simple HTML) which are unuseable if Flash is unavailable and can only be clicked in one way resulting in only a single action (Left click, changes the page in the current window).</p>

<p>Flash is definitely having an impact on the web. Designers are using it in very elegant and also very horrendous ways. I've just run across a site <a href="http://www.stockflash.com" class="external text" title="http://www.stockflash.com" rel="nofollow">www.stockflash.com</a> that offers really slick animations and flash templates. There's also another site called Bigshotmedia (not sure of the URL) that offers similar but much more expensive clips. Seems like you don't have to design a flash site from the ground up anymore. Hopefully with resources like this the web will become a much better place.</p>

<p>Realize that there is a difference in this plug in - it is not a visual IDE like Adobe's FlexBuilder. Having such a tool is huge advantage from the process design-development point of view, especially in Enterprise situations. Having to code visuals in text is just a time hog, not to mention that if you're making such a leap from page-based technologies you don't want to have to keep to old "throw it over the wall" processes (give static designs to developers to translate). Without a visual IDE, lots and lots of tweaking must be done sitting "side by side" with a developer - quite inefficient. Additionally, User Experience teams should be able to "own" and edit the look and feel - which requires a better separation of the functional and presentation layer that a visual IDE helps with. -Uigrrl 19:48, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

Perhaps to counter-balance this pro we could also mention that this might not actually measure the number of people that <i>want</i> flash. There seems to be a demand for flash blockers and several plugins are available to restore control back into the hands of the end-user. A useful example link would be <a href="http://flashblock.mozdev.org/" class="external free" title="http://flashblock.mozdev.org/" rel="nofollow">http://flashblock.mozdev.org/</a> for the popular mozilla firefox browser .</p>

<dd>Right, I added mention of blocking tools and FlashBlock under "Influence"</dd>

<p>Probably the biggest reason that Flash <i>is</i> the most popular browser plugin out there is because of the little vendetta between Microsoft and Sun regarding inclusion of Java Runtimes with stock Windows installs. --Allaryin 15:42, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Maybe we should delete the section "Major Studios". It doesn't seem terribly useful, especially since there aren't any criteria defining "major".

<dd>I agree that probably the main use of listing them here is advertising by giving them a higher Google rank. As R1 says the open question is what the criteria to include them are at all. A criteria could be that they have a well populated download section with free templates, configurable flash movies or design instructions. That would justify the inclusion here.

<p>I reverted recent edits - sorry for the anonymous user for this - but I decided that the content was very biased and irrelevant. Most notably, the entire Security section was about Shared Objects, sandbox violation and the text was edited to give impression that the theoretical security holes in some previous version have caused actual problems. And so on. I do agree that privacy problems exist with Flash Player, and now they are mentioned with some proportianality.

<p>What do you call a flash interactive animation? Is there an industry-standard noun used to describe such a thing? I know "website" doesn't fit, since it wouldn't neccessarily have to be online. "Flash animation" and "multimedia installation" seem too wordy, and "flash piece" is too general. "Animation" by itself isn't intereactive enough, so is there a word already existing? --<a href="../../../m/u/c/User%7EMuckapedia_b21b.html" title="User:Muckapedia">Muckapedia</a> 12h05, 19 Mar 2006</p>

<p>Perhaps correct name for the format is "Shockwave Flash". Macromedia Flash is the name of of the program used to create Flash movies, but maybe the format itself is "Schockwave Flash". While that name is confusing, and Macromedia has stated that it is incorrect and is the result of confusing two of their products, the fact is that it was Macromedia who first called it that. In fact to this day some of the URI's on Macromedia website still refer to it by that name. Also some of the pages on the macromedia website refer to it as that.</p>
<p>Note that there are lots of references to "Shockwave flash", even inside the players themselves, but it may never have been truely official. (Even with the MIME type application/x-shockwave-flash)</p>

<p>The entry for the release of Flash Player 9 seems to be misplaced, as there is now an article specifically for the player (vs authoring tool) on Wikipedia. Also, the claims that v9 is buggy aren't really substantiated in this article or entry: "unlike past versions of Flash, it is buggy and unstable, leading to frequent browser crashes on various platforms. It is also a less seamless upgrade than previous versions, and is not fully backwards-compatible."</p>
<p>While we did experience extremely high server loads that decreased our QoS in delivering the install during the MySpace upgrades, we have not yet seen a high volume of customer reports or bugs filed that indicate to us that v9 itself is "buggy and unstable." Of course, that's not to say it isn't true so I encourage users and developers to report these problems to Adobe. Also, if developers are finding areas that they feel are causing the player to not be backwards-compatible we would like to understand these issues. We are always extremely careful to protect backwards compatibility whenever possible, but it could be that we did not make clear changes or updates that were necessary for our security model OR it could be a bug that we need to address.</p>
<p>Any details and repro steps will help us track these issues down and resolve them asap. Bugs and issues should be reported here: www.adobe.com/go/wish.</p>
<p>I won't correct this entry myself since I don't have an account and don't want the action to be misinterpreted. I hope that the community will see fit to edit this to be more neutral, as it typically does.&#160;;-)</p>

<dd>As software naming conventions go, I suspect the product will be changed to <b>Adobe Flash</b> within the major release or so. Changing a product name requires a lot of work (all the documentation has to be checked and changed, coding needs to change, error messages need to change, internal catalog has to change, etc. etc. ad nauseum). I don't know what their release cycles are like but I wouldn't be surprised to see the name change for Flash (and other products like Dreamweaver) getting the <b>Adobe</b> label within a year or so.

<p>The article says that the Flash 9 IDE will be released May-June 2007. Are there any sources for this date?<br />
<br />
Updated question: Now the article says that the Flash 9 Authoring tool will be released in April 2007. Please provide a source for this critically important information. Developers with active projects have to make decisions about which version develop with based on the projected release date. An incorrect date could cause serious issues for some developers that take that date to be accurate. Thanks.<br />

<dd>Agreed. I added a citation needed tag to it. But not being a real Wikipedia contributor, I'm not sure whether that's the right course of action or not.</dd>

<p>Wondering if there's any initiative underway to integrate BitTorrent distribution into Flash, eg for BitTorrent to be used to loadMovies called for from within SWFs. Doesn't seem to be, but figured I'd post a wonder here just in case. -:)<a href="../../../o/z/z/User%7EOzzyslovechild_ce2d.html" title="User:Ozzyslovechild">Ozzyslovechild</a> 05:47, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
