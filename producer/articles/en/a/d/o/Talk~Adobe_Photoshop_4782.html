<p>Omission/flaw regarding Photoshop's development--</p>
<p>There's a problem, and it's exacerbated by the Photoshop/Adobe Photoshop name issue.</p>
<p>Adobe did not create Photoshop. It bought an existing product called "Barneyscan XP" that had already been commercially distributed, which it renamed, continued to develop, and published as "Photoshop".</p>
<p>This means the release history is faulty. It omits the first commercial distribution of Photoshop, which was bundled with a scanner before Adobe had any involvement.</p>
<p>Refer to this page for further information: <a href="http://www.storyphoto.com/multimedia/multimedia_photoshop.html" class="external free" title="http://www.storyphoto.com/multimedia/multimedia_photoshop.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.storyphoto.com/multimedia/multimedia_photoshop.html</a></p>
<p>Search for "Barneyscan XP" to see corroboration of that point.</p>

<p>I changed the page name from Photoshop to include Adobe as our usual practice is to refer to such products by their proper name rather than their colloqiual name (c.f. <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft_PowerPoint_79bb.html" title="Microsoft PowerPoint">Powerpoint</a>, <a href="../../../e/x/c/Excel.html" title="Excel">Excel</a> etc). I don't think this is a big deal but thought I should leave a talk page note explaining my rationale as the page has had a long history at the old name. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pete/Pcb21</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">(talk)</a> 08:34, 27 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
The full name of this product is Adobe Photoshop CS and perhaps that should be the name of this page as well to disambiguate it from Adobe Photoshop Elements.</p>
<dl>
<dd>CS is the current version, but this article discusses versions from before the existence of CS and Elements as well. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 10:03, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It seems that the majority of people favouring GIMP do so beacuse it is open source, not because it is a particularly good product. I don't know much about GIMP myself, given that I'm quite happy with Photoshop, but it would be interesting to read any comments that cared to shed light on the two programs head-to-head.</p>

<p>According to the official Wikipedia policy of <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">What Wikipedia is not</a>, that it is not a "mirror or a repository of links, images, or media files." The reason why is that "excessive lists can dwarf articles and detract from the purpose of Wikipedia." As of July 13th, the Adobe Photoshop article has way too many external links that I think are distracting to the general purpose informing visitors why the program is notable. Do we need all those Photoshop tutorial links? I don't think so. Most of those websites are just redudant information like using a polygon lasso. --<a href="../../../k/r/y/User%7EKrystyn_Dominik_fe63.html" title="User:Krystyn Dominik">Krystyn Dominik</a> 17:07, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agreed. Problem is, cleaning out the list and keeping it short is quite a bit of work. Figuring out what is a good link is a non-trivial task. It has been done for <a href="../../../h/t/m/HTML_4c4a.html" title="HTML">HTML</a>, for example, but the list there was much shorter to begin with. <a href="../../../r/l/_/User%7ERl_43ae.html" title="User:Rl">Rl</a> 18:25, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've made a first pass through removing things that didn't look appropriate. The items I've removed are below, for easy restoration if anyone is able to make a convincing argument for including them. I've probably been a bit arbitrary where choosing between similar sites, but the primary criteria I've <i>tried</i> to consider are:</dd>
<dd>1. How many sites we already have listed with similar content</dd>
<dd>2. The content-to-advertising ratio</dd>
<dd>3. Whether the link is a duplicate - we only need ONE link to photoshopsupport.com at most, not three or four!</dd>
<dd>4. And, of course, several of the links were broken or dead anyway.</dd>
<dd>In practice, this disqualifies most of the links that were there; what's left seems to me to be an appropriately representative sample.</dd>
<dd>I guess some of my decisions may be controversial - if you disagree with sites I've removed, please restore individual links rather than doing a wholesale revert! Think of this as a first attempt to tidy things up: I'm not trying to present this as a definitive list of what should stay and what should go, just trying to get things moving on keeping the list under control. Disagree, discuss, change things back, whatever. Just remember that our common goal here is to write an encyclopedia, not to make a list of all the best Photoshop sites on the web, so please try to think in terms of what's notable, not just what's your favourite! <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> 13:27, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've cut the following sentence: <i>Photoshop CS features a revolutionary command : 'Shadow/Highlight' which allow user to 'suppress' highlights and/or 'push out' shadows while maintaining most of the 'image details' (that is, the histogram would remain virtually unchanged).</i> The language sounds like it was lifted straight from an Adobe press release, and at the end of the sentence I still don't have a clue what the feature in question is supposed to do. If this is really a notable feature, maybe someone could describe it in a way that makes sense, and explain how it differs from equivalent features in other programs. <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> 12:46, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I remember reading of a program / PS filter which did this (was used to enhance macroscopic imagery) and it retailed for... 1000$? It was described with a really long name, which when I googled on it actually turned up science articles. {sj?ar}</dd>

<p>I'd insinuate that the cheaper version ("Elements") was created to compete with the low price of <a href="../../../p/a/i/Paint_Shop_Pro_54dd.html" title="Paint Shop Pro">PSP</a>, and then the fact that PSP has all features without paying for it (how much of <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shareware.html" title="Shareware">shareware</a> apps works, before it was "register within 30 days or else!" and a <a href="../../../n/a/g/Nag_screen.html" title="Nag screen">nag screen</a>, lately [~2002] apps stop working after the trial period [using novel methods disabling usage even if unistalling/re-installing it], after twice the time, degradation of features [after time], etc) - the PS demo doesn't have a save feature for one, kinda "major". As for the "well you know, everyone warez'd PS" argument - firstly not everyone wants the super program (see: <a href="../../../m/a/y/Maya.html" title="Maya">Maya</a> vs <a href="../../../p/o/v/Povray.html" title="Povray">Povray</a> vs <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renderman.html" title="Renderman">Renderman</a> vs <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quake.html" title="Quake">Quake</a> [aka <a href="../../../r/e/a/Realtime.html" title="Realtime">realtime</a> renderers]), which doesn't just have to do with being a "good citizen", since PSP isn't as advanced and featured filled it also loads faster and works better on older computers. (The exact reason professional 3d-rendering companies have been known to use earlier versions). My main impression of PSP is that it's very robust and responsive, while the interface is clunky, I also don't have good memories of the filters, although it had support for PS filters early. Also a note is that the later PS versions were heavily influenced by <a href="../../../p/a/i/Painter.html" title="Painter">Painter</a> - the brush features have gotten very extensive.

I'm fine with the information it provides, but it needs to sound a lot less like an advertisement of Photoshop"</i>, and finally moved here by me:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Photoshop provides the power to edit and create bitmap graphics. Whether it be fixing colors and small problems with photos, or creating individual artwork by editing and fusing pictures together, a skilled user can do anything that is desired on a bitmap with this program. Through the use of separate layers, the user can edit parts of the project separately from one another. Users can make graphics appear 3D on its 2D canvas. Areas on the picture can be covered up to make it seem nothing was there using the surrounding pixels. Colors can be changed using RGB colors, editing the hue, saturation, and brightness, or changing the levels. Any part of the project can be selected using many different tools, and then moved to another area or project, or edited without affecting the area around it. Pixels of any graphic can be blurred, sharpened, smudged, moved, reduced, added, copied, erased, warped, have changed color, etc. Photoshop has some features that only require a few clicks of the mouse to greatly edit pictures. It can do auto levels, contrast, and color. It can do filters that artistically alter the pictures. There are endless possibilities with this program as far as 2D images go.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm not sure this actually says anything beyond "Photoshop is a bitmap graphics editor", since all these comments apply to all reasonably sophisticated editors, so I don't think it belongs in "Features".</p>
<p>It could be argued that the article does need a better introduction that explains what a bitmap editor does, though; the present text wouldn't make it clear to someone who didn't know, and none of the links lead directly to an explanation. And since Photoshop <i>is</i> the most famous example, it's a likely first point of call for new readers with an interest in this topic. So a suitably NPOV version of the above would be a good place to start, if anyone feels inspired. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 13:43, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>History</li>
<li>Layers</li>
<li>Channels</li>
<li>Filters</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Point is, the current article yields no clue as to what can be done with Photoshop. Granted, some of the features are in more, or most, graphics editors but not in all.

<p>Yeah, that's why I added the paragraph; the article as is said nothing of what Photoshop does other that "manipulates bitmaps." Of course my paragraph would need rewording since I'm not very good at that kind of thing. I was just trying actually include Photoshop's features in the "Features" section.

I thought it was already available and will re-send my email to them. I agree with rm of see also link here until it's released. I, for one, look forward to being able to trace by drawing instead of fiddling with tangent control points, and I can't imagine anyone who doesn't. I'm kind of sad that the natural medium between pixel-based tracing and current Adobe tracing splines is subject to patent protection. If it weren't, it would probably already be in there.

<dd>Where such things are unique to Photoshop, yes, they should certainly be described here. The only problem is that most people only ever learn one package, so there aren't that many people who will easily be able to identify which aspects of Photoshop's brush tools, say, are unique and should be written about <i>here</i>, and which are standard features that should be described in a general article like <a href="../../../b/i/t/Bitmap_graphics_editor.html" title="Bitmap graphics editor">Bitmap graphics editor</a>. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 23:31, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What about more detailed descriptions of functionality, like what an adjustment layer is, what it can do, how to superimpose layers in different ways, etc.? Has that been discussed and a decision was taken not to add it to avoid making Wikipedia a user manual, or has simply no one bothered writing it yet? I would like to see more about what calculations are behind "multiply" for example, and what kind of effects it gives.

<dd>These things would certainly be appropriate to discuss on Wikipedia: they are important aspects of modern graphic design. However, you are quite right that we want to avoid having user-manual-like material here. The way to avoid that is to discuss features that exist in many programs in general terms, rather than explaining how to use the specific implementations in Photoshop.</dd>
<dd>For example, the "multiply" operation you mention is a standard image processing operation that is provided by many other bitmap graphics editors as well as Photoshop. As such, it should definitely be explained, but not here -- it should either have an article of its own, or go in an article on image arithmetic in general (I'm actually a bit surprised that image arithmetic doesn't seem to exist yet.

<p>The rest of the article fails to cite any sources and is flagged for not doing so. I think we should clean up the rest of the article as well, instead of changing what you think is a poor addtion.</p>
<p>Google has 1,450,000 search results for "photoshop airbrush". What do you mean Photoshop is not known for the airbrush tool? There is also the slang of "photoshopped", and when used to referred to a model, it means to use the Airbrush tool to "clean them up".</p>
<dl>
<dd>Google also has 1,450,000 search results for "photoshop elephant". Shall we add a paragraph claiming that Photoshop is known for its use in editing pictures of elephants? I can find no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> that suggest that the airbrush tool is a particular feature that people think of in the context of Photoshop, or even that Photoshop's airbrush tool is particularly different from the airbrush tools in any of its competitors.</dd>
<dd>Additionally, the fact that the rest of the article also lacks sources does not justify the addition of another section that is no better. The Playboy claim is unverifiable, and thus it fails Wikipedia's fundamental <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability policy</a>, and thus we are forbidden to include it. This would naturally cease to be a problem if you were able to provide a reliable source for the claim, so that readers can verify that it is true. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 21:34, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are other tools that also have airbrushes, so it is hardly anything associated with Photoshop in particular. The slang term "photoshopped" is hardly limited to modifications using the airbrush. If I apply curves to increase contrast in an image, I may very well say I photoshopped it. Personally, I use Photoshop regularly, but I don't think I have used the airbrush for several years. <a href="../../../m/l/e/User%7EMlewan_ca7e.html" title="User:Mlewan">Mlewan</a> 06:00, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good catch. According to the only source I can find (Jeff Schewe's article <i>10 Years of Photoshop</i>, in PEI magazine, February 2000, available online from <a href="http://www.schewephoto.com/pei/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.schewephoto.com/pei/index.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>), the original impetus for developing Photoshop was actually digital special effects for movies, though it was a scanner company that first distributed Photoshop commercially (version 0.87, not version 1.00) -- so not only was this claim unverifiable, it also appears to have been incorrect. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 23:31, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dt>Please verify</dt>
<dd>This needs to be verified. I believe that both statements are correct but I am not sure where to find a source of this.

<p>This article seems have a little bit of these elements: worded in glowing terms, only says good things about Photoshop, keeps on saying that it is the best. It should be worded a little more critically, I think. There are also lost of unreferenced, boastful claims in the article, such as "it is considered the industry standard". I only put in one { fact } tag in (I didn't put in a pov or needs citation tag on the entire article, even though one probably should be there), but the article really needs to be fixed. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlthepal_2d33.html" title="User:Althepal">Althepal</a> 00:43, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not sure how people would set this up in the Wikipedia article, but it is confirmed that Adobe is planning two versions of CS3. "Photoshop CS3" and "Photoshop CS3 Extented". "Photoshop CS3" will feature all the basic and normal content, while "Photoshop CS3 Extented" will house several extra features. This version is aimed towards users that works with film, TV and multimedia, in spesific 3D and movements. Not much else has been released at this moment, but it is said they will release futher information the 27th of March.</p>
