<p><i>Hitler’s Mein Kampf is not widely available in Germany. His legacy, as interpreted by some historians, has caused him to be one of the most denounced men in history. Other historians, however, point out that Hitler's attempt to improve the economic and political standing and conditions of his people and how he went about it, was, in essence, no different than that of many other leaders in history and thus this denouncement is hypocritical and not completely objective.</i></p>
<p>How was Hitler "no different" than leaders like Churchill or FDR? At least they didn't gas people in attempting to improve economic and political standing.

<dd>I just saw Andries edit. As far as how many people worship Hitler as a deity, or view him as an Avatar of Vishnu, I am concerned about the possibility of verifying that. I know that the concept has been involved with both Hindu nationalism (a huge movement in India), with South american politics, and of course with <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_metal.html" title="Black metal">Black metal</a>, and <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-nazi.html" title="Neo-nazi">neo-nazi</a> <a href="../../../%C3%A1/s/a/%C3%81satr%C3%BA.html" title="Ásatrú">Ásatrú</a> scene.

<p>I did read the links. There's not really much there about Hitler being 'worshipped as a deity'. Just a reference to one guy, Devi, viewing him as an Avatar of Vishnu. You also say that you are concerned about the possibility of verifying it. In that case, it shouldn't be said. I also think this whole thing seems unconnected with Hitler, the man. And that's what this article's about. The page <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_mysticism.html" title="Nazi mysticism">Nazi mysticism</a> links into the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazism</a> page. Those who want to read about it can find it there, where it belongs. Unless you have evidence of Hitler encouraging or supporting attempts to deify him, that comment does not belong here. (Oh, and Hitler didn't reign either, only monarchs (kings, queens, emperors, etc.) reign.) <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJongarrettuk_f336.html" title="User:Jongarrettuk">jguk</a> 14:55, 6 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../s/a/v/Savitri_Devi_1db0.html" title="Savitri Devi">Savitri Devi</a> isn't a guy, she <i>was</i> a girl, I get the impression you didn't read very thoroughly. For example, see <a href="../../../m/i/g/Miguel_Serrano_c94b.html" title="Miguel Serrano">Miguel Serrano</a>.

<p>And that's your problem, not mine. And I find you calling me buck-o offensive and ask you to be more civil towards me. There's no reason why we cannot disagree civilly. You say can't begin to quantify numbers: 1,000s, 10,000s, 100,000s, more? IMHO you'd need at least tens of thousands worshipping him as a deity to make it noteworthy enough for an article. If you can't support your assertion with verifiable evidence of its noteworthiness, the assertion needs to go until you can. I ask you to leave the article as it is - provide evidence to support your views, and if it is deemed reliable enough by the wikicommunity, your statement can go back in.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The fact that I don't have a handy link to census data on an obscure cult like this one in no way makes it any less notable that the man is worshipped by some, and that many see a link between Nazism and the occult. Since you seem disinterested in my copious references, I have requested page protection. it would be nice if you researched a bit, but I suppose I can't force you. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam</a> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow"><b>Spade</b></a>] 16:10, 6 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have added by point by point comments for each of your references (apart from the books, which I obviously can’t get at from my laptop) in bold. It is a crude way, but one that is effective in separating my comments from yours. They show that there is a very small number of people who argue that Hitler is an avatar of Vishnu. They do not quantify the number, but that number seems to be very small. Indeed, one of the articles you quoted was called ‘Nutty Nazis’. It is clear that this is a sub subtopic at the very most.</p>
<p>There is no disagreement that <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_mysticism.html" title="Nazi mysticism">Nazi mysticism</a> or <a href="../../../e/s/o/Esoteric_Hitlerism_cc70.html" title="Esoteric Hitlerism">Esoteric Hitlerism</a> exist. And it is right that Wikipedia has articles covering them. But you have so far failed to prove that a significant number of people worship Hitler as a deity for that comment to remain in this article. It is not relevant to Hitler. I will add under ‘Related articles’ <a href="../../../e/s/o/Esoteric_Hitlerism_cc70.html" title="Esoteric Hitlerism">Esoteric Hitlerism</a>. <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_mysticism.html" title="Nazi mysticism">Nazi mysticism</a> properly belongs as a link off <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazism</a> rather than Hitler, and quite rightly it is already there.</p>
<p>I have now spent quite a bit of time reading your references. Many of which had little to offer on the subject at hand. If you want to quote further references to me, I should be grateful if you would ensure they are to the point, and in particular that they offer some sort of quantification of how many people worship Hitler as a deity. Until and unless you provide evidence of quantification, please do not reinsert your statement. You have not yet proven that it is relevant enough to Hitler, the man, to have in this article. Finally, perhaps we can keep our disagreement on this talk page rather than reverting each other. I agree that if you provide evidence to prove your claim is notable (which would include some quantification of those worshipping Hitler as a deity), your comment can return. I ask you agree that until you have done so, the comment stays out. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJongarrettuk_f336.html" title="User:Jongarrettuk">jguk</a> 16:53, 6 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>Sam, did you write that unrelated remark about Nazi Mysticism in <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kalki.html" title="Kalki">Kalki</a>?? I think you are a nice guy but you have strange ideas on Nazi Mysticism and the connection between Hitler and Kalki. And by the way, I support Jongarrettuk's revert. I think it was extremely rare that Hitler was worshipped as a deity, only <a href="../../../s/a/v/Savitri_Devi_1db0.html" title="Savitri Devi">Savitri Devi</a> is a documented case. I personally have strong doubt that there ever was something as Nazi Mysticism. May be pseudo religion, and Himmler believed in the occult and had a mysticism hobby, but he was only one person. There were far more practicing Christians in the Nazi party than mystics but was not a Christian party. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 00:38, 26 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>

You keep inserting this wikilink in spite of Jongarettuk's reverts and my support of her/his revert. I would have little problem with a wikilink to a possible article Religious elements of Nazism here but real <i>Nazi Mysticism</i> is too rare and the word mysticism is too strong to be mentioned here. I agree that Nazism had aspects of a pseudo-religion (or even was a pseudo-religion) and this could be mentioned here. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 13:27, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

The sentence ‘They revere Hitler and those who fell with him in World War II as martyrs to a holy cause.’ shows that, according to the author, most Nutty Nazis revere Hitler. That is nothing like worshipping him as a deity. Other sentences include: ‘They think that if they can first persuade people of a lot of false and silly notions, they will have an easier time of persuading them, eventually, of the truth….and, by the way, Hitler was the ninth Avatar of the God Vishnu, and many non-Whites in India worshipped him as a God, so he's all right……It is hard to persuade anybody of such false and kooky beliefs.’ There is a small list of figureheads in the Chapter 5 summary, that does boost your numbers though. I can add 15 to your total, and am willing to assume that they have a few followers. But we’re still not up to the level where this is notable enough FOR THIS ARTICLE.</b></li>

<p>quote from hitler anybody??</p>
<p><a name="Complaints" id="Complaints"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Complaints</span></h2>
<p>In the first part of the article, there is no reason to say that Hitler was "reported to have committed suicide," when the suicide has been documented by many eyewitnesses and finally confirmed with the opening of the KGB files on the disposal and eventual total destruction of his remains.</p>
<p>The section on "Economics and Culture" is couched in terms that are far too positive and sympathetic. It also uses the term "civil improvement," which to American readers, at least, does not clearly denote public works projects, but sounds rather more like an improvement in society.</p>
<p>The sentence, " Hitler's health initiatives for ethnic Germans were successful and progressive," has a vaguely völkisch flavor and makes it sound as if he were a benevolent ruler; further, it is vague to the point of meaninglessness, since there is no explanation of the term "health initiatives."</p>
<p>The sentence, " Hitler's policies emphasised the importance of family life: men were the breadwinners, women’s priorities being Church, Kitchen and Children," similarly sounds as if it were written by a right-wing admirer of Kinder, Kuche, Kirche (in American terms: barefoot and pregnant) -- in other words, a blatant sexist.</p>
<p>The next sentence, "Excellence was encouraged in all spheres," may be true in some very limited sense, but I don't think Wiki should put itself in the position of making such a blandly positive statement about the greatest mass murderer of all time who in the process of "encouraging excellence" burned and banned great literature, confined German art to puerile representiveness and caused many of the country's leading artists and scientists to flee to the U.S. and other countries.</p>

<dd>practically nobody agrees about Hitlers death, except they al wanted him dead, Even stalin doubted the account. The eventual total destruction of his remains is even more eveidence that something fishy occured. Overall, I find your complaints to be of the <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> nature of the article, not something that aught to be "fixed". <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam</a> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow"><b>Spade</b></a>] 20:29, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You ought to capitalize the beginnings of your sentences. As to "nobody" agreeing about Hitler's death -- you ought to have your head examined.</p>

<p>Why are all of the pictures of him relatively sympathetic? Although it's also bias to always show him screaming at a microphone, please show both if you will.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, they're good pics. If you can find a public domain or GFDL shot of him screaming at a microphone, please supply it. Thanks! --<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolbez_ce9f.html" title="User:Golbez">Golbez</a> 02:46, Nov 18, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"<i>intimidated</i>" in describing the actions of the Centre Party,Germany is disputed and the dispute broadens to the error in claiming on its' page that the Catholic Centre Party (Zentrumspartei) was " dissolved by Hitler ".

<p>Sir John Wheeler-Bennett in <i>The Nemesis of Power-The German Army in Politics 1918-1945</i> indexes the Centre Party's <i>condonation</i> of Nazism <i>after</i> Hitler gained the Chancellorship and came therefore to power in 1933 . Wheeler-Bennett says that the Centre , whatever its mental reservations ,condoned his Government by voting for him .<a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlamekeeper_f5a0.html" title="User:Flamekeeper">Flamekeeper</a> 10:39, 27 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I came across in some writings Hitler referring to the <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_Republic_f438.html" title="November Republic">November Republic</a>. Now I assume (and am pretty confident) that this is the same as the <a href="../../../w/e/i/Weimar_Republic_9fad.html" title="Weimar Republic">Weimar Republic</a>, but I wanted to have this confirmed before I went ahead and made a redirect. I assume someone here can back me up (or correct me if I'm mistaken). I was going to write this at the Weimar talk page, but this one has tons more traffic. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 20:58, 27 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>correct. This was Hitler's derogatory term for the republic that was founded after the defeat in November that he attributed to traitors, communists and Jews. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 21:03, 27 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hitler's Death and Controversies Surrounding It</span></h2>
<p>I saw this on Unsolved Histories on Discovery Channel, it's title is Hitler in the Andes.</p>
<p>They said that the FBI had an eleven year investigation of wheter or not he died. Seeing that much of the information available that time were propaganda, wheter it was from the Allies, the Nazis, the Russian, and several other parties, do anyone here has any info or fact about this investigation?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, if Hitler's body was cremated, how can there be a Soviet autopsy that revealed that he has only one testicle? Just curious. --Vandal Unknown 19:58, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
