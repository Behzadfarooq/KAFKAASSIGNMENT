<h2><span class="mw-headline">Why so extremely negative introduction?</span></h2>
<p>Why is the introduction of Adolf Hitler now so extremely negative and mostly turned into POV statements? This is not in accordance with our <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_7fb1.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">NPOV policy</a>. In the same time, the introduction of <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Stalin_46d2.html" title="Joseph Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>, the worst mass murderer of all times, is mostly positive and deals nearly only with his economic and scientific achievements and fails to mention his crimes adequately. A complete rewrite of one of them is in order.</p>
<dl>
<dd>We've had this discussion. Unfortunately, it wasn't much good, because as you can see, the intro is back to the good old "Hitler was a bad man" style of intro, including the word "reviled", on which whole tomes were written on this talk page. "Widely regarded" makes everything better, of course. Hum.</dd>
<dd>Playing devil's advocate for a moment, I'd say it's probably impossible to write an NPOV intro on Hitler that satisfies everyone with its clear neutrality. If you don't mention how he was a bad man with some loaded term like "reviled", some people are going to cry foul for covering up this admittedly "widely regarded" view of Hitler. If you <i>do</i> mention it, others are going to cry foul over such a deliberate POV angle, accurate or not. Who is right? Since the intro can't really be used for citations, and is supposed to be a summary of the whole article, there's really far too wide a battleground. Polls, perhaps? Eternal back-and-forth edits? Wait for someone with the Right Version we just haven't thought about yet to come around? I don't know.</dd>
<dd><i>Not</i> playing devil's advocate for a moment, but coming from my personal view, I'd say "for crying out loud, how is it helping any reader to inform them Hitler was 'widely regared' as 'reviled'?" Even if you don't know who Hitler was (humor me, here) "reviled" is too big a judgement to toss around without immediately backing it up. Yes, I know what Hitler did, and once you've gotten the little issue of genocide past the reader, there might be more understanding for the "reviled" bit. But still.</dd>
<dd>For comparison, here is how Britannica's article starts. Their conventions differ from ours (they don't really start with a concise intro of everything) but it's still instructive.</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p>byname Der Führer (German: “The Leader”)<br />
born April 20, 1889, Braunau am Inn, Austria<br />
died April 30, 1945, Berlin, Germany<br /></p>
<p>leader of the National Socialist (Nazi) Party (from 1920/21) and chancellor (Kanzler) and Führer of Germany (1933–45). He was chancellor from January 30, 1933, and, after President Paul von Hindenburg's death, assumed the twin titles of Führer and chancellor (August 2, 1934).</p>
<p>Hitler's father, Alois (born 1837), was illegitimate. For a time he bore his mother's name, Schicklgruber, but by 1876 he had established his family claim to the surname Hitler. Adolf never used any other surname.</p>

<p>I agree w both of you heartilly, and would like to see a balanced intro. We must always strive for NPOV, even if its unachievable! <big><i><b><a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a></b></i></big> 22:57, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Saying that hitler was bad man in the intro is childish, even if one uses a $20 word "reviled". The current intro pretty much says what he did, and if a reader thinks that WWII and Holocaust were not that bad, we are not going to change their mind by saying "Watch out! Hitler was nasty boy" two lines of text above. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 23:54, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I happen to agree with the evaluation of the prose, but this historical irony is so immaterial (in the sense of information delivery) IMO. There is plenty of fine reading around.

<p>Let's say a reader who has never heard of Adolf Hitler comes to Wikipedia to find out about him. As far as I'm concerned, such a person is done a disservice if we point out that Hitler was "regarded as significant" but not that he is reviled--and, folks, saying that Hitler is "reviled" (not that he's "evil," which is not what we say) is a statement of fact.</p>
<p>I'd be happy with not mentioning (until later, perhaps) how Hitler is regarded, but if we do we must mention that it is in a negative way. To do otherwise it to appear strangely ignorant of Hitler's legacy. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemi_6641.html" title="User:Demi">Demi</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/e/m/User_talk%7EDemi_ab67.html" title="User talk:Demi">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Demi_a1b0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Demi">C</a></sub> 01:11, 2005 May 11 (UTC)</p>
<p>You can't write an intro to Hitler that is remotely balanced if you omit to mention his reputation. To describe him, as was done recently, as simply "a German politician", is like describing Oliver Cromwell as a Member of Parliament for Huntingdon. We don't report our own opinion of him, but we *must* report the most widespread opinion of him. To omit that from the intro, ironically, unbalances the article when the intention is the exact opposite. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 01:20, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think my version, plus the excision of "significant", works fine. The first paragraph of the lead describes him - he was fuhrer and reichskanzler of Germany, his nation controlled most of Europe during this time, and he was head of the Nazi party. All purely factual, all purely NPOV. The second para describes his role in the start of WW2 - again, purely factual and NPOV. (except perhaps for the mention of "unprecedented scale" but come on, it was) Anyone who gets beyond the first paragraph will get to the second paragraph, which makes it very clear that he was a <b>bad man</b>. It doesn't need to be stated explicitly. At first, I was against removing either "reviled" or "significant", but as it stands now, those are implied in the writing, which is probably a better option than saying to the reader, "HEY YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO HATE THIS GUY". And yes, putting "German politican" was needlessly sanitizing it. --<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolbez_ce9f.html" title="User:Golbez">Golbez</a> 01:40, May 11, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You know what I'd like? Something more than "Since the defeat of Germany in World War II, Hitler, the Nazi Party and the results of Nazism have been regarded in much of the world as synonymous with evil. Historical and cultural portrayals of Hitler in the west are almost uniformly negative." From here to "widely reviled" is just not good enough. I know it's the proverbial elephant, but surely we can dig up some sources on how Hitler is viewed? At least we'd have something to justify those terms with. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 01:38, 2005 May 11 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's the introduction we're talking about. We *should* say he's widely reviled and that his significance in twentieth century history is regarded as great, because those are the most significant facts about Hitler--that long after his death his name is synonymous with evil, that even now it's illegal to publish his autobiography in Germany, and that he's held to blame for the conflagration of Europe. How can we possibly justify an opener that omits these facts? How could we call an article with such glaring omissions NPOV? --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 02:58, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Oh well, time to accept the consensus. I'm utterly baffled, the first two paragraphs seem to me to have lost all their former clarity and beauty (how did we end up with the tortuous "He implemented the racial policies of Nazi Germany, including what is now known as The Holocaust, the genocide of millions, including approximately 6 million Jews"? -ugh!) When despite my involvement the language quality and clarity of an article degrades, I find it's best to just give up. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 03:57, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey the style and the content of article, especially the introduction get really terrible sometimes. It's very difficult of course to have a good wording there. You can find many other attempts and a lot of discussion here. The current wording was a compromise on many others before.</dd>
<dd>I read what <a href="../../../n/y/e/User%7ENyenyec_b0aa.html" title="User:Nyenyec">nyenyec</a> considered the wikipedia-inherent limitations. There is of course a problem with vandalism and very divergent opinions about him. I guess this one here is the most controversial article on wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>One idea, to have at least the introduction stable and solid, would be to vote on the exact wording of it and then protect it. I mean not protection protection, but to put e.g. a warning there, e.g. &lt;!-- don't edit the introduction. Discuss your ideas first on the discussion page --&gt;. This way any changes could be easier reverted and vandals easily identified. We could at least arrive at a stable version of the introduction. Any thoughts on that? Is it antiwiki? <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMale1979_76fc.html" title="User:Male1979">Ben</a> <a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMale1979_96ca.html" title="User talk:Male1979">talk</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Male1979_fd02.html" title="Special:Contributions/Male1979">contr</a> 05:33, May 11, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<blockquote>

<p>Hitler's attempts to create a <a href="../../../g/r/o/Grossdeutschland.html" title="Grossdeutschland">Greater Germany</a>, beginning with the annexation of <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austria</a> and the invasions of <a href="../../../c/z/e/Czechoslovakia.html" title="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a>, were the primary cause of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> in Europe.

<p>I'm not saying it's perfect at all, but I want to point out three significant facts:</p>

<li>This intro accurately represents the most salient facts about Hitler's life and career.</li>
<li>In particular, it describes the results of his actions in piles of bodies.</li>
<li>It does not use "charismatic", "reviled", "evil" or any other adjective describing common views of Hitler, and I can't say I'm missing them.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, I'm sure some of you still think that not mentioning at least something like "reviled" violates NPOV by ignoring a common view. I disagree. The intro is not required to represent common views of Hitler <i>at all</i>. Unlike, say, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a>, historical views on Hitler's merits are not significant for establishing his notability. Oh, I'll grant you that they're significant in and of themselves, and belong in the <i>article</i>—but I do not believe we have to use the intro for them. If we decide to do this, then yes, the burden of doing it in an NPOV manner is on us, but do we really need to do this? I think not, and I think insisting on it burden us with a Mission Impossible. Trying to cram everything in the intro is an exercise that may be beyond mere mortals, when it comes to convincing everyone of its neutrality. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 13:10, 2005 May 11 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks, I was rather pleased with that; I did have a single sentence which included significant, reviled <i>and</i> evil, and it was easily removed, and it probably works better this way. I put that in there as an attempt to try it. The other edits since mine were equating the Holocaust with his policies; I'll change "eventually involving" to "culminating in". And the first graph may be improvable, but I'm not sure how at this moment. --<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolbez_ce9f.html" title="User:Golbez">Golbez</a> 16:43, May 11, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Re-reading Tony's comments, it strikes me that there is no reason we couldn't have a paragraph on Hitler's reputation and impact <i>after</i> the mere facts. This seems much better to me than mixing in these sentences in an attempt to get a wondrously clear two-paragraph magic intro. Separating concerns might have merit. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 13:17, 2005 May 11 (UTC)</p>
<p>Analogous with <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Stalin_46d2.html" title="Joseph Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>, there should be someting about the positive sides of his rule, like the economical achivements that pulled Germany out of the depression of the 20s, and technological achievements, as well as lasting things like the social welfare state (and perhaps things like the Autobahn, Volkswagen etc.). Only including negative things in the introduction is POV. Also, Hitler was NOT responsible for all 30 million deaths. Stalin (which Hitler started the war jointly with) was the responsible man for a lot of them, and other allies killed many too. I don't see estimates on how many people Stalin killed in his introduction, or how many people Churchill or Truman killed in their introductions.</p>
<dl>
<dd>There is a single positive line, about how he helped turned Germany around into one of the strongest nations around. I actually did try to think of a way to mention the Autobahn, but then again, it was done with virtual slave labor; that would be like praising the Confederacy for all the things the slaves grew. This article isn't about Stalin or Churchill or Truman, perhaps their articles should be edited. However, the fact remains - Without Hitler, there would not have been a WW2 in Europe. He started it. Therefore, the deaths are on him. --<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolbez_ce9f.html" title="User:Golbez">Golbez</a> 22:32, May 11, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Also, there is no doubt Stalin is as much "reviled" as Hitler. When I put it in the Stalin article, it was removed. I feel "reviled" has nothing in this article to do if it is not also included in the Stalin article. In any event, Hitler was a popular politician in his lifetime in the country he ruled, I feel that is more important. You know, George Bush is very "reviled" both in Europe and the Arab world those days too, but would the US-Americans accept that we added it to the Bush article? The same applies to <a href="../../../a/r/i/Ariel_Sharon_de21.html" title="Ariel Sharon">Ariel Sharon</a>, probably one of the most reviled people in the world and almost universally considered a notorious war criminal. --83</p>

<dd>We don't have reviled in the lead, so this does not seem like a current argument.

<p>The current article seems to claim Hitler was the only one responsible for WWII in Europe. This is obviously incorrect. From 1939 on, Stalin attacked Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and a bunch of other countries. Stalin was as responsible as Hitler, if not even more. The German annexations had all to do with incorporating territory where it lived Germans and which had for a large part until recently been part of Germany or Austria. It was the allies who decided to turn it into a world war when they declared war on Germany (however, not on the Soviet Union, for some reason).</p>

<dd>Hitler was NOT a vegetarian. He ate meat, his fave food was a type of sausage and something else meaty, and he only occasionally took a break from eating meat on the advice of his doctor. Also, to be a true vegetarian you aren't supposed to use animal products, and he used a lot of leather. Also, if Hitler was a vegetarian, then he would have pushed his officers to be as well, as he pushed them not to smoke. --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilversmith_d59b.html" title="User:Silversmith">Silversmith</a> 11:43, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Two important points (on top of his eating meat): "If Hitler had been a vegetarian, he would not have banned vegetarian organizations in Germany and the occupied countries; nor would he have failed to urge a meatless diet on the German people as a way of coping with Germany’s World War II food shortage." - Rynn Berry, author.

<dd>His banning of vegetarian organizations is news to me, so I speak with no authority; but I would speculate that the rationale for the ban had something to do with political considerations other than their vegetarianism. Regarding the urging of a meatless diet for Germany, someone told me there was a weekly vegetarian meal adopted by Hitler's household and encouraged for all Germany (when I asked for the source, they thought it might have been in one of <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Speer_ddb0.html" title="Albert Speer">Albert Speer</a>'s works). In <i>The Nazi War on Cancer</i>, by Robert N. Proctor (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0691070512</a>), there is at least one chapter on the promotion of <a href="../../../s/o/y/Soy_bean.html" title="Soy bean">soy beans</a> as a positive alternative to meat (going so far as to rename them: "Nazi beans"). —<a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorning_star_a8a3.html" title="User:Morning star">Morning star</a> 14:41, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Typically these things start out on the main page, and get shuttled off to separate articles as they grow. There's not much point to having a one-paragraph article on Hitler and vegetarianism, for example.

<p>We have "...his Third Reich," "...his armies," "Hitler's attempt..." and especially "His racial policies...." While obscuring the personal responsibility Hitler had for the horrors of the Third Reich, the Holocaust and World War II would be wrong, this makes it sound like he was the sole motivator of all of these, when in fact he had many willing, enthusiastic and creative confederates. The "his..." "his..." "his..." structure leaves little room for culpability outside of the man himself.</p>
<p>I greatly prefer the "his armies" statement to the former (strange) "military-industrial complex he fostered" but I dislike "his racial policies...," which, despite his enthusiastic acceptance, promulgation and direction, were descended from widespread antisemitism and racism that Hitler hardly invented. The Third Reich had many architects; the victims of the Holocaust many murderers.</p>
<p>We should remove some of the "personal ownership" words in the introduction, qualify some and leave others. In particular, I recommend "...the Third Reich," "...his armies," "Hitler's nationalistic attempt..." and "The racial policies he adopted and directed..." or something similar.</p>

<dd>It <i>was</i> <i>his</i> Third Reich, though perhaps we should say "Germany's armies". We could also change "His racial policies" to "Nazi Germany's racial policies", which gives us a chance to link Nazi Germany in the lead. If possible, we could mention <i>Mein Kampf</i>, but that could make it too long. We should still keep his attempt; he was leader. Due to the comments (about not changing the lead before talking about it), I propose the following changes <b>"At the height of his <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_Reich_a799.html" title="Third Reich">Third Reich</a>, the armies of <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_Germany_add9.html" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> had conquered and dominated most of <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>."</b>.</dd>

<p>On the ground that there is only one primary cause, by definition (there are other meanings of "primary" that allow plurals ("primary colors"), but "first in rank of importance", the one used here, isn't one of them). "Primary" does not mean "only", so other factors are not excluded by this wording.

<p>I'm not that happy with this sentence. What one considers causes can vary depending on the scope of your definition. I doubt a reader of <a href="../../../c/a/u/Causes_of_World_War_II_acab.html" title="Causes of World War II">Causes of World War II</a> would, however, cast this in quite the way we have, which ascribes so much of the moving force behind the war to one man alone (as in, if he had never thought of it, it wouldn't have happened, which is not a rock-solid assertion).</p>
<p>Secondly, I'm not sure <a href="../../../g/r/o/Grossdeutschland.html" title="Grossdeutschland">Grossdeutschland</a> actually means what one would think it means from the context here, and the term is not mentioned in either <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> or <a href="../../../c/a/u/Causes_of_World_War_II_acab.html" title="Causes of World War II">Causes of World War II</a> (clearly Hitler attempted to subjugate other states, not just unite German-speaking lands under one rule, which is what the term implies to me).

<p>Not that this makes writing the intro easier, mind you.

"His racial policies of systematic genocide" fails to cover the entire scope (it certainly wasn't genocide from the beginning), and "culminated" makes it much clearer that what is known as the Holocaust was something that was gradually built up to. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 23:10, 2005 May 13 (UTC)</p>

<p>It did not occupy Great Britain, Iceland, Ireland, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Zwitzerland, Italy, Romania, Hungary, Finland,Sweden, Kazakhstan, Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, most of the European part of Russia was still free as well.

<p>Sorry, but there is some mistake in this article. Hitlers book is not prohibited in Germany. The only thing is, that the Free State of Bavaria holds the copyright for it (which will expire around 2015) and doesnt allow any reproductions of it (and will actively pursuit unallowed reprints by means of copyrightlaw). But you are freely allowed to trade old examples of the book. see also <a href="http://www.damaschke.de/marginalia/1998/anfrage-1998-07-12.php" class="external free" title="http://www.damaschke.de/marginalia/1998/anfrage-1998-07-12.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.damaschke.de/marginalia/1998/anfrage-1998-07-12.php</a> (in german) i hope this will be changed, because it just boosts a wide-spread misbelieve among many germans about censorship in germany even more (not that there is none).</p>

<dd>That's one point out of four. Hitler's invasion marked the beginning of World War II. It did so because others declared war on Germany, which is neatly described in our article on <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, as well as this article. But is there a particular reason it has to appear in the <i>intro</i>? Furthermore, you removed the link to <a href="../../../c/a/u/Causes_of_World_War_II_acab.html" title="Causes of World War II">causes of World War II</a>, which is a lot more useful in providing perspective on matters than saying "France and the UK declared war".</dd>
<dd>The "Greater Germany" link is misleading; this is discussed above (under "you started it!").</dd>
<dd>Why was any mention of the Holocaust removed? I hope we're not disputing that this is a significant (possibly the <i>most significant</i>) aspect of Hitler's rule.</dd>
<dd>"The old version is not objective": you'll have to be more specific than that. What's wrong with it? <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 15:12, 2005 May 15 (UTC)

<dd>I think that presenting Hitler as a cartoonish monster is inappropriate for encyclopedia. The real life is much more complicated. For example the number of Japanese victims is not mantioned in the intro of <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_S._Truman_d2df.html" title="Harry S. Truman">Harry S. Truman</a>, by the way the number of Jews victims is DISPUTED. We should not blame Hitler on evey "bad think" that happened in his lifetime. --<a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHaham_hanuka_7d7e.html" title="User:Haham hanuka">Haham hanuka</a> 17:14, 15 May 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Which is why we take care not to do that in the article. Comparing Hitler to Truman is spurious, because the majority views on Truman do not include that he committed genocide on the Japanese people. Whether the <a href="../../../a/t/o/Atomic_bombing_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki_9c97.html" title="Atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki">atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki</a> was a justifiable act of war or a baseless atrocity is still contentious. Whether the Holocaust was justified is most definitely not.</dd>
<dd>It is not seriously disputed by anyone that Hitler had a great personal responsibility in drafting the racial policies of Nazi Germany, and that he likewise personally approved of the Holocaust. For right or wrong, the Jews are the most prominent victims of the Holocaust, being the primary targets of those racial policies, and simply omitting that fact does nothing to make the intro better.</dd>
<dd>The number of Jewish victims is <i>not</i> disputed by any reputable source, and if you think otherwise, I suggest you get that number altered in all other places, by consensus and referencing sources, before you dispute it in the intro here. See <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">Holocaust denial</a>, in which (among other things) claims of incorrect numbers are thoroughly debunked. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 17:40, 2005 May 15 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think it would be better to remove numbers of the victims from the intro, including the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_casualties_bbf9.html" title="World War II casualties">World War II casualties</a>. The <a href="../../../a/t/o/Atomic_bombing_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki_9c97.html" title="Atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki">atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki</a> is not a genocide but the number of Japanese who died as a result is not mentioned in <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_S._Truman_d2df.html" title="Harry S. Truman">Harry S. Truman</a>, PS the "real" number of the Jewish victims according to <a href="../../../y/a/d/Yad_Vashem_56e6.html" title="Yad Vashem">Yad Vashem</a> is 5,860,129. --<a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHaham_hanuka_7d7e.html" title="User:Haham hanuka">Haham hanuka</a> 09:29, 16 May 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Again, the comparison is flawed. The number of WW II casualties and Jewish victims is much more notable than the number of Japanese victims at the atomic bombings—mainly because they're much larger than any individual number of casualties in any war. I'm not saying this is a good thing or that the Japanese victims deserve to be ignored, but this is the majority view as I see it.</dd>
<dd>What's more, you yourself put in that World War II caused "destruction and suffering on an unprecedented scale". How is this an improvement over calling it a "total war [...] that led to the deaths of over 30 million people"? The latter is far more informative to the reader than just saying it was "unprecedented". Mind you, we are not saying that Hitler himself killed 30 million people. We are not even saying that he killed 6 million, but we are saying he had a big part to play in both, and that isn't disputed by anyone.</dd>
<dd>"PS the "real" number of the Jewish victims according to <a href="../../../y/a/d/Yad_Vashem_56e6.html" title="Yad Vashem">Yad Vashem</a> is 5,860,129" Which, when rounded, is 6 million. Nobody is claiming that <i>exactly</i> 6 million people died. Using <a href="../../../y/a/d/Yad_Vashem_56e6.html" title="Yad Vashem">Yad Vashem</a>'s precise count instead of the number which has less accuracy but more sources backing it up doesn't seem like a good idea. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 10:26, 2005 May 16 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think Golbez's reversion to the previous intro structure is an improvement. We've previously established that it's desirable to mention his role in the origins of the war and its consequences. Doing so in an overly-explicated way, trying to qualify for each detail and exception (even in JRM's improved version) doesn't help. We link to the causes article, where those details and subtleties are examined, and we describe Germany's expansionism and invasion of Poland specifically as the start of the war. <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHaham_hanuka_7d7e.html" title="User:Haham hanuka">Haham hanuka</a>'s edits didn't improve anything and we are better off where we were before. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemi_6641.html" title="User:Demi">Demi</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/e/m/User_talk%7EDemi_ab67.html" title="User talk:Demi">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Demi_a1b0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Demi">C</a></sub> 21:02, 2005 May 15 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, Golbez changed it back, partly at my behest (I asked him about his reversion before this comment was made). I think the present version is not beyond saving—at least it fixes the equivocation the earlier version made about the annexation of Austria, the invasion of Czechoslovakia and the invasion of Poland to spark the war—only the last thing was the immediate cause, and it is true that the war began with the declaration of war on Germany (the remaining causes are, as you say, much more difficult to squeeze in). I think the intro just about gets away with it now. <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHaham_hanuka_7d7e.html" title="User:Haham hanuka">Haham hanuka</a>'s other suggestions I cannot fit in, because they degrade the factuality of the earlier version, as described in my comments above. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 23:47, 2005 May 15 (UTC)

<p>We grew to two sentences now describing the beginning of the war; in the interest of keeping the introduction a mere introduction, I have shortened it again, at some cost of detail.

<dd>I think the "reportedly" battle is hopeless, because we're turning on a dime here. I do not want to see us go back and forth between "reportedly", "apparently", "allegedly" or anything else ending in -ly. Any ideas we can all agree on? "Most likely"? "Generally accepted as"?

<p>I don't know whether this should be considered good or bad. On the one hand it suffers from the "Hitler was a German politician" syndrome (that is, it completely avoids everything of interest to Hitler's life); this is more like Britannica does it, but it's not usual on Wikipedia, and it also suggests that this is all there is to tell on Hitler if you had to summarize it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it's hard to argue that what <i>is</i> there isn't completely neutral. That's a lot of endless discussion out of the window right there.

<p>While one would wish to at least add "known for starting WWII and killing lots of Jews" one can not do that on wikipedia without opening the pandora's box of unending battle. At least a short intro like this keeps the fight and reverts to subsections and also allows a full discussion where those topics ARE mentioned so people can't cut off the other side of the story by saying it has to be kept short. In a provocative subject, a short intro helps keep the wasted energy to a minimum. 4.250.198.126 16:04, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>If the intro doesn't mention World War II then something is very wrong with it. It would be like writing an article on Abraham Lincoln without mentioning the Civil War. Nobody can seriously be in any doubt that Hitler started WWII; whatever other causes or provocations he may have had, he undoubtedly personally and repeatedly took decisions that clearly and knowingly led to the war. The persecution and killing is also without question. The only possible concession to the holocaust revisionists here might be not stating the number up front. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 17:32, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I actually think, depending on your definition of "start," you <i>can</i> be in such doubt. We do mention the war (twice, actually), but trying to add detail about whose fault it was just isn't working. Since that (and the consequences of the war in terms of bodies) seemed the really contentious point, I added some of the other things back in. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemi_6641.html" title="User:Demi">Demi</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/e/m/User_talk%7EDemi_ab67.html" title="User talk:Demi">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Demi_a1b0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Demi">C</a></sub> 17:36, 2005 May 16 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm not going to argue over the definition of 'start', any more than the definition of 'is'. To the level of accuracy required for an introductory paragraph, Hitler started WWII. You can argue that other people <i>caused</i> him to start it at some level, but even then he had the choice. His actions were the ones that initiated the war. Either way, the intro has to mention WWII. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 17:45, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>By all accounts hitler didn't want to fight england. He also <i>may</i> not have wanted to fight france (he thought they were both aryan, after all). He probably thought no one would be ballsy enough to do anything about him chopping up poland.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The racial policies Hitler directed...</span></h2>
<p>There's been a lot of wrangling over this part of the intro. I believe previous discussions have established it's desirable to mention Hitler's connection with establishing, or implementing, or directing these racial policies, though the exact verbiage has been a matter of some debate. I thought "directed" would be good, since it didn't imply Hitler invented these policies, which after all were influenced by others and grew out of racism and antisemitism that already existed; yet he did lead the effort and they were certainly "his" policies (we had a version that described them this way, but I thought that left no room for others who shared the policies).</p>
<p><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHaham_hanuka_7d7e.html" title="User:Haham hanuka">Haham hanuka</a> has several times removed mention of Hitler from the policies section, describing them only as policies of Nazi Germany. I invite others to suggest wording of this section of the intro that might be better. Perhaps "The racial policies Hitler and others directed...?" "...implemented...?" <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemi_6641.html" title="User:Demi">Demi</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/e/m/User_talk%7EDemi_ab67.html" title="User talk:Demi">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Demi_a1b0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Demi">C</a></sub> 17:20, 2005 May 19 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In my not so humble opinion we are putting way too much weight on small minority speculations and unfounded rumours by including that "said to have" part in the intro. It opens up for the possibility that he actually didn't commit suicide and even escaped. He didn't. Just as Elvis is dead, the Earth isn't 6000 years old and the aliens didn't build the pyramids, Hitler didn't escape to Argentina. There are people questioning all of those statements, but we can't drop "said to have"s all over the wikipedia because of them. I'd like the intro to read: Hitler died by suicide. Because he did. And thats how every other wikipedia states it (that I have checked), not to say every other encyclopedia. But we've had this debate on en before, and I don't have any hopes of getting ridd of the weaselwords this time either. They are sort of a compromise, and I'm only glad nobody is trying to be consistant and add question marks after the date of death in the header, too. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShanes_8450.html" title="User:Shanes">Shanes</a> 02:15, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Almost everybody agrees he died, but some feel he didn't (altho if he isn't dead by now, he'd be the worlds oldest man&#160;;) Stalin didn't believe the reports of his men, and for good reason. They were incredible, nearly impossible to believe if you read them in detail. Look into it. I agree it is <i>unlikely</i> he escaped, but the widely accepted account of his death - biting a glass capsel of cyanide while shooting himself in the head, both he and eva braun promptly burned and buried, and the area severely shelled. The evidence of this being an eye witness, a dentifrice, and a skull fragment (which Russia won't allow inspection of) - is nearly impossible, and most experts agree it is unlikely in its entirety. <big><i><b><a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a></b></i></big> 10:40, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
From the first week of May 1945 until the present, the consensus among oberservers and historians has been that Hitler committed suicide with his bride in that bunker. The details have shifted here and there, the story of suicide by both cyanide and pistol shot is obviously suspect, possibly related to propaganda (or spin) after the fact. My own impression is that, with Red Army tanks but metres away over their heads, AH shot himself after Braun bit into a cyanide capsule.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hitler and Popular Culture</span></h2>
<p>Hitler has left an indelible mark on mankind's perception of the ultimate villain. In recent times, it has become common practice to compare all <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megalomania.html" title="Megalomania">megalomaniac</a> villains in popular culture to Hitler. Among others, he has been compared to <a href="../../../s/a/r/Saruman.html" title="Saruman">Saruman</a> in the book <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_of_the_Rings_293e.html" title="Lord of the Rings">Lord of the Rings</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palpatine.html" title="Palpatine">The Emperor</a> in <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_fcb0.html" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a>, and <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Doom_f490.html" title="Dr. Doom">Dr. Doom</a> in the Marvel universe.</p>
<p><br />
Tolkien, I believe, specifically denied that Saruman was inspired by or analog to Hitler. The comparisons were made because he wrote a good part of LTR during WW2. I'm happy to see the above was deleted, it's too fuzzy and likely overstated, unreferenced, not encyclopedic and the term <i>villain</i> seems somehow too narrow, even misleading. Besides, I'm one of those who think making AH into a characature of evil isn't helpful, since it weakens peoples' ability to spot the next genocidal sociopath who shows up in the guise of a charismatic, talented populist politician... along these same lines even Charles Chaplin, after the war, said he regretted having satirized AH. Saying any of <i>that</i> in the article would be unencyclopedic as well. One might rather be happy with keeping the article objective, since the documented background on this topic speaks plainly, glaringly. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 15:40, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree with Wyss. I believe we "inherit" this section from the editors of <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palpatine.html" title="Palpatine">Palpatine</a> (see <a href="../../../p/a/l/Talk%7EPalpatine_a081.html#Comparison_To_Hitler.2C_Belongs_In_Hitler_Article.3F" title="Talk:Palpatine">Talk:Palpatine#Comparison To Hitler, Belongs In Hitler Article?</a>). I think it's improper organization to mention the "inspiration" of anyone who might have created a Hitler-like villain in this article--surely it goes in the villain's? Secondly, the comparison would have to part of notable debate, discussion and criticism, not our own speculation or that from some Internet forums or movie reviews (which are, after all, not proper sources of Hitler scholoarship). I could see including information about artistic criticism of Hitler himself, such as from <i>The Great Dictator</i>, but not this business with Palpatine from Star Wars. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemi_6641.html" title="User:Demi">Demi</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/e/m/User_talk%7EDemi_ab67.html" title="User talk:Demi">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Demi_a1b0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Demi">C</a></sub> 17:39, 2005 Jun 4 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree w the removal, but assume good faith in regards to the anon, and don't suspect he'll need any special watching. This info should be on the palpitine/Saruman/Dr. Doom articles, if anywhere (IMO its a very shoddy comparison).
