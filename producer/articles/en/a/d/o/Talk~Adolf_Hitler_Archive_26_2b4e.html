<h2><span class="mw-headline">Historiographical methods</span></h2>
<p>The only interesting thing to have emerged from the above sections is that historiographical methods are themselves indicative of a stance and open to question, not just among a bunch of anonymous editors but also among serious historians.</p>
<p>To say life under Hitler was "relatively benign" (ex. Michael) or that it's not up to us to decide who was the "average" or "good German" (ex. Yooden) may both be statements that reveal no POV for or against Hitler (the subject of the article) but have disturbing repercussions for the documentation of the subject itself as one of the views appears to unintentionally buy into the ideologies behind what constitutes "normality" and consequently exclusion.</p>
<p>Similarly, "terror" (which I only favour over the contextually meaningless "coercion", but not on its own terms) can be interpreted as widespread physical violence, or something in combination with psychological oppression, or mostly repression with the threat of violence, and the exact nature of its extent will continue being under debate - especially with Nazism, where there are at least two well-known views, ie that there was not much 'terror' in Germany because 'mainstream' Germans themselves took the initiative in repressing minorities, and the more 'official version', ie without the rise and rule of the Nazi party, the minorities may never have faced as much suffering as they did.</p>
<p>There are a large number of books with a variety of views. Any historical period is complex and no one can sum up that complexity in a few phrases, much less one word. There is clearly no neutral point of view, anyone who insists otherwise is being extremely silly and/or ignorant.</p>
<p>However, my objection all along has been and continues to be that without mentioning the many <i>documented, violent atrocities</i> against Germans of <i>whatever background</i> in the days of Nazism <i>before the war</i>, one is doing a disservice to those victims and since they were of sufficient number to deserve mention in the header, the word chosen needs to at least reflect the gravity of the situation and the specific nature of the atrocities instead of deflecting them to vague bodies ("paramilitary", etc). It's much more crucial than say, explaining the origins of WW2 which has its own lengthy article.</p>
<p>So here we go again... -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 00:00, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Then find a way to mention them specifically in the intro. The atrocities against Jewish people in 1930s Germany are widely-documented and not at all disputed among serious historians. Meanwhile, the current use of the term <i>terror</i> is wholly misleading. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 00:06, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>We are trying to find a way, here. Terror is not misleading so much as not being informative enough, but as a vagary (since Michael and you both agree that vagaries are sufficient) it is a much better one than either "paramilitarism" or "coercion", with perhaps less of the connotations of "violence". Since the discrete nature of the events versus the generalisations of chosen words bothers us, we could perhaps settle for "acts of ... (violence/terror/brutality/etc)". -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 00:23, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Don't get me wrong, but I think <i>terror</i> has been the least helpful choice yet. AH did not ride into power in D on a wave of terror and violence. Yeah, there was some beerhall thuggery and violent Jew-baiting but they aren't characterised as such in the intro. The problem is that to keep the intro both precise and balanced, it could turn into a small article of its own. I say it's already too long. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 00:32, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The acts of terror were by and large deliberately focused against Jewish people and took place mostly after the Enabling Act. The intro implies he got into office through terror which is not historically supported. Personally, I don't think any summary of WW2 is needed, the briefest mention would do (for me), perhaps as prelude to a mention of his suicide. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 00:42, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>One thing to bear in mind, though: The reference to the Holocaust is IMHO spot on and belongs "as is" in the intro. This, combined with the existing reference to anti-semitism which you've added (and which is a bit of a spin- most of the eletorate grew up as anti-semites anyway), could give readers the false impression that AH was given power in Germany in order to embark on a crusade of destruction against anyone and everything Jewish and that is not a supported view. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 00:11, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Excuse the cliche, but let's not open a new can of worms. The talk of economic need, crises and oratory are a sufficient counterweight.

<dl>
<dd>I think it had best be opened. The intro is somewhat misleading now and is steadily degenerating into a summary which would be more suitable for Adolf Hitler's anti-Semitism, for which, with a tweak or two, it would not be "degenerated" at all. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 00:37, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Here, Simonides, is where we disagree so starkly. While I recognize the importance of aggressively and plainly describing the horrors of the Holocaust, AH's rise to power was not based on his anti-Semitic appeal. Indeed, most educated people thought he was laying on the anti-Semitism a bit too thickly, and mostly for rabble-rousing propaganda purposes. One way or another the camps came as a shock to most Germans, even given the nominal anti-Semitism most people grew up with then. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 00:57, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>I never wrote that his rise to power was based exclusively on his anti-Semitism, but I did say it was very important, and few would deny that.</li>
<li>It is not true that the camps came as a shock 'to most Germans' (perhaps to many, but "to most" is arguable), which is something recent works have tried to show, and this is something I've tried to explain further below. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 07:04, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with Wyss that anti-Semitism certainly was not the prime factor in Hitler's appeal and hence I have consistently relegated it to the end of the trias economics, nationalis, a-S. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 12:16, 4 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've said the same myself so we all agree. My only caveat being that the anti-Semitism cannot be understated. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 20:12, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The reality of the camps indeed came as a shock to these Germans that were forced by the allies to see the camps (as in Buchenwald) or that saw them in the cinema. That doesn't mean that they couldn't have known before. There's an interesting saying: "People didn't know all but they knew enough that knew that they didn't want to know more!" So, in a way, a non-invincibly ignorance. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 12:16, 4 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>In terms of the importance of anti-semitism in Hitler's rise to power, I think it's not right to suggest that anti-semitism was a principal cause leading people to vote for the Nazis. It just wasn't - the Nazis' miserable failure in the 1928 elections shows the very limited appeal that straight-up anti-semitism, in the absence of any other appealing program, had on the German electorate. That said, anti-semitism always remained an extremely important, if not central, aspect of the Nazis' own program (although it was somewhat played down in the 1930-1932 period). <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 21:36, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Nuremberg Tribunal and questions of 'legality' in Hitler, Kaas and related Wikipedia Articles</span></h2>
<p>Forgive me breaking in , but I refer good editors to the Indictment made against the Nazis and other parties as totheir Conspiracy or Common Purpose. There have been numerous attempts made directly to me, and directly within the Wikipedia presentation of the overall Nazi History, to claim that Hitler came to power legally, that he was voted into power legally, that he had an accession to power. This informs everything from <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> downwards so , since a User, a usual User, managed to set a Wikipedia Archiving record of <i>precisely six minutes</i> to separately Archive the relevant Nuremberg Indictment covering the so called <i>accession</i> to power, may I leave this link to that sourced Indictment? It is at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ludwig_Kaas/Archive2" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ludwig_Kaas/Archive2" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ludwig_Kaas/Archive2</a> ,[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ludwig_Kaas/Archive2" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ludwig_Kaas/Archive2" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>]. To reduce it to its pith, others were incited to join with the conspiracy towards the <i>paragovernmental organisation</i>, the conspirators <i>possessed themselves</i> of the machinery of the German State, and they<i>reduced the Reichstag</i> to a body of their nominees. There was no legality in the possession nor in the reducing, and statements as to legality of Hitler's achievement of power should not be supported in the Articles, nor those <i>others incited</i> allowed the assumption of legality and such good faith as this and other Articles maintain, even by omission. <a href="../../../e/f/f/User%7EEffK_b5e6.html" title="User:EffK">EffK</a> 00:39, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>And thereby the Article entry of AH establishing power is utterly un-historical, and kind. If you wish to be kind to Hitler, by all means be so, but know what you do by remaining with this, in effect, disinformation. No disrespect intended to these above editors, who are presented with the earlier dis-information. <a href="../../../e/f/f/User%7EEffK_b5e6.html" title="User:EffK">EffK</a> 00:46, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is hindsight semantics. The force of law was convincing enough to the establishment at the time. There is a legal problem with the Nazis having coerced the exclusion of socialist deputies from the Reichstag, but at the time even this was "justified" through sundry emergency powers rationales. The constitution itself was (deliberately) flawed in 1918 and the flaws were for the most part cleaned up in the post war Bonn constitution. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 00:52, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The use of the term <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terror.html" title="Terror">terror</a> in the intro is open to the same criticism as the current use of the term <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_on_Terror_fa24.html" title="War on Terror">War on Terror</a>. <i>Terror</i> is the state induced in the victim, and not the politically-motivated means by which that state is induced, the term for which is <i>terrorism</i> - but would <i>terrorism</i> (rather than, say, <i>paramilitarism</i>) be appropriate in this article? Perhaps <i>police intimidation and paramilitary brutality</i> gives the right combination.</li>
<li>We've had it out before on the length of the introduction. Most are agreed that the inclusion of <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> is appropriate, but it seems to me that this justifies the inclusion of other aspects of Hitler's career, leading to over-<b>accomplishment</b>. I suggested an even lengthier intro (<b>Intro again</b> section above) - for the sake of readability - but if the intro is to be brief, then it should be confined to - <b>Name/DOB-DOD/parents/education/war-service/party leadership/chancellorship/caused (or provoked or started) WWII/defeat</b>.

He apparently believed it (it's the final thing he mentioned in his last politcal will hours before he killed himself), but in 1933 this was background noise to the German political brokers and industrialists who supported him.</li>
</ul>
<p>Through adroit political skill applied through years of risky effort and with the support of large swaths of the German establishment, AH got himself appointed chancellor, used the Enabling Act to achieve dictatorial powers, then set out to "save the world" in his image. Few people understood until it was far too late that whatever his beliefs, charisma, leadership skills or other talents, he was a stark raving mad lunatic.</p>
<p>The pith of his incompetence, which many (but not all) of his closest supporters came to accept, was that he left Germany (and Europe) in ruins with millions of Germans dead and even more with shattered lives. Then we ponder the tens of millions more who died, the notion that civilization (such as it is) was set back perhaps a generation.</p>

<dd>This issue is more complex than you paint it, and that's something I tried to explain when speaking of "methods". To sample the variety of opinions on the debate, simply go to Amazon.com and look up some of these authors: Kershaw, Gellately, Peukert, Dawidowicz, Bartov, Hilberg, etc to name a few. As some historians will tell you, Hitler's anti-intellectualism, anti-Marxism, and especially anti-Semitism were certainly not just "background noise", and while it may not have been of tremendous importance in 1933, its drastic escalation was only possible for a web of reasons that no scholar has explained away in absolute terms; secondly, some historians will also tell you that much of what you attribute to Hitler could also be attributed to the Nazi platform (not shaped entirely by Hitler) and to Goebbel's unprecedented propaganda (which, obviously, sought to create an image of Hitler that had little to do with Hitler the person); thirdly, there is no specific set of reasons/origins/etc that all historians/biographers agree on, so someone who diminishes Hitler's role in every aspect (as Bullock does, by trying to show Hitler as an ambitious but hateful and otherwise not very exceptional man who serendipitously ended up with as much power as he did) may also diminish the role of his particular anti-Semitism (by highlighting the responsibility of the general populace, as Gellately does), and someone who tends to vaunt Hitler a bit (like Shirer) may also keep emphasizing the importance of Nazi anti-Semitism, and so on - there are many reasons for Hitler's appeal, but there is no standard opinion on what constitutes the "true proportions". -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 06:56, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>EffK, I am sorry to say but you appearently have no clue what the discussion is about. A journalist in 1933 can write about his observations and perceptions but he certainly cannot give a fully and comprehensive picture. Neither can a book from 1936, regardless how hard it tries. That's why the debate goes on, that's why books are still published. There is no one easy answer to this. If you want the manifesto to appear then include it.

<dd>This is so true. Have you guys ever read microfiches of newspapers from the era? The general perception then was much different from the one we have now (since historians have had access to so much that wasn't publicised then, never mind the benefits of hindsight) and often, much more sympathetic to AH btw, mostly since nobody yet knew tens of millions would die because of his amazingly inept actions. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 19:19, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, Nobody knew millions would die, but the latter, rather obvious fact doesn't illuminate much on the degree to which racial theories etc. played a role. One more time, no one here has argued for the centrality of anti-Semitism, anti-intellectualism and so on, but they were always worrisome aspects of Nazism. That they ended up causing a shocking number of deaths doesn't mean that everyone was placid or clueless till they realised the full extent of the crimes. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 00:34, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It seems you don't care much for historical subtleties. That the anti-Semitism cannot be overstated is perfectly consistent with saying it was not something central, and I have stated the latter since I began participating here. Let me rephrase: a) there are no quantifiable scales of how serious the anti-Semitism was in terms of their overall traumatic effects; b) anti-Semitism was not the only platform of the Nazi party; do you see how the two are compatible statements?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The anti-Semitism was legislated and rather traumatic for Jewish people who didn't (or couldn't) get out of the way. Quantifiable? He came close to wiping out the Jewish population of Europe. However, in 1933 it was not at all clear he would actually attempt to do this. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 01:48, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Wiping out a population is not merely about numbers, and anyway we are not talking about the later systematic genocide but the general anti-Semitism before the war. Secondly, you keep repeating this meaningless line about what people knew (or did not) in 1933, which I already replied to above - the short answer being <i>so what</i>? What people "knew" or "predicted" about the final outcome is no indication of the degree to which anti-Semitism played a role, a topic on which - <b>one more time</b> - there is no clear consensus among scholars, but they all agree it was significant - and which, although <b>it was not the main or only cause of Nazi popularity, and no one claims the latter</b> cannot be ignored in any short summary as redundant or 'background noise'. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 05:38, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This has of course discussed already, but I think that triggered is undisputed and started is somewhat doubtful because the English declared war on Germany after Germany invaded Poland.

Granted, had Britain and France not honored their treaties we wouldn't be talking about <i>World'</i> war II but only about the Germano-Polish war 1939, but it was a war nonetheless - a war that came to be called World War II. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 21:23, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>Please understand Str1977, that I am not arguing for the sake of argument - just want to point out two things.

However, votes commonly decide some issues on WP and on this high-traffic article it makes sense to agree on a final header so that our collective efforts are better spent on preventing vandalism, improving other articles, and adding to other sections on the same page. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 00:23, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Str1977 isn't the only other editor involved here. I think you're aware others have mentioned your behaviour here has not been generally helpful. Given your repeated remarks about other editors, I must say your tone is consistantly judgemental, arrogant, shrill and emotional. IMHO your edits have been deliberately designed to emphasize a personal agenda and have tended to slant the introduction towards unsupported and misleading interpretations. Other editors have plainly addressed these issues too, see above. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 00:45, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a name="Proposal" id="Proposal"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Proposal</span></h3>
<p>Certainly I am not the only editor around here. My proposal is the following:</p>
<p><i>Hitler gained power in a <a href="../../../w/e/i/Weimar_Republic_9fad.html" title="Weimar Republic">Germany facing crises</a>. He used <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charismatic_authority.html" title="Charismatic authority">charismatic</a> oratory and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html#Nazi_Germany" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a> to appeal to economic need, <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalism.html" title="Nationalism">nationalism</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">anti-Semitism</a> and established a <a href="../../../t/o/t/Totalitarianism.html" title="Totalitarianism">totalitarian</a> regime. After the economy had been rebuilt and the military rearmed, Hitler commenced an <a href="../../../l/e/b/Lebensraum.html#Hitler_and_Lebensraum" title="Lebensraum">expansionist foreign policy</a> that triggered <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>. By 1940 Germany and the <a href="../../../a/x/i/Axis_Powers_169f.html" title="Axis Powers">Axis Powers</a> occupied much of <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>, but they were defeated by the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allies_of_World_War_II_afb4.html" title="Allies of World War II">Allies</a> in 1945. By then, Hitler's <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_policy_of_Nazi_Germany_b7c8.html" title="Racial policy of Nazi Germany">racial policies</a> had culminated in a <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genocide.html" title="Genocide">genocide</a> now known as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Holocaust_8edb.html" title="The Holocaust">the Holocaust</a>. The death toll is commonly cited as about 11 million people, including about 6 million <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jews</a>.</i></p>
<ul>
<li>I agree that the persecution is already covered under Holocaust, and that currently it looks clumsy.</li>
<li>I am willing to yield on the word "started" but not to the arguments used around here. It is the plain hard fact that Nazi Germany started the war on 1 September 1939. It is as accurate as it can get. But I am willing to consider a version of "triggered" or "led to", if you guys finally concede the accuracy of what I am saying.</li>

<dd>Between you and me, on this talk page, yeah, he started it but in encyclopedic terms the word <i>triggered</i> implies that Europe was already primed for war and provides a more helpful context for the successful bluffing strategy he had been employing, along with leaving open for the reader the distinct possibility he thought he might get away with it one more time (which is to say, again skirt England and France declaring war on Germany). I also agree with Andries that <i>started</i> carries an unencyclopedic implication of moral judgement (let the reader do that). <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 01:39, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Since Str1977's proposed paragraph is largely in agreement with the comments offered by four other editors (including myself), I've copy-pasted it verbatim into the article. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 01:29, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><i>Provoked</i> rather than <i>started</i> or <i>triggered</i> - accurate and connotes culpability. <i>A Germany facing crises</i> is plain awkward, as is <i>appeal to economic need</i> (the appeal was to those suffering in the conditions, not to the conditions). On the death tolls, the word <i>about</i> is otiose. I'm inclined to the earlier view of <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a>, that the intro should deal with the essentials of the man's life: otherwise, the argument is prone to flare up whenever an opinionated user first encounters all the opinion in the intro.--<a href="../../../s/h/t/User%7EShtove_8f32.html" title="User:Shtove">shtove</a> 01:59, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>In the article, the section is currently in italics. We don't need to be <i>that</i> "verbatim".:)</li>
<li>As I repeated in <a href="../../../a/d/o/Talk%7EAdolf_Hitler_3520.html#The_word_.22violence.22" title="Talk:Adolf Hitler">this section</a> it is important to note the arbitrary terror/persecution/violence etc against everyone the Nazis disliked, such as Communists, gypsies, Jews and so on (over a period of six years between 1933 to 1939) versus the more intensified and a lot more systematic genocide that more or less started with the onset of the war. I would appreciate if we could agree on some phrase to add in the header that would reflect this long and rather disturbing period under Nazism.</li>
<li>I am fine with triggered, but I also think Shtove's proposal of provoked is a reasonable compromise. Whatever the word chosen - no strong opinion either way - "triggered" certainly has none of the extensive connotations that some editors conjure up.</li>
<li>'Economy rebuilt' sounds very awkward.</li>

<dd>As as been pointed out repeatedly above by at least three editors, I believe, the general persecution is already handled in inroductory form through the "racial policies/Holocaust" sentence. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 02:47, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The <i>Economy rebuilt</i> wording in that sentence IMHO does need minor tweaking, only as to syntax and word forms. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 02:47, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've just made the necessary edits.</dd>
<dd>The "racial policies" phrase, once again,</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>suggests nothing about other marginalized groups such as homosexuals, Leftists of various stripes but especially Communists, and so on.</li>
<li>The six year period before the war is not generally considered part of the <i><a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a></i>, the latter referring more to the systematized killing rather than the domestic persecution. In any other country or era, six years of such persecution would warrant mention, but in this case they are simply (unfairly) being subsumed under the later atrocities due to their scope.</li>
<li>It's a bit of a historical simplification if left out. There'd be no insight into your own repetitive badgering on how the Germans had "no idea" what the ultimate consequences were, and suggests that Nazism went straight from mere prejudice to the extermination of millions. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 03:13, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Simonides, you have changed <i>rebuilt</i> to <i>recovered</i>. I don't think <i>recovered</i> is accurate and gives AH and the Nazis too much credit for fiscal responsibility, since the economy was rebuilt largely on aramaments spending financed by deficit spending and massive borrowing. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 03:06, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just a quick note: "provoked" is utterly unacceptable. It implies that Hitler teased others until they started the war, when in fact Germany was the first to march. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 10:18, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Provoked is what it is - no implication of teasing. Hitler provoked other states, to the point that they declared war - and it was a justified war.--<a href="../../../s/h/t/User%7EShtove_8f32.html" title="User:Shtove">shtove</a> 14:00, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't like provoked either, mainly because it implies an accusatory moral judgement, liked <i>started</i>. IMO this conclusion is accurate, but not an appropriate one to assert in the intro to a long and detailed article like this.</dd>
