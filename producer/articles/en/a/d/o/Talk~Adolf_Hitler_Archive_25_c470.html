<dl>
<dd>Brute force may be op-ed language, but it is not untruthful; if you want references and scholarly material, look up the acclaimed "Nazi Germany and the Jews" by Saul Friedlander. Here's a quote from the early pages in my copy: "Anti-Jewish violence spread (my note: SPREAD, not BEGUN) after the March elections... In Breslau, Jewish lawyers and judges were assaulted in the court building... in Gedern, the SA (Storm Troopers) broke into Jewish homes and beat up the inhabitants... The list of similar incidents is a long one. There were also killings... (etc.)... Much of the foreign press gave wide coverage to the Nazi violence." Also note, on the previous page: "The primary political targets of the new regime and of its terror system, at least during the first months after the Nazi accession to power, were not Jews but Communists." Also look at the works "Holocaust: A History" by Deborak Dwork and Robert Jan van Pelt, "Holocaust" by Martin Gilbert. Jews were being publicly humiliated in the streets by police, arrested, their homes were broken into and wrecked, and groups of Jews started being transported to concentration camps almost right away. All the scholars mentioned are reputable, not hacks like Goldhagen or other agenda-driven ultra-Zionists. Brute force or some variant needs to be reinstated. I think the onus is on you to prove the contrary, particularly this absurd statement "for the first several years lots of Germans didn't find him brutal at all". -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 00:27, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, they used violent means.

<li>Why "violent" is not redundant &amp; op-ed langauge</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>At least three users don't seem to understand the diff between saying police powers were involved and violent police power was involved. It's very simple, it helps if you know a little history:
<ol>
<li>Stalinist Russia was a police state in which millions were deported, tortured, executed without fair trial, etc. Police and para-military forces were involved, of course. However, unlike Nazi Germany, these forces did not beat up people on the streets, in their homes, in full view of others, and so on. The Post-Stalinist era did not see great changes in method; of course, the arbitrariness, censorship and death toll decreased drastically, but the Soviet Union remained a very strict police state.</li>
<li>East Germany, practically micro-managed by the Stasi, was a police state which used similar methods, again with lower numbers of victims and with less visibility, but with equally dangerous consequences for anyone implicated in any "subversive" activity. The same extends to other Soviet "satellite states" like Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, etc.</li>
<li>North Korea, and certain Latin American, Middle Eastern and African countries are among modern police states with the grimmest human rights records. Once again, military and police forces are always under the government in these countries, but they do not all engage in public violence against citizens.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>As shown above, all of the Nazi violence was of a different order and the words chosen are perhaps better than "brute force"... Finally, NPOV is not about giving equal time to every single opinion and making every personality look like a mix of good and bad. It's about using unbiased information to project a contextually accurate picture. Trying to throw in information about, for ex., how much Hitler loved little furry animals to "balance" an article is no longer about NPOV, it's about being un/able to judge the value of facts. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 04:53, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Zimbabwe, from time to time yes. I don't know enough about Guatemala; North Korea - the streets are practically deserted a lot of the time. Please look at what I'm saying - secret/ military police are violent, but not always publicly, and that's what I want to emphasize. It's not about "spelling out methods". Are you deliberately being trivialising? Do you think the difference between public violence and humiliation and secret torture is just a question of method? In the Soviet Union it was possibly to deny torture and it is true that even now many people don't know/ don't believe in Stalinist crimes, in Russia. In Nazi Germany the crowds cheered on. Talking about his violent methods is specific. Mentioning "keen political skills" is judgement. I find your judgement on the header rather skewed, not for any partisan reasons, but probably simply because you don't want any changes. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 10:46, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hitler's anti-Semitism and his use of violence are NOT gray areas, they ARE significant aspects of Hitler's popularity (both within his party and among the public) and rule, they are VERY well documented, your own "sources" back this up, he was not responsible for the SYSTEMATIC deaths of more "ordinary" Germans than Jews/Communists, the use of violence went well beyond merely "Jew baiting", and all the scholarly works I cited above go into GREAT detail about both these aspects of Nazism, in fact you could say <i>Nazi Germany and the Jews</i>, which only covers the period from 1933-1939 by the way - ie BEFORE the war - is about this subject only. You're just wrong on this and if you look up the books I mention (which are just ones I own by the way, there must be several others), you'll understand. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 02:27, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As for the use of the word coercion: "coercion" implies that people were being forced into doing something specific. In fact, apart from the public humiliation in which Jews were forced to clean latrines in front of crowds etc, people were not being "coerced" - they were being beaten up, deported or killed. That's why I used "violence." -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 01:36, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Violence is a broader and more accurate category than "coercion"; it's like the difference between saying Hitler ruled Germany and Hitler ruled Bavaria.

<dd>Truth be told I think coercion is the broader category. Lots of Germans complied (or, say, "adapted") because it was easier than getting one's head lopped off or starving to death in a Gestapo cell or concentration camp. The <i>implied threat</i> of violence is a much wider and more efftive tool than violence itself. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 02:08, 1 February 2006 (UTC)\</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">The word "violence" - other comments</span></h3>
<p>I don't think the word 'violence' is particularly elegant or all that applicable to how the National Socialists established power. Concentration camps, certainly, and events like the Night of the Long Knives were certainly violent, but Hitler's rise to power was done democratically, and the totalitarian state created was based more on fear and threat of violence than actual violence itself. Once private ownership of firearms was curtailed and opposing parties made illegal, the potential for violence was greatly reduced. I think a better word can be found also. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Dorosh_6aa0.html" title="User:Michael Dorosh">Michael Dorosh</a> 05:32, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Michael, there was more violence after Hitler established power than before (I want to use the word in reference to Hitler's rule, not his rise to power). It's a fact, it's neither opinion nor elegant summary. See the sources quoted above. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 05:36, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't believe you make a credible case; I agree with the others - violence is the wrong word to use. It brings to mind visions of anarchy, which the Third Reich most certainly was not. Any threats of violence came from a very ordered vision of society, and friction was created when persons ran in opposition to that perception the ruling organizations had of "order". Unfortunately, that order was rather exclusionary. Sorry, but I don't feel "violence" is an appropriate word to describe Hitler's rule in the manner you intend. Perhaps criminal would be a better word or sense to capture - the importation of slave labour kept the economy fed, and the quest for racial purity led to wholesale thievery of personal possessions and property, mass deportations, and eventual mass slaughter. But there were no riots in the streets; the crimes are noted for its near banality. Most victims of the Holocaust gave in to deportation meekly. Some insurrections, ie Sobibor, took place, but violence was far more common in the occupied territories (think French Resistance or Eastern European partisans) than any internal strife in Germany itself. Violence brings to mind all the wrong images when speaking about domestic politics in Nazi Germany. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Dorosh_6aa0.html" title="User:Michael Dorosh">Michael Dorosh</a> 07:05, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am not making a case, I am repeating what are established facts. Copying again <i>(From "Nazi Germany and the Jews" by Saul Friedlander:) "Anti-Jewish violence spread (my note: SPREAD, not BEGUN) after the March elections... In Breslau, Jewish lawyers and judges were assaulted in the court building... in Gedern, the SA (Storm Troopers) broke into Jewish homes and beat up the inhabitants...

<dd>I feel you are making comments based on your personal intuition, and not on any specific knowledge of the subject. The above source material, and there is much more on the subject, justifies the use of the word violence rather than coercion. I'm open to other suggestions, but between violence and coercion the former is a better, more representative word. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 07:40, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Couple of observations: <i>He established a totalitarian regime based on propaganda and violence</i>. This sentence has been changed completely, and it now seems to resemble an attempt to explain the term <a href="../../../t/o/t/Totalitarian_state.html" title="Totalitarian state">totalitarian state</a>. Since we are linking to that article already, it might be better to either use the space for something more useful or abbreviate the intro even further. If you risked a peek at <a href="../../../t/o/t/Totalitarianism.html" title="Totalitarianism">totalitarianism</a>, you'd notice the terms violence and coercion are not mentioned there at all. Instead the the term <i>terror</i> is used, which has not found a lot of support here.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Since the question has been raised before: I believe Hitler's leadership deserves more credit than is implied. I'm quite certain that he was personally responsible for supporting and promoting rapid development of motorized infantry and tank units, which turned out to be a significant tactical advantage at the outbreak of the war. Other examples of projects far ahead of their time are the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autobahn.html" title="Autobahn">autobahn</a> and the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strength_Through_Joy_9b39.html" title="Strength Through Joy">KdF Wagen</a>.

<dd>I don't believe "violence" is POV, but I believe it belongs into the context of his rise to power, say 1930 to 1934, especially if you preface it with "paramilitary" - that was of no great importance after 1934 (with the exception of the Kristallnacht). As to the comparisons above, you didn't see police or paramilitary beating up people as described in Nazi Germany either, after 1934.</dd>
<dd>In the context of Hitler's rule I think coercion is better, as it involves the threat as well as the action, and it also includes the concentration camps (not the Death camps of course).</dd>
<dd>Re the Friedländer quote: he is right but this passage wants to portray the nature of Hitler's state. We cannot include every event in the intro and further down "racial policies" are already mentioned. Also, anti-Jewish violence, as in open violence, was not the mainstay of Nazi Germany until 1938. There was a big lump between the failed boycotts of 1933 and the Kristallnacht.</dd>
<dd>Re 67..., let me say that other Wiki articles are not quotable sources. These other articles might be wrong or missing something. Also, there is no doubt that Hitler is the prime mover behind the military build-up but not behind the economic recovery. And you are overestimating the Autobahn issue - Hitler didn't invent the Autobahn. Plans were already in the drawer and the first German was not opened by Hitler but by his successor Adenauer, who then was mayor of Cologne.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Paramilitary Coercion??</span></h2>
<p>Why not just "paramilitarism"? I think it would cover all the bases and hint at how structured Germany was under the Nazis - from the Hitler Youth to the Reichsbahn, post office, dog catchers and every other official government agency who wore a military uniform complete with dagger and rank insignia. Then you avoid the whole argument over violence/coercion and are free to explain those concepts in detail later, while still hinting at the ways in which Hitler and Nazis gained and maintained power. It is vague and broad enough to include both coercion and violence in the meaning without being exclusive to those concepts.<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Dorosh_6aa0.html" title="User:Michael Dorosh">Michael Dorosh</a> 21:31, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Michael, paramilitarism is far too vague and applies equally well to nations where the paramilitary plays an important but diminished role, such as certain modern East European/ Middle Eastern/ Central Asian countries. I explained this too above. I am fine with the word "terror" as suggested by other editors and used in other articles, though I find it more general and less informative than "violence". -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 21:42, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Michael, the vagueness plays down the brutality of the Nazi regime. As I wrote earlier, I feel editors here would better appreciate the perspective this article needs by reading the accounts of victims of the Holocaust, whether documented by scholars or themselves, rather than glorifying his "talents", to use the word Wyss did. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 21:57, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Given that a stark reference to the 6-11 million people killed in the industrial slaughter of the Holocaust is already in the intro, I hardly think the brutality of the Nazis is being downplayed here.

<dd>I too like the vagueness. Based on Simonides edit history, in effect, it appears he wants the word <i>violence</i> in the intro no matter what. Meanwhile, I have such a docking big problem with using a broad and potentially distracting word like <i>violence</i> in the intro to a serious, high traffic, sensitive encyclopedia article, that I've been resisting it. Simonides and I have a polarized disagreement on this and I think we could use continued input from other editors, thanks. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 21:50, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Terror</span></h3>
<p>Although I agree that Mr Hitler used tactics which could be broadly characterized as "terror," without listing his other tactics the use of this term in the intro will only mislead readers. Worse, the modern usage of the term <i>terror</i> implies specific tactics which were not employed by Hitler, thus the term will further mislead some readers (and ruin the article's credibility for others). In my view, using the word <i>terror</i> is even less helpful than using the word <i>violence</i>, although both adjectives could surely be worked into the main text. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 21:59, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't see this modern terror usage you talk about at all. Terror is not Terrorism. Paramilitarism is of course no substitute. --<a href="../../../y/o/o/User%7EYooden_5685.html" title="User:Yooden">Yooden</a>
<dl>
<dd>I noticed&#160;:) Reader interpretations of the word <i>terror</i> will fall in too wide a range of meanings. I'm not sure readers can be expected to draw a distinction between word forms here. Personally, I think the intro is too long. As I mentioned above, the more one tries to list in a simple intro, the probability of well-intentioned but unhelpful, misleading spin creeping in rapidly approaches 1. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 22:02, 3 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I am not sure how to comment on these wild extrapolations - choosing words based on what is <i>assumed</i> to be the <i>full range</i> of meanings of a word, not to mention the patronizing attitude towards <i>readers'</i> comprehension abilities - which one might as well extend to the rest of the article if not Wikipedia. Words should be chosen on their representativeness of a given situation, not on what a faddish journalism want them to be. Speaking of trying to include too much, Wyss' re-insertion of the note on foreign policy is the best example of crowding a header. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 22:19, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Terror is what happened on the streets then. I can think of no better word to describe that, and certainly no shorter one. Since it's only an introduction, perfect clearness cannot be achieved and shouldn't be attempted, or the introduction would proliferate as you describe. --<a href="../../../y/o/o/User%7EYooden_5685.html" title="User:Yooden">Yooden</a></dd>

<dd>You're mistaken, Simonides.

<dd>I have to agree with Wyss - go vague on the introduction and then develop these themes in the detailed articles. Devote a whole page on Violence in Nazi Germany if necessary, but take the loaded words out of the intro. I think additional input is also necessary here given the impasse. Nazi Germany, for all the "violence and terror" it dealt out, could often be a deceptively benign state within, in which mass murderers could refuse to carry out their duties without consequence(see Browning and Goldhagen, for example). I'd definitely like to see additional opinions on this also; so far I feel Wyss has been right on the mark. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Dorosh_6aa0.html" title="User:Michael Dorosh">Michael Dorosh</a> 22:32, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, <i>terror is not terrorism</i> is not always a true statement, it depends on usage. What I'm on about is that you seem to want a strong, sweeping adjective like <i>violence</i> or <i>terror</i> in the intro to the article and I think it's misleading, since for the average German citizen of the 3rd Reich during the 1930s, violence and terror were at the most, rare events. Since these words are linked to how Mr Hitler rose to power and gained the support of millions of Germans, using them is quite misleading. For most Germans, the coming to power of Mr Hitler was not at all about blood, pain and violence (save for memories of the Great War perhaps). Rather, it was about sundry hopes, fears and sometimes, pride (volkish nationalism). <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 22:26, 3 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with Wyss's interpretation of these points, life in Germany itself was relatively benign - for the good Germans.
