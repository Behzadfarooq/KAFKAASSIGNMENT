<p>There is a group of trolls who have been attacking this group from another forum for several years. It would probably be best if this fake term was removed from Wiki all together. Either that or it should be modified to be correct, that is as presenting it as a theory in someone's head. Editted 2.1.07</p>

<p>So you believe this is ACTUAL INFORMATION? It was written by the group that has been attacking all over the internet for the last 5 years and longer. It can sit here I guess, but it's one reason people question the credibility of Wiki. I'm sorry you hate adopted people so much, it's just a bunch of made up insults.

<p>I've come in response to the POV check request. The removal of the "adoptee murderers" was definately a good thing. However, I'm not quite willing to give the article a "pass" stamp yet, given that while the article does into great length discussing the point of view of the advocates of ACS, there is nary a mention of the opposing viewpoint. My recommendation is to devote a little space in the article to discuss why some people think ACS is not a valid syndrome. Good luck! <font style="font-variant: small-caps;">-- <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShinmawa_8829.html" title="User:Shinmawa">ShinmaWa</a><sup>(<a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShinmawa_fb4c.html" title="User talk:Shinmawa">talk</a>)</sup></font> 18:42, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>No such person. Whoever wrote it likely saw a citation for a paper written by David Kirschner and Linda S. Nagel reading "Kirschner, D. &amp; Nagel, L." and screwed it up - I'd fix it, but really it should have a specific citation, and the article needs a lot of work even apart from that - it's not a well-regarded theory AFAIK. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Schizombie</a></p>

<dd>Kirshner D. Nagel noted that adoptees tend to exhibit more anti-social behaviour than non-adoptees.

<dd>I'm uncertain. We should have at least one Journal study that uses it as a variable and giving a clear operational definition in that regard.

<p>I think its because of folks like <a href="../../../l/u/k/Luke_Helder_edda.html" title="Luke Helder">Luke Helder</a> that give Adopted Child Syndrome a chance at becoming a reality.</p>
<p>I am adopted. I have not witnessed anything particular about being adopted that makes me more or less susceptible to a culture of violence or theft- many anarchists who are not adopted are also theives, not to mention there should also be "Son of Cop Syndrome" with similar connotation.</p>

<p>Likewise, it seems this syndrome is similar to Robin Hood complex which is practically the same thing by its symptoms.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Putting this in the article seems like original research to me. Is there a source saying that the two are similar? --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 23:53, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well, if you read the article it pretty much describes the symptoms as violent behavior and theft. If you use set theory to compare the two, the equation best describing the sets of the symptoms is an identity or equality. There is a significant set of symptoms that are found in the intersection of the sets of the symptoms of both syndromes. Thus, you'll note that the symptoms are almost identical. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctor_Octagon_1892.html" title="User:Doctor Octagon">Doctor Octagon</a> 12:41, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
It has something to do with the Government/society playing God, and thus the individual adoptee acts in the same manner, by playing God with society. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctor_Octagon_1892.html" title="User:Doctor Octagon">Doctor Octagon</a> 12:49, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's all well and good, but we need a source for the comparison, other than you. Otherwise, it is original research. Until such time as there is a source, I'm yanking the Robin Hood Complex.</dd>

<p>This is not a recognized "diagnosis" (per DSM IV). However, I suppose it is a "theory" of sorts developed to explain some observed behavior. I have a few comments, some of which I may add the the article.</p>
<ol>
<li>Children adopted before the age of six-months fare no differently than children raised from birth or raised by birth-parents (Brodzinsky &amp; Brodzinsky, On Adoption).</li>
<li>The generally accepted cause for the higher rates of mental illness and anti-social behavior among adoptees is that they have experieced <a href="../../../c/o/m/Complex_post-traumatic_stress_disorder.html" title="Complex post-traumatic stress disorder">Complex post-traumatic stress disorder</a> and have significant disorder of attachment (see <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attachment_Theory_ebc1.html" title="Attachment Theory">Attachment Theory</a>).

</dl>
<p>In 1992, there were 127,441 children adopted in the United States. (Flango and Flango, 1994)</p>
<p>In the 1990s, there are approximately 120,000 adoptions of children each year. This number has remained fairly constant in the 1990s, and is still relatively proportionate to population size in the U.S. (Flango and Flango, 1994)</p>
<pre>
 New York  104,000 children were adopted in 1986, 53,000 of whom were related adoptions and 51,000 of whom were unrelated. In addition, approximately 10,000 children were adopted from abroad, bringing the total number of unrelated adoptions to 61,000. (Bachrach, London, Maza, 1991)
</pre>
<p>The estimated total number of adoptions has ranged from a low of 50,000 in 1944 to a high of 175,000 in 1970. (Maza, 1994) The number of adoptions by unrelated petitioners declined from a high of 89,200 in 1970 to 47,700 in 1975, while the number of adoptions by related petitioners remained constant between 81,000 and 89,000 during this period. (Maza, 1984)</p>
<p>The National Center for State Courts, Court Statistics Project, has released detailed adoption statistics for the decade 1985 to 1995, and the years 1988 to 1997. The statistics are available for 29 states only and only include data collected from State courts, and are presented in these areas:</p>
<p>Public: Children in the public child welfare system are placed in permanent homes by public, government-operated agencies, or by private agencies contracted by a public agency to place waiting children. In 1992, 15.5% of adoptions (19,753) were public agency adoptions. (Flango and Flango, 1994)</p>
<p>Between 1951 and 1975 the percentage of adoptive placements by public agencies more than doubled from 18% in 1951 to 38% in 1975 (Maza, 1984), and has since fallen to approximately 15% to 20% of all adoptions. (Flango and Flango, 1994)</p>
<p>Private: In a private agency adoption, children are placed in non-relative homes through the services of a non-profit or for-profit agency which may be licensed by the State in which it operates. In an independent or non-agency adoption, children are placed in non-relative homes directly by the birthparents or through the services of one of the following: a licensed or unlicensed facilitator, certified medical doctor, member of the clergy, or attorney. There were 47,627 adoptions (37.5%) of this type in 1992. (Flango and Flango, 1994)</p>
<p>The highest percentage of adoptions completed by private agencies was 45% in 1970. Between 1951 and 1975, the percentage of adoptive placements not made under agency auspices declined substantially from 53% of all adoptions in 1951 to 23% of all adoptions in 1975. The lowest percentage was in 1971 and 1972 when independent adoptions constituted only 21% of all reported adoptions. (Maza, 1984)</p>
<p>Kinship: Children are placed in relatives' homes, with or without the services of a public agency.</p>
<p>Stepparent: Children are adopted by the spouse of one birth parent.</p>
<p>Of adoptions in 1992, the plurality (53,525, or 42%) were either kinship or stepparent adoptions. (Flango and Flango, 1994)</p>
<p>The proportion of adoptions by related individuals steadily increased from 1944 to 1975 until they constituted over 60% of all adoptions. Since almost all adoptions by related petitioners are handled independently, it is likely that by the 1970's a substantial proportion of independent adoptions were by related petitioners. (Maza, 1984) The late 1980s and 1990s showed dramatic increases in kinship placements in public agency adoptions as children entering foster care were placed in the homes of relatives, and these placements were finalized as kinship adoptions.</p>
<p>Transracial: Children are placed with an adoptive family of another race. While these placements may be made by either a public or private agency, or may be independent, the term usually refers to the adoption of a child through the public child welfare system. The most recent estimates, which include intercountry adoptions, found that 8% of adoptions were transracial. (Stolley, 1993)</p>
<p>Intercountry/International: Children who are citizens of a foreign nation are adopted by U.S. families and brought to the United States. This area of adoption has been practiced since the 1950's, but has shown a dramatic increased in the past decade. In 1992, there were 6,536(5%)international adoptees brought to the United States; in 1997, that number increased to 13,620. (United States Department of State)</p>
<p>States with the highest number of adoptions are states with greater populations. In 1992, California lead with 14,722 adoptions. New York was second with 9,570, Texas third with 8,235, Florida fourth with 6,839, and Illinois fifth with 6,599 adoptions. (Flango and Flango, 1994)</p>
<p>It is estimated that about 1 million children in the United States live with adoptive parents, and that between 2% to 4% of American families include an adopted child. (Stolley, 1993)</p>
<p>The majority of Americans are personally affected by adoption. In 1997, the Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute conducted a benchmark survey of 1,554 adults to examine public attitudes toward the institution of adoption and members of the adoption triad. The survey found that 6 in 10 Americans have had personal experience with adoption, meaning that they themselves, a family member, or a close friend was adopted, had adopted a child, or had placed a child for adoption. (Evan B. Donaldson Institute, 1997)</p>

<p>It was discussed - or at least an opinion on it was expressed, several weeks ago, and noone else commented till yesterday. See the section directly above this one?

<p>I have removed the Nancy Verrier section as she does NOT use the term "Adopted child syndrome". Additionally, I am removing the sources cited in the above sections that do not discuss "Adopted child syndrom" per <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>: "the only way to demonstrate that you are not doing original research is to cite reliable sources that provide information <b>directly related</b> to the topic of the article, and to adhere to what those sources say." Essentially, prior to my edits, the article said: "Jones says the Sears Tower is too tall. Smith says that buildings that are too tall run the risk of..." In an article about the Sears Tower, the first sentence is OK (if sourced), the second is not. Prior to my edits, the article talked about several problems adopted children supposedly face, but did not <b>directly relate</b> them to "Adopted child syndrome". <a href="../../../m/d/b/User%7EMdbrownmsw_9056.html" title="User:Mdbrownmsw">Mdbrownmsw</a> 18:03, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Lifton's listed books use the term "Adopted child syndrome" 6 times, as a small piece of her larger discussion and ALWAYS in relationship to David Kirschner. While her views on open adoption and a possible reason for her negative views of adoption are interesting, they are not <b>directly related</b> to Adoped child syndrome in a reliable source that I can find. As a result, per WP:OR, the text removed does not apply to this article. <a href="../../../m/d/b/User%7EMdbrownmsw_9056.html" title="User:Mdbrownmsw">Mdbrownmsw</a> 18:40, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
