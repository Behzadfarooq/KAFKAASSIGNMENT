<p><tt>moved from posting about other subject</tt> Also, most of the early results from the Amazon search on "Adolph Hitler" either seem to be older books or books not particularly about Hitler. A search for "Adolf Hitler" yields more than 4500 results. A google search on "Adolf Hitler" yields 392,000 results. A search on "Adolph Hitler" gives less than 70,000.

<li><b>53,700 hits for "Adolph Hitler"</b> (google.de). If you think this is wrong, i'm not going to contradict you anymore, because i lack the patience. But is not nonsense and its not a mis-spell.

<ul>
<li>So its not just a German spelling!&#160;:) Muriel
<ul>
<li>It's a not a german spelling at all, as far as I can see. <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecretlondon_1805.html" title="User:Secretlondon">Secretlondon</a> 14:55, Nov 12, 2003 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>53,700 hits for "Adolph Hitler"</b> so, if not german, what? You can always ask andy. I'm just 1/2 german... <a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMuriel_Gottrop_3ed2.html" title="User:Muriel Gottrop">Muriel</a>
<ul>
<li>While in German "ph" is an old spelling for "f" (which gets more and more uncommon nowadays) to all my knowledge Hitler always used "Adolf". I could find many websites spell him with "ph" so a redirect is needed, but AFAIK it is a misspelling. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 15:24, 12 Nov 2003 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So far as I know, the "ph" is sometimes used in German instead of the "f". Especially at the end of words. Thus you sometimes see "Emperor Franz Joseph" rather than "Emperor Franz Josef", and so forth. The "Adolph" spelling, while not normally used, is not, I think, necessarily incorrect. It seems to me that it's a valid alternative spelling, even if rather aesthetically unpleasant. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> 19:45, 12 Nov 2003 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, in German you cannot interchange ph and f. If your name is Adolph, then your name isn't Adolf. If your name was Adolf, you cannot write Adolph. There are some particular words, which can be written both with ph and f (Telegrafie, Telegraphie), but in case of names, you have to be exactly. Hitler's name was Adolf!
<ul>
<li>So, Emperor Franz Josef, or Franz Joseph? I have certainly seen both. And that's a different question from anclicizing the name to "Francis Joseph". <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> 04:09, 13 Nov 2003 (UTC)</li>

<li><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7EReddi_47d8.html" title="User:Reddi">reddi</a> ... just make a note that it is <b>sometimes</b> spelled Adolph Hitler.</li>
<li>Mention it, but not in the introduction. Somewhere towards the end of the article discuss how in English Adolph is a common mispelling. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 03:45, Nov 13, 2003 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Its not exactly a mispelling, AFAIK, it was (for whatever reason) specifically used as an English transliteration -- eventually, people decided that German names didn't need to be modified so heavily. <a href="../../../l/i/r/User%7ELir_4e26.html" title="User:Lir">Lirath Q. Pynnor</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Yes, it's a Wikipedia convention to confirm that you've landed at the right page and to mention regularly used alternative meanings near the start of the article so people know that they have arrived at the right place. We're a descriptive work, not a prescriptive one. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesDay_889b.html" title="User:JamesDay">JamesDay</a> 09:07, 14 Nov 2003 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yes, a note on the other spelling isn't a bad idea.<a href="../../../1/6/8/User%7E168....html" title="User:168...">168...</a> 22:37, 14 Nov 2003 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>If you are checking _german_ websites in google, Adolf has 37.500 hits, Adolph only 178. I think Adolph is a misspelling. - <a href="../../../8/2/2E/User%7E82.82.117.83.html" title="User:82.82.117.83">user:82.82.117.83</a></li>
<li>I personally can't stand the other spelling of Adolf. Let's not just follow Brittanica on this issue, as we try to be better than them elsewise. --<a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZanimum_8561.html" title="User:Zanimum">user:zanimum</a></li>
<li>Including the wrong spelling in the introduction makes the incorrect spelling appear equally valid, which it is not -- it is simply wrong.<a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaximus_Rex_f7db.html" title="User:Maximus Rex">Maximus Rex</a> 14:44, 12 Nov 2003 (UTC)</li>
<li>Adolph is wrong. I guess it's an anglicisation, although I've never seen it in the books I've read. Maybe a US thing? <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecretlondon_1805.html" title="User:Secretlondon">Secretlondon</a> 14:49, Nov 12, 2003 (UTC)</li>
<li>Adolph is definitely a misspelling. All German -ph hits are amateurish websites, while the -f hits include reliable sources. "Adolph" may be a redirect to the correct spelling, but the incorrect spelling should not be mentioned in the introduction. -- <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBaldhur_abd2.html" title="User:Baldhur">Baldhur</a> 15:50, 12 Nov 2003 (UTC)</li>
<li>His name only had one spelling, the one in his passport. Everything else can be redirects, but nothing more. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a> 19:53, 12 Nov 2003 (UTC)</li>
<li>Just spell it the way he himself wrote it. --<a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnoyes_3ec6.html" title="User:Snoyes">snoyes</a> 20:01, 12 Nov 2003 (UTC)</li>
<li>It is properly "Adolf" even in English, so it should be spelled that way. This is kind of like <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilhelm_II_of_Germany_a896.html" title="Wilhelm II of Germany">Wilhelm II of Germany</a>, which is not William (although there is <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_William_II_of_Prussia_2704.html" title="Frederick William II of Prussia">Frederick William II of Prussia</a>, for example, not Friedrich Wilhelm). But "Adolph" can redirect here because it is such a common misspelling. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Bishop_face.html" title="User:Adam Bishop">Adam Bishop</a> 20:08, 12 Nov 2003 (UTC)</li>
<li>The modern common spelling is Adolf, Adolph is just a hangover from an older english spelling (it was used first AFAIK in the New York Times Nov 9 1923). --<a href="../../../i/m/r/User%7EImran_5e2c.html" title="User:Imran">Imran</a></li>
<li>A redirect is enough.<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">—Eloquence</a> 13:16, Nov 13, 2003 (UTC)</li>
<li>I second that. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoriori_1969.html" title="User:Moriori">Moriori</a> 01:53, Nov 16, 2003 (UTC)</li>
<li>Adolf himself called himself "Adolf", I think de Fuher's opinion should count as another user's. Not that I'm supporting him in general, just his opinion of his name. Okay? <a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZanimum_8561.html" title="User:Zanimum">Zanimum</a></li>
<li>OK I'll save space...I completly agree with the guy '<a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZanimum_8561.html" title="User:Zanimum">Zanimum</a>' you are sooooo right. We should respect the fact that he wants his name spelt like that. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnips_d67a.html" title="User:Turnips">User:Turnips</a></li>

<p>The name 'Adolf' is from 'Adolphus'. This has a 'ph' because it's Greek, and the Romans transcribed <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">&amp;#966</span>; as 'ph' because it was said [p_h] (aspirated 'p'). The Romans didn't have [p_h] so they mostly said [f]. The Germans and Englsih did the same when they started using the name 'Adolph', but kept the old 'ph' spelling. In the 19th century they sorted out German spelling making it more phonemic, replacing 'c's 'z's and 'k's (e.g. 'circus'-&gt;'zirkus') and 'ph's to 'f's. Some people's names didn;t change though, as didn't soem words, so the 'ph' spelling lingered on - probably why you get 'Joseph' is German. <a href="../../../x/i/p/User%7EXipirho_2f16.html" title="User:Xipirho">Xipirho</a> 23:05, 1 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>There seems to be some confusion among some of the arguments here. I don't think anybody has proposed to move the page to <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolph_Hitler_82be.html" title="Adolph Hitler">Adolph Hitler</a>. Rather, it has been suggested to have, in the introduction, something saying <b>Adolf Hitler</b> (occasionally <b>Adolph</b>), or the like. Since it is, occasionally, spelled "Adolph" in English (and even more occasionally in German, seemingly), I don't see what's particularly offensive about this. In any event, in order to avoid this nasty argument, I propose that we move the page to Adolphus Hitler.

<dd>There is a fundamental difference between a misspelling and an alternative spelling or transliteration. Misspellings should be addressed using redirects and not mentioned in the article itself -- <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_7e69.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not</a> a dictionary. Alternative spellings can be noted, but we should not elevate misspellings to the status of alternative spellings. If "Adoplh" ever <i>was</i> an alternative spelling in academia (it certainly isn't today), that can be noted somewhere long after genocide, war, and his love of dogs.<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">—Eloquence</a> 13:40, Nov 13, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Do we have a final tally? Is everybody happy with where their votes stand? We're reverting back and forth between a version that notes "Adolph" as an incorrect spelling and one that makes no mention of it. The "incorrect" note strikes me as something that most "no" voters wouldn't object to, although at least user Wik (who argues simply that a "misspelling" isn't worth noting) seems adamantly opposed, so I don't know. What do others think about this specific proposition? <a href="../../../1/6/8/User%7E168....html" title="User:168...">168...</a> 22:37, 14 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Wik is just plain wrong on his characterisation of the Adolph Hitler spelling. If I write "Adolf Jitler", that is a mispelling. But "Adolph Hitler" is not a mispelling, it is an incorrect but common alternative spelling. It arose because many classically educated people used to feel that the Greek "ph" is somehow superior to the simple "f", even in a pure Germanic name like Adolf. Even some Germans preferred this, as Wik himself demonstrated when he showed that Goebbels spelled his name "Joseph" rather than "Josef." The article should simply note that the alternative spelling exists but is incorrect, and move on to something more important. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 02:11, 15 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are wrong. Goebbels spelled his name Joseph because that was his name as much as Hitler's was Adolf. Other people may well be named Josef or Adolph. German names can occur in various spellings, but it is fixed for each individual. And it is not up to other people to define alternative spellings. I have to remind you that you were wrong before when you claimed that Goebbels somehow changed his spelling in 1933 from Joseph to the supposedly more Germanic Josef - now you seem to claim the opposite. --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWik_19d3.html" title="User:Wik">Wik</a> 16:00, Nov 15, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Actually, it is indeed "up to other people to define alternative spellings" when the original name is spelled in another alphabet, like Chinese or Arabic. So we have Peking and Bejing and Mecca and Makkah, etc. Typographically, there's nothing standing in the way of us English speakers writing "Deutschland" and yet many of us choose to spell it "Germany."<a href="../../../1/6/8/User%7E168....html" title="User:168...">168...</a> 17:00, 15 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>But German isn't using another alphabet, other than a few special letters which however don't occur in "Adolf Hitler". And "Deutschland" and "Germany" are words in different languages, not just different spellings of the same word. However, modern names (except some royalty) aren't translated like countries. Also, the claim that "Adolph Hitler" is somehow an English specialty is completely wrong; you'll find this misspelling on German sites too, just a bit less frequently because naturally Germans are more familiar with the correct spelling. --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWik_19d3.html" title="User:Wik">Wik</a> 17:22, Nov 15, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The fact of misspelling is not evidence one way or the other about legitimate spellings. While English publishers use both spellings, German publishers only use "Adolf":</p>

<p>I doubt "Adolph" and "Adolf" count as "modern names." Surely they must go back a few centuries, and so it wouldn't be surprising if countries had favorite renderings, like "Adolfo" and so occasionally used <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=es&amp;edition=es&amp;q=adolfo+hitler&amp;btnG=Buscar+en+News" class="external text" title="http://news.google.com/news?hl=es&amp;edition=es&amp;q=adolfo+hitler&amp;btnG=Buscar+en+News" rel="nofollow">"Adolfo Hitler"</a> (46 hits in Spanish media). You might be right that the modern convention is to spell names as their owners did when you use the same alphabet. And yet either that wasn't always the convention or else it wasn't a universal convention, because it's just a fact that some professional writers and publishers in the English speaking world used and continue use "Adolph" to refer to Hitler. <a href="../../../1/6/8/User%7E168....html" title="User:168...">168...</a> 18:56, 15 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This may be shocking, but professional writers and publishers commit misspellings too. With "modern names" I meant names of modern people, who have all kinds of official documents with a fixed spelling of their name. That was different a few centuries ago, but not in Hitler's time. Those who use Adolph do so out of sheer ignorance, not as a conscious "translation" of Adolf. As I said, Germans are much more familiar with the name so German books are much less likely to have this misspelling. --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWik_19d3.html" title="User:Wik">Wik</a> 20:08, Nov 15, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>English people have had spellings written down in dictionaries for centuries and yet dictionaries have had to evolve as the way people choose to spell has drifted.

<p>I don't think it matters whether it was by someone's expert linguistic analysis or by an epileptic seizure that "Adolph Hitler" became common in English publishing. If it was a mistake, that's unfortunate, but mistakes happen and affect the course of history. As I argued, the above note does not actually encourage perpetuation of what you are calling a mistake, it merely notes that it happened and the amount of influence that it has had.

<li>in English today Adolf is used, even though in the very beginning, before Hitler became Nazi Germany's dictator, the New York Times or whoever spelled it Adolph, but later Adolf. If you want to, you can mention it, but not in the introduction, because it is just a misspelling.</li>
<li>in German names ph cannot be interchanged by f.</li>

<p>All these arguments are repeated and repeated and the misspelling still is a misspelling. maybe it is mentionable, maybe it is absolutely unimportant because today in English nobody spells Adolph and it has no historical relevance, because Hitler never used Adolph, it was not his name. 82.82.131.134 01:10, 16 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah. If Adolf friggin' Hitler spelt his name Adolf, I the de Fuher himself just settled it for us. - <a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZanimum_8561.html" title="User:Zanimum">user:zanimum</a></dd>

<dd>Occasionally sometimes... well, if you think that's relevant. But 1) it's still a misspelling and therefore "rendered" should be "misspelled", and 2) it's not true that in Germany Adolf is used "exclusively" - it is just misspelled less frequently, for obvious reasons. --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWik_19d3.html" title="User:Wik">Wik</a> 02:57, Nov 16, 2003 (UTC)

<dd>1)"rendered" is accurate and neutral. "misspelled" would add no information to the paragraph in question (which says how Hitler, the rest of the world and how people writing in English other than in occasional instances spell it), only a value judgement reflecting your POV but not the POV of others here 2) zero hits on German Amazon and zero hits on German Google News means zero usage of "Adolph" in Germany to me. I don't think we care so much about how 17 year-old Berlin bloggers spell it. Seeing as you find even the New York Review of Books an untrustworthy source for accepted word usage, I would have thought that a search restricted to German book titles and newspapers would have been quite wide enough for you. <a href="../../../1/6/8/User%7E168....html" title="User:168...">168...</a> 03:33, 16 Nov 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A misspelling is a misspelling. It makes no difference whether it's a 17-year-old Berlin blogger or the New York Review of Books saying Adolph - neither has the authority to redefine the spelling. If I'm reading the poll right, the majority here supports my view that a redirect is enough. But I don't want to belabour this any further. While you're at it, you might want to go to <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">Fascism</a> and add a note "occasionally rendered <a href="http://mondediplo.com/2002/02/01berlusconi" class="external text" title="http://mondediplo.com/2002/02/01berlusconi" rel="nofollow">Facism</a>". --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWik_19d3.html" title="User:Wik">Wik</a> 03:49, Nov 16, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You don't have the authority to define the spelling either. Anyway, I believe the proposed note is written in such a way that a reader will not fail to conclude that "Adolph" is misspelled, if he or she shares your concept of what constitutes a misspelling. Meanwhile, it's hard to know what to conclude from the poll at this point. Most "no" votes predate my posting of additional evidence and my suggestion we change the question to being about whether "Adolph" is worth a mention at the end. <a href="../../../1/6/8/User%7E168....html" title="User:168...">168...</a> 04:04, 16 Nov 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If, hypothetically, everyone in English starts writing it "Adolph," would it still be wrong?

<p>Although I find this amazing, what we seem to be discussing is</p>
<ul>
<li>a)whether people who do not dispute the accuracy of a footnote but who find it uninteresting should be allowed to require that it not appear in the article, despite the opinions of others who think it deserves inclusion as a footnote</li>
</ul>
<p>and</p>
<ul>
<li>b)whether people who have one of two popular philosophies about spelling (prescriptive versus descriptive) should be allowed to require that the facts in the footnote should be not merely presented but should in addition be interpreted through the lens of their philosophy as indicating a misspelling, even though other people here interpret them as showing the complete opposite.<a href="../../../1/6/8/User%7E168....html" title="User:168...">168...</a> 06:23, 16 Nov 2003 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Whoops: Actually Wik did dispute the accuracy of "exclusively", but I'm sure that a small tweak could make the assertion unambiguously accurate to all interpretation. e.g. "more or less exclusively" or "in publishing....more or less exclusively" etc <a href="../../../1/6/8/User%7E168....html" title="User:168...">168...</a> 06:40, 16 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>I tried to organize everything in a way that was NPOV, I hope no one noticed I found it a hopelessly long discussion *very big smile* . If you didn't, I must have done it in a NPOV way. BTW I could have added much more headings but as it seems everyone finally agreed I didn't think it was that important. PHEW Done, hopefully. Hmm maybe I'm too perfectionist, but well I don't seem to be the only person here&#160;:-P <a href="../../../l/a/u/User%7ELaudaka_0045.html" title="User:Laudaka">Laudaka</a> 07:09, 27 Jan 2004 (UTC) (Paul/laudaka)</p>
