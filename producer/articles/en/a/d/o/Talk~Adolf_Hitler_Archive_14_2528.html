AH as much as anyone suggests that charisma, like so many other human qualities, is in itself but a characteristic... what one does with one's talents is ultimately much more important. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 13:18, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>KEEP</b>. The FACT that Hitler's leadership was very charismatic is VITALLY IMPORTANT to his ability to take over Germany, defy the Versailles Treaty and get away with it, and push anti-Semitism onto a people to such a degree that it is legally enforced, taught in schools, and millions of murders are commited for it. Mein Kampf is horribly written. It is dry, boring, asinine, and unreadable, but it says the SAME THING as his speeches. The difference was his charisma, which doesn't, of course, come out in print. It is in no way synonymous with "he was a good leader" or "what he did was right." If you still have problems with assigning any connotatively positive attitudes with H17LER DA KILL3R OF DA JOOz OMG then watch a video of one of his speeches on the internet. It doesn't matter what he says: the style is grand, he says what the people want to hear, and everyone cheers their head off. Hitler's subjects found him very charismatic. It is a FACT and not in any way anyone's point of view in any manner. 'Charismatic leadership' was the best way of saying it, makes the most sense, and is accurate, factual, and 100% related to Hitler as a dictator and to this article. Definitely keep the charisma in. I can agree that it might not be the best spot for it. But for the love of god the article is like 20 pages. The person who added it was too lazy to read the whole thing and I understand the sentiment. If you don't want the charisma there, read through the article and find a better spot if you want, or close your eyes and pick a place at random if you prefer, but it's definitely necessary somewhere. --68.148.168.84 03:16, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why are we all so interested? Because Hitler masterminded and inspired the most destructive war and despicable genocide in the whole of human history, and ALL humans are fascinated (drawn towards yet also repulsed) by the ultra-dark side of humanity; this much is a fact. War (especially on the scale of WWII) is about as dark as you can get. Plus, it was relatively recently that the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> and <a href="../../../w/w/i/WWII_688e.html" title="WWII">WWII</a> happened, so the memories are still quite fresh in the wounded <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collective_unconscious.html" title="Collective unconscious">collective unconscious</a> of the West, not to mention that many WWII-vets are still alive along with CC-camp survivors, ex-Nazis, etc. I don't care how "cultured" or "refined" you are or claim to be...Hitler's power and darkness will really make you think and his destructive "<a href="../../../c/h/a/Charisma.html" title="Charisma">charisma</a>" still holds sway today around the globe. WWII shaped the modern World as we know it today more than anything else that I can think of. Just imagine the scars that the Germans still hold, the guilt and shame. I’ve always believed that if a person wants to try and understand the 20th Century in the West he/she better try and understand German culture and Germany’s history. Thus, Hitler and his twisted legacy unfortunately lives on and will for a VERY long time to come. --<a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerlin_Stark_0278.html" title="User:Berlin Stark">Berlin Stark</a> 07:43, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I have never claimed to be cultured or refined. Why aren't we as interested in Stalin, who (by body count/ideology) was more deadly/influential than Hitler?

<dd>In the long run Stalin was more deadly than Hitler.... But only in the long run... If you know what was the cost in human lives of the WWII (The Great Patriotic War) for the USSR, what was the destiny of the Slavs in Hitler's mind and how great was their courage during the war. There are some reasons to think that they found Stalin's dictatorship very mild in comparison... More serioulsly "Uncle Adolf" wasn't only the worse criminals of all times... He was was also self-destructive and worse of of all he wished to bring all Germany in his self-destructive project...</dd>

Estimates range as high as 30 million! That's no joke! But of course the flu-pandemic of 1918-19 killed around 50 million, which is the same amount that was said to die in all of WWII; it's all really hard to follow with all of these "estimates" floating about. 152.15.100.163 22:46, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No doubting the courage of Russian resistance to Barbarossa, but why didn't the same people have the courage to see what Stalin was about? The people of western Ukraine know all about the long run, because at one point a large proportion found themselves dead at Stalin's command. If you say,"<i>comparatively mild</i>" then you must be mad. As for the interest in Hitler, I guess it is partly generated by the soap opera aspects of both his life and the rise of the National Socialist party.

<dd>It may depend on which end of the gun you're looking at, but gunpowder explodes and that's it - no mystery. Apologies for the "<i>mad</i>" query. The "<i>soap opera</i>" description relates to aspects such as the Geli Raubel relationship, the bad art, vegeterianism, drug taking, the jolly sympathy with children, the fatal attraction over women, the marriage to Eva Braun, etc -the kind that inflame vulgar fantasies. The question stands: why the blanket interest in Hitler, when Stalin merits as much, if not more?

<p><b>Delete</b>: the problem isn't so much the meaning of the term itself, but its placement in the article and its connotation. If we want a reference in the introduction to Hitler's personal charisma, it would be clearer to say that he was a gifted orator (if that's specifically what we are referring to.) As it is, we have a poorly explained reference which links to an article on a theory by Weber, which just doesn't belong in the introduction. To boot, a good proportion of readers will take this as an endorsement of Hitler, again because the meaning is overly vague. It's a mess. Moshe is correct that this needs to be moved.

<p><b>STRONG KEEP</b>: All the DELETE votes betray an anxiety about describing Hitler for the man he was.

<p><b>Keep:</b> Anyone who wants to eliminate the "charisma" lines either doesn't understand "charisma" or rightly wants clarified context- mention does need to be made that his power came from his charisma (if it isn't) and this needs to clearly lead into his "charismatic leadership". There is ABSOLUTELY NO QUESTION as to whether or not his leadership came from his charisma- everyone in the world at the time saw his ability as an orator and propaganda centerpiece. Seperating Hitler from his charismatic powers would be like trying to cover (not trying to make any associations here) Mother Theresa or Ghandi without mentioning religion. It's not only signifigant, it's absolutely inseperable. [Eh, account probs. No vote if it's a prob.]</p>
<p><b>STRONG KEEP:</b> Blowfish - This has absolutely nothing to do with connotation. This is not a childrens book. The WikiCommunity should be interested only in denotation and as it has already been clearly stated the denotation of charismatic pinpoints AH's quality. Charisma is only subjective when there is doubt, however in this case there is none. AH could not have delivered so much destruction and that pace without convincing the public that it was justified. It was his presence and passionate oratory. That sold evil. Find me one academic historian who would not explain Hitler's charismatic nature as one of the top reasons he was near-universally accepted in Germany. Explaining it in any other way is concealing the truth. The truth that is accepted by all who value it.<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMask_b14b.html" title="User:Mask">User:Mask</a> 17:36 30 November 2005</p>
<p><b>MUST KEEP:</b> W'pedia shouldn't be dumbing down things so they're palatable to the average person. "Charisma" has a very specific (not vague), value-nuetral definition that applies nowhere if it can't be applied to Hitler. Charisma isn't the ability to be popular-anyone can jump in front of a parade-its a leader's ability to make people want to changes their lives to live according to the leader's vision. George Washington, JFK and Reagan were popular. Jesus, Martin Luther, Martin Luther King, Marx, Gandi, and unfortunately Hitler where charismatic.66.189.168.107 19:44, 2 December 2005 (UTC)BoomBox 18:25, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Keep</b>&#160;: I personally hate Hitler more than any other person in history, but I don't think he could have succeeded if he wasn't "charismatic". Blowfish says it's better to say he was a "gifted orator" - this is much more "positive" than "charismatic" - Satan himself was charismatic - one of my heroes, Martin Luther King was charismatic - so this illustrates Boombox's point - "charismatic" is neither positive or negative. And anyway, who says Hitler was a "gifted orator"? Only if you think that mad ranting, lies and slander makes for "gifted" oratory.<br />
As for Andries "several historians and psychologists..." this sounds like weasel words (although you do give refs). The german people didn't need historians or psychologists to tell them that Hitler was "charismatic". If Satan was to arrive tomorrow, you can be sure that many people would be seduced by his charisma - except of course, there's no such thing as Satan...</p>

<p><b>KEEP WITH A TWIST</b> - his personal charisma was underwhelming. It may do well to point that out. In public, he was mesmerizing; his staff suffered for years from listening to the SAME rants and opinions at the dinner table, as well as from his severe halitosis. It was apparently not pleasant to be in the same room with him, and when his staff moved to Rastenburg, with the summer heat and the midges flying about, it was almost more than they could take. Publicly, very charismatic, but apparently someone exasperating to have to live with. Being a nightowl, he also stayed up to all hours engaging his staff in the same conversations over and over again. Having said all that, it should be a footnote somewhere - the article as is is fine - saying he was charismatic does not imply support for him. But perhaps change it to "publicly charismatic" - that is what leaders do, and implies less support for him on a personal level. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Dorosh_6aa0.html" title="User:Michael Dorosh">Michael Dorosh</a> 17:47, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>RPlunk, no one can be excommunicated post mortem. However, the Church can declare that someone dead had incurred excommunication while alive (there are action that will get oneself automatically excommunicated). In regard to living persons, excommunication is pronounced primarily for the benefit of the excommunicated, to indicate to him the wrongness of his ways and make him repent and turn back. (Of course this only works, if the person in question is touched by such a move - in regard to earthly rulers it worked with Emperor Henry IV, but not with Elizabeth of England or Napoleon. It would have worked less with Hitler.) The secondary reason is the benefit of other people, to warn them not to take someone as an example or to head his teaching (the latter in regard to theologians). In the case of someone dead, the primary reason falls away, since a dead person cannot repent and turn back. The secondary reason is still valid, but the question is whether this should be done - is anyone seriously in doubt about the relation between Hitler and Christianity. If so, education is needed and such a declaration of excommunication might play a role in that. But I doubt that this is the case. A mere symbolic excommunication (which I guess you mean by atonement) I don't right. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 21:20, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Excommunication does not need to be declared by the church.

<dd>Mmg, thanks for your further clarification. That's what I meant by "the Church can declare that someone dead had incurred excommunication while alive (there are action that will get oneself automatically excommunicated)" and I guess apostasy is only the tip of the ice-berg of things that will automatically excommunicate someone - but I agree that Hitler is guilty of that (and many other things - he surely scores 7 out of 7). <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 18:04, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In any case, excommunication is not an act of ultimate condemnation, as seems to commonly be believed, rather it is simply the formal exclusion of someone from the community of the Catholic Church for theologically-oriented offenses such as desecrating the Eucharist, propagating anti-Catholic theological beliefs, violating the sanctity of the Vatican, and so on. It is not leveled against someone merely for not following the dictates of the Church, no matter how radically the person deviates (unless the person assaults the Church directly, although I suppose that was the case insofar as many priests, especially Polish ones, died in the Holocaust [but it would *not*, as far as I can tell, apply to the killing of the Jews, which often seems to be rationale given]).--Critic9328 16:05, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Hans, I think the current photo, the one you call propaganda, is better. Yes, it is an official photo and yes, it is aimed at portraying AH in a certain way, but this photo can also help to include into this article this way of "self-potrayal" or self-image. I don't think it's right to insist on AH looking bad on photos. There are other photos included to counter this and the article's text also should be more than enough to dispell any admiration for the man, except for those already lost. As for the "cult figure" category, I agree - the problem is not, that AH is not a cult figure for some people (not only Nazis), but I think the category is nonsensical - when properly applied it'd make a very big category. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 20:40, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In the end, the picture for Hitler is the perfect ones (IMHO). When someone thinks of Hitler, they think of the man in the uniform (and his atrocities, but that gets into NPOV). If you wanted a shot of Michael Jordan, you'd get the one famous shot of him dunking the ball with his tongue sticking out- it's the most iconic representation of him that's ever been made. You don't look for a picture of him in casual clothing posing for a family photo- that's not "him". For nearly all major dictators, the shot that most people associate with the person is the classic military shot of them in full uniform. The only other shot that matches the one in place would be one of Hitler opening the Olympic games- and I think most people would take even more offense to that one. And in case it hasn't been said, looking for a photo "to show how creepy he was" is completely NPOV, and that doesn't belong here.</dd>

<p>The first photo in Polish Wikipedia may be acceptable: it's a civilian pose from his twenties. Curiously, their article on Stalin seems to be longer than the one on Hitler. I wonder why?--<a href="../../../s/h/t/User%7EShtove_8f32.html" title="User:Shtove">shtove</a> 23:23, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I’m just a reader of this article but my suggestion to the editors is:</p>
<pre>
why not  1: keep the propaganda picture of AH in his uniform, which is both a stereotypical way of AH being presented to the public as well as a prototypical way of presenting dictators (as has been mentioned above by someone else). 2: disambiguate your intentions etc by making a note that explains that this is actually a propaganda  pic aiming at portraying Hitler as such and such… Andry

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Clarification on Schicklgruber name</span></h2>
<p>From "Early Years":</p>
<dl>
<dd>Alois Hitler was born out of wedlock and used his mother's surname, Schicklgruber, until he was 40. In 1876, he began using the name of his stepfather, Johann Georg Hiedler, after visiting a priest responsible for birth registries and declaring that Georg was his father...</dd>
</dl>
<p>This doesn't make sense to me. He was born in 1889, used Schicklgruber until he was 40, but began using "Hiedler" in 1876? These numbers don't add up. Can someone clarify? 71.139.49.248 03:38, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
