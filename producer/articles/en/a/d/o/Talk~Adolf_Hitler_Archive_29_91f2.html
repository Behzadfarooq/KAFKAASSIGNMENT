<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Small f</span></h2>
<p>This is like with Lacan and the <i>petit a</i> (a silly joke - never mind.)</p>
<ul>
<li>As someone else noted above, Fascism as a state ideology is different from fascism as a set of characteristics that are revealed after the fact, ie after the fascist government in question takes control and does stuff that has little to do with the nominal ideology (democracy, communism, etc). In this sense it is correct to label the Nazis a fascist regime, as was Franco's regime, etc - see Robert Paxton's recent book on the same (<i>Anatomy of Fascism</i>, if I remember the title correctly). However, it is a 'loaded' word that only entered general use after the WW2 period, so I would avoid it if possible. It clearly connotes the Italian regime and since we are talking about the Nazis, who became nearly synonymous with the Fascists in their opposition to the Allies, it's best to avoid any potential confusion for the general reader. In the header the word totalitarian more than serves its purpose.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Totalitarian is not a loaded or connotative word at all. It's like the common words autocratic or despotic or oligarchic - it's a very general word that can be applied to any context that has a certain common set of characteristics (strict censorship, crushing of dissent, etc) - it only becomes loaded in debatable contexts like with the current state of the USA (is the USA now totalitarian or not? Clearly most Americans would disagree though it fits the bill in many ways). However, the totalitarian nature of Nazism has never been disputed seriously.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have edited the paragraph to keep it concise (ex. deaths of 11 million people --&gt; 11 million deaths; it's understood we are talking about people and not flora and fauna) and retain almost every point that (I think) was key before all this other stuff cropped up. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 01:32, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The very conceptual model of the theory of totalitarianism is disputed, which makes it unacceptable in an encyclopedia article unless the term is itself subject to discussion. As an objective label its best avoided for its charged ideological usage, and its failure to provide any meaningful understanding of the nature of the movement it purports to describe other than a superficial identification of features that the labels Nazism and fascism already connote. <a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 01:44, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Simonides, how does making no distinction (in the article) between Nazi totalitarianism and Soviet totalitarianism help to "avoid potential confusion for the general reader"?</dd>
<dd>What is your response to the fact that Wikipedia is currently out of line with both Encarta and Britannica (cited above) in its failure to record, with even a single word, the fact that Hitler's regime was Fascist, or even "fascistic"? While rejecting the term, you yourself give two notable reasons why it should be accepted. <a href="../../../c/p/m/User%7ECPMcE_3017.html" title="User:CPMcE"><i>Camillus</i></a> <a href="../../../c/p/m/User_talk%7ECPMcE_6ecc.html" title="User talk:CPMcE">(talk)</a> 01:48, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The word totalitarianism is very broadly in use and can be applied to almost any state that employs certain methods, without any reference to ideology, which is the whole point of using it in the header - as objective language as possible. There is no confusion with Soviet totalitarianism because it's a word like 'monarchy', describing a state of affairs rather than an ideology (the ideology is sketched with the references to anti-Semitism, nationalism, etc.) As I already stated the word <i>fascist</i> can lead to confusion with <i>Fascism</i> which is a particular ideology rather than a mere state of affairs (like totalitarianism, oligarchy, monarchy etc) though I certainly don't disagree with its applicaton to the Nazis; we are simply trying to inform the general reader here with as much clarity as possible. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 01:55, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You say that you "certainly don't disagree with its application to he Nazis", but in practice, remove any mention of the "fascist" nature of Hitler's ideology from the article, not even just the the introduction. The general reader may well be confused when he goes to Britannica and sees Hitler described squarely as a Fascist, with a capital F, and then comes to Wikipedia, and sees not even a <i>single word</i> mention of the fascistic nature of Hitler's ideology. Any number of reputable books also describe him as such, yet Wikipedia shys away as it may be seen to be "pejorative". Poor Hitler! In Giovannis' word: inexcusable. <a href="../../../c/p/m/User%7ECPMcE_3017.html" title="User:CPMcE"><i>Camillus</i></a> <a href="../../../c/p/m/User_talk%7ECPMcE_6ecc.html" title="User talk:CPMcE">(talk)</a> 02:05, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The good news is that most editors will favor its inclusion in keeping with the majority view and Wikipeadia will be kept up to the high standards of the other non-free encylopedias. And, I disagree with Simonides equating the well accepted descriptions of a <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarchy.html" title="Monarchy">Monarchy</a>, which is form of government in which one person has the hereditary right to rule as head of state during his or her lifetime, with the theory of totalitarnism, which contrary to what he says also involves a description of ideology. In my view, the organic, idealist conception of the State that this theory rests on is deeply flawed. <a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 02:18, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It seems you missed my comments below and are new to this Talk page. As others will attest I am no defender of Hitler and to the best of my knowledge there are no 'camps' on this page. My only concern is for clarity - most Americans didn't even know where Kabul was until the Afghanistan invasion started, so (without meaning to be superior or condescending in any way) I think we are overestimating the understanding of the average individual who does their research online, by relying on their knowledge of modern scholarship to distinguish between fascist and Fascist. As Giovanni himself noted (or was it someone else) and I repeated, the small f word only entered general use after a study of these regimes, which reinforces my point about confusion between ideology and a state of affairs. Totalitarian itself has been around only slightly longer, since about the 20s, and it was a word made popular by the Fascists themselves, but please note that while the word does include the use of ideology it does not connote any <i>specific</i> ideology which puts it in a different category from words like Nazi, Fascist etc. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 02:22, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I presume the above post was directed to me, and not Giovanni? I have never accused you of being a defender of Hitler - far from it! And I have never used the word "camps" - there appears to be a "group" of editors in favour of a mention of the "fascist" nature of Hitler's ideology, and a "group" against such a mention, but I do not believe in cabals, and I don't go "investigating" other editors to see what other edits they have made. I am perfectly aware that people can come from quite disparate viewpoints, and yet agree on particular issues. While I may be new to this talk page, I wasn't born yesterday either&#160;;)</dd>
<dd>I suggested above that it would be helpful to include some mention (even a single word!) of the Fascist/fascist/fascistic nature of Hitler's ideology and wikilink it to the section describing the similarities/differences in the <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">Fascism</a> article. I can't see how this wouldn't help the reader. You yourself say that "totalitarian" does not connote any specific ideology, so how does this help the reader, if we only use it in its non-specific meaning, without any distinction? I have no problem with the use of "totalitarian" in the article, as Hitler's (and Stalin's) regime were the epitome of the term. But can't we make a distinction?</dd>
<dd>Could you please respond to my question regarding how WP is currently out-of-line with Britannica, Encarta and many other reputable sources with its failure to mention, even in passing, Hitler's brand of "fascism"? <a href="../../../c/p/m/User%7ECPMcE_3017.html" title="User:CPMcE"><i>Camillus</i></a> <a href="../../../c/p/m/User_talk%7ECPMcE_6ecc.html" title="User talk:CPMcE">(talk)</a> 02:46, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was addressing both you and Giovanni. Let's make this very simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Totalitarianism has variants, one of which is fascism. Totalitarianism is the 'higher' category however because its usage is broader, and more appropriate over here (explained below).</li>
<li>It is not merely a 'theory' or a 'concept' - it pretty much describes a certain state of affairs or set of methods - basically, <i>total</i> control, ie of every aspect of life. (Although of course there are various theories which are <i>about</i> totalitarianism, or totalitarian in nature, or the products of totalitarian regimes, etc.)</li>
<li>Most readers, and the Wikipedia article itself, don't clearly distinguish between fascism and Fascism. The current wikilink takes us to <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">Fascism</a>, a single article (not two - Fascism vs fascism), which itself makes the word synonymous at some points and comments on differing definitions. I fully acknowledge that fascism in current scholarship has a broader definition than Fascism and includes Nazism, Franco's rule, Pinochet's rule, etc but my only contention is that we want to make things easier for the reader, not tougher. We make it tougher by allowing for the potential confusion between Mussolini's regime and the accepted scholarly usage. The word has not yet reached the point where people can distinguish between the two usages as they might be able to between republican (in the 19th century French usage, for ex.) vs Republican, or democratic and Democrat, etc.</li>
<li>Wikipedia (which I'm highly critical of, btw - you'll see some links to debates on my Talk page) doesn't follow the same standards as other, non-free encyclopediae. It tries to set <i>equally high</i> standards, but not the same ones (which can be very frustrating.)</li>
<li>By not connoting any specific ideology, we make specific reference to Hitler's methods and not just his beliefs. His beliefs/ideology are also mentioned separately in the references to nationalism, anti-Semitism, militarism etc. Basically, we are able to round out a description of Hitler's rule without being redundant (by explaining its various aspects to readers) instead of just sticking the label fascist (which overlaps with stuff that is already stated) and leaving readers to figure out its meaning in this context.</li>
<li>We can certainly make room for explaining the difference between fascism and Fascism later in the article, but IMO it clutters the header which must be brief.</li>
</ul>

<dd>I see Wys is stil pushing her POV. But, I thank Simonides for his efforts, despite that we disagree on the theory of totalitarianism (its really a theory that is highly disputed). I agree with the current version that addresses editorial language, but includes the correct usage of fascism and imperialism, instead of the loaded term, totalitarianism, or the less than satifactory term expansionism. And it doesn't matter if other readers are not aware of the small f, capital F difference--its moot: Nazism is properly termed fascism. I agree with the analysis of Giovanni, John K, and Camilus, and disagree with Str, and most of all, Wyss. <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBelindaGong_bd31.html" title="User:BelindaGong">BelindaGong</a> 04:10, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><strike>Belinda, was there ever an issue you didn't agree on with Giovanni?</strike></p>
<dl>
<dd>Personal attacks are verboten at WP. -- 68.6.73.60 03:08, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Quite in contrast to what he is saying: there is (or was) a debate about whether N. is a form of F. or rather of T. - and there still different views on this. Hence including F. in the intro is POV (agreed, including T. becomes POV as well). At best, both equations are disputed.</p>
<p>Also, "Fascist Totalitarianism" doesn't work as this states the two opposing views. And we don't need to distinguish the two Totalitarisms here, as it is clear in the article that Hitler was a Nazi and no communist.</p>
<p>No one is talking about Hitler without mentioning F., as Mussolini certainly was a model for the early Hitler and later an ally, but whether N. equals F. is another question. And we can quite well talk about Hitler and N. without calling it F. We could include (if it really isn't included) a short phrase about parallels to Italian Fascism in the "early party" section, but it has to be short, as this article is about Hitler the man.</p>
<p><strike>Name-calling doesn't help the discussion either, Giovanni, and</strike> whether F. is seen as a negative (I think we share at least that much) is irrelevant - what Wyss pointed out is the term is used to label all kinds of political views. Nazi is a better term as Hitler actually called himself a Nazi.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Giovanni did not call anyone names. -- 68.6.73.60 03:08, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The preference of many people for labelling N. as F. is motivated in some cases by ideological preference (the so-called Antifascism), in other by linguistical (longish Nationalsocialism, German: Nazismus vs. Narzismus).</p>
<p><b>Last but not least, even if it were undisputed to label N. as F., it still wouldn't be all right to include it into the intro, as the "regime passage" in the intro is not concerned with labelling the political affiliation of Hitler (that is dealt with in the first paragraph by clearly calling him what he was, a Nazi), but the nature of the regime. To say it was F. is absolutely redundant. The whole passage becomes pointless and should better be removed completely.</b></p>
<p><a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 10:27, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>PS. I do understand the F-f distinction but I don't like it, though it is unfortunately a part of the English language, an ugly scar on a beautiful face. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 10:27, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Let me clarify one thing more, echoing Simonides. If T. is used along the line of the theory of T. it is a contentious point, but so would be F. However, when using T. more broadly, as Simonides argued, it is not contentious. F. however always remains redundant and pointless in the "regime passage". But I am open to any alternative word that might do the trick of avoiding the contentious side of T. while including the broader, non-contentious side of T. The problem is that most words are too weak to properly describe N. (e.g. authoritarian, dictatorial). <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 10:33, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't think I understand Simonides's argument that "fascism" is confusing, but that "totalitarianism" is perfectly acceptable. "Totalitarianism" just <i>isn't</i> a neutral, descriptive word. Use of the word means that one is endorsing a particular ideological viewpoint, which states that Nazism and Stalinism are essentially similar. As Str has noted, there are some scholars who hold this viewpoint. But it is very distinctly a minority viewpoint, and it is particularly so among scholars of Nazi Germany - I can't think of any major currently working historians who endorse the totalitarian model. That is to say, totalitarianism is a word which is used by a small minority of scholars and represents commitment to a particular ideological model of what Nazi Germany is. Fascism, on the other hand (with a small "f") is mostly agreed upon by historians as a useful model for understanding various European political movements of the interwar period, and the regimes they established, most notably in Germany and Italy. There are numerous useful scholarly works about the phenomenon of European fascism in the interwar period, and every single one includes Nazi Germany. Some scholars don't like to use the term, but I don't think that fascism studies can be said to represent a single ideological viewpoint in the way that "totalitarianism" does.</p>
<p>In terms of broader meanings, I would dispute that wikipedia should concern itself with that, especially if we are giving a link. If we say "totalitarian," we are going to link to the "totalitarianism" article, which is a particular theory which is mostly rejected among scholars. The popular meaning of the term is simply a derivative of the scholarly theory, and it seems to me that it's impossible to assert a clear decision between the two meanings. With "fascism," on the other hand, I agree that it has become something of a pejorative, and that, if the popular meaning is intended, it could be misleading. Fortunately, though, a link to the <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">fascism</a> article would clarify matters. I would accept, though, if we were to agree to use neither term in the intro, although fascism should certainly be mentioned somewhere in the article. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 16:37, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>And Wyss even now wants to zap the word "totalitarian" as "too loaded"!</p>
<p>Note that the German language Wikipedia adds Hitler to the "Faschismus" category (and incidentally, uses the more neutral photo which has been proposed for this page, rather than the glorifying picture used here.)<br />
Britannica calls Hitler a Fascist (and with a capital F!). Encarta calls him a fascist!<br />
And I'm still waiting for someone to say how Wyss's "preferred" dicdef does not fit Hitler.<br />

<dd>Camillus, it is rather "We want to have 10 for us and you want to have 10 for us so let's give 5 to each." Not saying that works, just pointing out Wyss' reasoning. And, before you ask, this is only about the intro. Adding references to Fascism or Totalitarianism in the article is valid. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 21:17, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps we're getting somewhere - "adding references to Fascism or Totalitarianism in the article is valid". That's promising. I don't see, however, how proposing to remove both ideas is giving something to both sides...you've lost me there...but I'm prepared to draw a line under this as I'm more interested in your proposal that both be mentioned in the article. <a href="../../../c/p/m/User%7ECPMcE_3017.html" title="User:CPMcE"><i>Camillus</i></a> <a href="../../../c/p/m/User_talk%7ECPMcE_6ecc.html" title="User talk:CPMcE">(talk)</a> 21:38, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, we should draw the line. Just a last attempt at explanation. One side wants F. and opposes T., the other side wants T. and opposes F., so leaving out both in the intro would have denied both sides their wish but also spared them to put up with what they didn't want.</dd>
<dd>Sure, I never denied that F. can be mentioned in the article (if I came across as such I am sorry), as in the article he have more space than in the intro. If there is no mentioning yet, this not the result of any conscious decision. The question is where to put it. We could include a reference immediately before the putsch of 1923 (as Mussolini is mentioned anyway) or before that in the early party organisation phase. For another proposal re the intro see John K below. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 21:57, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I did suggest avoiding both <i>fascism</i> (or <i>fascistic</i>) and <i>totalitarian</i> as a compromise and still support that. I'm also ok with the use of the word <i>totalitarian</i> and alternatively, a minimalised intro but the latter is not a popular suggestion here and I'm ok with that too.</p>

<dd>An introduction for Hitler, without mentioning the Holocaust, or the war that Hitler threw the world into, as you propose, <b>will not pass</b>, just as an introduction for Stalin without mentioning the millions of deaths in the Gulags will not pass, or an introduction to Mao without mentioning the madness of the Cultural Revolution will not pass. <a href="../../../c/p/m/User%7ECPMcE_3017.html" title="User:CPMcE"><i>Camillus</i></a> <a href="../../../c/p/m/User_talk%7ECPMcE_6ecc.html" title="User talk:CPMcE">(talk)</a> 17:07, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not only in the intro, but not even a single mention throughout the article? Brittanica is not the only reputable source that characterises Hitler's ideology as fascist.

<dd>Camillus is correct.

<p>No one (AFAI can see) is denying that some elements of Hitler's ideology is fascist, but you probably could make Stalin a Fascist that way.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This is nonsense. No one seriously makes out Stalin to be a fascist in any way similar to how Hitler is infact a fascist. To even make this argument shows a profound ignorance of the use of these terms. No wonder there is confusion here about calling Nazi Germany fascist. I suggest that you don't rely on your own understanding (flawed) but instead refer to the mainstream view on Nazi Germany, which does describe Nazi Germany as fascist. Show me where in the mainstream Stalin is tagged with this term? I bet you won't find anything outside of extreme fringe POV's.<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikaM_b05b.html" title="User:MikaM">MikaM</a> 03:50, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hardly surprising that you "don't agree", but how is it any less accurate than your assertion? We'll ignore the "Stalin was as much a fascist as Hitler", as you say, it's not "scholarly". The idea that Hitler's ideology was not fascistic is a fringe view, and the idea that Stalin was a fascist is a fringe view too. Franco didn't "perfect" Fascism, Hitler developed it into "Super Fascism", ie. Nazism. 16:56, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Happily, there is no need to mention these things in the intro, never mind we have some polite disagreements as to historical perspective, definitions and semantics.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Editorial language</span></h2>
<p>Firstly, I think it's important to make something clear because Talk pages have a tendency to degenerate into camps - there aren't any real 'sides' in this article and I am not on anyone's 'side'. Any newcomer to this Talk page should go through the past five archived pages to realise that I have found previous versions of the header too much of a whitewash and argued at great length and sometimes vehemently with Wyss and to a lesser extent Str1977, Golbez and others - we're no cabal.</p>
<p>That said, words like "ultimately", "aggressively", "at the height of their power" etc are all very editorial, and this is the same concern that is driving some of the other editors to replace 'fascist' with 'totalitarian'; let's please try to use facts when we can as it sounds much more formal and provides more information (ultimately can be replaced with 'eventually' or 'by 19xx', or height of powers can be given an approximate time period, and so on.) -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonides_f33a.html" title="User:Simonides">Simonides</a> 01:42, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'd prefer to keep some of this editorial language, especially "at the height of their power" -it is hardly longer and we don't need to place exact dates into the intro. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 22:10, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sad to say, almost <i>nobody</i> editing WP reads archived talk pages and I've run into admins exercising their admin powers who've actually told me "I'm not going to wade through x pages of archived talk..." The result is constant repetition of the same issues over and over again. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 19:53, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hitler's sexuality - is a side-issue and a diversion from more substantive issues</span></h2>
<p>This Talk page is 145 kB long. I created a sub-page for this "side issue" of Hitler's sexuality, and moved the "discussion" above into it., see: /Hitler's Sexuality. However, Str1977 reverted it. To be frank, I'm pissed off that this stupid speculation has been allowed to get us away from the real issues. I couldn't give "two hoots" if Hitler was gay or not - I'm more concerned with the discussion of the fascist nature of his regime, whether the intro should be expunged of mention of the Holocaust, Hitler's imperialism/aggressive expansionism/"reclaiming of former German lands".</p>
<p>Str1977, pleas don't revert these remarks without discussion. <a href="../../../c/p/m/User%7ECPMcE_3017.html" title="User:CPMcE"><i>Camillus</i></a> <a href="../../../c/p/m/User_talk%7ECPMcE_6ecc.html" title="User talk:CPMcE">(talk)</a> 11:00, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Could you please assume good faith. I certainly will not remove your comments from the talk page. I was merely adding my signature which (via the glitch) restored the section. I will restore your move now, though I don't think the topic merits a page of its own.

<dd>I am sorry if you took my comment as lacking respect for your "good faith". I allowed my annoyance at this "diversion" to spill over. My apologies. I think that the discussion does merit a separate talk page, as I imagine that this will come up again and again - just as there is a separate talk page for Adolf or Adolph, another perennial. <a href="../../../c/p/m/User%7ECPMcE_3017.html" title="User:CPMcE"><i>Camillus</i></a> <a href="../../../c/p/m/User_talk%7ECPMcE_6ecc.html" title="User talk:CPMcE">(talk)</a> 12:07, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And I am sorry for counteracting your move and for overreacting a bit. Last night was quite tense on WP (first this issue, later a sockpuppet controversy) and some of this spilled over to today.
