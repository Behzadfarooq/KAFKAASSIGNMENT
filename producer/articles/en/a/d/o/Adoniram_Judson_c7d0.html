He then attended The <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andover_Theological_Seminary_7b31.html" title="Andover Theological Seminary">Andover Theological Seminary</a>, and graduated in 1810. Two years previous, he had "made a solemn dedication of himself to God". This was followed by a resolve to work as a missionary during the year of his graduation. He had joined an earnest group of mission-minded students at <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andover.html" title="Andover">Andover</a> who called themselves "the Brethren". It was the students there at Andover, not the organizational leadership of the church, who ignited the fire that gave America its first organized missionary society. Passionately eager to serve abroad, and convinced that “<i>Asia with its idolatrous myriads, was the most important field in the world for missionary effort</i>”<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_AFM"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/d/o/Adoniram_Judson_c7d0.html#endnote_AFM" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/d/o/Adoniram_Judson_c7d0.html#endnote_AFM" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></sup></span> and appeared before the Congregation Church’s General Association to appeal for support to their missionary intentions. Impressed by the polite behavior of the 4 men and their sincerity, the elders in 1810 voted to form an “<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Board_of_Commissioners_for_Foreign_Missions_6719.html" title="American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions">American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions</a>”.</p>

<p>On September 19, Judson was appointed by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions as a missionary to the East. Judson was also commissioned by the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congregational_Church_b28b.html" title="Congregational Church">Congregational Church</a>, and soon married <a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Hasseltine_Judson_7551.html" title="Ann Hasseltine Judson">Ann Hasseltine</a> on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_5.html" title="February 5">5 February</a> <a href="../../../1/8/1/1812.html" title="1812">1812</a>. He was ordained the next day at the Tabernacle Church in Salem, and on February 19 set sail aboard the brig "Caravan" with Luther Rice, Samuel Newell and Harriett Newell and his wife, Ann (known as "Nancy") Judson.</p>

Both the local and British authorities did not want Americans evangelizing <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindus.html" title="Hindus">Hindus</a> in the area, so the group of missionaries separated and sought other mission fields. They were ordered out of India by the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_East_India_Company_534d.html" title="British East India Company">British East India Company</a>, to whom American missionaries were even less welcome than British (They were baptized in September, already in June the United States had declared war on England).

<p>After his conversion of views regarding believer baptism, Judson offered to Baptists in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> to serve as their missionary. Luther Rice who had also converted was in poor health and returned to America and his work and William Carey's urgings resulted in the formation in <a href="../../../1/8/1/1814.html" title="1814">1814</a> of the <i>General Convention of the Baptist Denomination in the United States for Foreign Missions</i> (commonly called the <i>Triennial Convention</i>).</p>

<p>It was another difficult year before the Judsons finally reached their originally intended destination, Burma.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_AFM"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/d/o/Adoniram_Judson_c7d0.html#endnote_AFM" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/d/o/Adoniram_Judson_c7d0.html#endnote_AFM" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></sup></span> Buddhist Burma, Judson was told by the Serampore Baptists, was impermeable to Christian evangelism. Judson, who already knew Latin, Greek and Hebrew, spent over three years learning to speak Burmese and began studying the grammar. The difficulty for Judson in communicating in the new language was partly because Burmese has such a radically different structure than that of "Western" languages. He found a tutor and spent twelve hours per day studying the language. Judson and his wife firmly dedicated themselves into understanding the Burmese language. During this time they were almost entirely isolated from contact with any European or American. This was the case for their first three years in Burma. Four years passed before Judson dared even to hold a semi-public service. At first he tried adapting to Burmese customs by wearing a yellow robe to mark himself as a teacher of religion, but soon changed to white to show he was not a <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhist.html" title="Buddhist">Buddhist</a>. Then he gave up the whole attempt as artificial and accepted the fact that no matter how much he changed his clothes, no Burmese would identify him as anything but a foreigner. But he was aware of some accommodations to Burmese customs and built a <i><a href="../../../z/a/y/Zayat.html" title="Zayat">zayat</a></i>, the customary bamboo and thatch reception shelter, on the street near his home as a reception room and meeting place for Burmese men. 15 men came to his first public meeting in April 1819. He was encouraged but observed that he suspected that they had probably come more out of curiosity than anything else. Their attention wandered and they soon seemed uninterested. 2 months later he baptized his first Burmese convert, Maung Naw, a 35 year old timber worker from the hill tribes.</p>

<p>First attempts by the Judsons to interest the natives of Rangoon with the Gospel of Jesus met with almost total indifference. <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhist.html" title="Buddhist">Buddhist</a> traditions and the Burmese world view at that time led many to disregard the pleadings of Adorniram and his wife to believe in one "living" and "all-powerful God". To add to their discouragement, their second child, Roger William Judson, died at almost eight months of age. But Judson completed translation of the "Grammatical Notices of the Burman Language" the following July and then the <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Matthew_65a8.html" title="Gospel of Matthew">Gospel of Matthew</a> in 1817. Judson began public <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evangelism.html" title="Evangelism">evangelism</a> in 1818, sitting in a <a href="../../../z/a/y/Zayat.html" title="Zayat">zayat</a> by the roadside calling out "Ho! Everyone that thirsteth for knowledge!" His first convert was baptized in <a href="../../../1/8/1/1819.html" title="1819">1819</a>, and there were 18 converts by <a href="../../../1/8/2/1822.html" title="1822">1822</a>. But in 1820 Judson and a fellow missionary named Colman attempted to petition the Emperor of Burma, King <a href="../../../b/a/g/Bagyidaw.html" title="Bagyidaw">Bagyidaw</a>, in the hope that he would grant freedom for the missionaries to preach and teach throughout the country, as well as remove the sentence of death that was given for those Burmese who "changed religion". However, Bagyidaw disregarded their appeal and threw one of their Gospel tracts to the ground after reading a few lines. The missionaries returned to Rangoon and met with the fledgling church there to consider what to do next. The progress of Christianity would continue to be slow and with much risk of endangerment and death in the Burmese Empire.</p>
<p>By 1820, after 17 years of American Baptist missionary work, Judson reported only ten Burmese converts. Nevertheless there was much to encourage him. He had written a grammar of the language that is still in use today, and had begun to translate the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a>. His remarkable wife, Ann, was even more fluent in the spoken, conversational language of the people than her more academically literate husband, and made friends everywhere, with the kind wife of the viceroy of <a href="../../../r/a/n/Rangoon.html" title="Rangoon">Rangoon</a> as quickly as with illiterate workers and women. Moreover a printing press which had been sent from Serampore, and a missionary printer George Gough, whose arrival from America with his wife in 1817, produced the first printed materials in Burmese ever printed in Burma, including 800 copies of Judson’s translation of the <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Matthew_65a8.html" title="Gospel of Matthew">Gospel of Matthew</a>.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_AFM"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/d/o/Adoniram_Judson_c7d0.html#endnote_AFM" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/d/o/Adoniram_Judson_c7d0.html#endnote_AFM" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></sup></span> The chronicler of the church, Maung Shwe Wa, concludes this part of the story: “So was born the church in Rangoon – logger and fisherman, the poor and the rich, men and women. One travelled the whole path to Christ in three days; another took two years. But once they had decided for Christ they were his for all time.”</p>

<p>One of the early disciples was a teacher, U Shwe Ngong, leader of a group of intellectuals, dissatisfied with Buddhism, who were attracted to the new faith. He was a <a href="../../../d/e/i/Deist.html" title="Deist">Deist</a> skeptic, to whose mind the preaching of Judson, once a college skeptic himself, was singularly challenging, but he assured Judson that after consideration he was ready to believe in God, and Jesus Christ and the atonement. Judson, instead of welcoming him to the faith, pressed him further, asking if he believed what he had read in the gospel of Matthew, that <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> the son of God died on the cross. He shook his head, “Ah, you have caught me now. I believe that he suffered death, but I cannot believe he suffered the shameful death on the cross.” Not long thereafter he came back to tell Judson, “I have been trusting in my own reason, not the word of God…I now believe the crucifixion of Christ because it is contained in scripture.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_AFM"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/d/o/Adoniram_Judson_c7d0.html#endnote_AFM" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/d/o/Adoniram_Judson_c7d0.html#endnote_AFM" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></sup></span>”</p>
<p>The essence of Judson's preaching was a combination of conviction of the truth and rationality of the Christian faith, a firm belief in the authority of the Bible, and a determination to make Christianity relevant to the Burmese mind without ciolating the integrity of the Christian truth, or, as he put it, “to preach the gospel, not anti-Buddhism.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_AFM"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/d/o/Adoniram_Judson_c7d0.html#endnote_AFM" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/d/o/Adoniram_Judson_c7d0.html#endnote_AFM" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></sup></span>” By <a href="../../../1/8/2/1823.html" title="1823">1823</a>, ten years after his arrival, Judson could take pride that the membership of the little church had grown to eighteen, and that he had finally finished the first draft of his translation of the entire text of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_39c4.html" title="New Testament">New Testament</a> in <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burmese_language.html" title="Burmese language">Burmese</a>.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_AFM"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/d/o/Adoniram_Judson_c7d0.html#endnote_AFM" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/d/o/Adoniram_Judson_c7d0.html#endnote_AFM" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></sup></span></p>

<p>Two irreconcilable hungers triggered the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Anglo-Burmese_War_cd83.html" title="First Anglo-Burmese War">First Anglo-Burmese War</a> of 1824: Burma's desire for more territory, and Britain's desire for more trade. Burma threatened <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assam.html" title="Assam">Assam</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/n/Bengal.html" title="Bengal">Bengal</a>; Britain responded by attacking and absorbing two Burmese provinces into her India holdings to broaden her trade routes to East Asia. The war was a rough interruption of the Baptists' missionary work. English-speaking Americans were too easily confused with the enemy and suspected of spying.</p>
<p>Adoniram Judson was imprisoned for 17 months during the war between <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> and <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burma.html" title="Burma">Burma</a>, first at <a href="../../../a/v/a/Ava.html" title="Ava">Ava</a> and then at Aung Pinle. Judson and Price were violently arrested. Officers led by an official executioner burst into the Judson home, threw Mr. Judson to the ground before the eyes of his wife, bound him with torture thongs, and dragged him off the infamous, <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vermin.html" title="Vermin">vermin</a>-ridden "death prison" of <a href="../../../a/v/a/Ava.html" title="Ava">Ava</a>. Twelve agonizing months later he and Price, along with a small group of surviving Western prisoners, were marched overland, barefoot and sick, for six more months of misery in a primitive village near <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandalay.html" title="Mandalay">Mandalay</a>. Of the <a href="../../../s/e/p/Sepoy.html" title="Sepoy">sepoy</a> British prisoners-of-war imprisoned with them, all but one died. The sufferings and brutalities of those twenty long months and days in prison, half-starved, iron-fettered, and sometimes trussed and suspended by his mangle feet with only head and shoulders touching the ground, is described in unexaggerated detail by his wife, Ann, shortly after his release.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_AFM"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/d/o/Adoniram_Judson_c7d0.html#endnote_AFM" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/d/o/Adoniram_Judson_c7d0.html#endnote_AFM" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></sup></span> The heroic Ann was perhaps the greater model of supreme courage. Heedless of all threats against herself, left alone as the only Western woman in an absolute and anti-Christian monarchy at war with the West, beset with raging fevers and nursing a tiny baby her husband had not yet seen; she rushed from office to office in desperate attempts to keep her husband alive and win his freedom.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_AFM"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/d/o/Adoniram_Judson_c7d0.html#endnote_AFM" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/d/o/Adoniram_Judson_c7d0.html#endnote_AFM" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></sup></span></p>
<p>The end of the war should have been a time of rejoicing for the mission, As soon as her husband were released by the Burmese, Mrs Judson wrote that one good result of the war could be that terms of the treaty which ceded Burmese provinces to the British might provide opportunity to expand the witness of the mission into hitherto unreached parts of the country.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_AFM"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/d/o/Adoniram_Judson_c7d0.html#endnote_AFM" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/d/o/Adoniram_Judson_c7d0.html#endnote_AFM" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></sup></span></p>
<p>But a few months later, Ann was dead, a victim of the long, dreadful months of disease, death, stress and loneliness that had been hers for 21 months. She died alone. In <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_24.html" title="October 24">24 October</a> <a href="../../../1/8/2/1826.html" title="1826">1826</a>, Ann died at Amherst (now Kyaikkami), Burma, and their third child died six months later. Her husband was already out exploring in one of the ceded provinces, <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenasserim.html" title="Tenasserim">Tenasserim</a>. And it was in the wild hills of that newly British province of Tenasserim that the first signs of rapid growth in Protestant Christianity in Burma began. The statistics are startling. Within a few years of the end of the war, Baptist membership doubled on an average of every eight years for the thirty-two years between 1834 and 1866.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_AFM"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/d/o/Adoniram_Judson_c7d0.html#endnote_AFM" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/d/o/Adoniram_Judson_c7d0.html#endnote_AFM" rel="nofollow">[12]</a></sup></span></p>

<p>The collapse of Burma's armies brought Judson out of prison, but his release was not complete freedom. For several months in <a href="../../../1/8/2/1826.html" title="1826">1826</a> after the surrender, Burma pressed Judson into its service as a translator for the peace negotiations. Some have used Judson's acceptance of a role in the treaty negotiations as evidence of complicity in <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperialism.html" title="Imperialism">imperialism</a>, but it should be noted that he first acted on behalf of the defeated Burmese as translator, not for the Western victors.</p>
<p>The first Burmese pastor he ordained was Ko-Thah-a, one of the original group of converts, who refounded the church at <a href="../../../r/a/n/Rangoon.html" title="Rangoon">Rangoon</a>.</p>
<p>Three significant factors had a part, though not the only part, in the rise of the Burmese Baptist churches. Most of the growth was in British-ruled territory, not in the Burmese-ruled kingdom. It may also be significant that after an Anglo-Burmese war, the misionaries were American, not British. But probably the most telling factor was religion. Most of the growth came from animist tribes, not from the major population group, the Buddhist Burmese.</p>

<p>The nation was Burmese; its lost province was British; and the missionaries were American, but the “apostle” of that first numerically significant evangelistic breakthrough was neither British nor American nor Burman. He was a <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karen.html" title="Karen">Karen</a>, Ko Tha Byu,<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_AFM"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/d/o/Adoniram_Judson_c7d0.html#endnote_AFM" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/d/o/Adoniram_Judson_c7d0.html#endnote_AFM" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></sup></span> though credit is rightly due also to the three missionary pioneers to the Karen, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Boardman_3b5a.html" title="George Boardman">George Boardman</a> and his wife, Sarah, and Adoniram Judson.</p>
<p>The Karen people were a primitive, hunted minority group of ancient Burmo-Tibetan ancestry scattered in the forests and jungles of the <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salween_River_5087.html" title="Salween River">Salween River</a> and in the hills along the southeast coast.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_AFM"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/d/o/Adoniram_Judson_c7d0.html#endnote_AFM" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/d/o/Adoniram_Judson_c7d0.html#endnote_AFM" rel="nofollow">[14]</a></sup></span> Judson was the first missionary to make contact with them about 1827 when he ransomed and freed a debt-slave from one of his early converts. The freed slave, Ko Tha Byu, was an illiterate, surly man who spoke almost no Burmese and was reputed to be not only a thief but also a murderer who admitted killing at least thirty men, but could not remember exactly how many more.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_AFM"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/d/o/Adoniram_Judson_c7d0.html#endnote_AFM" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/d/o/Adoniram_Judson_c7d0.html#endnote_AFM" rel="nofollow">[15]</a></sup></span></p>
<p>In 1828 the former Karen bandit, “whose rough, undisciplined genius, energy and zeal for Christ” had caught the notice of the missionaries, was sent south with a new missionary couple, the Boardmans, into the territory of the strongly animistic, non-Buddhist Karen. There, he was no sooner baptized<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_AFM"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/d/o/Adoniram_Judson_c7d0.html#endnote_AFM" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/d/o/Adoniram_Judson_c7d0.html#endnote_AFM" rel="nofollow">[16]</a></sup></span> then he set off into the jungle alone to preach to his fellow tribespeople. Astonishingly, he found them strangely prepared for his preaching. Their ancient oracle traditions, handed down for centuries, contained some startling echoes of the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Testament_79e6.html" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a> that some scholars conjecture a linkage with Jewish communities (or possibly even Nestorians) before their migrations from western China into Burma perhaps as early as the twelfth century.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_AFM"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/d/o/Adoniram_Judson_c7d0.html#endnote_AFM" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/d/o/Adoniram_Judson_c7d0.html#endnote_AFM" rel="nofollow">[17]</a></sup></span></p>
<p>The core of what they called their “Tradition of the Elders” was a belief in an unchangeable, eternal, all-powerful God, creator of heaven and earth, of man, and of woman formed from a rib taken from the man. They believed in humanity’s temptation by a devil, and its fall, and that some day a messiah would come to its rescue. They lived in expectation of a prophecy that white foreigners would bring them a sacred parchment roll.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_AFM"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/d/o/Adoniram_Judson_c7d0.html#endnote_AFM" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/d/o/Adoniram_Judson_c7d0.html#endnote_AFM" rel="nofollow">[18]</a></sup></span></p>
<p>While the Boardmans and Ko Tha Byu were penetrating the jungles to the south, Adoniram Judson shook off a paralyzing year-long siege of depression that overcame him after the death of his wife, Ann, and set out alone on long canoe trips up the Salween River into the <a href="../../../t/i/g/Tiger.html" title="Tiger">tiger</a>-infested jungles to evangelize the northern Karen. Between trips he worked untiringly at his lifelong goal of translating the whole Bible into the <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burmese_language.html" title="Burmese language">Burmese language</a>. When he finished it at last in 1834, he had been labouring on it for twenty-four years. It was printed and published in 1835.</p>
<p>In April of that same year, he married <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarah_Hall_Boardman_bfb7.html" title="Sarah Hall Boardman">Sarah Hall Boardman</a>, widow of fellow missionary <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Boardman_3b5a.html" title="George Boardman">George Boardman</a>. They had eight children, five of whom survived to adulthood.Sarah's health began failing and physicians recommended a return to America. Sarah died en route at <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Helena_d518.html" title="St. Helena">St. Helena</a> on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_1.html" title="September 1">1 September</a> <a href="../../../1/8/4/1845.html" title="1845">1845</a>. He continued home, where he was greeted as a celebrity and toured the eastern seaboard raising the profile of and money for missionary activity. Because he could barely speak above a whisper due to pulmonary illness, his public addresses were made by speaking to an assistant, who would then address the audience.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_2.html" title="June 2">2 June</a> <a href="../../../1/8/4/1846.html" title="1846">1846</a>, Judson married for the third time, to writer <a href="../../../e/m/i/Emily_Chubbuck_9253.html" title="Emily Chubbuck">Emily Chubbuck</a> who he had commissioned to write memoirs for Sarah Hall Boardman. They had a daughter born in 1847.</p>
<p>Judson lived for fifteen more years of work in and for <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burma.html" title="Burma">Burma</a>. He lived to approve and welcome the first single women missionaries to Burma. A general rule of the mission had hitherto prevented such appointments. It was, said Judson, “probably a good” rule, “but our minds should not be closed” to making exceptions. The first two “exceptions” were extraordinarily exceptional. Miss Sarah Cummings arrived in <a href="../../../1/8/3/1832.html" title="1832">1832</a>. Miss Cummings proved her mettle at once, choosing to work alone with Karen evangelists in the <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaria.html" title="Malaria">malaria</a>-ridden Salween River valley north of Moulmein, but within to years she died of fever.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_AFM"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/d/o/Adoniram_Judson_c7d0.html#endnote_AFM" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/d/o/Adoniram_Judson_c7d0.html#endnote_AFM" rel="nofollow">[19]</a></sup></span> A second single woman, Eleanor Macomber, after five years of mission to the <a href="../../../o/j/i/Ojibway.html" title="Ojibway">Ojibway</a> Indians in <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michigan.html" title="Michigan">Michigan</a>, joined the mission in faraway Nurma in <a href="../../../1/8/3/1835.html" title="1835">1835</a>.

<p>When Judson began his mission in Burma, he set a goal of translating the Bible and founding a church of 100 members before his death. When he died, he left the bible, 100 churches, and over 8,000 believers. In large part due to his influence, <a href="../../../m/y/a/Myanmar.html" title="Myanmar">Myanmar</a> has the third largest number of Baptists worldwide, behind the United States and India. The majority of adherents are <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karen_people.html" title="Karen people">Karen</a> and <a href="../../../k/a/c/Kachin_people.html" title="Kachin people">Kachin</a>.

Inside the campus of <a href="../../../y/a/n/Yangon_University_3a2b.html" title="Yangon University">Yangon University</a> is Judson Church, named in his honor, and in 1920 Judson College, named in his honor, merged into Rangoon College, which has since been renamed Yangon University.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

The English-Burmese half was interrupted by his death and completed by missionary E. A. Steven. Every dictionary and grammar written in Burma in the last two centuries has been based on ones originally created by Judson. Judson "became a symbol of the preeminence of Bible translation for" Protestant missionaries.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> In the 1950s, Burma's Buddhist prime minister <a href="../../../u/_/n/U_Nu_d335.html" title="U Nu">U Nu</a> told the Burma Christian Council "Oh no, a new translation is not necessary. Judson's captures the language and idiom of Burmese perfectly and is very clear and understandable."<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> His translation remains the most popular version in Myanmar.</p>
<p>His conversion to Baptism, and subsequent need of support, led to the founding of the first national Baptist organization in the United States and subsequently to all American Baptist associations, including the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Baptist_Convention_a9e3.html" title="Southern Baptist Convention">Southern Baptists</a> that were the first to break off from the national organization. The printing of his wife Ann's letters about their mission inspired many Americans to become or support Christian missionaries. There are at least 36 Baptist churches in the United States named after him, <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judson_College%2C_Illinois_2c53.html" title="Judson College, Illinois">Judson College in Illinois</a> is named after him and <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judson_College_%28Alabama%29_7a95.html" title="Judson College (Alabama)">Judson College in Alabama</a> is named after his wife Ann.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
