<pre>
                                                      Chapter – 2
                                               Making Presentations
</pre>
<p>The entire King horses and all the King’s men, could not put Humpty Dumpty together again.’ For all the knowledge you have about tools and buttons, we still have not told you about how to create Presentations. But that is about to change, my friend. Let’s create Presentations. But that is about to change my friend. Let’s create Presentation, right now.</p>
<p><br />
Creating Your First Presentation</p>
<p>Remember the dialog box we saw while opening Power Point? Let’s see how you can create a Presentation using it Different options.</p>
<p>The Wizard OZ</p>
<p>The Auto Current Wizard is the best option for newbie in the sense that it lets you start making a Presentation fairly easily. It gets you started with Minimal fuss. If you select the Auto Content Wizard, you will see as Opening Dialog Box as shown.</p>
<pre>
   On the left the steps that the wizard takes you through. You can move forward by pressing next and back by pressing, well, beck.
</pre>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The second screen lets you choose the Presentation Type.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Look at all types and chooses the one that is most appropriate. If you can’t find one that is suitable, like for say a Presentation on WFF, choose Generic. Click on Next.</p>
<pre>
      On third screen you get to select the type of Presentation.
</pre>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
On screen Presentation is the most common and most appropriate one for our needs.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Click next and on the next screen, give your Presentation a nice name. In the footer entry you could enter your name.</p>
<pre>
    Click Next. Now the screen you see is the final one and you can click Back to go back and make any changes that you want.
</pre>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<pre>
        You can also cancel the whole thing and go to the lunch. If you’ve decided to take the plunge, all you need to do is to Click Finish and view your Presentation.
</pre>
<p>Using Templates</p>
<p>A template is a saved file that contains Predefined slide and title styles. If you have selected the Template Option you get a Dialog Box that’s looks like as shown in the figure.</p>
<pre>
     Select the Appropriate tab and the design that you look like the most, and click OK. Your Presentation will look like the Template Design.

</pre>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>If you select a Blank Presentation from the General Tab or Presentation Design Template the new slide Dialog box appears.</p>
<pre>
           Select the layout you want and click OK.
</pre>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
Saving and Opening your Presentation</p>
<p>You can open a Presentation by selecting the Open existing Presentation Option from the Power Point dialog box. You can also open a Presentation by selecting the Open Option from the File Menu.</p>
<pre>
       Now that you have created a Presentation, Let’s see how you can save it. After all what good is your piece of art if you can’t show it to others?  To save a Presentation select the Save as Option from the File Menu. A dialog box like the one shown below appears.

</pre>
<pre>
Inserting and Deleting Slides
</pre>
<p>A presentation about your Science Project may contain a lot of information. Even more than that can be fitted in a single slide. To insert more slides, all you have to do this:</p>
<pre>
      Go to the Insert menu and click the New Slide Option. This will invoke the Auto Layout dialog Box, as before. Select the appropriate auto layout and Click OK.
</pre>
<pre>
      To delete slides select the Normal view and then select the slide you want to delete.
             Now the most difficult part: Press the Delete Key.
              
                                                             
                                                   
                                                                    
                                                                            
                                                                                      
                                                                                                  
                                                  Chapter – 3
                                         Perk Up Your Presentation
</pre>
<p>Viewing Your Presentation</p>
<p>Till now you have learned about creating Presentations using Wizards and Templates working with slides etc. Now comes t real thing, viewing your very own Presentation and letting others see too!</p>
<pre>
       Power Point offers more than one way to view Presentation. Each view has a pre- defined function and use.
       You can check it out in the View Option from the View Menu (this is the easiest and fastest way to get a quick hand or viewing your Presentation).
</pre>
<p>Types of View are:</p>
<p><br />
Normal View:</p>
<pre>
This is the default view when you open Power Point. It gives a complete picture of each slide as shown. The slides are displayed separately in the current view.
    You can check it out in the slide option from the View menu.

</pre>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Slide View:</p>
<p>Slide view is the same as Normal view except that the details of the slides are hidden, and only their icons are shown. Also, the notes window is not present in this view. In fact, if you drag the separator bar between the slide and the icons, you get back to the normal view. Try it out by selecting slide option from the View Menu.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Slide Sorter View</p>
<p>It gives a small picture of each of the slide made by you.</p>
<pre>
   The view also shows you the order in which each slide is arranged. It will help to know that you now you can drag one slide over one another. So go ahead, make them in any order and finally rearrange them in slide sorter view. The slide number can be viewed at the bottom right corner of each slide. You can always see the time of each slide displayed whenever the presentation out put is meant to be slide show.
</pre>
<p><br /></p>
<p>For selecting a slide in slide sorter view use the arrow keys in the direction of the slide or left click on it. The slide will be highlighted with bold outlines. For selecting more than one slide press the shift key while clicking all the slides. If you want to rearrange any of the slides, then click and drag the slide to the position. Double clicking any slide will change the view of that slide-to-slide view.</p>
<p><br />
Slide Show View</p>
<p>It’s show time folks as know watch out for your very own presentation in full screen! Select the slide show option from the View menu and you can view your slide show . just Click to continue the show.</p>
<p><br />
Playing Around with Text</p>
<p>Whatever be the amount or size of text, it always forms an integral part of your presentation. Initially, you may think of text as the title of your presentation, but later on it increases with the size of your documentation under different text-boxes.</p>
<p>Editing and Formatting Text</p>
<p>Let’s create a new Blank Presentation.</p>
<pre>
   You will notice that in the default layout, a dotted rectangular box appears. Some sample text appears here which your own matter can replace. After finishing the written material, for deselecting the box click on any blank area outside the box. Remember this dotted box is called Placeholder.
</pre>
<p>Creating a New Object</p>
<p>Select the text button from drawing toolbar. Lay the pointer where you want the text to appear. On left-clicking the mouse a text box is displayed. Now go ahead and type whatever you want. On hitting enter a new line is started for the remaining text.</p>
<p><br />
Aligning Text</p>
<p>Alignment is nothing but how your text is placed. Your matter can be left, right or center aligned.</p>
<pre>
     For Aligning your Text:
     Keep the insertion point at any place in the paragraph you want to align.
     Select the alignment option from the Format menu.

</pre>
<p>Now decide the mode of alignment and choose it (Left is default). Alignment option can also be chosen from the formatting toolbar.</p>
<p>What is Bulleted Text? A type of listing used widely to lay emphasis or derived points in text. Instead of listing the points of paragraph numbered, you can use various symbols provided by the bulleted option in Format Menu.</p>
<p>To add a Bullet to a Piece of Text</p>
<pre>
   Select the bullet option in the Format Menu.
          Choose the color, size, symbol etc. from the appropriate sub menus.

            Click OK to apply.
</pre>
<p>This option can also be selected through the Formatting Toolbar.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Playing with different font styles and colours:</p>
<pre>
    Text enhancements include changing fonts, text styles, color, size and adding various effects. Fonts are group of characters sharing the same style and feel. To change the font:
     Select the text you want to change.
     Select the font option from the Formatting Toolbar.
     Now you can change the type, color, size as displayed.
    
</pre>
<p>For someone who wants to add a little flair to the presentation, can use the effects checkboxes. Select the appropriate formatting and click OK.</p>
<p><br />
Error correction and Spell Check</p>
<p>Sometimes you keep typing and later on your PowerPoint shows a whole of lot of words underlined in green and red. These are nothing but grammatical and spelling mistakes. If you need to edit and correct your text quickly then the following table needs to be at your tips.</p>
<p><br />
Pressing Arrow Keys Takes the insertion point as desired Pressing Backspace and Delete Key Deletes the character before and after the cursor respectively Double Click on a word Selects the complete word Click and drag of mouse Selects a sentence Triple Clicking on a line or Paragraph Selects the entire line or Paragraph</p>
<p>To check the Spelling Select the spelling option from the Tool Menu.</p>
<p><br />
You get options like ignore (overlook your error), change (rectify your error), change all (rectify all your error), ignore all and add.</p>
<pre>
     Repeat it till the end or when spellchecker displays a dialog box regarding completion of checking.
     Now you can feel free to type whatever you think is correct and leave the rest to spellchecker! But remember less the errors in your presentation, more it impresses your teacher.

</pre>
<p>Slides and color Fiesta</p>
<pre>
    An object drawn in PowerPoint has a fill color, line color and line style.
     Line styles can be narrow, bold, dashed, dotted etc.
</pre>
<p>Adding Colors</p>
<pre>
   For changing an object’s fill color:
    
  Select the object.
  Select the colors and line option from the Format Menu.
  The Format Auto Shape dialog box appears as Shown.
   
</pre>
<p>Select the colors and lines tab the current fill color. From the drop down list choose other colors and if you are one with the artistic mindset then go for custom colors.</p>
<pre>
     Fill effects option opens a dialog box offering gradient, texture, pattern and picture.

</pre>
<p>You can now explore many other advanced options like Shadings, Paterns, Format Auto shape etc.</p>
<p><br />
Color Schemes</p>
<p>Unions of colors which complement each other form a color scheme. In all there are seven such schemes. There are various color schemes available each controlling settings for background, text, lines, shadows, etc.</p>
<pre>
    Now you will learn how to change color scheme.
    Select the slide color scheme option from the Format Menu.
                                    
     
</pre>
<p>Using Templates As you have already studied earlier, templates re saved Presentation files for which fonts; font size, background etc. are distinctly defined.</p>
<p>Choosing a Template</p>
<p>Choose a fresh template from the new option from File Menu. The general tab offers blank Presentations. Presentation Design – contains professional designed templates on which you can mount your own Presentation. Presentations – contains some specific templates. It also holds the Auto current Wizard which is great help for beginners.</p>
