<h2><span class="mw-headline">Silk Smitha</span></h2>
<p>I'll respond to the rest of what you wrote later (ie, we can debate whether Silk Smitha falls under the accepted or known definition of a porn star), but please accept my unconditional apologies for (unintentionally) hurting your feelings. <a href="../../../b/i/n/User%7EBinand_2a99.html" title="User:Binand">Binand</a> 16:23, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First of all, my rev-vandalism comment was primarily about this edit by 221.128.175.59: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Silk_Smitha&amp;diff=77979820&amp;oldid=77926378" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Silk_Smitha&amp;diff=77979820&amp;oldid=77926378" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Unfortunate that I reverted your addition of category in the same edit and the comment stuck.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly, all Silk has done in movies is to dance to a few songs. I really haven't seen any reference to any of her movies that might even make her to be considered into the Shakeela standards - there are no frontal nudity scenes featuring her, for example. On the other hand, she (Silk) has a decent repertoire of movies in which her co-stars have included people like <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamal_Haasan_8b74.html" title="Kamal Haasan">Kamal Haasan</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/m/Mammootty.html" title="Mammootty">Mammootty</a> (at the peak of his career), <a href="../../../r/a/j/Rajnikanth.html" title="Rajnikanth">Rajnikanth</a> etc. If she is considered a porn star, I'd say Helen or several of today's Bollywood stars will fall under the same category.</dd>

<p>Hello Bhaia, One of my hobbies is to visit monuments/historical places and related museums and collect documents. During 1998-99 I lived in Rajshahi when I visited all the historical places along with the museums and collected some resourceful documents. During that period I visited Paharpur and Mahasthanghar several time and collected lots of myths, stories and real facts. I also purchased an expensive 'photo album' that contains all the important 'Borendro' pictures though copyrighted by Bangladesh Government. I believe, I can help you in those fields. If you need any assistance from me, just feel free to ask. Regards, (<a href="../../../n/i/a/User%7ENiaz_bd_8b5d.html" title="User:Niaz bd">Niaz bd</a> 04:56, 12 March 2007 (UTC))</p>

<dd>I just had a look at the article. It is really in very bad shape. The main problem is that it is virtually unreferenced. All the references are bunched together. This sort of an article cannot stand unless it has in-line references. A lot of POV is inbuilt into the article. People who worked earlier wrote in a newspaper style trying to analyse and fix the blame. Therefore, the first thing to do about it is to put the in-line references in place. Certain parts which cannot be referenced properly should be deleted. That is a task that I cannot do, because I am not that knowledgeable about the subject. Therefore, I can poke my nose in at a later stage. My interface with a similar subject was in <a href="../../../l/i/t/Literacy_in_India_c578.html" title="Literacy in India">Literacy in India</a>.

<p>Hi, I am still not totally sure about your points on Rajshahi University. The incidents you mention through the two links you provided on the talk page are there in the "criticism and controversy" section (which, by the way, is probably larger than any such section on any university on wikipedia), maybe using different references. Is the concern about the 1908s violence? There are allusions to it in the article, though I couldn't find references. In any case, once I understand which things specifically you would like to see included, I can try to work on them.
