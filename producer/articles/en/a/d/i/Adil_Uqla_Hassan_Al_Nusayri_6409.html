<p>Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Conventions_eb47.html" title="Geneva Conventions">Geneva Conventions</a> to captives from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_war_on_terror.html" title="The war on terror">the war on terror</a>. This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competent_tribunal.html" title="Competent tribunal">competent tribunals</a> to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_war.html" title="Prisoner of war">prisoner of war</a> status.</p>
<p>Subsequently the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Defense_0d6c.html" title="Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a> instituted the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combatant_Status_Review_Tribunal_41dd.html" title="Combatant Status Review Tribunal">Combatant Status Review Tribunals</a>. The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were <i>lawful combatants</i> -- rather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an <a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_combatant.html" title="Enemy combatant">enemy combatant</a>.</p>

<p>Al Nusayri acknowledged traveling to Afghanistan. But he said he traveled there for sightseeing, not for jihad. He had traveled to Pakistan, the neighboring country, for medical treatment.</p>
<p>Al Nusayri said the Taliban suspected he was a spy, because he was a police officer back in Saudi Arabia, and put him in prison.</p>
<p>Al Nusayri admitted to being on the bean farm. The Taliban had taken him there, involuntarily, from prison,</p>

<ul>
<li>Al Nusayri's said his medical problems arose from a car accident he had been in. He said he had 27 fractures in his head, and his vision was affected. <i>"I heard that the medicine in Pakistan, especially for the eyes, was the best in the world."</i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Al Nusayri said he was in the Taliban prison for approximately two and a half months. Then the Taliban kept him, and a number of other prisoners on the farm for about 15 days. Then the Taliban told them they were going to aid them to cross into Pakistan where they could return to their family. Parts of their trip to Pakistan was on foot. Other parts were by truck. Once they arrived at a village in Pakistan there was a feast, and then he and the other prisoners were woken in the middle of the night and handed over to Pakistani soldiers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Al Nuaayri confirmed that he never carried a weapon during his travels. He was still a prisoner during his passage through the mountains.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Al Nusayri was a prisoner in a bus transporting prisoners from one prison to another, that was fired at, and crashed:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>"While I was in prison. They were moving us from one prison to another prisoa I was on the bus sleeping. I heard people firing at the bus and I got hit with a bullet in my arm and broke my arm. The bus turned over, and they just kept moving us. From that point, they took me to Pakistan and took me to the hospital there."</i></dd>
