<h2><span class="mw-headline">The self proclaimed messiahs</span></h2>
<p>Don't like this tag ( which it is, a tag ) rather than a useful category , what is it with the WP people -- list madness -- cat&#160;: blonde eskimos etc , short for " freaks" , " wacko's" " ,weirdo's" " nutjobs by category "</p>
<p>Is Adi Da a messiah at all in the Judeo-christian sense&#160;? He clearly states he is not the "Creator God" here "Therefore no one should misunderstand me. By Avatarically revealing and confessing my Divine status to one and all, I am not indulging in self-appointment, or illusions of grandiose Divinity. I am not claiming the status of the 'Creator God'."</p>
<p>Messiah is really a judeo-christian-Muslim cultural construct . Avatar is much closer to the Hindu root of Adi Da's lineage ( and he is listed in the list of avatars ). Although Adi Da is salvatory in some sense he is not a messiah ( definately not in the Judeo Christian sense as this cat seems to indicate ) in my opinion and does not fit this ( rather silly cat )</p>
<p>I have met at least 2 unfortunate messiah claimants in my life , both were clearly and very sadly tortured and sad souls in need of help , both claimed to be JC , this is the usual pattern and is a medical condition but even then many don't like to categorise people -- you know "mad" etc , should not be in WP at all perhaps</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Future of Adidam</span></h2>
<p>Would anyone else be interested in a short section on the future of Adidam? I am curious to know what will happen to the movement on the passing of Adi Da, and what sort of political/philosophical ramifications this may have. Are there procedures in place for when this occurs? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelebrityguyxy_1b96.html" title="User:Celebrityguyxy">Celebrityguyxy</a> (<a href="../../../c/e/l/User_talk%7ECelebrityguyxy_0408.html" title="User talk:Celebrityguyxy">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Celebrityguyxy_abd0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Celebrityguyxy">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Jones has written/said in the past that he may designate "murti-gurus" as successors if he believes anyone has attained to his unique 7th stage. (Can't remember where -- Dawn Horse Testament?) Their role would basically be to channel him aka God; he'll always be the FLO Narcissist in Adidam. My guess would be that Jones keeps it all in the family and designates one or more wives a/o daughters as successor(s). I wouldn't be surprised to see some wrangling after his death; the group's accumulated wealth (real estate, art etc.) that Jones controls<a href="http://lightmind.com/library/daismfiles/parker.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://lightmind.com/library/daismfiles/parker.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><a href="http://lightmind.com/library/daismfiles/masters.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://lightmind.com/library/daismfiles/masters.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> is not trivial and may be worth an attempted schism or two.

<dd>Hi Celebrityguyxy, re your Q about the future of Adidam in the event of the Gurus passing , Adi Da as an authentic Spiritual Master has put and continues to put immense spiritual and practical effort into the survival of Adidam as an authentic New Religious Movement, a means to God Realisation for devotees , now and into the future. He has also stated Adidam is unlikely to, or cannot survive ( with true integrity ) without spiritualy mature ( or enlightened devotees )into the future, so nothing is for sure, as with all things --<a href="../../../s/c/r/User%7EScribe5_68f7.html" title="User:Scribe5">Scribe5</a> 22:41, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Neutrality Tag</span></h2>
<p>This article has a negative tone and needs re working the teaching section has been written by active enemies of Adidam and weighted for a negative impact , rather than a neutral positon, it has been argued over and again that the Lead should not have these allegations in it, as it burdens the overall life to a negative critical degree. The tag should remain until ( and if ever ) balance is restored --202.63.42.221 08:51, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I understand the concerns about the Lead section from Da advocates, but from WP's standpoint, the sources cited for 1985 are the most reliable ones in the article (see <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>). These events occurred, and Jones bore substantial responsibility for them. The teaching section should comment on books actually in print, e.g. his most notable ones like KOL, Easy Death, DHT, etc. I have no objection to expanded it in that way as long as it's written encyclopedically and not devotionally. Overall, it's up to the reader to decide the overall good/bad balance; as editors we need to allow all verifiable, significant views adequate space to be expressed. thx, <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim_Butler_5a6c.html" title="User:Jim Butler">Jim Butler</a><sup>(<a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJim_Butler_4c38.html" title="User talk:Jim Butler">talk</a>)</sup> 17:43, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You're probably right regarding the blogs, but I don't think you're right regarding the lawsuits. Hard copies of the O'Mahony and Miller complaints are available respectively from Marin and Lake county courts. They're a matter of public record, they have been republished online, and verifying them is only slightly harder than a trip to the library. They've also been referenced in various news media ca. 1985-86. <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a> says:
<dl>
<dd><i>Where a fact has first been presented by a verifiable secondary source, it is acceptable to turn to open records as primary sources to augment the secondary source. Material that is related to their notability, such as court filings of someone notable in part for being involved in legal disputes, are allowable, as are public records such as graduation dates, dates of marriage licenses and the like, where they are publicly available and where that information has first been reported by a verifiable secondary source.</i></dd>

<dd>I disagree. There is a difference between the report that a lawsuit has been filed and the possibly false details in the filing. If a court has not ruled on the facts, such an affidavit should not be referenced. Many suits are malicious and the "facts" contained in them may be no more than slander. Note that <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a> says the court filings <i>of</i> someone notable, not court filings <i>about</i> them. There is a difference. Again, I do not believe documents filed by <i>others</i> are acceptible under <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a>, only their existence is verifiable, the facts in them are not unless and until a court rules on them.

This article is a case where the content of complaints and depositions was reported by news media that are V RS's, so I would argue that's it's fine also to cite those primary sources to augment the media reports. <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a> says to remove unsourced potential libel, not material that represents a sig POV and comes from a V RS, even if an editor worries that it <i>may</i> be libelous.

WP's <a href="../../../l/e/a/Wp%7Elead.html#Length" title="Wp:lead">three-paragraph guideline for medium-length articles</a> is no reason to delete notable and verified material (besides, the Wilber paragraph is just a single sentence).</p>
<p>Your also said "... and critical material belongs in its own section, not the lead." I can't find any WP policy supporting that. <a href="../../../l/e/a/WP%7ELEAD_4179.html" title="WP:LEAD">WP:LEAD</a> clearly states otherwise: <i>"The lead section....should provide an overview of the main points the article will make, summarizing the primary reasons the subject matter is interesting or notable, and including a mention of its notable controversies, if there are any."</i> There isn't any question that Da's 1985 controversy was notable; it made the Today Show. Also please note that the material you deleted was well-sourced with reliable secondary sources, which in WP terms are better sources than the self-published Adidam material on which much of the rest of the article relies. For these reasons I'm reverting your removal of this material from the lead. peace, <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim_Butler_5a6c.html" title="User:Jim Butler">Jim Butler</a><sup>(<a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJim_Butler_4c38.html" title="User talk:Jim Butler">talk</a>)</sup> 05:04, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

Looking at the para above, removing the sentence on lawsuits would give:
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Allegations that Adi Da and members of his group engaged in financial, psychological, physical, and sexual abuse were widely reported in American news media in 1985<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/11/AR2005061100724.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/11/AR2005061100724.html" rel="nofollow">[13]</a><a href="http://lightmind.com/thevoid/daism/sfchron-04.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://lightmind.com/thevoid/daism/sfchron-04.html" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>, including <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Today_Show_8f75.html" title="The Today Show">The Today Show</a>.<a href="http://www.rickross.com/reference/adida/adida1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rickross.com/reference/adida/adida1.html" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> Adidam disputed these allegations.<a href="http://www.northcoastjournal.com/011499/cover0114.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.northcoastjournal.com/011499/cover0114.html" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> No new reports of such abuse have appeared in the news media since that time.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>That's a concise summary, and doesn't repeat anything from the article either (except for that slightly-rephrased last sentence, the inclusion of which pro-Da editors have insisted on, and seems fair). Of course, <a href="../../../l/e/a/WP%7ELEAD_4179.html" title="WP:LEAD">WP:LEAD</a> doesn't forbid such repetition, and I notice you haven't objected to it with the Wilber sentence. Perhaps, as your earlier edit summary suggested, you do have a problem with critical material in the lead. But it's notable and verifiable, so according to both <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/a/WP%7ELEAD_4179.html" title="WP:LEAD">WP:LEAD</a>, not to mention NPOV and VER, it belongs there.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, I'll put the edited version back in. BTW, please re-read <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a>, which says "<b>Do not simply revert changes in a dispute</b>. When someone makes an edit you consider biased or inaccurate, <i>improve</i> the edit, rather than reverting it." I'd have been happy to adjust the lead as above if you'd been clear about your objections. Please extend the same courtesy, and try to improve notable/verifiable stuff rather than removing it.

<dd>Hi Scribe5. The material you removed<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adi_Da&amp;diff=76881036&amp;oldid=76873232" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adi_Da&amp;diff=76881036&amp;oldid=76873232" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> is well-sourced.

Da is still saying he's the First, Last and Only Seventh-Stage Adept-Realizer<a href="http://www.adidam.tv/seventeen-companions-2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.adidam.tv/seventeen-companions-2.html" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>. WP isn't censored (see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and possible offensiveness to other religious groups isn't a criterion for removing material from the article. Nor is WP paper, so there's no reason to remove verified material. Da has said many things over the years, some of which are out of print, and WP provides a chance for readers to be exposed to a wide range of what he has said (irrespective of the current Adidam "official versions"), and what others have said about him. Deleting this verified material isn't appropriate. thanks, <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim_Butler_5a6c.html" title="User:Jim Butler">Jim Butler</a><sup>(<a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJim_Butler_4c38.html" title="User talk:Jim Butler">talk</a>)</sup> 06:14, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>P.S. - I didn't author that section, btw, and can see how it could be rewritten to be less "in your face" toward other religions while still conveying that basic point that Da says he's the FLO. regards, <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim_Butler_5a6c.html" title="User:Jim Butler">Jim Butler</a><sup>(<a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJim_Butler_4c38.html" title="User talk:Jim Butler">talk</a>)</sup> 17:24, 21 September 2006 (UTC) .... OK, removed the inflammatory "even"; the rest sounds like a neutral presentation of what Da says. (I may have at some point in thr past edited the Jesus and Buddha stuff to tone it down as well.)

<p>Again that is your emphasis and interpretation and language (FLO) nothing to do with Adidam and Adi Da, try giving your own interpretation and emphasis on a majority religion on Wiki and see what happens ( rather than a minority religion as Adidam is) , and yes since friends supporters of Adidam study current Adidam texts it stands to reason they know a of a lot more about current teaching than an former devotees ,since Adi Da is a living and very active creative teacher , current teaching trends should supersede former works , they could be accounted for in time but that would be be in future as the Article is refined and that may take years <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../s/c/r/User%7EScribe5_68f7.html" title="User:Scribe5">Scribe5</a> (<a href="../../../s/c/r/User_talk%7EScribe5_21a3.html" title="User talk:Scribe5">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Scribe5_3c41.html" title="Special:Contributions/Scribe5">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>FLO refers to "the first, last, and only seventh stage Adept-Realizer", which are Da's own words <a href="http://www.adidam.tv/seventeen-companions-2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.adidam.tv/seventeen-companions-2.html" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>.

However, I checked those references again, and they don't explicitly mention Jesus and Buddha. Da did, in a talk once, clearly say Jesus was 5 and Buddha 6. Till we find that, I agree it shouldn't be included. However, the FLO thing should stay. Lots of other religions say their guy is the grandest of kahunas, so it shouldn't be a big deal to tell the truth about what Da says as well.</dd>

<dd>Facts are that despite Adidam claims that Alan Watts intended to join Adidam, he simply liked what he read in Knee of Listening, and original Method of the Siddhas, consisting of talks from the opening of the Ashram on April 25, 1972 to early January 1973. His "avatar" comment was written after being personally visited and recruited by members of the group and watching a video of the then Bubba over a meal and wine, and Watts was known to have a weakness for alcohol. He did not visit the Ashram or Da, and he did not rush to become a student, he agreed to a future meeting with Bubba (Da) to consider their future relationship, and the Ashram at that time was in a more conservative period of strict conditions, preceding the wild period described as "Garbage and the Goddess". There is no reason to believe that Alan Watts would have remained enamored with Adi Da, since as he said in his forward: "...But if you genuinely know this, it is nothing to be proud of nor humble about. It is just what is so, and there is absolutely no necessity to parade it by defying social conventions, on the one hand, or by coming on as one who is extremely holy, on the other. The hapless Rasputin was, perhaps, an example of the first case, and Meher Baba of the second though he had a jolly face and a lively twinkle in the eye..." Even if he had eventually joined, had he lived, after a little experience he would have left as disillusioned as Mr. Garvey did a few years later. Furthermore, the Watts family has apparently requested Adidam to stop misusing the "endorsement". Mention of Watts in the article is fine in principle but not in the lead when it is falsely implied that Watts "repeatedly" commented favorably about Da or that he had any personal knowledge or experience of Da. It just isn't so. <a href="../../../d/s/e/User%7EDseer_123d.html" title="User:Dseer">Dseer</a> 06:30, 5 November 2006 (UTC)Dseer</dd>

<dd>Hmmm, there seem to be two issues here: copyright and reliability of source.
<ul>
<li>On copyright, the links in question say: <i>"NOTE: For non-commercial and educational use only. It is believed that this low-bandwidth video clip constitutes "Fair Use" under copyright law."</i> <a href="../../../c/_/_/WP%7EC_2f43.html" title="WP:C">WP:C</a> says: <i>"If the site in question is making fair use of the material, linking is fine."</i> FWIW.</li>
<li>On reliability: this is arguably the equivalent of a newspaper article reproduced on a third-party site, which WP does allow in the EL section. If it's up to editors to review reliability of offline sources reproduced online, well, I can attest that the videos posted aren't faked; I've seen a videotape of this material, and also the script appears to be the same as a transcript that's been posted by a notable third party <a href="http://www.rickross.com/reference/adida/adida1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rickross.com/reference/adida/adida1.html" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I agree WP needs to be careful with YouTube, but each case should be evaluated individually. In this instance, there's a good case to be made for reliability. As for copyright issues, I lack the legal expertise to make that call. -<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim_Butler_5a6c.html" title="User:Jim Butler">Jim Butler</a><sup>(<a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJim_Butler_4c38.html" title="User talk:Jim Butler">talk</a>)</sup> 08:01, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This video of the Today show expose on the Da organization back from 1985 is genuine, I've seen it before, and the transcript is available on one or more of the links, and that was published long ago. This is not some music video or a video of commercial value being improperly linked, and fair use provisions apply. No issues of copyright violations have been claimed during this period. There is no commercial market for this expose, nor is it being exploited for commercial purposes or in a manner inconsistent with the intent of the story, an expose on Da Free John. Here, not only is the link publically asserted to be in compliance with fair use provisions, but it is the subject of directly related discussion and commentary in the context of the article, not commercial exploitation or violation of copyright. <a href="../../../d/s/e/User%7EDseer_123d.html" title="User:Dseer">Dseer</a> 03:10, 8 November 2006 (UTC)Dseer</dd>

<dd><b>On Reliability:</b> Do you know who this "somavd" is? Even if you do, should we trust this person to have not modified the video? Anyone can upload anything to YouTube and with the technology we have now it would take little effort to make the segment say anything I wanted. If you have a transcript from a reliable source, then use that instead.</dd>
<dd><b>On Copyright status:</b> The material is clearly copyrighted. 1985 is well within the 100 year limit. Ok... so a fair use claim is being made. However, "fair use" does not count in this case since "critical commentary" is not being made, "YouTube.com" is not an educational site and reproducing the entire segment has a major negative commercial impact on the value of the clip. (Yeah, they aren't selling it now... but that's largely irrelevant.)</dd>
<dd>Moving forward I'd suggest replacing the YouTube link with a citation to the program directly.

The YouTube issue is apparently mooted by <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>, per <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">User:Dmcdevit</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adi_Da&amp;diff=86669806&amp;oldid=85799331" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adi_Da&amp;diff=86669806&amp;oldid=85799331" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>. However, the general issues of copyright and reliability are relevant to non-YouTube sources, so I'd like to comment on them, and seek your thoughts.</dd>
<dd><b>On reliability</b>: let's say a textual source exists offline in a V RS, and editors cite it in the article. Then a copy of it is found online. The online source is self-published and not a V RS, and being just a string of ASCII characters could easily have been faked, but editors familiar with the original offline source are able to verify that it is indeed an accurate copy of the original. Copyright issues notwithstanding, may articles link to that online source, simply as a convenience to the reader? If so, how is YouTube different? (I believe an earlier version of either <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> or <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> said something about this issue, but can't find it now.)</dd>
<dd><b>On copyright</b>: a highly Google-ranked site hosted at Stanford Univ. says this:
<dl>
<dd><i>Q: How will I know if what I'm doing is Fair Use?</i></dd>
<dd><i>[A:] Get sued and get a court to determine your case. Sadly, unless your facts match perfectly with a previous court case in your jurisdiction, this is what you need to do.</i><a href="http://fairuse.stanford.edu/commentary_and_analysis/2003_07_minow.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://fairuse.stanford.edu/commentary_and_analysis/2003_07_minow.html" rel="nofollow">[31]</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>That being the case, by what metric should WP editors determine Fair Use?</dd>

<dd>"On reliability:" - Your right... YouTube is no different then any other dubious self-published "copied" text. I have simply singled out YouTube in my work because its is such a MAJOR problem (11k links from wikipedia to youtube, 4k in articles). Websites on free-hosts have a the same problem.</dd>
<dd>"On Fairuse" - Yeah, fairuse is complicated. The basic rubric is "When in doubt, leave it out." As far as I know Wikipedia hasn't had to fight any FairUse battles yet, so I think sticking to that philosophy will be a good idea. ---<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User%7EJ.smith_e018.html" title="User:J.smith">J.S</a> (<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User_talk%7EJ.smith_6ef6.html" title="User talk:J.smith">t</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_J.smith_698b.html" title="Special:Contributions/J.smith">c</a>) 15:35, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks JS; agree about being extra careful on Fair Use given WP's potential liability. On reliability of online copies, I'm not sure where to draw the line, especially in the case I mention where the offline source has already been vetted and cited by editors, and is confirmed by those editors to be accurate. I'm sure this has been discussed before, but I'll ask at <a href="../../../v/_/_/WT%7EV_c6a9.html" title="WT:V">WT:V</a> to clarify. regards, <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim_Butler_5a6c.html" title="User:Jim Butler">Jim Butler</a><sup>(<a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJim_Butler_4c38.html" title="User talk:Jim Butler">talk</a>)</sup> 07:21, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
