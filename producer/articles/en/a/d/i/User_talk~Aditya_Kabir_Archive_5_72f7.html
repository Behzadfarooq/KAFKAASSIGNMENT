<h2><span class="mw-headline">Logo in common</span></h2>
<p>I think I'm overdoing the appendix bit. Yes, vandal people can only be harmful. But You didn't mention the logo license in common. What should it be? I uploaded logo there under {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL_bb04.html" title="Template:GFDL">GFDL</a>}}. There is no logo license available there.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">About Private University-3 &amp; image</span></h2>
<p>I know about the tag {{help me}}. You shouldn't have changed the category of IUB. The categories were relevant to the article NOT HARDLY RELEVANT (It might be your opinion). That university (along with other private university) is located at Baridhara (Dhaka) in the BD&#160;!&#160;!&#160;! I think mentioning those categories aren't making any problem. Check other universities as well. It seems to me that you are too emtional or U have an envy on private university related article and you are trying to change it in that way. I'm not shooting ur messanger. Now come to the image. I mistakenly uploaded more than 1 iub logo (Some of them were made as in art category as u've already seen them in cotribution page). Actually, I uploaded those logos while writing this article and several time I tried to change the article. That's why I uploaded several logo with 3 different name(under the license{{logo}}) one is already tagged. I was looking for appropriate logo (and its color) for the article. How can I remove that tag for keeping this logo (the colored logo not that black and white logo) or should I <b>replace</b> it with previous image(I've already replaced it with another IUB logo).If it's not possible than how can I keep this current/another colored logo under the license {{logo}}. <b>1 logo should be exist</b>. If that/those logo(s) get deleted, I wanna upload the iub logo again. Will that be a problem?? and also is it a problem to upload same image several time by changing their name? Don't just try to catch only errors rather try to give solution(c bold text in appendix). <a href="../../../n/a/h/User%7ENAHID_6918.html" title="User:NAHID">NAHID</a><sup>(<a href="../../../n/a/h/User_talk%7ENAHID_a181.html" title="User talk:NAHID">talk</a>)</sup> 5:12, 21 December 2006 (UTC)<br />
<br />
<b>Appendix:</b> I've noticed a license {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFair_use_in_d68b.html" title="Template:Fair use in">Fair use in</a>}}(Where they are used...?) and it's different form. Can it be used 4 those logo that I uploaded with different name? If u know better then which license ({{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein2_5c81.html" title="Template:Fairusein2">Fairusein2</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein3_deb0.html" title="Template:Fairusein3">Fairusein3</a>}} is appropriate 4 the logo that I want to keep or should I apply this license to all the logo that I uploaded with different name? Don't just mention those WP's (You can say, <b>this license {{}} is appropriate 4 the logo or other images if it's tagged under speedy deletion</b> ). Give me the ans.<br />
<br />
<b>Appendix 2:</b> Thanks for your answers. I'm appreciating that. Please visit in <a href="../../../b/u/e/BUET_96cd.html" title="BUET">BUET</a> and <a href="../../../r/u/e/RUET_48fb.html" title="RUET">RUET</a> and see the category or you can perform quick check through this template {{<a href="../../../p/u/b/Template%7EPublic_Universities_of_Bangladesh_b5d7.html" title="Template:Public Universities of Bangladesh">Public Universities of Bangladesh</a>}} for other universities as well. There are numerous educational institution which contains multiple category. I'll try my best to add content on those empty articles, which are in the entries. Now I understand the logo problem. They were same logo right. However I want to keep that convocation (<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_University_of_Asia_Pacific_320d.html" title="The University of Asia Pacific">The University of Asia Pacific</a>) image anyway, which has been tagged. That image may contain wrong license {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}}. I think the license {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EPromophoto_9608.html" title="Template:Promophoto">promophoto</a>}} may be appropriate for that image. Because it can be taken by the University press kit. If you know the proper license for that convocation image, then please mention. I want to replaced it with that. I still have a big confusion about the license of those images which are basically taken from the website. I noticed those type of images are usually uploaded under {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL_bb04.html" title="Template:GFDL">GFDL</a>}}, {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}}, {{<a href="../../../c/c/-/Template%7ECc-by-sa_1019.html" title="Template:Cc-by-sa">cc-by-sa</a>}}(version 1 or 2) or other kind of license. I read about this license in WP though. Can you please mention this type of images (proper) license? If I uploade images with wrong license can I change it by replacing correct license? You wrote, "deleting a notice that states what happened to something you uploaded or posted would not make the problem go away". Again My question is if a image is tagged under speedy deletion can I remove it by replacing appropriate license? I did it with amisha and hrtithik jpg. Because I found lot of images are in this {t1|promophoto}} category. Another matter is about the license{{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFair_use_in_d68b.html" title="Template:Fair use in">Fair use in</a>}}. Please see here<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Selena.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Selena.jpg" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Can I use this license on any image (including that <b>convocation image</b>) which is relevant to the its article? Although I don't want to describe too much about the image. Now come to the Hugo Chavez. I had some question about the wikimedia common. Some of the pictures of Hugo Chavez are taken from the wikimedia common and in the image page there is a license <b>This image is from wikimedia common</b>.... I uploaded the images of IUB at first in wikipedia and then in wikimidia. In that case do I need to mention license in image page that "it is taken from wikimedia common"? If so then how? Though I was the uploader. Another thing, do You know the license of logo in wikimedia common? Because common has very few license of images. When I was uploading the logo I did not find any logo license. If u know then let me know the license, the way I mentioned avobe. I think I've repeated some question.

<p>Thanks 4 your guideline about WP's (Though I had a look on them b4..but didn't have enough time to read). Later on, In template, materials could be added on those empty pages and (also on the pages, which has been deleted). Now can you please visit in <a href="../../../../bn/index.html" class="extiw" title="bn:">Bangla wikipedia</a>. There you'll find a similar template named "Private Universities in Bangaldesh or বাংলাদেশের বেসরকারী বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়" (I hope u have an acn on bangla wiki).Because, in that template, most of the pages are empty(except 2 or 3 pages). You can aslo perform your tag job there. Did you click on the convocation image in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_University_of_Asia_Pacific_320d.html" title="The University of Asia Pacific">The University of Asia Pacific</a> (or r u overacting)&#160;?? I did't upload that. You should've checked the user name properly!! It was uploaded by <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemind_boy_63d0.html" title="User:Bluemind boy">User Bluemind boy</a>. I uploaded 2 images (Hrithik and Amisha) under GNU . I didn't find any <b>License</b> for images, which are only found in the internet (there are lot of images r available in this category)&#160;? Most of the actors/actresses or notable persons image are available on the net. I've bit confusion about this type images license. I've already noticed a license {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EPromophoto_9608.html" title="Template:Promophoto">Promophoto</a>}}, it may be replaced instead of GNU 4 the images of Hrithik and Amisha . What can be the appropriate license 4 those images(Which are mostly found on the net)&#160;? Check <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madhuri_Dixit_2ada.html" title="Madhuri Dixit">Madhuri Dixit</a>. You should also check other Indian actors/actresses pictures as well. If you want to change something mercilessly then notify it with solution!!. Check random articles if you find any errors, don't stick with the same User along with his/her article.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">About Private University</span></h2>
<p>You reverted the redirects, but not completely. If I get enough information hence I'll put stuffs on those pages or some1 else could do that.You don't have to worry for that. Now come to the point, you are acting like a vandal (I think you are)!!! How do you know I'm putting too much advertising stuff on the article?? That was a basic introduction about IUB (not advertising stuff). But you were keeping unnecessary thought in your mind. That's why you changed it. You also put {{fact}} that was unnecessary. I put those external links (Schools of the University and clubs and organizations) on the article so that some1 can get quickly access to the desired web pages. Please visit <a href="../../../d/u/q/Duquesne_University_c432.html" title="Duquesne University">Duquesne University</a>, <a href="../../../d/r/e/Drexel_University_ee3e.html" title="Drexel University">Drexel University</a> and <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_University_c8f9.html" title="Duke University">Duke University</a>. See their external links (multiple links under the same website). Multiple links are not harmful as you think. You also mentioned a tag has been placed on United University of Bangladesh. But it's showing the "List of schools in Bangladesh"(Redirected from United University of Bangladesh). Where is the tag&#160;?!! You copied some thought from user Zetawoof. Please don't do nonsense type change on the article. You aren't only the reader.

<p>The comments weren't for your request. It was my own comment only for you. Please check the university again. I've already mentioned its type and other things above. I can't claim myself as a cleverer person. I'm trying to learning new things here. Since I volunteered here I got advice from some admin and user as well. I appreciated their advice and I will. Sorry for those comments. Yes that may leave me alone from you. As you are working on wp:npov (ramdom article and educational institution in Bangladesh) and other policy then keep that. If you change only one/two article by using wp:npov, then why don't you change other articles. That, those aren't written based on wp:npov. Are you looking for newcomers who can make these errors and you can change them easily and immediately, huh!!! and not those articles(lack of wp:npov) written by admins. Another thing, I couldn't add content on BUET. why didn't you change BUET introduction and its other contents based on wp:npov. Aren't you checking other educational organizations/article (whether they are written under wp:npov or not)? <a href="../../../n/a/h/User%7ENAHID_6918.html" title="User:NAHID">NAHID</a> 12:30, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
