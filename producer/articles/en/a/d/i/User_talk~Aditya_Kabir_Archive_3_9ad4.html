<p>Hi - I decided to post a reply here to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Log_2006_June_23_877d.html#To_Booty_or_not_to_Booty" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Log/2006 June 23">this discussion in AfD</a>.</p>
<p>I am no authority on this, but here goes: the same Wikipedia standards certainly should apply across the board. "Whose standards"? First of all, your own (what you choose to contribute), and then, everybody else's plus your own (how the article is further edited/discussed/and so on, by you and everybody else on Wikipedia).</p>
<p>If an article ends up in AfD (Articles for Deletion), like <i>Bangladesh Booty</i>, it's because a user has decided it may contravene Wikipedia policies, and so it may require deletion. As you will have seen, lots of inappropriate articles are added to Wikipedia every day. It is not always a bad thing to be in AfD, as long as the problem can be fixed. In AfD, <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html#How_to_discuss_an_AfD.2FWikietiquette" title="WP:AFD">this process</a> takes over (the discussion of the articles, as you have seen).</p>
<p>The article will stay in AfD for five days before an administrator assesses the consensus (it isn't a straight vote, it is an assessment that takes account of all the opinions expressed) and then takes action. The exception is a <b>Speedy</b> <b>Keep/Delete</b>, which doesn't take five days - but <i>Booty</i> has not been recommended for Speedy Delete, so it's OK.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about how an admin decides on consensus, you'll need to get an admin to describe their job to you, because I am not an admin, and I do not know exactly what they do either. But admins are the ones who finally "decide" whether to keep/delete articles in AfD. (They also sign the articles in AfD when kept/deleted, and so you can easily find an admin by clicking their usernames in AfD and leaving a question on their talk page - any of them will be able to answer your questions.)</p>
<p>Anyway - <i>Booty</i> is in AfD because someone decided it seemed to be an unnotable film and there was no evidence that it was notable.</p>
<p>To make this film <i>verifiably</i> notable, you must describe what is notable about it in the article - what separates it from the hundreds of other films released every week. As you have said (and I personally believe it is true), this film <i>is</i> somewhat notable. I am not saying it is definitely notable enough to avoid deletion, but it has a chance.</p>
<p>Now, the trouble is, you cannot simply state in the article "it's notable because of X and Y and Z" - you must also back up statement X with at least one quote from a <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVER_2bf3.html" title="WP:VER">verifiable source</a> - a reputable book, or a newspaper, or a media source, etc. - but not a blog, a forum or unknown website. Bangladeshi sources are fine, so long as they are trustworthy ones. The quote will show the reader that X has <i>also</i> been said by someone notable. This makes X something the reader can trust. And you must back up Y, Z and so on the same way.</p>
<p>This is the approach Wikipedia wants, because Wikipedia does <i>not</i> allow <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. Original research includes people saying "X and Y and Z" in an article without any evidence to back it up. Not good, because it means people could just make up anything they liked.</p>
<p>So, if you can find some media sources and quotes to put into the article that back up your claims about the film - first, that the situation for Bangladeshi women in general is how you state it, second, that Bangladeshi film actresses are not treated favourably, and third, that public and/or critical reaction in Bangladesh to <i>Booty</i> was positive, the way you describe it in the article, then that would be very good news. You don't need to create a perfect article. No one is expecting that. You just need to show that what you say has also been said at least once somewhere by someone notable. That's all. If you do that, I think you will get a few <b>Keeps</b> in AfD.</p>
<p>If you have these sources already, but do not know how to insert them into the article, I can help with that. But sadly I cannot help with finding the sources myself. I have looked online, and I couldn't find any. But if you need help with editing them into the article, reply on the article discussion page, and I will do what I can. I am watching the article, so I will see if you post there. BTW, it's better to post there about editing the article than in AfD, because it annoys the admins to post too much discussion in AfD, and the discussion is now too long. But you can still post questions about the deletion process etc. in AfD, of course.</p>
<p>Finally, again re "whose standards" - it is obviously going to be harder to make a porn film seem "notable", compared to the average Christina Aguilera album, because Aguilera is already a verified notable star, whereas the average porn star - which includes Jazmin, because we have no verifiable information about her on Wikipedia - isn't. But that shouldn't discourage you from trying.</p>
<p>If you find the sources in the next day or two, I think the article has a chance of survival. Good luck. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 07:12, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you so very much. This is what I have found to be greatest strenght of wikipaedia - the oneness of attitude. I really hope there would be someone out there who would take notice, cut through the crap and come up with solidly useful solutions. Thanks again. I think I have a direction now.

<dd>No problem, good luck with the changes and remember to post a comment <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Log_2006_June_23_877d.html#Bangladesh_Booty" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Log/2006 June 23">back at AfD</a> when you have made changes, so that people can check out the article and maybe reconsider their position. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 10:09, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Oh, and I forgot to mention - if there were users in the AfD who said <b>Delete</b> and you think they may reconsider their verdict based on the new version of the article, remember to leave a note and a link on their user discussion pages, politely encouraging them to go back and maybe take another look. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 10:30, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Please understand that it was nothing personal (though I can understand why you may have believed it to be) and I hope to find a moment to answer your well-presented questions. In the meanwhile, I am quite happy to let the pictures stand and I apologise also for not acting quickly enough to prevent their initial removal. I hope you have no hard feelings. I certainly harbour no hard feelings toward you. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 15:12, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This image (Image:Riya Style1.jpg) is marked for deletion. It's a film screenshot and is not being used to provide critical commentary on the film. Additionally, it is a copyrighted image and so fails <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">WP:FUC</a>'s first criteria. Only freely-licensed images may be used to depict living people. Also, you need to provide a hand-written fair-use rationale for any use of a copyrighted image on the Wikipedia, though in this case it is irrelevant as it is being used to depict a living person, thus will always fail <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">WP:FUC</a>. Note that <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">WP:FUC</a>'s wording has changed recently.

<p>You said: "Hey dude, I have added a fair use rationale for the biopic on the article <a href="../../../r/i/y/Riya_Sen_d5a8.html" title="Riya Sen">Riya Sen</a>. Please take a look at it. And, oh, since I have removed the deletion tage from the image as advised on the tags (i.e. the tags mat be removed if provided with a fair use rational), I also have removed the line from the article page that says the image is scheduled for deletion. I also have changed the licensing information from screenshot to fair use in Riya Sen and Style (film). I also have looked for another image to be used (yes, using <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">google</a>), and have done so. Well I admit that it didn't vary much, if any, in source and copyright status from the earlier one. But, I think before there is a replacable picture available it may stand. Please, check and advise."</p>
<dl>
<dd>I already responded prior to this message, but just to be clear... <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">WP:FUC</a> prohibits the use of a fair-use image to depict a living person, so this still fails the criteria. We can't wait until a replacement image is provided, that's not sufficient grounds under <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">WP:FUC</a>. Additionally, this is a film screenshot so we cannot use a different license. And given that, we are not using the image to provide critical commentary on the film but rather, just to illustrate an actress. It still violates the license. I know you are working hard here and you definitely are editing in good faith, but the image still violates WP:FUC. Please feel free to ask for more detailed explanations. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 18:41, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(In response to your comments) They have not been noticed. There are in fact a large number of similar images currently in violation. It takes time to track them all down and tag them. <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">WP:FUC</a> was tightened up recently. It used to be permitted to use a fair-use (non-freely licensed) image to depict a living person (with appropriate rationale). This is no longer the case. As to what "replaceable" means, it really comes down to whether it would be reasonable for someone (not necessarily <i>you</i>) to create a free image. For example, <i>you</i> may not own a particular car but if this car is or was sold, someone else may and could take an image. <i>You</i> may not be able to take a free image of a living person but someone else certainly could. In both cases, the fair-use image is replaceable. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 19:02, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>(In response to your comments) Why does 1 not apply? Is the person dead? If so, I apologise. But if the person is still alive, criteria 1 most definitely applies. "No free equivalent is available or could be created that would adequately give the same information. [...] However, if the subject of the photograph still exists, a freely-licensed photograph could be taken." If the person is still alive, the subject of the photograph still exists and a free equivalent "could be created that would adequately give the same information" (in this case, what the person looks like) simply by having someone take a picture of her, or having her agent release a promotional image under a free license. As to having the image replaced within the time, this follows from the current image violating <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">WP:FUC</a> so therefore, see the non-compliance section in WP:FUC. Images that fail WP:FUC must be deleted within 48 hours or 7 days, depending. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 19:30, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>(In response to your comments) Yes, it does. "However, if the subject of the photograph still exists, a freely-licensed photograph could be taken." A living person is a subject of the photograph that still exists. A dead person would be a subject of a photograph that no longer exists. I agree that it is not spelled out explicitly but I assure you this is how it is meant to be understood. As to your other point, that you are not using the image merely to show what she looks like, I disagree. The image is in the page's infobox and thus is definitely showing only what she looks like. If it was <i>not</i> in the infobox but instead was attached to a paragraph discussing that particular movie and that paragraph made specific note of what the character looked like, then it would be an example of an image not being used solely to depict the person. As of now, though, it is not attached to any such paragraph and in fact the article makes only passing reference to that movie. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 19:50, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>(In response to your comments) I have not tried taking a picture of any celebrity, actually, but I have worked with some celebrities and non-celebrities to get a freely-licensed image for use on the Wikipedia. None of them were Bollywood actors or actresses, however. As to the infobox, these are used to provide basic information and to depict what the person looks like. If an image is to be used to provide critical commentary on a film, it needs to be attached to a paragraph providing that critical commentary. Often, an image which was attached to a paragraph and was fair-use there is moved up to the infobox but then must subsequently be removed for exactly this reason. Some of this stuff, unfortunately, is not explicitly spelled out. Other times, we try to spell something out (criteria #1 of WP:FUC) but people understandably read it differently than was intended. And then what about a situation where, say, the person is still alive but is in hiding? They still exist so a <i>strict</i> reading of #1 says we cannot use a fair-use image of them. But it's not reasonable to create a replacement. Now, try to write out a clear policy that will take <i>all</i> of these crazy situations into account, and you can see the problems. In the end, the only way to really go about things is with discussions like this, even though they take time. And thanks for noting the other image problems. I'll try to mark at least some of them when I have a moment.--<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 20:41, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sorry to butt into the conversation, but I think it is better to have a bad quality free-licensed image than to have a great-looking non-free image-under FU. If a person is alive, sooner or later, a photo will be available. An example is <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunil_Gangopadhyay_2fc7.html" title="Sunil Gangopadhyay">Sunil Gangopadhyay</a>, whom I met last month during a programme, and the photos I took were uploaded to commons, to be used in various WPs. If there is no pic yet at commons, then perhaps it is better to have no pic at all. Many other ventures have gotten into trouble due to copyright problems, and we need to be extremely careful about that. My 2 cents.&#160;:) --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 22:23, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please, take a look, and let me know - why the image of Riya Sen from Style the movie was less of a fair use image than msot of these.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Riya Sen</span></h2>
<p>Hey Aditya. Glad to see your level of activity on WP. Regarding the points you made about the <a href="../../../r/i/y/Riya_Sen_d5a8.html" title="Riya Sen">Riya Sen</a> article, I removed the links to the languages, because its Wikipedia policy to wikilink a word only once in an article. Since the words <b>Hindi</b> and <b>Malayalam</b> appear earlier in the article, I don't wikilink them a second time. This prevents an excessive number of wikilinks, which would make reading the article difficult.</p>
<p>As for the picture, please feel free to replace the one I have with a better one. The only problem is that copyright rules are pretty stringent, so the best option is to get posters or screenshots, crop her head out, and lower the resolution so it satisfies the fair use laws. I decided on this one because this was a shot that was in keeping with her image, but if you find a better one, go ahead and upload it - just be sure to replace the old one rather than uploading a new one, otherwise there's a huge excess of unused pictures.</p>
<p>I also made a couple of changes to the external links you added - I redirected the link to the relevant section. Also, I removed one of the other two external links since they point to very similar articles. Another thing I did was to the page on the Ganguly brothers - a small point but very important. Please make sure that all titles and sub-headings use lowercase letters except for the first letter and proper nouns. Otherwise Wikipedia links get very confused. In fact, if you find a page with too many capital letters, please go ahead and change it. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamesmasterg9_099f.html" title="User:Gamesmasterg9">Gamesmaster G-9</a> 16:53, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am not on Wikipedia enough to do the changes. However, if you notice there are articles about band members from regional bands that are not really known world-wide. The examples are numerous. The question of how well-known is well-known enough for WP is a tough one&#160;;-).

The second issue is with the article <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artcell.html" title="Artcell">Artcell</a> itself. I am having trouble seeing what you want. Could you just go ahead and do the edits? If I disagree, I'll edit and we'll get somewhere. Just a request: try not to REMOVE information. If the wording is bad, sure, change it, but I don't want to lose information that someone gathered.

<dd>I assure you it won't be an edit war. It will be constructive editing to improve the article. I am quite aware of Wikipedia's various so-called "standards" and my personal opinion on the matter is, there is no reason to believe that the creators of these "standards" are super-human. The standards are their compromised <i>opinion</i> and more often than not major flaws show up where two standards contradict. (Check out the war about Kolkata versus Calcutta that took place a few months ago.) Once again, I need to know exactly what you are complaining about to know what is wrong.

<dd>As far as your liking Artcell goes, not everyone likes everything. A band like <a href="../../../d/r/e/Dream_Theater_3270.html" title="Dream Theater">Dream Theater</a> or <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queensryche.html" title="Queensryche">Queensryche</a> will be called seminal and will make history and will yet sell fewer records in their lifetime than just-another-pop-singer, like <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britney_Spears_3573.html" title="Britney Spears">Britney Spears</a>, will sell over a few years. I am not comparing Artcell to these great Progressive Metal innovators, but I am saying is what you or I think hardly matters. They have a fan-base and their current popularity is fairly easy to guage. <a href="../../../u/r/n/User%7EUrnonav_4b88.html" title="User:Urnonav">urnonav</a> 08:33, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You removed the redirects in the Private Universities in Bangladesh substubs. I recommend you either write some content or put the redirects back, else someone will delete them speedily under CSD A3. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small>2006-12-15 19:58Z</small></i></span></p>

<dd>Thanks for your concern. But, instead of misleading people off to a list of schools in Bangladesh, which is only related to the subjects redirected, why don't you do it the honest way, and write on the universities yourself? These subversive techniques to keep shoddy contributions out of the editors will achieve nothing but more hassle for them. Remember, everyone works for free here, and no one deserves that extra hassle. I have tried to comply to your request and attended to 9-10 of those empty entries. But, I guess, it's time that <a href="../../../n/a/h/User%7ENAHID_6918.html" title="User:NAHID">User:NAHID</a>, who created those entries, and you, who tried to hide them from the editors, get your hands dirty. And, oh, some of those entries do deserve a deletion (no notability and such). Thanks again. I'm sure your contributions will make WP a better and more knowledgeable place. - <a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAditya_Kabir_e8b8.html" title="User:Aditya Kabir">Aditya Kabir</a> 15:49, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Apologies</b>: I had to come back and write again. Sorry, that I was irritated at your suggestion. I know that you've been trying hard and working harder. But, that redirect trick was still unacceptable (you ought to know better). And, I'm sure you'll agree that overzealous creation of entries after entries on hardly-notable topics should be encouraged or protected. If these entries go deleted, that may be hard on the user, but not WP at all. Thanks.

<dd>Thanks for writing stubs for some of them. I'm not sure why you think a redirect is a "dishonest trick"? It is actually a very good, honest, useful trick. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small>2006-12-16 21:58Z</small></i></span></dd>

<dd><b>Explanation</b>. I think redirecting an <i>empty entry</i> (an entry that doesn't have single word written) symbolizes sloppy contribution and making others do my bidding. It should not be protected as such. If necessary, the contributor can re-create the entries, if they get deleted, and at least make a stub. Besides, I believe that editors (that includes you too) have a job already hard enough without having to find out which redirects are real and which are just there to protect someone's sloppy work. <i>Dishonesty</i> may be too strong a word used out of frustration, but I still think this trick does the original over-zealous contributor any good.<br />
Everyone should learn the WP ways by learning the obstacles, not by being pampered. That, of course, is my personal opinion only. I am learning it the hard way, and I see even editors bear pretty funny ideas on what's proper and what's not. Let's not encourage ignorance through our li'll <i>tricks</i>. - <a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAditya_Kabir_e8b8.html" title="User:Aditya Kabir">Aditya Kabir</a> 08:24, 17 December 2006 (UTC) (P.S.

<p>Hello, perhaps you have this figured out by now, but we cannot have empty articles lying about. Articles that only contain templates (such as {{<a href="../../../p/r/i/Template%7EPrivate_Universities_of_Bangladesh_d7f9.html" title="Template:Private Universities of Bangladesh">Private Universities of Bangladesh</a>}}) are considered empty and can be deleted on sight. And redirects are used so that if a person searches for a school, it goes to a list rather than saying we don't have an article on that. If you want to write articles on the individual schools, go ahead.
