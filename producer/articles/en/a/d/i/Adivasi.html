<p>Tribal peoples constitute 8.3 % of the nation's total population, over 84 million people according to the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a> census. One concentration lives in a belt along the <a href="../../../h/i/m/Himalaya.html" title="Himalaya">Himalayas</a> stretching through <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jammu_and_Kashmir_d1bc.html" title="Jammu and Kashmir">Jammu and Kashmir</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/m/Himachal_Pradesh_a421.html" title="Himachal Pradesh">Himachal Pradesh</a>, and <a href="../../../u/t/t/Uttarakhand.html" title="Uttarakhand">Uttarakhand</a> in the west, to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assam.html" title="Assam">Assam</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/g/Meghalaya.html" title="Meghalaya">Meghalaya</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tripura.html" title="Tripura">Tripura</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/u/Arunachal_Pradesh_3e97.html" title="Arunachal Pradesh">Arunachal Pradesh</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/z/Mizoram.html" title="Mizoram">Mizoram</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manipur.html" title="Manipur">Manipur</a>, and <a href="../../../n/a/g/Nagaland.html" title="Nagaland">Nagaland</a> in the northeast. In the northeastern states of Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Nagaland, upward of 90 % of the population is tribal. However, in the remaining northeast states of Assam, Manipur, Sikkim, and Tripura, tribal peoples form between 20 and 30 % of the population.</p>
<p>Another concentration lives in the hilly areas of central India (<a href="../../../c/h/h/Chhattisgarh.html" title="Chhattisgarh">Chhattisgarh</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madhya_Pradesh_a149.html" title="Madhya Pradesh">Madhya Pradesh</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/i/Orissa.html" title="Orissa">Orissa</a>, and, to a lesser extent, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andhra_Pradesh_0379.html" title="Andhra Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a>); in this belt, which is bounded by the <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narmada_River_edcb.html" title="Narmada River">Narmada River</a> to the north and the <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godavari_River_3bbc.html" title="Godavari River">Godavari River</a> to the southeast, tribal peoples occupy the slopes of the region's mountains. Other tribals, including the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santals.html" title="Santals">Santals</a>, live in <a href="../../../j/h/a/Jharkhand.html" title="Jharkhand">Jharkhand</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Bengal_be5b.html" title="West Bengal">West Bengal</a>. Central Indian states have the country's largest tribes, and, taken as a whole, roughly 75 % of the total tribal population live there, although the tribal population there accounts for only around 10 % of the region's total population.</p>
<p>There are smaller numbers of tribal people in <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karnataka.html" title="Karnataka">Karnataka</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamil_Nadu_d7a5.html" title="Tamil Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a>, and <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kerala.html" title="Kerala">Kerala</a> in <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_India_4a4b.html" title="South India">south India</a>; in western India in <a href="../../../g/u/j/Gujarat.html" title="Gujarat">Gujarat</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/j/Rajasthan.html" title="Rajasthan">Rajasthan</a>, and in the union territories of <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lakshadweep.html" title="Lakshadweep">Lakshadweep</a> and the <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andaman_Islands_f6c9.html" title="Andaman Islands">Andaman Islands</a> and <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicobar_Islands_a1f3.html" title="Nicobar Islands">Nicobar Islands</a>.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/i/Adivasi.html" title="Edit section: Criteria of 'Tribalness'">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Criteria of 'Tribalness'</span></h2>
<p>Apart from the use of strictly legal criteria, however, the problem of determining which groups and individuals are tribal is both subtle and complex. Because it concerns economic interests and voting blocs, the question of who are members of Scheduled Tribes rather than <a href="../../../o/t/h/Other_Backward_Class_9fc8.html" title="Other Backward Class">Backward Classes</a> or <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dalit_%28outcaste%29.html" title="Dalit (outcaste)">Scheduled Castes</a> is often controversial.</p>
<p>A number of traits have customarily been seen as establishing tribal rather than caste identity. These include language, social organization, religious affiliation, economic patterns, geographic location, and self-identification. Recognized tribes typically live in hilly regions somewhat remote from caste settlements; they generally speak a language recognized as tribal.</p>
<p>Unlike castes, which form part of a complex and interrelated local economic exchange system, tribes tend to form self-sufficient economic units. For most tribal people, land-use rights traditionally derive simply from tribal membership. Tribal society tends to the egalitarian, with its <a href="../../../l/e/a/Leadership.html" title="Leadership">leadership</a> based on ties of kinship and personality rather than on hereditary status. Tribes typically consist of <a href="../../../s/e/g/Segmentary_lineage.html" title="Segmentary lineage">segmentary lineages</a> whose extended families provide the basis for social organization and control. Tribal religion recognizes no authority outside the tribe.</p>
<p>Any of these criteria may not apply in specific instances. Language does not always give an accurate indicator of tribal or caste status. Especially in regions of mixed population, many tribal groups have lost their mother tongues and simply speak local or regional languages. In parts of Assam - an area historically divided between warring tribes and villages - increased contact among villagers began during the colonial period, and has accelerated since independence in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a>. A pidgin <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assamese_language.html" title="Assamese language">Assamese</a> developed while educated tribal members learned Hindi and, in the late twentieth century, English.</p>
<p>Self-identification and group loyalty do not provide unfailing markers of tribal identity either. In the case of stratified tribes, the loyalties of clan, kin, and family may well predominate over those of tribe. In addition, tribes cannot always be viewed as people living apart; the degree of isolation of various tribes has varied tremendously. The Gonds, Santals, and Bhils traditionally have dominated the regions in which they have lived. Moreover, tribal society is not always more egalitarian than the rest of the rural populace; some of the larger tribes, such as the Gonds, are highly stratified.</p>
<p>The apparently wide fluctuation in estimates of South Asia's tribal population through the twentieth century gives a sense of how unclear the distinction between tribal and nontribal can be. India's <a href="../../../1/9/3/1931.html" title="1931">1931</a> census enumerated 22 million tribal people, in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a> only 10 million were counted, but by <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a> some 30 million and in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a> nearly 68 million tribal members were included. The differences among the figures reflect changing census criteria and the economic incentives individuals have to maintain or reject classification as a tribal member.</p>
<p>These gyrations of census data serve to underline the complex relationship between caste and tribe. Although, in theory, these terms represent different ways of life and ideal types, in reality they stand for a continuum of social groups. In areas of substantial contact between tribes and castes, social and cultural pressures have often tended to move tribes in the direction of becoming castes over a period of years. Tribal peoples with ambitions for social advancement in Indian society at large have tried to gain the classification of caste for their tribes. On occasion, an entire tribe or part of a tribe joined a Hindu sect and thus entered the caste system <i>en masse</i>. If a specific tribe engaged in practices that Hindus deemed polluting, the tribe's status when it was assimilated into the caste hierarchy would be affected.</p>
<p>Since independence, however, the special benefits available to Scheduled Tribes have convinced many groups, even Hindus and Muslims, that they will enjoy greater advantages if so designated. The schedule gives tribal people incentives to maintain their identity. By the same token, the schedule also includes a number of groups whose 'tribal' status, in cultural terms, is dubious at best.</p>

<p>Tribal are not part of caste system, This is a eglitarian society. Christian tribals do not automatically lose their traditional tribal rules. When in 1891 a missionary asked 150 Munda Christians to inter-dine with people of different rank, only 20 Christians did so, and many converts lost their new faith. Father Haghenbeek concluded on this episode that these rules are not "pagan", but a sign of "national sentiment and pride", and wrote: “On the contrary, while proclaiming the equality of all men before God, we now tell them: preserve your race pure, keep your customs, refrain from eating with Lohars (blacksmiths), Turis (bamboo workers) and other people of lower rank. To become good Christians, it (inter-dining) is not required.”<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="Education" id="Education"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/i/Adivasi.html" title="Edit section: Education">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Education</span></h2>
<p>Extending the system of primary education into tribal areas and reserving places for tribal children in middle and high schools and higher education institutions are central to government policy, but efforts to improve a tribe's educational status have had mixed results. Recruitment of qualified teachers and determination of the appropriate language of instruction also remain troublesome. Commission after commission on the "language question" has called for instruction, at least at the primary level, in the students' native tongue. In some regions, tribal children entering school must begin by learning the official regional language, often one completely unrelated to their tribal tongue.</p>
<p>Many tribal schools are plagued by high dropout rates. Children attend for the first three to four years of primary school and gain a smattering of knowledge, only to lapse into illiteracy later. Few who enter continue up to the tenth grade; of those who do, few manage to finish high school. Therefore, very few are eligible to attend institutions of higher education, where the high rate of attrition continues. Members of agrarian tribes like the Gonds often are reluctant to send their children to school, needing them, they say, to work in the fields. On the other hand, in those parts of the northeast where tribes have generally been spared the wholesale onslaught of outsiders, schooling has helped tribal people to secure political and economic benefits. The education system there has provided a corps of highly trained tribal members in the professions and high-ranking administrative posts.</p>
<p><a name="Economy" id="Economy"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/d/i/Adivasi.html" title="Edit section: Economy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>
<p>Most tribes are concentrated in heavily forested areas that combine inaccessibility with limited political or economic significance. Historically, the economy of most tribes was subsistence agriculture or hunting and gathering. Tribal members traded with outsiders for the few necessities they lacked, such as <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salt.html" title="Salt">salt</a> and <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron.html" title="Iron">iron</a>. A few local Hindu craftsmen might provide such items as cooking utensils.</p>
<p>In the early <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a>, however, large areas fell into the hands of non-tribals, on account of improved transportation and communications. Around <a href="../../../1/9/0/1900.html" title="1900">1900</a>, many regions were opened by the government to settlement through a scheme by which inward migrants received ownership of land free in return for cultivating it. For tribal people, however, land was often viewed as a common resource, free to whoever needed it. By the time tribals accepted the necessity of obtaining formal land titles, they had lost the opportunity to lay claim to lands that might rightfully have been considered theirs. The colonial and post-independence regimes belatedly realized the necessity of protecting tribals from the predations of outsiders and prohibited the sale of tribal lands. Although an important loophole in the form of land leases was left open, tribes made some gains in the mid-twentieth century, and some land was returned to tribal peoples despite obstruction by local police and land officials.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970s</a>, tribal peoples came again under intense land pressure, especially in central India. Migration into tribal lands increased dramatically, as tribal people lost title to their lands in many ways – lease, forfeiture from debts, or bribery of land registry officials. Other non-tribals simply squatted, or even lobbied governments to classify them as tribal to allow them to compete with the formerly established tribes. In any case, many tribal members became landless labourers in the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960s</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970s</a>, and regions that a few years earlier had been the exclusive domain of tribes had an increasingly mixed population of tribals and non-tribals. Government efforts to evict nontribal members from illegal occupation have proceeded slowly; when evictions occur at all, those ejected are usually members of poor, lower castes.</p>
<p>Improved communications, roads with motorized traffic, and more frequent government intervention figured in the increased contact that tribal peoples had with outsiders. Commercial highways and cash crops frequently drew non-tribal people into remote areas. By the 1960s and 1970s, the resident nontribal shopkeeper was a permanent feature of many tribal villages. Since shopkeepers often sell goods on credit (demanding high interest), many tribal members have been drawn deeply into debt or mortgaged their land. Merchants also encourage tribals to grow cash crops (such as cotton or castor-oil plants), which increases tribal dependence on the market for basic necessities. Indebtedness is so extensive that although such transactions are illegal, traders sometimes 'sell' their debtors to other merchants, much like indentured peons.</p>
<p>The final blow for some tribes has come when nontribals, through political jockeying, have managed to gain legal tribal status, that is, to be listed as a Scheduled Tribe.</p>
<p>Tribes in the Himalayan foothills have not been as hard-pressed by the intrusions of non-tribals. Historically, their political status was always distinct from the rest of India. Until the British colonial period, there was little effective control by any of the empires centered in peninsular India; the region was populated by autonomous feuding tribes. The British, in efforts to protect the sensitive northeast frontier, followed a policy dubbed the "Inner Line"; nontribal people were allowed into the areas only with special permission. Postindependence governments have continued the policy, protecting the Himalayan tribes as part of the strategy to secure the border with China.</p>
<p>Government policies on forest reserves have affected tribal peoples profoundly. Government efforts to reserve forests have precipitated armed (if futile) resistance on the part of the tribal peoples involved. Intensive exploitation of forests has often meant allowing outsiders to cut large areas of trees (while the original tribal inhabitants were restricted from cutting), and ultimately replacing mixed forests capable of sustaining tribal life with single-product plantations. Nontribals have frequently bribed local officials to secure effective use of reserved forest lands.</p>
<p>The northern tribes have thus been sheltered from the kind of exploitation that those elsewhere in South Asia have suffered. In Arunachal Pradesh (formerly part of the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North-East_Frontier_Agency_bf80.html" title="North-East Frontier Agency">North-East Frontier Agency</a>), for example, tribal members control commerce and most lower-level administrative posts. Government construction projects in the region have provided tribes with a significant source of cash. Some tribes have made rapid progress through the education system (the role of early missionaries was significant in this regard). Instruction was begun in Assamese but was eventually changed to Hindi; by the early 1980s, English was taught at most levels. Northeastern tribal people have thus enjoyed a certain measure of social mobility.</p>
