<p>Thank you, I appreciate the comments. I will review the guidelines once more. I've tried to stay as cool as possible when attacked -- it is clear that I did not start it.

<dd>Certainly - I placed it in my response today: "Also, I’d like to ask for everyone to be constructive as well as, refrain from making insulting remarks like “what an big time idiot a person has to be” or “to show the real stupidity of Mr. Baguirov” as Mr. Doostzadeh has done more than once".</dd>

<dd>Here's the full quote of his written at 10:36, 25 May 2006 (UTC) on the Nezami talk page: "15). Mr. Adil Baguirov repeats the same statement about Shirin like a parrot! But the fact of the matter is that I brought verses from other poets that consider Shirin as an Armenian. Indeed there is no mention of Turan or Afrasiyaab in the Khusraw o Shirin! Mr. Baguirov is a liar. For the rest of his statements also he can not bring the relavent verses. From example about nomadic horse milk, where is the verse? Where is the verse about Afrasiyaab? Where is the verse about Turan in Khusraw o Shirin? . And to show the real stupidity of Mr. Baguirov, it is well known that Shirin [6] was a Christian and not some Shamanistic horse milk drinker." He did later delete it -- in general, he does a lot of revisions and such tactics make a fair debate hard, but it is saved here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Nezami&amp;oldid=55047097" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Nezami&amp;oldid=55047097" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Nezami&amp;oldid=55047097</a> --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">AdilBaguirov</a> 05:43, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
I'd like to also note that I refuted every single statement of that person, especially stemming from this paragraph (e.g., Shirin being Armenian, Afrasiyab not being the ancestor of Shirin and Mahin-Banu, milk being an important part of diet of Shirin, Shirin not being Christian, etc.)</p>
<p>I wish I could have a purely scholarly debate, but my opponent is not interested in such, and uses all tactics at his disposal -- from unwarranted insults to belittling to outright misquotes and falsifications. Unlike him, I actually document all such false statements and prove why they are such and not just some propaganda slur. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">AdilBaguirov</a> 05:48, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ok, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ali_doostzadeh&amp;diff=56269863&amp;oldid=56068931" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ali_doostzadeh&amp;diff=56269863&amp;oldid=56068931" rel="nofollow">warned</a>. Are there any compromises you could think of with the user? —<span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi"><font color="">Khoikhoi</font></a></span> 05:51, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Thank you. There are three ways -- I) we can either exclude everything that any of the knowledgeable parties object -- which probably 1) means only myself and Mr. Doostzadeh as the most knowledgeable and persons who invested most time, and 2) it also means the article might have much less information.</p>
<p>II) We include almost everything we want, by having one pro-Iran version for every pro-Azerbaijan version of the article.</p>
<p>III) We negotiate and agree, line-by-line, on the content and I would like to insist on a third-party moderator(s) involvement.</p>
<p>In all three variants, locking the page might be a good idea.</p>
<p>The page the way it is (without my edits -- as they keep on reverting them) makes little sense, as 1) it is completely one sided and pro-Iranian despite mentioning Azerbaijan pro forma and 2) they intentionally include contentious and false information, such as on Shirin being Armenian.</p>
<p>By the way, I can take the current page as a basis and make all the corrections as I see fit, while being as rational and unbiased as possible, that is not being one-sided and admitting everything that needs to be admitted. I believe that my view of Nizami as one of the greatest Persian language poets who belongs to both Azerbaijan and Iran culturally and historically, and can be celebrated as a dual-nationality poet -- much like many other poets, such as Rudaki, Jami or Ferdowsi -- should please most on both sides of the wire. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">AdilBaguirov</a> 06:32, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Those are good suggestions. In regards to Shirin, I suggest something like, "some sourds say she was Armenian, others Azerbaijani". And perhaps we could remove the quotes section all together. How does that sound? —<span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi"><font color="">Khoikhoi</font></a></span> 05:19, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dear Khoikhoi, thank you. Which of my edits did not fully correspond to the rules? I obviously might have not worded something the perfect way, but every single factual statement, figure, stat I can back up -- even if it's not readily available on the Web, I have those pages scanned and can easily upload to my own website for anyone's viewing or to Wikipedia.</dd>

<dd>Hi Adil. Well, the one I noticed in particular was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nagorno-Karabakh&amp;diff=57664820&amp;oldid=57653637" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nagorno-Karabakh&amp;diff=57664820&amp;oldid=57653637" rel="nofollow">this one</a>. Calling NKR "so-called" reflects a certain POV. It's like saying <i>the so-called <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_Republic_of_Northern_Cyprus_c705.html" title="Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus">Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus</a></i>. Let me give you an example of how NPOV works:</dd>

<dd>Armenian POV: <i>Nagorno-Karabakh was liberated by Armenians</i></dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Azeri POV: <i>Nagorno-Karabakh is occupied by Armenians</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Neutral point of view: <i>Nagorno-Karabakh is controlled by Armenians</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>See what I'm saying? We don't want to sway the reader to one side or the other, it's their job to decide whether it's liberation or occupation, not ours.

<dd>Thank you - I understand, and that's why I thought I did provide comments in the Talk page. Any reference to "NKR" must be preceeded either by: 1) so-called, or 2) self-styled or 3) unrecognized.

<dd>Also, TRNC cannot be so-called because it has been recognized by at least one state -- Turkey, and the latter, according to the Treaty of Guarantee, had the right to intervene in Cyprus, granted it did not happen all and fully the way proscribed, but still, TRNC, Palestine, Kosovo, and "NKR" are different. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">AdilBaguirov</a> 22:05, 9 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So what you're saying, Adil, is if Armenia recognizes the NKR (which so far as I know it hasn't, which IMO is a bit strange) then you would end your requirement to have "so-called" before the name? --<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolbez_ce9f.html" title="User:Golbez">Golbez</a> 18:20, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Technically, once even one legitimate state recognizes another entity, the latter has become de jure recognized and debuted onto the world stage, although of course there are several more important steps, such as recognition by some other states, membership in various international organizations (membership in UN is not a requirement, but very indicative of the status), and opening of diplomatic offices. Currently, so-called "NKR" is an illegitimate entity, steps below Palestine and TRNC. In regards to TRNC, don't forget that US airplanes actually flew there *directly*, and President Bush asked Secretary Rice last year to see how to make this regular. But then again, TRNC and Karabakh are different, and should be treated as such. And there are very good reasons why Armenia stoped short of recognizing "NKR" de jure, although it accorded a lot of aspects of the de jure recognition upon "NKR" (it's too lengthy and complicated to write about here). If anything, this was a masterful tactic chosen by Armenian diplomacy, which has been lead from day one by US-born or US-educated expatriats of Armenian origin.</dd>

<dd>It generally is -- and was for "NKR" from the beginning as well, when they wrote letters to President Yeltsin asking to admit them into the Russian Federation, then to CIS, etc. However, my concern is different -- all I'm saying is that the rhetoric and terminology used on that page should be in line with what other neutral, Western sources say, which means preceed all reference to so-called "NKR" with any one of the three epithets. Why would this not be a reasonable request? --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">AdilBaguirov</a> 22:30, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dear Khoikhoi, what about Azerbaijani and Turkish editors? Should we be very sensitive and appeazing to Armenian editors, and yet step all over other editors? Why? My position, as well as the position of any Azerbaijani, Turkish, Georgian, Moldovan, and other editors is based firmly on international law and on the position of the international community. Once again, this is not an "Azerbaijani view", but the view of 99% of the world, and thus it is prevailing and more accurate than the view of the dissenting Armenians. And I've also reverted a lot of their stuff - why should I compromise, whilst they should not? My position is based 100% on solid facts from ... Armenian sources! Meanwhile, those editors have nothing to put against me aside from the fact that they have been longer on Wiki (although I am on the Net since 1995, longe before many people here). The info I've include is well-known in Armenia and not really concealed, and should not be supressed by Armenian editors. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">AdilBaguirov</a> 19:23, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Salam Ali, thanks for your message. I still haven't looked at the Nizami page, I've got sidetracked for the past week. I will look tomorrow, and also hope we can put it behind us. On Tigran -- Ali, it is not my opinion or my invention, I've cited everyone, including the Father of Armenian History, Movses of Khorene, who says that, and secondary, modern sources which clearly show that even in the cities of Armenia, Armenians were in minority. At that time even ancient Armenian language, grabar, didn't exist yet! Thus, not just Tigran, but the entire Arsacid and Artaxias dynasties were Parthian, and Orontids were Persian, and bunch of other kings were either Iberian, or Atropatenian or Jewish. When all those sources say those things -- and again, many are Armenian or Armenian-friendly sources, they have no reason whatsoever to be biased or falsify anything -- that means he was Parthian. Indeed, the Parthian connection was very strong, and it should not be supressed. No one denies that these figures are related primarily to Armenia and that they were kings of Armenia. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">AdilBaguirov</a> 05:26, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

There is only some info from some chroniclers that kings of Albania and Iberia accepted Tigran's suzeiranty over them -- but in case of Albania, this can't be proven, as neither the coins, nor any other historical accounts prove that. Moreover, Tigranes was in control from only 95, not 99BC, and started his conquests about a decade later, capturing Atropatene (Azerbaijan) only in 85 BC or so, and losing everything by 69BC. Hence if anything related to Albania happened, it was during that short 15-year span - and that's easy to trace, check, verify. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">AdilBaguirov</a> 22:49, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, in the West there are a bunch of books, like by David Nissman and Brenda Shaffer which use that terminology, so do Russian/Soviet authors, and here's an example from Iranica: <a href="http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/ot_grp5/ot_archeology_viii_20040616.html" class="external free" title="http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/ot_grp5/ot_archeology_viii_20040616.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/ot_grp5/ot_archeology_viii_20040616.html</a> --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">AdilBaguirov</a> 06:04, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Adil, I understand what you're saying, but his being half Azeri or not doesn't matter. I know it might matter to you and I recommend that you write on the guy's article page that he is only purported to be half Azeri. You want the <a href="../../../a/z/e/Azeris.html" title="Azeris">Azeris</a> article to look good and make it as a featured article right? I've already written two featured articles and I think this one can make it too, but only if it is clear and doesn't have a bunch of excess information that people can read through links and other articles. Just please trust me as I've talked to the other Azeri editors and Ali as well who has been giving us more credibility with the Iranica articles that Grandmaster also recommended and I think the article is okay now.

<dd>Thanks for the quick response. I am not against Iranica articles - or including ethnicty of Mana guy. But if the alledged by Iranian government ethnicty is included, then so should the one of the Editor in Chief -- he is a much bigger fish than some cartoon drawer. Can we perhaps remove alleged ethnicty (but leave all those references and links that are there so that anyone can freely read the allegation outside the article) or include the Persian ethnicity of the editor as well? I've never seen an encyclopedia mention, for example, that Eva Brown, wife of Hitler, was Jewish, or that Hitler had several Jewish generals and even a field marshall. Stalin and Beria, both Georgians, gladly killed a lot of Georgians, but it's never really emphasized directly, in-your-face, in any respectable articles. Thanks for handling this tough job -- I know you must be splitting hairs by now. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">AdilBaguirov</a> 05:53, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Adil, that is actually interesting. I did not know Eva was half jewish. That is a great piece of information. I think it is better that at least acadmeia tells us about all facts such as above. I wonder why they have not mentioned it!</p>
<p>By the way, I am not sure what you mean by mentioning in-your-face. Is that offensive to tell someone that a so called offensive cartoon, not related to us in anyway in my opinion, is not even aimed at Azaris and was drawn by a great cartoonist of Azari origin??!!! Some people had their own agenda and were looking for soemthing to pick up on something. The cartoon made a perfect excuse. It is interesting to see how many people were made to believe that it was offensive. I wonder how many people have read the damn cartoon. <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPersian_Magi_eabf.html" title="User:Persian Magi">Persian Magi</a> 06:33, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is a bunch of info on Hitler and Jews, a very complex issue. The reason I brought it up is to show that ethnicity is irrelevant in many cases - the Turkic states fought most viciously against each other: Mongols again Timurleng against Ottomans -- all at the same time!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Meanwhile, I don't believe a cartoon can be an excuse -- first, ayatollah Khamenei accused the foreign spies -- which is ridiculous, as it was in state-owned Iran newspaper, and second, because 100,000 Tebriz residents (see the 8 min video available through Google video) cannot just assemble in an organized fashion - it had to be due to genuine outpouring of emotions and feelings, and they were brewing for several days after the publication of the cartoon, until reached critical mass. I know how this happens -- I am a witness of USSR's demise and have participated in many demonstrations and protests, so know the crowds. But anyway, my point was that the ethnicity of Mana is only alleged by a government that does not really stand for veracity, and that it doesn't matter, yet if including, the ethnicity of the editor, a much more important person, should be included too. BTW, what's worse, is that the cartoon was in the children's section. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">AdilBaguirov</a> 07:00, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It was not Iranian government who said Mana was an Azeri. They have never told us so. It was in fact Western media pointing that out first. In fact, supporters of freedom of speech and journalists are bringing that fact up. I have seen the cartoon. It was in no way about Torks.</p>
<p>I have seen the video and heard about it if not first hand, second hand. I was not trying to support Iranian government view that foriegners were involved. In fact, I believe they were not. But I doubt any of those in crowds had seen the cartoon. Unfortunately, after it was declared to be offensive, it became like a taboo to show the cartoon anywhere. People only heard about it and heard it was about Torks and how offensive it was to depict torks as a coackroach!!! That is it.</p>
<p>In fact the fact that the cartoon was in children section, makes you wonder if it was at all aimed at Torks or simply some people decided it was offensive.</p>
<p>Anyhow, it is sad to see people involved in any violence over a cartoon, be it about Mohamad or be it about Torks. I wonder when we are going to grow up and not accept the offense in cartoons by being offended by them. <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPersian_Magi_eabf.html" title="User:Persian Magi">Persian Magi</a> 08:11, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi again Adil. Regarding Latin alphabet taught in Iran, they are taught for English usage only. Believe me reading Azeri in Latin alphabet is never easy for me whereas reading poems such as those of Shahriar in Persian script is far easier for me, even without all the vowels. (We only use accents for vowels in the first or second grade and the books do not have it at all apart from Quran and some Arabic sources). Regards, <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPersian_Magi_eabf.html" title="User:Persian Magi">Persian Magi</a> 06:33, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The difference between English Latin and Azerbaijani Latin is minimal, only a few letters. Just like there are German, French, Spanish Latin characters. The reason Perso-Arabic script is easier for you than Latin is because of habit. When Latin alphabet was re-introduced in Azerbaijan in 1991, the older generation -- for example, my relatives -- had hard time, but that mainly either because some didn't remember any foreign languages (they studied German during WWII or French, and forgot since), or because Azerbaijan was in such a difficult situation, that simply could not print enough books, materials, buy equipment, organize a better media campaign, etc. Meanwhile, all the younger people, as well as those who knew English or Latin-based languages, had no problem. My view -- each Azerbaijani should know at least 3 alphabets -- Latin (both Azerbaijani and prevalent English), Cyrillic (both Azerbaijani and Russian), and Arabic (esp. Perso-Arabic script). Hopefully, this will become true after the ongoing reforms in education sector. But anyway, the Latin alphabet of Azerbaijan is clearly best for representing the Azerbaijani language, and due to being simpler than Arabic, contributed to 99% literacy (Iran still have only 80%), and in computer age, Latin is also best. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">AdilBaguirov</a> 06:48, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Literacy rate is usually due to other factors. Alphabet is the last factor to blame. That is what Ata-Turk made Turks to believe; but look at their literacy rate compared to Chinese and Japanese. Japanese characters are one of the most difficult to learn characters and their literacy rate is 100%. In fact, you would not believe how they utilize technology in every aspect of their life and they do not replace anything with their valuable culutre. <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPersian_Magi_eabf.html" title="User:Persian Magi">Persian Magi</a> 08:34, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Look, Adil, as far as I know the Urartians are descendants of the Armenians. Whether they spoken Indo-European or Caucasian languages is a matter of debate. I honestly don't care what Britannica has to say (I don't see them as a reliable source, especially in regard to their treatment of the Armenian Genocide which they refer to as only "massacres"). What I do know for certain (and there are plenty of references that back this up), is that as the Urartian Empire fell, they merged with another local tribe called the Armens. The mix between both peoples led to the creation of the modern-day Armenian people (and eventually led to the establishment of the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Armenia_f6ff.html" title="Kingdom of Armenia">Kingdom of Armenia</a> and the <a href="../../../o/r/o/Orontid_Dynasty_e6f9.html" title="Orontid Dynasty">Orontid Dynasty</a>).

<dd>Pejman47 is your socketpuppet, and I've been at Wikipedia longer than you, so am better familiar with rules. It was not me, but you who have been found of breaking the 3RR rule on the M.E.Rasulzade page just earlier this month! So please take your own advice and re-read the rules, as well as take a more constructive and non-confrontational approach. I've outlined everything in the Talk page of the M.E.Rasulzade, and you have ignored it, resorting to various unilateral actions. This is not a place for that. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">AdilBaguirov</a> 00:29, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>1) Pejman47 never edited the page before - didn't have it on his "watch"; 2) He made the reverse almost the same time 23:29, January 24, 2007, as you posted to my Talk page; 3) He never left any comments in the Talk page, despite obviously needing to do that. Nor did he justify why he rv to any particular version; 4) You've been reprimanded by Wikipedia for violating the 3RR rule on the very same M.E.Rasulzade page just earlier this month -- you reverted it 4 times in 24 hours. So I guess you learned from your mistake, and asked your alter ego "Pejman" to help out. Please don't use socketpuppets in the future, don't harass people with 3RR notices, and be constructive, not acusationalist. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">AdilBaguirov</a> 00:52, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>You must be confusing me with another person sir, I did not say you were working with a political party, but political parties, quite frankly, I think it is different. As for virtual identities, for over 6 years, I have used the same alias here and everywhere else. I have also changed emails so many times that I don’t remember which one is the last and 2/3 of the times I forget the password. Because I get blackmails, threats(including death threats), including from your compatriots presenting list of names, which allegedly I am, not so long ago, such name was provided on Wikipedia in a talkpage to threaten me and force me out from here. But I am still honest enough to use the same alias. So Sir., when individuals like Sedat Laciner who happens to have published your crap in his newspaper, or Tabib who’s think thank is related with political parties on Azerbaijan are involved, I think I have the right to protect my back by filling my own investigation. One must be blind to not see something fishy is going on, new socks appears supporting already existing members, and who are allegedly new members and who know already all the policies, Wikipedia codes, administrators to contact, articles talk page contents of the last few months etc., one of those sock having appeared few hours near the same period you have restarted contributing after months of absence, and that your contribution was to revert to his change. You only reappeared with the AdilBaguirov account when I brought Dacy69 cases. It doesn’t take long to know that there is no way that some users editing the same sort of articles will vote in an interval of few minutes of a AfD of an article that they weren’t even involved ever could not be possible. When you claimed not knowing the user.</p>
<p>Oh, and it is of interest that all of the aliases I suspect being you, all know French, just like you.

<dd>Fadix, stop your insults and harrassment, as well as all those baseless allegations. As I told you, keep on "investigating" forever, I find you amuzing, to put it mildly. I've always used my name everywhere and have received more death threats and hate mail from your compatriots than you can imagine. Sedat Laciner is a Ph.D. and a good researcher, expert, which you are not. Similar with Tabib. Sorry, but still not sure about "political parties", although 1) why would this even matter in an sockpuppet allegation?! and 2) it's none of your business. What do you do, work as a junior associate for waste management company? Meanwhile, apparently both Dacy69 and Atabek are successfully countering the claims perpetrated by you and your buddies. Also, French is a very popular language and was a requirement in some schools in USSR, so no surprize there too. I understand if it would have been Swahili or even Chinese, but French? Funny. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">AdilBaguirov</a> 16:55, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>How predictible. Dude, the only reason you have your name placed there is that just like Laciner you have not credibility to lose, since you don't have any. Indeed Laciner is a good researcher, expert, who could even not answer an Armenian girl who had not much scholarity. This so professional Laciner just recently compared Dink with Talaat. So much professional indeed. But for sure, since people like both of you have the credibility so low that exposing your persona on the web could only higher it. As for Arabek and Dacy69, isen't it amazing that you bring the same BS Atabek brought? Follow contributions and you will see that there that I am even not involved with Atabek contributional articles, neither Dacy, beside his insignificant rv. which I haven't paid much attention to, except for the surprising links there are with bunch of meatpopputs and socks, today it has been confirmed that Atabek was a sock. I guess, my boddies arguments are so string that socks are indeed needed to conter them. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 21:06, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Oh and another note, having a Ph.D isen't something hard in political science really, with much of the professionalism it took to both you and Laciner to get one, this is rather a confirmation than an evidence. It is not like it is physic or neurobiology. When I think that not so long ago, it required to make a differences in a field, a real one, when as we speak calling for the defense of the thesis is enough to require the title.

<p>Just a question or thought they seem to differ?</p>
<p>From Wikipedia: Considered to be a historical capital of the Karabakh region, Shusha was one of the cultural centers of Azerbaijan. It was home to many Azerbaijani intellectuals, poets, writers and especially, musicians (e.g, the ashugs, mugham singers, kobuz players).<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> In 1977 it was declared reservation of Azerbaijan architecture and history. The city was known as the unofficial musical capital or conservatory of Transcaucasia.</p>
<p><br />
From Britannica: The people of Azerbaijan have retained their ancient musical tradition. For example, the art of ashugs, who improvise songs to their own accompaniment on a stringed instrument called a kobuz, remains extremely popular. Mugams, vocal and instrumental compositions, are also widely known, the town of Shusha being particularly renowned for this art.</p>
<p>Azerbaijan's cultural institutions, including museums, theatres, and public libraries, are located in Baku. Many of them were established after World War II. The city has museums devoted to the art, history, and literature of Azerbaijan. In Nagorno-Karabakh there is a museum with material on the history and archaeology of the Armenian people of the region. <font color="#0099FF">Nareklm</font> 21:49, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Don't understand the question -- I placed the citation to EB initially because there was a "citation needed" placed next to the first sentence of the paragraph from Wikipedia you quoted. However, decided to also add kobuz, mugham, ashugs, and thus placed the citation after the second sentence. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">AdilBaguirov</a> 22:09, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I've been quoted and written for Russian and US media too, as well as East Asian and Azerbaijani, along with Turkish, so it's a pretty international mix. But again it's a surprize for me that someone put my name in that list - but if lesser qualified people (who got their PhD's later and have less publications) are listed in Wikipedia with full-blown pages, photos, links, etc., then I don't object to my being listed too. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">AdilBaguirov</a> 18:39, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I hope you don't get offended for the sock puppet things, its just unusual how they are so similar to you, this was before i posted those, plus I've seen your sites there pretty Anti-Armenian. I have nothing against Turks or Azeris unless one or another goes to far you know what i mean.

<dd>Actually, I've got nothing anti-Armenian on my site or in my writings - bringing historic references, which show that sometimes some Armenians did bad things cannot be tantamount to being anti-Armenian. Likewise, you don't seem like a person who would blindly trust "some people" in other things -- why do you trust them in their attacks on me then? I think me posting under my name speaks volumes about me, my character and my understanding of honor and dignity. Clearly, I could have easily remained incognito, and choose myself some nickname like "Armenian" or "Melkonyan" and post under it, like what some of my critics do, but I consider that unmanly and weak, indeed, only unworthy persons do that. As of sockpuppets -- Khoikhoi is an administrator and it's easy for him to check whether this is true, or yet another baseless claim of my critic(s). What's important for me personally is that it's not me, and that I post only under my name. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">AdilBaguirov</a> 20:06, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with some things you say, but I've seen them, yes you base them on some historical reference but they are very negative for example its obvious why you're attached to Stepankert and other Armenian related articles, <a href="http://www.bakutoday.net/view.php?d=4400" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bakutoday.net/view.php?d=4400" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> Armenians have inhabited those lands for thousands of years whether it was under Russian, Turkish, Roman, Byzantine rule. Also using Udi's as puppets against Armenians, doesn't seem right or Caucasus Albanians for example I've read some Azeri scholars about what they wrote. Anyway we won't find a solution to this the edit wars would not resume we should at least give both sides, a piece of the pie. <font color="#0099FF">Nareklm</font> 20:19, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>True, but it would be best if you or another administrator read or glanced through the Talk page, and noted for themselves that the issue has been on since August 2006, and thus user Aivazovsky had more than enough time to fix everything, something which he refused to do, and only grudgingly has partially done just now without much appology for keeping the wrong information on the page for months, despite repeated notices from other users. Then, your word to Aivazovsy to be constructive and not obstructive, would be better than just protecting the page, which will be unprotected at some point anyway and things will return to usual (again, it's been going since August 2006, we have been very polite and gentle in our requests, but have been largely ignored and obstructed). --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">AdilBaguirov</a> 14:49, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Khoikhoi, nothing is clear to me -- there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever, just very unfortunate and wrongful accusations. I should not have been blocked in the first place -- not for 24 hours, and not for 72 and now 96. This is completely wrong -- especially from you, as you looked the other way when Aivazovsky violated 3RR (and that's proven, unlike allegations against me), or didn't do anything to Fadix despite his continued harrassments <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:InShaneee#Fadix" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:InShaneee#Fadix" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>. You can't extend any block without any proof -- the check user <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/AdilBaguirov" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/AdilBaguirov" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> proved that I am who I am, whilst my accusers, like Nareklm, use socks and are IP vandals <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/Nareklm" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/Nareklm" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>. If my block is extended or enacted in the first place, then an equal or more severe should be done against Nareklm. So either Nareklm should be blocked or my block lifted ASAP.</dd>

<p>Moreover, he threatened revert wars, going for IP anons: "if you guys want to play this game i will to, im not stupid i know how to find these things out, and i promise you its not going to be nice rv wars will start, im not threatening but alot of us are becoming inpatient" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Dmcdevit#Please_be_truthful_and_help" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Dmcdevit#Please_be_truthful_and_help" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></p>

Also, look who's talking -- a person with a user name "fedayee" -- fedayin, an Arabic term for some strange reason adopted by those Armenians in the quasi-military who killed innocent people, such as in Khojaly. I wonder if it's the result of so many <a href="../../../a/s/a/ASALA_768c.html" title="ASALA">ASALA</a> terrorists who came from Syria and Lebanon to kill Azerbaijanis, and brought with them the "glorious" terminology too?

<p>I have blocked Fadix for 24 hours. However, I need to remind you that remarks such as "wouldn't you rather admit that the racists here seem to be both of you" are unacceptable.

<p>Hi, Adil, i see you are blocked, never mind, I was blocked next day I created my account. I have a certain deal, what do you think, we should gather together all our arguments against panturk+panislamist accusations of <a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">User:Azerbaijani</a> and his biased sources, because as I see all our arguments are dispersed among various talkpages, and when all these dispersed arguments would be collected, I do not know how, but, some among you, experienced user would request for mediation. because this guy has a certain intention to distort azerbaijani pages, and no talkpages can stop him/her from his "activities". so i think the only way to stop it by wikipedia administration <a href="../../../e/l/s/User%7EElsanaturk_57d3.html" title="User:Elsanaturk">Elsanaturk</a> 19:29, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dmcdevit, I've written on every single page's Talk pages before, and all those comments are still there, some not answered. So I am putting back my quotes and edits that were removed during my absense -- please see it again. Also, I didn't violate Tigranes the Great page's 3RR -- I've done exactly 3 reverts, whilst the very first edit was not a revert by any stretch of measure -- it was putting in a new edit with a new reference -- all straight from the Talk page. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">AdilBaguirov</a> 21:25, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
First, user Artaxiad (aka Nareklm) reported me for an alleged 3RR violation on the Tigranes The Great page<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR&amp;oldid=109649139#User:AdilBaguirov_reported_by_User:Artaxiad_.28Result:.29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR&amp;oldid=109649139#User:AdilBaguirov_reported_by_User:Artaxiad_.28Result:.29" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>. Without properly investigating the trumped-up charge, administrator Dmcdevit seems to have jumped the gun, like a week ago, and unfairly blocked me per supposed 3RR violation -- and didn't bother to report that on the Administrators' noticeboard/3RR, under the report (perhaps because user Artaxiad then quickly erased his trumped-up charge). A quick check of the page reveals that I never broke the rule -- I did only 3 reverts, same as user Eupator who was not blocked at first despite INITIATING the reverts <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tigranes_the_Great&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tigranes_the_Great&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> (only 10 minutes AFTER I was blocked for 72 hours, the user Eupator was also blocked, but for some reason only for 48 hours<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Eupator" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Eupator" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>). In fact, user Narelmn (Artaxiad) realized the potential damage and fallout from such a deliberate wrongful accusation, and tried to remove his traces, which was noticed due to vigilance of another user, which I reproduce in full due to its well-written summary:</p>
<p>"Dear Administrators, User:Artaxiad has posted a 3RR report today, accusing User:AdilBaguirov. Although the report was false, because links under revert 2 and 3 were the same, administrator Dmcdevit blocked the user User:AdilBaguirov. Quickly after that User:Artaxiad (formerly also known as User:Nareklm caught for sockpuppetry and unpunished) has removed his false report. I have restored the report and added a comment indicating the concern, yet User:Artaxiad now started an edit war at Wikipedia 3RR reporting site reverting my comment edit. Can you please, address the issue. Below are (1) the original false 3RR report by Artaxiad, (2) Artaxiad's removal of the report after blockage of AdilBaguirov, (3) my comment, and (4) the deliberate revert of 3RR comment page by Artaxiad:</p>

<p>I would like to find out why this user Artaxiad (a.k.a. Nareklm) is given so much freedom to abuse other contributor's basic reporting and RR rights. Atabek 22:21, 20 February 2007 (UTC)" (see more: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#Reverting_of_3RR_page" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#Reverting_of_3RR_page" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>.</p>
<p>I should also stress that not only did I NOT brake the 3RR rule, but I did NOT engage in disruptive editing (e.g., no one from the community complained, except for a deliberate false charge by user Artaxiad (Nareklm), nothing in my reverts was not in full compliance with Wikipedia rules for verifiable facts, etc.), and all this would not even fall under the "electric fence" clause of the 3RR rule ("Editors may still be blocked even if they haven't made more than three edits in any given 24 hour period, if their behaviour is clearly disruptive"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:3RR" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:3RR" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>). It should also be noted that today was the first day of my editing in almost a week, and hence I simply could not have been "clearly disruptive" and warring for days, as the 3RR rule mandates ("This particularly applies to editors who persistently make three reverts each day"), in order to invoke the "electric fence" clause. I've edited all the same pages I've edited for MONTHS, on all those pages I've left extensive comments and scholarly quotes for MONTHS, whilst my opponents sometimes did not participate at all in discussions, and kept simply reverting pages despite fully-sourced and verifiable information, that has been supported and supplied by several other users.</p>
<p>Hence, I appeal to remove my unfair block immediately, and warn and otherwise reprimand those editors who have been baselessly reverting pages, thus engaging in real disruptive editing. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">AdilBaguirov</a> 02:57, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

Bear in mind that the arbitrators are not as familiar with the dispute as you and the other parties are, so the evidence has to be easy for them to follow in order to be effective. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 02:31, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Hello AdilBaguirov. This seems like a rather complex matter and I notice that there already is a <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Armenia-Azerbaijan_2091.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Armenia-Azerbaijan">arbitration</a> case filed to discuss it. I believe that there is already enough administrators looking over these various issues and the debate is already heated enough. I hope that the case closes smoothly and some resolution is reached soon.

<p>I would say it's kosher to bring it up to the Arbcom, perhaps as a simple statement of fact, or if you're really concerned, send an email to an arbitrator, not me. Perhaps send it to the recused arbitrator, since he won't be voting anyway and thus is perhaps more free to give an answer. --<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolbez_ce9f.html" title="User:Golbez">Golbez</a> 16:03, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>But the intro clearly states he was Azerbaijani, so I don't see how people could get confused. It doesn't make much sense to say he was born in Nakhichevan when it already says that in the "Life" section. That's where you're normally supposed to mention people's birth places anyways. <a href="../../../g/o/o/Googoosh.html" title="Googoosh">Googoosh</a>'s parents were from the the Azerbaijan SSR, so the intro should say "Iranian singer of Azerbaijani descent", right? Same thing, but reversed for Mamedkulizade. <tt class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoi</a><a href="../../../k/h/o/User_talk%7EKhoikhoi_f6d5.html" title="User talk:Khoikhoi">khoi</a></tt> 05:59, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Adil, you are still reverting all the time. 1RR is not an entitlement to revert once a day. Making a handful of reverts as soon as I unprotected those pages, leading to more ongoing edit wars, is unacceptable. You need to use discussion <i>instead</i> of reverts, not make unconstructive comments every time you revert just because your parole requires it. I don't think your poor behavior has changed, and it's disappointing. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 01:46, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's the behavior of my accusers which hasn't changed, as they revert en masse and remove, supress evidence. I return the pages to the condition when they present all the facts. If you block me despite not violating 1RR, you should block all others too who engage in reverts and ban all the socks like HyeProfile, Pulu-Pughi, and many others who suddenly popped up. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">adil</a> 16:29, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
